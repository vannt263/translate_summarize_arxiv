    "plasma heating by electron bernstein waves @xcite has been successfully demonstrated in several magnetic confinement devices @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this technique is that it offers the possibility to heat plasmas above the density limits of the standard electromagnetic modes . for a complete review of the ebw topic see @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , the emitted bernstein waves from the over - dense plasma core can be helpful for the plasma diagnosis in high density scenarios .",
    "see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite , where ebe is used as an electron temperature diagnostic and ref .",
    "@xcite where it is employed to measure the magnetic field .",
    "the tj  ii stellarator @xcite is a medium size heliac with major radius @xmath0 m , minor radius @xmath1 m and magnetic field strength on axis around @xmath2 t. in this device , the use of the available ecr heating sources two gyrotrons delivering 300 kw power each and injecting x  mode polarized waves at second harmonic ( @xmath3 ghz) is limited by the cut - off density for that frequency and that mode , i.e. @xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "two neutral beam injectors allow to heat the plasma above this limit and therefore , additional ecrh heating in nbi plasmas becomes possible only through electron bernstein waves .",
    "the heating scheme using bernstein waves for tj - ii is based on the o  x  b double mode conversion using low field side launching @xcite .",
    "as it is well - known , the efficiency of the o  x mode conversion depends strongly on the launching direction and the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "thus , in order to find an optimum experimental heating efficiency , a steerable mirror was installed inside the vacuum vessel , allowing a horizontal and vertical scan of the ecrh beam launching direction around the direction for which maximum o  x mode conversion efficiency is expected .",
    "note that a perfect optimization procedure should also include the displacement of the mirror center , since for each penetration location of the plasma wave a different well defined injection direction is required .",
    "this is not possible with the existing design .    in the present setup , the mirror",
    "can also be positioned so that the plasma radiation coming along the ebwh launching direction is redirected towards a radiometer antenna that measures thermal emission at 28 ghz . with this setup ,",
    "measuring and heating can not be performed at the same time . since both the ebwh and the ece / ebe systems share the same line of sight , the analysis of electron cyclotron radiation in plasmas above the o mode cut - off density for 28 ghz ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) may provide a very valuable information to determine the optimum direction for o  x  b heating . as a matter of fact , because of the low cut - off densities of the 28 ghz electromagnetic modes , any radiation detected in plasmas above this density must come from an inverse b ",
    "o mode conversion unless the contribution of the peripheral underdense plasma to the emission is high enough to mask the b  x  o component .",
    "this point will be addressed in the discussion .    in this work ,",
    "we present the theoretical characterization of the ebe resulting from b  x  o conversion , for different orientations of the launching mirror and different rotation angles of the radiometer , in the vicinity of the position that provides the maximum theoretical o  x conversion efficiency .",
    "the numerical results are obtained with the ray tracing code truba and the well - known concepts in traditional ece calculations , i.e. energy balance between emission and absorption as well as black body approximation .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with the experimental ones , obtained under ecrh + nbi discharges .",
    "the article is outlined as follows : section [ systems ] focuses on the description of the experimental setup ; section [ num_results ] deals with the numerical ebe calculations ; section [ exp_results ] is devoted to the experimental results and their comparison with the predictions presented in section [ num_results ] ; and finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes and discusses the main results .",
    "the appendix describes the calculation of the expected power in the different polarizations measured by the radiometer when it is rotated around its symmetry axis .",
    "the ebwh launching system consists of a corrugated waveguide that transmits up to 300 kw of microwave power into the vacuum vessel , where a steerable ellipsoidal mirror ( @xmath8 mm @xmath9 mm ) focuses the beam and defines the launching direction .",
    "prior to coupling the radiation to the waveguide , two elliptical focusing mirrors and two @xmath10 and @xmath11 plane polarizers provide a gaussian beam with the properly    , @xmath12 ) and for ebe detection ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . radiated power suffers two consecutive reflections and is coupled to the detection waveguide.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    polarized electromagnetic field .",
    "for the details of the ebw heating system see refs .",
    "the position of the movable mirror is determined by two orientation angles along the horizontal ( or toroidal ) and vertical ( or poloidal ) directions , @xmath15 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "if the launching direction is given by these angles , the radiation coming from this same direction can be redirected to the 28 ghz heterodyne radiometer using a different pair of angles @xmath13 and @xmath16 and a flat mirror attached to a corrugated waveguide , similar to the one used in the launching system ( see figure [ fig1:systems ] ) .",
    "after its passing through a glass focusing lens located outside the vacuum chamber , the radiation is detected by a quad - ridged dual - polarized microwave horn .",
    "the lens modifies the beam pattern at the output of the waveguide in order to obtain an efficient coupling to the horn antenna . for further details of the ebe diagnostic",
    "see @xcite .",
    "once the 28 ghz radiation reaches the horn , it is split into two separate components according to two orthogonal detection directions .",
    "properly calibrated , the sum of both signals , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , corresponds to the total radiative temperature @xmath19 . accordingly to the properties of an obliquely propagating o mode , an elliptical polarization is expected .",
    "therefore , in order to perform an experimental measurement of this polarization , the orientation of the detection directions may be changed from shot to shot by rotating the diagnostic an angle @xmath20 around its symmetry axis .",
    "actually , only the amplitude of the field components can be measured to some degree of accuracy and no information about the interacting phase between components and thus about the rotation sense of the polarization can be extracted .",
    "using purely geometrical calculations with the vacuum field configuration it can be seen that for @xmath21 , channel 2 ( ebe2 ) is aligned along the theoretical major axis of the expected o mode polarization ellipse .",
    "channel 1 is aligned along the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "see the appendix for a more detailed description of the diagnostic rotation and the expected polarization .",
    "the calculation of the b  x  o radiation has been performed with ray tracing simulations using the truba code , whose detailed description can be found in refs @xcite and @xcite .    from now on , the internal mirror angles that we set to collect the 28 ghz radiation will be referred as @xmath15 and @xmath12 , dropping the primes .",
    "to simulate the emission , we need first the ray trajectories obtained by tracing a beam launched from the corrugated detection antenna towards the plasma ( all the simulations have been done launching 121 rays , and for the standard equilibrium configuration , provided by vmec - based libraries @xcite .",
    "the maximum averaged @xmath22 never exceeds 1% , thus no significant modification in the equilibrium is produced , since tj - ii is designed to present a very small shafranov shift .",
    "the ellipsoidal mirror has been designed to focus the beam generated by the launching antenna .",
    "the incidence angles and the distance to the detection waveguide for ebe differ from the ones used in the ebw heating configuration and therefore , the mirror is no longer optimized for the ebe measurements .",
    "the changes that this lack of optimization may produce are neglected here .",
    "moreover , note that the ray tracing method has a fundamental limitation when it is applied to the o  x conversion process since it can not take into account the beam spectrum in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "therefore , the total o  x conversion efficiency obtained from adding the different contribution of each ray properly weighted with the gaussian beam profile differs in general from the o  x conversion efficiency of the real electromagnetic field of the beam @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this point together with the interpretation of the emission data when we come to the summary .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the result of a typical ray tracing simulation . the electron density and a temperature profiles used",
    "are fitted to the thomson scattering ( ts ) ones obtained in nbi - heated tj - ii plasmas . to calculate the electron bernstein emission ,",
    "the radiative transfer equation @xcite is solved along the trajectory of the o  x transmitted rays .",
    "the solution to this equation provides the emission intensity per unit frequency , which is given by the well - known expression    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is expressed in energy units , @xmath25 is the speed of light , @xmath26 is the wave angular frequency and @xmath27 is the optical thickness , with @xmath28 the absorption coefficient and @xmath29 the ray coordinate . for each transmitted ray ,",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] is performed along the ray path up to the inner boundary of the conversion layer , i.e. the sx  mode cut  off , in order to obtain the emission intensity @xmath30 prior to the single ray x  o tunneling process .",
    "taking into account the conversion efficiency for each particular ray , @xmath31 , and the gaussian beam profile weighting factor @xmath32 , we may write the total emission intensity as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the ray index and @xmath35 is the total number of converted rays .      in order to compare with the result of the experiments presented in section [ exp_results ] ,",
    "the ebe calculations have been carried out for different lines of sight .",
    "the experimental ts profiles have been fitted to the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where the set of parameters @xmath38 is found to match best the whole set of experimental profiles . a wide range of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 values have been considered .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows some of the experimental and analytical electron density ( a ) and temperature ( b ) profiles .",
    "the dependence of the electron bernstein emission on the mirror positioning angles is plotted in the figures [ fig : fig6 ] for a fixed central density and four different values of central temperature @xmath41 . as expected , the emission intensity increases with the electron temperature . in all cases , the maximum emission is located around @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "( a )  ( b )  ( c )  ( d )    it is observed that the emission finds a stronger dependence on @xmath12 than on @xmath15 .",
    "this is due to the more pronounced curvature of the plasma along the poloidal direction . on the one hand , this makes the incidence direction at the conversion layer deviate more sensitively from its optimum @xmath12 value than from the @xmath15 one , which affects to the conversion efficiency . and on the other hand , it changes appreciably the optical path of the rays and consequently the radiation reached at the o cut ",
    "off layer previous to conversion .",
    "and @xmath40 for the line @xmath44.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    regarding the dependence of ebe on central density , note that , as @xmath39 increases , the o  mode cut - off layer moves radially outwards .",
    "this modifies the o  x conversion efficiency @xcite through its dependence on the values at the o mode cut - off of the characteristic density gradient scale length ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath48 .",
    "the final combination of these effects is illustrated in figure [ fig : fig9 ] , where , independently of the central temperature @xmath40 , a maximum intensity is observed always around @xmath49 m@xmath5 .",
    "on the ebe diagnostic rotation angle .",
    "different non - polarized background radiation fractions are considered , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ]    by rotating the diagnostic we should be able to determine if there is a dominant polarization in the incoming radiation and if this coincides with the expected one . for the ideal case of a perfect elliptically polarized wave coming from the b  x  o emission , the power dissipated along each detection direction when the diagnostic rotation angle is set to some arbitrary @xmath20 is given by eqs .",
    "[ p1p2 ] of the appendix . in order to consider the presence of an unknown amount of non - polarized radiation we define    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is taken as a fraction of the maximum amplitude measured in channel 2 .",
    "a minimum in @xmath52 is expected for @xmath53 , when channel 2 is directed along the major axis of the polarization ellipse .",
    "the dependence of @xmath54 on the rotation angle @xmath20 of the horn antenna is represented in figure [ fig : fig10 ] for different values of @xmath55 .",
    "as it is clear , the greater the amount of unpolarized radiation , the flatter the @xmath52 profile becomes .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the time evolution of the main plasma parameters observed during a typical ecrh+nbi shot .",
    "plasma heating is first performed by applying 500 kw of second harmonic off - axis ecrh power .",
    "then , nbi heating ( @xmath56 1 mw ) is turned on and densities in the range @xmath57 m@xmath5 are achieved .",
    "ecrh power is turned off before the second harmonic cut - off density for 53.2 ghz ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) is attained .",
    "this provokes the drop in the ece signals , which still show a low plasma temperature until the nbi - induced electron density growth prevents the detection by ece means .",
    "the increase in the electron temperature and density during the nbi phase is accompanied with the subsequent raise of radiation observed by the soft x ray ( sxr ) detector .",
    "ebe and ece radiation after the ecrh turn - off are compared in figure [ fig : fig12 ] .",
    "the ece signal decreases faster because this diagnostic is looking to the plasma along a perpendicular line of sight whereas the ebe diagnostic is looking with a highly oblique view .",
    "thus , the 28 ghz emission comes from suprathermal electrons with a lower collisionality than that of the thermal electrons responsible of the emission detected by the ece diagnostic .",

    "is referred to the left axis ( blue dots ) . in order to remove its strong dependence on the temperature profile , which was not constant between shots , these values are normalized to the central temperature value ( @xmath60 ) provided by the ts diagnostic ( red dots , right axis ) .",
    "the scanned positions cover a wider area than the one considered in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the result presented in figure [ fig : fig13 ] is consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the measured intensity show an almost flat profile weakly dependent on @xmath15 . regarding the scan shown in figure [ fig : fig14 ] a stronger variation of the collected 28 ghz intensity on @xmath12",
    "is clearly manifested , as was also expected .",
    "the value for which a maximum emission value is obtained is @xmath61 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an acceptable result compared with the theoretical prediction ( @xmath62 ) , considering that the range of movement of the mirror along the poloidal direction is @xmath63 approximately .",
    "on the other hand this disagreement of approximately @xmath64 represents a noticeable deviation compared with the width of the ebe window along the poloidal direction , which has @xmath65 ( see figures [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if all the radiation received came only from b  x  o - converted one , the intensity should drop drastically out of the @xmath65 of width of the viewing window .",
    "since this is not what happens , it can be concluded that the amount of @xmath66 ghz disperse radiation collected by the mirror is far from being negligible .",
    "such a contribution of disperse radiation is probably coming from ebe emitted by the over dense plasma core all around the torus .",
    "this radiation leaves the plasma via b  x  o or b  x conversion and reaches the antenna after reflecting on the walls , which also provoke randomly changes on its polarization .",
    "compared to the theoretical estimation , for @xmath67 .",
    "a significant fraction of disperse radiation is found.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    a scan of the rotation angle of the diagnostic has been carried out in order to verify that the radiation reaching the mirror contains a direct contribution of o - mode polarized radiation .",
    "if this contribution exists , we should observe a similar trend in the experimental and the theoretical ratio @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "the polarization has been measured along the line of sight of the mirror for which the measured ebe intensity is maximum along the poloidal angle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] ) .",
    "this line of sight corresponds to the values @xmath68 and @xmath59 .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath20 was varied from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the experimental ratio @xmath71 measured at the ts acquisition time and the calculated one when @xmath67 , that is , the value for which the best agreement is observed .",
    "taking also into account the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] , it can be concluded that the background unpolarized field contributing to the measured intensity is of the same order of magnitude of the o - mode radiation reaching the detector .",
    "in this work a comprehensive study of the 28 ghz radiation rising from b  x  o conversion in over - dense tj  ii nbi - heated plasmas has been undertaken theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the numerical results have been obtained with the truba ray tracing code .",
    "as expected from an x  o conversion process , highly dependent on the wave propagation direction , a strong variation of the intensity has been found as the viewing angle along the poloidal direction is modified .",
    "it has been observed that the experimental maximum of the emitted radiation was shifted @xmath72 degrees with respect to the numerical estimations , which is not negligible compared with the approximately 4 degrees of width of the ebe window along the poloidal direction . as a task for a forthcoming work",
    ", a fine scan on this angle should be performed in order to resolve that maximum . regarding the maximum value of @xmath73 along the toroidal direction , the observation is in agreement with the theoretical prediction , since both theory and experiment shows an almost flat profile @xmath74 . from these results , an optimum experimental direction for forthcoming ebw heating experiments",
    "is extracted .",
    "( a )  ( b )    the polarization of the collected radiation has been measured in order to verify that the received radiation comes mainly from a b  x  o conversion process .",
    "the experiment has confirmed the existence of the expected o - mode component , importantly screened by disperse radiation .",
    "further discussion can be made on the possibility that this o - mode could be emitted from the under - dense plasma edge .",
    "this point is clarified in figs . [ fig16](a ) and [ fig16](b ) , which show the o - mode absorption coefficient for different values of @xmath46 in a cylindrical plasma with typical tj  ii magnetic field , electron density and temperature profiles .",
    "this has been estimated by using well - known expressions of the weakly relativistic absorption coefficient of electromagnetic modes @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , figure [ fig16](a ) represents the case where the density is below the o - mode cut - off , i.e. between 1025 and 1100 ms in figure [ fig : fig11 ] .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig16](b ) shows the over - dense case in the interval between 1100 and 1150 ms .",
    "the absorption coefficient in the over - dense scenario is three orders of magnitude lower than in the under - dense case . since in this situation",
    "the absorption of the o - mode is negligible in the edge , so is the emission coefficient . this allows to conclude that the o mode polarized radiation measured when in over - dense conditions can only be attributed to a b  x  o process .    a considerable amount of disperse radiation has been found .",
    "its presence can be understood by considering that the emission of ebws takes place all around the over - dense plasma column and reaches the antenna after many reflections in the vacuum chamber , which in turn produces a random polarization .",
    "further studies on the characterization of the disperse radiation using ray tracing are planned .",
    "this task results extremely important due to the role of this contribution to the deterioration of the ebe signal . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the disperse radiation together with the presence of the x  o conversion layer in between the emitting source and the radiometer horns , represents a handicap in the calibration of the ebe signal by traditional means if the electron temperature diagnosis in over - dense regime is aimed .",
    "note that x  o conversion layer act as a kind of @xmath75-spectrum filter that can not be taken into account in the calibration procedure .",
    "it could only be included a posteriori knowing the exact o  x conversion efficiency of the beam and assuming a symmetric conversion efficiency , which is not always true .",
    "moreover , as it was briefly mentioned in section [ num_results ] , the calculation of the beam o - x conversion efficiency by ray tracing is not accurate , making the final determination of an electron temperature a very hard task .",
    "finally , the improvement in the spatial resolution by considering a more collimated viewing pattern as in standard ece measurements could help to get rid of the disperse radiation .",
    "however , this will be accompanied by a x  o conversion efficiency drop due to the widening of the @xmath75-spectrum of the field associated to a highly collimated beam and , consequently , the ebe source for the temperature measurement would be strongly screened by the disperse radiation .",
    "this work has been partially funded by the spanish ministerio de ciencia e innovacin , spain , under project ene2008 - 06082/ftn",

    "already anticipated , the azimuth of the o mode polarization ellipse in this reference system can be obtained from geometrical calculations by finding the projection of the @xmath82 plane , defined at the plasma boundary , onto the detection plane of the horn , after the two successive reflections both in the elliptical and the flat mirror .",
    "furthermore , in order to couple an obliquely propagating ordinary mode at the plasma edge the wave must be elliptically polarized with an ellipticity angle @xmath83 given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the propagation angle at the plasma edge . for the standard tj  ii magnetic configuration and taking into account the fact that the detector is looking to the emitted wave ( the rotation sense of the electric field is reversed ) , we finally obtain the angles that define the polarization ellipse in the main reference system , i.e. @xmath88 taking @xmath89 the relation between these angles and the wave electric field is given by @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 determine the complex electric field amplitude through @xmath94rotated system defined by the two orthogonal directions of the ebe diagnostic : @xmath95.note that when @xmath96 , the vector @xmath97 is directed along the major axis of the polarization ellipse . therefore , the power detected in both channels , for an arbitrary angle @xmath20 , is given by            99 bernstein i b 1958 _ phys .",
