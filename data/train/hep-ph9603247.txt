    "the top quark has been experimentally observed at the fermilab tevatron by the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite with a measured mass around 175 gev . because it has a mass of the order of the fermi scale , the top quark couples quite strongly to the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector consists of a complex fundamental higgs scalar , but `` triviality '' @xcite and `` naturalness '' @xcite of the scalar sector suggest that the higgs sector may not be so simple .",
    "it is therefore plausible to assume that the mass generation mechanism is more complicated and the higgs sector of the sm is just an effective theory , and that new physics phenomena may be manifested through effective interactions of the top quark @xcite .",
    "if anomalous top - quark couplings beyond the sm exist , they will affect top - quark production and decay processes at hadron and @xmath4 colliders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such couplings would certainly affect certain low - energy quantities which are measured with high precision .",
    "one such possibility is the partial width ratio @xmath5 measured at lep - i , which is about 3@xmath6 higher than the standard model expectation @xcite and could be an indication of new physics associated with the heavy top quark .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental constraints on an anomalous top - quark coupling @xmath7 and the experimental observability of the induced rare decay mode @xmath8 , at the fermilab tevatron and the lhc at cern , have been investigated in detail . in this paper",
    ", we examine the possible anomalous top - quark coupling @xmath9 and its implications in both low and high energy processes . in our analysis",
    "we will also allow for the possibility of a @xmath10 coupling because it has a similar form to the @xmath9 coupling . since the standard model prediction of @xmath11 is unobservably small @xcite , any experimental evidence for the @xmath9 coupling will be an unequivocal indication of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine the constraints on the anomalous @xmath12 couplings from @xmath13 and from the limit on non - standard top decays at the tevatron . in section iii , we study the possibility of detecting the @xmath9 coupling at the tevatron and the lhc , paying particular attention to the kinematical characteristics to extract the signal from the possible background .",
    "the cuts are adjusted to the different physics requirements at the two accelerators .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce an effective lagrangian involving the anomalous top - quark couplings , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the standard model lagrangian and @xmath16 includes the anomalous top - quark couplings . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we consider only the lowest dimension , @xmath17-conserving operators which give rise to anomalous @xmath18 vertices",

    "we study its constraints on anomalous top - quark couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "anomalous couplings of various types associated with the top quark and their constraints obtained from low - energy processes have been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath13 is given by @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 runs from 1 to 8 , and @xmath33 denotes the energy scale at which @xmath34 is applied .",
    "the operators set @xmath35 consist of six four - quark operators @xmath36 , the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath37 , and the chromo - magnetic dipole operator @xmath38 . at the weak scale ,",
    "the only contributing operator is @xmath37 .",
    "however , when evolving down to the low energy scale @xmath39 , @xmath37 will mix with operator @xmath38 and others . here , @xmath40 are the elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix .    the partial decay width for @xmath13 is , neglecting the strange - quark mass , @xmath41 normalized by the inclusive semileptonic branching ratio , the @xmath42 branching ratio can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , with @xmath45 . in the standard model , the complete leading logarithmic approximation gives @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous top - quark couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 modify the coefficients of operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficients of these operators at the electroweak scale can be written as @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the standard model contributions .    using @xmath55 and the recent cleo measurement @xcite @xmath56 we plot the allowed region for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig .  1 , for @xmath57  gev , @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite . throughout this paper , we take @xmath61 tev . in the figure",
    "there are two allowed bands : the right band corresponds to a small anomalous correction to the sm @xmath62 coefficient which obeys the limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsglim ] ) , while the left band corresponds to a large correction which is approximately twice the magnitude of the sm contribution but of the opposite sign , so that the magnitude of @xmath62 is still consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsglim ] ) .    a further restriction on @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be obtained from the fact that @xmath63 and @xmath64 decays are not the most significant top decay modes as shown by the recent cdf data @xcite . a straightforward calculation of partial widths yields @xmath65 where the masses of the @xmath66 and @xmath1 quarks have been ignored . for the case of @xmath67 , @xmath68 is replaced by @xmath69 in the above equation .    the cdf data on the branching ratio of top decaying to @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath70 places the limit @xmath71 at the one standard deviation level , where the insignificant contribution of @xmath72 has been ignored .",
    "this constraint gives the limit @xmath73 and is shown in fig .  1 as the dashed lines .",
    "one can see that @xmath74 combined with @xmath75 has constrained @xmath27 very strongly .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) versus @xmath27 for the maximum and minimum allowed magnitudes of @xmath28 .",
    "specifically , we find that @xmath77 when accounting for the contribution of the @xmath63 decay to the total width . a similar constraint for the case with @xmath78 has been obtained in ref .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) versus @xmath28 .",
    "at the fermilab tevatron , the cross section for @xmath80 production is about 5  pb at @xmath81  tev . a detailed study of top - quark decays is possible with the expected 1  fb@xmath82/yr integrated luminosity of the main injector , or the 10  fb@xmath82/yr anticipated at the tevatron upgrade @xcite .",
    "top - quark production is much greater at the lhc , with a cross section being of order 1000 pb , due to the larger center of mass energy ( 14  tev ) and higher integrated luminosity ( 100  fb@xmath82/yr ) .",
    "therefore it is feasible to search for evidence of anomalous couplings such as @xmath83 at hadron colliders .    the decay @xmath64 has already been discussed in the previous section .",
    "to obtain the signal event rate , we calculate the top - quark production via @xmath84 with the lowest order matrix elements , but normalize the total cross sections to values which include order @xmath85 corrections @xcite .",
    "we thus find that the constant @xmath86 factors are @xmath87 for the parton distributions",
    "we use the recent parameterization mrs set - a @xcite . due to the enormous qcd backgrounds at hadron colliders ,",
    "it is very difficult , if not impossible , to search for the signal if both the top and antitop decay purely hadronically .",
    "we therefore look for events with one top - quark decay leptonically @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) , where @xmath90 . the cross section for such events is calculated using the exact matrix elements for an on - shell @xmath91 . we have ignored the spin correlations for the decaying top quarks since the top - quark production mechanisms we consider give insignificant top - quark polarization @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the calculated total cross section plotted versus @xmath27 , for two values of @xmath28 , for the process @xmath92 , where @xmath90 and @xmath93 represents a jet from either a @xmath1 or @xmath66 quark .",
    "the curves stop at the maximum allowed value of @xmath27 in each case .",
    "figure  3(a ) is for the fermilab tevatron ( @xmath94 collisions with @xmath95 tev ) , and fig .",
    "3(b ) for the lhc ( @xmath96 collisions with @xmath97 tev ) .",
    "we see that for the allowed values of @xmath27 , the signal cross section at the tevatron could be as large as 4  fb , which is rather small but still might be observable at the tevatron upgrade . at the lhc ,",
    "the maximal signal cross section is nearly 600  fb , which means that there could be a large number of events even for non - maximal couplings .",
    "we should remark that the top - quark production cross section is somewhat sensitive to the top - quark mass . for @xmath98  gev , for example",
    ", the cross section is reduced by slightly more or less than 50% at the tevatron and the lhc , respectively .",
    "the only irreducible backgrounds to the signal are electroweak ( ew ) @xmath99 production plus two qcd jets @xmath100 there are also possible `` fake '' events @xmath101 where one of the qcd jets fakes a photon .",
    "these backgrounds have substantial production rates .",
    "the signal is however distinctive : besides the isolated charged lepton and large missing transverse energy ( @xmath102 ) from @xmath103 decay , there is a highly energetic photon , and two hard ( @xmath104-quark ) jets with which @xmath105 and @xmath106 both reconstruct a top ( or @xmath107 ) . without requiring @xmath1-tagging ,",
    "our signal selection procedure is as follows : we first examine the two values of the invariant mass @xmath108 and @xmath109 and identify the jet which gives an @xmath110 value closer to @xmath111 as the @xmath66-quark jet .",
    "naturally , the other jet will be identified as @xmath1-quark jet . due to the missing neutrino from the @xmath91 decay ,",
    "the @xmath91 momentum ca nt be reconstructed unambiguously due to the lack of knowledge of the parton c.m",
    "this is known as the two - fold ambiguity in constructing the neutrino momentum along the beam direction @xcite . taking the @xmath91 mass as an input and for massless leptons , using the measured charged lepton momentum ( @xmath112 ) and the _ transverse _ momentum ( with respect to the beam direction ) of the neutrino ( @xmath113 )",
    ", the two solutions for the _ longitudinal _ momentum of the neutrino can be expressed by @xmath114^{1/2 } \\biggr\\ } \\>. \\label{plnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are therefore two solutions for @xmath115 , correspondingly .",
    "we again take the one that gives an @xmath116 value closer to @xmath111 . with this procedure ,",
    "both top - quark momenta are experimentally identifiable .    to make the calculation more realistic",
    ", we simulate the detector effects by assuming a gaussian energy smearing for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry as follows : @xmath117 where the @xmath118 indicates that the @xmath119-dependent and @xmath119-independent errors are to be added in quadrature , and @xmath119 is to be measured in gev .      to quantify the experimental sensitivity to the anomalous couplings",
    ", we first impose acceptance cuts on the transverse momentum ( @xmath120 ) , pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath121 ) , and the separation in the azimuthal angle - pseudo rapidity plane ( @xmath122 ) for the charged lepton and photon from the jets .",
    "we choose the following `` basic '' acceptance cuts : @xmath123 the high transverse momentum thresholds for the jets and the photon are motivated by the hard @xmath120 spectrum from the heavy top decay . with these basic cuts , the signal rate in fig .",
    "3(a ) is reduced by about 40% ( with a maximal value of about 2.7  fb ) , while the ew irreducible background of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ew ] ) is about 30 fb , and the qcd process for @xmath124 production in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcd ] ) is about 3000 fb .",
    "it has been shown that the fake rate for a jet to a photon ( @xmath125 ) at the tevatron experiments @xcite can be controlled down to a level of @xmath126 for @xmath127 gev , making it insignificant .",
    "therefore , the ew background dominates and we will consequently concentrate on that .",
    "figure  4(a ) shows the reconstructed distributions for the top - antitop invariant mass . obviously , @xmath128 for the signal has a kinematical lower limit ( @xmath129 if no energy smearing is applied ) ; while the lower limit is significantly smaller for the background , near the @xmath130 threshold . if we only accept events with @xmath131 we expect to improve the signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "also , due to the nature of top - quark two - body decay , the final state jets and the photon have transverse momenta typically the order of @xmath133 gev , while all the jets and photon in the background events tend to be soft . to further discriminate the signal from the background , we define two scalar sums of the transverse momenta : @xmath134 figure  4(b )",
    "shows the distributions for these variables .",
    "we see indeed that the signal spectra are much harder at the low end . on the other hand , they are limited by the physical scale @xmath129 for the signal at the high end , while they extend further for the background . with these in mind , our choices of the cuts are @xmath135 with the additional cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mtt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptsum ] ) , the ew background is reduced to about 10 fb , while the signal may be as large as 2.4  fb .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the reconstructed top - quark mass distributions @xmath136 and @xmath116 , after making the additional cuts in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mtt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptsum ] )",
    ". we see from fig .",
    "5(a ) that , despite the improvement in @xmath132 , the continuum background is still above the @xmath136 signal peak at @xmath111 .",
    "further improvement can be made if we only study the events with @xmath137 the short - dashed histogram in fig .",
    "5(b ) shows how the background in the @xmath116 distribution is reduced by the cut eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcg ] ) .",
    "we find that the signal peak is nearly unaffected by this cut and is now above the background , so that statistically significant effects may be observed near @xmath111 in the @xmath116 spectrum . if we examine the events in the mass range @xmath138 the signal observability should be nearly optimized .",
    "after the cut in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbw ] ) we are left with a maximal signal of 2.0 fb and an ew background 1.8 fb .      at the lhc energy , due to the more complicated hadronic backgrounds , we need to increase the transverse momentum thresholds , especially for jets , direct photons and missing @xmath139 .",
    "we adopt the `` basic '' acceptance cuts as @xmath140 the signal rates given in fig .",
    "3(b ) are reduced by about 60% with the cuts of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basiclhc ] ) ( with a maximal value of about 0.22  pb ) , while the ew background is about 0.5 pb , and the `` faked '' qcd background is about 70 pb . assuming that we can effectively reject the qcd background by photon identification to a level of @xmath141 for @xmath142 @xcite , then the dominant background is again the electroweak process .",
    "we see that after the basic cuts of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basiclhc ] ) the s / b ratio is much closer to unity than in the tevatron case .",
    "similar to the tevatron study , we have constructed distributions for the top - antitop invariant mass and scalar sums of transverse momenta ( see fig .  6 ) .",
    "we see that further background suppression can be achieved , without much loss of signal , by the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mtt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptsum ] ) .",
    "the signal integrated cross section after these cuts may be as large as 200  fb , while the ew background rate is about 300  fb .",
    "as at the tevatron , reconstructed top - quark mass distributions are also crucial to non - ambiguously identify the signal . figure  7 shows the top - quark mass distributions reconstructed from the @xmath105 and @xmath106 final states after making the cuts in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mtt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptsum ] ) . once the final cuts in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mcg ] ) and ( [ eq : mbw ] ) are made , the signal integrated cross section has a maximal value of 175 fb and the ew background is 33 fb .",
    "we see that the s / b ratio is significantly better than at the tevatron , primarily due to the huge enhancement for the @xmath143 production at higher c.m .",
    "energies .",
    "the cdf collaboration were able to achieve about 50% @xmath1-tagging efficiency @xcite and one hopes to reach about the same efficiency for the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "the impurity from the light quarks / gluons is assumed to be 1% .",
    "we therefore can naively expect to further suppress the backgrounds by a factor of @xmath144 ( where @xmath145 is the number of jets ) at a cost of signal reduction of 50% .",
    "one has to be cautious in making this statement since there is direct production of @xmath146 among the other light quark / gluon jets in the background events .",
    "we have explicitly calculated the @xmath147 production rate and found the cross section is about 0.12 fb at the tevatron and 1.1 fb at the lhc with the basic cuts plus eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mtt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptsum ] ) .",
    "this implies that the misidentified @xmath1 from light quarks / gluons is indeed the major background source .",
    "consequently , we will not carry out the calculation for the @xmath146 fraction in @xmath148 events , since this channel is always smaller to begin with .",

    "( [ eq : mtt])and ( [ eq : ptsum ] ) , and those plus @xmath1-tagging",
    ". we indeed obtain significant improvement for the signal / background ratios , although the signal rate at the tevatron is very limited .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings for a given accumulated luminosity , we first establish the approximate cross section formula for the @xmath150 case in terms of the anomalous couplings : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is calculated for the appropriate set of cuts , and the couplings are subject to the constraints in fig .  1 .",
    "the cross section @xmath152 is 80  fb and 6.8  pb at the tevatron and lhc , respectively , after the full set of cuts is made .",
    "we start with poisson statistics since the signal rate is often small , especially at the tevatron energy .",

    "the upper curves for each case are those with kinematical cuts only , while the lower ones are that including @xmath1-tagging improvement .",
    "we see that at the tevatron energy , minimal luminosity of about 5 fb@xmath82 is needed in order to probe @xmath27 near the current low energy constraints at 95% cl . at the lhc with 100 fb@xmath82",
    ", one expects to improve the sensitivity to @xmath27 by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "for instance , for @xmath78 and with @xmath1-tagging , the sensitivity at the tevatron reaches @xmath154 and at the lhc @xmath155 alternatively , setting @xmath156 and letting @xmath26 vary ( see eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) ) , we can view this as a probe of the scale of new physics up to @xmath157  tev at the tevatron and about 100 tev at the lhc .",
    "if @xmath158 , there of course is also the possibility of @xmath159 decay , which is only mildly constrained by current tevatron data .",
    "although the hadronic nature of the decay might make the detection of this mode difficult , the jets resulting from this decay will have large transverse momentum , and may allow one to distinguish the signal from the background .",
