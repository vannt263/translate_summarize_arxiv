    "the magnetic insulator @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 has received a considerable attention since 1996 , when isobe and ueda reported a spin - peierls - like transition at @xmath8  k @xcite .",
    "the structure of this vanadate consists of two - leg ladders formed by corner - sharing distorted @xmath9o@xmath2 pyramids running along the orthorhombic b - axis , with their rungs along the a - axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "neighboring ladders are linked via common edges of the pyramids to form the @xmath10-layers .",
    "na atoms lie between the layers . at room temperature ,",
    "the structure is centrosymmetric ( space group @xmath11@xmath12 ) with only one crystallographic position for vanadium having a formal valence + 4.5  @xcite . as a result",
    ", one electron is shared by two v atoms and is actually distributed over a v  o  v molecular orbital at the ladder rung . a quarter - filled ladder along the @xmath13-direction is formed , which explains one - dimensional magnetic properties of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 above @xmath5  @xcite .    below @xmath5 , a steep isotropic decrease of the magnetic susceptibility corresponding to a singlet - triplet gap of @xmath14=85  k  @xcite and a lattice dimerization described by the propagation wave vector @xmath15  @xcite",
    "were recently found to be accompanied by a charge ordering of a zigzag type  @xcite the nature of the state below @xmath5 is presently under intense investigation .",
    "the recent synchrotron x - ray diffraction studies of the low - temperature ( lt ) structure  @xcite resulted in the acentric space group @xmath16@xmath17 with three essentially different positions for the vanadium atoms arranged into a sequence of zigzag modulated ladders separated by nonmodulated ones ( see fig .",
    "the corresponding three vanadium valence states , + 4 , + 5 , and + 4.5 , have been suggested from the bond - valence analysis in ref .",
    "this finding contradicts the nmr observation of only two inequivalent electronic states of vanadium below @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "more recent bond - valence calculations suggest , however , only two vanadium valences despite the three crystallographically inequivalent v sites  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several observations , in particular , the properties of x - ray anomalous scattering  @xcite , can be better explained if one assumes the modulation of all the vanadium ladders , and therefore different subgroups of @xmath16 were considered  @xcite . in their raman scattering study of folded modes , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed the centrosymmetric @xmath18 group for the lt - phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 , from purely spectroscopic reasons",
    ".    folded modes of the dimerized lattice of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 have been observed first in the far infrared ( fir ) transmission  @xcite , then raman scattering  @xcite and fir reflection  @xcite measurements .",
    "only two out of more than thirty observed  @xcite new low - temperature fir modes , namely , the modes at 718  @xmath7 ( @xmath19 )  @xcite and 960  @xmath7 ( @xmath20 )  @xcite have been studied in detail .",
    "three lowest frequency raman lines ( 67 , 107 , 133 @xmath7 ) that emerge below @xmath5 have been attributed to magnetic singlet bound states  @xcite .",
    "the recent work  @xcite called this interpretation into question , however .",
    "thus , both the low - temperature structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 and the nature of the low - energy excitations still remain controversial .",
    "the necessary steps towards solving these problems include ( i ) an acquisition of precise high resolution experimental data on the properties of new low - temperature infrared and raman modes in all the principal polarizations and ( ii ) a theoretical analysis of the properties of modes folded into the brillouin zone ( bz ) center of the lt - phase from different bz - points of the paraphase .    the present work is devoted to the detailed high - resolution fir transmission study of the frequencies , widths , and shapes of additional low - temperature modes of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 for @xmath21 in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 polarizations . to understand , at least qualitatively , polarization properties , splittings , and temperature behavior of the folded modes , we perform lattice dynamical calculations of the phonon dispersion curves throughout the brillouin zone of the paraphase and of frequency changes due to lattice distortion and charge ordering below @xmath5 . possible manifestation of magnetic excitations and of the interaction between lattice , charge , and spin excitations in the fir spectra are discussed .",
    "samples of stoichiometric @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 used in this study were grown by a melt growth method using navo@xmath25 as a flux  @xcite .",
    "the process resulted in single crystals with dimensions from @xmath26 mm to @xmath27 mm along the @xmath28- , @xmath13- , and @xmath29-axes , respectively .",
    "crystals from different batches were used . for transmission measurements in the @xmath30 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 configurations , we prepared four thin samples cleaved perpendicular to the @xmath29-axis .",
    "their thicknesses were @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34@xmath35 m .",
    "for the measurements in the @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 geometries , two samples were used .",
    "one of them was 1.3 mm thick along the @xmath28-axes ( sample 2 ) .",
    "the other one was covered with epoxy and then polished to the thickness of 150@xmath35 m ( sample 1 ) .",
    "the samples were checked by x - ray diffraction , magnetization , and esr measurements .",
    "they exhibited a sharp transition at about 34k .",
    "the transmittance spectra in a polarized light incident normally to the sample surface were measured in the spectral range 252000  @xmath7 at a resolution 0.051.0  @xmath7 using a bomem da3.002 fourier transform spectrometer equipped with a helium - vapor optical cryostat .",
    "samples were mounted to a specially constructed cryostat inset that partially compensated thermal variations of the cryostat length .",
    "the temperature of the sample varied from 300 to 6k and was stabilized with the precision of @xmath39k .",
    "at each temperature , a reference spectrum was taken .",
    "for the case of sample  1 measured in @xmath40 polarization , transmittance is given relative to the layer of epoxy having the same thickness as the sample .",
    "precision of the experimental line position was 0.050.5  @xmath7 , depending on a particular line .",

    "this peak can be assigned to a missing @xmath50 phonon placed at 298  @xmath7 by lattice dynamics calculations for the high - temperature ( ht)-phase  @xcite and not observed in fir reflectance spectra  @xcite .    a broad absorption band centered at about 320  @xmath51 is present in @xmath20 spectrum ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "the @xmath28-polarized fir absorption continuum extends to about 1500  @xmath7 and consists of two bands centered at 300 and 1100 cm @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "drastic changes occur in the spectra of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 at the transition temperature .",
    "first , the long - wavelength part of the broad - band absorption in @xmath22 polarization decreases markedly , the sample becomes more transparent ( see fig .",
    "the changes of transmittance near the 178  @xmath7 phonon line in @xmath54 polarization are caused by a sharp narrowing of this phonon below @xmath5 .",
    "a special study is necessary to clarify the question , whether the changes of background transmittance observed in @xmath53 polarization can be explained by a similar reason , namely , by the changes of regular phonons 162 , 179 , and 282  @xmath7 below the transition temperature , or there is a weak broad - band absorption that diminishes below @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra modeling ( see below ) has shown that , indeed , a weak broad absorption band that bleaches below @xmath5 is present in @xmath53 polarization .",
    "the measured absorption coefficient at the frequency 115  @xmath7 is @xmath55 . to compare , for the @xmath20 polarized broad - band absorption @xmath56 .",
    "second , the shape of asymmetric peaks at 90 and 140  @xmath7 in @xmath20 spectrum changes to symmetric .",
    "third , numerous new spectral features appear below @xmath5 in @xmath20 , @xmath57 , and @xmath53 spectra .",
    "the first two phenomena were already discussed in our earlier publication  @xcite .",
    "we have attributed a broad band in @xmath20 polarization to two - spinon absorption , the asymmetric line shape being due to fano - type resonance between lattice vibrations and a two - spinon continuum .",
    "the opening of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum below @xmath5 leads to a vanishing of a low - frequency continuum and to the appropriate transformation of the line shapes .",
    "subsequent structure redetermination for the ht phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite does not , however , allow to ascribe @xmath20 polarized spectral continuum to a pure two - spinon absorption .",
    "symmetry considerations show that for both ht- and lt - structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 the two - spinon ( two - magnon ) absorption is allowed only in @xmath53 polarization  @xcite .",
    "probably , a weak fir absorption background observed in this polarization results just from the two - spinon absorption . in that case , the observed diminishing of this absorption in the low - frequency region of @xmath49 spectra would correspond to the opening of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum below @xmath5 and also one would expect to observe the magnetic bound states , if any , just in @xmath53 polarization . as for the @xmath20 polarized low - frequency continuum , it could be formed by two spinons and one low - energy charge excitation , as has been proposed recently by khomskii et al . in their paper on the spin - isospin model of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we concentrate our attention on the spectral lines that appear below @xmath5 .",

    "the temperature behavior of the majority of new lines is characterized by an appreciable broadening and small ( 0.22  @xmath7 ) but clearly detectable shifts near @xmath5 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the vibrational lines that exist both below and above @xmath5 also broaden and shift when approaching @xmath5 from below ( see insets of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "positions , widths , and oscillator strengths of the observed spectral lines that appear below @xmath5 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "these parameters were obtained from the following fitting procedure .",
    "the experimental transmittance spectrum at normal incidence was approximated by the expression  @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 in the case of clearly visible interference pattern , or by the expression @xmath66 in the absence of interference within the sample . here",
    "@xmath67 is the reflectivity of one surface , @xmath68 is the absorption coefficient .",

    "first of all , the calculated spectrum was fitted to the experimental one at t=37k , just above the temperature of the phase transition , starting from the room temperature values determined earlier in our work  @xcite .",
    "the fitting to the low - temperature ( @xmath7610k ) spectrum was performed in two steps .",
    "first , changes of the phonons that exist both in ht- and lt - phases were taken into account and , then , new oscillators were introduced .",
    "it should be noted that we could not study several spectral regions because of a too strong absorption of either the sample or mylar windows of our cryostat . in particular , the lines at 718  @xmath7 are only partially seen , being too close to a strong absorption band of mylar .",
    "results of the @xmath53 , @xmath77 measurements refer to the 150  @xmath35 m thick sample .",
    "we were able to detect the lowest frequency lines also in the 1.3  mm thick sample .",

    "the data on the 101.4 and 111.7  @xmath7 modes summarize a very detailed study of two samples with the thicknesses @xmath81 m and @xmath82 m .",
    "the intensity of the 101.4 , 126.7 , and 140  @xmath7 modes follows the same temperature dependence as the intensity of new x - ray reflections corresponding to the doubling ( a , b ) and quadrupling ( c ) of the lattice constants @xcite ( also shown in fig .  8) .",
    "this dependence is characterized by a steep rise just below @xmath5 and a saturation below @xmath83 22  k. the majority of the observed new lines behave like that , while several ones ( in particular , the lines 91.2 , 145.0 , 145.7 , 157.2 , and 451.1  @xmath7 in @xmath20 , 111.7  @xmath84 in @xmath78 , 70 , 106.9 , 126.7 , and 133.1  @xmath7 in @xmath85 ) demonstrate a more slow growth of intensity below @xmath5 and a saturation at lower temperatures .",
    "we could not measure reliably the intensity dependence of the very weak feature at about 133  @xmath7 in @xmath53 polarization but it seems to grow in the slowest way among all the studied modes and to follow the same temperature dependence as the spin - gap mode observed in optical esr measurements  @xcite ( also shown in fig .  8) .      according to the recent x - ray diffraction work  @xcite ,",
    "the structure of the low - temperature phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is face - centered , with @xmath16 space group on the @xmath86 supercell . the primitive cell corresponding to the translation vectors @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 contains 64 atoms and , hence , there are 189 optical vibrational modes .",

    "we have constructed the brillouin zones for the @xmath11 ht - structure ( it is shown in fig .",
    "9 ) , for the @xmath16 lt - structure , and also for the other proposed lt - structures and analysed what points of the bz of the paraphase fold into the new zone center and thus become optically active .",
    "results of this analysis are represented in table  [ tab3 ] .    in the case of @xmath16 low - temperature structure ,",
    "the two @xmath95-points @xmath96 of the paraphase and the eight @xmath97-points of the type @xmath98 deliver 48 singlets @xmath99 ( compatible with ( @xmath100 ) irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the @xmath95-point ) and , respectively , 24 quadruplets @xmath101 ( compatible with @xmath102 and @xmath103 doublets of the @xmath97-point ) to the bz center of the lt phase .",
    "they join @xmath104 singlet vibrational modes that originate from , correspondingly , @xmath105 vibrations of the bz center ( @xmath106-point ) of the paraphase .",
    "because of a degeneracy of the @xmath97-point folded modes , the number of additional frequencies observed below @xmath5 should be not so high as it followed from a simple factor - group analysis ( namely , 72 instead of @xmath107 ) .",
    "in the case of the face - centered structures @xmath108 , @xmath18 , or @xmath109 , there are 128 atoms in the primitive cell and , thus , 381 optical modes .",
    "in addition to the just mentioned bz points @xmath95 and @xmath97 , the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 points also fold into the zone center delivering 96 additional doublets . a lattice distortion in the lt - phase lifts a degeneracy of folded quadruplets or quadruplets and doublets and causes their splitting .",
    "we shall consider the polarization properties of the split components in the section  iva .",
    "we consider the lattice dynamics of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 in the framework of the rigid - ion model .",
    "the model incorporates long - range coulomb interactions and short - range interactions described by born - mayer potentials .",
    "the model parameters were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting to the ht - phase zone - center frequencies measured by optical techniques . in the present work ,",
    "we use them to calculate the phonon dispersion curves throughout the brillouin zone of the paraphase . as an example ,",

    "we do not show here the rest of 48 phonon branches .",
    "most of them exhibit pronounced slopes and complicated interactions .",
    "many ( but not all ) of the dispersion curves along the @xmath116@xmath95 direction are rather flat , reflecting more weak forces between layers in comparison with those inside a layer .",
    "only 12 out of 45 optical branches show a dispersion less than 6  @xmath7 ( 6  @xmath7 is a maximum line - width among the observed folded modes ) , and so the phonon spectrum of the lt - phase can not be described in the framework of one layer , as has been proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "our lattice dynamical model neglects electronic polarization and does not take into account three - body forces that strongly affect the frequencies of bending vibrations .",
    "because of that , there are several large discrepancies ( 5080  @xmath7 ) between the calculated and observed zone - center phonon frequencies of the high - temperature @xmath11 structure  @xcite and one can not expect a good quantitative description of phonon frequencies throughout the brillouin zone .",

    "however , the frequency differences between the observed fir and raman modes are within the precision of raman measurements .    to summarize , it is not possible to chose between the proposed space symmetry groups for the low - temperature crystal structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 on purely spectroscopic grounds .",
    "the number and polarization properties of all the observed new lt modes in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 can be reasonably described within the conception of folded vibrational modes of the dimerized @xmath16 crystal structure . observed fir doublets and close frequencies in different polarizations are naturally explained by their origin from the @xmath97-point modes folded into the zone center .",

    "as we mentioned in section  iiia , three of the observed new low - temperature modes , namely , modes near 70 , 107 , and 133  @xmath7 in @xmath49 polarization , have different frequencies in different samples ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "these modes and the mode near 125  @xmath7 ( @xmath49 ) demonstrate unusually large broadening , shift , and loss of intensity upon heating ( see figs .  6 ,  8) .",

    "the transitions between the singlet ground state and the excited triplet state are forbidden ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the dzyaloshinsky - moria ( dm ) interaction with dm vector along the @xmath29-axis breaks the selection rule for esr ( and fir ) @xmath49 transitions in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown theoretically @xcite that for @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 the dm interaction results in finite raman cross - section for both one- and two - magnon scattering processes .",
    "a single - magnon raman line of this type should show no splitting in an external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath29-axis but should split into two branches for a field perpendicular to the @xmath29-axis .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite communicated that the 67  @xmath7 raman line neither shifts nor splits nor even broadens in a magnetic field up to 7  t. they have attributed this line and the 107 and 134  @xmath7 raman modes to magnetic singlet bound states , on the basis of ( i ) the temperature dependence of the intensity , frequency shift , and linewidth , and ( ii ) the frequency dependence on a sample quality .",
    "all the three modes rapidly loose their intensity , soften and broaden on approaching @xmath5 from below @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that very recently two more raman modes with similar properties have been reported ( namely , 86 and 126  @xmath7 modes in ( ab ) geometry )  @xcite . to our opinion",
    ", the interpretation of the 67 , 107 , and 134  @xmath7 modes as magnetic bound states does not follow unambiguously from the above mentioned arguments .",
    "one of the main arguments in favor of considering 67 , 107 , and 134  @xmath7 raman modes as magnetic bound states was a slow increase of their intensity upon cooling . for comparison ,",
    "the intensities of the folded phonon raman modes at 202 , 246 , and 948  @xmath7 rose sharply below @xmath5 and then saturated .",
    "however , our measurements show that many of the transition - induced modes demonstrate a slow growth of intensity upon cooling below @xmath5 . among them",
    ", the considered mode near 107  @xmath7 ( @xmath53 ) and the folded phonon mode 111.7  @xmath7 ( @xmath54 ) behave in the same way ( see fig .",
    "different temperature dependences of the type @xmath158 ( here @xmath159 is the critical index of the order parameter ; @xmath160 ) for the intensities , frequencies and widths of the folded modes in the vicinity of a structural phase transition have been reported and analysed by petzelt and dvok  @xcite , taking into account anharmonic couplings between modes .",
    "in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 , as we show below , a mere charge disproportion may lead to the @xmath161 , intensity dependence for a folded phonon mode below @xmath5 , even in the harmonic approximation .",
    "intensity of a fir spectral line is proportional to a square of the electric dipole moment of a primitive cell induced by the respective vibrational mode .",
    "the dipole moment may be represented as a sum of products of effective atomic charges and corresponding displacements of bravais sublattices .",
    "a slow intensity dependence may be expected when the main contribution to the dipole moment comes from the charge disproportion terms that involve displacements renormalized by the order parameter .",
    "let us consider , for example , the @xmath162-component of the electric dipole moment due to displacements of vanadium ions that transform according to the @xmath135 representation of the factor group of the lt phase .",
    "the primitive cell of the @xmath16 structure contains eight v@xmath163 ions that form two rectangular plaquetts ( fragments of nonmodulated ladders ) in the neighboring @xmath10-layers , four v@xmath164 , and four v@xmath165 ions on the rungs of the neighboring ( left and right ) modulated ladders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "normal modes that correspond to @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 representations involve antiphase translations of v@xmath163 plaquetts along the @xmath29-axis and antiphase displacements of v@xmath165 and v@xmath164 ions along the same axis . at @xmath5 ,",
    "all the displacements have equal amplitudes , vanadium ions have equal charges , and the corresponding electric dipole moment is zero . at @xmath169 , nonzero dipole moment appears due to different amplitudes of the plaquette translations and different amplitudes of v@xmath170 and v@xmath171 ions .",
    "our calculations confirmed that , for some low frequency modes involving large amplitudes of vanadium ions vibrations , the effective electric dipole moment is determined mainly by the terms containing the charge disproportion @xmath172 and the differences between ion amplitudes at the temperatures @xmath173 and @xmath5 .",
    "these terms provide the @xmath174 dependence of the fir absorption .",
    "the same consideration is applicable to the raman spectra where intensities are determined by electric polarizabilities of lattice modes .",
    "thus , a slow growth of the mode intensity below @xmath5 is not a unique property of the spin - gap related excitations only .",
    "futhermore , if we compare the intensities of the fir new modes measured in this work with the integrated intensity of the spin - gap mode observed in optical esr measurements  @xcite , it is evident that only the 133  @xmath7 mode follows the same temperature dependence as the gap - mode ( see fig .",
    "now in fig .",
    "12 we compare the normalized magnetic gap energy , as observed in neutron scattering experiments  @xcite , and the normalized frequencies of the 70 and 106.9  @xmath7 fir modes .",
    "the latter change much more slowly on approaching t@xmath175 than the magnetic gap .",
    "we could not measure the frequency of the weak 133  @xmath7 fir mode below 24  k but the corresponding raman mode practically does not shift within the interval of @xmath176 from 0.2 to 0.88 , as one can see from the spectra of ref .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the peak positions for the lines near 70 , 107 , and 124.7  @xmath7 differ significantly from the dependence for the singlet - triplet gap , @xmath177 , while the frequency of the raman peak near 30  @xmath7 corresponding to a magnetic bound state in cugeo@xmath25 followed the same temperature dependence as @xmath177  @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "the comparison between the temperature - dependent intensities of the transition - induced fir modes and of the spin - gap mode show that the mode 133  @xmath7 is the only one that could be considered as a magnetic bound state .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of its frequency contradicts this hypotesis .",
    "thus , the assignment of the 70 , 107 , and 133  @xmath7 modes to magnetic bound states seems to be wrong .",
    "as an alternative interpretation we would propose folded phonon modes that strongly interact with charge and spin excitations .",
    "the interaction renormalizes the frequencies of phonons , causes mode broadening and softening near @xmath5 .",
    "a sodium defficiency strongly influences magnetic ( and charge ) states which leads to a strong change of interaction parameters .",
    "this circumstance could explain the dependence of 70 , 106 , and 133  @xmath7 mode frequencies on a sample quality .",
    "our earlier observation on the @xmath178-dependent phonon frequencies in na@xmath179v@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite supports such an assumption .",
    "we observed a giant frequency shift of 30  @xmath7 for one of the ( aa ) raman modes .",
    "namely , the 447  @xmath7 mode ( @xmath180 ) moved to 477  @xmath7 for @xmath181 .",
    "simultaneously , the maximum of a broad - band scattering moved in the opposite direction , from 632  @xmath7 for @xmath180 to 562  @xmath7 for @xmath181 .",
    "it was naturally to explain this change of the frequency difference between two raman bands by a change of interaction between the corresponding excitations  @xcite .",
    "though the exact nature of the broad band in the ( aa ) raman geometry is not yet clear , it must be connected with low - frequency electronic excitations on the ladder rungs  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between spin , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom is an intrinsic property of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 . in sodium vanadate",
    "one @xmath63-electron belongs to two vanadium atoms which gives an additional electronic degree of freedom .",
    "the electron hopping amplitude along a ladder rung is significantly higher than the amplitudes of hopping along a ladder or between different ladders  @xcite .",
    "zigzag charge ordering at low temperatures can be described as an antiferroelectric ordering of electric dipoles on the rungs of vanadium ladders  @xcite . as each electron carries the spin ( s=1/2 ) , charge and spin degrees of freedom",
    "are closely connected .",
    "to describe this situation , mostovoy and khomskii proposed a spin - isospin model and used it to show that the antiferroelectric charge ordering in the system of vanadium ladders opens a spin gap  @xcite .",
    "they argued that in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 the quasi - one - dimensional spin system is strongly coupled to a low - energy antiferroelectric mode ( isospin mode ) of the excitonic type and the observed charge ordering corresponds to the softening of this mode .",
    "the softening of the isospin excitation occurs at the wave vector of the superlattice structure appearing in the ordered phase  @xcite , that is , at the @xmath97-point ( @xmath182@xmath182@xmath183 ) .",
    "low - energy vibrational excitations of the corresponding symmetry should strongly interact with the isospin mode . to understand a possible mechanism of such an interaction we refer to fig .",
    "13 showing atomic displacements for vanadium atoms in the lowest - frequency @xmath135 mode ( at 136  @xmath7 , according to our calculations ) folded from the bz @xmath97-point into the zone center .",
    "vibrations are mainly along the @xmath29-axis , vanadium atoms at the two ends of a rung move in antiphase , that is when the left atom approaches the apical oxygen , the right one moves away from it .",
    "such a motion stimulates vanadium charge redistribution ( v@xmath184 )  @xcite that corresponds just to a static picture of charge ordering .    by inspecting the experimental results summarized in table  [ tab1 ] we notice that the lowest frequency @xmath135-symmetry modes ( @xmath80 ) are about an order of magnitude broader than the lowest - frequency @xmath138 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath139 ( @xmath54 ) modes even in the limit @xmath185 .",
    "they have the ratio @xmath186 in comparison with @xmath187 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 modes .",
    "such a broadening could result from a decay of the low - frequency vibrations into isospin and spin excitations , due to the interaction with them .",
    "high - resolution neutron inelastic scattering experiments on the spin excitations of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 revealed the two branches associated with distinct energy gaps  @xcite . at the zone boundary @xmath188 ( as well as at the zone center )",
    "these gaps constitute 68.6  @xmath7  @xcite ( 67  @xmath7 according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) and 91.1  @xmath7  @xcite ( 87.8  @xmath7  @xcite ) . keeping in mind the energy and momentum conservation laws , the following decay channels are possible",
    ": direct interaction with the zone center magnon or a decay into two zone boundary isospin excitations ( for the 70  @xmath7 mode ) , a decay into a zone boundary magnon ( 66 or 90  @xmath7 ) and the isospin excitation ( for the 106 or 125  @xmath7 modes ) .",
    "such a process corresponds to a hopping of an electron along the ladder rung and a simultaneous spin - flip . in that case , the zone boundary isospin gap would constitute of about 35  @xmath7 , in reasonable agreement with the theoretical estimates  @xcite .",
    "the lattice dynamics calculations for the high - temperature phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 predicted a soft mode behavior of the transverse acoustic mode at the bz boundary with @xmath189 .",
    "it was found to become unstable under charge redistribution below @xmath5 .",
    "so , one could expect a doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath29-axis , as a precursor of the subsequent magnetic ordering with a dimerization along the a- , b- , and c - directions . we have to mention that two subsequent phase transitions within the temperature interval of 1  k have been communicated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the discussed soft mode corresponds to the irreducible representation z@xmath2 of the bz @xmath190 point and it could be observed as a folded fir mode in @xmath134 polarization . we have thoroughly studied low - temperature @xmath28-polarized fir transmittance spectra of @xmath191 sample of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 in the spectral range 20138  @xmath7 but failed to find a soft mode .",
    "possibly , it has a frequency lower than 20  @xmath7 at 6  k or its oscillator strength is too small .",
    "another possibility would be that this soft mode is simply a property of our rather crude model of lattice dynamics .",
    "the @xmath49 polarized 70 and 107  @xmath7 modes demonstrate the strongest observed softening toward @xmath5 . but this softening is only of about 3  @xmath192 and is , probably , connected with the interaction of lattice modes with magnetic and charge excitations , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it looks like the true soft mode of the phase transition in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is of electronic nature ( low - energy antiferroelectric ( isospin ) mode  @xcite ) .",
    "in summary , we report the temperature - dependent polarized high - resolution fir transmission spectra of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 . the comparison with the results of neutron scattering and optical esr measurements and the theoretical analysis of the properties of vibrational modes in a charge ordered state lead us to the conclusion that all the transition - induced new modes of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 can be completely described in terms of folded modes of a dimerized lattice .    based on the present results ,",
    "the widely accepted interpretation of several lowest - frequency new modes as magnetic bound states seems highly unlikely . as an alternative interpretation of 70 , 106 , 125 , and 133  @xmath7 spectral lines we suggest low - frequency lattice vibrations of an appropriate symmetry that strongly interact with charge and spin excitations at the bz boundary of the high - temperature phase and fold into the zone center at the phase transition into a dimerized state .",
