    "after the discovery of the high-@xmath3 materials@xcite , there have been an increasing attention to the study of strongly correlated fermion systems . in his pioneer work",
    "@xcite anderson first pointed out that a doped mott insulator , described by the one band hubbard model , should contain the basic physics of the high-@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "the hubbard model was proposed independently in 1963 by gutzwiller , hubbard and kanamori@xcite . despite of its simple - looking hamiltonian and a lot of efforts ,",
    "the physics of the model is still a subject of debate .    in the large @xmath4 limit",
    ", it is more convenient to use a canonical transformation to project out the doubly occupied sites , costing energy @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to the so - called @xmath5-@xmath6 model : @xmath7 where the constraint of no double occupancy is understood . here",
    "@xmath8(@xmath9 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the corresponding density operator with @xmath12 , the symbol @xmath13 means summation over nearest neighbors , @xmath14 is the superexchange coupling and finally the spin density operator @xmath15 is defined by the pauli matrices @xmath16 : @xmath17 .    starting from a more realistic three band hubbard hamiltonian describing the copper - oxygen layer , zhang and rice showed that the low - energy physics of cuprate superconductors is determined by the singlet state formed by the additional hole on oxygen with the existing hole copper.@xcite they also showed that the hopping of this singlet is described by an effective one - band @xmath5-@xmath6 model , with @xmath6 and @xmath4 essentially unrelated .",
    "this makes the @xmath18 model even more appropriate to describe the copper - oxide planes at low energies rather than the original one - band hubbard model .    during the last few years",
    ", a huge amount of analytical and numerical work has been devoted to the study of the @xmath18 model.@xcite however the physics contained in the @xmath5-@xmath6 model is far from clear because of the interplay between antiferromagnetic long range order and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "exact numerical methods are usually limited to a very small linear size in more than 1d and practically nothing about the low energy physics has been understood numerically .    in this paper",
    "we will make a detailed numerical study of a simplified version of the @xmath5-@xmath6 model , _",
    "i.e. _ neglecting the spin fluctuations in the exchange term ( @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ tj ] ) ) and considering only the properties of a single hole . due to the simplification of the model , we are able to work directly in the infinite size system and have a satisfactory description for the low energy dynamics of a single hole in such a simple model of an antiferromagnet : @xmath20 a basic motivation of this work is to obtain reliable numerical results on this simple @xmath0 model since it may be useful for further investigation of the more interesting @xmath18 model .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 model was often used in the past@xcite to test several approximations on the @xmath18 model .",
    "in fact most of the physical properties of the @xmath5-@xmath6 model probably remain valid even for the @xmath5-@xmath21 model . from this point of view",
    "it is worth mentioning that the @xmath18 model and the @xmath0 model have the same limit for @xmath6 or @xmath1 and for infinite spatial dimensions the two model coincide , since the spin fluctuations are irrelevant in this limit.@xcite    the single hole problem represents certainly a further simplification but is still physically relevant , since the single particle excitations in magnetic insulators can actually be studied by the photoemission and the inverse photoemission spectroscopy .    for a single hole a rigorous theorem proven by nagaoka",
    "is known for @xmath2 .",
    "the so called nagaoka theorem states that for a bipartite finite lattice in more than one dimension ( @xmath22 ) the ferromagnetic state with maximum spin is the unique ground state with energy @xmath23 , in any subspace with given total spin projection .",
    "a complete description of the one hole spectrum in the @xmath2 limit , not limited to the ground state , was first given in @xcite , where the so - called `` retraceable path approximation '' ( rpa ) was introduced .",
    "in the ising limit as a hole hops in a nel state , it scrambles the spins along its path . in order to return the spin configuration to its original state",
    ", it was argued that , to a good approximation , one can consider only paths in which the hole retraces its path back to the origin , thereby returning all of the spins to their original position . in this approximation",
    "one can write down an explicit analytic solution for the green s function : @xmath24 and the spectral weight @xmath25 reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the spectral weight is completely incoherent and dispersionless with a one particle band , which is @xmath28 narrower ( in 3d ) than the noninteracting band .",
    "the rpa is exact in 1d and for the bethe lattice ( where nagaoka theorem does not apply ) , and recently it has been shown to be exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensionality .",
    "@xcite    for finite @xmath29 , the competition between the kinetic energy @xmath5 favoring the ferromagnetic configuration and the exchange energy @xmath21 favoring the antiferromagnetic alignment of the neighboring spins makes the problem of particular interest . by neglecting closed loops , e.g. in the bethe lattice case ,",
    "it is possible to derive a closed solution@xcite , which we will refer in the following as the `` string picture '' . in the string picture ,",
    "the hole moves in an antiferromagnetic spin background , leaving behind a string of overturned spins , which costs an energy proportional to the length of the path .",
    "the overturned spins behave like an effective linear potential for the hole . in the continuum limit ,",
    "valid for @xmath1 , the problem is reduced to a one dimensional schrdinger equation with a linear potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the length of the string . @xmath32 the solution of this hamiltonian leads to a series of bound states .",
    "the hole is essentially localized with a discrete energy spectrum : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the zeros of the airy function @xmath35 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the string picture is exact up to order @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the spatial dimensionality.@xcite    contrary to the @xmath2 case , at finite @xmath21 the spectral weight has @xmath38function peaks at energies @xmath39 . the weight of the @xmath38 function at the lowest energy is called the quasiparticle weight @xmath40 and is found to vanish linearly in @xmath21 , using the continuous limit ( [ string]).@xcite    later kane , lee and read@xcite introduced a self - consistent born approximation that can be considered an extension of the rpa to the more physical @xmath18 model .",
    "their approach is widely accepted since they were able to reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 model in the string picture and a large amount of numerical work on small lattices seems to be in qualitative agreement with the predictions of this theory.@xcite    in the retraceable path approximation or in the string picture and similarly within the self - consistent born approximation , closed loop paths are neglected in order to simplify the analytic structure of the one hole green s function . however",
    ", this certainly introduce an approximation even in the simple @xmath0 model .",
    "in fact the most important effect due to the inclusion of closed loop paths in this model was first noted by trugman.@xcite in 2d a hole can hop around a square plaquette one and half times without disturbing the spin background with a net translation to the next - nearest - neighbor along the diagonal .",
    "this means that the hole can `` unwind '' the string and self - generate a next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "the full localization of charge carriers found within the retraceable path approximation and the string picture is an artifact of the approximation .",
    "another interesting issue is whether the spin and charge degrees of freedom are decoupled or not.@xcite spin charge decoupling is a well known phenomenon in one dimension , where a one electron excitation can be decomposed into a spinon excitation which carries spin but no charge and a holon excitation which carries charge but no spin .",
    "we will show in the present paper that spin charge decoupling is an _",
    "exact _ property of the @xmath5-@xmath21 model in the bethe lattice with arbitrary coordination number @xmath41 at single hole doping and present some numerical work , ruling out the possibility of spin charge decoupling in physically relevant lattices where closed loops are allowed . in this paper , we make use of the lanczos method to calculate the single hole spectral function in the infinite system .",
    "we will first introduce a transformation to eliminate the charge degree of freedom to get an effective spin hamiltonian in a given momentum subspace ( section 2 ) .",
    "then we will use the lanczos method in order to diagonalize the effective spin hamiltonian in the infinite lattice ( section 3 ) .",
    "we will concentrate on two chains ( 2c ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattices .",
    "the 2c case is much easier for numerical study compared to the 2d lattice .",
    "the 2c lattice is not a trivial lattice for the @xmath5-@xmath21 model , because it has the basic properties of an higher dimensional lattice , such as the existence of closed loop paths and the validity of the nagaoka theorem .",
    "most of the above results were obtained by use of the lanczos spectra decoding method .",
    "this method allows us to analyze the lanczos data in the infinite system , where only a small number of lanczos iterations is possible ( section 3 ) .",
    "the validity of the lanczos spectra decoding is proved analytically and numerically on the bethe lattice ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    ", we will show our numerical results both for the @xmath2 and finite @xmath21 case .",
    "finally we will discuss about the formation of a ferromagnetic polaron around the hole for small @xmath21 , and about the analytic form of the spectral weight close to the nagaoka energy .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian ( [ tjz ] ) is translational invariant , so the most general one - hole state with total spin @xmath42 and total momentum @xmath43 ( hole momentum @xmath44 ) can be written : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a pure spin state that satisfies : i ) @xmath47 for all sites @xmath48 , ii ) @xmath49 _ i.e. _ the spin at the origin is fixed to @xmath50 , iii ) the total spin along the @xmath41-axis is a well defined quantum number in the state @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51 . the operator @xmath52 in ( [ state ] ) is the translation operator that brings the origin @xmath53 to the lattice point @xmath48 .",
    "it is formally defined by : @xmath54 states with definite momentum @xmath55 are eigenstates of @xmath52 such that @xmath56 .",
    "note also that the sum over @xmath57 in the definition of @xmath55 in ( [ state ] ) is used only for later convenience .",
    "a pure spin hamiltonian can be derived as following .",
    "we evaluate the expectation value of the @xmath5-@xmath21 hamiltonian on the one - hole state @xmath55 , @xmath58 , and consider first the case @xmath2 : @xmath59 now i ) @xmath60 since the total @xmath61 has to be conserved in order to give a non - vanishing contribution in @xmath62 .",
    "ii ) @xmath63 and @xmath64 , otherwise we create a doubly occupied site which is projected out either by @xmath65 or by overlapping with @xmath66 .",
    "finally we obtain that @xmath67 with : @xmath68 @xmath69 acts only on spin states .",
    "in fact for @xmath70 it is possible to express the term between parenthesis in terms of spin operators only : @xmath71 finally @xmath69 reads : @xmath72 note that the product of the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 appearing in @xmath69 permutes spins and leaves the origin @xmath53 unchanged .",
    "moreover , since the operator @xmath75 interchanges the spins at sites @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we have that @xmath78 and that @xmath79",
    ".    analogoously we can extend to @xmath80 the derivation of a pure spin hamiltonian and obtain : @xmath81 the full hamiltonian commutes with @xmath82 ( since it actually does not depend on the spin at the origin ) and thus it can be defined on @xmath83 sites .    in conclusion for any eigenstate @xmath46 of @xmath84 with definite latexmath:[$s^z_o",
    "@xmath0 hamiltonian written in the form ( [ state ] ) .",
    "in fact , by use of the variational principle any eigenstate of ( [ tjz ] ) or ( [ eff ] ) is obtained by @xmath86 , @xmath87 with the condition @xmath88 , @xmath89 respectively . since @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ", it clearly follows that all the eigenstates of @xmath84 with definite spin at the origin define a true eigenstate of @xmath92 by use of ( [ state ] ) . in conclusion",
    "the one hole problem is mapped onto a diagonalization of a pure spin hamiltonian @xmath84 for the given momentum @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite a similar effective hamiltonian can be obtained for the @xmath5-@xmath6 model , by substituting @xmath93 with @xmath94 in ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath84 is not translational invariant and that the momentum of the hole appears as a simple parameter .",
    "it is just this property that allow us to diagonalize the @xmath5-@xmath21 model in certain momentum subspace in the infinite lattice .",
    "as it is shown in the appendix many useful dynamical quantities such as the green s function and current operators can be easily translated in terms of spin operators acting on this spin space in which the hole is fixed at the origin .      following brinkman and rice@xcite",
    ", we can expand the green s function @xmath96 in terms of the momenta @xmath97 of the hamiltonian on the translation invariant ground state of the undoped system @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath2 , at vanishing doping , the hamiltonian is classical and @xmath98 is given by : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the two possible determination of the nel state .",
    "the one hole green s function can be generally written as a summation of all possible paths traced by the hole during its motion on the lattice .",
    "a path is then defined by a set of coordinates @xmath102 with @xmath103 , which are connected by nearest neighbor vectors @xmath104 @xmath105 among all the possible paths it is useful to identify the skeleton ones .",
    "@xcite a path @xmath102 of length @xmath106 is a skeleton path if @xmath107 for any @xmath108 . by definition , for any skeleton path",
    ", the hole never retraces its path immediately .",
    "it is clear that all the remaining paths can be obtained by dressing each site @xmath109 of the skeleton path by all possible retraceable paths .",
    "the retraceable paths can be then summed exactly .    instead of giving the detailed derivation",
    ", we will present the final result and discuss some of the special cases .",
    "the most general green s function can be written in a formal expansion of skeleton paths of length @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the brinkman rice result ( [ greenbr ] ) , which includes only retraceable path contribution starting from the origin @xmath113 and coming back to the same site : @xmath114 while the function @xmath115 is the exact contribution of all possible retraceable paths on each site of the skeleton path different from the origin : @xmath116\\ ] ] finally in ( [ green ] ) the coefficients @xmath117 are determined by : @xmath118 , where @xmath119 are spin correlation functions , which , generally speaking , depend on the path , @xmath120 in the ising case @xmath121 vanish for odd @xmath106 and are simply equal to either zero or one for even @xmath106 depending on whether the skeleton path change the nel order or not . instead they are complicated correlation functions in the @xmath18 model for @xmath122 . in this case",
    "the expression ( [ green ] ) is still valid provided we include the odd @xmath106 contributions .",
    "two possible limits can be exactly solved using the previous expression ( [ green ] ) for the green s function .",
    "the bethe lattice is defined on a cailey - tree with coordination @xmath41 and for @xmath123 it coincides with the one dimensional chain . in the bethe lattice",
    "there is only one path that connects two arbitrary sites of the lattice because there are no closed loops in this lattice ( see e.g. @xcite for a more detailed definition of the bethe lattice ) . as in one dimension",
    "there is only one skeleton path connecting the origin to a given point @xmath48 and @xmath124 , which is only a function of the final position @xmath125 .",
    "we can immediately write the exact expression of the green s function on a bethe lattice using the previous general expression ( [ green ] ) : @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "it is interesting that the `` strong correlation '' in the one hole problem in the bethe lattice is only contained in the static function @xmath128 , since @xmath129 is exactly the free electron green s function .",
    "this has direct consequences on the spin charge decoupling .",
    "( see next section )      let us consider the diagonal green s function @xmath130 for the @xmath5-@xmath21 model . in the general expression ( [ green ] ) , @xmath119 is either one or zero depending on whether a given permutation preserves the nel order or not .",
    "the shortest skeleton paths with @xmath131 is known to be three times the path around the elementary square plaquette .",
    "thus @xmath132 for such a skeleton path . there are @xmath133 possibilities to build such a path starting from the origin in 2d ( 4 neighbors times 2 possible opposite directions ) and @xmath134 in dimension @xmath37 .",
    "then the next leading correction to the brinkman and rice result is @xmath135 since @xmath136 for any @xmath137 , the correction to the brinkman and rice result turns out to be less then @xmath138 in @xmath139 and @xmath140 in @xmath141 .",
    "this has also been noted in @xmath142 expansion@xcite but appears also quite natural in this formalism .      in 1d , if spin charge decoupling occurs , the one particle green s function can be written as a simple product of a spinon contribution and a holon contribution : @xmath143 this property is exact in @xmath144 for the infinite @xmath4 hubbard model and is asymptotically valid for large @xmath145 at finite @xmath4.@xcite    the spin charge decoupling manifests itself in the one particle green s function and in principle can be detected even at higher dimensionality as speculated by several authors following p.w .",
    "anderson.@xcite for @xmath146 , or @xmath147 one expects no dynamics for the spinons and that the holon contribution has exactly the free particle behavior , because there is only a unitary charge carried by the single hole .",
    "thus , as a consequence of spin charge separation , the one hole green s function should be written in the following way : @xmath148 the free electron green s function is nothing but the free propagator in the nagaoka limit : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the energy of a free hole .    by fourier",
    "transforming in time and by taking the imaginary part of the equation ( [ greensep ] ) we obtain the spectral weight as a function of the final position of the hole and the frequency @xmath137 : @xmath151 the previous expression is exact in one dimension even for this simplified @xmath0 model where the spinon function is particularly simple @xmath152.@xcite by eq .",
    "( [ bethegreen ] ) spin - charge decoupling is valid in the bethe lattice for the single hole problem",
    ".    equation ( [ asep ] ) can be considered as a direct and measurable consequence of spin - charge separation .",
    "in fact , by measuring the spectral weight for two different positions of the hole we should get that the ratio : @xmath153    the ratio @xmath154 , according to expression ( [ ratio ] ) , should be independent of @xmath137 if spin - charge decoupling occurs .",
    "this is unlikely in dimension higher than one as the presence of the skeleton paths strongly renormalizes the spectral weight with the distance of the hole from the origin.@xcite the absence of spin - charge decoupling is particularly evident already for the 2c case ( fig.[scd ] ) , where @xmath155 is @xmath137 dependent for relatively large @xmath48 and quite low energy .",
    "based on the numerical and the analytical results , we conclude that spin - charge decoupling can occur mainly in lattices where closed loop paths are forbidden by the geometry . in these type of lattices the nagaoka theorem can not be applied .",
    "we have thus found an interesting relation between the nagaoka theorem , spin charge decoupling and presence or absence of skeleton paths in a given lattice . of course we can not rule out more complicated form of spin - charge decoupling such as the one discussed in @xcite , or that at finite doping the situation may change.@xcite",
    "the lanczos technique is widely used in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "contrary to the quantum monte carlo technique , it does not suffer the `` fermion sign problem '' or any other instabilities at low temperature .",
    "dynamical correlations can be easily obtained using this technique .",
    "however , it has been restricted so far to small systems , typically @xmath156 ( for hubbard models ) , or at most 26 sites ( for @xmath5-@xmath6 and @xmath5-@xmath21 models ) and 36 sites ( for heisenberg models).@xcite on the other hand a systematic way for a finite - size scaling analysis in doped system such as the @xmath5-@xmath21 model is not known yet and some infinite - system properties are still unclear or even misleading .    in this section",
    ", we will develop a scheme , which allows us to analyze the infinite system lanczos data in a very efficient way , so that we are able to calculate the spectral function of the @xmath5-@xmath21 model with good accuracy .",
    "the lanczos method is devised to diagonalize huge hamiltonian matrix with dimension @xmath157 .",
    "the method starts with a trial wave function @xmath158 . a new basis is generated by hamiltonian multiplication",
    ", @xmath159 then an orthogonal basis \\ { @xmath160 } can be iteratively calculated , after orthogonalization of the vectors @xmath161 .",
    "formally we have @xmath162 where @xmath163 , @xmath164 in the lanczos basis , the hamiltonian turns to a tridiagonal form where @xmath165 are the diagonal elements and @xmath166 the off - diagonal ones for @xmath167 .    for @xmath168 , the spectrum of the tridiagonal matrix coincides with the one of the original hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately the dimension of the hilbert space is usually given by @xmath169 , and it is prohibitive to perform a full diagonalization with the available computers .",
    "nevertheless the ground state and the corresponding energy converge for relatively small @xmath170 .",
    "this justifies the success of the method which enables to restrict the diagonalization to a very small basis @xmath171 where , according to the ritz theorem , the variational principle applies for all the eigenvalues of the smaller tridiagonal matrix and in particular for the ground state energy .      in an infinite system ,",
    "the lanczos scheme ( [ basis ] ) can be applied efficiently , provided there is a proper way to define a simple _ finite _ basis to represent the vectors @xmath172 ( [ defsi ] ) , generated by the iterative application of @xmath92 to the trial state .",
    "this is in fact the case for the effective @xmath5-@xmath21 hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) , where @xmath161 is represented by overturned spins on the nel state localized around the hole . for any fixed momentum @xmath44 , we start from a nel state with a hole at origin . since the @xmath21 term of the hamiltonian is diagonal , the only part of the effective @xmath5-@xmath21 hamiltonian , relevant to generate new states , is the kinetic term . in each multiplication of the effective hamiltonian",
    ", the hole is translated to its @xmath41 nearest neighbors by the translation operator @xmath173 ( see fig.([effp ] ) ) .",
    "then the spin exchange operators @xmath174 move the hole back to the origin , leaving an overturned spin background and generating @xmath41 new states .    the possibility to work with a finite basis even in the infinite system",
    "was first noted by trugman@xcite .",
    "in fact the overturned spins are located within a region around the hole with radius @xmath106 .",
    "we can thus update only the defects over the nel state , which are finite at any finite number of multiplications of @xmath92 .",
    "after @xmath106 steps , the hilbert space is finite having at most dimension @xmath175 .",
    "this exponential growth of the hilbert space @xmath176 makes the problem intractable even for relatively small @xmath106 .",
    "fortunately many of the generated states appear several times during the expansion of the hilbert space , due to the presence of the trugman - like paths,@xcite and also due to the translation symmetry implicitly exploited by use of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "after all , the dimension of the hilbert space turns out to be considerably smaller than the previous estimate , and in fact it grows much slower than @xmath175 , e.g. @xmath177 for @xmath178 . in this way we have reached @xmath179 for the 2c case and @xmath180 for the 2d case with an hilbert space dimension at most equal to @xmath181 .",
    "the _ smallest _ finite lattice which contains the full information of the first exact @xmath106 lanczos steps has linear dimension @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , our results correspond to a @xmath183 lattice in the @xmath184 case and to a @xmath185 in 2d , which is by far larger than the size of a typical finite size lanczos calculation@xcite .",
    "however the finiteness of @xmath106 often leads to appreciable systematic errors . in these cases",
    "we overcome this difficulty by carrying out a systematic extrapolation in @xmath186 , following a scheme which is analogous to the finite size scaling analysis for finite lattice calculations .",
    "we conclude this section with some technical comments about the algorithm .",
    "the basis generated by the iterative application of @xmath69 does not depend on the momentum @xmath44 of the hole .",
    "hence we only need to generate it once , which takes less than two hundred seconds of cpu time on a cray - c90 .",
    "after that , we can do the usual lanczos iterations for fixed parameters @xmath44 and @xmath21 , which typically takes @xmath187 seconds of cpu time on the same computer .      with the @xmath188 eigenvalues @xmath189 and eigenfunction @xmath190 of the lanczos matrix truncated after @xmath106 step",
    ", the spectral weight can be formally calculated as @xmath191 in the following we assume that the energies @xmath189 are set in ascending order : @xmath192 .    as a result of the finiteness of the restricted hilbert space , we get a sum of @xmath193-functions in the spectral weight at any fixed @xmath106 . due to the lehmann representation of the spectral function@xcite",
    "this feature is also present in any finite size calculation . in this case",
    "the thermodynamic limit is obtained by smoothing the @xmath193-functions in eq .",

    "in fact by the conventional method of smoothing the @xmath38functions described in ( [ deltasmooth ] ) , either one miss the details of the spectral weight for large @xmath193 or in the opposite case one gets too rapid oscillations which are obviously unphysical.@xcite    a more efficient method for evaluating the spectral weight was recently introduced by us.@xcite in the following , for reason of completeness we will give a brief review of this new method named lanczos spectra decoding . in this simple method",
    ", we introduced an interpretation of the lanczos scheme . with this interpretation",
    ", the spectral function can be calculated accurately , efficiently and easily even with a small number of iterations @xmath106 . as we have seen in fact the lanczos scheme in the infinite system",
    "has a computational cost growing exponentially with @xmath106 , whereas in any finite size calculation the algorithm is only linear in @xmath106 . we expect therefore that our method is essential in the first case but maybe helpful only for a small computer - time factor in a finite size calculation .    as well known",
    "the spectral weight @xmath196 is a distribution that may be divided into two parts @xmath197 , a coherent one @xmath198 which contains only @xmath38function contributions and an incoherent one @xmath199 which is a continuous and usually smooth function of @xmath137 .",
    "the lanczos spectra decoding exploits the smoothness properties of @xmath200 in a simple and efficient way . in the following",
    "we therefore assume that the spectral weight is incoherent .",
    "this is not a limitation since coherent peaks can be easily separated out from the incoherent part by identifying all the quasiparticle weights @xmath201 that remain finite for @xmath202 .",
    "if the spectral weight is incoherent , since by completeness @xmath203 , one expects that @xmath204 . thus @xmath205 may define a smooth function of @xmath137 at the discrete lanczos energies @xmath206 .",
    "the full spectral weight is then closely related to the previous function : @xmath207 where @xmath208 represents the lanczos density of states ( ldos ) in the restricted hilbert space generated by the lanczos algorithm : @xmath209 where the factor @xmath210 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath211 . for @xmath168 in a finite system , @xmath208 coincides with the actual density of states of the many body system , but , in an infinite lattice ( @xmath212 ) , this is not generally true , as it will be shown for the bethe lattice case .    by definition ,",
    "the number of states @xmath213 between energies @xmath214 and @xmath215 is given by @xmath216 so the lanczos density of states can be calculated as @xmath217 finally , using finite difference instead of differential , the coarse grained lanczos density of states can be estimated up to order @xmath218 by @xmath219 where the energies @xmath220 lie at the middle of two consecutive eigenvalues .",
    "the function @xmath221 which is known at energies @xmath189 can be easily interpolated at the energies @xmath222 where also @xmath208 is known : @xmath223 if @xmath221 is a twice - differentiable function , eq .",
    "( [ zetad ] )   is accurate up to @xmath218 as well .",
    "thus within the same accuracy @xmath224 easily follows at the discrete energies @xmath225 : @xmath226    the knowledge of @xmath196 close to the previous `` special '' points @xmath222 can be easily achieved by standard piecewise interpolations or extrapolations . at the end , we can verify the sum rule @xmath227 , as a check for the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "in this section we will show that @xmath221 and @xmath228 are well defined functions and can be calculated exactly in the bethe lattice .    on the bethe lattice ,",
    "the problem is exactly solvable because the skeleton paths are absent and the retraceable paths can be summed analytically .",
    "this exact solution has two meaning for us : ( 1 ) as a test for our scheme and assumptions , ( 2 ) as an hint to interpret the lanczos scheme for the physical 2c and 2d lattices .    using the lanczos basis defined in eq.([basis ] ) , the hamiltonian has vanishing diagonal part ( @xmath229 ) and @xmath230 this easily follows since , on the bethe lattice , each multiplication of the hamiltonian generates @xmath231 new states , except for the first iteration , which generates @xmath41 states . due to the simplicity of such lanczos matrix",
    "it is then possible to compute analytically @xmath40 and @xmath208 in eqs.([zweight],[rho ] ) .",
    "by use of the lanczos spectra decoding introduced in the previous section we have obtained a good approximation to the exact solution with @xmath247 , much less than in the conventional calculation.@xcite    at finite @xmath21 , the only change is with the diagonal part of the lanczos matrix @xmath248 this result can be easily obtained by counting the number of broken bonds in the states generated at different lanczos iterations . in this formalism",
    "we obtain therefore that the motion of a hole in a bethe lattice is exactly equivalent to a one dimensional motion of a particle in a linear potential , provided we identify the distance of the particle from the origin with the label @xmath10 of the lanczos basis .    by diagonalizing numerically the lanczos matrix for large @xmath106 we can easily confirm the prediction of the long wavelength hamiltonian ( [ string ] ) , namely that the spectral function is @xmath249independent , and that @xmath196 contains only @xmath38function peaks .",
    "in fact due to the linear potential _ all _ of the one - hole states are localized states .",
    "it is important to remark that the corrections to the asymptotic @xmath1 behavior is quite important for the quasiparticle weight @xmath40 even for very small @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath40 the correct linear behavior @xmath250 is found only for @xmath251 ( see fig.([stringz ] ) ) , whereas the behavior of the ground state energy and the gap are more reasonable .",
    "for @xmath2 the spectral weight @xmath196 is an even function of @xmath137 and in the following we will concentrate on its negative frequency region .",
    "in this model we found @xcite a sharp peak in the spectral weight located at an energy close to the retraceable path prediction , @xmath252 , and , a second peak at energy @xmath253 . in the 2d case",
    ", the spectral weight looks similar , although the first peak is rather small . in 1d",
    ", the exact br solution leads only to one peak but with a divergent spectral weight @xmath254 at the bottom @xmath255 of the band .",
    "already in the 2c case such a divergence disappears within the retraceable path approximation , as well as in our numerical scheme , which includes all closed - loop paths .",
    "we also found that the first peak in the spectral function has a remarkable dispersive feature although the bottom of the spectrum appears @xmath256-independent .",
    "the dispersion of the first peak is not present neither in 1d or in infinite dimension@xcite and the importance to go beyond the retraceable path approximation is already clear even in 2d .    for the density of states",
    "@xmath257 , our results present some small oscillations around the retraceable path analytic solution ( [ greenbr ] ) . in 2d",
    "however the retraceable path expression for @xmath258 seems already quite accurate , at least away from the band tails.@xcite all the above results have been confirmed recently .@xcite    as discussed in the introduction a key question is the determination of the band edge energy @xmath255 , i.e. the threshold energy where the spectral weight begin to vanish . as a first step we identify the lanczos ground state energy @xmath39 for @xmath259 as @xmath255 , which may or may not converge to the nagaoka energy @xmath260 . for instance , by neglecting closed loop paths , one obtains the brinkman - rice energy @xmath261 as a variational estimate of @xmath262 . in the retraceable path approximation @xmath255 coincides with @xmath262 , as one generally expects .    in order to have an accurate estimate of @xmath262",

    "( [ rhod ] ) , @xmath267 , yielding @xmath268 for @xmath2 the inclusion of the skeleton paths seems to support a finite lanczos density of states ( see fig.([ldos ] ) ) , yielding , by the same argument @xmath269 we have plotted in fig.([ground0 ] ) the estimated ground state energies as a function of @xmath270 for several momenta for the 2d and the 2c cases .",
    "many of the estimated lanczos energies  exact upper bound of the true ground state energy are clearly below @xmath261 ( even for the 2d case also shown in the picture ) .",
    "thus , a previous suggestion that the one hole energy in a quantum antiferromagnet should be close to @xmath261 @xcite _ is not confirmed _ by our numerical results . in fig.([ground0 ] ) -2c case- it is remarkable that all of the extrapolated energies are very close to the nagaoka energy , independent of the momentum of the hole , i.e. @xmath271 .    the above results give a robust evidence that @xmath272 is finite up to the nagaoka energy . even in this case the spectral weight @xmath273 can in principle vanish for @xmath274 due to the vanishing of the factor @xmath221 .",
    "this is the scenario suggested in @xcite using the expansion for the green s function in terms of @xmath115 ( [ green ] ) . in the interval @xmath275 ( for @xmath276 )",
    "when the expansion ( [ green ] ) converges the green s function is surely real , thus determining a lower bound for @xmath255 .",
    "after some extrapolation it was found in @xcite that @xmath277 , i.e. @xmath255 should be higher than @xmath260 for the 2c or the 2d case using the first 18 or 12 coefficients @xmath278 of the green s function expansion , respectively . although the above analysis is surely correct , the basic conclusion is affected by systematic errors due to the limited knowledge of a few coefficients in the expansion .    as it is shown in fig.[weight0 ] , this scenario looks unlikely within the lanczos spectra decoding method because @xmath221 seems to be smoothly connected to the nagaoka energy .",
    "it is clear however that this is not enough for a definite conclusion .    in order to solve the latter controversy without relying on the lanczos spectra decoding",
    ", we have reproduced the mller - hartmann  ventura expansion ( table i ) and extended it up to the first 26 coefficients for the 2c case . since we have generated all of the @xmath161 , defined in ( [ defsi ] ) , up to @xmath279 for the 2c case , the total number of paths of length @xmath280 can be easily calculated as @xmath281 by proper undressing the retraceable paths , we can convert the total number of paths @xmath282 to the number of the skeleton paths @xmath283 .",
    "as it is shown in table i the mller - hartmann  ventura extrapolation : @xmath284 used to determine the radius of convergence @xmath285 is not stable when large skeleton paths are included . for large @xmath106 , we find that @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 are always going up . at @xmath179 ,",

    "this kind of analysis is much more stable than the extrapolation used in @xcite . in fig.([mh ] ) the data for the linear intercept @xmath300 suggests that the @xmath301 corrections are well behaved , and approximately linear for @xmath302 . by accident",
    "this number is very close to the maximum @xmath106 available in the previous analysis @xcite , giving further evidence that for this problem a very large number of coefficients @xmath283 are necessary to obtain reasonably converged results .",
    "then , by a linear fit in the region @xmath303 , we obtain @xmath304 within one per cent , both for @xmath305 and for @xmath306 , as an independent check that @xmath285 should not depend on @xmath48 ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the band edge energy coincides with the nagaoka energy .    for the 2d case the data shown in fig .",
    "( [ mh2d ] ) indicate that the above analysis is poorly converged due to a too much small value of @xmath180 .",
    "this also explains why the extrapolated @xmath308 results for @xmath309 , shown in fig([ground0 ] ) , does not converge to @xmath260 in 2d .",
    "for the critical exponent @xmath292 we have a much less accurate result probably because the vanishing of the spectral weight close to @xmath260 is characterized by overall essential singularities of the type @xmath310 , as we have suggested in our previous paper.@xcite    here we can give a very simple argument supporting the expected singular behavior for @xmath221 .",
    "for the spectral weight the behavior close to @xmath260 should be the same , because , as we have previously shown , the lanczos density of states is approximately constant in this region .",
    "after @xmath106 lanczos steps the hole forms a polaron state @xmath311 with maximum spin but total @xmath312@xcite in a region of linear size @xmath313 , as it is also confirmed by direct calculation of the spin arrangement around the hole ( see next section ) .",
    "the overlap of the nel state and this trial state is then approximately given by @xcite : @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the volume of the polaron equal to @xmath316 for the 2c case and @xmath317 for general spatial dimension @xmath318 .",

    "a coherent part shows up in the spectral weight .",
    "however , contrary to the string picture , only the first few energy levels contribute to the spectral weight with true @xmath38 functions ( see fig.([spectral ] ) ) . in order to identify these @xmath38 function contributions we can check whether the quasiparticle weight @xmath325 converge to some _ finite _ value for @xmath202 , whereas if the energy level @xmath189 belongs to the incoherent part @xmath326 remains finite for @xmath264 .",
    "another method to distinguish the coherent part from the incoherent one is to analyze directly the wavefunction components of the eigenstate @xmath327 on the lanczos basis @xmath328 .",

    ", we have a clear evidence of a single quasiparticle weight for @xmath21 not too large , and an incoherent part which is rather similar to the @xmath2 one . for larger @xmath21",
    "the incoherent part moves quite fast to higher energies , leaving probably more than one @xmath38function contributions to the spectral weight .",
    "we then conclude that the inclusion of closed loop paths does not suppress the first quasiparticle weight , but completely washes out all the quasiparticle excitations at higher energies .",
    "even the few peaks that appears in the incoherent part can not be associated to `` string state '' resonances -as suggested by @xcite- but are rather similar to the @xmath2 ones , where localized string states can not exist .",
    "we thus confirm the conclusions of poilblanc.@xcite    as far as the energy spectrum @xmath333 is concerned we obviously found that the lowest energy state has a finite quasiparticle weight and has momentum @xmath334 , instead of @xmath335 as commonly accepted for the @xmath5-@xmath6 model .",
    "@xcite this is because in the @xmath5-@xmath21 model the spin fluctuations are neglected , while they play an important role for the energy dispersion @xmath333 .",
    "finally for the quasiparticle weight as a function of @xmath21 we can apply the same argument at the end of the previous section by assuming that @xmath40 is basically the overlap of an @xmath312 polaron state of size @xmath336 , where @xmath336 may be roughly identified as the correlation length within the string picture @xmath337 .",
    "we should get essential singularities like @xmath338 as in the string picture , where we could not detect the correct @xmath339 behavior for reasonably small values of @xmath21 ( see fig.([stringz ] ) ) , we expect that these kind of singularities are important only at a value of @xmath340 . for larger values of @xmath21 one",
    "obtains a crossover to a @xmath341 behavior surprisingly valid for a quite large range of @xmath21 both in the string picture and in the realistic cases shown in fig .",
    "( [ stringz],[zfit ] ) . in the latter picture",
    "it is also evident that at some small value of @xmath21 the @xmath40 factor should vanish much faster than @xmath341 , otherwise we should get an unplausible critical value of @xmath21 , where the quasiparticle weight vanishes .",
    "this at least supports the behaviour for @xmath40 shown in eq.([zanfitj ] ) .",
    "the accurate determination of the ground state energy in the small @xmath21 region is important to detect a possible transition between a uniform antiferromagnetic state and a state where the hole fully polarize the spins in a finite region of space with size @xmath342 , region being somehow phase - separated from the remaining antiferromagnetic region .",
    "the latter variational state has an energy approaching the nagaoka energy for @xmath343 . at finite @xmath21 , by optimizing the size @xmath336 of the ferromagnetic region , corrections to the asymptotic nagaoka energy scale like @xmath344.@xcite    support for a possible transition comes from the infinite dimension limit@xcite .",
    "in fact the exact evaluation of the green s function , possible in infinite dimension , implies that the lowest energy state contributing to the spectral weight is analytically connected at small @xmath21 not to the nagaoka energy @xmath345 but to the much higher brinkman - rice energy @xmath346 .",
    "if the latter state is identified with the lowest energy state in a uniform antiferromagnetic phase , there should be a critical value @xmath347 where the ` phase separated ' state , discussed at the beginning of this section , becomes lower in energy for @xmath348.@xcite this is essentially the scenario proposed by emery et al .",
    "for the doped @xmath18 model .",
    "we will show in the following a clear numerical evidence that the above scenario _ is not confirmed _ in the @xmath0 model for a single hole , at least in the 2c case .",
    "contrary to the string picture or the infinite dimension limit we see in fig.([grdstex ] ) that the asymptotic value for the energy is clearly given by the nagaoka energy , although the leading corrections to the energy seem quite well fitted by the string picture exponent @xmath341 .",
    "in fact the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian in the lanczos basis describe approximately a linear potential ( fig.([po ] ) ) as in the string picture .",
    "this is obviously important for the small @xmath21 correction to the energy .",
    "moreover in fig.([grdstex ] ) it is shown that the ` phase separated ' state is well above the estimated energies even for very small @xmath21 , leaving a possible transition at an unphysically small value of @xmath349 for the 2c case .",
    "for the 2d case however we do not have enough accuracy as shown in fig.([mh2d ] ) and we can not exclude a transition at @xmath350 .",
    "although we have found evidence that the nagaoka energy is the ground state energy of the @xmath5-@xmath21 model for @xmath1 it is not clear what spin background is favoured in this limit . for instance we could have that the nagaoka state is degenerate in the thermodynamic limit with an antiferromagnetic state .    in order to solve this issue , we have calculated the hole - spin - spin correlation function , by measuring the one involving the spins in the @xmath41-direction @xmath351 and its spin rotation invariant version @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the hole creation operator at origin .",
    "these correlation functions measure how the spin background is perturbed by the hole .",
    "the symmetrized correlation function @xmath354 has been introduced since , for @xmath1 , the total spin is a well defined quantum number and the isotropic hole spin - spin correlation does not depend on the polarization of the total spin .",
    "thus even in the @xmath312 sector a polaron solution with maximum spin leads to a maximum @xmath355 , whereas @xmath356 for this polarized state since the contribution of the parallel spins are exactly cancelled by the one of the antiparallel spins ( all these contributions have the same weight in the polaron solution @xcite ) .",
    "in this way , we can unambiguously distinguish the ferromagnetic region with @xmath357 from the antiferromagnetic one with @xmath358 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ core ] , we have found that for large @xmath21 all the spins are antiferromagnetically correlated in the @xmath41 direction since the two previous correlation functions are almost identical .",
    "there is a clear evidence of an antiferromagnetic correlation which approaches the asymptotic value @xmath359 with a correlation length consistent with the one shown in fig .",
    "( [ wf ] ) .    for small @xmath21 ,",
    "as expected , the finite @xmath106 corrections are important and tends erroneously to enhance the antiferromagnetism ( see fig .",
    "( [ corefit ] ) ) . instead by studying the behavior of @xmath360 and @xmath361 as a function of @xmath270",
    "it is quite clear that the spins are strongly correlated in the @xmath362 plane and for @xmath331 and @xmath2 , the hole - spin - spin correlations seem to approach the fully polarized values @xmath363 and @xmath364 , presumably at any finite distance from the hole .",
    "in conclusion the physical picture of the one hole ground state in the @xmath0 model seems clear .",
    "as we decrease @xmath21 , we approach the nagaoka state with maximum spin and with total @xmath312 ( which is by the way a conserved quantity ) due to the proliferation of closed loop paths that strongly enhance the ferromagnetic correlations around the hole in the @xmath362 plane .",
    "thus there exists a ferromagnetic polaron with a length which diverges for @xmath1 , but that is continuously connected to the antiferromagnetic length obtained at finite large @xmath21 . in this way",
    "the polaron state is somehow similar to the phase separated variational state@xcite , but we have to emphasize that in our approach the localized polaron conserves the translational symmetry because it is defined after the galileo transformation ( [ state ] ) and consequently it is not `` phase separated '' . moreover the total spin projection on the @xmath41-axis vanishes , as it is conserved locally by the effective hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "the energy of this state is much smaller than the `` phase separated '' variational state and represents a more accurate picture of the single hole ground state in the @xmath0 model .",
    "we have presented here a successful attempt to go beyond the retraceable path approximation and the string picture for the hole dynamics in an antiferromagnetic spin background .",
    "a new lanczos - type of analysis of the hamiltonian enabled us to get very accurate results for the 2c problem and qualitatively similar ones for the 2d case . at @xmath2 , a clear dispersion of the main incoherent peak of @xmath365 both for the 2c and",
    "the 2d case was found .",
    "contrary to the prediction of the large spatial dimension we found , at least for the 2c model , that the bottom of the incoherent band is dispersionless and coincides with the nagaoka energy @xmath260 , _",
    "i.e. _ the minimum possible energy by the nagaoka theorem .",
    "this resolve a controversy recently proposed by mller - hartmann and ventura .",
    "in fact , based on the lanczos spectra decoding method , we have given an argument implying that @xmath366 and if for instance @xmath367 , we can easily understand why the infinite dimension limit gets no weight for @xmath368 .",
    "as the dimensionality is increased the tail of the spectral weight below the brinkman - rice energy vanishes exponentially , though remaining always finite up to the nagaoka energy in any finite @xmath37 .    for finite @xmath21 ,",
    "contrary to the string picture , we found only one coherent quasi - particle weight and an incoherent broad spectrum at higher energy .",
    "a second quasiparticle peak may appear in the spectral function but has always a very small weight .",
    "the possibility of a phase transition as a function of @xmath21 is not compatible with our numerical results for the ground state energy , unless for very small coupling constant , and consequently , the emery s argument about the phase separation for small @xmath6 is found unlikely in the @xmath5-@xmath21 model .",
    "the spin charge decoupling for a single hole is surely not evident for short distance propagations .",
    "however , it still remains open whether the spin charge decoupling happens asymptotically at large distance , although for the 2c case we have ruled out this possibility up to a distance of about 10 lattice spacings .",

    "<S> we review in details a recently proposed technique to extract information about dynamical correlation functions of many - body hamiltonians with a few lanczos iterations and without the limitation of finite size . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this technique to understand the low energy properties and the dynamical spectral weight of a simple model describing the motion of a single hole in a quantum antiferromagnet : the @xmath0 model in two spatial dimension and for a double chain lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of the model allows us a well controlled numerical solution , especially for the two chain case . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous approximations we have found that the single hole ground state in the infinite system is continuously connected with the nagaoka fully polarized state for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> analogously we have obtained an accurate determination of the dynamical spectral weight relevant for photoemission experiments . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> an argument is given that the spectral weight vanishes at the nagaoka energy faster than any power law , as supported also by a clear numerical evidence . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that spin charge decoupling is an exact property for a single hole in the bethe lattice but does not apply to the more realistic lattices where the hole can describe closed loop paths . </S>"
