    "the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite is plagued by infrared renormalons .",
    "the origin of this problem lies in the fact that we perturb around an instable ( zero ) vacuum .",
    "a remedy would be the mass generation of the particles , connected to a non - perturbative , lower value of the vacuum energy .",
    "such a dynamical mass must be of a non - perturbative nature , since the gn lagrangian possesses a discrete chiral symmetry . a dynamical mass is closely related to a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for a local composite operator @xmath1 .",

    "we consider gn because the exact mass gap @xcite and vacuum energy @xcite are known .",

    "another possible problem is vacuum energy renormalization .",
    "perturbatively , the vacuum energy is zero and hence no vacuum energy renormalization is needed .",
    "non - perturbatively , we expect logarithmic divergences proportional to @xmath35 for @xmath25 .",

    ". we already pointed out why we probably did nt find an optimal @xmath6 with our method .",
    "the best we can do with this special @xmath2 value , is just choosing a ( physical ) renormalization scheme , but we must realize we can easily obtain highly over- or underestimated values in this case and that this is not a self - consistent way to obtain results .",
    "this paper , which had the purpose to investigate the dynamical mass generation and non - perturbative vacuum energy of the two - dimensional gross - neveu field theory , consisted of two main parts . in the first part",
    ", we proved how all bubble feynman diagrams can be consistently resummed up to all orders in an effective mass @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath17 is given by the sum of the @xmath0 vacuum bubbles , calculated with the @xmath0 massive propagator ( i.e. with mass @xmath21 ) , plus an extra term , accounting for a double counting ambiguity .",
    "+   + we showed that the @xmath0 expansion can be renormalized with the original counterterms of the model .",
    "+   + a very important fact is that the @xmath0 expansion for @xmath17 is only correct if the gap equation @xmath132 is fulfilled . in this context",
    ", we discussed the renormalization group equation for @xmath17 , and showed why @xmath17 does nt obey its rge _",
    "order by order _ , because the requirement of the gap equation turns terms of different orders into the same order .",
    "we stress that this does not mean @xmath17 does nt obey its rge , or ask for the introduction of a `` non - perturbative '' @xmath133-function .",
    "+   + to get actual values for @xmath107 and @xmath17 , we employed the @xmath3 scheme , and after the classical choice @xmath94 to cancel logarithms , we recovered the @xmath4 results .",
    "however , the corresponding coupling constant was infinite , so we could nt say anything about validity of the results , without the foreknowledge of exact values .",
    "this , combined with the uselessness of the rge for @xmath17 to improve calculations , compelled us to search for a more sophisticated way to improve the @xmath0 technique .",
    "+   + in the second part , we first eliminated the freedom in the renormalization of the @xmath0 mass parameter , by transforming @xmath21 to a renormalization scheme and scale independent @xmath5 .",
    "the consistency relation @xmath131 was completely equivalent to @xmath109 .",
    "secondly , we parametrized the coupling constant renormalization . after a reorganization of the series",
    ", all scheme dependence was reduced to a single parameter @xmath6 , equivalent to the choice of a certain scale parameter @xmath134 .",
    "+ we fixed this @xmath6 by means of the principe of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) .",
    "originally , pms was founded on the logical requirement that observable physics can not depend on how one chooses to renormalize . translated to our case , @xmath17 and @xmath107 should nt depend on the arbitrary parameter @xmath6 .",
    "but we showed on theoretical grounds why applying pms on neither @xmath107 nor @xmath17 would be valid , because analogously as @xmath17 ( @xmath107 ) does nt lose its scale dependence order by order , it does nt lose its scheme dependence order by order .",
    "+   + nevertheless , we gave an outcome to the problem of pms . by construction , @xmath5 is scheme and scale independent , so we can apply pms on this mass parameter .",
    "this provides us with an optimal @xmath6 to calculate @xmath5 , and consequently @xmath17 and @xmath107 . for the scale @xmath93",
    ", we made 2 reasonable choices .",
    "these 2 choices gave acceptable results at first order , yet there was quite a big difference between them .",
    "the second order results were comparable and qualitatively good , converging to the exact values for growing @xmath2 .",
    "+   + the relevant expansion parameter was relatively small .",
    "we gave extra evidence why results were good , by using a fastest apparent convergence argument .",
    "+   + we explicitly checked that using pms on @xmath17 and @xmath107 to fix @xmath6 gave worse results , and the convergence was very slow .",
    "+   + summarizing , we have constructed a self consistent method to calculate the mass gap and non - perturbative vacuum energy .",
