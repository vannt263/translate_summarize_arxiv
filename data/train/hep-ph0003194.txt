    "the karmen collaboration has reported a distortion in the time distribution of their events @xcite .",
    "the experiment studies low energy neutrinos produced by the dump of @xmath1 mev protons at the isis facility of the rutherford laboratory .",
    "the accelarator has a unique time structure which allows to discriminate between neutrinos coming from @xmath2 decaying at rest and from the subsequent @xmath3 decay at rest .",
    "it is in this last process that an anomaly was observed in the time distribution of interactions , which overall reproduces the lifetime of the muon but for an excess of events at a time delay centered on @xmath4s w.r.t .",
    "the arrival of the protons .",
    "the signature is a deposition of energy in the range 11 to 35 mev .",
    "+ this is interpreted by the karmen collaborators as possibly coming from the production of a heavy neutral object @xmath5 of mass 33.9 mev , travelling with a @xmath6 of @xmath7 and decaying in the detector , @xmath8 away from the dump . the @xmath5 particle is produced in @xmath2 decays : @xmath9 with a very small branching ratio and decays in turn into the _ a priori _ open channels : @xmath10 or @xmath11 or @xmath12 + the karmen experiment finds about 100 events compatible with @xmath5 production and decay in a sample of 3000 neutrino interactions .",
    "this is a more than 4 @xmath13 effect .",
    "+ experimentaly , there are two unknowns in the problem : the branching fraction @xmath14 of @xmath2 s decaying into the @xmath5 particle and the lifetime @xmath15 of the latter . in order to reproduce the observed number of events , @xmath14 and @xmath15 must be related by the curve shown in fig.1 as given in @xcite . for long lifetimes ,",
    "the probability of decay in the detector is inversely proportionnal to the lifetime . for shorter lifetimes ,",
    "a good fraction of @xmath5 s has decayed before reaching the detector .",
    "observe that , for very short @xmath15 , the distribution of excess events in the detector should be uneven because of the stronger probability to decay close to the upper end .",
    "taking this into account would change the shape of the curve in the low @xmath15 region .",
    "however , karmen sees no such effect , which can be taken as an indication that of the two possible @xmath15 values corresponding to a given @xmath14 , only the higher one must be considered . + a direct search for @xmath5 production in @xmath16 decay by looking at the muon spectrum was performed at psi @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it excludes branching fractions larger than @xmath17 , as also indicated in fig .",
    "massive neutrinos , arising , for example , from the introduction of right - handed chiral states , occur naturally in most extensions of the standard model .",
    "they have been searched through their decays in various experiments @xcite +      if massive neutrinos exist , the so - called weak eigenstates ( associated to charged leptons via weak currents ) which we will call generically @xmath18 , are linear combinations of mass eigenstates @xmath19 .",
    "let us call @xmath20 the coefficient of @xmath19 in the expansion of @xmath18 ( @xmath21 being @xmath22 or @xmath3 for the production processes envisionned here ) .",
    "in any @xmath18 neutrino beam , there is a @xmath19 component at the @xmath23 level up to phase space factors and weak currents matrix elements .",
    "+ for example , @xmath0 decays may yield @xmath19 at the level @xmath24 up to the above mentionned factors , provided that @xmath19 has a mass below @xmath25 mev , while @xmath16 decays would produce @xmath19 at the level @xmath26 with masses up to @xmath27 mev . + note that the well known chirality suppression of @xmath0 no longer occurs as soon as @xmath28 a few mev .",
    "+ for the @xmath5 particle , @xmath29 and the mixing discussed in fig 1 is @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 is supposed to be at the limit of the available phase - space in @xmath16 ( in order to ensure @xmath32 ) , one would expect it to be produced more abundantly in @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio of the branching ratios @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 for massless @xmath36 s .",
    "however , this is very sensitive to the precise value of @xmath37 .",
    "several decay modes can be investigated .",
    "heavy neutrinos with masses below @xmath38 mev can only decay radiatively by emitting one or two photons .",
    "as soon as the mass is above @xmath38 mev , the most favoured decay mode is @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix element is analogous to that of muon decay and the width is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 tends rapidly to @xmath42 for masses above @xmath43 mev ( @xcite ) and @xmath44 is the same mixing which appears at production if @xmath19 is produced together with an electron .",
    "+ for higher masses , other decay channels open : @xmath45 each one involving a mixing matrix element which depends on the final state leptons .",
    "the @xmath5 particle could be such a massive neutrino undergoing weak decays .",
    "however for a @xmath47 mev object @xmath48 is the only open non - radiative channel and its width , far above those of the radiative modes , dominates the lifetime .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath49 has been obtained @xcite for such a mass .",
    "this translates into a limit @xmath50 which is reported in fig . 1 and excludes most of the allowed parameter region .",
    "for the highest mass eigenstate , published limits on @xmath51 ( @xcite ) allow to infer @xmath52 and @xmath53 + moreover , taking the experimental karmen curve ( see fig .",
    "1 ) into account , this implies + @xmath54 which is barely compatible with the upper limits from the two psi groups who tried a direct @xmath5 search @xcite , @xcite ) figures which are really limits on the branching ratio . since , on the other hand , the way the psi groups compute their upper bounds does not yield the tightest possible result ,",
    "their is ample room for argument , and very little room , if any , for @xmath5 ] + an alternative interpretation has been proposed @xcite in terms of exotic muon decays .",
    "it involves unknown scalars .",
    "we study here yet another possibility , which implies an ordinary massive neutrino , call it @xmath46 .",
    "+ as already remarked , many channels open as soon as phase - space permits .",
    "if we assume a @xmath0 production mode , masses up to @xmath56 mev are possible , and @xmath57 decays are allowed for sufficiently high @xmath58 , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "2 . for such modes ,",
    "the time delay between beam on target and the events in excess in the karmen detector would be the sum of the final state muon lifetime with the time necessary for @xmath46 to fly from the proton target to the detector .",
    "indeed , the kinetic energy of @xmath59 is small and that of @xmath60 may fall short of the karmen detection energy threshold , depending on @xmath58 , rendering it necessary to wait for the muon to decay . at rest , one finds @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 mev . ]",
    "+ this would yield an average ( electron ) energy around @xmath63 mev after an average delay of @xmath64 following the undetected @xmath46 decay .",
    "+ the karmen anomalous events appear to be rather tightly clustered in time if they are interpreted in the lines of @xcite and their apparent dispersion can not be understood as due to a muon decay .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite show that a rather narrow bump can be interpreted as the superposition of two exponentials , both with the same ( muon ) decay time constant , but with the second shifted by a more or less fixed amount representing a time of flight .",
    "+      therefore , we have tried to perform a two component fit to the karmen time distribution .",
    "the first component is an exponential reflecting ordinary muon decay in the target followed by practically instantaneous interaction of the normal light neutrinos thus produced in the detector ( the tof is about 60 ns ) + the second component is the convolution of a uniform and an exponential distribution representing the sum of the transit time of a heavy neutrino from the target to the detector ( which is also the heavy neutrino lifetime in the lab and is practically uniform in the window of interest ) plus the lifetime of the muon produced in the heavy neutrino decay .",
    "+ however , this turned out to be inconsistent .",
    "the fitted tof of the heavy neutrinos implies a mass close to @xmath65 mev which in turn means a positron energy distribution ( in @xmath66 ) rather evenly distributed around an expectation value of @xmath67 mev , thereby invalidating the hypothesis that the delay would always comprise the @xmath3 lifetime .",
    "it was therefore necessary to add a third component representing those direct positrons .",
    "thus , there are altogether 5 parameters representing the intensities of the three components and the lower and upper limits of the time window corresponding to the passage of the @xmath46 s in the karmen detector .",
    "+ in principle , this gives us a potential consistency check of the fact that the anomaly is really due to a particle since its speed can be estimated from the last two parameters using the average distance between the proton target and the detector on the one hand , and the length of the latter on the other hand .",
    "however , the data at our disposal are not accurate enough to decide between different fit results which do or do not conform with this expectation . given the large errors on the fitted parameters , the results presented on fig .",
    "3 can not be considered as inconsistent with the expectation .",
    "+ here , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the lower and upper edges of the time window , and the three following items are constants multiplying the three normalized distributions superposed in the fit",
    ". since the bin width is @xmath70 , the corresponding number of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are about @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "+ the fit yields : tof @xmath75 , hence @xmath76 and @xmath77 mev .",
    "+      it must be remarked now that for an ordinary heavy dirac neutrino , there are really two ( non mutually exclusive ) possibilities : + - either it decays to @xmath78 and a virtual @xmath79 which yields @xmath80 + - or it decays to @xmath81 and the virtual boson goes into @xmath82 .",
    "+ the first possibility involves the same mixing matrix element , namely @xmath83 , which appears at production , whilst in the second case , the decay is due to @xmath84 + clearly enough , in any case @xmath85 and the @xmath48 mode is also widely open . if we assume the first channel , the unknown mixing cancels in the ratio of the two modes which is given by the following formula:@xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the width ratio is about @xmath89 for @xmath90 mev . +",
    "this shows two things : first , for the range of masses of interest , the lifetime is dominated by the @xmath48 mode , which gives us another relation between @xmath44 and @xmath15 and allows to draw further conclusions .",
    "second , decays through this mode must have occured abundantly in the karmen experiment , but the corresponding ( large ) deposition of energy is probably rejected by the karmen selection .",
    "+ the results of this analysis are summarized on fig .",
    "4 it reproduces the karmen efficiency curve corrected for the @xmath2 decay mode considered here ( the unknown constant was taken from the asymptotic direction of the karmen plot @xcite ) ; also drawn is the branch of hyperbola corresponding to the @xmath91 value fixed by the @xmath46 mass and the hypothesis of an @xmath92 dominated @xmath46 lifetime . the latter is found to be @xmath93 and the @xmath94 branching ratio is around @xmath95 this entails a mixing matrix element @xmath96 compatible with the previously published upper limits @xcite + here again , this object should be much more abundantly produced in kaon decays .",
    "the ratio of ratios is around @xmath97 in this case .",
    "+ of course , we do not claim that this is `` the '' solution , but only wish to point out another possibility .",
    "it could probably be easily disproved through confrontation with more detailed karmen data .",
    "in short , the karmen collaboration have chosen to explain their anomalous events by assuming they originate from a rare @xmath16 decay , because a neutrino with a mass at the edge of phase - space ( around @xmath98 mev ) has both a low enough velocity to explain the @xmath99 delay and a low enough mass to explain the @xmath100 mev energy deposition .",
    "we claim that both features can be explained by a @xmath0 decay yielding a much heavier neutrino which decays itself through a @xmath101 channel , the signature of which is a visible energy in the range of interest after the ( apparently ) observed delay .",
    "the more mundane @xmath102 channel is supposedly hidden by the experimental energy cut off and the apparent clustering in time due to a fixed time of flight followed by a short detectability window is not spoiled upon taking the muon lifetime into account .",
