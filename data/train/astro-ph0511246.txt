    "the observation of gravitationally redshifted atomic absorption lines from the surface of the neutron star ( ns ) in exo 0748 - 676 ( cottam , paerels & mendez 2002 ; hereafter cpm ) provides a new constraint on the nuclear equation of state . by adding spectra of 28 type i x - ray bursts observed with xmm - newton , cpm detected an absorption line at 13   during the peak of the burst , which moved to 13.75   as the surface temperature declined .",
    "they associated these features with hydrogen - like and helium - like fe @xmath3 transitions , implying a gravitational redshift of @xmath4 .",
    "motivated by these observations , bildsten , chang & paerels ( 2003 ; hereafter bcp ) explained why fe can be present above the photosphere .",
    "they also discussed the microphysics of the resonant fe h@xmath0 line , showing that it is stark broadened because of the large photospheric densities , @xmath5 ( paerels 1997 ) and confirmed london , taam & howard s ( 1986 ) conclusion that the radiation field determines the fe ionization balance .",
    "chang , bildsten & wasserman ( 2005 , hereafter cbw ) recently amplified these points and performed a self - consistent radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium calculation .",
    "they assumed that the fe h@xmath0 line forming region is a thin layer above the continuum photosphere , as expected from bcp s accretion - spallation scenario . the h@xmath0 line is a scattering dominated resonance line with a fine structure splitting of 20.7 ev comparable to the observed width and the scale of rotational broadening for a 10 km ns rotating at 45 hz of 24 ev .",
    "the lack of pulsations from this ns during accretion leads us to estimate that @xmath6 needed for zeeman splitting to play a role in the formation of the fe h@xmath0 line ( loeb 2003 ) .",
    "cbw calculated the equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of fe column , @xmath7 , for varying effective temperatures and pressures in the thin line - forming region . to match the observed ew required ,",
    "a total iron column of @xmath8 was needed , higher than predicted by bcp by a factor of a few .    in this letter",
    ", we rotationally broaden the energy and angle dependent line profiles of cbw and compare them to the observations .",
    "we explain our method of calculating the rotational broadening in  2 and show that the schwarzschild+doppler ( s+d ) approximation ( miller & lamb 1998 ; braje , romani , & rauch 2000 ) is extremely accurate in reproducing the line profiles from the full general relativistic calculation , even up to 300 hz .",
    "we fit the data in  3 and show that the intrinsically broad line profile prohibits any meaningful constraint on the ns radius if the 44.7 hz burst oscillation seen by villarreal & strohmayer ( 2004 ) is the spin frequency . at slow spins or at low inclinations , the line profile shape is set by both rotational broadening and fine structure splitting , making it absolutely necessary to use realistic line profiles when modeling the lines in  or any other favorably oriented ( and hence detectable ) rapidly rotating ns .",
    "we confirm the importance of the intrinsic line profile in determining ns parameters by constrasting it with a simple line profile .",
    "we close  3 by accurately determining the redshift and the amount of fe in the upper atmosphere .",
    "we conclude in  4 by summarizing our findings and discussing the likelihood that lines like that seen in  will be found in the more rapidly rotating nss .",
    "we compute the impact of rotational broadening on cbw s intrinsic line profiles using two independent methods : a fully relativistic method that employs ray - tracing in the spacetime of a rotating ns and an approximate method which retains the most important relativistic effects to lowest order in @xmath9 .    in the fully relativistic approach ,",
    "the spacetime metric for rotating nss with various spin frequencies , masses and equations of state are computed numerically as described in cadeau , leahy & morsink ( 2005a ) .",
    "once the ( non - spherical ) surface of the ns has been located , geodesics connecting the surface to the observer are computed .",
    "we discretize the surface into small patches and calculate the zenith angle @xmath0 between the local normal and initial photon direction in the locally comoving frame for each patch .",
    "we also calculate the solid angle @xmath10 subtended by the patch as seen by the observer and the redshift @xmath11 .",
    "the redshift , @xmath11 includes both the gravitational redshift and doppler - like terms resulting from rotation .",
    "since the intensity , @xmath12 , is both a function of energy and @xmath13 , the observed flux due to the patch is @xmath14 the observed spectrum is found by summing over all visible patches .",
    "the technical details of the fully relativistic computational method are presented by cadeau et  al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "we also use the simpler s+d approximation ( miller & lamb 1998 ; braje , romani , & rauch 2000 ; also see cadeau et al 2005a and poutanen & gierlinski 2003 ) to independently compute the spectrum . in the s+d approximation",
    "the metric is approximated by the non - rotating schwarzschild metric , and appropriate doppler factors correct for the rotation .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath9 , the redshift factor reduces to @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the scale of rotational broadening , @xmath18 is the observed spin of the ns , and @xmath19 .",
    "the angle @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle of the emitting patch about the vector pointing from the center of the star towards the observer .",
    "this angle is zero if the patch is in the plane defined by the spin axis and this vector .",
    "a further simplification is the use of the beloborodov ( 2002 ) approximation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bending angle .",
    "this allows the total observed flux to be written as the integral over all possible initial photon zenith and azimuthal angles , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ns radius and @xmath25 is the distance .",
    "the results for emission from the entire ns surface with cbw s intrinsic line profile of the fully relativistic calculation and the s+d approximation are shown in figure [ fig : sharon ] .",
    "they are in excellent agreement and the tiny deviations are mainly due to our neglect of relativistic aberation .",
    "the linear change to the metric in @xmath9 due to frame dragging ( hartle 1967 , hartle & thorne 1968 ) suggests observable effect on the line at spin frequencies near 300 hz as @xmath26 .",
    "however , the frame - dragging term enters into the line broadening calculation as a second order effect in @xmath9 , preserving the validity of the simple s+d approximation . only at very high spin frequencies",
    "does frame dragging have the potential of producing observable effects ( bhattacharyya et al 2004 ) .    of greater relevance",
    "is the relative size of the fine structure splitting and the scale of rotational broadening . at 45 hz",
    ", the scale of rotational broadening is 24 ev for a 10 km ns , which is similar to the fine structure splitting of 20.7 ev for the fe h@xmath0 line . at slower and faster rotation rates , fine structure splitting dominates rotational",
    "broadening and vice versa .",
    "hence the line profile can change dramatically near 45 hz .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure [ fig : sharon ] where we plot the line profile for @xmath27 hz ( long - short dashed line ) , which is dominated by fine structure splitting .",
    "the simplicity and accuracy of the s+d approximation allows for a rapid and detailed exploration of parameter space . we assume emission from the entire surface .",
    "emission concentrated near the spin axis would also give narrow line profiles ( bhattacharyya , miller & lamb 2004 ) , but we do not consider this possibility .",
    "we fit our models to the co - added spectra and continuum model from cpm .",
    "we focus on a narrow range between 12  and 14  and plot these points in figure [ fig : fitspectra ] .",
    "the 13.25   feature in the continuum fit is due to a ne ix resonant transition in the circumstellar model . taking the continuum model as the background flux , we overlay some models for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , 100 and 300 hz for @xmath30 km . to set the scale of stark broadening , we take a background density of @xmath31 , which is appropriate for a uniform fe abundance above the continuum photosphere ( cbw ) . from these models ,",
    "large spins i.e. @xmath32 hz are ruled out . secondly , the intrinsically broad line profile which is similar to the width of the observed line , prohibits a meaningful limit on @xmath24 for @xmath33 hz .",
    "we also performed a detailed exploration of parameter space . using the data between 12.6   and 13.3 ",
    ", we overlay our line profiles on the continuum model to test the goodness of fit .",
    "varying @xmath34 , 1+z , and @xmath35 , the best fit gives a @xmath36 for 17 degrees of freedom . by itself",
    ", the continuum model gives @xmath37 .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the errors indicated are one sigma values derived from the covariance matrix .    to develop a more detailed understanding of parameter space ,",
    "we marginalize our three parameter joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) over two parameters at a time and plot the resulting one dimensional pdf for each parameter in figure [ fig : likelihood ] .",
    "the 68% , 95% , and 99% central confidence intervals for the intrinsic line profiles for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for @xmath43 ) are @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) respectively . for the best measured value of @xmath50 , a 1.4 @xmath51  ns with r = 9.2",
    "km falls within these limits .",
    "the pdf for @xmath52 is asymmetric toward zero and hence prohibits setting a meaningful lower limit due to the instrinsic width of the line set by its fine structure .",
    "had we ignored the instrinic shape of the line and had adopted a black line profile , which is a narrow line with zero flux about line center and fixed ew = 0.1   ( dashed line ) , we would set misleading constraints on the neutron star parameters . using this black line profile",
    ", we can constrain @xmath53 hz which for a 44.7 hz rotator gives @xmath54 km . these misleading constraints",
    "highlight the importance of using the intrinsic line profile to fit for ns parameters",
    ". the limitations of simple line profiles have also been recognized previously by villarreal & strohmayer ( 2004 ) .",
    "the 68% , 95% and 99% central confidence intervals of @xmath55 are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath7 s are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . at 68% confidence ,",
    "these values are within a factor of 3 - 6 times the solar metallicity photospheric value , @xmath62 ( cbw ) and within a factor of 5 - 10 times the accretion - spallation value of @xmath63 ( bcp ) . at 99% confidence",
    ", we may require a column a factor of up to 10 times larger .",
    "our estimate from this likelihood analysis agrees with cbw s simple ew estimate .",
    "in addition the nlte value of @xmath7 is likely larger ( london , taam & howard 1986 ) and may demand either supersolar metallicity or radiative levitation ( cbw ) .",
    "the 68% , 95% and 99% central confidence intervals of @xmath64 are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we have also calculated the corresponding confidence intervals for @xmath68 which gives @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "since we fit a rotationally broadened profile to the data , our measurement of @xmath64 is immune to beaming effects which ozel & psaltis ( 2003 ) ( also see bhattacharyya , miller & lamb 2004 ) point out can skew the measurement of the redshift if the line energy is taken from flux minimum ( or combinations of minima ) .",
    "using the intrinsic fe h@xmath0 line profiles calculated by cbw , we calculate rotational broadened line profiles to compare to the observed lines in  ( cpm ) .",
    "we show that the line profiles generated by the simple s+d approximation accurately reproduces the ones from a fully relativistic ray tracing method described briefly in   2 .",
    "assuming that the burst emission comes from the entire surface of the ns , we constrain the fe column in the line forming region ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we also find that the redshift is @xmath73 .",
    "the ns spin is @xmath74 for a fiducial ns radius of @xmath75 km .",
    "these errors denote 95% confidence intervals .",
    "fixing @xmath33 hz ( villarreal & strohmayer 2004 ) , we find that the radius is effectively unconstrained by the observed line due to the intrinsic width set by fine structure splitting , an effect missed by simple line profiles .",
    "other transitions would simultaneously confirm the redshift measurement and may provide meaningful constraints on the radius .",
    "cbw calculated the line profiles for the associate ly@xmath0 transition and p@xmath0 transition .",
    "the ews of the fe ly@xmath0 and p@xmath0 lines were @xmath76 ev and @xmath77 ev , respectively .",
    "the p@xmath0 transition is obscured by interstellar absorption .",
    "cbw points out that the ly@xmath0 line profile is dominated by rotational broadening .",
    "hence a sufficiently deep observation of the ly@xmath0 transition would provide a good constraint on the radius of exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "the helium - like fe @xmath3 may provide some additional constraints on exo 0748 - 676 , but the intrinsic line profile is not known .",
    "this is critical in modeling this feature , but is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "spectral modeling of the continuum emission during type i x - ray burst has also been utilized to determine ns parameters ( shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2004 ; shaposhnikov , titarchuk , & haberl 2003 and references therein ) . redshift measurements and spectral modeling utilized in combination would set very tight constraints on ns parameters .",
    "though exo 0748 - 676 is rotating slowly among lmxbs , more rapid rotation does not necessarily make spectral lines undetectable .",
    "if a rapidly rotating ns is viewed more face on , the spectral lines will be narrower .",
    "hence , more rapid rotators may just constitute a smaller population of nss with detectable features .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : detection ] where we plot the percentage of sky denoted by @xmath78 over which the line minimum exceeds 10% and 30% below the continuum .",
    "we assume the same intrinsic line profile as the observed h@xmath0 line on exo 0748 - 676 for a ns @xmath79 of 10 , 15 and 20 km .",
    "we use @xmath79 instead of @xmath24 because @xmath79 is a convenient way of absorbing the factor of @xmath80 in the scale of broadening , @xmath81 .",
    "these lines follow a very simple trend , which we now derive . up to a certain rotation rate , these lines are always detectable . for sufficiently large rotation rates , the fwhm of the line is @xmath82 .",
    "since the ew is conserved , the line minimum is @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , maximum inclination for line minima greater than a certain strength is @xmath84 , which limits the fraction of sky over which this line would be detectable .",
    "hence , the larger effect of rotational broadening with higher inclination broadens the line and weakens line minima unless emission is restricted to the rotational pole ( ozel & psaltis 2003 ; bhattacharyya , miller , & lamb 2004 ) .    for a fiducial value of @xmath85 km",
    ", 10 - 20% of ns with spins of 300 hz would have spectral features similar to exo 0748 - 676 where the line minimum is about 30% below the continuum .",
    "at 600 hz , the percentage is reduced by a factor of two . for these favorably spinning and oriented nss ( line minimum @xmath86% ) , the line profile is set by both rotational broadening and fine structure splitting .",
    "therefore , burst studies of nss with spins near 300 hz may yield at least another example of atomic spectral lines from nss . for these most favorable systems ,",
    "the intrinsic line profile is absolutely necessary in order to model these lines and perform meaningful measurements from the observations . of the presently known lmxbs with x - ray bursts ,",
    "a very promising target is 4u 1728 - 34 which spins at 363 hz ( galloway et al 2003 ) and exhibits bursts at a fairly regular rate . a recent model of the ns - accretion disk geometry ( shaposhnikov et al .",
    "2003 ) estimates @xmath87 to be around 50@xmath88 . at this inclination",
    ", the line minimum is 7% below the continuum . for smaller inclinations of @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ", the line minimum would be 10% and 26% respectively .",
