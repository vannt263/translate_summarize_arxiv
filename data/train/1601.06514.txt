    "is important in various experimental domains , such as material analysis applications , astrophysics , photon science and bio - medical physics .",
    "as one of the interactions photons undergo in matter , it is relevant in experimental methods concerned with the energy deposition resulting from photons as primary or secondary particles .",
    "photoionization is also experimentally relevant for the secondary atomic processes that it induces , x - ray fluorescence and auger electron emission , which play a role in many physics research areas and technological applications .",
    "extensive reviews , which cover both the theoretical and experimental aspects of this process , can be found in the literature : @xcite are some notable examples among them .",
    "this paper is concerned with modeling the physics of photoionization in a pragmatic way : the simulation of this process in general purpose monte carlo codes for particle transport .",
    "calculations for the simulation of the photoelectric effect are implemented in these codes @xcite , nevertheless a comprehensive , quantitative appraisal of their validity is not yet documented in the literature .",
    "assessments previously reported in the literature concern comparisons of cross sections with nist reference values , such as @xcite , or comparisons of cross section libraries used in monte carlo codes @xcite , or involve complex observables resulting from several physics processes in the full simulation of an experimental set - up , such as @xcite . comparisons with experimental data of basic modeling features of photoionization in monte carlo codes , such as those shown in @xcite , are usually limited to qualitative visual appraisal and to a restricted sample of photon energies and target materials .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the validation of simulation models implies their comparison with experimental measurements @xcite ; comparisons with tabulations of theoretical calculations or analytical parameterizations , such as those reported in @xcite as validation of geant4 photon interaction cross sections , do not constitute a validation of the simulation software .",
    "the analysis documented here evaluates the methods adopted in widely known monte carlo systems for the calculation of photoelectric cross sections for the elements of the periodic table , as well as other modeling approaches not yet implemented in these codes .",
    "this investigation aims to assess the capabilities of monte carlo codes for particle transport in this respect , and identify the state of the art for the simulation of the photoelectric effect .",
    "special emphasis is devoted to the validation and possible improvement of photoionization simulation in geant4 @xcite ; nevertheless , the results documented in this paper provide information relevant to other monte carlo systems as well .",
    "the simulation of the atomic relaxation following the ionization of an atom has been treated in previous publications @xcite , therefore it is not addressed in this paper .",
    "this study concerns an extensive set of models for the simulation of photoionization , which are representative of the variety of theoretical and empirical methods documented in the literature .",
    "the validation test concerns single ionisation of neutral atoms by non - polarized photons , as this is the context handled by general purpose monte carlo codes .",
    "computational performance imposes constraints on the complexity of physics calculations to be performed in the course of simulation ; hence the analysis in this paper is limited to theoretical cross sections for which tabulations of pre - calculated values are available and to empirical models that are expressed by means of simple analytical formulations . to be relevant for general purpose monte carlo systems",
    ", tabulated data should cover the whole periodic table of elements and an extended energy range .",
    "the evaluation mainly concerns total and partial photoelectric cross sections : in particle transport , the former are relevant to determine the occurrence of the photoionization process , while the latter determine which shell is ionized .",
    "calculated cross sections are quantitatively compared with a wide set of experimental data collected from the literature .",
    "the compatibility with experiment for each model , and the differences in compatibility with experiment across the various models , are quantified by means of statistical methods .",
    "in addition , methods for the determination of the photoelectron angular distribution are examined ; nevertheless , due to the scarcity of pertinent experimental data , their analysis is limited to qualitative considerations .",
    "computational algorithms pertaining to how basic physics modeling features are used in the transport environment , such as methods for dealing with the macroscopic cross sections for compounds or mixtures @xcite , are outside the scope of this paper .",
    "photoionization has been the object of theoretical and experimental interest for several decades ; only a brief overview of the physics relevant to the simulation of the photoelectric effect in general purpose monte carlo codes is included here to facilitate the understanding of the validation tests reported in this paper .    in the photoelectric effect",
    "a photon disappears and an electron is ejected from an atom .",
    "the energy of the photoelectron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the absorbed photon and the energy binding the electron to the atom .",
    "general purpose monte carlo codes for particle transport consider single photon interactions with isolated atoms in their ground state ; they neglect interactions with ions and excited states , and multiple ionizations .",
    "photon interactions are treated regardless of the environment of the target medium ; this assumption neglects solid state effects and other features related to the molecular structure of the medium .",
    "the environment can have a significant effect on the cross sections near the photoionization thresholds of both inner and outer shell electrons ; due to the limitations of their underlying physics assumptions , current general purpose monte carlo codes are not usually exploited for the simulation of experimental scenarios involving exafs ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) , xanes ( x - ray absorption near edge structure ) and other techniques for which detailed accounting of material structure is required .      the photoelectric cross section as a function of energy exhibits a characteristic sawtooth behavior corresponding to absorption edges , as the binding energy of each electron subshell is attained and corresponding photoionization is allowed to occur .",
    "early theoretical calculations of photoionization cross sections were limited to the k shell ; they are represented by the papers of pratt @xcite , providing the asymptotic behavior for arbitrarily high energies , and pratt et al .",
    "@xcite , reporting calculations in the energy range between 200  kev and 2  mev .",
    "more extensive calculations became available only at a later stage : rakavy and ron @xcite calculated cross sections for all subshells of five elements over the energy range 1  kev to 2  mev , and schmickley and pratt @xcite reported cross sections for k to m shells for three elements from 412 to 1332  kev .",
    "scofield s non - relativistic calculations @xcite in a hartree - slater framework represented a major advancement in the field , as they covered systematically all subshells over the whole periodic table of the elements .",
    "more recent calculations were performed by chantler @xcite in a self - consistent relativistic dirac - hartree - fock framework .",
    "these theoretical calculations provide the basis for the tabulated data libraries listed in section [ sec_compilations ] .",
    "various empirical formulations of photoionization cross sections are reported in the literature , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "they derive from fits to experimental data , parameterizations of theoretical calculations and semi - empirical methods involving both measured data and theoretical considerations .",
    "fischer s non - relativistic theory @xcite addresses the calculation of differential cross sections in the low energy region .",
    "the first relativistic treatment of the photoelectric effect was given by sauter @xcite , who calculated the k - shell cross section in the born approximation ; it concerns the lowest order in z@xmath0 ( where z is the atomic number of the target , @xmath1 is the fine structure constant and @xmath2 is @xmath3 ) .",
    "a comparison of these theories is discussed in @xcite , which showed that sauter s theory applies even in the non - relativistic realm , despite being derived for relativistic electrons .",
    "gavrila @xcite and nagel @xcite extended sauter s results to the next order in z@xmath0 .",
    "further calculations by gavrila are available for the l shell @xcite .",
    "monte carlo codes generate the photoelectron angular distribution based on these differential cross section calculations ; their respective approaches are documented in section [ sec_mc ] .",
    "the photoelectric cross section compilations considered in this study are listed in table  [ tab_models ] , which reports the label by which they are identified in the validation analysis , the corresponding references and their coverage in energy , atomic number and atomic shells .",
    "a brief overview of their features is summarized in the following subsections , where the compilations appear in chronological order of publication ; more details can be found the related references .",

    "nevertheless , no conclusions regarding the capabilities of the cross section models at lower energies can be inferred from such a limited test ; the failure over a single experimental data set could be due either to deficiency of the models or to systematic effects affecting the measurements , which can not be investigated in terms of consistency with other , independent experimental measurements .",
    "the cross sections for outer shells appear incompatible with experiment ; the @xmath4 test rejects the hypothesis of compatibility between calculated and experimental cross sections in most test cases .",
    "nevertheless , caution should be exercised in drawing general conclusions from these results , as the experimental data sample for the validation of outer shells is small and for a given test case the available data often originate from a single experimental source .",
    "this test scenario is prone to be affected by systematic effects , which would hinder the reliability of the outcome of the statistical analysis .",

    "inconsistencies in the analytical formula of the latter appearing in the software documentation have been corrected in the implementation used for this evaluation .",
    "reports of direct measurements of photoelectron angular distribution are scarce in the literature ; the narrow scope of the experimental data sample we could retrieve from the literature and the lack of adequate detail on the characteristics of the reported measurements prevent a meaningful statistical study for the validation of the models used in general purpose monte carlo codes",

    "geant4 angular distribution models exhibit similar behaviour ; the corrected geant 3 model appears in some cases different from the others and qualitatively closer to measurements .",
    "nevertheless , no conclusions can be drawn from such a narrow , qualitative test .",
    "an indirect investigation of photoelectric differential cross section models could be pursued through testing the so - called `` asymmetry parameter '' @xcite ; due to its complexity , this study should be considered as the subject of a dedicated paper .",
    "subshell , at 412 kev.,width=321 ]",
    "an extensive set of cross section models for the simulation of photoionization has been quantitatively evaluated regarding their accuracy at reproducing experimental measurements .",
    "since the validation analysis documented in this paper concerns cross section data libraries and parameterization methods , which are ( and can be ) used by any monte carlo codes , rather than specific implementations of the photoelectric effect , its results , and the recommendations which derive from them , are of general relevance for the simulation of the photoelectrict effect .",
    "statistical tests against a large sample of total and partial cross section measurements demonstrate that tabulations based on scofield s 1973 non - relativistic calculations , which cover an extended range of energies starting from a few electronvolts , achieve the best overall capability to reproduce experiment among the models subject to test .",
    "small differences in the results of goodness - of - fit tests are observed across different compilations ( epdl , penelope database , photx , xcom ) based on the same theoretical calculation method ; they appear related to the granularity of the tabulations . some discrepancies with experiment of epdl - based k  shell cross sections",
    "are observed close to absorption edges , which could be related to intrinsic limitations of the calculations , also highlighted in the evaluation of related calculations of atomic binding energies ; nevertheless , the possibility of systematic effects in these delicate measurements suggests caution in drawing conclusions about the reliability of epdl in the proximity of absorption edges .",
    "no other photoelectric cross section calculation methods , among those considered in this study , demonstrate statistically better accuracy than epdl tabulations : neither theoretical calculations , including relativistic ones , nor empirical or theory - driven analytical parameterizations .",
    "the validation tests documented in this paper demonstrate that the compatibility with experiment of some of them is significantly worse than that of epdl , while it is statistically equivalent for others , although restricted to the energy range they cover .",
    "only k - shell cross sections based on ebel s parameterization produce more accurate results than epdl in some test cases close to absorption edges , although the difference in compatibility with experiment with respect to epdl is not statistically significant .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the evaluation of total cross sections based on biggs and lighthill s parameterization , which is extensively used in geant4 .",
    "while the original set of parameterization coefficients produces cross sections that are statistically equivalent to epdl regarding compatibility with experiment , the modified coefficients implemented in geant4 significantly worsen the resulting cross section compatibility with experimental measurements above a few tens of electronvolt .",
    "the original and modified parameterization produce statistically equivalent compatibility with experiment below a few tens of electronvolt ; both parameterizations , as well as other total cross section models , exhibit low efficiency in that energy range . as a result of this validation test",
    ", it is recommended that future versions of geant4 revert to using the original coefficients of biggs and lighthill parameterization above a few tenso of electronvolt , unless a new , more accurate parameterization is developed and quantitatively demonstrated to improve compatibility with experiment over the original one .",
    "the suggestion to implement this modification in geant4 version 10.2 , which is in preparation at the time of writing this paper , has been conveyed to the maintainers of the related geant4 code .",
    "given that epdl photoelectric cross sections are already used in other geant4 models @xcite , the burden of maintaining alternative cross sections based on biggs - lighthill s parameterization should be considered as well , as this validation test has demonstrated that even the original parameterization is not statistically superior to epdl in reproducing experimental data .",
    "the validation tests show that in the low energy end cross sections based on scofield s non - relativistic calculations produce results consistent with experiment with 0.01 significance down to approximately 150  ev . nevertheless , the limited representativity of the experimental data sample , which only includes noble gases and hydrogen , suggests caution at extrapolating this result to experimental scenarios involving solid targets .",
    "no model , among those considered in this validation study , is able to reproduce experimental data consistently below approximately 150  ev .",
    "their failure at low energies reflects the inadequacy of theoretical calculations in independent particle approximation and of the assumption of isolated atoms adopted in general purpose monte carlo codes , in conditions where effects related to the structure of the interacting material should be taken into account .",
    "the quantitative results of the validation tests documented in this paper allow monte carlo code developers and experimental users to base the selection of physics models in their simulations on sound scientific grounds .",
