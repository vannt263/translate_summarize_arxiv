    "the strong cp problem has two most attractive possibilities : the spontaneously broken peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry  @xcite and the massless quark solution  @xcite . for the case of axion",

    "probably , this is the most attractive theoretical reason for the very light axion  @xcite . on the other hand",

    "it has been conjectured that somehow a symmetry in superstring models would render up quark massless . but this is also disfavored by the problem of no global symmetry in superstring models except the one corresponding to the model - independent axion  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0 parity distinguishes the first family from the second and the third ones .",
    "thus , it is possible to make the first family massless .",
    "this is good for up quark but bad for electron and down quark .",

    "the sneutrino fields have the same quantum number as the down type higgs field @xmath15 ; thus their vev s render electron and down type quark massive .",

    "another kind of @xmath9 parity can be defined such that @xmath17 ( the so - called righthanded up quark singlet superfield ) has a different quantum number from the rest of the quark and lepton superfields .",
