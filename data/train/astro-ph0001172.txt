    "about one quarter of all white dwarfs have helium - rich photospheres and are classified according to the relative strengths of  and   lines in their optical spectra .",
    "these are determined by the ionization balance of the he plasma , depending on the effective temperature of the star .",
    "the db white dwarfs display only  absorption lines , and cover the temperature range from @xmath4k .",
    "temperatures below 11000k are too low to excite  sufficiently to yield observable lines , leading to the featureless dc white dwarfs . in contrast , the hot do stars contain  lines alone , the ionization of helium requiring higher effective temperatures than found in the db white dwarfs . the upper limit to the do temperature range , at approximately 120000k ,",
    "is associated with the helium , carbon and oxygen - rich pg1159 stars ( also denoted as doz by wesemael et  al .",
    "1985 , wgl ) , which are the proposed precursors of the do white dwarfs .",
    "the 45000k lower temperature limit of the do range is some 15000k higher than the beginning of the db sequence , presenting a so - called do - db gap between 30000k and 45000k , first noted by liebert et  al .",
    "subsequent surveys of white dwarfs have failed to find examples of he - rich objects within the gap which continues to present a problem in our understanding of white dwarf evolution .",
    "it is clear , from the existence of the do - db gap and the changing ratio of h - rich to he - rich objects , that white dwarf photospheric compositions evolve as the stars cool",
    ". a number of physical mechanisms may be operating .",
    "for example , the presence of elements heavier than h or he in white dwarf photospheres is the result of radiative forces acting against the downward pull of gravity , preventing these heavy elements sinking out of the atmosphere ( e.g. chayer , fontaine &  wesemael 1995 ) .",
    "a possible explanation of the do - db gap is that , following the agb and pn phases of mass - loss , residual hydrogen mixed in the stellar envelope floats to the surface converting the do stars into das .",
    "later , the onset of convection may mix the hydrogen layer , depending on its thickness , back into the he - rich lower layers , causing the stars to reappear on the db sequence .",
    "any understanding of the possible evolutionary processes depends on several important measurements , including the determination of effective temperature , surface gravity and photospheric composition .",
    "several detailed studies have been carried out for da white dwarfs ( e.g. marsh et  al .",
    "1997 ; wolff et  al .  1998 ; holberg et  al .  1993 , 1994 ;",
    "werner &  dreizler 1994 ) , but comparatively little work has been carried out on the do stars .",
    "this is partly due to the smaller number of stars available for detailed study , but also arises from the comparative difficulty of establishing a reliable self - consistent temperature determination from the lines .",
    "the most recent and probably the most detailed study of the do white dwarf sample has been carried out by dreizler and werner ( 1996 ) .",
    "they applied the results of non - lte model atmosphere calculations to the available optical and uv spectra to determine the atmospheric parameters of 14 stars , confirming the existence of the do - db gap .",
    "dreizler and werner found the mean mass of the white dwarfs in their sample to be @xmath5 , very close to the mean masses of the da and db samples .",
    "a large scatter in heavy element abundances was found , even for stars with similar parameters , and no clear trend along the cooling sequence could be seen .    with such a small sample of",
    "do white dwarfs available for study , each individual object is significant . discovered as a result of the _ rosat _  wfc all - sky survey in the euv , the do white dwarf rej0503@xmath6289 ( wd0501@xmath0289 , mct0501@xmath02858 ) is particularly important because of its low interstellar column density ( barstow et  al .",
    "1994 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it is the only do white dwarf which can be observed throughout the complete spectral range from optical to x - ray and has been the subject of intense study . however , despite this attention , it has not proved possible to generate a model spectrum that is consistent at all wavelengths .",
    "optical determinations of the effective temperature , from a single eso ntt spectrum yield a value of @xmath7k , with a log surface gravity of 7.5 ( barstow et  al .  1994 ; dreizler &  werner 1996 ) .",
    "similar values are obtained from an lte analysis of the far - uv  lines in an _ orfeus _  spectrum of the star ( vennes et  al .",
    "in contrast , a lower temperature of 63000k is required to reproduce the flux level of _ euve _  spectrum and simultaneously match the   and   line strengths in the _ iue _  high dispersion spectra ( barstow et  al .",
    "however , such a low temperature is incompatible with the absence of  4471   and  5876  absorption lines in the optical spectrum , which provides a lower limit on @xmath3 of @xmath8k .",
    "analyses of _ iue _  high dispersion spectra yield measurements of the abundances of c ( also obtained from the optical spectrum ) , n , o and si and give limits on the presence of ni and fe .",
    "more recently , phosphorus has also been detected in the rej0503@xmath0289 _ orfeus _  spectrum ( vennes et  al .",
    "the presence of heavy elements in the atmosphere of any white dwarf , do or da , is known to have a significant effect on the temperature structure of the photosphere and the emergent spectrum . with millions of absorption lines in the euv wavelength range , the influence of iron and nickel is particularly dramatic .",
    "this is illustrated very clearly in the da stars , where the fe and ni opacity produces a steep drop in the observed flux , compared to that expected from a pure h atmosphere ( e.g. dupuis et  al .",
    "1995 ; lanz et  al .",
    "1996 ; wolff et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "in addition , for an h - rich model atmosphere including significant quantities of fe and ni , the change in atmospheric structure also alters the predicted balmer line profiles .",
    "inclusion of these effects , together with a nlte analysis , has the affect of yielding lower balmer line effective temperatures compared with those determined from a pure h - model atmosphere .",
    "this results in a net downward shift of the temperature scale for the hottest heavy element - rich objects ( barstow hubeny &  holberg 1998 ) .",
    "compared to the extensive studies of the effect of fe and ni ( and other elements ) on the atmospheres of da white dwarfs , as discussed above , little has been done in the case of the do stars .",
    "first , there are few detections of these species in the atmospheres of the dos ( see dreizler &  werner 1996 ) .",
    "second , it has been more difficult to calculate suitable stellar model atmospheres for comparison with the data . however , it is possible that their inclusion in such computations might eventually solve the probem of the euv flux .",
    "we present an analysis of _ hst_spectra of rej0503@xmath0289 obtained with the ghrs , which reveal the presence of ni in the atmosphere of the star , but yield only upper limits to the abundance of fe .",
    "we analyse a recent optical spectrum of the star , to determine the effective temperature and surface gravity , and evaluate the possible influence of photospheric ni and trace fe on the estimated temperature .",
    "the optical spectrum of rej0503@xmath0289 was obtained by one of us ( d.f . ) during an observational campaign aimed at the determination of the temperature scale of da white dwarfs ( finley , koester &   basri 1997 ) . the spectrum of rej0503@xmath0289 was obtained on 1992 september @xmath9 at the 3 m shane telescope of the lick observatory , using the kast double spectrograph .",
    "the spectrograph was configured to cover the optical wavelength range from 3300  up to 7500  in one exposure .",
    "a dichroic mirror divides the beam at about 5500 .",
    "the blue spectrum was recorded with a 1200 x 400 reticon ccd providing a resolution varying from a little over 4  fwhm at 4000  to about 6  fwhm at 5000 , with an entrance slit width of @xmath10 .",
    "the red side is recorded separately on a second 1200 x 400 reticon ccd .",
    "exposure times were set to obtain a peak s / n of @xmath11 in the blue spectral region , with the actual s / n ranging from 50 to 110 .",
    "more details of the instrument set up as well as the data reduction are described by ( finley , koester &  basri 1997 ) .",
    "the _ hst _  far uv spectra used in this work were obtained from two separate observing programmes carried out during cycle6 in 1996 and 1997 by two of us ( barstow and werner ) , using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) before its replacement during the second servicing mission .",
    "all spectra utilised the g160 m grating , yielding a spectral resolution @xmath12  rms , the grating angle adjusted to sample different wavelength ranges .",
    "the barstow programme obtained 6 separate exposures covering wavelengths 1233 - 1271  ( 2 spectra ) , 1369 - 1406  ( 3 spectra ) and 1619 - 1655  ( 1 spectrum ) .",
    "the main purpose of the multiple exposures was to monitor any possible variation in absorption line strengths that might be associated with a reported episodic wind ( barstow &  sion 1994 ) .",
    "in contrast , the observations of werner comprised just two single spectra spanning the ranges 1225 - 1265  and 1335 - 1375 .",
    "table  [ obs ] summarises all the ghrs observations . within the observational errors ,",
    "there is no evidence for any changes in the profile of any of the   ( 1238.8/1242.8 ) ,   ( 1371.3 ) and   ( 1393.8/1402.8 ) resonance lines .",
    "measurement of the individual equivalent widths ( table  [ linesw ] ) also fails to show any of the variability that might be associated with the episodic wind reported by barstow &  sion ( 1994 ) .",

    "since the effective temperature and surface gravity of rej0503@xmath0289 are close to 70000k and 7.5 respectively , one of the points of the model atmosphere grid , we adopt these values when applying model calculations to this particular analysis . fig .",
    "[ ghrs2 ] shows the merged ghrs spectrum , described in section 2.2 , together with a synthetic spectrum computed for the nominal c , n , o and si abundances listed in table  [ mods ] and with the fe and ni abundances fixed at @xmath13 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum has been convolved with a 0.042  ( fwhm ) gaussian function to represent the instrumental response .",
    "the positions of all lines with a predicted equivalent width greater or equal to 5m  are marked .",
    "several strong lines from highly ionized species of c , n , o and si are clearly visible , which are most likely to be of photospheric origin . for the most part these have already been identified in the _ iue _  echelle spectra of this star ( barstow &  sion 1994 ; holberg barstow and sion 1998 ) but we list them here , together with their rest wavelengths , measured wavelengths and measured equivalent widths ( table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "however , the improved signal - to - noise of the ghrs spectrum , compared to even the coadded _ iue _  data allows the detection of several new features , which are included in table  [ lines ] .",
    "another important factor may also be the absence of any so - called reseau marks in the ghrs , an important feature of the _ iue_spectra arising from the spatial calibration .",
    "also visible is a single interstellar line of   at 1260.4221 .",
    "apart from these very strongest lines , which are clearly detected , any other possible absorption features are close to the limits of detection imposed by the general signal - to - noise of the data . however , further inspection of fig .",

    "this technique has been applied to _ iue _",
    "data in the past to detect elements such as fe and ni , which do not have any particularly strong resonance transitions but large numbers of comparatively weak features ( see e.g. holberg et  al .",
    "the procedure involves shifting the spectra ( in this case the ghrs data ) into a velocity frame of reference centred on the wavelength of a particular line and then summing and averaging the results for several lines .",
    "if apparent weak features are just random fluctuations of the noise the coaddition process will tend to eliminate them whereas , if the features are real , summing the spectra will produce a more significant combined absorption line .",
    "the typical experimental uncertainties on the original coadded ghrs spectrum are @xmath15% , whereas the scatter from data point to data point on the velocity coadded spectrum is around 2% .    fig .",

    "the availability of ghrs spectra of rej0503@xmath0289 , coupled with a new optical spectrum of the star has revealed important information regarding the structure and evolution of this interesting do white dwarf .",
    "we have used the optical spectrum to determine the temperature and surface gravity of the star which is broadly in agreement with earlier determinations from the original eso optical observation ( barstow et  al.1994 ; dreizler &  werner 1996 ) and the _ orfeus _  far - uv spectrum published by vennes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "perhaps the most important part of this particular optical analysis is the more objective determination of the values of @xmath3 and log g , using a spectral fitting technique , and their respective errors . whether or not these results might be considered to be in agreement or disagreement with the results of vennes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) depends somewhat on how we choose to make the measurement , with or without the   4686 line and using models with or without the elements heavier than h , he or c. in fact such a comparison is probably not particularly instructive as vennes et  al .",
    "used lte models ( compared to our non - lte calculations ) including only h and he .",
    "what is important is that we find that the inclusion of heavy elements in the models may have an influence on the outcome of the temperature determination , as it does for the hot da white dwarfs .",
    "significant abundances of n , o , si , fe and ni ( abundances estimated from the ghrs spectra ) , in addition to the h , he and c treated in the simpler models , lower the value of @xmath3 by approximately 2500k .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed study of any do star probably needs to be entirely self - consistent , combining temperature / gravity and abundance determinatons using spectra from at least visible and uv wavelength ranges .",
    "we note that , in this analysis , a higher fe / he abundance than observed was included in the models used .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath3 change should only be regarded as an upper limit and it must be remembered that systematic errors may be of similar magnitude .",
    "detections of nitrogen , oxygen and silicon in the far uv spectra have already been reported by other authors ( e.g. barstow et  al .",
    "1996 ; barstow &  sion 1994 ; dreizler &  werner 1996 ) , while carbon is clearly seen in both uv and visible bands .",
    "however , while the _ iue _  data may have hinted at the presence of fe and/or ni ( see barstow et  al .",
    "1996 ) , we are able to demonstrate that the star really does contain significant quantites of nickel for the first time , using the ghrs data .",
    "this is revealed initially in marginal detections of the strongest individual ni lines but clearly confirmed when the eight strongest ni lines are coadded in velocity space .",
    "this is the first detection of ni in a non - da white dwarf .",
    "nickel has also been observed in a number of very hot h - rich da white dwarfs ( e.g. holberg et  al .",
    "1994 ; werner &  dreizler 1994 ) and recently reported for one other hot do ( pg0108 + 101 , dreizler 2000 ) but it is always associated with the presence of iron .",
    "furthermore , the measured fe abundance is typically larger than that of ni , by factors between 1 and 20 .",

    "indeed , this technique allows us to place a tighter upper limit on the abundance of fe , at @xmath19 , than imposed by the individual lines .",
    "thus , the abundance of ni is greater than the abundance of fe in rej0503@xmath0289 , in the opposite sense to what is observed in the da white dwarfs , the fe / ni ratio being about one order of magnitude lower than found in those stars . interestingly",
    ", the only other do star with any iron group elements is pg1034 + 001 .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 was reported to have fe vii features but ghrs and coadded iue spectra do not show these features ( werner et  al .   1996 and sion et  al .",

    "for pg0108 + 101 , dreizler ( 2000 ) gives log(fe / he ) @xmath22 and log(ni / he ) @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the only other dos with detectable iron and nickel , have fe / ni ratios @xmath23 , like those of the da stars .",
    "the relative abundances observed in rej0503@xmath0289 are clearly in disagreement with the cosmic abundance ratio of fe / ni ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the predictions of radiative levitation calculations do not offer much help in explaining the observations .",
    "first , while fe and ni levitation has been studied in da white dwarfs , the predicted abundances are much larger than observed , when all possible transitions ( from the kurucz line lists , kurucz 1992 ) are included in the calculations ( chayer et  al .",
    "interestingly , better agreement is achieved , for fe at least , when the subset of lines available in topbase ( cunto et  al .",

    "1995 ) . until recently ,",
    "no similar calculations were available for ni .",
    "although much of the radiative levitation work has concentrated on da white dwarfs , chayer , fontaine &  wesemael ( 1995 ) did deal with radiative levitation on he - rich atmospheres , but only considering elements up to and including fe .",
    "the predicted fe abundance for a star with the temperature and gravity of rej0503@xmath0289 is in excess of @xmath25 , two orders of magnitude above the level observed by us .",
    "recently , dreizler ( 1999 , 2000 ) has calculated nlte model atmospheres taking the radiative levitation and gravitational settling self - consistently into account . in agreement with the results of chayer ,",

    "the observed fe / ni ratio , however , can be reproduced qualitatively by these new models , which predict an excess of the nickel abundance over the iron abundance by a factor of three , but it is also clear that the stratified models do not work very well for the dos , which are best represented by chemically homogeneous calculations .",
    "this clear anomaly mirrors the comparison between predicted and observed abundances for most of the heavy elements ( see table  [ mods ] ) .",

    "we have presented the first direct detection of nickel ( ni / he@xmath2 ) in the photosphere of the hot do white dwarf rej0503@xmath0289 together with a new determination of @xmath3 and log g utilising an objective spectral fitting technique .",
    "nickel has been seen previously in the atmospheres of hot h - rich white dwarfs , but this is one of the first similar discoveries in a he - rich object , detection of ni in pg0108 + 101 having also been recently reported by dreizler ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is also one of a very small number of detections of fe group elements in any of the do white dwarfs .",
    "a careful search for the presence of fe in the star only yields an upper limit of fe / he@xmath1 , implying a fe / ni ratio a factor 10 lower than seen in the h - rich white dwarfs .",
    "although there are no published theoretical predictions , from radiative levitation calculations , for the abundance of ni in he - rich photospheres the observed fe abundance is some two orders of magnitude below that expected .",
    "an explanation of the observed heavy element abundances in this star clearly requires new studies of the various competing effects that determine photospheric abundance , including radiative levitation and possible mass loss via winds .",
    "in addition , model atmosphere calculations need to consider the possible effect of depth - dependent heavy element abundances .",
    "some work of this nature has already been undertaken for da white dwarfs but is only just beginning for he - rich objects .",
    "this work appears to be necessary to explain the continued problem of the inconsistency between the results of the far - uv analyses and the euv spectrum , which can not be matched by a model incorporating the abundances measured here at the optically determined temperature , the predicted euv flux level exceeding that observed by a factor 23 .",

    "<S> we present the first evidence for the direct detection of nickel in the photosphere of the hot do white dwarf rej0503@xmath0289 . while this element has been seen previously in the atmospheres of hot h - rich white dwarfs , </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the first similar discoveries in a he - rich object . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , iron , which is observed to be more abundant than ni in the hot da stars , is not detected , the upper limit to its abundance ( fe / he@xmath1 ) implying a fe / ni ratio a factor 10 lower than seen in the h - rich objects ( ni / he@xmath2 for rej0503@xmath0289 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of nickel and various other elements heavier than he were determined from ghrs spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we used two completely independent sets of nlte model atmospheres which both provide the same results . </S>",
    "<S> this not only reduces the possibility of systematic errors in our analysis but is also an important consistency check for both model atmosphere codes .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also developed a more objective method of determining @xmath3 and log g , from the he lines in the optical spectrum , in the form of a formal fitting of the line profiles to a grid of model spectra , an analogue of the standard procedure utilising the balmer lines in da white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the assigned uncertainties in @xmath3 and log g a firm statistical basis and allows us to demonstrate that inclusion of elements heavier than h , he and c in the spectral calculations , exclusively considered in most published optical analyses , yields a systematic downward shift in the measured value of @xmath3 .    </S>",
