    "in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , a common way to probe the quantum nature of the interaction between light and matter is to drive the system with a classical light field and record the statistics of the photons emitted from the cavity .",
    "for example , a sub - poissonian statistics of output photons is an important evidence of effective photon - photon interactions induced by the atom - cavity coupling  @xcite .",
    "such genuine quantum effects have been observed in a variety of systems , in the so - called strong - coupling regime of cavity qed , when the atom - cavity coupling strength is larger than any dissipation rate  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental progress in tailoring the light - matter interaction has made it possible to achieve a coupling strength that is comparable or even larger than the cavity frequency @xmath0  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the possibility of exploring this so - called ultrastrong coupling regime has stimulated numerous studies on the quantum rabi model that takes into account the counter - rotating terms in the atom - cavity interaction  @xcite .",
    "since dissipation also plays a crucial role in most quantum optical setups , a meaningful description in this context involves a driven - dissipative scenario  @xcite , in which the interplay between cavity losses and the external field drives the system into a steady state .",
    "in such a driven - dissipative setting of the rabi model , it has been shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that as the coupling strength increases from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , a series of transitions occurs in the output photon statistics , leading to a breakdown and revival of the so - called photon blockade effect and to a reversion to non - interacting photons .",
    "it demonstrates that the intricate interplay among the ultrastrong light - matter coupling , the external coherent driving and the dissipation stabilizes the system into a steady state exhibiting a rich quantum optical phenomenology . in this paper , going beyond the study of steady - state properties , we investigate the transient dynamics of the driven - dissipative rabi model and show that it exhibits metastability in the ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "namely , we find that the convergence to the steady state is governed by a time scale significantly larger than the decay times of the atom and the cavity , giving rise to long - lived metastable states .    when the atom - cavity coupling is much smaller than the cavity frequency , the time dependency of the liouvillian can be eliminated by a change of reference frame  @xcite .",
    "all the information on the dynamics and metastable states is then encoded in the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the time - independent liouvillian @xcite .",
    "the break - down of the rotating - wave approximation in the ultrastrong coupling do not allow for such a simple transformation and the master equation remains time - dependent  @xcite . to circumvent this issue we employ a floquet - liouville approach  @xcite : by applying floquet theory to the linblad master equation we reduce the time - dependent master equation to a time - independent eigenvalue problem in an enlarged hilbert space .    within this theoretical framework ,",
    "we compute the long - time dynamics in the weak - excitation regime , for a driving field resonant with the second available transition .",
    "we find that the corresponding liouvillian gap becomes significantly smaller than the natural decay rates as one increases the atom - cavity coupling strength and relate this feature to the dressed - state properties of the rabi hamiltonian .",
    "more specifically , a central role is played by a parity shift occurring in the spectrum , resulting in the existence of two distinct decay channels .",
    "metastability stems from the interplay between the two different time scales involved in these two channels .",
    "the floquet - liouville formalism also allows us to derive analytical expressions for the set of all possible metastable sates in terms of eigenvectors of the floquet - liouvillian and set bounds on the deviations from the steady state .",
    "finally , we discuss practical implications of our analysis for future experiments probing the steady - state properties of the driven - dissipative rabi model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is introduced in sec .",

    "we will focus on a resonant case , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "note that there is no general explicit expression for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the rabi model . in the following",
    ", it will be convenient to label them by using an important symmetry property of the hamiltonian , namely that the parity of the total number of excitations , @xmath11 $ ] , is a conserved quantity .",
    "we will denote by @xmath12 the @xmath13 eigenstate ( @xmath14 ) of the @xmath15 parity subspace and by @xmath16 the corresponding energy . with these notations ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath17 is the state @xmath18 , which is the lowest energy state of the @xmath19 parity subspace ; while the first excited state of @xmath17 , which corresponds to the lowest energy state of the @xmath20 parity subspace , is @xmath21 .",
    "we focus in this paper on a driven - dissipative scenario where the cavity is driven by a monochromatic coherent field and both the cavity and the atom are coupled to their environments , leading to dissipation .",
    "the total time - dependent hamiltonian of the system is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the intensity of the driving field and @xmath24 its frequency .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath25 is governed by a master equation of the form , @xmath26 + \\mathcal{l}_a\\rho+\\mathcal{l}_{\\sigma}\\rho,\\ ] ] where the term @xmath27 describes the dissipation of the system excitations into the environment . in the ultrastrong coupling regime , it is crucial to take fully into account the coupling between the atom and the cavity in the derivation of the master equation  @xcite . in particular , the atom and the cavity can no longer be regarded as being independently coupled to their own environment and the jump operators must involve transitions between eigenstates of the total atom - cavity hamiltonian  @xcite . a natural basis to express",

    "the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the rates of transition from a dressed - state @xmath40 to @xmath41 due to the atomic and cavity decay , respectively ; the transition rates are defined as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the transition frequency and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are respectively the cavity and the atom decay rates .",
    "note that the transition between states belonging to the same parity space is forbidden because both operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 change the parity of the state . in eqs",
    "( [ mediss ] ) and ( [ trans_rates ] ) , the usual quantum optical master equation in which the jump operators are simply @xmath4 and @xmath48 is recovered when the coupling strength is much smaller than the cavity frequency .    in the following",
    ", we will be interested in the long time dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) . as in most quantum optical setups , the relevant observables to characterize",
    "the system are correlation functions of the output field . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the output field in the ultrastrong coupling is proportional to an operator @xmath49 , defined in the dressed - state basis as : @xmath50 the two main correlation functions that we will consider are the intensity of the emitted photons , which is proportional to @xmath51 , and the second - order correlation function , which reads @xmath52 note that except for a sufficiently small @xmath9 , where the rotating approximation on qubit - cavity coupling can be applied , eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) generally does not have a particular rotating - frame where the equation becomes time - independent .",
    "therefore , the solution has a residual oscillation at the driving frequency @xmath24 even in the @xmath53 limit .",
    "the steady - state properties are then obtained by averaging the solution over several driving periods , which corresponds to a time integrated measurement in an actual experiment  @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have shown that in terms of output photon statistics , the most interesting properties are obtained when driving the second available transition , @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "we will therefore also focus on this driving scenario in all that follows .",
    "one of the main characteristic of the steady state is then that the @xmath55 function exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "more precisely , four different phases of photon emission can be identified : the photon blockade effect that is well - known to occur in the strong coupling regime [ @xmath56 persists up to a coupling strength @xmath57 .",
    "it is then followed by a break - down and revival of the photon blockade effect ( for @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively ) , and a transition to a noninteracting regime ( for @xmath60 ) .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeinteg ] , where the blue solid line shows the output intensity @xmath61 and @xmath55 in the steady state as a function of the coupling strength @xmath62 . the intensity of the driving field and the dissipation rates are chosen such that the system stays in a weak - excitation regime : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeinteg ] also shows the same quantities obtained for long but finite simulation times @xmath65 ( where the system is assumed to be in the ground - state at @xmath66 ) . for both finite - time and steady - state values ,",
    "fast oscillations are eliminated by averaging over one period of the driving frequency ( a time much smaller than the decay time )  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we observe that the long - time dynamics in the regime where the revival of the photon - blockade occurs , i.e. , @xmath59 , sharply stands out from other coupling strengths : the output intensity and the correlation function are far from having reached their steady - state values even after a time significantly longer than the natural relaxation time , i.e. , @xmath67 , while for both @xmath68 and @xmath69 the steady - state values are already reached for @xmath70 .",
    "these unexpected , large discrepancies between the exact steady - state values and the finite - time simulations in the ultrastrong coupling regime suggest the emergence of a new relaxation time scale . to explore this further ,",
    "we compute numerically the exact long - time dynamics of the output intensity for different values of @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedyn ] ( a ) @xmath61 is shown as a function of time @xmath65 , for times up to @xmath71 , and for @xmath72 , 1.2 and 1.5 .",

    "[ fig : timeinteg ] . for @xmath72 ( blue dashed - dotted line )",
    ", there is only one time scale in the transient dynamics and the steady - state value is reached for @xmath73 .",
    "this is a common feature for any coupling strength @xmath68 . for @xmath74 , ( dashed red lines )",
    ", this simple picture is significantly modified .",
    "the steady - state value is only reached for @xmath75 and two distinct phases in the transient dynamics are visible : a first evolution leads the system to an intermediate state for @xmath76 , followed by a slower decay to the steady state .",
    "this separation of time scales in the dynamics is greatly amplified for @xmath77 ( solid yellow line ) . in this case , the intermediate state is a long - lived metastable state .",
    "the output intensity is quasi - constant for a large time interval @xmath78 and reaches its asymptotic value only for @xmath79 .",
    "the transient dynamics is thus characterized by a gap between the two time scales for fast and slow decay processes , giving rise to metastable states .",
    "the numerical results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : timeinteg ] and  [ fig : timedyn ] are one of the main findings of the present paper .",
    "they will be of significant experimental relevance for any setup in which the time scale of the the experiment is shorter than the time necessary to reach the steady state . in this case",
    ", the measured properties of the system in the long time limit would be that of metastable states and not of the true steady state .",
    "the principal aim of the remaining part of the paper is to establish a proper understanding of our numerical observations and explore the metastability in the driven - dissipative rabi model in a systematic fashion . in the case of _ time - indepedent",

    "( [ me ] ) should therefore be cast into a time - independent form .",
    "however , due to the presence of the counter - rotating terms , there does not exist a reference frame where the time dependency is eliminated . instead ,",
    "as we will see in the next section , a time - independent formulation can be established by employing a floquet - liouville approach  @xcite .    in this framework",
    ", eigenvalues of a floquet - liouvillian operator will play the same role as those of the usual liouvillian .",
    "to illustrate this idea and motivate further the use of floquet theory , we anticipate on what will follow and show on fig .",

    "the black dotted lines show an exponential fit with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath81 of the floquet - liouvillian operator , which will be introduced in the following section .",
    "the perfect agreement in the long - time limit is consistent with the separation of time scale described previously ; after a sufficiently long time , only one slow - decaying component remains .",
    "floquet theory applies to linear differential equations with periodic coefficients  @xcite and , in the present context , can be used to reduce the time - dependent master equation to a time - independent eigenvalue problem in an enlarged hilbert space .",
    "although this so - called floquet - liouville approach is known and has found applications in various fields @xcite , it has not , to the best of our knowledge , been directly applied to the current setting of the driven and dissipative rabi model .",

    "[ fig : timeinteg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : metamanifold ] , we find that the metastable state observed when the system is in its ground state at @xmath211 is very close to the state @xmath206 .",
    "conversly , a metastable state close to @xmath207 is obtained when the initial state is the first excited state @xmath212 ( not shown ) .",
    "+    a qualitative explanation for the difference in photon statistics for @xmath206 and @xmath207 can be drawn from the dressed state properties of the rabi model and the competing decay processes at play .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec](a ) , when the transition @xmath213 is driven , there appear two decay channels for @xmath214 , after a parity shift in the spectrum has occurred  @xcite .",
    "the first decay channel involves the direct transition @xmath215 , while the second one involves the cascaded transition @xmath216 .",
    "because the direct transition leads to sub - poissonian and the cascaded transition to super - poissonian statistics of the output photons  @xcite , we can expect that the competition between these two decay processes will ultimately determine the output photon statistics .",
    "more precisely , numerical simulations show that the metastable state @xmath206 is mainly a statistical mixture of @xmath217 and @xmath218 , namely @xmath219 , with @xmath220 .",
    "the metastable state @xmath207 on the other hand is a statistical mixture of @xmath212 and @xmath221 , @xmath222 , with @xmath223 .",
    "this means that @xmath206 and @xmath207 can be reached when the dominant relaxation process is the direct transition or the cascaded transition , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath206 leads to a pronounced photon blockade that can be even stronger than in the steady state while , in contrast , @xmath207 shows photon bunching ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : metamanifold ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the observed metastable state depends sensitively on the initial state .",
    "for example , when the initial state is the ground state , the eigenstates @xmath212 and @xmath221 can be populated only through the cascaded transition .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ]  ( b ) that the transition rates @xmath224 and @xmath225 for @xmath226 and @xmath227 respectively , drop sharply for @xmath228 , while the transition rates @xmath229 and @xmath230 for @xmath231 and @xmath232 are much higher and satisfy @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , the processes leading to the system being in the subspace @xmath234 take place at a much slower rate . hence ,",
    "on the relatively short time scale on which metastability is observed , this subspace does not play a significant role in the dynamics and the metastable state is very close to @xmath206 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : timeinteg ] ( b ) ] .    to summarize , the general physical picture is the following : the steady state is reached when the pumping mechanisms exactly compensate the losses induced by the different decay channels . in the rabi model ,",
    "the parity shift occurring in the hamiltonian for @xmath235 leads to the existence of two distinct decay channels [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ( a ) ] .",
    "furthermore , the time scales involved in these two channels become widely separated as the coupling strength becomes larger than the cavity frequency ( @xmath236 ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ( b ) ] . as a result",
    ", there exists an intermediate time scale in which losses from the fast decay channel are already compensated by the driving field while the other channel has not yet come into play .",
    "in such a time interval , which is long enough to be observed experimentally , the system is in a metastable state whose properties can differ radically from those of the true steady state .",
    "discrepancies between metastable states and the steady state are particularly sharp in the regime of coupling strength where the revival of the photon blockade takes place [ @xmath208 ] , since in this regime the two decay channels have opposite effects on the photon statistics : the fast one favors the photon blockade effect , while the slower one destroys it by inducing additional fluctuations .",
    "this picture however breaks down for @xmath238 where the energy spectrum of the rabi model becomes quasi - linear  @xcite ; in this case , the states @xmath239 and @xmath240 are quasi - degenerate and the relaxation processes also involve transitions between higher - energy states .",
    "the decay channels are now two distinct `` ladders '' : @xmath241 when the initial state is the ground state , and @xmath242 when the system is initially in its first excited state .",
    "a separation of time scales still exists in this regime ; it stems from the very low probability of transition between the two ladders through processes such as @xmath243 .",
    "however , the two channels both lead to a quasi - coherent statistics , explaining the convergence of the metastable - states properties to those of the steady state .",
    "in this section we evaluate the robustness of our findings against pure dephasing noise , inevitably present in any experimental setup . following ref .  @xcite we model the dephasing noise by including an additional term in the liouvillian .",
    "its general form is , @xmath244 \\\\   & + \\sum_{p=\\pm}\\sum_{k , j}\\theta(\\delta_{jk}^{pp})\\phi_{jk}^{pp}\\mathcal{d}[|\\psi_j^{p}\\rangle\\langle \\psi_k^{p}| ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for this type of noise , the transition rates depend on the matrix elements of the operator @xmath245 in the dressed - state basis and are given by @xmath246 these coefficients depend on the spectral density of the bath at the different transition frequencies @xmath247 , expressed by the function @xmath248 .",
    "just as in the case of the other dissipative terms , we assumed that the spectral density of the bath vanishes at negative frequency , since the system is in thermal equilibrium at zero temperature .",
    "note that in contrast with the operators @xmath4 and @xmath249 , the operator @xmath245 can induce transitions only between states of the same parity . in principle , the additional transitions between dressed - states induced by the dephasing noise can affect the transient regime and reduce the life time of the metastable states .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : liouvgapdeph ] , numerical simulations of the floquet - liouvillian eigenvalues for a white dephasing noise , whose rate is comparable to the other noise sources [ @xmath250 . globally , the real part of the eigenvalues is larger , which means that the time to reach state is indeed reduced compared to the results of fig .",
    "( [ fig : liouvgap ] ) .",
    "however , the clear separation of time scales is still visible and the life time of the metastable states is long enough to allow for experimental observation .",
    "hence , there is no qualitative change and our results remain valid even when this additional noise channel is included in the model .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the long - time dynamics and metastability of the driven - dissipative rabi model in the ultrastrong coupling regime within the framework of floquet - liouville theory . in the ultrastrong coupling regime ,",
    "the counter - rotating terms make the master equation for the driven rabi model explicitly time - dependent , and the floquet - liouville theory allows one to eliminate this explicit time - dependence by considering the time evolution in an enlarged hilbert space of periodic matrices .",
    "our work demonstrates that the use of floquet - liouville theory in the driven - dissipative rabi model not only makes an efficient calculation of arbitrarily long time - evolution possible , but also enables one to obtain analytical results and a qualitative understanding .",
    "more specifically , we have considered a driving scenario in which the external field is resonant with the second available transition and have shown that , as the atom - cavity coupling strength becomes larger than the cavity frequency , @xmath251 , the time necessary to reach the steady state becomes much larger that the natural relaxation time @xmath252 . within the framework of floquet - liouville theory ,",
    "the different time scales of the transient dynamics are understood by investigating the eigenvalues of the time - independent floquet - liouvillian operator . for @xmath253 , one non - zero eigenvalue with zero imaginary part ( purely dissipative mode )",
    "was found to be several orders of magnitude smaller than all the other eigenvalues , explaining the emergence of long - lived metastable states .",
    "we attributed this feature of the floquet - liouvillian to the existence of two decay channels for the system with different transition rates .",
    "in particular , the transition rates for the first and third part of the cascaded transition @xmath216 go to zero as @xmath62 increases . as a result , this decay channel starts to play a significant role only in the long - time dynamics . during the large time interval",
    "for which the other decay channel , @xmath215 dominates , the system reaches a metastable state , which eventually decays into the true steady state when the second channel comes into play .    by extending the recently developed metastability theory  @xcite to our time - dependent setting through the floquet - liouville approach",
    ", we also derived analytical expressions for the set of all possible metastable states in terms of eigenvectors of the floquet - liouvillian .",
    "this enabled us to set bounds on the deviation from the true steady state that could be observed in an experiment .",
    "more specifically , we showed that for @xmath208 the photon statistics in the metastable states can differ drastically from that of the steady state ; it can either show an enhanced anti - bunching or , conversely , strong bunching .",
    "all these results were derived by considering dissipation coming from the coupling of the cavity and the atom to the environment at zero temperature .",
    "we have also performed additional simulations including pure dephasing noise and have shown that our findings remain unchanged when this etra noise channel is included in the model .    in a circuit qed experiment with a typical cavity frequency @xmath0 of the order of the ghz and dissipation rates similar to the one considered here [ @xmath254 , the time scale on which metastability will be observed is of the order of 0.1 millisecond , a time sufficiently short to be reached experimentally .",

    "we give in this appendix a more detailed and self - contained presentation of floquet theory and its formulation in the floquet space introduced in the main text .",
    "to simplify the notations , we consider the case of a usual schrdinger equation on a hilbert space @xmath87 of finite dimension @xmath255 , @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a periodic matrix of period @xmath91 and @xmath258 a vector in @xmath87 .",
