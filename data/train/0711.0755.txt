    "the introduction of parton wigner distributions in the nucleon  @xcite provided us with a rigorous landscape of the different approaches to the hadron structure , linking together all possible hadronic observables .",
    "there is unfortunately as of today no known experimental process to access them .",
    "projecting out light - cone energy and transverse momenta , a fourier transform leads to generalized parton distributions  ( gpds ) .",
    "those encompass form factors and parton distribution functions , as well as a wealth of new physical informations .",
    "for instance , the energy - momentum tensor of partons in the nucleon can be parameterized in terms of gpds , providing distributions of masses , angular momenta , or forces inside the nucleon  @xcite .    in the bjorken limit , the amplitude for deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xmath1 factorizes  ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig : handbag ] ) , and the scattering occurs at the quark level .",
    "this is considered to be the cleanest process to access the gpds .",
    "first observations  @xcite are in agreement with twist-2 dominance in the gpds formalism .",
    "a first dedicated experiment  @xcite demonstrates that scaling is achieved at moderate values of @xmath2 , as expected both from theoretical considerations and the successfull description of dis down to @xmath3 gev@xmath4 .    in the reaction @xmath0 , the beam - spin asymmetry of the reaction results from the interference between dvcs and bethe - heitler processes , for which the outgoing photon was emitted by the electron . this asymmetry  : @xmath5 has been measured as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath6 , the momentum transfer to the proton @xmath7 , and the angle @xmath8 between the leptonic and hadronic planes .",
    "harmonic decompositions  @xcite have been proposed for the cross - sections .",
    "the cross - section difference @xmath9 is proportional to the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude , and sensitive to a specific combination of gpds @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "using jlab continuous electron beam at energy @xmath14 gev , with average @xmath15% polarisation and intensity @xmath16 na on a 2.5  cm - long liquid hydrogen target , we collected @xmath17 fb@xmath18 .",
    "a new lead - tungstate calorimeter was added to clas to detect photons between 4.5 and 15@xmath19 .",
    "avalanche photodiodes collect the light out of the 424 tapered crystals 16  cm long , with average section 2.1  @xmath20 , each monitored with laser light .",
    "resolutions achieved in energy are better than 5% at 1  gev , in angle 3 to 4  mrad , and in time less than 1  ns .",
    "a superconducting solenoidal magnet actively shields the background of mller electrons at low angles and energies .",
    "we selected events with one and only one electron ( trigger ) , proton and photon .",
    "the electron identification uses mainly deposited energy in clas calorimeters compared to momentum measured by drift chambers , and erenkov counters .",
    "the protons were separated from positive pions through time - of - flight and track length compared to momentum .",
    "photon detection threshold was set at 150 mev .",
    "the mere selection of the 3-particle final state results in clear exclusive peaks in the momentum and energy balance spectra .",
    "in addition , we required the missing transverse momentum less than 90 mev / c , the detected photon within 1.2@xmath19 from the predicted one , and the angle between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 planes smaller than 1.5@xmath19 .",
    "the neutral pion electroproduction @xmath23 can still contaminate our @xmath24 sample , in the case were the @xmath25 decay was asymmetric with one of the photon below the energy threshold , or outside the calorimeters acceptance . this contamination was estimated in a model - independent way from simulation and subtracted in each elementary bin and for each helicity state .",
    "the integrated asymmetry is displayed in figure  [ fig : bsaint ] , together with the kinematical coverage in the @xmath26 plane , and one single @xmath27 elementary bin fitted with expected shape .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 estimates the asymmetry at @xmath29 and is shown in ( black ) circles as a function of @xmath30 in the @xmath26 plane in figure  [ fig : bsa_vs_t ] . also appearing are results from clas first observation in a ( red ) square , and hall - a in ( green ) triangles .",
    "a gpd semi - phenomenological model  @xcite appearing in ( blue ) solid ( twist-2 ) and dashed - dotted ( twist-3 ) lines in this plot reproduces reasonably the data .",
    "a regge - inspired calculation  @xcite in dotted lines proves fair agreement in some bins .",
    "a possible duality between those two descriptions , in terms of regge - exchanges and gpd formalism , remains to be investigated .      9 x.  ji , _ phys .",
