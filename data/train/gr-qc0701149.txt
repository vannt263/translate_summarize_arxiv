    "classical singularities are a common feature in solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "they are not part of the spacetimes themselves , but are boundary points indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration in maximal spacetimes ( see , @xmath2 , @xcite ) . for timelike geodesics in particular ,",
    "this incompleteness is characterized by an abrupt ending of classical freely - falling particle paths .",
    "classical particles do not exist , however , so horowitz and marolf @xcite , following earlier work by wald @xcite , asked what happens if , instead of classical particles , one uses quantum mechanical particles to identify singularities ?",
    "horowitz and marolf answered the question as follows @xcite .",
    "they define a spacetime to be quantum mechanically @xmath3singular if the evolution of a test scalar wave packet , representing a quantum particle , is uniquely determined by the initial wave packet , without having to place arbitrary boundary conditions at the classical singularity .",
    "if a quantum particle approaches a quantum singularity , however , its wave function may change in an indeterminate way ; it may even be absorbed or another particle emitted .",
    "this is a close analog to the definition of classical singularities : a classical singularity , as the endpoint of geodesics , can affect a classical particle in an arbitrary way ; it can , for example , absorb ( or not ) an approaching particle , and can emit ( or not ) some other particle , undetermined by what comes before in spacetime .",
    "the construction of horowitz and marolf is restricted to static spacetimes .",
    "mathematically , the evolution of a quantum wave packet is related to properties of the appropriate quantum mechanical operator .",
    "they therefore define a static spacetime to be quantum mechanically singular @xcite if the spatial portion of the klein - gordon operator is not essentially self - adjoint @xcite . in this case",
    "the evolution of a test scalar wave packet is not determined uniquely by the initial wave packet ; boundary conditions at the classical singularity are needed to ` pick out ' the correct wavefunction , and thus one needs to add information that is not already present in the wave operator , spacetime metric and manifold .",
    "horowitz and marolf @xcite showed by example that although some classically singular spacetimes are quantum mechanically singular as well , others are quantum mechanically @xmath3singular . a number of papers have tested additional spacetimes to see whether or not the use of quantum particles `` heals '' their classical singularities .",
    "for example , we have studied quasiregular and levi - civita spacetimes , and used maxwell and dirac operators as well as the klein - gordon operator , showing that they give comparable results @xcite .",
    "blau , frank , and weiss have studied two - parameter spherically - symmetric geometries whose metric coefficients are power - laws in the radius @xmath0 in the limit of small @xmath0 @xcite . using a different hilbert - space norm , ishibashi and hosoya have studied the wave regularity of various spacetimes with timelike singularities @xcite .",
    "a critical question in all of this work is : when is the use of quantum particles effective in healing classical singularities ?",
    "here we investigate what we believe to be the broadest class of spacetimes yet tested .",
    "nearly all are classically singular when one of the spatial variables ( @xmath0 ) approaches zero .",
    "the characterization of their quantum singularity properties requires only that we know their behavior at infinity and at small @xmath0 , along with an assumption that they have no classical singularities aside from any at @xmath4 . for small @xmath0",
    ", these spacetimes can be represented by metrics with coefficients which are powers of @xmath0 involving four independent parameters .",
    "we will find the range of each of the metric parameters for which the singularity is healed in the sense of horowitz and marolf .",
    "a relativistic scalar quantum particle of mass @xmath5 can be described by a positive - frequency solution to the klein - gordon equation    @xmath6    in a static spacetime @xcite .",
    "the spatial klein - gordon operator @xmath7 is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the timelike killing field ) and @xmath11 is the spatial covariant derivative on the static slice @xmath12 .",
    "the appropriate hilbert space @xmath13 is @xmath14 , the space of square integrable functions on @xmath12 .",
    "the volume element used to define @xmath13 is @xmath15 times the natural volume element on @xmath12 .",
    "if we initially define the domain of @xmath7 to be @xmath16 , @xmath7 is a real positive symmetric operator and self - adjoint extensions always exist @xcite . if there is a single unique self - adjoint extension @xmath17 , then @xmath7 is essentially self - adjoint @xcite . in this case",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a free relativistic particle can be written @xcite    @xmath18    with    @xmath19    equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are ambiguous if @xmath7 is not essentially self - adjoint , in which case the spacetime is quantum mechanically singular .",
    "one way to test for essential self - adjointness is to use the von neumann criterion of deficiency indices @xcite , which involves studying solutions to @xmath20 and finding the number of solutions that are square integrable ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) for each sign of @xmath23 .",
    "this determines the deficiency indices , which in turn indicates whether the operator is essentially self - adjoint or whether it has self - adjoint extensions , and how many self - adjoint extensions it has .",
    "another approach , which we have used before @xcite and will use here , has a more direct physical interpretation .",
    "a theorem of weyl @xcite relates the essential self - adjointness of the hamiltonian operator to the behavior of the ` potential ' which in turn determines the behavior of the scalar - wave packet .",
    "the effect is determined by a @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 criterion which we discuss in section 3 .",
    "we consider the class of spacetimes which can be written with the power - law metric form    @xmath27    in the limit of small @xmath0 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are constant parameters .",
    "we are particularly interested in the metrics at small @xmath0 , because we suppose that if the spacetime has a classical singularity ( and nearly all of these do ) , it occurs at @xmath4 , and the first - order behavior of the metric near that location is sufficient to establish whether the quantum mechanical operator is limit point or limit circle at @xmath4 .    eliminating @xmath30 by scaling @xmath0 results in two metric types :    * type i : @xmath31 + if @xmath32 , and * type ii : @xmath33 + if @xmath34 .",
    "type i metrics are special cases of the general cylindrically symmetric geometries @xcite    @xmath35    with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . in particular , the two - parameter levi - civita spacetimes @xcite    @xmath40    are type i ( if @xmath41 ) , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and type ii ( if @xmath46 ) , with @xmath47 , a flat spacetime .    for type i metrics ,",
    "the curvature and kretschmann scalars are    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    which vanish if and only if @xmath50 and one of the following holds : ( i ) @xmath51 ( ii ) @xmath52 ( iii ) @xmath53 .",
    "each of these three geometries is flat everywhere , although in case ( iii ) there is a quasiregular singularity at @xmath4 unless @xmath54 , assuming @xmath55 .",
    "except for these three special cases , type i spacetimes all have scalar curvature singularities as @xmath56 if and only if @xmath57 .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by inspecting the other independent curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 subspace of type i metrics can be written in the form    @xmath59    so radial null geodesics follow paths of constant @xmath60 .",
    "any singularity at @xmath4 occurs at a finite value of @xmath0 along the geodesic , so the singularity is timelike and naked @xcite .    for the type ii metrics the curvature and kretschmann scalars",
    "are    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    each of which vanishes if and only if @xmath51 , in which case the spacetimes are flat . in all other cases type",
    "ii spacetimes have a scalar curvature singularity as @xmath56 if and only if @xmath63 .",
    "again , the other curvature invariants confirm this result @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 subspace of type ii metrics can be written in the form    @xmath64    where the tortoise coordinate @xmath65 .",
    "radial null geodesics follow paths of constant @xmath66 .",
    "a singularity at @xmath4 occurs at @xmath67 , so the singularity in this case is null @xcite ; in double - null coordinates it can be seen to have both past and future branches , and to be naked , as shown by lake @xcite .",
    "we have established that except for isolated values of @xmath68 , all of these power - law spacetimes have scalar curvature singularities if and",
    "only if @xmath63 . lake @xcite has shown that all of the @xmath4 singularities in type ii spacetimes are at finite affine distance , while those in type i spacetimes are at finite affine distance if and only if @xmath69 .",
    "therefore even though type i spacetimes with @xmath70 possess scalar curvature singularities , they are nevertheless geodesically complete , so are nonsingular by the usual definition .",
    "we can now work out the parameter ranges for which the classical singularities are healed using the horowitz - marolf criterion .",
    "for the power - law metrics the klein - gordon equation can be separated in the coordinates @xmath71 , with only the radial equation left to solve . with changes in both dependent and independent variables ,",
    "the radial equation can be written as a one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the operator @xmath74 .",

    "one can similarly analyze the intersections of any two planes , to find which points are lc and which lp .    for type ii spacetimes the classical singularities are null , as shown in section 2 .",

    "the same situation arises for any spherically symmetric potential @xmath172 as long as @xmath173 . in the free - particle ( @xmath174 ) case ,",
    "for example , the two solutions of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation near the origin for @xmath169 are @xmath175 and @xmath176 , so @xmath177 converges and @xmath178 diverges as @xmath179 .",

    "the free schrdinger operator @xmath209 ( without a @xmath139-function potential ) is hermitian and also self - adjoint when its domain includes functions that are finite or that diverge at isolated points , as long as they are square integrable , and that a boundary condition , consistent with self - adjointness of @xmath209 , is specified .",

    "satisfies the wec , while the rest does not .",
    "for example , for @xmath268 the limit - circle triangle has sides @xmath142 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270",
    ". the parameter points within this triangle all violate the wec with the exception of those within the smaller , contained triangle whose sides are along @xmath142 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 .",
    "that is , only 1/9 of the area within the @xmath268 triangle corresponds to spacetimes satisfying the wec . for slices with @xmath273",
    "the percentage of wec - obeying points falls , but is never zero .",
    "therefore if the wec is enforced , most , but @xmath190 @xmath274 , of the quantum mechanically singular spacetimes can be eliminated .",
    "the dominant - energy condition ( dec ) is more stringent that the wec , so has the potential to eliminate even more spacetimes within the limit - circle regime .",
    "the dec requires not only that @xmath250 for any timelike vector @xmath251 , but also that @xmath275 be a non - spacelike vector , so that to any observer the local energy density is non - negative , and in addition the local energy flow vector is non - spacelike , @xmath276 , causal . for our metrics",
    "the dec conditions require @xmath252 and @xmath277 , the same as for the wec except for the additional requirement that the pressure must not exceed the energy density , @xmath276 , that @xmath278 .",
    "most interesting is the effect of the dec conditions on the smaller , contained triangle described above , with sides along @xmath142 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "spacetimes with parameters within this triangle obey the wec for @xmath279 .",
    "they also obey the dec for @xmath268 , but as @xmath137 becomes increasingly positive , more and more of the triangle s area in the vicinity of the ( @xmath280 ) vertex fails to satisfy the dec , such that in the limit @xmath281 the entire area fails to satisfy the dec .",
    "for any finite @xmath137 , however , a set of parameters exist for which the dec is satisfied within the limit - circle bowl , clustered near @xmath282 .",
    "more precisely , for points along the line @xmath283 , if the upper limit of these parameters for the dec region is represented by @xmath284 , then @xmath285 as @xmath281 .    in summary , those type i spacetimes with @xmath286 are entirely eliminated if either the wec or the dec is invoked .",
    "( these spacetimes are nonsingular anyway , since they are geodesically complete ) . for any other finite value of @xmath137",
    "there is a range of parameters @xmath287 which satisfies the wec , and a ( nearly always smaller but non - zero ) range of parameters which satisfy the dec .",
    "although either energy condition is helpful in eliminating quantum singularities from power - law spacetimes , neither is entirely successful .",
    "of course @xmath288 condition is necessarily valid anyway , since the casimir effect illustrates that local negative energy densities are possible .",
    "we have shown that for a broad class of four - parameter metrics , whose metric coefficients behave as power laws in a radial coordinate @xmath0 in the limit of small @xmath0 , there are large regions of parameter space in which classically singular spacetimes ( whose singularities are indicated by incomplete timelike or null geodesics ) are  healed \" by quantum mechanics , in that quantum particle propagation is well - defined throughout the spacetime .",
    "these metrics separate naturally into type i and type ii spacetimes . the singularities in type",
    "i are timelike and naked ; the singularities in type ii are null and naked .",
    "to study quantum particle propagation in these spacetimes we use massive scalar particles described by the klein - gordon equation and the limit circle - limit point criterion of weyl .",
    "in particular , we study the radial equation in a one - dimensional schrdinger form with a  potential \" and determine the number of solutions that are square integrable .",
    "if we obtain a unique solution , without placing boundary conditions at the location of the classical singularity , we can say that the solution to the full klein - gordon equation is quantum mechanically nonsingular .",
    "the results depend on spacetime metric parameters and wave equation modes .",
    "the schrdinger potential determines whether a mode solution for a wave in a given spacetime is limit point ( one unique square - integrable , @xmath289 solution ) or limit circle ( two @xmath82 solutions ) .",
    "the boundary of the limit circle ( lc ) regime in type i metrics is shown in figure 1 , for given modes defined by an azimuthal quantum number @xmath290 and an axial quantum number @xmath291 ( which describes the solutions along the @xmath248-axis , the spatial axis of symmetry . ) for non - zero @xmath290 and @xmath291 , the boundary forms a `` bowl '' , with the lc regime inside ( and on part of the boundary itself ) , while the lp regime is outside ( and on the rest of the boundary . )",
    "one can easily see that a large set of classically singular spacetimes probed by non - zero mode wave solutions is non - singular quantum mechanically",
    ". physically speaking , a unique square - integrable solution is found when the potential near the origin is sufficiently repulsive .",
    "a sufficiently repulsive potential makes one of the solutions ( @xmath237 ) of schrdinger s equation become very small as it tunnels toward the origin , so small that the other solution @xmath292 diverges at a rate such that it fails to be square integrable .",
    "the  sufficiently repulsive potential \" in question is at least as repulsive as @xmath293    two of the four  walls \" forming the bowl boundary for type i metrics vanish for modes with @xmath164 and @xmath294 however , all @xmath164 modes turn out to be effectively lp anyway , because one of the @xmath164 solutions fails to solve the integrated three - dimensional wave equation .",
    "the vanishing of the @xmath145 retaining wall if @xmath246 is a more serious problem in limiting the lc regime .",
    "the only obvious way to prevent this is to ban @xmath246 modes themselves by requiring that the quantum wave packets have some locality in the @xmath248 direction .",
    "the type ii geometry results are even more dramatic ; every classically - singular geometry of this type is healed when quantum particles are used .",
    "type ii spacetimes are in fact globally hyperbolic , so the wave operator is essentially self - adjoint and there are by definition no quantum singularities in this case .    of those type i geometries with quantum singularities , it is interesting to ask how many could be eliminated by one or another energy condition .",
    "we use the weak energy condition and dominant energy condition to show that if either condition were required , most but @xmath190 @xmath274 parameter ranges would thereby be eliminated .",
    "of course , our freedom to invoke either one of these conditions is not guaranteed physically .",
    "overall , it is clear that a large class of the classically singular power - law spacetimes we have examined is quantum mechanically nonsingular .",
    "the quantum particle approach introduced by horowitz and marolf @xcite is a powerful mechanism for blunting the effect of classical singularities . it does not heal all such singularities , but it does heal many of them",
    "this has ramifications for the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in the sense of wald s  physical formulation \" , that all physically reasonable spacetimes are globally hyperbolic , so that apart from a possible initial singularity , no singularity is ever  visible \" to any observer @xcite .",
    "our type ii spacetimes are globally hyperbolic , with a past - null singularity we could count as  initial \" , so they obey the conjecture .",
    "type i spacetimes have classical timelike naked singularities , so the healing of many of them by the quantum particle approach reduces but does not eliminate the incidence of potential conflicts with strong cosmic censorship .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the important related work of curtis vinson , zachary walters , zoe boekelheide , ne - te loh , and andrew mugler .",
