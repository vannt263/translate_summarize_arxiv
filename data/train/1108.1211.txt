    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary star systems that are composed of a compact primary ( a neutron star or a black hole ) that accretes the outer gaseous layers of a ( sub- ) solar - mass companion star",
    ". neutron star primaries can reveal themselves by showing coherent x - ray pulsations when the accretion flow is funnelled onto the magnetic poles of the neutron star , or by displaying type - i x - ray bursts caused by unstable thermonuclear burning of the accreted matter on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "many neutron star lmxbs are transient and alternate active accretion outbursts with long episodes of quiescence . whereas outbursts typically last a only few weeks and generate 0.510 kev x - ray luminosities of @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it has been attributed e.g. , to shock emission generated in the interaction of a residual accretion flow with the magnetic field of the neutron star , or the re - activation of a radio pulsar in quiescence @xcite .",

    "we thus conclude that this model does not correctly describe the data .    fitting the 2009 spectral data with a simple absorbed powerlaw yields @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 for 22 dof ) .",

    "we fitted the two data sets simultaneously to an absorbed powerlaw model . when all spectral parameters are forced to be the same ( i.e. , assuming there are no spectral differences between the two data sets ) , we obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath29 ( 38 dof ) . enabling the powerlaw normalisation to vary between the two epochs ( i.e. , allowing only the intensity to change )",

    "as a result , the absorption column density along the line of sight may be variable .",
    "we therefore fitted the quiescent data of exo 1745248  with the powerlaw spectral index fixed between the two epochs , while the hydrogen column density was allowed to vary .",
    "the results from this fit suggest that the x - ray spectrum was possibly more absorbed in 2009 , although the fit - values obtained for the two epochs are consistent within the errors ( see table  [ tab : spec ] ) . keeping the hydrogen column density fixed and instead allowing the powerlaw index to vary yields a harder spectral index for the 2009 data ,",

    "the spectral analysis is inconclusive as to whether or not the spectral shape changed between the 2003 and 2009 data sets .",

    ", these count rates can be regarded as upper limits on the intensity of exo 1745248 .",
    "although the low number of photons does not allow detailed spectral analysis , we can obtain some estimates on the x - ray flux that corresponds to these count rates .",

    "assuming that the observed decrease in intensity was completely due to a lower powerlaw normalisation , i.e. , adopting the average spectral shape inferred from the 2003 and 2009 data of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) , we obtain a 0.510 kev flux of @xmath53 for the 2011 data ( cstat=44 for 33 dof ) .",
    "this translates into a luminosity of @xmath54 , which would indicate a drop in intensity by a factor of @xmath55 compared to the 2003 and 2009 observations .",
    "given the hints of spectral variability between the 2003 and 2009 data sets ( sec .",

    "neutron star crust cooling can not be invoked as an explanation for the quiescent variability of exo 1745248 , since its quiescent emission spectrum is fully dominated by hard non - thermal emission .",

    "in particular , it was found that the ratio of the powerlaw to thermal flux remained approximately constant , while the total flux changed by a factor of @xmath143 .",
    "this suggests a direct connection between the two spectral components and led to the interpretation of residual accretion acting in quiescence @xcite .",
    "studies of aql x-1 were not conclusive about which of the spectral components was underlying the observed variability . both accretion onto the neutron star surface with a variable mass - inflow rate , as well as the variable interaction between the pulsar relativistic wind and matter outflowing from the companion star were suggested to explain the observed variability @xcite .",
    "the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ngc 6440 x-1 and sax j1808.43658  both displayed quiescent flux variations by a factor @xmath144 that could be entirely attributed to the powerlaw spectral component @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of exo 1745248  is thus perhaps most reminiscent of these two neutron stars , although its variation in powerlaw flux appears to be stronger ( up to a factor @xmath142 ) .",
    "it is of note that some transient lmxbs harbouring a black hole primary exhibit x - ray intensity variations in their quiescent state that are of similar magnitude as observed for exo 1745248  @xcite .",
    "these systems display pure powerlaw spectra in quiescence , without any thermal emission component .",
    "the mechanism underlying the variations in powerlaw flux seen in black hole lmxbs might also produce the observed variations in the neutron star systems .",
    "this would necessary imply , however , that the powerlaw emission can not be related to any distinctive properties of a neutron star , such as a solid surface and a magnetic field .",
    "accretion is known to cause considerable variability on long timescales , driving the outburst and quiescence cycles of transient lmxbs , as well as on short time scales during outburst episodes",
    ". continued low - level accretion therefore seems an attractive explanation for the observed variability of exo 1745248 .",
    "the source might have been accreting at 0.510 kev luminosities of @xmath145 when it was observed in 2003 and 2009 , while its true quiescent luminosity ( i.e. , the emission level when all accretion activity has ceased ) is lower and possibly represented by the 2011 observations ( @xmath114 , 0.510 kev ) .",
    "however , it may not be straightforward to explain the large and relatively rapid drop in x - ray intensity that occurred between 2009 and 2011 within this framework .",
    "this would require a strong reduction of the accretion flow in the 19 months separating the two observations , while it had restored again only @xmath146  months later when the source exhibited a new accretion outburst ( 2011 late - october ; * ? ? ?",
    "possibly , the non - thermal x - ray emission was not intrinsically reduced but rather obscured during the 2011 observations .",
    "exo 1745248  displayed prominent dipping activity during the first @xmath147 days of its 2000 outburst @xcite . during the dips",
    "the x - ray intensity was reduced by a factor of a few , indicating that the central x - ray source was temporarily obscured , although the dips disappeared and did not return in the second half of the outburst ( altamirano et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the same process may cause obscuration of the x - ray emission in quiescence .",
    "for example , the occurrence of a new outburst of exo 1745248  in late-2011 indicates that there was likely a ( cold ) accretion disk present during the 2011 quiescence observations ( which were separated by @xmath148  days ; see table  [ tab : obs ] ) that may have partly blocked the central x - ray source and hence caused the faded x - ray emission compared to the 2003 and 2009 data .",
    "our colour - intensity study and spectral analysis suggests that the hydrogen column density may have varied between the 2003 and 2009 observations , which could lend support to the presence of an obscuring medium in quiescence .",
    "this interpretation would require the powerlaw emission to be produced close to the central x - ray source .",
    "an origin at the shock front between the pulsar wind and matter flowing out from the companion star would then be less likely than accretion of matter onto the neutron star s magnetic field or surface .",
    "we note that depending on the exact spectral parameters , the decrease in quiescent powerlaw flux might be as large as a factor of @xmath149 ( sec .",
    "[ subsec:2011 ] ) , which would be much stronger than the intensity variations seen during the dipping activity in the 2000 outburst of exo 1745248 .",
    "exo 1745248  adds to the ( growing ) list of neutron star lmxbs that show considerable x - ray variability during quiescence .",
    "_  observations of terzan 5 have been planned for the coming year .",
    "these allow to further study the quiescent properties of exo 1745248  and can potentially shed more light on the nature of its strong quiescent x - ray variability .",
