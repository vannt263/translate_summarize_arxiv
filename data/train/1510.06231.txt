    "over the past 15 years , data has moved from local storage to centralized data warehouses in the cloud .",
    "the accessibility of large amounts of personal data through a public network has given rise to many security and privacy issues  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , such issues have generally been taken seriously .",
    "for example , ethical and legal requirements have been imposed on guaranteeing the confidentiality of medical records  @xcite . however , the implementation of privacy technologies is non - trivial , especially if the data storage has been outsourced to a cloud operator .",
    "sensitive information can often be inferred from simple access patterns either by outsiders or by the operator of the storage .",
    "for example , being able to observe a medical doctor to access the medical record of a patient can leak sensitive information .",
    "therefore , such access patterns should be kept hidden both from outsiders and from the party that is administering the records .",
    "oblivious databases  @xcite and privacy - preserving encrypted filesystems  @xcite are examples of technologies that can be used to hide the access information from the administrator . for such systems ,",
    "the decryption of data is typically handled by a central decryption server .",
    "such systems can be conveniently implemented using _ blind decryption schemes _",
    "blind decryption is a versatile primitive .",
    "it can be used as a building block for many privacy critical applications , such as privacy - preserving payment systems  @xcite , key escrow systems , oblivious transfer protocols  @xcite , privacy - preserving systems for digital rights management  @xcite and private information retrieval  @xcite .",
    "a blind decryption scheme consists of an encryption scheme together with a blind decryption protocol intended to decrypt messages in a privacy - preserving fashion .",
    "the meaning of  blind decryption  can be easily described based on the following scenario depicted in  [ fig : blind_decryption_basic ] .",

    "alice is entitled to choose and decrypt exactly one of those messages .",
    "suppose that the decryption key @xmath2 is stored on a decryption server and alice wishes to have the server decrypt the message for her in such a way that neither the encryptor nor the decryptor learn the message chosen by alice .",
    "there are suggestions for practical blind decryption based on public key cryptography  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to implement the blind decryption functionality with other protocols such as secure multi party computation  @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting schemes would be computationally demanding . for many applications symmetric primitives are sufficient and computationally more efficient .",
    "in addition , they can provide secrecy that is not based on computational assumptions .",
    "oblivious transfer schemes  @xcite deliver the same functionality directly between the sender and the receiver without the decryption server .",
    "however , for noiseless channels , information - theoretically secure oblivious transfer is impossible  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there does not seem to exist blind decryption schemes such that the privacy of the user is based on information - theoretic security .",
    "our work aims to fill this shortage . in this paper",
    ", we give a meaningful definition of perfect secrecy for the blind decryption scenario .",
    "in particular , we formulate perfect secrecy of symmetric blind decryption in a setting where at most one of the participants is maliciously observing but adhering to the protocol .",
    "we also propose a symmetric key blind decryption scheme @xmath9 that satisfies our definition .",
    "the scheme is based on modular arithmetic on a ring @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a prime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : related work ] , we describe work that is related to ours . section  [ sec : preliminaries ] discusses the fundamental definitions and the preliminaries for the rest of the paper . in section  [ sec : perfect secrecy for symmetric blind decryption ]",
    ", we formulate three perfect secrecy properties that the blind decryption scheme needs to satisfy . in section  [ sec : perfectly secure encryption ] , we give a description of a symmetric blind decryption scheme @xmath9 . in section  [ sec :",
    "security of devised scheme ] , we show that the devised scheme satisfies our definition of perfect secrecy . finally , section  [ sec : future work ] considers future work and section  [ sec : conclusion ] provides the conclusion .",
    "chaum was the first to consider blindness in the context of digital signatures and privacy preserving payment systems  @xcite .",
    "he described the first public key blind signature scheme  @xcite by utilizing the properties of rsa encryption  @xcite .",
    "the scheme can be also used for encryption and can be therefore considered as the first blind decryption scheme . in the early articles , blind decryption",
    "is referred to as  blind decoding  .",
    "discrete logarithm based blind signature schemes were suggested in  @xcite .",
    "sakurai and yamane were the first to consider public key blind decryption based on the discrete logarithm problem  @xcite .",
    "their method was based on the elgamal cryptosystem  @xcite and related to the blind signature of camenisch , piveteau and stadler  @xcite .",
    "the method was later applied for the implementation of a key escrow system  @xcite .",
    "mambo , sakurai and okamoto were the first to consider blind decryption that is secure against chosen plaintext attacks by signing the ciphertext messages  @xcite .",
    "the resulting scheme is not capable of public key encryption since a secret signing key is required .",
    "green described the first public key blind decryption scheme  @xcite that is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks ( ind - cca2 ) using bilinear groups .",
    "the security of these constructions has been considered computationally either in the random oracle model  @xcite or using computational indistinguishability and infeasibility assumptions  @xcite .",
    "_ oblivious transfer _ protocols are symmetric primitives that offer functionality similar to blind decryption . for oblivious transfer , there are two participants : a sender and a receiver . for the original definition of oblivious transfer",
    ", the sender transmits a message which the receiver gets with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the sender remains oblivious whether the receiver actually got the message .",
    "this form of oblivious transfer was introduced by rabin  @xcite .",
    "the concept was later extended by even , goldreich and lempel  @xcite . for @xmath11-oblivious transfer",
    ", the receiver can choose one from two messages without the sender knowing which of the messages were chosen .",
    "a related concept that can be considered as a further generalization is _ all - or - nothing disclosure of secrets _",
    "@xcite for which alice is willing to disclose at most one secret from a set to bob without bob learning information about the rest of the secrets .",
    "alice must not learn which secret bob chose .",
    "adaptive queries were considered by naor and pinkas  @xcite .",
    "they also considered active adversaries and provided security definitions relating to the simulatability of the receivers .",
    "camenisch , neven and shelat extended the work of naor and pinkas by defining _",
    "simulatable _ oblivious transfer  @xcite and providing practical constructions for such a scheme .",
    "there are other suggestions for oblivious transfer based on problems in bilinear groups  @xcite , groups of composite order  @xcite and the diffie - hellman problem  @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on computational assumptions .",
    "it is impossible to achieve information - theoretic security for both of the parties using noiseless channels  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible using noisy channels such as discrete memoryless channels  @xcite or a trusted initializer  @xcite .",
    "general _ multiparty computation _ protocols can be also applied to implement blind decryption capabilities .",
    "secure multiparty computation was originally introduced by yao  @xcite for two party case .",
    "the general case for @xmath12 is due to goldreich , micali and wigderson  @xcite .",
    "however , secure multiparty computation protocols are computationally intensive in comparison to pure blind decryption and oblivious transfer .",
    "for the set of integers modulo @xmath13 , we denote @xmath14,[1],\\ldots,[n-1]\\}$ ] and equate a congruence class with its least non - negative representative . that is , we consider @xmath15 . by the notation",
    "@xmath16 we mean the unique @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the uniform distribution on a set @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "if a random variable @xmath21 is uniformly distributed on a set @xmath19 , we denote it by @xmath22 .",
    "when an element @xmath23 is sampled from @xmath20 , we denote it by @xmath24 .      a symmetric encryption scheme @xmath25 with keyspace @xmath26 , plaintext space @xmath27 and ciphertext space @xmath28 consists of three algorithms :    1 .   the key generation algortihm @xmath29 : on input a security parameter @xmath30 , @xmath31 outputs a key @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   the encryption algorithm @xmath33 : on input a key @xmath32 and a message @xmath34 , @xmath35 outputs a ciphertext @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   the decryption algorithm @xmath37 : on input a key @xmath32 and a ciphertext @xmath36 , @xmath38 outputs a message @xmath34 such that @xmath39 .",
    "blind decryption has been considered in the literature for the asymmetric case .",
    "however , in this paper we are interested in the symmetric case which is easily adapted from the asymmetric one  @xcite . a symmetric blind decryption scheme @xmath40 consists of a symmetric encryption scheme @xmath25 and a two - party protocol @xmath41 .",
    "the protocol @xmath41 is conducted between an honest user alice and the decryption server which we shall call the decryptor .",
    "the protocol enables alice , that is in possession of a ciphertext @xmath42 , to finish the protocol with the correct decryption of @xmath42 . as a result of running @xmath41 , alice on input a ciphertext @xmath43 outputs either the message @xmath34 or an error message @xmath44 .",
    "the decryptor , on input the key @xmath32 , outputs nothing or an error message @xmath44 . to be secure , the exchanged messages must not leak information to malicious users ( the _ leak - freeness property _  @xcite ) . the property can be formalized based on computational indistinguishability . for every adversary , there has to be a simulator so that the following two games are well defined .",
    "for the first game , a probabilistic polynomial time ( ppt ) adversary @xmath45 can choose any number @xmath46 of ciphertexts @xmath3 for @xmath47 .",
    "it is then given the correct decryptions by executing @xmath41 with the decryptor . finally , @xmath45 outputs the plaintext message , ciphertext pairs @xmath48 for @xmath47 . for the second game ,",
    "a simulator @xmath49 chooses any number @xmath46 of ciphertexts @xmath3 for @xmath47 . in this game ,",
    "the plaintext messages are obtained by querying a trusted party .",
    "@xmath40 is _ leak - free _ if for every ppt adversary @xmath45 there is a simulator @xmath49 such that for every ppt distinguisher @xmath50 the probability of distinguishing between these two games is negligible  @xcite .",
    "another important property for secure blind decryption is the _",
    "blindness property_. it formalizes the idea that the decryptor must not learn anything about the actual plaintext message .",
    "this can be formalized by giving a ppt algorithm @xmath50 the possibility to choose two ciphertexts @xmath51 and giving it oracle access to two instances of @xmath41 based on these choices .",
    "if the probability of distinguishing these two instances is negligible for every ppt algorithm @xmath50 , then @xmath40 satisfies _ ciphertext blindness_. for a formal and rigorous definition , see for example  @xcite .      the notion of perfect secrecy is due to shannon  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be an encryption scheme with keyspace @xmath26 , plaintext space @xmath27 and ciphertext space @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote a random variable on the keyspace induced by @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath53 satisfies perfect secrecy if for every random variable @xmath54 on the plaintext space , every plaintext @xmath34 and every ciphertext @xmath36 , @xmath55 = \\pr \\left [ m = m \\right].\\ ] ] equivalently , @xmath53 satisfies perfect secrecy if and only if for every random variable @xmath54 on the plaintext space , every plaintext messages @xmath56 and every ciphertext @xmath36 , @xmath57 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\pr \\left [ c = { \\mathsf{enc}}(k , m)| m = m_2 \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "instead of computational indistinguishability , we shall now consider secrecy of symmetric blind decryption based on the information observed by the parties . in the following ,",
    "let @xmath25 together with @xmath41 be a symmetric blind decryption scheme with keyspace @xmath26 , plaintext space @xmath27 and ciphertext space @xmath28 .      for the sake of clarity , we do not consider active adversaries .",
    "we assume that the parties adhere to the blind decryption protocol and only observe the flow of messages ( and possibly deduce information from those messages ) .",
    "active adversaries could , for example , induce errors to the protocol messages .",
    "such adversarial scenarios are left for future work .",
    "in addition , we do not consider the case that the decryptor is colluding with either alice or the encryptor against the other .",
    "such a case is equivalent to the oblivious transfer scenario and information - theoretic security is impossible for noiseless channels  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that such collusion scenarios are important for certain applications and need to be investigated in the future",
    ". we do consider the case that the adversary is impersonating one of the parties which is a paramount requirement for many applications .    for clarity",
    ", we also restrict to the case that alice decrypts a single message @xmath34 .",
    "similar to the one - time pad , we assume that a new key is derived after every decryption .",
    "however , in our case there could be several ciphertexts @xmath58 encrypted under the same key .",
    "nevertheless , once alice has decrypted one of the messages we consider that particular key used and a new key and a new set of ciphertexts is generated .",
    "the scenario is the following .",
    "the encryptor chooses a set of @xmath46 plaintext messages @xmath4 for @xmath47 .",
    "he encrypts those messages under a key @xmath2 to obtain ciphertext messages @xmath59 for @xmath60 that he transmits to alice .",
    "alice chooses one of those messages @xmath3 . to hide the actual ciphertext @xmath3",
    ", we assume that there is a ciphertext transformation space @xmath61 so that alice can derive a related ciphertext message @xmath62 that she transmits to the decryptor .",
    "the decryptor responds with its decryption @xmath63 which alice transforms to the correct plaintext message @xmath4 .",
    "the general scenario has been depicted in  [ fig : general_scenario ] .",
    "the used variables have been collected into table  [ tab : table of symbols ] for easier reference .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : various parameter examples ]",
    "there are two main drawbacks of the construction presented in this paper .",
    "first , we have not considered active adversaries .",
    "similar to the one time pad , we have only considered such adversaries that observe the flow of messages . for practical scenarios , we need to consider adversaries that actively induce errors into the protocol flow .",
    "however , such considerations are most naturally conducted in the computational infeasibility model which has been used , for instance , in  @xcite . in the active adversaries setting , it would also be natural to consider the security of the devised scheme in the framework of computational indistinguishability such that the truly random keys are exchanged with pseudorandom bit strings . in particular , the computationally hard version of our scheme yields efficient practical implementations .",
    "the second drawback is that we have only considered the case of a single malicious party . while it does not make sense to consider a scenario where alice is colluding with the encryptor against the decryptor , the scenario where the encryptor and the decryptor are colluding is an important one . for many scenarios alice can not be certain whether the encryptor and the decryptor are in fact separate entities",
    "however , if they are a single entity , the scenario is identical to oblivious transfer .",
    "we can not achieve information - theoretic security in such a case  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that our construction fails for colluding encryptor and decryptor .",
    "if that is the case , we effectively remove the outer layer of encryption which means that @xmath64 leaks @xmath65 to the adversary . to provide security against colluding encryptor and decryptor",
    ", we would need to detect such collusion or to turn to computational assumptions .",
    "we leave the question as an open problem for future research .    another interesting question for future",
    "work is to consider the case where we do not apply the outer layer of encryption from the encryptor to alice .",
    "thus far , we have defined perfect blindness so that the decryptor has absolutely no information about the plaintext message .",
    "however , we could relax the requirement so that  similar to leak - freeness against the encryptor ",
    "the information is conditioned on the plaintexts @xmath66 . in other words",
    ", we could relax the requirement so that the decryptor may observe the selection ( and the corresponding plaintext messages ) given to alice .",
    "such a relaxation is natural in the oblivious transfer case where the encryptor and the decryptor are the same entity .",
    "we could then define blindness as a property requiring only that the selection @xmath65 is hidden .",
    "it is again easy to see that our scheme without the outer layer of encryption fails such a property . if @xmath58 are not protected , then @xmath64 leaks the selection @xmath65 .",
    "we leave this consideration also for future work .",
    "in this paper , we give a definition of perfect secrecy for symmetric blind decryption in the setting where one of the parties may be malicious but adhering to the protocol of the scheme .",
    "we neither consider active adversaries nor the setting where two of the participants are colluding against the third .",
    "we construct a symmetric blind decryption scheme @xmath9 and show that it satisfies our definition of perfect secrecy .",
    "the scheme is based on two layers of encryption , where the inner layer utilizes a novel encryption scheme @xmath67 given in this paper .",
    "@xmath67 is based on modular arithmetic with @xmath0 as the ciphertext space , @xmath68 as the plaintext space and @xmath69 as the key space , where @xmath70 is a prime .",
    "the security of @xmath9 is shown information theoretically and does not depend on the size of @xmath1 . for a fixed blind decryption key , @xmath9 supports a single blind decryption from a selection of @xmath71 messages . for a single decryption of a message of bit length @xmath72 , the decryption server needs to store key material of @xmath73 bits .",

    "<S> a blind decryption scheme enables a user to query decryptions from a decryption server without revealing information about the plaintext message . </S>",
    "<S> such schemes are useful , for example , for the implementation of privacy preserving encrypted file storages and payment systems . in terms of functionality , </S>",
    "<S> blind decryption is close to oblivious transfer . for noiseless channels , </S>",
    "<S> information - theoretically secure oblivious transfer is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this paper we show that this is not the case for blind decryption . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a definition of perfect secrecy of symmetric blind decryption for the following setting : at most one of the scheme participants is a malicious observer . </S>",
    "<S> we also devise a symmetric blind decryption scheme based on modular arithmetic on a ring @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a prime , and show that it satisfies our notion of perfect secrecy .    communication system security , cryptography , encryption , information security </S>"
