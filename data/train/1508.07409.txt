    "eruptive solar filaments and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) often exhibit a clear helical geometry ( about 40% for cmes ; vourlidas _ et al . _ , 2012 ) , indicating the eruption of a magnetic flux rope .",
    "a magnetic flux rope becomes kink - unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value of 2.5@xmath0@xmath13.5@xmath0 ( hood and priest , 1981 ; fan , 2005 ; trk and kliem , 2005 ) .",
    "then the axis of the flux rope undergoes writhing motions , and the twist is transformed into the writhe of the axis , since the magnetic helicity is essentially conserved ( ji _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; rust and labonte , 2005 )",
    ". the kink instability can initiate the rise motion of the flux rope and is considered as one type of mechanism that triggers the cme and associated activities ( trk and kliem , 2003 ; liu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; yan _ et al . _ , 2014 )",
    ".    however , a basic question about the formation of the flux rope is not well understood .",
    "some theoretical models suggest that the flux rope is formed through magnetic reconnection , which converts sheared arcades into a helical structure ( pneuman , 1983 ; van ballegooijen and martens , 1989 ) .",
    "( 2014a ) showed an example of compound flux rope formation via merging of two different flux ropes , consistent with the tether cutting magnetic reconnection scenario ( moore _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "( 2014 ) suggested that magnetic reconnection was responsible for the formation of a double - decker magnetic flux rope .",
    "another possibility is the emergence of the flux rope from below the photosphere into the corona . the helical structure is formed deep in the convection zone before its emergence ( rust and kumar , 1994 ; lites , 2005 ) .",
    "( 2008 ) analyzed the vector magnetic fields on the photosphere under a filament and concluded that a helical flux rope was emerging from below the photosphere .",
    "based on the nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) extrapolation technique , guo _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 ) and canou and amari ( 2010 ) showed the presence of twisted flux ropes and found that the location of the magnetic dips within the flux ropes agrees with the observed filament in h@xmath5 images .",
    "moreover , the formation and eruption of flux ropes have been simulated by many authors ( fan and gibson , 2004 ; amari _ et al . _ , 2010 ) .",
    "( 2010 ) carried out the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation and found that the photospheric flux - cancellations in a bald - patch separatrix and tether - cutting coronal reconnection are key mechanisms for the formation of flux ropes .",
    "recently , the direct observations of flux ropes in the low corona have been reported ( li and zhang , 2013a , 2013c , 2014 ; chen _ et al .",

    "( 2010 ) presented a successive activation of magnetic flux ropes in chromospheric and euv lines and concluded that such activation plays an important role in triggering the flare .",

    ", the filament was activated and then it could be clearly observed at 304  .",
    "the associated euv brightenings appeared at the west of the filament and increased until 12:27 ut ( figures 1(e)-(f ) ; movies in 304  and 171  are available as electronic supplementary materials ) .",
    "the eruptive material moved northward with a velocity of about 100 km s@xmath2 , and the northern part of the filament showed an evident counterclockwise rotation around the filament axis ( figures 1(g)-(i ) ) .",
    "the filament was not clearly observed in h@xmath5 images during the eruption process .",
    "this might be caused by the heating of the filament material . until 12:43 ut",
    ", the filament material was cooled and thus the filament appeared again in h@xmath5 images ( figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "starting from about 08:00 ut , magnetic flux cancellation constantly took place underlying the northern part of the filament ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the temporal variations of the cancelling magnetic flux in hmi magnetograms were measured and are displayed in figure 2(g ) .",
    "we derotated all the magnetograms differentially to a reference time ( 11:10 ut ) .",
    "the area in which we calculated the magnetic flux is the blue circle in figures 2(c)-(f ) .",
    "after selection , the pixels with magnetic fields weaker than 10.2 gauss ( g ) ( the noise level determined by liu _",
    "et al . _ , 2012 ) are eliminated .",
    "the temporal profiles of positive and negative magnetic flux show a consistent decreasing trend .",
    "the total magnetic flux decreased from 4.8@xmath810@xmath9 maxwell ( mx ) at 07:54 ut to 2.5@xmath810@xmath9 mx at 12:55 ut .",
    "the average rate of flux cancellation was approximately 1.3@xmath810@xmath10 mx s@xmath2 . at 12:21 ut ,",
    "the initial euv brightening was observed at the location of the cancelled flux and the filament started to erupt ( figure 2(b ) ) .    to reveal the rotation of the northern filament more clearly",
    ", we tracked three moving features (  f1\"@xmath1f3 \" in figure 3(b ) ) between 12:36 ut to 12:46 ut .",
    "as an example , the evolution of  f1 \" was shown in figures 3(c)-(g ) , exhibiting a helical upward motion .",
    "each track of moving features from the eastern edge to the west corresponds to a rotation angle of about @xmath0 , and thus the total twist angle was approximately 3@xmath0 in about 10 min .",
    "the average angular speed of the rotating plasma was about 15.7@xmath810@xmath11 rad s@xmath2 .",
    "the filament material ultimately fell back to its initial location from 12:50 ut , and the eruption was failed .",
    "the southern part of the filament showed an obvious helical evolution during the eruption process ( figure 4 ) . before the appearance of euv brightening , the southern filament looked linear and showed no helical shape ( figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "afterwards , it was activated and the helical structure gradually appeared ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "after 12:35 ut , the southern filament showed a rotation motion in the counterclockwise direction ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "iris observations showed that a flux rope with a helical shape appeared at the site of the southern filament ( panels ( e)-(f ) ) .",
    "the comparison of the hmi magnetogram with the 1330  image shows that the southern end of the flux rope was rooted in the negative polarity fields of the ar ( panels ( f)-(g ) ) . in order to compare the multi - wavelength appearances of the flux rope and filament material , the intensity plots along the cuts",
    " a@xmath1b \" and  c@xmath1d \" ( red straight lines in panels ( b ) and ( f ) ) at 12:31:48 ut are presented in the bottom panels of figure 4 .",
    "all the cuts along slice  a@xmath1b \" showed a strongest emission at about 5 mm ( first peak in panel ( d ) ) .",
    "the emission of 1330  had a secondary peak at about 7.5 mm ( gray section in panel ( d ) ) . however",
    ", the cuts of 304  and 171  show much weaker emissions at about 7.5 mm . in the 1330  cut along slice",
    " c@xmath1d \" , the section corresponding to the filament material , _",
    "i.e. _ , the gray section in panel ( h ) , showed an intensity enhancement while in the 304  and 171  cuts , there was a significantly lower emission at the corresponding section .",
    "this indicates a striking anti - correlation between the 1330  and euv line intensities at the location of the filament , _",
    "i.e. _ , peaks of the former correspond to minimum of the latter .      starting from about 12:20 ut ,",
    "the erupting material of the filament gradually moved southwardly and tracked out bright fine - scale features ( figures 5(a)-(b ) ; a movie is available as electronic supplementary materials ) . at 12:28 ut",
    ", the initial flux rope looked like a funnel and the kink could not be clearly observed ( figure 5(b ) ) .",
    "subsequently , the fine threads were tangled and intertwined with each other .",
    "two individual threads were selected to estimate the twist of the flux rope and they showed crossing several times in an image ( red and blue dashed curves in figure 5(c ) ) .",
    "we estimated the amount of twist was about 4@xmath0 according to the geometry of the threads ( panels ( c)-(d ) ) . at 12:32 ut",
    ", the bright plasma arrived at the southern end of the flux rope and illuminated the whole flux rope ( panel ( e ) ) .",
    "the same amount of twist of about 4@xmath0 was visible at this time from the southern footpoint up to the northern part .",
    "the length of the visible flux rope was approximately 40@xmath3 .",
    "the flux rope was not stable and underwent a counterclockwise rotation around its main axis after 12:35 ut ( figure 5(f ) ) .",
    "initially intertwined strands began to untangle and the morphology of the flux rope was changed evidently .",
    "the rotation of the flux rope was obviously the unwinding motion of the twisted magnetic field lines , consistent with the rotation direction of the filament ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "associated with the unwinding motion , the flux rope finally evolved into a  net - like cylinder \" ( panel ( g ) ) , with the southern leg slightly thinner than top parts .",
    "the two zoomed images at 12:30 ut and 12:41 ut ( panels ( d ) and ( h ) ) clearly showed the twisted threads of the flux rope .",
    "later on , the intensity of the flux rope decreased and the flux rope became invisible after 12:48 ut .",
    "figure 6 shows the line profile ( c ii 1335.71  ) evolution at different points ( locations  a\"@xmath1d \" in figure 5(f ) ) along the slit .",
    "the slit was located at the southern leg of the flux rope in the sjis ( figure 5 ) . in the wavelength range of 1335.14@xmath11336.44  ,",
    "the line profiles mainly show two peaks at 1335.71  and 1335.86  .",
    "the emissions at locations  a \" and  b \" between 12:30:47 ut and 12:35:29 ut were relatively weak , compared to those at locations ",
    "c \" and  d \" . by checking the sjis",
    ", we suggest that the weak line profiles of  a \" and  b \" in the early stage mostly came from the background plasma , and the emissions of southern locations  c \" and  d \" were from the plasma of the flux rope .",
    "associated with the gradual expansion of the flux rope , the emission intensity of northern locations  a \" and  b \" increased between 12:37:03 ut and 12:40:11 ut due to the appearance of the flux rope at these locations .    at 12:37:03 ut , the line profile of location  a \" showed a redshift of about 6 km s@xmath2 ( panel ( a ) ) .",
    "then the doppler velocity increased to 24 km s@xmath2 about 3 min later . at 12:40:11 ut , the redshifts at locations ",
    "b\"@xmath1d \" were also observed with doppler velocity of 6@xmath112 km s@xmath2 ( panels ( b)-(d ) ) , smaller than that of  a \" .",
    "moreover , the line profile of location  b \" at 12:37:03 ut showed a blue - wing excess ( panel ( b ) ) , and the minor component contributing about 20% to the total emission .",
    "the wing excess corresponded to a strong blueshift of up to 44 km s@xmath2 ( peter , 2010 ) . by investigating the sjis , we found a jet - like activity occurred between 12:35:10 ut and 12:37:59 ut . the plasma from the jet possibly accounted for the blueshift at location  b \" . for the line profile of location  c \" at 12:37:03 ut , the emission intensity rapidly increased to 200% of the peak intensity at 12:35:29 ut ( blue line in panel ( c ) ) .",
    "meanwhile , the line width increased evidently .",
    "this might be caused by the transient heating process of the local plasma .",
    "the morphology of the flux rope reminded us of a cme on 2 june 1998 . in lasco",
    "/ c2 observations , the cme core was composed of many fine - scale structures , which were crossed and tangled with each other ( figure 7(a ) ) . the cme core had a cylindrical shape with helical field lines wrapping around it ( figures 7(b ) and ( c ) ) , similar to the shape of the flux rope ( figure 7(d ) ) . however , the scales of the cme core and the flux rope were greatly different .",
    "the cme core had a width of 1480@xmath3 ( green arrows in figure 7(c ) ) , equal to 1.54 @xmath4 .",
    "the width of the flux rope was approximately 8.3@xmath3 ( green arrows in figure 7(d ) ) .",
    "we also measured the widths of fine structures ( slices  s1 \" for the cme core and  s2 \" for the flux rope in figures 7(c)-(d ) ) by using gaussian function to fit the intensity profiles .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhw ) of the gaussian fitting profile was thought to be the width of fine - scale structure .",
    "the fine structure of the cme core had a width of 37.5@xmath3 ( figure 7(e ) ) , about 4.5 times of the width of the entire flux rope ( 8.3@xmath3 ) .",
    "the fine structure of the flux rope was only 0.7@xmath3 wide , nearly 4 pixels of iris images .",
    "we report the observations of a flux rope at tr temperatures made by iris on 30 august 2014 nearby ar 12149 .",
    "the flux rope was located at the southern part of an erupting filament based on the sdo observations . initially magnetic flux cancellation and",
    "obvious euv brightenings were observed .",
    "then the filament was activated and the bright material moved southward and filled in the body of the flux rope observed at 1330  .",
    "the fine structures of the flux rope were tangled with each other , and the total twist was estimated to be almost 4@xmath0 .",
    "afterwards , the flux rope exhibited a counterclockwise unwinding motion ( when viewed top - down ) around its main axis .",
    "spectral observations displayed that the redshifts from several to more than 20 km s@xmath2 appeared at the southern leg of the flux rope in the late stage .",
    "the flux rope showed a helical structure , similar to the cme core of 2 june 1998 .",
    "however , the spatial scales of the flux rope and the cme core are greatly different .    magnetic flux cancellation constantly occurred in about 5 h before the appearance of the flux rope .",
    "we suggest that the magnetic flux cancellation initiated reconnection and some activation of the flux rope .",
    "the obvious euv brightenings indicate that heating took place during the filament eruption .",
    "the heated plasma from the filament moved towards its southern end and illuminated the flux rope body in the 1330  channel .",
    "thus the twisted structures of the flux rope were tracked out by filling it with hot and dense plasma .",
    "we suggest that part of the magnetic flux rope structures may exist in the space filled in by the flux ropes before the appearance of the flux rope .",
    "this is similar to the observations of raouafi ( 2009 ) and li and zhang ( 2013b ) , who reported the brightening of flux ropes and the appearance of the fine structures due to the nearby flares or other activities .",
    "the filament material showed the counterclockwise rotation motion along the helical flux rope structures in the late stage . the total twist ( 4@xmath0 ) of the flux rope",
    "is above the critical value ( 2.5@xmath0@xmath13.5@xmath0 ; hood and priest , 1981 ) , which indicates that kink instability possibly took place in this event .",
    "the rotation was obviously the unwinding motion of the twisted magnetic field lines .",
    "the stored twist and magnetic helicity of the flux rope were possibly transported to the ambient open fields ( liu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ; chen _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; zhang _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) .",
    "the average angular speed ( 15.7@xmath810@xmath11 rad s@xmath2 ) of the flux rope is comparable to that of the unwinding jet ( 11.1@xmath810@xmath11 rad s@xmath2 ) presented by shen _",
    "( 2012 ) reported the twist of an eruptive filament by 6@xmath0 and suggested that kink instability played a key role in the filament eruption .",
    "the iris slit covered the fine - scale structures at the western side of the axis and the line profiles of c ii at these locations were mostly redshifted .",
    "the spectroscopic results are consistent with the above inferred counter - clockwise rotations , with dominant redshifts on the west .",
    "the redshifts at the northern locations are larger than the south ( in positions  a \" and  d \" )",
    ". there might be two reasons to explain the difference in the redshifts .",
    "the southern locations were near to the footpoints of the flux rope and had a smaller rotating radius .",
    "moreover , the doppler shifts at different locations along the same helical structure are different due to the projection effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , the points at the edge of the helical structure had the largest doppler shifts and the points in the middle had the lower velocities .",
    "( 2014 ) revealed the opposite doppler velocities of @xmath7 5 km s@xmath2 at the two sides of the prominence , indicating the rotational motion of the magnetic structures in tornado - like prominences .",
    "( 2015 ) investigated an eruptive prominence by using iris observations and found the blue to redshift transition with height and sinusoidal spectral variations along the slit during the counter - clockwise unwinding motions .",
    "the small - scale flux rope ( width of 8.3@xmath3 ) and the large - scale cme core ( width of 1.54 @xmath4 ) on 2 june 1998 both showed a helical structure .",
    "they look very similar possibly because of low optical density , and the fine - scale structures at both sides of the flux rope are visible . this similarity shows the presence of flux ropes of different scales on the sun .",
    "the fine structure of the flux rope is about 0.7@xmath3 wide , similar to the previous results .",
    "li and zhang ( 2013b ) showed that the flux ropes in euv wavelengths are composed of about 100 fine - scale structures , with an average width of about 1.6@xmath3 .",

    "<S> we report the observations of a flux rope at transition region temperatures with the _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( iris ) on 30 august 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> initially , magnetic flux cancellation constantly took place and a filament was activated . </S>",
    "<S> then the bright material from the filament moved southward and tracked out several fine structures . </S>",
    "<S> these fine structures were twisted and tangled with each other , and appeared as a small flux rope at 1330  , with a total twist of about 4@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , the flux rope underwent a counter - clockwise ( viewed top - down ) unwinding motion around its axis . </S>",
    "<S> spectral observations of c ii 1335.71  at the southern leg of the flux rope showed that doppler redshifts of 6@xmath124 km s@xmath2 appeared at the western side of the axis , which is consistent with the counter - clockwise rotation motion . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the magnetic flux cancellation initiates reconnection and some activation of the flux rope . </S>",
    "<S> the stored twist and magnetic helicity of the flux rope are transported into the upper atmosphere by the unwinding motion in the late stage . the small - scale flux rope ( width of 8.3@xmath3 ) had a cylindrical shape with helical field lines , similar to the morphology of the large - scale cme core ( width of 1.54 @xmath4 ) on 2 june 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity shows the presence of flux ropes of different scales on the sun . </S>"
