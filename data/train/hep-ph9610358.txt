    "the search for weak scale supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite forms an integral part of the experimental program @xcite at all high energy colliders in operation or in the construction and planning phases . in the absence of any one compelling theoretical framework ,",
    "the experimental analyses have to be performed within the context of particular models . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is obtained by the direct supersymmetrization of the standard model ( sm ) , but with two higgs doublets , and including all renormalizable soft supersymmetry breaking interactions consistent with sm symmetries .",
    "the resulting theory has over one hundred model parameters making phenomenological analyses intractable .",
    "( if @xmath4-parity violation by renormalizable baryon- ( or lepton- ) number violating superpotential interactions is allowed , the number of model parameters is even larger . ) the proliferation of soft - susy breaking parameters is a reflection of our lack of understanding of the mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "the practical solution for reducing the parameter - space is to incorporate simplifying ansatze usually based on the assumed symmetries of physics at very high scales .",
    "one especially attractive and economic realization of this idea is provided by the so - called minimal supergravity ( msugra ) framework @xcite that has been recently used for most phenomenological @xcite , and also some experimental @xcite , analyses of susy",
    ". here , `` minimal '' refers in part to the technical assumption of canonical kinetic energy terms .",
    "it is envisioned that susy is dynamically broken at a scale @xmath5 in a sector of the theory that interacts with the observable sector of quarks , leptons , gauge and higgs bosons and their superpartners only via gravity , which acts as the `` messenger '' of supersymmetry breaking@xcite . as a result the particle - sparticle mass gap in the observable sector is suppressed by @xmath6 relative to @xmath5 and is thus given by @xmath7 .",
    "this quantity may be of order the weak scale if @xmath5 is @xmath8  gev , where the reduced planck mass @xmath9  gev .",
    "the goldstone fermion ( which dominantly lives in the hidden sector ) then forms the longitudinal components of the gravitino which generically acquires a mass @xmath7 by the super - higgs mechanism@xcite .",
    "although a weak scale particle , the couplings of the gravitino are of gravitational strength , so that it plays no role in particle physics .",
    "the resulting low energy lagrangian@xcite in the observable sector is just a globally supersymmetric lagrangian with universal scalar ( @xmath10 ) and gaugino masses ( @xmath11 ) and a universal trilinear scalar soft - susy breaking parameter ( @xmath12 ) at an ultra - high scale @xmath13 often identified with @xmath14 .",
    "the universality of the gauginos may have its origins in grand unification while the universal boundary condition for the scalar masses results from our technical assumption of the canonical kinetic energy terms , mentioned above . although these boundary conditions are _ not _ generic @xcite to supergravity models ( and are tantamount to assuming an additional global symmetry known to be broken by yukawa interactions ) this framework is generally referred to as the minimal sugra framework .",
    "a very attractive feature of this picture is that over a significant portion of the parameter space of the model , radiative corrections lead to the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite ; the susy higgs mass parameter @xmath15 is then fixed by the value of @xmath16 .",
    "in such a scenario , all the sparticle properties are determined by just four additional parameters along with @xmath17 .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is frequently the lightest neutralino ( @xmath18 ) and is a good candidate for cosmological cold dark matter if @xmath4-parity is conserved as is assumed to be the case@xcite .",
    "attractive though this framework is , it says nothing about the dynamics of susy breaking . in recent studies ,",
    "dine , nelson , nir and shirman@xcite have attempted to construct models where susy is dynamically broken in the hidden sector of the theory and communicated to a messenger sector via new gauge interactions .",
    "the messenger sector , which is characterized by a mass scale @xmath19 , interacts with the observable sector via the known sm gauge interactions which then serve to communicate susy breaking to the visible sector quarks , leptons , gauge and higgs bosons , and their superpartners .",
    "the effective susy breaking scale in the observable sector is now suppressed by @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 and is @xmath21 , with @xmath5 being the induced susy breaking scale in the messenger sector and @xmath22 is the relevant sm fine structure constant .",
    "the effective scale of susy breaking in the observable sector may thus be @xmath23 even if the susy breaking scale and the messenger scale m are as small as few tens or few hundred tev .",
    "the gravitino mass , which is still suppressed by @xmath20 , is smaller by a factor @xmath24 compared to @xmath25 within the sugra framework for @xmath26  tev .",
    "thus in these new scenarios , the gravitino mass may be in the electron - volt range .",
    "fayet@xcite has shown that for the longitudinal components of such a superlight gravitino the smallness of the gravitational coupling is made up by the size of the wavefunction of the gravitino of electroweak scale energy so that this gravitino does _ not _ decouple from other particles .",
    "the fact that the gravitino , and not the lightest neutralino , is the lsp is the main reason why the phenomenology of these models can be quite different@xcite from the usual mssm analyses .",
    "most importantly , the lightest neutralino ( as well as other neutralinos ) can now decay via @xmath27 , and also via @xmath28 or @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 or @xmath31 for light , heavy and pseudoscalar higgs bosons ) if the decays are kinematically allowed .",
    "we will see that for sparticle masses accessible at the tevatron , the photon decay dominates over much of the parameter space of the model .",
    "since the gravitino escapes experimental detection , we expect that in such a scenario susy events will generically have the @xmath32-jet(s)@xmath33-lepton(s)@xmath34- @xmath35 topology .",
    "we find that the branching ratio for sparticles other than @xmath18 to decay via the gravitino mode is small , so that @xmath36 because the photon detection efficiency is not unity .",
    "this novel source of photons in susy events was considered@xcite to be the origin of the single @xmath37 event@xcite recorded by the cdf collaboration .",
    "finally , we will show that at least within the simplest of the gauge mediated low energy susy breaking ( gmlesb ) models reviewed in the next section , there would have been a plethora of other events accompanying the cdf event , making its susy origin within this context rather implausible .",
    "the scenarios envisioned in ref.@xcite are in a sense considerably more ambitious than the conventional sugra picture since they include not only a mechanism for the transmission of susy breaking , but also the dynamical mechanism for it .",
    "thus , all scales in the low energy theory , in particular the values of @xmath38 and the susy breaking higgs boson mass parameters that describes the observable sector , should be derived in such a scenario .",
    "since there is no universally accepted resolution of the @xmath38 problem @xcite , we will adopt a phenomenological approach and focus on the implications of the gmlesb model , treating @xmath38 to be a parameter that gets fixed by the value of @xmath16 via the constraint from radiative electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "in other words , we regard the mediation of susy breaking and the mechanism of susy breaking as independent issues , with independent consequences .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the assumptions underlying the gmlesb model and set up the parameter space for our phenomenological analysis .",
    "we delineate the regions of parameter space already excluded by experiments at lep2 and the measurement of the @xmath0 branching ratio by the cleo collaboration .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "ii we study the branching fractions for the direct decays of sparticles to gravitinos which is the novel feature of these scenarios . in section  iii ,",
    "we use isajet @xcite to generate events which lead to the various @xmath39 event topologies at the fermilab tevatron and give an estimate of its reach in various channels from the data of run i as well as from run  ii with the main injector and the proposed @xcite tev33 upgrade .",
    "we summarize our results in section  iv .",
    "supersymmetry is dynamically broken in the `` secluded sector '' ( this was referred to as the hidden sector in the sugra framework ) of the theory and communicated to the `` messenger sector '' via some new gauge interactions which do not couple to the known particles . in the simplest realization of this idea@xcite the messenger sector is weakly coupled @xcite ( so that non - perturbative dynamics does not cause susy breaking via gaugino masses ) and comprises of one set of `` quark '' and `` lepton '' superfields in a @xmath40 representation of @xmath41 coupled to a singlet via a superpotential of the form @xmath42 .",
    "the incorporation of new fields in complete gut multiplets ensures that they do not spoil the successful prediction of @xmath43 if this model is incorporated into a gut .",
    "the scalar and auxilliary components of the field @xmath44 acquire vacuum expectation values , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the latter signalling the breaking of susy in the messenger sector .",
    "sm gauge interactions then carry the information of susy breaking to the observable sector , and induce masses ( proportional to the corresponding fine structure constant ) for the gauginos via one loop quantum corrections .",
    "the chiral scalars feel the effect of susy breaking only via these gaugino masses , so that susy breaking scalar squared masses are induced only as two loop effects . if @xmath47 , the gaugino and scalar masses are respectively given by@xcite , @xmath48 and @xmath49,\\ ] ] with @xmath50 , and @xmath51 given in terms of the usual hypercharge coupling @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "finally , @xmath54 for colour triplets and zero for colour singlets while @xmath55 for weak doublets and zero for weak singlets .",
    "these relations , which are independent of the messenger sector superpotential couplings @xmath56 , get corrections of @xmath57 which are ignored in the subsequent analysis .",
    "notice that instead of a universal scalar mass as in sugra , the masses of the scalars in this model depend on their gauge quantum numbers : squarks are the heaviest , followed by uncoloured electroweak doublets , followed by the colour and electroweak singlets . since the gaugino masses are radiatively generated@xcite , the mass relation is exactly as in a gut model , although the physics behind this is very different .",
    "susy breaking @xmath58-parameters and the @xmath59-parameter are induced only at higher loops so that it is reasonable to suppose that these are small .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath38 parameter is not determined by how susy breaking is mediated but will be fixed ( up to a sign ) by the constraints of radiative symmetry breaking as in the sugra framework . a complete theory that includes the dynamics of susy breaking",
    "will presumably yield a value of @xmath38 consistent with this .",
    "( 2.1 ) and eq . ( 2.2 ) should be regarded as boundary conditions for the gaugino and scalar masses valid at the messenger scale @xmath60 ( we assume @xmath61 ) , so that these parameters need to be evolved down to the weak scale relevant for phenomenological analysis . the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) of various susy breaking gaugino and scalar masses",
    "is illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", assuming the boundary conditions discussed above .",
    "in this example we have chosen @xmath62  tev , @xmath63  gev , @xmath64 and taken @xmath65 .",
    "the top mass is fixed to @xmath66  gev throughout this paper . as expected the squarks , on account of their qcd interactions ,",
    "are significantly heavier than all the other scalars .",
    "the susy breaking @xmath67-squark masses are smaller than those for other squarks on account of their large yukawa interactions which reduce their masses as q is evolved down to the weak scale .",
    "the right - handed sleptons which have only hypercharge gauge interactions are considerably lighter than the left - handed slepton or higgs doublets . finally , the running gaugino masses are proportional to the corresponding fine structure constants at all scales . the most important feature of fig .",
    "1 is that @xmath68 becomes negative and electroweak symmetry is radiatively broken just as in sugra models .",
    "then , we can eliminate the weak scale @xmath59-parameter in favour of @xmath69 ( we will return to the issue of whether the resulting value of @xmath59 evolved to the scale m is compatible with the expectation from the boundary condition ) while @xmath15 is determined by @xmath70 . in doing so",
    ", we have minimized the one - loop corrected effective potential .",
    "the model is thus completely specified by the parameter set ( @xmath1 , @xmath69 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath19 is presumably logarithmic since it only enters via the boundary conditions , so that the @xmath71 plane provides a convenient arena for presenting our results .",
    "we begin by showing contours of various sparticle masses and the weak scale susy parameters @xmath72 and @xmath38 in the @xmath71 plane for the two signs of @xmath38 .",
    "we show contours of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in fig .",
    "2_a _ for @xmath65 and fig .",
    "2_b _ for @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "2_c _ and fig .",
    "2_d _ we show contours for @xmath78 and @xmath79 in addition to contours for @xmath72 and @xmath38 for the two signs of @xmath38 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath19=500  tev .",
    "the region in fig .",
    "2 denoted by bricks is where the proper breaking of electroweak symmetry is not obtained .",
    "the hatched region is where the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath80  gev or @xmath81  gev .",
    "the latter bound has recently been obtained by the aleph collaboration at lep2 @xcite .",
    "the chargino bound is derived assuming that the chargino is gaugino - like with @xmath82  gev , and further that the @xmath18 escapes detection .",
    "although no analyses have been specifically carried out for the gmlesb scenario , the clean experimental environment makes it difficult to imagine that these chargino signals would have evaded detection even if @xmath18 were unstable and decayed within the detector via @xmath27 .",
    "the lep limit of @xmath83  gev has been obtained for a sm higgs boson ; our corresponding requirement of @xmath84 gev for the light mssm higgs boson should be an excellent approximation for the gmlesb framework since the additional higgs bosons are all comparatively heavy ( see below ) .",
    "the cross - hatched region at large @xmath69 is where @xmath85 ( recall that @xmath86 mixing can be substantial for large values of @xmath69 ) .",
    "while this last region would have been excluded by cosmological considerations within the msugra framework , this is not so for the gmlesb model since the @xmath87 is unstable . indeed ,",
    "if the model parameters are in the cross - hatched region the phenomenology will be quite different .",
    "charginos and neutralinos ( including @xmath18 ) will cascade decay to @xmath87 which will then decay via @xmath88 with a width ( independent of stau mixing ) given by @xmath89 which yields a decay length of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , for this region of parameters , every susy event will contain 2 - 4 @xmath91 s in the final state instead of hard isolated photons .",
    "we will not elaborate this scenario any further .",
    "the following features of fig .",
    "2 are worth noting .",
    "* the scale of sparticle masses is set by @xmath1 .",
    "except for the cross hatched region , @xmath18 is the next - to - lightest sparticle ( nlsp ) , and further , except for @xmath69 close to unity , sparticle masses are insensitive to @xmath69 . * the left - handed sleptons ( and sneutrinos ) are substantially heavier than @xmath92 ; squarks are generally heavier than gluinos except for third generation squarks which have substantial yukawa interactions ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ratio @xmath93 , ( at the scale @xmath19 ) decreases as the square root of the number of @xmath41 vector multiplets in the messenger sector@xcite , and can go below unity .",
    "if the number of messenger sector fields is large , this will effect the phenomenology which is sensitive to whether squarks are decaying into gluinos or vice - versa .",
    "a similar comment applies to slepton and electroweak gaugino masses . *",
    "the value of @xmath38 which is obtained from radiative symmetry breaking is large so that the lighter chargino and the two lightest neutralinos are gaugino - like , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 contain large higgsino components .",
    "thus the chargino and neutralino mass and mixing patterns are qualitatively similar to those in the msugra model .",
    "* even though we start with @xmath96 , an @xmath58-parameter of several hundred gev is generated by the renormalization group running : since @xmath38 , @xmath72 and @xmath97 have comparable magnitudes , there is considerable mixing in the @xmath67-squark sector . *",
    "although we have not shown this , all but the lightest of the neutral higgs scalars tend to be heavy .",
    "we have checked that these are always heavier than 180  gev , and frequently much heavier .",
    "again , this feature is common with the msugra model .",
    "of course , the higgs sector may be sensitive to any refinements designed to solve the `` @xmath38 problem '' .",
    "the cleo collaboration @xcite has quoted the 95% cl range @xmath98 from their study of inclusive flavour changing neutral current decays of @xmath59-mesons .",
    "such low energy measurements provide constraints on any particular model framework where virtual effects of new particles can contribute to the decay .",
    "we have used the recent analysis described in ref.@xcite to compute this branching fraction within the gmlesb framework .",
    "the result of this computation is illustrated in the @xmath71 plane in fig .  3 for ( _ a _ )",
    "@xmath65 , and ( _ b _ ) @xmath77 .",
    "again , we have fixed @xmath63  tev .",
    "this constraint excludes a substantial region of the parameter space for negative @xmath38 due to constructive interference amongst the various susy and sm loop contributions .",
    "the cleo experiment poses no constraint for @xmath99 , since in this case the various susy loops contributions interfere destructively .",
    "the rate for @xmath100 could be sensitive to the modifications of the higgs sector arising from new dynamics included to generate @xmath38 dynamically .",
    "for this reason , in sec .",
    "iii we include in our study parameter space points for which this @xmath0 constraint is not satisfied .    before turning to phenomenology",
    ", we note that the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking determine @xcite the weak scale @xmath59 in terms of @xmath69 ( while @xmath38 is fixed by the value of @xmath16 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath59 can then be evolved to @xmath101 , its value at the messenger scale @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath101 is not generated at one loop , we expect that it should be small within our framework .",
    "contours of @xmath101 are shown in the @xmath71 plane in fig .",
    "4 for ( _ a _ )",
    "@xmath65 , and ( _ b _ )  @xmath77 .",
    "we see that for positive values of @xmath38 , @xmath101 is always very large . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a region of parameter space with @xmath65 where @xmath101 is close to zero .",
    "if we take the model literally , we would conclude that @xmath69 is fixed to be between 20 and 30 , depending on the value of @xmath1 and @xmath65 . while this might be interesting in itself , this conclusion",
    "would probably be altered by the addition of new interactions that would be necessary to generate @xmath38 dynamically .",
    "for this reason we will remain agnostic about @xmath69 and @xmath17 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we have seen that below the scale @xmath19 , the gmlesb model looks just like the minimal supersymmetric model with ( correlated ) soft supersymmetry breaking terms , together with a very light gravitino as the lsp .",
    "the nlsp , which is usually the @xmath18 , thus decays via @xmath102 and also via @xmath103 and @xmath104 if these decays are kinematically allowed .",
    "expressions for these decay rates are given in ambrosanio _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the branching fractions for the various decays are shown versus @xmath1 in fig .  5 for ( _ a _ )",
    "@xmath105 , ( _ b _ )  @xmath106 , ( _ c _ )  @xmath107 and ( _ d _ )  @xmath108 .",
    "the messenger scale has been fixed at our canonical choice @xmath63  tev .",
    "we see that the photonic branching fraction dominates for the entire range of @xmath1 even though @xmath73 is as heavy as @xmath109  gev for @xmath110  tev .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that @xmath111 .",
    "since the zino component of @xmath112 is suppressed relative to the photino component by @xmath113 , we expect that @xmath114 is suppressed by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "the remaining suppression comes from the strong @xmath115 suppression of these decays .",
    "the decay rate to @xmath116 is negligible because the higgsino component of @xmath18 is tiny .",
    "the decay length @xmath117 of the neutralino is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 for ( _ a _ )  @xmath63  tev with @xmath118 , ( _ b _ )  @xmath119  tev with @xmath118 , ( _ c _ )  @xmath63  tev with @xmath120 and ( _ d _ )  @xmath119  tev with @xmath120 .",
    "the curves are for three different values of @xmath121 and 4 , ( from bottom to top ) . in this plot , we have fixed @xmath64 .",
    "we expect our results are insensitive to this choice as long as @xmath122 .",
    "we see that for our canonical choice @xmath63  tev , the decay length varies from a fraction of a millimeter to a few centimeters .",
    "thus the neutralinos will decay inside the detector and the displaced vertices from which a high energy photon shower emerges could provide additional confirmation of this scenario .",
    "for the larger value of @xmath19 shown , the decay length could be as large as several meters if @xmath123 is small , so that the neutralino would decay outside the detector . in this case",
    ", the topological signatures would be similar to those in the minimal model : the vestiges of the gmlesb model would show up only via the sparticle mass patterns .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath19 could cause the @xmath18 to mainly decay outside the electromagnetic calorimeter , or within the muon chamber . whether these decays can be readily identified and/or the photon energy measured is an important experimental issue .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the sparticle mass scale provides a handle on @xmath1 , a measurement @xcite of the decay length of @xmath18 would directly yield information about the messenger scale , particularly if the composition of the @xmath18 could be determined from other experiments .",
    "the patterns of sparticle masses , and hence , the cross sections for various sparticle processes can be quite different from expectations in , for instance , the msugra framework . in order to compute these cross sections as well as to generate susy events at the tevatron within the gmlesb model framework , we have interfaced the output for the various weak scale parameters as obtained by rge , starting from the gmlesb boundary conditions with isajet @xcite .",
    "we begin by showing in fig .",
    "7 the cross sections for various susy processes as a function of @xmath1 for the same cases ( _ a_)-(_d _ ) shown in fig .  5 .",
    "again , we have fixed @xmath124  tev .",
    "we use the cteq2l structure functions @xcite for our computations .",
    "we show the cross sections for the dominant @xmath125 and @xmath126 processes separately , and group together the processes of slepton and sneutrino pair production in the figure .",
    "the curve labelled `` oth . ''",
    "refers to other chargino and neutralino processes while `` assoc . ''",
    "refers to the production of a gluino or squark in association with a chargino or a neutralino .",
    "we note the following .    * over the complete range of @xmath1 where the cross sections are potentially observable , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and slepton / sneutrino production processes dominate .",
    "the production of gluinos and squarks is always subdominant .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that gluinos and squarks are rather heavy even for the smallest allowed value of @xmath1 . *",
    "the strongly interacting sparticles get rapidly heavier as @xmath1 increases , so that their cross sections drop off faster for a fixed collider energy . for the same reason",
    ", the production cross section for electroweak sparticles falls off the slowest , with the associated production cross sections in between . *",
    "the cross section for the production of `` other '' charginos and neutralinos is significant for smaller values of @xmath1 shown , particularly if @xmath127 .",
    "presumably , this is because @xmath38 is not overwhelmingly large and gaugino - higgsino mixing tends to reduce the sparticle masses .      for each set ( @xmath1 , @xmath69 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 ) , of input gmlesb parameters , our rge program yields a set of weak scale susy parameters .",
    "we use these as an input to isajet to generate susy events at the tevatron .",
    "thus , for any set of gmlesb parameters isajet generates all @xmath128 susy processes ( those mediated by @xmath129-channel higgs production must be run separately ) with appropriate cross sections , and decays all sparticles as in the minimal susy model .",
    "the decay @xmath27 with a branching fraction of 100% ( this is an excellent approximation as can be seen from fig",
    ".  5 ) is added to the isajet decay table .",
    "gravitino decays of sparticles other than @xmath18 are ignored @xcite .    to model the experimental conditions at the tevatron , we use the toy calorimeter simulation package isaplt .",
    "we simulate calorimetry covering @xmath130 with a cell size given by @xmath131 , and take the hadronic ( electromagnetic ) calorimeter resolution to be @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "jets are defined as hadronic clusters with @xmath134  gev within a cone of @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "muons and electrons with @xmath137  gev and @xmath138 are considered to be isolated if the visible hadronic @xmath139 within a cone of @xmath140 about the lepton direction is smaller than 5  gev .",
    "we identify photons within @xmath141 if @xmath142  gev , and consider them to be isolated if the additional @xmath139 within a cone of @xmath140 about the photon is less than 4  gev .",
    "moreover , we assume that a photon within the acceptance is detected with an efficency of 80% ( 100% ) if its energy is smaller ( greater ) than 25  gev . in our analysis",
    ", we neglect multiple scattering effects as well as any detector - dependent effects such as lepton , photon or jet misidentification .",
    "finally , in our simulation , we have not incorporated the finite decay length of the @xmath18 but assumed that the @xmath18 decays at the production vertex .",
    "this will introduce some small error in the direction of the photons from the decays @xmath102 for our choice of @xmath63 tev .",
    "although the displacement of the @xmath18 decay vertices should be properly included in a complete simulation , we see from fig .",
    "6 that over most of the parameter range for which we have performed our simulation , the decay length is a fraction of a centimetre so that the results we show below should not be qualitatively altered .",
    "we classify gmlesb signals at the tevatron primarily by the number of isolated photons , and then further separate them by their lepton content .",
    "we also distinguish events which do or do not contain jets .",
    "in addition to a global cut @xmath143  gev , we require that every event must satisfy at least one of the following lepton , photon or jet requirements which are motivated by the need for a trigger :    * 1@xmath144 with @xmath145  gev , or @xmath146 with @xmath147  gev ; * two isolated photons ; * two jets with @xmath148  gev and @xmath149  gev .    the results of our calculations of the cross sections for various event topologies after imposing the cuts and",

    "the solid lines show the cross section for events with jets , while the dotted lines show the cross sections for `` clean '' events free of jet activity . we have performed event simulations for values of @xmath1 between 40 - 140  tev in steps of 20  tev and denoted the cross sections @xmath32-lepton events by the symbol @xmath32 in the figures .",
    "the following remarks about fig .  8-fig",
    ".  11 are worth noting :    1 .",
    "for all the four combinations of @xmath69 and @xmath17 shown in these figures , we see that cross sections for events with jets dominate the cross sections for clean events .",
    "this is because over most of the parameter space , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the dominant sparticle production mechanisms , and at least @xmath151 typically has a large branching fraction for hadronic decays . for the smaller values of @xmath1 shown in the figure",
    ", @xmath152 is the only two body decay channel that is kinematically allowed , so that the leptonic decays of @xmath153 dominate .",
    "as @xmath1 becomes larger , the decays @xmath154 and @xmath155 become accessible and dominate the decay to right - handed sleptons , so that @xmath153 then mainly decays via its hadronic mode .",
    "this also accounts for why the dotted lines in fig .",
    "11 exhibit a steeper fall - off than their solid counterparts .",
    "most of the dilepton plus multijet events contain opposite sign dileptons in this case because contributions to the signal from @xmath156 and @xmath157 production are subdominant ( see fig .",
    "7 ) since gluinos and squarks tend to be heavy .",
    "we see that for the jetty event sample , the cross section for @xmath158 events is larger by a factor 1.5 - 4 than the cross sections in the 0 or 2 photon event samples .",
    "this is , of course , sensitive to our assumptions about the @xmath150 acceptance ( @xmath141 ) and detection efficiency and could be different for run ii of the tevatron .",
    "4 .   for the case of the clean events shown in the figures , we see that cross sections where both photons are observed tend to be larger than those where the photons escape detection .",
    "this is presumably because it is easier for the photons to satisfy the isolation requirements than in the case of jetty events .",
    "a comparison of the four figures shows that the various cross sections vary rather weakly with @xmath69 but show slightly more sensitivity to @xmath17 ( when @xmath69 is not large ) .",
    "we have not made an attempt to compute sm backgrounds to the susy event sample from the gmlesb model .",
    "background levels for the zero photon sample in case ( _ a _ ) shown in these figures have been previously estimated@xcite , although not with precisely the same cuts .",
    "we surmise that the presence of additional isolated photons , and possibly , also the presence of up to two significantly displaced vertices ( without charged tracks emerging from them ) would reduce the _ physics _",
    "backgrounds to negligible levels . of course",
    ", a careful computation that includes the effects of the non - zero decay length of the nlsp should ultimately be carried out to ensure there are no unforeseen surprises .",
    "assuming that the signal is indeed rate - limited , we estimate the susy reach of the tevatron for an integrated luminosity of ( _ i _ )  100  @xmath159 , corresponding to the size of the run i data sample per experiment , ( _ ii _ )  2  @xmath160 , the integrated luminosity expected to be accumulated after about two years of main injector operation at design luminosity , and finally , ( _ iii _ )  25  @xmath160 , the integrated luminosity that might optimistically be accumulated at the proposed tev33 upgrade @xcite of the tevatron . for our estimate of the run",
    "i and run ii reach , we take the 5 signal event level as our criterion for observability in any one channel , while for tev33 , we take the observability level to be 10 events , and show the corresponding cross sections by the horizontal dashed lines in the figure .",
    "we see that when the data from run i is analysed , the cdf and d0 experiments will be probing @xmath1 values of 50 - 60  tev . with the main injector , experiments at the tevatron should be able to explore up to @xmath161  tev .",
    "if tev33 is able to accumulate a data sample of 25  @xmath160 , then the reach should extend out to about 135  tev .",
    "for comparison with earlier studies of the tevatron reach , these reach numbers correspond to @xmath79 values of @xmath162 and 1100  gev .",
    "in contrast to the msugra case @xcite , we find here that the reach via the clean channels is smaller than via jetty channels .",
    "it should , of course , be remembered that we are not directly probing such massive gluinos at the tevatron , but obtaining the signal via the chargino and neutralino channels .",
    "also , we remind the reader that our estimate of the reach may be somewhat optimistic since we have assumed that backgrounds are completely negligible : there could be important detector - dependent backgrounds that may not be ignorable .",
    "on the other hand , the reach could be even larger than our estimate if we sum up the expected signal in the many different channels .    before closing this discussion , we remark upon the various attempts in the literature @xcite to account for the @xmath163 event by the cdf collaboration@xcite within the gmlesb framework .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "11 that while it is indeed possible to have a cross section of about 10  @xmath164 for clean dilepton plus two photon events ( corresponding to @xmath165  event in the run i data ) , _ this event should have been accompanied by at least an order of magnitude ( and possibly , as many as fifty ) times as many events in other channels .",
    "_ for this reason , we feel that this interpretation of the cdf event is unlikely at least within this minimal framework .",
    "we should mention , however , that it is possible to reduce the ratio of slepton to electroweak gaugino masses by increasing the number of @xmath166 fields in the messenger sector .",
    "this can not be larger than four if gauge couplings are to remain perturbative up to the gut scale , but it is possible to arrange for @xmath167 and @xmath168 to be the only two body decays of the charginos and neutralinos if @xmath1 is not large . in this case , the hadronic signals from @xmath151 and @xmath153 production would be greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to simulate such a scenario to see whether it is possible for the dominant signal to be in the @xmath169 channel .",
    "but we stress that it is necessary to check all other signals that are likely to be present before attributing the cdf event to sparticle production within the gmlesb picture .",
    "during the last year or two , we have witnessed the emergence of a phenomenologically viable alternative to the minimal sugra model for analyses of supersymmetry .",
    "this new scenario is similar to sugra in that susy is dynamically broken in a hidden sector of the theory which does not couple to the known particles and their super - partners via sm gauge interactions .",
    "effects of susy breaking are communicated to the known particles via sm gauge interactions with a messenger sector which also couples to the hidden sector .",
    "the difference is that while gravity plays the role of the messenger within the sugra framework , new sets of messenger fields are invoked in these novel scenarios .",
    "thus , while the messenger scale is necessarily @xmath170 for sugra models , this scale may be as small as a few hundred tev within the novel gmlesb scenario .    from a phenomenological point of view , the sugra and gmlesb scenarios differ in two crucial respects .",
    "first , the boundary conditions for the rge that determines the weak scale parameters of the theory are different : in the msugra case , we have universal parameters at a scale @xmath171 , while in the gmlesb case , sparticle masses , which are radiatively generated at the messenger scale are proportional to the sm gauge couplings squared . as a result , sparticles with the same gauge quantum numbers have the same masses ( unless they have large yukawa type interactions ) so that flavour changing neutral currents are automatically suppressed .",
    "second , unlike the msugra framework where the lightest neutralino is the lsp and the gravitino decouples from particle physics , the gravitino is superlight within the gmlesb scenario and @xmath18 decays into a gravitino and a photon ( or , possibly also a higgs or @xmath172 boson ) . for sparticles in the mass range accessible at the tevatron ,",
    "only the photon decays of @xmath18 are significant , so that every susy event contains two isolated hard photons ( though these may not both be detected ) .    in section",
    "ii we have set up the parameter space for the simplest gmlesb scenario and examined the extent that this has directly been probed by experiments at high energy colliders or indirectly via the effects of virtual sparticles on the flavour changing decay @xmath100 .",
    "we have also shown that a measurement of the decay length of the @xmath18 yields information about the messenger scale .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to study the cross sections for various event topologies that should be accessible at the tevatron within the minimal gmlesb picture . towards this end",
    "we have interfaced the weak scale susy parameters obtained from these boundary conditions with isajet to obtain these cross sections .",
    "we believe that our calculations are the first semi - realistic simulations performed within this framework .",
    "our main results are exhibited in fig .",
    "8-fig .  11 for experimental conditions suitable at the tevatron .",
    "we see that , unlike in sugra where multijet plus @xmath173 events form the dominant event topology , multijet plus @xmath174 plus 1 photon events are the major component of the susy cross section .",
    "similar events with two isolated photons or zero photons , which have only a slightly smaller cross section , may also be present at observable levels even in the run i data sample ( and certainly at the main injector upgrade ) if any observation in the single photon channel is to be attributed to the minimal gmlesb realization of susy .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the relative sizes for the 0:1:2 @xmath150 cross sections are sensitive to our assumptions about the photon acceptance and detection efficiency .",
    "we also see that the cross section for clean multileptons plus photon event topologies is below our level of detectability during the current run : a handful of such events may , however , be present in the cdf and d0 run  i data samples if @xmath1 is not too large . at the main injector , up to several tens of clean @xmath175 and @xmath150 plus multiple lepton events may be present .",
    "while the reach extends out to about @xmath176  tev for run  i experiments , the main injector ( tev33 ) should be able to probe up to @xmath177  tev ( 135  tev ) , which corresponds to @xmath178  gev ( 1  tev ) !",
    "how stable are our conclusions to model variations ?",
    "we note that there is a small region of parameter space ( the cross - hatched region in fig .",
    "2 ) where @xmath87 is the nlsp . for parameters in this region",
    ", all susy events will contain at least 2 - 4 @xmath91 leptons but no photons in the final state .",
    "we note that the phenomenology may be sensitive to assumptions about the messenger sector .",
    "for instance , if instead of assuming that it contains a single vector multiplet of @xmath41 , if instead we assume it contains four such multiplets ( coupling roughly the same way ) , then slepton and squark masses reduce by about half relative to the electroweak gaugino and gluino masses .",
    "this could have a significant impact on sparticle decay patterns and the resulting phenomenology .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the implications for experiments at the tevatron in a new class of models where susy is broken at relatively low energy , and the effects of susy breaking communicated by gauge interactions .",
    "the production of sparticles at the tevatron would then result in a variety of events with @xmath32-jets + @xmath179-leptons + @xmath180-photons + @xmath173 .",
    "we have computed the cross sections for these event topologies under experimental conditions appropriate to the tevatron , and mapped out its reach within the parameter space of the model for both the current run as well as the main injector ( and tev33 ) upgrades .",
    "observation of these events would not only be spectacular in that it would signal the discovery of a fundamental new symmetry of nature , but also in that it would imply the existence of a whole new family of particles not very far beyond the multi - tev scale .",
    "in contrast to the case of the desert hypothesis , we would have a hope of directly probing this sector in the foreseeable future .",
    "in the mean time , we might be able to obtain @xcite indirect information about the physics of this sector via the experimental determination of masses and other properties of sparticles .",
    "we are grateful to our colleagues in the theory subgroup of the supersymmetry working group at snowmass96 , especially scott thomas and j. lykken for valuable discussions and sharing their insights .",
    "we also thank t. ter veldhuis for discussions and comments .",

    "note added : while this paper was in preparation , we received two papers @xcite where the spectroscopy and the phenomenology of the minimal gmlesb model as well as of models with extended messenger sectors is considered . while parts of these papers overlap with the present work , neither of these papers performed explicit event generation for the gmlesb model for the tevatron collider .",
