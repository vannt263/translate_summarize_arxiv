    "the symmetry energy is a measure of the energy involved in converting the excess neutrons to protons in asymmetric nuclear matter . a kinetic contribution to it comes from the associated shift of the neutron ( n ) and proton ( p ) fermi energies ,",

    "the methodology employed to calculate the symmetry energy and symmetry free energy coefficients as a function of excitation energy or density is outlined in the following .",
    "when two nuclei collide at intermediate energy a hot nuclear system of neutrons and protons is formed , which is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium and can be described by a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the density profile of this hot system is generated in the finite temperature thomas - fermi ( fttf ) approximation with a chosen two - body effective interaction .",
    "the details of the employed fttf procedure are already documented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we do not present them here .    for an expanding system pursuing the equilibrium configuration ( as described later ) ,",
    "the surface diffuseness is likely to play an important role @xcite ; thus , a zero - range force like the skyrme interaction widely used to explore nuclear ground - state properties may not be very suitable for generating such a density profile .",
    "it is further noted that a constrained expanded system in the fttf approach may lead to numerical instabilities @xcite and the gradient ( surface ) terms in the energy density functional were replaced with a suitable yukawa interaction .",
    "we have therefore chosen a modified seyler - blanchard ( sbm ) effective interaction for the fttf calculations .",
    "this interaction is of finite range with momentum and density dependence and is given by @xcite @xmath5 \\frac{\\exp(-r / a)}{(r / a)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an effective isospin dependence in the interaction is brought through the different strength parameters @xmath6 for like - pair ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 for unlike pair ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the relative separations of the nucleons in configuration and momentum space are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the densities at the sites of the two interacting nucleons are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 corresponds to the range of the interaction , @xmath15 and @xmath16 determine its momentum and density dependence ; the density exponent @xmath17 controls the stiffness of the nuclear eos .",
    "this interaction reproduces quite well the ground - state binding energies , root - mean square charge radii and isoscalar giant monopole resonance energies for a host of even - even nuclei . with a density exponent @xmath18 ,",
    "the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath19 is 238 mev",
    ". a stiff eos with @xmath20 mev can be simulated with @xmath21 .    in the fttf approach ,",
    "the nucleon density profile at temperature @xmath4 has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23^{3/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 is the fermi integral @xmath25 with the fugacity @xmath26 given as @xmath27/t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eqs .",

    "the particle density therefore does not vanish .",
    "the pressure at the surface is then nonzero making the system thermodynamically unstable ; the density then depends on the size of the box in which the fttf calculations are performed .",
    "this problem is overcome in the subtraction procedure @xcite , where the hot nucleus , assumed to be a thermalized system in equilibrium with a surrounding gas representing evaporated nucleons , is separated from the embedding environment .",
    "the method is based on the existence of two solutions to the fttf equations , one corresponding to the liquid phase with the surrounding gas ( @xmath36 ) and other corresponding to the gas ( @xmath37 ) phase .",
    "the density profile of the hot nucleus in thermodynamic equilibrium is given by @xmath38 .",
    "it is independent of the box size in which calculations are done .",
    "it also goes to zero at large distances , implying a vanishing surface pressure .",
    "we call this the base density ( it is also sometimes called the liquid profile )",

    "once the energy and entropy are known , the free energy is calculated from @xmath49 .    in the above ,",
    "the description of the hot nucleus is grand canonical obtained from the minimization of the grand potential ( the temperature is a constant ) . in experimental conditions , however , when two nuclei collide , the hot system is formed in isolation , its total excitation energy remains a constant .",
    "the system might be compressed initially , resulting in a collective flow in the decompression stage but we ignore it in the present work .",
    "the system is microcanonical ; to attain equilibrium , it expands in quest of maximum entropy .",
    "it is , however , still possible to describe the system statistically by an effective temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it has the operational advantage that it helps in defining an occupation function that can be employed in evaluating various observables like energy , entropy , etc .",
    "the expansion of the hot nucleus is simulated through a self - similar scaling approximation for the density , @xmath50 where the scaling parameter @xmath51 is unity for the unbloated nucleus and decreases with expansion , lying in the range @xmath52 ; @xmath53 is the scaled density and @xmath54 is the base density profile generated in the subtracted fttf framework . besides its simplicity , there is no _ a priori _ justification for this choice , however , it has been shown that with a harmonic oscillator potential , at relatively small temperatures , the scaled density profiles and those generated self - consistently in a constrained thomas - fermi @xcite procedure are equivalent @xcite .",
    "one further needs to account properly for the effect of collectivity , as the coupling of the single - particle motion with the collective degrees of freedom @xcite is not included in the fttf procedure .",
    "this coupling introduces an extra energy dependence in the nucleon effective mass ( @xmath55 , the @xmath56mass ) in addition to the @xmath30mass .",
    "the total effective mass @xmath57 can then be written as @xmath58 the @xmath59mass is surface - peaked and has values generally larger @xcite than the nucleon mass @xmath60 .",
    "this increase brings down the excited states from higher energy to lower energy near the fermi surface , thus increasing the many - body density of states at low excitations .",
    "the system can then accommodate comparatively more entropy at a given excitation energy .",
    "the coupling of collectivity with the nucleonic single - particle motion may thus have a significant role in getting the equilibrium maximal entropy configuration .",
    "a self - consistent evaluation of @xmath55 is very involved ; for simplicity , we take the same phenomenological form of refs .",
    "@xcite for it .",
    "an in - depth presentation of our computational method of the expanded hot nucleus with inclusion of collectivity can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus we do not dwell further on it here .",

    "to compute the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 in finite nuclei we adopt the following prescription .",
    "once the neutron and proton equilibrium density profiles of a nucleus with @xmath78 neutrons and @xmath79 protons ( @xmath80 ) at an excitation energy @xmath81 and temperature @xmath4 are known , the symmetry energy coefficient can be calculated in the local density approximation ( lda ) as  @xcite @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the symmetry energy coefficient at temperature @xmath4 of infinite nuclear matter at a density equal to the local density @xmath54 of the nucleus and @xmath84 is the local isospin asymmetry .",
