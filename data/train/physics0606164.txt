    ", we assume that there is no extremely large tick return dominating the aggregate return , so that we focus on the average size @xmath16 of the non - zero tick returns , which is defined by @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the number of @xmath19 in the interval @xmath6 . neglecting assymetries in the @xmath11",
    ", we can replace all @xmath20 by @xmath21 and approximate the aggregate return by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is called number difference .",
    "similarly , @xmath10 can be described as a diffusion process with @xmath24 where the diffusion constant @xmath25 varies due to the varying step width @xmath16 and the number @xmath18 of non - zero tick returns .    in the approximation given by eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] , we can study the influence of the mean size of the tick returns as well as asymmetries in their direction . a large aggregate return can occur if the price moves more often in one direction than in the other .",
    "thus , with large temporary correlations between the signs , even small tick returns could compose a large @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath16 is larger , even a small asymmetry in the signs can lead to a large return .",
    "the two approximations given in eq .",
    "[ g_i_max.eq ] and eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] are analyzed in sections iii and iv of this paper , but in section vi we also consider the error term neglected in eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] .",
    "an exact formulation writes @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the average tick returns in positive and negative direction while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the numbers of non - negative tick returns in positive and negative direction .",
    "we analyzed order book data of the year 2002 from island ecn for the ten most frequently traded stocks  @xcite . since the island ecn is a secondary market where only part of the whole stock volume is traded",
    ", we also studied the index fund qqq which was mainly traded via island until september 2002 .",
    "since our results for the ten stocks and qqq are similar , we find no evidence that secondary market characteristics of island affect our analysis negatively .    in an electronic market place like island",
    ", people can place limit orders to buy or to sell at a given or better price ( limit price ) , which is specified in the order .",
    "these orders are stored in the order book and they are only executed when the actual stock price reaches the limit price .",
    "a trade is initiated by a market order indicating that someone wants to buy or sell immediately at the best available price .",
    "such a market order executes the limit orders offering the best prices until the number of shares specified in the market order is traded .",
    "our dataset contains information about every limit order so that we are able to reproduce the market situation at each instant of time .",
    "we combine those limit order executions with identical time stamps as they reflect the same market order .",
    "therefore , we can analyze the impact of each single market order on the price .",
    "in this analysis , the price is defined as the mid - quote price which is the mean of the best available buy ( bid ) and sell ( ask ) limit prices ( quotes ) .",
    "we study intervals with a fixed number of @xmath2 market orders and have approximately 100,000 intervals in our dataset for ten stocks .",
    "thus , on average a 100 trade interval corresponds to about 10 minutes , but the trading frequency fluctuates strongly so that 100 trades can correspond to time intervals with very different lengths .",
    "we determine the mid - quote price @xmath4 just before the execution of the @xmath3-th market order .",
    "since most trades change the price just by the size of the gap between the best and the second best limit price @xcite , the tick return @xmath11 corresponds to the gap size .",
    "we note that the price can ( and often does ) change between two consecutive market orders due to placement or cancellation of limit orders so that @xmath11 does not provide a direct estimate of the gap size .",
    "we normalize the tick returns @xmath11 by the standard deviation of the aggregate return @xmath10 for each stock individually so that we can combine the results for different stocks .",
    "first , we investigate the question whether large tick returns caused by large gaps in the order book can be responsible for large aggregate returns . to this end , we start with the approximation shown in eq .  [ g_i_max.eq ]",
    "where a few extremely large tick returns ( corresponding to some very large gaps in the order book ) lead to a very large aggregate return @xmath10 . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we analyzed the five largest tick returns @xmath31 with the same sign as the aggregate return @xmath10 ( i.e. the five largest positive @xmath11 if @xmath32 and the five largest negative @xmath33 for @xmath34 ) in each time interval . to this end , we sort the intervals by @xmath35 and plot the @xmath31 against the rank of the interval according to its return @xmath35 .",
    "[ g_plus_max_12345_rank_other_avg.fig](a ) shows the values of these @xmath31 in intervals with small @xmath36 on the left while the values for large returns exceeding five standard deviations can be found on the right .",
    "since there are large fluctuations in the data , we smoothed the curves by averaging over 100 intervals .",
    "the @xmath31 grow by a factor of two between small and very large returns @xmath35 . when aggregated",
    ", these five largest @xmath31 can reach about three standard deviations , which is almost half of the largest aggregate returns .    in fig .",
    "[ g_plus_max_12345_rank_other_avg.fig](b ) , we plot the five largest tick returns @xmath37 with the opposite direction as the aggregate return against their rank .",
    "the @xmath37 behave similarly to the @xmath31 , though the increase for large aggregate returns is slightly weaker .",
    "however , even for the largest aggregate returns the difference between the @xmath38 and @xmath37 is rather small , so that there are also large tick returns reducing the aggregate return .",
    "our results suggest that large aggregate returns are not the result of single exceptionally large tick returns since very large tick returns occur in both directions and cancel each other out . in the following ,",
    "we want to focus not on the extreme tick returns , but on the influence of their mean value .",
    "more precisely , we analyze eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] and the mean tick return @xmath16 of all non - zero @xmath39 in the interval @xmath6 as defined in eq .",
    "[ delta_g.eq ] . a density plot of @xmath35 against @xmath16 is shown in fig .  [ regression_g_dg.fig ] .",
    "it seems that extremely large returns @xmath10 correspond to larger average tick returns @xmath16 , but the broad distribution suggests that the explanatory power of @xmath16 alone for the aggregate return @xmath10 is small , which is confirmed by the low correlation coefficient @xmath40 of a linear regression .    in order to clarify the relation between the extreme values of @xmath35 and @xmath16",
    ", we sort the intervals by @xmath35 and plot @xmath41 against the rank of the interval according to its return @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ dg_rank.fig ] ( black curve ) , we see that large returns @xmath35 coincide with larger tick returns as @xmath16 changes by a factor of two from very low aggregate returns to large returns of several standard deviations . in comparison with",
    "the largest tick returns @xmath31 shown in fig .",
    "[ g_plus_max_12345_rank_other_avg.fig ] , the change of a factor of two is similar , but the mean @xmath16 is two to four times smaller than the largest tick returns .",
    "this finding can be explained by the presence of autocorrelations in the time series of @xmath11 , which can be illustrated when we shuffle the data for each stock by exchanging each tick return with another randomly chosen tick return .",
    "the light grey curve in fig .  [ dg_rank.fig ] shows that for shuffled data @xmath16 increases only marginally for large aggregate returns , suggesting that autocorrelations of the tick returns have a strong influence on the mean tick return size @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , we find that the absolute values @xmath39 of the tick return are long - range correlated in tick time with a correlation function decaying like @xmath42 for large time lags @xmath43 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ autocorr.fig ] .",
    "if these correlations are destroyed by shuffling , in each interval of 100 trades only a few large tick returns remain so that the average over these 100 tick returns approximates the global mean of all tick returns in the data set .",
    "in contrast , in the empirical unshuffled data correlations lead to intervals where many tick returns are large , so that the average tick return size is also large .",
    "the average tick return size @xmath16 can well characterize the interval only because these autocorrelations exist .",
    "it turns out that the increase of @xmath16 by a factor of two is the main effect where the original empirical data deviates significantly from shuffled data .",
    "hence , we suggest that fluctuations of the tick return size are responsible for the non - gaussian fluctuations of the aggregate return .    using eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] , we can estimate whether the change by a factor of two of the average tick return alone is enough to explain large aggregate returns @xmath10 of more than five standard deviations . to this end",
    ", we focus on the intervals with the 50 largest aggregate returns ranging from approximately 4 to almost 8 standard deviations . here , we find that @xmath16 fluctuates between 0.14 and 0.35 . assuming uncorrelated returns , @xmath44 should be of the order @xmath45 if each trade would lead to a price change , but normal fluctuations could well lead to @xmath44 twice as large as @xmath46 , so that large tick returns together with fluctuations in the number difference could explain the large aggregate returns we find in our data set .",
    "thus , we find that in intervals with 100 trades large @xmath35 do not mainly depend on single extremely large tick returns .",
    "it rather turns out that correlations between the tick returns lead to large average tick returns @xmath16 in an interval , and the fluctuations of @xmath16 can account for the non - gaussian distribution of the aggregate returns .",
    "the diffusion process of aggregate returns is not only influenced by the step width ( i.e.  the tick return size ) , but also by the direction of the steps . therefore , we now analyze the influence of the number difference @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] . in order to treat positive and negative aggregate returns in the same analysis ,",
    "it is useful to replace @xmath44 by the sign - adapted number difference @xmath47 a positive value of @xmath48 indicates that the price tends to move in one specific direction leading to an aggregate return with the same sign .",
    "@xmath48 can be negative if there are a few large tick returns determining the direction of the aggregate return , but also many small tick returns with the opposite direction which do not affect the aggregate return very much .",
    "[ regression_g_dn.fig ] shows a density plot of the aggregate return @xmath35 against the sign - adapted number difference @xmath48 .",
    "a linear regression yields an @xmath49 of @xmath50 , a large correlation coefficient confirming the visual impression that @xmath48 and @xmath35 are strongly connected .",
    "we can also see that @xmath48 is mostly positive for large returns @xmath10 , so that each large price change is accompanied by a certain sign - adapted number difference @xmath48 .",
    "we now plot in fig .",
    "[ dn_rank.fig ] @xmath48 against the rank according to @xmath35 .",
    "we find that except for the largest ( approximately 15% ) of the aggregate returns , @xmath48 grows linearly with the rank while in fig .",
    "[ dg_rank.fig ] @xmath16 remained almost constant in that region .",
    "for the largest ranks , @xmath51 increases more rapidly , so that all in all the smoothed curve ( averaged over 100 intervals ) grows from 0 to 18 between very small and extremely large aggregate returns .",
    "thus , in intervals with very large returns there are approximately 18 trades pushing the price in one direction ( assuming that all other trades cancel each other out ) , so that even with rather small tick returns this can lead to large returns in aggregation",
    ". focusing on the 50 largest @xmath10 , we find that @xmath48 ranges from 4 to 41 , clearly above the expected standard deviation of 10 when assuming uncorrelated returns and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the fluctuations of @xmath48 around the mean value are crucial for getting large aggregate returns",
    ". the number difference seems to be the main mechanism affecting the aggregate return since it changes much more drastically than the tick return size when the aggregate return increases . on the other hand , when we compare the results to the analysis with shuffled data ( light grey curve in fig .",
    "[ dn_rank.fig ] ) , it turns out that this effect is very similar to what happens with random price changes .",
    "hence , the basic movement of the aggregate return seems to depend mostly on the number difference , but the non - gaussian large aggregate price changes only occur if the tick returns are large .",
    "it is known that the signs of market orders are strongly correlated @xcite which means that there is a large probability that a buy market order will be followed by another buy market order .",
    "thus , it is probable that large number differences in the direction of tick returns are caused by large numbers of equally signed market orders . in order to analyze the relation between the number difference and the market order flow , we define the difference @xmath53 between the number @xmath54 of market orders with the same direction as @xmath10 and the market orders with opposite direction @xmath55 :    @xmath56    in fig .  [ scatter_dn_dnm.fig ] we plot the sign - adapted number difference @xmath48 against the market order difference @xmath57 .",
    "we find a strong correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath53 , a linear regression yields a correlation coefficient @xmath49 of 0.29 . however , there are also large fluctuations suggesting that the number difference is also due to order book dynamics , namely limit order placement and cancellation as well as asymmetries in the order book . a model for price formation due to these quantities",
    "was recently proposed by mike and farmer @xcite .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we analyzed the mechanism leading to large aggregate returns and showed that the varying step width @xmath41 accounts for the non - gaussian behavior of the diffusion process of price movements .",
    "now we want to use our results in a statistical model and reproduce the cumulative distribution function of the absolute value of the aggregate return @xmath35 .    the model given by eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] belongs to the well - known class of stochastic volatility models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) consisting of a noise term multiplied by a time - dependent volatility giving the magnitude of the fluctuations . in the present paper ,",
    "the model is based on a microscopic description of the price process , so that we can fit the microscopic quantities determining the aggregate return in order to estimate the parameters of the model . in this approach",
    "the model is parameter - free in the sense that there are no parameters fitting the aggregate returns directly , though we fit the distributions of its determinants like the step width @xmath16 and the number difference @xmath44 .",
    "we also discuss corrections to the model by including the tick return asymmetries according to eq .",
    "[ g_j_exact.eq ] .",
    "we first analyze the distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath58 .",
    "[ distribution_dg_dn_dgpm.fig](a ) shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath16 in a log - linear plot .",
    "the approximately straight line suggests that the tail follows an exponential distribution which can be well fitted with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the average of all @xmath16 and the parameters are @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the region of the smallest values of @xmath63",
    "the limited tick sizes of the different stocks lead to a plateau . in section",
    "iv we already found evidence that @xmath44 behaves similarly to uncorrelated data since in fig .",

    "[ g_i.eq ] , we simulate two independent time series according to the fitted functions for @xmath16 and @xmath44 and build the aggregate return @xmath10 as the product of @xmath16 and @xmath58 . in figure [ distribution_g.fig ]",
    "we can compare the empirically found cumulative distribution of aggregate returns @xmath35 ( circles ) to the results of this simulation ( triangles ) . the simulation of eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] leads to a reasonable agreement with the actual aggregate return , but it overestimates the probability of large aggregate returns .",
    "we note that the parameters of the simulation are completely determined by the empirically found distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath44 , so that in this sense the simulation of @xmath35 has no free parameters .    in the following ,",
    "we want to address the remaining deviations of the simulation from the empirical data .",
    "[ g_j_exact.eq ] gives an exact formula for @xmath10 and provides a good parameterization for the error term which reads @xmath64 we find that the term @xmath65 has no systematic influence on the aggregate return since it shows almost no dependence on the rank according to the aggregate return . in the following ,",
    "we thus approximate it by its average value @xmath66 , so that the error term is determined by the asymmetries @xmath67 in the mean tick return size .    the cumulative distribution of @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "[ distribution_dg_dn_dgpm.fig](c ) .",
    "the main part of the distribution could be well fitted by an exponential function , but in the tail the distribution becomes broader .",
    "thus , we add the term with @xmath67 to our simulation by creating a third independent time series according to the empirical distribution of @xmath67 . fig .",
    "[ distribution_g.fig ] ( diamonds ) shows that this leads to an even broader distribution of the aggregate return . since the difference to the distribution according to eq .",
    "[ g_i.eq ] is small , the tick return asymmetry seems to have only a small influence on the aggregate return .",
    "a more accurate agreement with the empirical data can be obtained by taking into account correlations between the quantities involved in the process .",
    "the correlation coefficients between them are shown in the following table where the correlations between the absolute values are shown in brackets :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ size.tab ]    @xmath16 and @xmath68 show slightly negative correlations which might suggest that people act more cautiously when large tick returns indicate a low liquidity . in these times , traders try not to place too many consecutive orders with the same sign because they know that it could lead to a large price change and increased trading costs .",
    "furthermore , the strong anti - correlations between @xmath44 and @xmath67 also indicate cautious traders : if there are large asymmetries , so that e.g.  the positive tick returns are much larger than the negative ones , people tend to use the higher liquidity in negative direction so that in these times they sell more often than they buy . for an analysis of the relation between liquidity imbalance and market efficiency , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the large correlations between @xmath16 and @xmath69 show that we can expect large variations of the tick return in positive and negative direction when the tick return is in general large .",
    "we now want to incorporate correlations in our simulation .",
    "the strongest non - trivial correlations appear between @xmath70 and @xmath67 including also some of the correlations between @xmath67 and @xmath16 as well as @xmath44 .",
    "however , it turns out that the conditional expectation value @xmath71 is non - linear , as seen in fig .",
    "[ condexp_dgpm_dgdn.fig ] ( circles ) where it is plotted against @xmath72 .",
    "the function can be well fitted by @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( dashed line ) .    in order to incorporate this conditional expectation value into the simulation ,",
    "we first create three independent time series for @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath67 .",
    "then , for each @xmath76 we add the conditional expectation value @xmath77 to @xmath78 , according to the value of @xmath79 for that @xmath76 .",
    "this method leads to a different distribution for @xmath80 than the initial one , so that we can not anymore generate @xmath67 from the unconditional empirical distribution . as a rough approximation , we parameterize this distribution by two exponential functions @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "then , we adapt the factors in the exponent in such a way that the resulting unconditional distribution fits the empirical one ( a fit to the empirical distribution yields @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for the simulation we use the adapted @xmath85 and @xmath86 , compare fig .",
    "[ distribution_dg_dn_dgpm.fig](c ) ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath10 does not depend very much on the exact values of @xmath87 .",
    "the effect of the correlations represented by the conditional expectation value @xmath71 is very large and leads to a cumulative distribution of @xmath35 ( squares in fig .",
    "[ distribution_g.fig ] ) very similar to the empirical one ( circles ) .",
    "it is worth noting that now the largest events are not anymore necessarily the ones with the largest values of @xmath79 . due to the anti - correlations expressed in @xmath88 , very large values of @xmath79",
    "can lead to relatively large values of @xmath67 of the opposite sign reducing the aggregate return .",
    "in addition to the distribution of the aggregate return , the simulation does also agree with other properties of the empirical data we found earlier in this paper . in fig .",
    "[ dg_rank.fig ] and [ dn_rank.fig ] we also plotted the data from the simulation against the rank according to the aggregate return @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath44 the simulation matches the empirical data very well , while in figure [ dg_rank.fig ] we see that the simulated @xmath16 shows the same dependence on the rank as the empirical data , but it is generally a little larger than the real one except for the largest aggregate returns , which might be due to the cutoff around 0.094 we used in the simulation of the distribution of @xmath16 .",
    "we also find that the role of @xmath67 in determining large aggregate returns is a little overestimated by our simulation , but the simulation covers the main features of the empirical data although we neglected many of the subtle relations between the different quantities .",
    "our results can be divided into two parts : first , we showed that the movement of stock prices in intervals with a constant number of trades can be understood as a diffusion process with a varying step width . here , gaussian fluctuations of the number difference determine the basic price movement , but the non - gaussian large price changes are due to changes in the tick return size coinciding with large number differences at the same time .",
    "the large influence of the tick return size is caused by its autocorrelations assuring that in a 100 tick interval one can find many large tick returns so that the mean value of the tick return can be large .",
    "in such intervals , the price change in response to a trade is large , which is referred to as a period of low liquidity .",
    "thus , the diffusion process of stock returns depends largely on fluctuations in the liquidity , in agreement with the findings of previous works @xcite .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we found that the distribution of aggregate returns can be reasonably approximated by simulating the microscopic quantities mean tick return size and number difference according to their empirically found distributions .",
    "a more accurate agreement can be obtained by taking into account asymmetries in the tick return size in positive and negative direction as well as correlations between the different quantities .    to conclude , we found evidence that price fluctuations in intervals with a constant number of trades can be described by a diffusion process with a varying step width .",
    "the long - term autocorrelations in the tick return size make sure that periods of low liquidity , where the price change due to a trade is large , last long enough to cause large aggregate returns in intervals with many trades .",
    "our results suggests that the power law distribution of aggregate returns might not be universal but rather depends on a more complicated mechanism which is a combination of the dynamics of the trading frequency , the dynamics of the step width and the gaussian process of the step direction .",

    "<S> , large aggregate returns do not occur because of a few very large tick returns , but rather when the average tick return is large , so that even gaussian fluctuations in the direction of the trades can lead to aggregate return larger than in a gaussian distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section i shows our model for the price diffusion process , in section ii we describe the data set used for this study , section iii shows the influence of the tick return size on the aggregate return while section iv focusses on the influence of differences in the direction of tick returns ( number difference ) . </S>",
    "<S> section v compares the number difference and the flow of market orders and in section vi we present a statistical model which approximates the distribution of aggregate returns . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a discussion of our results in section vii . </S>"
