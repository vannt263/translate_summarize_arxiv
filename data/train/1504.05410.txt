    "the fascinating electronic transport properties of graphene have been the focus of intense experimental and theoretical investigation over the recent years.@xcite a particularly remarkable feature is the appearance of a finite minimum in the electrical conductivity as function of the doping level when the graphene sample is tuned close to the dirac point where electrons behave as ultra - relativistic particles.@xcite at the dirac point , the density of states and , hence , the charge - carrier concentration vanish in the absence of disorder . in that case , the minimum conductivity has been shown to originate from evanescent modes in the bulk and its value is found to be @xmath1.@xcite    disorder that is smooth on the scale of the lattice constant , a condition that is approximately met if the disorder originates from charged impurities at a finite distance from the graphene sheet , increases the value of such minimal conductivity .",
    "this at first sight counterintuitive phenomenon can be understood from the observation that a smooth disorder potential always creates a finite carrier concentration , independent of its sign .",
    "therefore , disorder turns a uniform graphene sheet with zero carrier density into a landscape of regions ( `` puddles '' ) that are electron or hole doped , separated by a network of carrier - free junctions.@xcite the effect on the conductivity results from a competition between this increase of carrier density and a simultaneous increase of scattering events among the charged particles .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations have shown that increasing disorder indeed leads to an increase of the conductivity.@xcite    the existing fully quantum coherent theories of transport near the dirac point use simplified models for the disorder potential , in which the potential fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "such gaussian disorder models are necessarily statistically particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to investigate the effect of an inherent statistical asymmetry between electron and hole - like puddles .",
    "we note that such asymmetry is relevant for experiments where , _",
    "e.g. _ , the charged impurities in the substrate may have a preferred charge .",
    "besides the experimental relevance , the investigation of the influence of particle - hole - asymmetric disorder on the conductivity of graphene furthermore reveals information about the nature of charge transport in graphene which can not be inferred from studies with particle - hole - symmetric ( gaussian ) disorder .",
    "finally , it has been realized recently , that disorder that does not break certain symmetries on the average may lead to so - called `` statistical topological insulator '' phases , which differ qualitatively from phases in which symmetries are not preserved in a statistical sense.@xcite    with particle - hole - asymmetric disorder , it becomes interesting to not only look at the _ magnitude _ of the minimal conductivity but also at its _ position _ as a function of the ( fermi ) energy .",
    "different models used to qualitatively describe electric transport in graphene predict different values for the doping level at which the minimal conductivity occurs . for example , if electronic transport is determined by percolation physics,@xcite one expects the conductance minimum to appear at a value of the energy @xmath2 for which the total sizes of particle- and hole - like puddles are roughly equal . on the other hand , in a mean - field boltzmann approach , in which the disorder is characterized by an effective carrier",
    "density,@xcite the conductivity minimum would be found at an energy @xmath3 where the mean carrier density is zero .",
    "finally , if the electrons are delocalized over distances that are much larger than the correlation length of the disorder , the charge carriers would feel only an effective potential averaged over a large area in space and the conductivity minimum would be expected at the energy @xmath4 for which charge carriers feel a potential landscape with zero mean .",
    "the same location of the conductivity minimum appears , if one requires that the absolute carrier density is a minimum . while all three values @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equal for particle - hole - symmetric potentials , they are in general different if the disorder potential lacks such symmetry .",

    "we extend an earlier study by schuessler , ostrovsky , gornyi , and mirlin,@xcite that addressed ballistic transport in graphene with gaussian disorder .",
    "although the perturbation theory is limited to finite system sizes only , we find a size - independent shift of the position conductivity minimum for weak particle - hole - asymmetric disorder . in the second part , we analyze disorder of arbitrary strength using a numerical method .",
    "our main result is that upon introducing particle - hole asymmetry the location of the conductivity minimum shifts in opposite directions for weak and strong disorder . for weak disorder ,",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the perturbative approach . for strong disorder",
