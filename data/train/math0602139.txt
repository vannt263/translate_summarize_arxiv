    "the flagellated bacteria ( e.g. _ escherichia coli _ , _ salmonella typhimurium _ , _ bacillus subtilis _ ) are single - celled organisms .",

    "the behaviour of a bacterium is primarily influenced by concentrations of various chemicals inside the cell .",

    ", the bacterial movement can be viewed as a biased random walk .",
    "bacterial motility is commonly provided by flagella , which are long , spiral - shaped protein rods that stick out from the surface of the cell salyers:2001:mdd .",
    "the example of flagellated bacterium is the enteric bacterium _",
    "e.coli _ which has 6 - 8 flagella .",
    "it has two modes of behaviour based on counterclockwise and clockwise flagellar rotation .",
    "when the flagella rotate counterclockwise ( ccw ) , they all point in one direction and consequently the cell moves forward in a straight run \" .",
    "the speed of running is @xmath171 clockwise ( cw ) rotation of the flagella causes the flagella to point in different directions , and the cell tumbles in place . tumbling reorients the cell , so that it can move in new direction when running starts again .    for _ e.coli_ ,",

    "the cell increases its time in running in a favourable direction ",
    "see figure [ figrw ] .",
    "= 4.5 in    as the mean time for tumbling is ten times smaller than the mean time of running , we can often neglect the time spent tumbling and we can model the movement of the bacterium as a velocity jump process othmer:1988:mdb , erban:2004:icb , erban:2004:sts as we already did in section [ secintro ] .",
    "it means that the bacterium runs in some direction and at random instants of time it changes its direction with mean turning rate @xmath173    since the bacteria move with more or less constant speed , the set @xmath37 of all available velocities might be considered equal to @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a unit sphere in @xmath176 and @xmath177 is the speed of the bacterium .",
    "let us note that set @xmath174 satisfies the general condition ( [ setvel ] ) ( the presented theory works for any set @xmath37 which satisfy ( [ setvel ] ) ) .",
    "the kernel @xmath31 gives the probability of a change in velocity from @xmath178 to @xmath179 , given that a reorientation occurs .",
    "the simples possibility is to assume that kernel is constant , i.e. @xmath180this formula satisfies the normalization condition ( [ normalcond ] ) .",
    "the underlying assumption behind ( [ romundistr1 ] ) is that ( during the tumble ) bacterium simply choose a new direction randomly which is relatively a good approximation for the bacterial chemotaxis , although there is also some bias in the direction of the preceding run @xcite .",
    "more realistically , one can assume that the turning kernel is a function of the angle between new and old velocity , i.e. @xmath181whatever the choice of @xmath31 is , we may assume that it is bounded from above by a constant , i.e. @xmath182where @xmath117 is independent of @xmath183 @xmath178 and @xmath5 .",
    "next , we have to specify the choice of ( [ rom14 ] ) and the properties of the turning frequency @xmath173    chemotaxis is the process by which a cell alters its movement in response to an extracellular chemical signal . from the microscopic ( cell )",
    "point of view , bacterial chemotaxis consists of several steps .",
    "first , the cell detects the signal using its receptors .",
    "then the signal information propagates through the signal transduction biochemical network described by ( [ rom14 ] ) .",
    "the output of this network is a phosphorylated form of the protein chey ( denoted chey - p ) which alters the motor behaviour of the flagellar motors and consequently , the movement of the cell .",
    "ccw is the default state in the absence of chey - p , which binds to motor proteins and increases cw rotation .",
    "attractant binding to a receptor reduces the phosphorylation rate of chey and thereby increases the time spent in running state which constitutes the fast response to a signal called _ excitation _ of signal transduction network .",
    "another important aspect of signal transduction network is _ adaptation _ which means that the response ( probability per unit time of ccw / cw rotation of flagella ) returns to baseline levels on a time scale that is slow compared to excitation , provided that there is no further change in attractant concentration around the cell .",
    "a schematic of the signal transduction pathway is shown in figure pathways and it can be described as follows spiro:1997:mea , stock:1996:c , erban:2004:sts .",
    "aspartate , the attractant most commonly - used in experiments ( denoted s in figure [ pathways ] ) , binds directly to the periplasmic domain of its receptor , tar .",
    "the cytoplasmic domain of tar forms a stable complex with the signaling proteins chea and chew ( denoted a and w , respectively , in figure [ pathways ] ) , and the stability of this complex is not affected by ligand binding @xcite .",
    "the signaling currency is in the form of phosphoryl groups ( -p ) , made available to the chey ( denoted y in figure pathways ) and cheb ( not shown in figure [ pathways ] ) through autophosphorylation of chea .",
    "receptor complexes have two alternative signaling states . in the attractant - bound form ,",
    "the receptor inhibits chea autokinase activity ; in the unliganded form , the receptor stimulates chea activity .",
    "consequently , the response of the signal transduction network to a step increase of the attractant concentration is as follows .",
    "first , the attractant binding to a receptor reduces the autophosphorylation rate of chea .",
    "the level of phosphorylated chea is thus lowered , causing less phosphate to be transferred to chey , yielding a lowered level of chey - p . as a result , tumbling is suppressed , and the cell s run length increases .",
    "this constitutes the _ excitation _ response of the system .",
    "next slow methylation and demethylation reactions begin to influence the response .",
    "ligand - bound receptors are more readily methylated than unliganded receptors , and the lowered level of chea - p causes a decrease in the level of cheb - p , thereby reducing its demethylation activity . as a result , the equilibrium of the system shifts in the direction of the higher methylation states .",
    "the autophosphorylation rate of chea is faster when the associated tar - chea - chew complex is in a higher methylation state , and so there is finally a shift back toward the receptor states containing chea - p . as a result ,",
    "chey - p returns to its prestimulus level , and thus so does the cw bias of the cell .",
    "this constitutes the _ adaptation _ response .",
    "these key steps , excitation via reduction in chey - p , when a receptor is occupied , and adaptation via methylation of the receptors , have been already incorporated in the mathematical models of the bacterial signal transduction @xcite .",
    "since the turning rate of bacterium is altered by chey @xcite , we can write @xmath184 where @xmath159 denotes the concentration of the phosphorylated form of chey .",
    "hence , the individual - based model for bacterial chemotaxis is fully specified by the equation ( [ rom14 ] ) which is integrated along the trajectory of each cell , and by the @xmath159 component of the solution together with @xmath185 .",
    "the essential aspects of the dynamics which must be captured by model ( [ rom14 ] ) are ( i ) it must exhibit excitation , which here means a change in the turning frequency @xmath186 in response to a stimulus , ( ii ) the bias must return to baseline levels ( i.e. , the response must adapt ) on a time scale that is slow compared to excitation , and ( iii ) the signal transduction network should amplify signals appropriately @xcite . the mathematical assumptions on ( [ rom14 ] ) and @xmath186 are given in section secmajorassumptions .      the mathematical model of the signal transduction network ( [ rom14 ] )",
    "can be rewritten in the following form @xmath187the vector function @xmath188 gives signal values which are seen by a cell along its trajectory .",
    "time evolution of @xmath5 in equation ( rom14new ) is controlled by the input time dependent vector @xmath189 therefore , it is natural to describe the behaviour of @xmath38 in terms of the input function @xmath189    the mathematical formulation of the _ adaptation _ property of the signal transduction network ( [ rom14 ] ) can be written in the following form .",
    "there exists a universal constant @xmath190 such that for any constant signal along the trajectory @xmath191 , i.e. @xmath192 and for any initial condition @xmath193 , the solution of the system @xmath48 satisfies @xmath194formula ( [ adaptproperty ] ) describes the perfect adaptation . from the application point of view , it is desirable that the signal transduction model satisfies ( at least approximately ) the adaptation property for a reasonably large set of signals .",
    "however , the existence theorems presented in section [ secglobalexistence ] do not require perfect adaptation and we will prove the existence of solutions even for models which do not satisfy ( [ adaptproperty ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the simplified model of excitation - adaptation dynamics ( [ simmodel ] ) from section [ secmotiv ] satisfied adaptation property ( [ adaptproperty ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath195 as @xmath196 for any constant signal , i.e. @xmath159 adapts perfectly to any constant stimulus . moreover , model ( simmodel ) describes the excitation - adaptation dynamics as discussed in section [ secbache ] provided that we choose @xmath197 . here , the time constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 are labeled in anticipation of using @xmath159 for the internal response , and @xmath160 as the adaptation variable , and therefore we call @xmath54 and @xmath55 the excitation and adaptation time constant , respectively @xcite .    in order to model the random walk of the individual bacterium , we must have a good understanding of the dependence of the ( output ) turning rate @xmath198 on the ( input ) signal function @xmath189 if the input signal function is constant then the behaviour of @xmath186 follows the adaptation property . on the other hand , time",

    "@xmath204let us note that cases ( a ) and ( b ) are considered as definitions of the input - output behaviour in two extreme cases ( these definitions are not connected with any underlying differential equation in this example ) .",

    "if we use input - output behaviour ( a ) , then the cell goes to the right .",
    "it sometimes turns \" to the left but it instantly turns back .",
    "so , the cell spends all the time going to the right , and case ( a ) is an example of the individual - based model where cells perfectly avoid going in wrong directions .",
