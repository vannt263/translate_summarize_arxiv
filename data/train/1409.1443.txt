    "the hydrodynamics of helium  ii is noteworthy for two reasons : its two - fluid nature ( an inviscid superfluid and a viscous normal fluid ) , and the fact that superfluid vorticity is constrained to thin , discrete vortex lines of fixed ( quantized ) circulation @xcite ; in ordinary ( classical ) fluids , by contrast , the vorticity is a continuous field .",
    "turbulence in helium  ii ( called superfluid turbulence , or quantum turbulence ) consists of a three - dimensional tangle of interacting vortex lines .",
    "the properties of this new form of turbulence and current thinking ( in terms of theory and experiments ) have been recently reviewed @xcite .    under certain conditions ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the turbulent tangle is characterized by a single length scale , the average distance @xmath0 between the vortex lines , which is inferred from the experimentally observed vortex line density @xmath1 ( length of vortex line per unit volume ) as @xmath2 .",
    "models based on this property describe fairly well the pioneering experiments of vinen @xcite , in which an applied heat flux drives the superfluid and the normal fluid in opposite directions ( thermal counterflow ) .",
    "more recently , such ` vinen ' tangles were created at very low temperatures by short injections of ions @xcite , exhibiting the characteristic decay @xmath3 predicted by vinen @xcite .",
    "under different conditions , however , the experimental evidence is consistent with a more structured vortex tangle @xcite , where the kinetic energy is distributed over a range of length scales according to the same kolmogorov law which governs ordinary turbulence . ` kolmogorov ' tangles have been generated at high temperatures by stirring liquid helium with grids @xcite or propellers @xcite , and at very low temperatures by an intense injection of ions @xcite , exhibiting the decay @xmath4 expected from the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for these two forms of superfluid turbulence is only indirect and arises from macroscopic observables averaged over the experimental cell , such as pressure @xcite and vortex line density @xcite , not from direct visualization of vortex lines . in a recent paper @xcite we have characterized the energy spectrum of the two forms of turbulence , and showed that kolmogorov turbulence contains metastable , coherent vortex structures @xcite , similar perhaps to the ` worms ' which are observed in ordinary turbulence @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to go a step further , and look for the dynamical origin of the reported spectral difference and coherent structures .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in an incompressible fluid the velocity field @xmath5 is determined by the instantaneous distribution of vorticity @xmath6 via the biot - savart law :    @xmath7    where the integral extends over the entire flow .",
    "the question which we address is whether the velocity at the point @xmath8 is mainly determined by the ( local ) vorticity near @xmath8 or by ( nonlocal ) contributions from further away .",
    "since the quantization of the circulation implies that the velocity field around a vortex line is strictly @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the radial distance from the line ) , from the predominance of local effects we would infer that the vorticity is randomly distributed and nonlocal effects cancel each other out ; conversely , the predominance of nonlocal effects would suggest the existence of coherence structures .",
    "if the vorticity were a continuous field , the distinction between local and nonlocal would involve an arbitrary distance , however in our problem the concentrated nature of vorticity introduces a natural distinction between local and nonlocal contributions , as we shall see .",
    "the two most popular models @xcite for studying superfluid turbulence are the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) and the vortex filament model ( vfm ) .",
    "each has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the main advantage of the gpe over the vfm is that vortex reconnections are solutions of the equation of motion and do not require an ad  hoc algorithmic procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental context of our interest is liquid helium at intermediate temperatures where the effects of the friction are important ( at the chosen value @xmath11 , typical of experiments , the normal fluid fraction is 42 percent ) .",
    "we must keep in mind that , although the gpe is a good quantitative model of weakly interacting atomic gases , it is only an idealized model of liquid helium ; moreover , the gpe applies only at very low temperatures , and there is not yet a consensus@xcite on its finite - temperature generalizations .",
    "this is why , following the approach of schwarz@xcite , we choose to use the vfm and model superfluid vortex lines as space curves @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is time and @xmath14 is arc length ) of infinitesimal thickness and circulation @xmath15 which move according to    @xmath16.\\ ] ]    here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are temperature - dependent friction coefficients @xcite , @xmath19 is the normal fluid velocity , and a prime denotes derivative with respect to arc length ( hence @xmath20 is the local unit tangent vector , and @xmath21 is the local curvature ; the radius of curvature , @xmath22 , is the radius of the osculating circle at the point @xmath23 ) .",
    "the superfluid velocity consists of two parts : @xmath24 .",
    "the former @xmath25 represents any externally applied superflow ; the latter @xmath26 the self - induced velocity at the point @xmath23 , results from equation  [ eq : bs1 ] in the limit of concentrated vorticity :    @xmath27    where the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration @xmath28 .",
    "we discretised the vortex lines into a large number of points @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the minimal separation @xmath31 between the points is such that the vortex curves are sufficiently smooth ( at the temperatures of interest here , the friction , controlled by the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , damps out high frequency perturbations called kelvin waves ) .",
    "the vfm assumes that vortex lines are infinitely thin , thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs2 ] ) is valid only if @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vortex core ( the region around the vortex axis where the superfluid density drops from its bulk value to zero ) .",
    "thus the integral diverges if one attempts to find the velocity at @xmath34 .",
    "as remarked by schwarz , the occurrence of a similar problem in classical hydrodynamics is not helpful , since the physics of the vortex core is different .",
    "the solution to the problem which was proposed by schwarz @xcite and thereafter adopted in the helium literature is based on taylor expanding the integrand around the singularity and comparing against the well - know expression for the self - induced velocity of a circular ring . in this way he obtained a decomposition of the self - induced velocity at the point @xmath29 ( eq .  [ eq : bs2 ] ) into the following local and nonlocal contributions :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the arc lengths of the curves between the point @xmath29 and the adjacent points @xmath38 and @xmath39 along the vortex line .",
    "@xmath40 is the original vortex configuration @xmath28 but now without the section between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the superfluid vortex core radius @xmath41 acts as cutoff parameter .",
    "details and tests of the numerical techniques against the experimental and the numerical literature are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that the local contribution is proportional to @xmath42 , in the binormal direction .",
    "all calculations are performed in a cubic periodic domain of size @xmath43 using an adams - bashforth time - stepping method ( with typical time step @xmath44 ) , a tree - method @xcite with opening angle @xmath45 , and typical minimal resolution @xmath46 .",
    "for example , an increase in the numerical resolution from @xmath47 to @xmath48 produces a small increase of 2.5% in the importance of the nonlocal contribution in fig .",
    "( [ fig:8 ] ) . moreover",
    ", the tests against experiments mentioned above @xcite , guarantee that the numerical resolution is sufficient , and put the distinction between @xmath49 and @xmath50 on solid ground .",
    "it is known from experiments @xcite and from more microscopic models @xcite that colliding vortex lines reconnect with each other .",
    "an algorithmic procedure is introduced to reconnect two vortex lines if they become sufficiently close to each other .",
    "this procedure ( although arbitrary , unlike the gpe as mentioned before ) has been extensively tested @xcite ; various slightly different reconnection algorithms have been proposed and have never been found in disagreement with experimental observations .",
    "we choose a temperature typical of experiments , @xmath51 ( corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . in all three cases ,",
    "the initial condition consists of a few seeding vortex loops , which interact and reconnect , quickly generating a turbulent vortex tangle which appears independent of the initial condition .",
    "we study the following three different regimes of superfluid turbulence , characterized by the following forms of the normal fluid s velocity field",
    "@xmath54 :    1 .",
    "* uniform normal flow . *",
    "firstly , to model turbulence generated by a small heat flux at the blocked end of a channel ( thermal counterflow ) , we impose a uniform normal fluid velocity @xmath55 in the x - direction ( which we interpret as the direction of the channel ) which is proportional to the applied heat flux ; to conserve mass , we add a uniform superflow @xmath56 in the opposite direction , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the normal fluid and superfluid densities .",
    "( [ eq : schwarz ] ) and ( [ eq : bs3 ] ) are solved in the imposed superflow s reference frame .",
    "this model is the most used in the literature , from the pioneering work of schwarz @xcite to the recent calculations of tsubota and collaborators @xcite .",
    "* synthetic turbulence . * to model turbulence generated by pushing helium through pipes or channels @xcite using plungers or bellows or by stirring it with grids @xcite or propellers @xcite , we start from the observation that , due to liquid helium s small viscosity @xmath59 , the normal fluid s reynolds number @xmath60 is usually large ( where @xmath61 is the rms velocity and @xmath62 the kinematic viscosity ) , hence we expect the normal fluid to be turbulent .",
    "we assume @xmath63 and @xcite + @xmath64 + where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are wavevectors and @xmath67 are angular frequencies .",
    "the random parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are chosen so that the normal fluid s energy spectrum obeys kolmogorov s scaling @xmath71 in the inertial range @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to the outer scale of the turbulence and the dissipation length scale respectively . then we define the reynolds number via @xmath75 . the synthetic turbulent flow defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) is solenoidal , time - dependent , and compares well with lagrangian statistics obtained in experiments and direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "it is therefore physically realistic and numerically convenient to model current experiments on grid or propeller generated superfluid turbulence .",
    "* frozen navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "* synthetic turbulence , being essentially the superposition of random waves , lacks the intense regions of concentrated vorticity which are typical of classical turbulence @xcite . for this reason we consider a third model : a turbulent flow @xmath54 obtained by direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the classical navier - stokes equation in a periodic box with no mean flow . since the simultaneous calculation of superfluid vortices and turbulent normal",
    "fluid would be prohibitively expensive , we limit ourselves to a time snapshot of @xmath54 . in other words",
    ", we determine the vortex lines under a frozen  turbulent normal fluid .",
    "our source for the dns data is the john hopkins turbulence database @xcite , which consists of a velocity field on a @xmath76 spatial mesh .",
    "the estimated reynolds number is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the integral scale and @xmath79 the kolmogorov scale . although @xmath80 is not a very large reynolds number , at @xmath11 helium s viscosity is @xmath81 , the normal fluid density is @xmath82 , the kinematic viscosity is @xmath83 @xcite , and therefore @xmath84 corresponds to the reasonable speed @xmath85 in a typical @xmath86 channel . to keep the resulting vortex line density of this model to a computationally practical value , we rescale the velocity components such that they are 60 percent of their original values , thus obtaining the vortex line density @xmath87 . to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] the scaling factor is only 45 percent , yielding @xmath88 ; because of the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation , this procedure is clearly an approximation but is sufficient for our aim of driving a less intense of more intense vortex tangle .",

    "it is apparent that models 1 , 2 and 3 represent a progression of increasing complexity of the driving normal flow . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , note in particular the localized regions of strong velocity which appear in model 3 .",
    "the intensity of the turbulence is measured by the vortex line density @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the superfluid vortex length in the volume @xmath93 ) , which we monitor for a sufficiently long time , such that the properties which we report , refer to a statistically steady state of turbulence fluctuating about a certain average @xmath1 ( we choose parameters so that @xmath1 is typical of experiments ) .",

    "[ fig:2 ] . in terms of curvature , the tangles generated by models 1 and 2 are more similar to each other - the average curvature is almost twice as large as for model 3 , indicating that the vortex lines are more in the form of small loops .    however , vortex line density ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , visual inspection ( fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) and curvature ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] ) do not carry information about the _ orientation _ of the vortex lines , a crucial ingredient of the dynamics .",

    "the energy spectrum describes the distribution of kinetic energy over the length scales .",
    "the spectra of the tangles generated by synthetic normal flow turbulence ( model 2 ) and by the frozen navier - stokes turbulence ( model 3 ) are consistent with the classical kolmogorov scaling @xmath110 for @xmath111 ; the kinetic energy is clearly concentrated at the largest length scales ( small @xmath109 ) .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of the tangle generated by the uniform normal fluid ( model 1 ) peaks at the intermediate length scales , and at large wavenumbers is consistent with the shallower @xmath112 dependence of individual vortex lines .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether our results are affected by the particular vortex reconnection algorithm used . in principle",
    ", both the large @xmath109 region and the small @xmath109 region of the spectrum could be affected : the former , because vortex reconnections involve changes of the geometry of the vortices at small length scales , the latter because the energy flux may be affected . to rule out this possibility",

    "the localized regions of large energy density correspond to vortex lines which are locally parallel to each other , reinforcing each other s velocity field rather than cancelling it out .",
    "the natural question which we ask is what is the cause of the spectral difference shown in fig .",

    "nonlocal effects are responsible for only 25 percent of the total superfluid velocity field in the tangle generated by the uniform normal fluid ( model 1 ) , for 45 percent in the tangle generated by synthetic normal flow turbulence ( model 2 ) , and for more than 60 percent in the tangle generated by frozen navier - stokes turbulence ( model 3 ) .    finally , we explore the dependence of the result on the vortex line density @xmath1 by generating statistically steady states of turbulence driven by uniform normal fluid ( model 1 ) and synthetic turbulence ( model 2 ) with different values of @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "[ fig:11 ] shows that for model 1 ( uniform normal flow ) the relative importance of nonlocal contributions remains constant at about 25 percent over a wide range of vortex line density , from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , whereas for model 2 ( synthetic normal flow turbulence ) and 3 ( frozen navier  stokes turbulence ) , it increases with @xmath1 .",
    "turbulent vortex tangles can be produced in the laboratory using various means : by imposing a flux of heat , by pushing liquid helium  ii through pipes , or by stirring it with moving objects .",
    "the numerical experiments presented here show that reporting the vortex line density @xmath1 is not enough to characterize the nature of the superfluid turbulence which can be generated in helium  ii .",
    "vortex tangles with the same value of @xmath1 may have very different energy spectra , depending on the normal fluid flow which feeds energy into the vortex lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "if the normal fluid is turbulent , energy is contained in the large eddies and is distributed over the length scales consistent with the classical @xmath121 kolmogorov law at large @xmath109 , suggesting the presence of a richardson cascade . if the normal fluid is uniform , most of the energy is contained at the intermediate length scales , and the energy spectrum scales consistently with @xmath112 at large @xmath109 . using a terminology already in the literature , we identify these two forms of superfluid turbulence as ` kolmogorov tangles ' and ` vinen tangles ' respectively .",
    "the superfluid velocity field is determined by the instantaneous configuration of vortex lines . since the superfluid velocity field decays only as @xmath9 away from the axis of a quantum vortex line ,",

    "nonlocal effects are dominant and increase with the vortex line density ; this stronger vortex - vortex interaction leads to the clustering of vortex lines , for which the vortex tangle is much less homogeneous and contains coherent vorticity regions , in analogy to what happens in ordinary turbulence .",

    "<S> in turbulent superfluid he ii , the quantized vortex lines interact via the classical biot  savart law to form a complicated vortex tangle . </S>",
    "<S> we show that vortex tangles with the same vortex line density will have different energy spectra , depending on the normal fluid which feeds energy into the superfluid component , and identify the spectral signature of two forms of superfluid turbulence : kolmogorov tangles and vinen tangles . by decomposing the superfluid velocity field into local and nonlocal contributions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in vinen tangles the motion of vortex lines depends mainly on the local curvature , whereas in kolmogorov tangles the long - range vortex interaction is dominant and leads to the formation of clustering of lines , in analogy to the worms  of ordinary turbulence . </S>"
