    "lanthanum cobalt oxide lacoo@xmath0 exhibits magnetic - electronic transitions around 100 and 500 k. @xcite in order to explain these two transitions consistently , a two - stage spin - state transition model has been proposed . within the model , the 100 k transition is associated with the thermal excitation of co@xmath4 ions from the low spin ( ls ; @xmath5 ) ground state to an intermediate spin ( is ; @xmath6 ) state , whereas the 500 k transition corresponds to a crossover from the is state to a mixed state of is and the high spin ( hs ; @xmath7 ) state.@xcite reducing the volume either by hydrostatic pressure@xcite or by subsitution of rare - earth elements,@xcite with a smaller ionic radius , for la causes the spin - state transitions to move to higher temperature , and makes the two transitions less distiguishable .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite were the first to show theoretically that the is state is energetically close to the ls state due to a large hybridization between co-@xmath8 and o-@xmath9 orbitals . in a purely ionic picture , however , the ground state of co@xmath4 ions is either the ls state ( @xmath10 ) or the hs state ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the crystal - field splitting and the intra - atomic exchange interaction , respectively .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been argued that the is state might be understood by including spin - orbit effects in the purely ionic model,@xcite and comparisons have been made with electron - spin - resonance measurements.@xcite thus , the nature of the is - state co@xmath4 is still controversial .    the 100-k spin - state transition couples with phonons .",
    "in fact , lattice anomalies correlated with the spin - state transition have been reported .",
    "the lattice volume shows an anomalous expansion of about 1%  around 100 k. @xcite the elastic constant measured by longitudinal ultrasound shows a dip of about 30%  in magnitude around 100 k , suggesting a softening associated with coexistence of the ls and the is - states of co@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in addition , it is expected that the hybridization - induced is - state of the co@xmath4 ion should have an associated jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion , since the @xmath14 orbital is partially occupied .",
    "several experiments suggest the orbital ordering due to the jt distortion .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have reported an anomalous temperature dependence of the intensity and the splitting of the phonon modes with the energies of 35 , 50 and 73 mev based on an infrared spectroscopic study , and proposed a local jt distortion resulting from the appearance of the is - state co@xmath4 .",

    "@xcite the jt distortion increases sharply around 70 k with increasing temperature .",
    "recently , ishikawa _ et al .",
    "_ have reported an energy shift and broadening associated with the population of the is - state co@xmath4 ions for the phonons of the @xmath2 rotational mode of o atoms at 11 mev , the @xmath2 vibration mode of la atoms at 21 mev , and the @xmath20 rotational mode of o atoms at 32 mev ( energies are the values at 5 k ) based on the raman scattering experiment . @xcite in addition , they have reported the appearance of the satellite peaks associated with the is - state at the energies of 19 , 45 and 84 mev with increasing temperature .",
    "based on the results , they supported the orbital ordering due to the cooperative jt distortion proposed by maris _",
    "@xcite these studies show that the investigation of the phonons is of paramount importance in understanding the spin - state transition .",
    "it is important to clarify the phonon dispersion over the brillouin zone in order to investigate the coupling between the phonons and the spin - state transition .",

    "@xcite the phonon dispersion in the rhombohedral phase of the perovskite oxide over the whole brillouin zone has not been reported to our knowledge although many studies of the soft - phonon mode near the structural phase transition in the cubic phase of laalo@xmath0 have been reported .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we report the inelastic neutron scattering study on lacoo@xmath0 single crystal in order to determine the phonon dispersion and find the phonon anomaly associated with the spin - state transition of lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the phonon scattering , we have investigated the inelastic magnetic neutron scattering associated with the energy gap between the ls and the is state , which has been reported to be about 16 mev.@xcite",
    "single crystals of lacoo@xmath0 were grown with a lamp - image floating zone furnace by melting polycrystalline samples prepared by a solid - state - reaction of predried la@xmath23o@xmath0 and coo . @xcite laue photographs confirmed that each sample is a proper single crystal .",
    "lacoo@xmath0 has a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure with the crystal space group of @xmath17 which contains two chemical formula units .",
    "since the crystal contains four twins , each of which has the principal axis parallel to one of the @xmath24-axes of the pseudo - cubic unit cell , and the rhombohedral distortion of the crystal from the cubic structure is small , we use the crystallographic indices based on the pseudo - cubic cell ( @xmath25   and @xmath26 at 295 k @xcite ) containing one molecule of lacoo@xmath0 . we must mention that the r - point of the pseudo - cubic brillouin zone ( 0.5 0.5 0.5 ) is the zone center ( @xmath21-point ) of the rhombohedral one due to the brillouin zone folding .",
    "a rod of the single crystal with about 5 mm in diameter and about 40 mm in length and an assembly of similar four rods were used for the measurement at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and jaeri , respectively .",

    "after preliminary measurements on prisma at isis in rutherford appleton laboratory in 2003 , the detailed inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed on a triple - axis spectrometer topan at jrr-3 m in jaeri , tokai .",
    "both tas experiments were performed with fixed final neutron energies ( @xmath29 ) of 30.5 and 14.7 mev , but the horizontal collimation was 40-40-40-80 for the bnl measurement and 30-100-60-blank and blank-60-60-60 , respectively for the jaeri measurement .",
