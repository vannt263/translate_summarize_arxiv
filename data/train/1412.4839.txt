    "the optimization of trading strategies has long been an important goal for investors in financial markets . as demonstrated in the context of a linear equilibrium model by kyle almost thirty years ago @xcite ,",
    "the optimal strategy for an investor with insider information on the fundamental price of an asset is to trade incrementally through time .",
    "this strategy allows the trader to minimize costs whilst also minimizing the revelation of information to the rest of the market . the precise way in which it is optimal to split the large order ( herein called _ metaorder _ )",
    "@xcite depends on the objective function and on the market impact model , _",
    "i.e. _ the change in price conditioned on signed trade size . in part due to the increasing tendency toward a full automation of exchanges and in part due to the discovery of new statistical regularities of the microstructure of financial markets , the problem of optimal execution is receiving growing attention from the academic and practitioner communities @xcite .    as pointed out in gatheral et al .",
    "@xcite , a first generation of market impact models @xcite distinguishes between two impact components .",
    "the first component is temporary and only affects the individual trade that has triggered it .",
    "the second component is permanent and affects all current and future trades equally .",
    "these models can be either in discrete or in continuous time and can assume either linear or nonlinear market impact for individual trades . the second generation of market impact models focusses on the _ transient _ nature of market impact @xcite . in such models ,",
    "market impact is typically assumed to factorize into two components : instantaneous market impact and a decay component .",
    "the instantaneous component models the reaction of price to traded volume .",
    "the decay component describes how the market price relaxes on average after the execution of an order . in such models , each trade affects future price dynamics with an intensity that decays with time .    the problem of optimal execution in the presence of transient impact has been considered in a series of recent studies . in the case of linear instantaneous market impact @xcite , the problem has been completely solved by showing that the cost minimization problem is equivalent to solving an integral equation . in particular gatheral et al .",
    "@xcite proved that optimal strategies can be characterized as measure - valued solutions of a fredholm integral equation of the first kind .",
    "they show that optimal strategies always exist and are nonalternating between buy and sell trades when price impact decays as a convex function of time .",
    "this extends the result of alfonsi et al .",
    "@xcite on the non existence of transaction triggered price manipulation , _",
    "i.e _ strategies where the expected execution costs of a sell ( buy ) program can be decreased by intermediate buy ( sell ) trades .",
    "however , a series of empirical studies @xcite has clearly shown that the instantaneous market impact is a strongly concave function of the volume , well approximated by a power law function .",
    "the resulting optimal execution problem in the presence of nonlinear and transient impact is mathematically much more complicated than the linear case . in this paper",
    "we consider this optimization problem and propose several methods to find optimal solutions .",
    "some important results in the nonlinear transient case were established by gatheral @xcite who showed that under certain conditions , the model admits price manipulation , _",
    "i.e. _ the existence of round trip strategies with positive expected revenues .",
    "this money machine should of course be avoided in the modeling of market impact . in particular gatheral set some necessary conditions for the absence of price manipulation ( see below for details ) .",
    "a step toward the solution of the optimal execution problem under nonlinear transient impact has been made recently by dang @xcite . in his paper , dang suggests a way to convert the cost minimization problem into a nonlinear integral equation and proposes a numerical fixed point method on a discretization of the trading time interval to solve this equation . as we discuss in detail below",
    ", we find that dang s fixed point method has convergence problems when the degree of nonlinearity of impact is significant and/or when the discretization grid is fine enough .    in this paper",
    "we propose two methods to solve the optimal execution under nonlinear transient impact .",
    "the first is based on the homotopy analysis method ( ham ) @xcite applied to the discretized version of the integral equation proposed by dang @xcite .",
    "the method starts from an initial guess and deforms it continuously in order to find better and better approximations of the solution of the integral equation . in doing this",
    ", we are implicitly restricting the space of solutions to continuous nonvanishing functions of the trading rate .",
    "we find that the optimal solution is a non time - symmetric u - shape ; in the case of concave ( convex ) instantaneous impact , it is optimal to trade more at the beginning ( end ) of the metaorder . a comparative cost analysis shows that our solution outperforms conventional strategies .",
    "once again , the ham method explores only a restricted subspace of possible solutions . for this reason , in the second part of the paper we consider a fully numerical cost optimization method on a discrete grid . by using sequential quadratic programming ( sqp )",
    "we minimize directly the cost functional ( _ i.e. _ we do not try to solve the integral equation ) .",
    "we find that the cost landscape is rugged , _",
    "i.e. _ composed by a very large number of local minima separated by peaks",
    ". a significant number of these minima correspond to strategies with similar costs ; for a buy program the corresponding strategy is an alternation of intense and short bursts of buying periods and long periods of weak selling . in other words ,",
    "the model admits transaction triggered price manipulation .",
    "more important , when the nonlinearity is strong and/or the partition is fine , some such strategies have a negative expected cost , indicating that the model admits price manipulation .",
    "we then further extend our analysis by minimizing the cost functional with the extra constraint that all trades should have the same sign , so that for example selling is disallowed during execution of a buy metaorder .",
    "this case requires a derivative - free optimization method . by using a direct - search method , namely the generating set search ( gss ) method",
    ", we find positive expected execution costs and _ sparse _ optimal strategies , _",
    "i.e. _ it is optimal to trade with a few bursts at a high trading rate interspersed with long periods of no - trading .    in order to eliminate negative cost solutions ,",
    "we propose two ways of regularizing the model , one based on the addition of a spread cost and one based on a modification of the instantaneous impact function . in the latter case",
    "the function becomes convex for sufficiently high trading rates .",
    "both methods succeed in avoiding solution with negative costs and obviously reflect features of real markets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ gatheral s model and fredholm integral equations ] , we state the problem and explain why it is difficult to solve .",
    "we also briefly summarize our results on the convergence of the dang fixed point method . in section [ sec : homotopy ] , we present the ham approach to the solution of the cost minimization problem and in section [ sec : generalpiecewise ] we present our results on the sqp and direct - search brute force minimization of the cost function .",
    "section [ regularize ] presents two proposed regularization methods . in section [ conclusions ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the model of nonlinear transient market impact for the price @xmath0 of an order execution starting at time @xmath1 when the price is @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rate of trading , _",
    "i.e. _ number of shares per unit of time , at time @xmath5 , @xmath6 represents the impact of trading at time @xmath7 , and @xmath8 describes the impact decay .",
    "finally , @xmath9 is the volatility and @xmath10 is a wiener process .",
    "thus @xmath0 follows an arithmetic random walk with a drift that depends on the accumulated impacts of previous trades .",
    "we refer to @xmath11 as the _ instantaneous market impact function _ and to @xmath12 as the _ decay kernel_. in discrete time this is the propagator model originally developed by bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite ; the above continuous time formulation is due to gatheral @xcite .",
    "more recently , bacry et al.@xcite have shown how a market impact model of the form may be related to a more fundamental description of order flow using hawkes processes .",
    "the optimal execution problem consists in finding the trading strategy @xmath13}$ ] that minimizes the execution cost for a given total amount @xmath14 of shares to be traded .",
    "the expected cost @xmath15 $ ] associated with a given strategy @xmath16 is given by @xmath17=\\mathbb{e}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\dot x\\left(t\\right)\\left(s\\left(t\\right)-s_{0}\\right)dt\\right]=\\int_{0}^{t}\\dot x\\left(t\\right)\\,\\int_{0}^{t}f\\left(\\dot x\\left(s\\right)\\right)g\\left(t - s\\right)ds\\,dt,\\ ] ] and the constraint that all shares should be traded is @xmath18 expression for the expected cost corresponds to expected implementation shortfall .",
    "we search for a statically optimal strategy .",
    "a statically optimal strategy is also dynamically optimal when the cost depends on the stock price only trough the term @xmath19 , with @xmath0 a martingale @xcite .",
    "thus for the model of and the cost function described by , a statically optimal strategy is also dynamically optimal .",
    "the @xmath20 shares traded at time @xmath21 are traded at an expected price @xmath22 which represents the cumulative impact of prior trading up to time @xmath21 .",
    "the impact model of equation is fully specified by the form of the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a large body of empirical evidences points out two empirical facts on the form of these two functions .",
    "first , the instantaneous impact function @xmath25 is strongly concave .",
    "for example , based on a large sample of nyse stocks , lillo et al .",
    "@xcite observed a concave function of the transaction volume .",
    "the concave function is well fitted by a power law with exponent 0.5 for small volumes and 0.2 for large volumes .",
    "bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed stocks traded at the paris bourse and found that a logarithmic form gave the best fit to the data .",
    "in addition ( in @xcite for example ) , the decay kernel @xmath26 is found to decay asymptotically as a power law function @xmath27    the presence of these nonlinearities raises the question of the possible presence of price manipulation .",
    "there are different forms of manipulation .",
    "following @xcite , we define a _ price manipulation _ as a round trip trade whose expected cost is negative .",
    "an impact model is free from price manipulation if , for any round trip trade , _",
    "i.e. _ a strategy with @xmath28 , the expected cost is non negative . according to proposition 1 of @xcite , the model of equation",
    "admits price manipulation in the nonlinear case unless the decay kernel @xmath29 is singular for @xmath30 . for these reasons we will focus our analysis on decay kernels of the form @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , as shown by gatheral @xcite , the requirement of no price manipulation restricts the class of possible joint form for the instantaneous impact and decay kernel .",
    "specifically , for power law impact function , @xmath32 , and a power - law kernel , @xmath31 , the following conditions @xmath33 are _ necessary _ for the absence of price manipulations . in this paper",
    "we always consider parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfying the above conditions .",
    "however , if these conditions are satisfied , there is no guarantee that the impact model does not admit price manipulation . later in the paper we will show that it is indeed the case that the above conditions are not sufficient to preclude price manipulation",
    ". a weaker form of price manipulation , relevant for our paper , is the _ transaction - triggered _ price manipulation defined in @xcite .",
    "this occurs when the expected revenues of a buy(sell ) program may be increased by intermediate sell(buy ) trades .",
    "the optimization problem of minimizing the expected cost of equation under the constraint of equation in the case of linear impact , @xmath36 , has been solved and widely studied @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we use the symbol @xmath37 to indicate the rate of trading @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , proposition 22.9 of ref .",
    "@xcite states that if @xmath24 is positive definite , then @xmath39 minimizes the expected cost if and only if there is a @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , @xmath39 solves @xmath42 as an important example , relevant for this paper , is the case @xmath31 where the integral equation becomes the abel equation with solution @xmath43^{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is uniquely determined by the constraint equation as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is euler s gamma function .",
    "this solution is u - shaped and symmetric under time reversal , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath47 , @xmath48 $ ] . in the following",
    "we will refer to this solution as the gss solution .      in the general nonlinear case ,",
    "the problem is mathematically much more complicated .",
    "a first step in this direction has been presented very recently by dang @xcite and consists in two contributions .",
    "the first one is the use of calculus of variations for integrals depending on convolution products @xcite to transform the cost minimization problem into an integral equation generalizing .",
    "specifically , given @xmath49 and @xmath50 $ ] , for the class of functions @xmath51 on @xmath52 $ ] satisfying    * @xmath51 is absolutely continuous on @xmath53 , * @xmath54 $ ] ,    the following necessary condition for the stationarity of the functional of equation holds : @xmath55 where again @xmath40 is a constant set by the constraint equation .    in the case of a convex impact function ,",
    "@xmath56 with @xmath57 , equation holds @xmath58 . in contrast , in the concave case , @xmath59 , equation is not defined if the trading velocity @xmath60 vanishes at some time @xmath21 , because the derivative of @xmath23 diverges at zero .",
    "this observation restricts the class of trajectories that can be considered .",
    "moreover in the concave case there is no guarantee that the necessary condition is also sufficient , because the minimization cost problem could have a large number of extremal points    the condition of equation is a stationarity condition for the cost functional only when @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ only for @xmath62 or @xmath63 , because the derivative of @xmath23 diverges in zero .",
    "* we can find only strategies described by trading rates of definite sign .",
    "non potrebbe saltare ed essere discontinua ? in the concave case",
    "we do not have guarantees that the equation describes the global minimum of the cost functional , we can only find a local minimum .",
    "chi ci dice che non e vero per convex ? *    equation is a weakly singular urysohn equation of the first kind @xcite taking the form @xmath64 where @xmath65    note that there are two sources of nonlinearity in the integral equation : the nonlinear impact function @xmath66 , and the function @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , the nonlinearity depends also on the first derivative of the impact function @xmath68 , _",
    "i.e. _ on the response of price to the traded volume per unit time . moreover , the term involving @xmath69 entangles the response of price at time @xmath21 with the future trading rates , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath70 for @xmath71 , _",
    "i.e. _ a coupling between present and future values of @xmath60 .",
    "this means that equation can not be classified as a weakly singular nonlinear fredholm equation , because the function @xmath67 depends both on @xmath21 and on @xmath7 . in the linear impact case ,",
    "both nonlinearities disappear and one recovers a weakly singular linear fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the trading rate , where there is no such coupling between present and future times .",
    "this special form of _ nonlinearity _ makes this integral equation different from standard nonlinear fredholm integral equations of the first kind .",
    "the standard form of the nonlinear fredholm integral equations of the first kind @xcite is given by @xmath72 where the kernel @xmath73 and the function @xmath74 are given real - valued functions , and @xmath75 is a nonlinear function of the unknown function @xmath76 .",
    "this integral equations of first kind are considered an ill - posed problem @xcite because it does not satisfy the following properties : existence of a solution , uniqueness of a solution , and continuous dependence of the solution @xmath76 from the function @xmath74 .",
    "this means that a small change of the function @xmath74 can give a large change in the function @xmath76 . to determine a solution of the equation one usually converts it to a linear fredholm integral equation of the first kind of the form @xmath77 this approach is suitable if the function @xmath78 is an invertible function of its argument .",
    "another method is the tikhonov s _ regularization _ , it received a considerable interest especially in solving first kind integral equations @xcite .",
    "the regularization consists of replacing the ill - posed problem with a well - posed one .",
    "it transforms the integral equation of first kind in a integral equation of second kind dependent from a small parameter @xmath79 @xmath80 and one can find the solution in the limit @xmath81 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that integral equations of the second kind are much simpler to solve with respect to that of first kind @xcite .",
    "other methods can be applied to find a solution of the linear equation , as the augmented galerkin method @xcite or wavelets method @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath67 in equation is not an invertible function of @xmath60 , because it depends not only on @xmath7 but also on @xmath21 .",
    "for this reason , the usual method for solving nonlinear integral equation by setting @xmath82 and solving the linear integral equation for @xmath83 is not applicable here . in section [ sec : homotopy ] , we use the homotopy analysis method to solve the integral equation .      the second contribution of dang @xcite is a numerical scheme to solve the integral equation .",
    "this is a fixed point iteration scheme to find a numerical solution by quadrature methods which we review in appendix [ sec : dangfixedpoint ] .",
    "quadrature relies on a discretization of the time interval @xmath84 $ ] into @xmath85 subintervals , transforming the integral equation into a system of equations for a vector of dimension @xmath85 .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of the convergence properties of dang s fixed point method as a function of the number of subintervals @xmath85 and the deviation of the impact from linearity , as measured by @xmath86 is presented in appendix [ sec : dangfixedpoint ] .",
    "we now summarize the results of this analysis .",
    "the green area described in the left panel of figure [ fig : conv_region&squared_error ] shows the region where our implementation of dang s algorithm converges , while the right panel shows the squared residual error of solutions ( defined in equation for a generic nonlinear operator ) obtained as fixed points of the map .",
    "both panels tell the same story . for small values of the number @xmath85 of subintervals",
    ", the method converges , even if the impact function is strongly nonlinear . as @xmath85 increases , _",
    "i.e _ for finer partitions of the interval , we find that the method converges only for very moderately nonlinear impact functions .",
    "dang s method obviously always converges when @xmath87 , because in this case , the objective function has only one minimum .",
    "that dang s method does not converge is no surprise ; iteration schemes are useful for solving integral equations of the second kind , whilst equation is an integral equation of the first kind .    .",
    "right panel : squared residual error of solutions obtained as map s fixed points.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in summary , dang s proposed solution technique in @xcite is problematic .",
    "first , there is no guarantee that solving the integral equation leads to a strategy that minimizes the expected execution cost over the class of all admissible strategies . in particular , if the impact function is concave , as observed in reality , solutions are restricted to those for which the trading velocity @xmath37 never vanishes , because @xmath88 diverges at @xmath89 .",
    "second , according to our numerical tests , dang s fixed point algorithm seems to converge only for moderate nonlinearity and moderate discretizations of the @xmath84 $ ] interval .",
    "thus we need to investigate alternative approaches .",
    "in the next section we consider a perturbative approach to equation valid for weak nonlinearity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 .",
    "this enables us to gain some understanding of the effect of nonlinearity on the optimal solution . in section [ sec : homotopy ] we present a new approach to the solution of equation using the homotopy method .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : generalpiecewise ] , we will present a brute - force numerical minimization of a discretized version of the cost function , where we will see explicitly that this cost function has many local minima .      in this section",
    "we present a simple perturbative method to investigate the solution of equation in the weakly nonlinear case .",
    "this will provide some intuition for the results we obtain later using the more powerful homotopy method .",
    "our perturbative approach is based on two approximations .",
    "the first one regards the impact function , while the second one regards the trading rate , _",
    "i.e. _ the unknown solution .",
    "let us consider a buy program , @xmath91 and a slightly concave impact function , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",
    "we then make the approximations @xmath94 substituting into equation , and keeping terms only to order @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96\\,\\int_{t}^{t}\\,v\\left ( s\\right)\\,g\\left ( s - t\\right)\\,ds\\right\\rbrace = \\lambda . \\end{split}\\ ] ] as mentioned earlier , the gss solution solves the zeroth order case of @xmath97 in closed form .     and @xmath98 .",
    "the full line represents the solution @xmath99 .",

    "we search for @xmath103 iteratively until equation is satisfied to within some given precision , in our case @xmath105 of @xmath14 .",
    "an example of this perturbative solution is shown in figure [ fig : weakcuratogatheral ] .",
    "we use the quadrature method described in section [ sec : discretehomotopy ] to discretize the kernel @xmath24 and perform matrix inversion to solve a discretized version of equation .",
    "we report here the case @xmath106 and @xmath98 using a quadrature grid with @xmath107 points .",
    "our first observation is that when market impact is concave , the optimal strategy is no longer symmetric under time reversal , in contrast to the linear case .",
    "indeed , it is better to trade faster in the first half of the trading period @xmath108 and more slowly in the second half . repeating the computation in the convex market impact case ,",
    "one obtains the opposite behavior : it is better to trade faster in the second half , as found also in @xcite with the fixed point method . in section [ sec : homotopy ] , we will observe that the numerical solution of in the strongly nonlinear impact case using the homotopy method has the same properties .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that there is no reason to believe that a solution of the integral equation gives the optimal execution strategy , corresponding to the global minimum of the expected cost .",
    "the concept of homotopy can be traced back to henri poincar . in short ,",
    "a homotopy describes a _ continuous _ variation or deformation . for example , a circle can be continuously deformed into a square or an ellipse , a coffee cup can be continuously deformed into a doughnut but not into a ball . more formally ,",
    "let us consider the following general nonlinear equation : @xmath109=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is a nonlinear operator , @xmath21 denotes the independent variable , and @xmath76 is the unknown function .",

    "@xmath114 is an auxiliary function , @xmath115 is an auxiliary linear operator , @xmath116 is an initial guess of @xmath76 , and @xmath117 is an unknown function .",
    "there are no particular prescriptions for the choice of auxiliary functions or operators ; often the choice depends on the problem to be solved .",
    "when @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we have respectively @xmath120 thus , as @xmath121 increases from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , the solution @xmath117 varies _ continuously _ from the initial guess @xmath116 to the sought solution @xmath76 .",
    "expanding @xmath117 in a maclaurin series with respect to @xmath121 , we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 the series representation of @xmath126 in equation is called the homotopy series and @xmath127 in is called the @xmath128th - order homotopy derivative of @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "if the auxiliary linear operator , the initial guess , the convergence control parameter @xmath113 , and the auxiliary function are properly chosen , the homotopy series converges at @xmath119 , giving the sought solution of equation .",
    "then by using the relationship @xmath129 , one has the so - called homotopy series solution @xmath130 which is one of the solutions of the original nonlinear equation , as proved by liao @xcite .",
    "defining the vector @xmath131 and differentiating the zero - order deformation equation @xmath128 times with respect to the homotopy parameter @xmath121 and then setting @xmath118 and finally dividing them by @xmath132 , we have the so - called @xmath128th - order deformation equation @xmath133=\\hslash\\ , h\\left(t\\right ) r^{m}\\left(\\textbf{v}^{m-1}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath134}{\\partial p^{m-1}}\\big|_{p=0}\\ ] ] and @xmath135 the @xmath136th - order approximate solution is then given by @xmath137 and the exact solution by @xmath138 .",
    "the two main difficulties of this approach are to compute the derivatives of equation and how to choose an appropriate value of @xmath113 in order to guarantee the convergence of the series solution of equation .",
    "the first problem requires us to compute the homotopy derivative of a given nonlinear smooth function @xmath23 of the homotopy maclaurin series of equation , _",
    "i.e. _ to compute the derivative of @xmath139 .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix [ apphomo ] for details .",
    "the second problem is how to choose an appropriate value of the convergence control parameter @xmath113 in order to guarantee the convergence of the series of equation @xcite . to do this",
    ", we will adopt in the following , the so - called _ optimization _ method @xcite , according to which , we define the squared residual of the governing equation as @xmath140\\right)^2dt.\\ ] ] the optimal value of the convergence control parameter is then obtained by finding the minimum of this squared residual .",
    "in fact , if @xmath141 is the solution of the original problem of equation , the residual @xmath142 vanishes .",
    "now we apply the homotopy analysis method ( ham ) to the solution of the nonlinear integral equation .",

    "we also focused our attention on the presence of different forms of possible price manipulation .",
    "if the class of admissible strategies is constrained so as to eliminate the possibility of zero trading rates , the cost minimization problem may be cast as an urysohn integral equation of the first kind . to solve for the optimal execution strategy with this constraint , we proposed a discretized homotopy analysis technique .",

    "in particular , for a buy program the optimal solution consists of short bursts of trading at high rates separated by long periods of selling at low trading rates .",
    "even worse , when the nonlinearity is strong and when the discretization is sufficiently fine , we find negative execution costs .",

    "we add a spread cost , effectively performing a @xmath213 or lasso regularization , which discourages negative trades for buy programs . in the presence of sufficiently strong transaction costs ,",
    "the optimal execution strategy no longer exhibits a negative expected cost , and the optimal buy strategy becomes sparse and bursty , with a few moments of strong positive trading separated by periods of zero or slightly negative trading . in the second approach ,",
    "we add to the market impact function a convex component which makes it very costly to trade at high trading rates .",
    "we observe that if the convex component is sufficiently large , negative expected execution costs are again eliminated .",

    "<S> we study the problem of the optimal execution of a large trade in the presence of nonlinear transient impact . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an approach based on homotopy analysis , whereby a well behaved initial strategy is continuously deformed to lower the expected execution cost . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the optimal solution is front loaded for concave impact and that its expected cost is significantly lower than that of conventional strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider brute force numerical optimization of the cost functional ; we find that the optimal solution for a buy program typically features a few short intense buying periods separated by long periods of weak selling . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> in some cases we find negative expected cost . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this undesirable characteristic of the nonlinear transient impact model may be mitigated either by introducing a bid - ask spread cost or by imposing convexity of the instantaneous market impact function for large trading rates . </S>"
