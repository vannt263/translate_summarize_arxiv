    "as in the proof of ( [ mainest2 ] ) , we use the symmetry in @xmath1190 and @xmath1191 to deduce that @xmath1192 however , the estimation of the kernel in this case does not exactly follow the treatment of ( [ mainest2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that unlike @xmath1025 , the curve @xmath911 for @xmath1193 need not be well - curved , and in particular this means that we do not always have the lower bound on the curvature that led to ( [ lower - bound - curv ] ) .",
    "we explain this below in greater detail .",
    "the equation for @xmath909 is given by @xmath1194 for @xmath1195 , the angular separation between @xmath23 and @xmath958 is @xmath1196 , and by our choice @xmath1197 .",

    "if @xmath1206 ( for some small constant @xmath553 to be determined in the sequel ) , then once again we can use the lower bound @xmath1207 of the curvature and summation techniques similar to the ones used in the proof of ( [ mainest2 ] ) to obtain the desired sum of @xmath1208 .",
    "we therefore concentrate only on the case @xmath1209 , where curvature does not help any longer .",
