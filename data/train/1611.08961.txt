    "as theoretically predicted in @xcite and experimentally discovered in @xcite , two - band solid state systems in 3d can host topologically protected `` weyl semimetallic phases '' in which the quasiparticle excitations at the band crossings ( `` weyl points '' ) share some features with weyl fermions from relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the experimental signature , namely `` fermi arcs '' of surface states which connect the projected weyl points in the surface brillouin zone , is just as remarkable .",
    "based on this initial success , much effort has been put into the general study of topological semimetallic phases in the hope of predicting and eventually realising new exotic fermionic quasiparticles in condensed matter systems .",
    "most proposals have focused on _ local _ aspects in the sense of finding new types of topological obstructions to locally opening up gaps in semimetal band crossings .",
    "staying in the two - band case , there are generalisations of the basic weyl semimetal phase to `` type - ii '' ones @xcite , as well as `` quadratic '' ones @xcite .",
    "one can consider model hamiltonians with more than two bands and in a different number of spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "following the example set by topological insulator theory , one may also introduce antiunitary symmetry constraints such as time - reversal and charge - conjugation @xcite . to circumvent certain difficulties in achieving non - trivial obstructions , point symmetries",
    "were also introduced into the game , and a host of possibilities arise @xcite .",
    "our results in this paper have a different focus , concentrating on ( 1 ) isolating in a conceptually simple but rigorous way the general mathematical mechanism allowing for local semimetallic charges , ( 2 ) providing the full _ global _ topological characterisation of semimetal band structures , fermi arcs , and the relation to topological insulator invariants , and ( 3 ) introducing a new family of semimetals whose topological invariants have a very different character to those commonly used in the literature .",
    "figure [ fig : flowchart ] summarises the physical and mathematical concepts which we introduce in this paper .    ) which are dual to each other.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    with regards to ( 1 ) , we see , with much hindsight , that the local topological charges protecting basic types of semimetal crossings are completely inherited from the singular vector field which specifies the hamiltonian @xcite . the poincar  hopf theorem @xcite then shows how the brillouin zone topology forces a global charge cancellation condition , and the prediction of fermi arcs becomes a corollary of the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "this brings us to point ( 2 ) .",
    "while the 3d weyl semimetal may be intuitively understood using a stokes theorem argument to predict `` jumps '' in 2d chern numbers across the weyl points , there are several subtleties involved , not the least of which is the fact that the local charges ( equal to the jumps ) fail to completely characterise the semimetal , and can not predict , a priori , the fermi arc topology @xcite .",
    "it is here that the finer topology of the brillouin torus comes into play : the fact that @xmath0 has non - trivial cycles means that `` the ( fermi ) arc joining two weyl points '' is an ambiguous notion , even up to deformations of the arc ( contrast with the simply - connected spheres ) .",
    "the resolution of this ambiguity requires additional global data which captures the full topology of semimetal band structures , and is closely related to the concept of euler structures introduced by turaev to resolve ambiguities in torsions of reidemeister type @xcite ; both hinge on the fact that the first homology of the underlying manifold may be non - zero . by considering a homological version of _ euler structures _",
    "@xcite , we find that the language of _ euler chains _ very concisely represents all the _ topological _ features of a semimetal .",
    "the euler chain representation directly predicts the _ topology _ of the fermi arcs , and the latter are the experimental signature of a topological semimetal .",
    "furthermore , the notion of topological equivalence between semimetals becomes clear in this language .",
    "a semimetal hamiltonian determines a fermi arc , e.g.  through a transfer matrix formalism @xcite , and this determination descends to the level of topological invariants in the sense that equivalent hamiltonians give rise to equivalent fermi arcs .",
    "having isolated the basic mathematical principles underlying the geometry and topology of semimetals , we move on to ( 3 ) : the generalisation of our theory for 2-frames or 2 vector fields along the lines of the atiyah  dupont theorem @xcite which is the analogue of the poincar ",
    "hopf theorem in this context , where the _ kervaire semicharacteristic _ plays the role of the euler characteristic .",
    "it is a topological invariant of a very different nature to those that had been previously utilised in the literature on topological phases ( e.g.  chern classes and related characteristic classes , @xmath1-theory , winding numbers / degrees ) .",
    "this leads us to define some new mathematical notions  _ kervaire structures _ and _ kervaire chains _  which are two mutually dual objects characterising a new class of @xmath2-topological semimetals introduced for the first time in this paper , experimentally predicting torsion fermi arcs .      in section [ sec : physback ] , we give a quick overview of the use of cohomological characteristic classes to study topological insulating phases , and then connect it to semimetal phases via the mayer  vietoris technique of `` patching together '' the non - singular portion ( avoiding the weyl points ) and topologically trivial portions ( small neighbourhoods of the weyl points ) .",
    "the basic `` semimetal mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence '' is given a geometric interpretation as an extension problem , parallel to the physical problem of deforming a semimetal band structure into a globally insulating one , in section [ sec : extension ] . in section [ sec : euler ] , we introduce the concept of euler structures and the euler chain representation of a semimetal .",
    "we illustrate with diagrams the basic intuitive ideas , and apply the euler chain concept to fermi arc topology and their rewirings . in section [ sec : higherdimension ] , we study dirac - type hamiltonians parametrised by singular vector fields , emphasising the merits of an abstract coordinate - free analysis with regards to symmetry considerations . in particular , we justify the generality of dirac - type hamiltonians through natural symmetry constraints , in order to avoid introducing `` spurious topology '' through ad - hoc parametrisations of toy model hamiltonians . in section [ sec : semimetalgerbe ] , a geometric connection to gerbes is made in the 4d case , and in section [ sec:5dsemimetal ] , the connection to quaternionic valence bundles in 5d is made , and the geometric interpretation as an extension problem is in section [ sec : extension ] . in section [ sec : torsionsemimetal ] , we introduce a new class of semimetals modelled on hamiltonians which are bilinear in gamma matrices .",
    "the topology of such semimetals is characterised by the notion of kervaire structures and chains , and we predict an interesting phenomenon of @xmath2 surface fermi arcs .",
