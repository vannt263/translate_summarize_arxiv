    "kaons are pseudoscalar mesons containing strangeness .",
    "strangeness is a property of some baryons and mesons which at their discovery had ` strange ' long lifetime compared to the nuclear resonances known at that time .",
    "the quark model explained that property by the content of a strange ( anti)quark .",
    "normal nuclear matter - protons , neutrons and ( following the old yukawa idea ) pions - are build up by two types of quarks , the so - called _",
    "up- _ and _ down _ quarks .",
    "a further quark the so - called _ strange _ quark allows the description of the novel particles , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ multiplett ] .",
    "[ multiplett ]    in the following time further particles giving need for new quark flavors were discovered . today",
    "six quark flavors are assumed : up , down , strange , charm , bottom and top .",
    "these quarks are stable concerning the strong interaction , so that the whole net number of quarks of each flavor is conserved .",
    "anti - quarks are counted with an opposite sign , so that the production of new particles via the production of quark - antiquark - pairs and rearrangement of the other quarks is possible .",
    "the conservation of the net quark numbers led to several conservation numbers like the strangeness content @xmath1 @xmath2 similarly , the charm quantum number describes the number of charm quarks etc .",
    "the net numbers of up and down quarks did not give rise to special conservation quantity since their conservation is implicitly assured by the conservation of the net baryon number and the charge .",
    "however , the quark numbers are not stable against the weak interaction .",
    "thus , a kaon may decay within about @xmath3s into lepton pairs or mesons , e.g. @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is , however , important for the experimental detection but will not touch our theoretical considerations .",
    "the interest of the kaon itself in a heavy ion collision is that during this short reaction time of about @xmath5s strangeness is rigidly conserved and a produced @xmath0 can effectively not be destroyed .",
    "thus , strangeness is a direct signal from a heavy ion reaction .",
    "this property has triggered for a long time a full spectrum of theoretical and experimental activities , whose exhaustive description would be quite impossible . for first ideas",
    "see for example @xcite    in this article the production of kaons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at energies close to the threshold of elementary production is studied .",
    "this energy domain corresponds to experiments performed at the sis accelerator at gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "this article focus on the positively charged @xmath0 which is better accessible by experiment .",
    "the @xmath6 is assumed to have similar properties .",
    "however , there is no unique relation to experiment , since the @xmath6 and its antiparticle , the @xmath7 , mix together into the short living @xmath8 and the long - living @xmath9 .",
    "the antikaons ( @xmath10 and @xmath7 ) are not discussed neither , although their production is strongly coupled to the kaon production .",
    "its exhaustive discussion would drastically enhance the size of this article .",
    "a special attention will be paid to the reaction au+au at 1.5 agev incident energy which has been recently investigated in detail by the kaos and fopi collaborations at gsi .",
    "the isospin quantum molecular dynamics model ( iqmd ) @xcite is a semi - classical model which describes heavy ion collisions on an event by event basis .",
    "only a brief sketch of the model will be given here .",
    "for a detailed description see @xcite . for microscopic models of heavy ion collisions in general",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for some review dedicated to strangeness production see @xcite .      in iqmd particles",
    "are represented by the 1 particle wigner density . @xmath11",
    "the total 1 particle wigner density is the sum of all nucleons .",
    "the expectation value of the total hamiltonian is @xmath12 the baryon - potential consists of the real part of the @xmath13-matrix which is supplemented by the coulomb interaction between the charged particles .",
    "the former can be further subdivided in a part containing the contact skyrme - type interaction only , a contribution due to a finite range yukawa - potential , and a momentum dependent part .",
    "@xmath14 in the description of the coulomb interaction @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the charges of the baryons @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the momentum dependence @xmath19 of the @xmath20@xmath20 interaction , which may optionally be used in qmd , is fitted to experimental data @xcite on the real part of the nucleon optical potential @xcite , which yields @xmath21 the asymmetry energy is taken into account by the term @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the isospin @xmath25 of the particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. 1/2 for protons and -1/2 for neutrons .    the potential part of the equation of state resulting from the convolution of the distribution functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 with the interactions @xmath28 ( local interactions including momentum dependence ) reads : @xmath29    the parameters @xmath30 are uniquely related to the corresponding values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 which serve as input .",
    "the standard values of these parameters can be found in table [ eostab ] .",
    ".parameter sets for the nuclear equation of state used in the qmd model [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for semi - central collisions the calculations with the kn potential is closer to the data , while it is the opposite case for peripheral collisions .",
    "however , the iqmd - fits for peripheral collisions are dominated by the extreme bins at @xmath33 while the other bins comply with even lower values .",
    "thus , the polar distribution in peripheral collisions seems not be described well neither with nor without potential .",
    "we shall therefore focus on the semi - central collisions and investigate the question , which effects are responsible for the anisotropy .",
    "[ au15-tim - ct0 ]    the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-tim - ct0 ] shows the polar distributions of kaons directly after their production ( initial , dashed lines ) and in the final state ( final , solid lines ) .",
    "we selected kaons which did not collide ( blue lines ) and kaons which collided frequently .",
    "the initial distributions are rather flat for both types of kaons . for kaons without collisions",
    "there is a slight forward - backward enhancement due to preselection effects .",
    "kaons have some more chance to come out in forward - backward direction without having a collision than at @xmath34 .",
    "these kaons show a stronger forward - backward enhancement in the final state .",
    "this enhancement can only be true due to the optical potential since the kaons did not undergo any collision .",
    "thus there is a visible effect of the potential to the anisotropy , which may explain the different fit parameters of the calculations with and without potential .",
    "the multicolliding kaons ( red lines ) show a higher total yield and thus a higher total contribution to the kaon distribution .",
    "furthermore they show a much stronger forward - backward peaking.we will explain this effect a few lines later .    the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-tim - ct0 ] shows snapshots of the actual polar kaon distribution at different time steps .",
    "we see that the total yield enhances to about @xmath35 fm / c without showing a very strong anisotropy . only after the production of all kaons at times @xmath36 fm / c the distribution is getting its strong anisotropy .",
    "this is the time when all kaons are already produced but still collide with the nuclear matter .",
    "[ au15-col - ct0 ]    fig .",
    "[ au15-col - ct0 ] addresses the question which effect provokes the strong anisotropy for the multicollisionner particles . on the left hand side",
    "we compare the ( normalized ) polar distributions of the kaons directly after their production ( blue dashed line ) , in the final state ( red full line ) and the distribution of the last collision partners of those particles ( black dotted line ) .",
    "we see that the latter have a very strong forward - backward peaking , even stronger than those of the kaons in the final state . the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-col - ct0 ] show the mean longitudinal momentum of the final kaons ( red full line ) , the kaons directly after their production ( blue dashed line ) and of the last collision partners ( black dotted line ) as a function of the final polar angle of the kaon .",
    "the mean @xmath37 of the final state ( red full line ) is easy to understand , since it is directly correlated to the polar angle by @xmath38 .",
    "the mean @xmath37 of the initial state after the production ( blue dashed line ) is zero .",
    "this means that there is no preselection from the production where the particle would go finally .",
    "thus , particles ending in forward direction may have been produced with any longitudinal momentum initially .",
    "the mean @xmath37 of the last collision partners ( black dotted line ) is nearly the same than the mean final @xmath37 .",
    "this supports the assumption that their longitudinal momentum is responsible for the final direction of the kaon .",
    "we see that the kaons have collided with a nuclear medium , which is very anisotropic in momentum space .",
    "the anisotropy is thus majorly due to the rescattering .",
    "the influence of rescattering may also be a key for explaining the dependence of the polar distribution on the centre - of mass momentum as depicted on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-ct - aa ] .",
    "we know that the contribution of kaons having undergone many collisions is higher for high energy kaons than for low energy kaons",
    ". therefore they might yield a slight enhancement of the anisotropy at high momenta .",
    "[ au15-ct - aa ]      let us shortly discuss the energy and system size dependence of polar distributions .",
    "the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-ct - aa ] shows polar distributions of @xmath39 collisions at different system sizes .",
    "we see an enhancement of the anisotropy for heavier systems .",
    "this can again be explained by rescattering . in heavier systems",
    "there is much more rescattering of the kaons .",
    "a similar argument holds for the energy dependence of the polar distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ au15-ct - e ] for c+c ( left ) and au+au ( right ) . at higher incident energies",
    "the nucleons show a stronger anisotropy especially for light systems . in the rescattering of the kaons they transfer some part of that anisotropy to the kaons .",
    "[ au15-ct - e ]      after the investigation of the polar angle distributions let us finally study the azimuthal angular distribution at mid - rapidity .",
    "@xmath40 is the angle between the transverse momentum @xmath41 and the x - axis , where the x - axis is the direction of the impact parameter between projectile and target .",
    "[ au15-phi - b ]    fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - b ] shows the azimuthal distribution of the kaons at mid - rapidity for a semi - peripheral centrality ( @xmath42fm , left hand side ) and for a peripheral centrality bin ( @xmath43 , right hand side ) .",
    "we see that calculations with an optical potential ( red full line ) yield less absolute yields than calculations without potential ( blue dashed line ) and that the distributions for semi - central events are much less pronounced than those of the peripheral events .",
    "the latter finding is also supported by experiment @xcite .",
    "we will thus concentrate on the peripheral events and analyze only normalized distributions to investigate the significance of the out - of plane enhancement .",
    "the strength of the effect is in agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "[ au15-phi - c ]    in order to understand the effect we analyze on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - c ] the influence of the experimental cuts .",
    "an analysis of all kaons without any constraints on the rapidity ( @xmath44 , blue dashed line ) already shows an out - of - plane peak .",
    "if we now reduce the rapidity window to the same size than the experiment ( black dotted line ) we enhance the peak since we go more to the mid - rapidity region .",
    "if we finally apply @xmath45 cuts ( red full line ) we enhance the peak still more since we cut out rather isotope low energy kaons .",
    "the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - c ] compares the distribution taking all experimental cuts but varying on the potentials and rescattering .",
    "if we forbid all potentials and rescattering ( sources , green dash - dotted line ) the distribution is quite flat .",
    "if we now allow rescattering but forbid the optical potential ( no pot , full resc .",
    ", blue dashed line ) we get an enhancement out - of - plane . if on the other hand we allow the optical potential but forbid the rescattering ( kn pot , no resc .",
    ", black dotted line ) the enhancement is stronger .",
    "but the maximum final enhancement can only be got by allowing potential and rescattering ( kn pot , full resc .",
    "red full line ) .",
    "[ au15-phi - t ]    let us now look on the time evolution of the kaon squeeze as it is shown on th left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - t ] .",
    "the curves are normalized , thus the effect of the increasing number of kaons is not visible .",
    "we see that the kaons are produced rather isotropically since up to about 8 fm / c there is a flat distribution which changes slightly at about 12 fm / c ( when the kaon production is majorly finished ) to obtain its final form at about 16 fm / c . at this time",
    "the collisions are still active .",
    "if we decompose the kaon distributions according to their number of collisions ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - t ] ) we find an effect of preselection .",
    "the initial curve of kaons that wo nt collide during the reaction ( green dash - dotted line ) shows already a weak peaking out - of plane , while the initial curve of kaons which will collide frequently ( black dotted line ) has its maximum in plane .",
    "this is due to the effect that the kaons have more chance to collide when passing upward or downward into the spectator matter while the chance to escape without collisions is higher when moving out of plane .",
    "the final distributions show both an out - of - plane peak where the peak of the particles which did not collide ( blue dashed line ) is stronger that that of the particles which collided frequently ( red full line ) .",
    "we see that the out - of - plane squeeze is due to rescattering and potential , where the potential seems to play the more important role .",
    "[ au15-phi - rho ]    let us now decompose the spectra according to the transverse momentum(left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - rho ] ) . for a better statistics all rapidities are taken , which causes a slight reduction of the squeeze signal ( see left hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - c ] ) .",
    "we see that the squeeze is stronger for particles with high transverse momenta .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental data @xcite who also noted this effect .",
    "we also decompose the squeeze according to the production density of the kaons ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - rho ] ) .",
    "kaons stemming from less high densities ( blue dashed line ) show a stronger signal than those stemming from high densities ( red full line ) .",
    "this is in analogy to what one finds for the nucleon squeeze @xcite .",
    "let us finally take a glance at the energy and system size dependence as shown in fig .",
    "[ au15-phi - a ] .",
    "we see a slight increase of the squeeze effect with increasing system size and a slight decrease of the squeeze with increasing incident energy .",
    "this effect is similar but stronger for the nucleon signal which also shows an increase with system size and an decrease with incident energy for energies higher than 400 mev .",
    "furthermore the kaon squeeze at energies of about 1 gev and below is dominated by the kn - potentials .",
    "calculations including kn potentials give similar resulats with and without kn rescattering .",
    "switching off the kn potentials reduces the kaon squeeze significantly when rescattering is allowed and yields a flat distribution without kn rescattering .",
    "this again gives some hint to the strong correlation of nucleonic matter to the dynamics of kaons .",
    "[ au15-phi - a ]",
    "we have analyzed the production of kaons in heavy ion collisions at incident energies below the elementary threshold .",
    "we see that the production of the kaons is rather collective phenomenon requiring high densities and multi - step processes .",
    "nevertheless the kaons do not take a unique signature of this high density zone since they rescatter afterward .",
    "the optical potential of the kaon in the nuclear medium influences strongly the absolute number of the kaon yield and the low energy part ob the kaon spectra .",
    "there is also a strong influence on the azimuthal distributions but only a weak influence on the polar distributions .",
    "the rescattering influences the high energy part of the spectra and the temperatures .",
    "there is a strong influence on the polar distributions but a less strong influence on the azimuthal distributions .",
    "the comparison of absolute kaon yield between experiment and calculations is still problematic due to the uncertainties relying in the parametrization of unknown cross sections .",
    "comparison of the spectra in p+a collisions nearby the threshold support rather the calculations with an optical potential .",
    "the use of ratios au / c allow to cancel at least the major parts of that uncertainties and support the assumptions of a soft nuclear equation of state .",
    "this equation of state is also supported by the analysis of the dependence of the kaon yield on the participant number .",
    "all in all we can conclude that the study of different observables on kaon production is a very helpful tool to view inside the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "iqmd is able to describe the kaon data reasonably well . in general the calculations using an optical potential and rescattering",
    "show the best agreement .",
    "this can be seen as a hint to the importance of medium effects for the kaon production close to the threshold .",
