    "experimental investigations of the rheology of concentrated suspensions often involve a vane - in - cup geometry ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the vane tool offers two main advantages over other geometries .",
    "first , it allows the study of the properties of structured materials with minimal disturbance of the material structure during the insertion of the tool [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is thus widely used to study the properties of gels and thixotropic materials [ @xcite ] and for in situ study of materials as e.g. in the context of soil mechanics [ @xcite ] .",
    "second , it is supposed to avoid wall slip [ @xcite ] , which is a critical feature in concentrated suspensions [ @xcite ] ; the reason for this belief is that the material sheared in the gap of the geometry is sheared by the ( same ) material that is trapped between the blades .",
    "consequently , it is widely used to study the behavior of pasty materials containing large particles , such as fresh concrete [ @xcite ] and foodstuff [ @xcite ] .",
    "the constitutive law of materials can be obtained from a rheological study with the vane - in - cup geometry provided one knows the coefficients  called `` geometry factors ''  that allow the conversion of the raw macroscopic data ( torque , rotational angle or velocity ) into local data ( shear stress , shear strain or shear rate ) .",
    "however , in contrast with other classical geometries , even the _ a priori _ simple linear problem ( for hookean or newtonian materials ) is complex to solve with a vane tool .",
    "this linear problem was studied theoretically by @xcite and @xcite in the general case of a @xmath2-bladed vane tool embedded in an infinite linear medium .",
    "the analytical expression found for the torque vs. rotational velocity is in rather good agreement with macroscopic experimental data [ @xcite ] .",
    "note however two possible shortcomings of this theoretical approach for its use in practice : the blades are infinitely thin and there is no external cylinder .",
    "there is no such approach in the case of nonlinear media ( _ i.e. _ complex fluids ) .",
    "a practical method used to study the flow properties of non - linear materials , known as the couette analogy [ @xcite ] , consists in calibrating the geometry factors with hookean or newtonian materials .",
    "one defines the equivalent inner radius @xmath3 of the vane - in - cup geometry as the radius of the inner cylinder of a couette geometry that would have the same geometry factors for a linear material . for any material , all macroscopic data",
    "are then analyzed as if the material was sheared in a couette geometry of inner cylinder radius @xmath3 .",
    "the nonlinearity ( that affects the flow field ) is sometimes accounted for as it is in a standard couette geometry [ @xcite ] .",
    "this approach may finally provide constitutive law measurements within a good approximation [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , simulations and observations show that @xmath3 is not a universal parameter of the vane tool independent of the properties of the studied material . while the streamlines go into the virtual cylinder delimited by the blades in the case of newtonian media [ @xcite ] , yielding an equivalent radius lower than the vane radius [ @xcite ] , it was found from simulations [ @xcite ] that the streamlines are nearly cylindrical everywhere for shear - thinning fluids if their index @xmath4 is of order 0.5 or less , and thus that @xmath5 in these cases .",
    "moreover , for yield stress fluids , simulations and photographs of the shearing zone around a four - bladed vane rotating in bingham fluids [ @xcite ] , simulations of herschel - bulkley and casson fluids flows in a four - bladed vane - in - cup geometry [ @xcite ] , and simulations of bingham fluids flows in a six - bladed vane - in - cup geometry [ @xcite ] , all show that at yield ( _ i.e. _ at low shear rates ) , the material contained in the virtual cylinder delimited by the blades rotates as a rigid body , and that it flows uniformly in a thin cylindrical layer near the blades .",
    "this is now widely accepted [ @xcite ] and used to perform a couette analogy with @xmath5 ; the yield stress @xmath6 is then simply extracted from torque @xmath7 measurements at low velocity thanks to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the vane tool height ( neglecting end effects ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the flow field in a vane - in - cup geometry and its consequences on the geometry factors have thus led to many studies .",
    "however , only theoretical calculations , macroscopic measurements and simulation data exist in the literature : there are no experimental local measurements of the flow properties of newtonian and non - newtonian materials induced by a vane tool except the qualitative visualization of streamlines made by @xcite for newtonian media , and the photographs of @xcite for yield stress fluids .",
    "moreover , while the main advantage of the vane tool is the postulated absence of wall slip , as far as we know , this widely accepted hypothesis has been neither investigated in depth nor criticized . in order to provide such local data ,",
    "we have performed velocity measurements during the flows of a newtonian medium and of a yield stress fluid in both a coaxial cylinder geometry and a vane - in - cup geometry .",
    "we have also performed particle concentration measurements in a concentrated suspension of noncolloidal particles in a yield stress fluid , which is a good model system for complex pastes such as fresh concrete [ @xcite ] .",
    "our main results are that :    1 .   in the newtonian",
    "fluid , the @xmath0-averaged strain rate component @xmath1 decreases as the inverse squared radius in the gap , as in a couette geometry , which allows direct determination ( without end - effect corrections ) of the value of @xmath3 : it is here found to be lower than @xmath10 , but slightly higher than for a vane in an infinite medium ; the flow enters deeply the region between the blades , leading to a significant extensional flow ; 2 .   in the yield stress",
    "fluid , in contrast with results from the literature , the layer of material that is sheared near the blades at low velocity does not have a cylindrical shape ; 3 .   in the suspension of noncolloidal particles in a yield stress fluid , the noncolloidal particles are quickly expelled from a thin zone near the blades , leading to the development of a thin slip layer made of the pure interstitial yield stress fluid , in sharp contradiction with the common belief that the vane tool prevents slippage .    in sec .",

    "[ section_results][section_suspension ] is devoted to the case of suspensions , with a focus on the slip layer created by a shear - induced migration phenomenon specific to the vane tool .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "all flows are supposed to be @xmath12 invariants ( _ i.e. _ there are no flow instabilities ) .",
    "we define the @xmath0-average @xmath13 of a function @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "we study three materials : a newtonian fluid , a yield stress fluid , and a concentrated suspension of noncolloidal particles in this yield stress fluid . + the newtonian fluid is a silicon oil of 20 mpa.s viscosity .",
    "+ the yield stress fluid is a concentrated water in oil emulsion .",
    "the continuous phase is dodecane oil in which span 80 emulsifier is dispersed at a 7% concentration .",
    "a 100  g / l cacl@xmath16 solution is then dispersed in the oil phase at 6000  rpm during 1 hour with a sliverson l4rt mixer .",
    "the droplets have a size of order 1  @xmath17 m from microscope observations .",
    "the droplet concentration is 75% , and the emulsion density is @xmath18  g@xmath19 .",
    "the emulsion behavior , measured through coupled rheological and mri techniques described in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_emulsion_behavior ] ) , is well fitted to a herschel - bulkley behavior @xmath20 with yield stress @xmath21  pa , consistency @xmath22=6.8  pas@xmath23 , and index @xmath24 . +    .",
    "the empty squares are local data ; the solid line is a herschel - bulkley fit to the data @xmath20 with @xmath21  pa , @xmath22=6.8  pas@xmath23 , and @xmath24.,width=302 ]     + the suspension is a suspension of monodisperse polystyrene beads ( density @xmath25  g@xmath19 , diameter @xmath26 m ) suspended at a 40@xmath27 volume fraction in the concentrated emulsion described above .",
    "the density matching between the particles and the yield stress fluid is sufficient to prevent shear - induced sedimentation of the particles in the yield stress fluid [ @xcite ] ; in all experiments , we check that the material remains homogeneous in the vertical direction by means of mri density measurements .",
    "the rheometric experiments are mainly performed within a six - bladed vane - in - cup geometry ( vane radius @xmath28  cm , outer cylinder radius @xmath29  cm , height @xmath3011  cm ) .",
    "the shaft radius is 1.1  cm and the blade thickness is 6  mm .",
    "other experiments are performed with a wide - gap couette geometry of slightly different inner cylinder radius @xmath31  cm , due to the presence of sandpaper ( the other dimensions were identical ) .",
    "the inner cylinder of the couette geometry , and the outer cylinder of both geometries are covered with sandpaper of roughness equivalent to the size of the largest elements of the materials studied in order to avoid wall slip .",
    "+ in the rheometric experiments presented here , we control the rotational velocity of the inner cylinder , with values ranging from 0.1 to 100  rpm .",
    "proton mri [ @xcite ] was chosen as a non - intrusive technique in order to get measurements of the local velocity and of the local bead concentration inside the sample .",
    "experiments are performed on a bruker 24/80 dbx spectrometer equipped with a 0.5 t vertical superconductive magnet with 40  cm bore diameter and operating at 21  mhz ( proton frequency ) .",
    "we perform our experiments with a home made nmr - compliant rheometer , equipped with the geometries described in the previous section .",
    "this device was already used in a number of previous rheo - nmr studies [ @xcite ] , and is fully described in @xcite .",
    "the volume imaged is a ( virtual ) rectangular portion of 4  cm in the axial ( vertical ) direction with a width ( in the tangential direction ) of 1  cm and a length of 7  cm ( in the radial direction , starting from the central axis ) .",
    "velocity and concentration profiles @xmath32 and @xmath33 , averaged over the vertical and tangential directions in this volume , are obtained with a resolution of 270  @xmath17 m in the radial direction .",
    "this volume is situated at the magnet center ( so as to minimize the effects of field heterogeneities ) and sufficiently far from the bottom and the free surface of the rheometer so that flow perturbations due to edge effects are negligible .",
    "we checked that the velocity and concentration profiles are homogeneous along the vertical direction in this volume , which justifies averaging data over this direction .",
    "details on the sequence used to obtain velocity profiles can be found in [ @xcite ] . while it is possible to get 2d or 3d maps of 2d or 3d velocity vectors [ @xcite ] , such measurements may actually take minutes and require complex synchronization of the mri sequences and of the geometry position",
    ". however , we will show in the following that the azimuthal velocity alone provides a valuable information that can be sufficient for most analyses ; in particular it allows computation of the @xmath0-averaged strain rate component @xmath34 and thus the @xmath0-averaged shear stress @xmath35 ( and the torque @xmath7 ) in the case of the newtonian oil .",
    "that is why we have chosen to limit ourselves to 1d profiles of 1d velocity measurements , namely the azimuthal velocity @xmath36 as a function of the radius @xmath37 and time @xmath38 , for which a single measurement may take as little as 1  s ; this has allowed us to perform a sufficient number of experiments , with various materials , geometries , and rotational velocities .",
    "depending on the time over which this measurement is averaged as compared to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of blades and @xmath41 is the rotational velocity , this measurement may provide either a time ( or @xmath42)-averaged azimuthal velocity @xmath43 or an instantaneous ( transient ) azimuthal velocity @xmath36 . in this latter case , the @xmath42 dependence of the azimuthal velocity @xmath44 at a given radius @xmath37 can then be easily reconstructed by simply replacing the time @xmath38 dependence by an angular @xmath42 dependence with @xmath45 .",
    "it should also be noted that due to incompressibility of the materials we study , the @xmath46 field can be reconstructed thanks to @xmath47 with @xmath48 ; however , this derivation from the experimentally measured values of @xmath44 can not be very accurate . finally , from @xmath46 and @xmath44 , we are also able to evaluate the strain rate components @xmath49 and @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "note that the derivative @xmath51 with respect to coordinate @xmath52 of experimental data @xmath53 measured at regularly spaced positions @xmath54 was computed as : @xmath55/[x_{i+1}-x_{i-1}]$ ] .",
    "the nmr sequence used in this work to measure the local bead concentration is a modified version of the sequence aiming at measuring velocity profiles along one diameter in couette geometry [ @xcite ] , and is described in full detail in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that during measurements , only nmr signal originating from those hydrogen nuclei belonging to the liquid phase of the sample ( _ i.e. _ both the oil and water phase of the emulsions ) is recorded : the local nmr signal that is measured is thus proportional to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the local particle volume fraction .",
    "a rather low absolute uncertainty of @xmath58 on the concentration measurements values was estimated in @xcite .",
    "all volume fraction profiles are measured at rest , after a given flow history .",
    "this is possible because the particles do not settle in the yield stress fluid at rest : the volume fraction profile induced by shear is gelled by the interstitial yield stress fluid .",
    "in this section , we study successively the flow properties of the newtonian oil , the yield stress fluid , and the suspension .      in this section ,",
    "we study the flows observed with a newtonian fluid .",
    "we first present a basic theoretical analysis of the flows in a vane - in - cup geometry as compared to flows in a standard couette geometry , which provides the basis for a couette analogy .",
    "the @xmath42-averaged azimuthal profiles @xmath59 are then shown , and are compared to predictions of the couette analogy . the full velocity field @xmath60 , @xmath46 is finally presented and analyzed .",
    "the stress balance equation projected along the azimuthal axis is : ( 1/r)_r(r^2)+_()-_p=0 [ equation_balance]where @xmath61 is the deviatoric stress tensor and @xmath62 the pressure .",
    "the strain rate tensor component @xmath1 is given by : ( r,)=((1/r)_(v_r)+r_r ( v_/r))[equation_strain_rate ]    we recall that the constitutive law of a newtonian fluid of viscosity @xmath63 is : = 2[equation_newtonian ] .",
    "in all the following analysis , we assume a no - slip boundary condition at the walls of the inner tool and of the cup .      in a standard  coaxial cylinders  couette geometry , due to cylindrical symmetry , eq .",
    "[ equation_balance ] becomes @xmath64 which means that the whole shear stress distribution @xmath65 in the gap is known whatever the constitutive law of the material is .",

    "there is _ a priori _ no cylindrical symmetry and all quantities _ a priori _",
    "depend on @xmath0 .",
    "however , averaging eq .",
    "[ equation_balance ] over @xmath42 yields @xmath73 .",

    "the link between this stress distribution and the torque @xmath66 exerted on the vane tool may then seem difficult to build .",

    "this means that @xmath84 and @xmath59 follow the same scaling with @xmath37 and @xmath41 as in the standard couette geometry , but with a different prefactor .",
    "nevertheless , these equations provide a new insight in the couette analogy .",

    "[ equation_velocity_vane ]  and  [ equation_velocity_couette ] , we see that from the local flow perspective , there is a couette analogy in the sense that the @xmath0-averaged azimuthal velocity ( and shear ) profiles will be exactly the same as in a couette geometry .",
    "this defines a radius @xmath3 of the equivalent couette geometry , such that @xmath59 and @xmath84 for @xmath78 are given by : ( r)=[equation_velocity_vane_eq ] +    @xmath3 are equivalent : combining eqs .",

    "this will be illustrated in the following .",
    "the only theoretical prediction of the stress field associated with a vane tool is that of @xcite for an infinite @xmath2-bladed vane embedded in an infinite linear medium . in this case",
    ", it is shown that the torque @xmath88 exerted on the vane is well approximated by = 1-[equation_prediction_atkinson ] where @xmath89 is the torque exerted on a cylinder of same radius @xmath10 as the vane in an infinite medium ( _ i.e. _ with @xmath90 ) .",
    "[ equation_prediction_atkinson ] is in agreement with experimental results [ @xcite ] .",

    "however , when the cup to vane radius ratio @xmath93 is not large , no generic theoretical expression exists in the literature .    nevertheless , bounds of the value of the torque @xmath94 can be derived using classical results of linear elasticity  [ @xcite ] .",
    "our starting points are the variational approaches to the solution of the stokes equations describing the flow of an incompressible linear material induced by the rotation of an inner tool ( of any shape ) at a rotational velocity @xmath41 within a cup . in this framework",

    "we now see that while the depletion phenomenon seems symmetric around both sides of the blades at a macroscopic scale , it is clearly asymmetric at a local scale near the blades and depends on the direction of rotation : depletion is more pronounced at the back of the blade ( note that the vane tool rotates counterclockwise ) .",
    "this would mean that the noncolloidal particle trajectories are asymmetric around the blade : a particle that is found at a radius @xmath189  cm just before the blade is necessarily found at a radius slightly higher than 4.02  cm after the blade as there are no particles at @xmath186  cm .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of the fore - aft asymmetry that is observed in the bulk of noncolloidal suspensions [ @xcite ] and that leads to their non - newtonian properties [ @xcite ] .",
    "it thus seems that , in addition to the shear - induced migration mechanism intrinsic to suspensions , the vane tool induces a specific migration mechanism which has its origin in the direct interactions between the particles and the blades ; this effects leads to the full depletion that is observed at the transition between the sheared and the unsheared material .",
    "such direct effect of a flow geometry on migration has also been observed in microchannel flows of colloidal suspensions [ @xcite ] , and also led to full particle depletion .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of the phenomenon will be briefly discussed below .",
    "the rest of the volume fraction profile results from a complex interplay between shear - induced migration and the fore - aft asymmetry around the blades ; this leads to the rapid increase of the volume fraction between 3.1  cm and 4.02  cm .",
    "after 4.02  cm the flow lines do not meet the blade edges , and the phenomenon evidenced above should have basically no effect on the heterogeneity that develops in the gap of the geometry . on the other hand",
    ", the mean volume fraction should be slightly higher due to mass conservation ; it is indeed observed to be equal to around 42% .",
    "nevertheless , as the mean radial shear rate heterogeneity is basically similar to that observed in a standard couette geometry ( see previous sections ) , we would _ a priori _ expect the heterogeneity to be somehow similar .",
    "however , we observe that the volume fraction profile is only slightly heterogeneous : there is less than 5% variation of the volume fraction in the gap , to be compared to the 15% variation observed in the couette geometry .",
    "clearly , this means that the couette analogy is irrelevant as regards this phenomenon , and that the details of shear matter . here ,",
    "the extensional flow that adds to shear may be at the origin of this diminution of migration .",
    "a more detailed analysis is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "let us now study the behavior at low shear rate .",
    "low shear rates are typically imposed with the aim of measuring the yield stress of such materials .",
    "starting from a homogeneous suspension at rest , we apply a rotational velocity @xmath175  rpm ( without any preshear ) , and we measure the evolution of the particle volume fraction in time .",
    "the corresponding volume fraction profiles are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_concentration_profile_omega1 ] .",
    "rpm measured in the vane - in - cup geometry after different times of shear : 5min , 1h , 14h . the material is homogeneous at the beginning of shear .",
    "the inset presents the @xmath0-averaged azimuthal velocity profile @xmath59 measured in the first stages of shear ; the dotted line is the theoretical rigid motion induced by the rotation of the vane tool ; the vertical dashed line shows the radius of the vane.,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_concentration_profile_omega1 ] , we observe that , although shear is much less important than in the previous experiments , particle depletion also appears between the blades .",
    "comparison of the velocity profile and the volume fraction profile shows that depletion also appears between the blades at the transition zone between the sheared and the unsheared materials .",
    "this phenomenon appears with a very fast kinetics : the lower volume fraction value in the measurement zone is 36% after only a 5 minute shear ( corresponding to a macroscopic strain of order 50 ) .",
    "afterwards , it continues evolving slowly : the minimum observed volume fraction is of order 33% after a 1h shear and of order 32% after a 14h shear ( corresponding to a 10000 macroscopic strain ) .",
    "note that the radial position of the minimum value of the volume fraction slightly decreases in time ; it likely corresponds to progressive erosion of the material between the blades ( we did not measure the velocity profiles to check this hypothesis ) .",
    "we also note that migration is negligible in the rest of the sheared material as expected from the theory of migration briefly described above ( a larger strain would be needed to observe significant migration ) . nevertheless , we note some particle accumulation ( with a volume fraction value of 43% ) at @xmath169=4.7  cm after a very long time .",
    "this corresponds to the yield surface as flow is localized at low velocity ( see velocity profile fig .",
    "[ fig_concentration_profile_omega1 ] ) .",
    "migration profiles usually result from an equilibrium between various sources of fluxes . on the other hand",
    ", the unsheared material does not produce any particle flux while it receives particles from the sheared region .",
    "this particle accumulation is thus the signature that the migration phenomenon is indeed active , although not observable on the profile measured in the sheared zone .",
    "it is probable that this accumulation process would stop only ( after a very long time ) when there are no more particles in the sheared region .",
    "( b ) is a zoom of image ( a ) between two adjacent blades .",
    "the image is taken in the horizontal plane of the geometry , at middle height of the vane tool , and corresponds to a vertical average over 2  cm .",
    "the vane tool rotates counterclockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=298 ] + ( a)(b )    as above , 2d magnetic resonance images of the material provide an insight in the phenomenon . in fig .",
    "[ fig_image_vane_omega1 ] , we observe again that particle depletion is enhanced at the rear of the blades ; this confirms that this phenomenon is likely due to direct interactions between the blades and the particles , leading to the asymmetry of the particles trajectory around the blades .",
    "this _ a priori _ occurs with any particle whose trajectory is close to the blades , explaining why particle depletion appears so rapidly .",
    "there is probably no way to avoid it .",
    "note that the images are here much brighter very close to the blades than midway between two adjacent blades ; this would mean that the particle volume fraction is probably close to @xmath190 near the blades , although we observe volume fraction of order 32% between two blades .",
    "+ finally , let us note that the bright line provides a good idea of the boundary between the sheared material and the material that moves as a rigid body .",
    "we see as in sec .",
    "[ section_results][section_emulsion ] that this is far from being cylindrical even at this low velocity .",
    "we finally present some consequences of this phenomenon . from the above observations ,",
    "our conclusion is that depletion sets up quickly and is probably unavoidable .",
    "then two situations have to be distinguished .",
    "if linear viscoelastic properties of a suspension of large particles are measured at rest on the homogeneous material in its solid regime , without any preshear , then these measurements pose no other problem than that of the relevant couette analogy to be used ( see sec .  [ section_results][section_oil ] ) .",
    "if a yield stress measurement is performed at low imposed rotational velocity , starting from the homogeneous material at rest , then this measurement is likely valid as long as only the peak value or the plateau value at low strain ( of order 1 ) is recorded . on the other hand , any subsequent analysis of the material behavior will _ a priori _ be misleading : irreversible changes have occurred and the material can not be studied anymore . more generally , any measurement performed after a preshear will be incorrect and any flow curve measurement will lead to wrong evaluation of the material properties . in these last cases , the consequence of the new particle depletion phenomenon we have evidenced is a kind of wall slip near the blades , whereas there are no walls . here",
    "the `` slip layer '' is made of the ( pure ) interstitial yield stress fluid in a zone close to the blades , as would be observed near a smooth inner cylinder .",
    "this contrasts with the common belief that the vane tool prevents slippage .    in order to illustrate this feature , we present some results of @xcite : mahaut _ et al .",
    "_ performed classical upward / downward shear rate sweeps with a six - bladed vane - in - cup geometry ( @xmath191  cm , @xmath192  cm , @xmath304.5  cm , blade thickness=0.8  mm ) in a pure concentrated emulsion , and in the same emulsion filled with 20% of 140  @xmath17 m ps beads . in these experiments ,",
    "constant macroscopic shear rates steps increasing from 0.01 to 10  s@xmath167 and then decreasing from 10 to 0.01  s@xmath167 were applied during 30s , and the stationary shear stress was measured for each shear rate value .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sweep_suspension ] .",
    "m ps beads ( filled / open circles ) . figure from @xcite.,width=302 ]    while the same curve is observed for the upward / downward shear rate sweeps in the case of the pure emulsion ( as expected for a simple non - thixotropic yield stress fluid ) , the shear stress during the upward shear rate sweep differs from the shear stress during the downward shear rate sweep in the case of the suspension .",
    "moreover , any measurement performed on the suspension after this experiment gives a static yield stress equal to the dynamic yield stress observed during the downward sweep .",
    "this means that there has been some irreversible change .",
    "this irreversible change is actually the particle depletion near the blades we have observed in this paper . as the flow of the suspension is localized near the inner tool at low shear rate , it means that after the first upward sweep that has induced the particle depletion , during the downward shear rate sweep only the pure emulsion created by migration near the blades remains in the sheared layer at sufficiently low rotational velocity .",
    "this explains why the same apparent value of the yield stress is found in the suspension during the downward sweep as in the pure emulsion with this experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the yield stress at the beginning of the very first upward sweep is that of the suspension as migration has not occurred yet .",
    "the conclusion is that the vane tool is probably not suitable to the study of flows of suspensions of large particles .",
    "as a conclusion , let us summarize our main findings :    * in the case of newtonian fluid flows , our measurements support the couette equivalence approach : the @xmath0-averaged strain rate component @xmath1 decreases as the inverse squared radius in the gap .",
    "interestingly , the velocity profiles allow determining the couette equivalent radius without end - effect correction and independently of the viscosity of the material . the torque exerted by the vane in our display",
    "is found to be higher ( by 8% ) than the theoretical prediction of @xcite for a vane embedded in an infinite medium , and is thus much closer to the torque exerted by a couette geometry of same radius as the vane than expected from the literature .",
    "a key observation may be that there is a significant flow between the blades which adds an important extensional component to shear , thus increasing dissipation . from a short review of the literature",
    ", it clearly appears that numerical investigations are still needed in the case of finite geometries .",
    "variational approaches are also promising , although they do not yet provide tight bounds .",
    "* in the case of yield stress fluid flows , we find that the thin layer of material which flows around the vane tool at low velocity is not cylindrical , in contrast with what is usually supposed in the literature from simulation results .",
    "consequently , a non negligible extensional component of shear has probably to be taken into account in the analysis . at this stage , there are too few experimental and simulation data to understand the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "it thus seems that progress still has to be made , in particular through simulations , which allow a wide range of parameters to be studied .",
    "this may help understanding how the torque is linked to the yield stress of a material at low velocity , depending in particular on the geometry . *",
    "an important and surprising result is the observation of particle depletion near the blades when the yield stress fluid contains noncolloidal particles .",
    "this phenomenon is thus likely to occur when studying polydisperse pastes like coal slurries , mortars and fresh concrete .",
    "it has to be noted that the phenomenon is very rapid , irreversible , and thus probably unavoidable when studying flows of suspensions of large particles .",
    "it results in the creation of a pure interstitial yield stress fluid layer and thus in a kind of wall slip near the blades .",
    "it contrasts with the classical assumption that is made in the field of concentrated suspension rheology where the vane tool is mainly used to avoid this phenomenon .",
    "consequently , we would say that , in the case of pasty materials with large particles , if accurate measurements are needed , the vane tool may finally be suitable only for the study of the solid ( elastic ) properties of materials and for the static yield stress measurements ; as the yield stress measurement may induce irreversible particle depletion near the blades , any new measurement then requires a new sample preparation .",
    "furthermore , the vane can be used as a very accurate tool without any hypothesis nor any calibration to measure the relative increase of the elastic modulus of materials as a function of their composition [ @xcite ] . in order to study accurately the flows of pasty materials with large particles",
    ", our results suggest that a coaxial cylinders geometry with properly roughened surfaces is preferable when possible",
