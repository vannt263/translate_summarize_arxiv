    "transportation processes are common in complex natural and engineering systems , examples of which include transmission of data packets on the internet , public transportation systems , migration of carbon in biosystems , and virus propagation in social and ecosystems . in the past decade , transportation dynamics have been studied extensively in the framework of complex networks @xcite , where a phenomenon of main interest is the transition from free flow to traffic congestion .",
    "for example , it is of both basic and practical interest to understand the effect of network structure and routing protocols on the emergence of congestion @xcite . despite these works ,",
    "relatively little attention has been paid to the role of _ individual mobility_. the purpose of this paper is to address how this mobility affects the emergence of congestion in transportation dynamics .",
    "the issue of individual mobility has become increasingly fundamental due to the widespread use of ad - hoc wireless communication networks .",
    "the issue is also important in other contexts such as the emergence of cooperation among individuals @xcite and species coexistence in cyclic competing games @xcite .",
    "recently , some empirical data of human movements have been collected and analyzed @xcite . from the standpoint of complex networks ,",
    "when individuals ( nodes , agents ) are mobile , the edges in the network are no longer fixed , requiring different strategies to investigate the dynamics on such networks than those for networks with fixed topology . in this paper , we shall introduce an intuitive but physically reasonable model to deal with transportation dynamics on such mobile / non - stationary networks .",
    "in particular , we assume in our model that communication between two agents is possible only when their geographical distance is less than a pre - defined value , such as the case in wireless communication .",
    "information packets are transmitted from their sources to destinations through this scheme . to be concrete , we assume the physical region of interest is a square in the plane , and we focus on how the communication radius and moving speed may affect the transportation dynamics in terms of the emergence of congestion .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "firstly , we find that congestion can occur for small communication range , limited forwarding capability and low mobile velocity of agents .",
    "secondly , the transportation throughput exhibits a hierarchical structure with respect to the moving speed and there is in fact an algebraic power law between the throughput and the communication radius , where the power exponent tends to assume a smaller value for higher moving speed . to explain these phenomena in a quantitative manner",
    ", we develop a physical theory based on solutions to the fokker - planck equation under initial and boundary conditions that are specifically suited with the transportation dynamics on mobile - agent networks .",
    "besides providing insights into issues in complex dynamical systems such as contact process , random - walk theory , and self - organized dynamics , our results will have direct applications in systems of tremendous importance such as ad - hoc communication networks @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe our model of mobile agents in terms of the transportation rule and the network structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we present numerical results on the order parameter , the critical transition point and the average hopping time . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , a physical theory is presented to explain the numerical results .",
    "a brief conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in our model , @xmath0 agents move on a square - shaped cell of size @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "agents change their directions of motion @xmath2 as time evolves , but the moving speed @xmath3 is the same for all agents .",
    "initially , agents are randomly distributed on the cell . after each time step",
    ", the position and moving direction of an arbitrary agent @xmath4 are updated according to @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the coordinates of the agent at time @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is an @xmath0-independent random variable uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "each agent has the same communication radius @xmath13 .",
    "two agents can communicate with each other if the distance between them is less than @xmath13 . at each time step , there are @xmath14 packets generated in the system , with randomly chosen source and destination agents , and each agent can deliver at most @xmath15 packet ( we set @xmath16 in this paper ) toward its destination . to transport a packet , an agent performs a local search within a circle of radius @xmath13 .",
    "if the packet s destination is found within the searched area , it will be delivered directly to the destination and the packet will be removed immediately .",
    "otherwise , the packet is forwarded to a randomly chosen agent in the searched area .",
    "the queue length of each agent is assumed to be unlimited and the first - in - first - out principle holds for the queue . the transportation process is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeic ] .    the communication network among the mobile agents can be extracted as follows .",
    "every agent is regarded as a node of the network and a wireless link is established between two agents if their geographical distance is less than the communication radius @xmath13 . due to the movement of agents ,",
    "the network s structure evolves from time to time .",
    "the network evolution as a result of local mobility of agents is analogous to a locally rewiring process . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeic ] , nodes 1 and 2 are disconnected while node 3 and node 4 are connected at time @xmath10 . at time",
    "@xmath17 , nodes 1 and 2 depart from each other and become disconnected while nodes 3 and 4 approach each other and establish a communication link .",
    "note that the mobile process does not hold the same number of links at different time , which is different from the standard rewiring process where the number of links is usually fixed .",
    "we define an agent s degree at a specific time step as the number of links at that moment .",
    "figure  [ fig : degree ] shows that the degree distribution of networks of mobile agents exhibits the poisson distribution : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the degree , @xmath20 is the proportion of nodes with degree @xmath19 and @xmath21 is the average degree of network . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : degree ] , the average degree @xmath22 increases as the communication radius @xmath13 increases and the peak value of @xmath20 decreases as @xmath13 increases .",
    "we also investigate the relative size of the largest connected component and the clustering properties of the network in terms of the clustering coefficient .",
    "the relative size @xmath23 of the largest connected component is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath0 is the size of the largest connected component and the total network respectively .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath26 for node @xmath4 is defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath27 among the @xmath28 neighbors of node @xmath4 and its maximum possible value , @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 the average clustering coefficient @xmath31 is the average of @xmath26 over all nodes in the network . the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig : degree ] shows that @xmath23 and @xmath31 increase as the communication radius @xmath13 increases . in particular , when the value of @xmath13 exceeds a certain value .",
    "e.g. , @xmath32 , high values of @xmath23 and @xmath31 is attained .",
    "we also note that the motion speed does not influence the statistical properties of the communication network . in general",
    ", the communication network caused by limited searching area and mobile behavior is of geographically local connections associated with poisson distribution of node degrees and dense clustering structures .",
    "to characterize the throughput of a network , we exploit the order parameter @xmath33 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 indicates the average over a time window of width @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represents the total number of data packets in the whole network at time @xmath10 . as the packet - generation rate @xmath14 is increased through a critical value of @xmath39 , a transition occurs from free flow to congestion . for @xmath40 , due to the absence of congestion , there is a balance between the number of generated and that of removed packets so that @xmath41 , leading to @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath43 , congestion occurs and packets will accumulate at some agents , resulting in a positive value of @xmath44 .",
    "the traffic throughput of the system can thus be characterized by the critical value @xmath45 which is on average the largest number of generated packets that can be handled at each time without congestion .",
    "figure  [ fig : order](a ) exemplifies the transition in the order parameter @xmath44 from free flow to congestion state at some critical value @xmath45 .",
    "we find that @xmath45 depends on both the moving speed @xmath3 and the communication radius @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : order](b ) shows the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath3 for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "we observe a hierarchical structure in the dependence .",
    "specifically , when @xmath3 is less or larger than some values , @xmath45 remains unchanged at a low and a high value , respectively , regardless of the values of @xmath3 .",
    "the transition between these two values of @xmath45 is continuous .",
    "the hierarchical structure can in fact be predicted theoretically in a quantitative manner ( to be described ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rct](a ) shows the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath13 for different values of @xmath3 , which indicates an algebraic power law : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the power - law exponent .",
    "we find that the power law holds for a wide range of @xmath13 and the exponent @xmath47 is inversely correlated with @xmath3 . for example , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 but for large values of @xmath3 , say @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 . when @xmath13 reaches the size of the square cell , @xmath45 is close to @xmath0 as every agent always stays in the searching range of all others and almost all packets can arrive at their destinations in a single time step .    to gain additional insights into the dependence of @xmath45 on the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath3 so as to facilitate the development of a physical theory , we explore an alternative quantity , the average hopping time @xmath52 in the free flow state which , for a data packet , is defined as the number of hops from its source to destination .",
    "as we will see , @xmath52 can not only be calculated numerically , it is also amenable to theoretical analysis , providing key insights into the theory for @xmath45 .",
    "representative numerical results for @xmath52 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rct](b ) .",
    "we see that for large @xmath3 , @xmath53 scales with @xmath13 as @xmath54 and , as both @xmath3 and @xmath13 are increased , @xmath55 decreases .",
    "we now present a physical theory to explain the power law behaviors associated with @xmath52 and then @xmath45 .",
    "a starting point is to examine the limiting case of @xmath56 , where @xmath52 can be estimated analytically . in particular , assume that a particle walks randomly on an infinite plane .",
    "there are many holes of radius @xmath13 on the plane .",
    "holes form a phalanx and the distance between two nearby holes is @xmath1 .",
    "the particle will stop walking when it falls in a hole .",

    "is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "since the @xmath74 term is dominant , we have @xmath75 which gives the average hopping time as @xmath76 since @xmath77 the infinite - plane problem can be transformed into a problem on torus : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the first - kind and the second - kind bessel function , respectively , and @xmath83 .",

    "finally , we obtain @xmath52 as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , @xmath58 becomes zero in the area where a hole moves and @xmath95 decays with time under two mechanisms : diffusion at rate @xmath96 and motion of holes at the rate @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the weighting factor ( @xmath100 ) that decreases as @xmath3 increases .",

    ", agents are approximately well - mixed so that we can intuitively expect the average time @xmath52 to be determined by the inverse of the ratio of the agent s searching area and the area of the cell : @xmath108 the validity of this equation is supported by the fact that the ratio of the two areas is equivalent to the ratio of the total number of agents to the number of agents within the searching area .",
    "the estimation of @xmath52 for large @xmath3 is consistent with the theoretical prediction from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda])(iii ) by inserting @xmath102 .",

    "( [ 4.9 ] ) and ( [ eq : v3 ] ) for @xmath109 , we can derive a power law for @xmath45 . in a free - flow state ,",
    "the number of disposed packets is the same as that of generated packets @xmath110 in a time interval @xmath10 . for @xmath56 , the number of packets @xmath111 passing through an agent",
    "is proportional to its degree .",
    "this yields @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the degree of @xmath4 , the sum runs over all agents in the network , and @xmath114 is the average degree of the network . during @xmath10 steps , an agent can deliver at most @xmath115 packets . to avoid congestion",
    "requires @xmath116 .",
    "if all agents have the same delivering capacity @xmath15 , the transportation dynamics is dominated by the agent with the largest number of neighbors and the transition point @xmath39 can be estimated by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the largest degree of the network .",
    "thus , for @xmath48 , we have @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "since the degree distribution follows the poisson distribution : @xmath121 , the quantity @xmath118 can thus be estimated by @xmath122 inserting @xmath55 , @xmath114 and @xmath118 into eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath45 for low moving speed @xmath3 .    for large @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can also be applied but @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "hence , @xmath39 for large @xmath3 is given by @xmath125 equation ( [ 10 ] ) indicates that @xmath39 scales with @xmath126 , which is in good agreement with simulation results shown in fig .",

    "in conclusion , we have introduced a physical model to study the transportation dynamics on networks of mobile agents , where communication among agents is confined in a circular area of radius @xmath13 and agents move with fix speed @xmath3 but in random directions . in general , the critical packet - generating rate @xmath45 at which a transition in the transportation dynamics from free flow to congestion occurs depends on both @xmath13 and @xmath3 , and we have provided a theory to explain the dependence . our results yield physical insights into critical technological systems such as ad - hoc wireless communication networks .",
