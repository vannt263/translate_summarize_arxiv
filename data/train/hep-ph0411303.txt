    "in order to perform a meaningful search of extra - atmospheric neutrinos , the atmospheric neutrino background is needed to be known under various possible approximations @xcite .",
    "the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos is of special interest since a positive search shall not only yield the useful information from the surrounding cosmos but shall also corroborate the neutrino flavor mixing hypothesis @xcite .    in view of the presently available restricted ranges of the various neutrino mixing parameters in the three neutrino flavor approximation @xcite , as well as the recent relevant detector developments @xcite , it is of some interest to estimate the resulting new atmospheric tau flux .",
    "such studies may also provide some examples of new windows to study the cosmos around us , that shall open up under the hypothesis of the neutrino oscillations .",
    "previously , there is no attempt to estimate the atmospheric tau neutrino flux in the context of three neutrino flavor oscillations framework .",

    "recently , it is pointed out that the tau neutrino astronomy in the multi - gev energy range is possible , at least in principle .",
    "it is so , because the atmospheric @xmath2 flux is generally suppressed compared to the atmospheric @xmath3 flux , as a result the prospective observation of astronomical @xmath2 suffers much less background than in the @xmath3 case .",
    "the zenith angle ( @xmath4 ) dependence of the atmospheric background tau neutrino flux is also crucial in determining the possible future prospects @xcite .",
    "this is an example of the availability of a new cosmic horizon because of the neutrino oscillations , and is true for tau neutrinos only among the three neutrino flavors .",
    "it is also pointed out that for @xmath5 , the downward going atmospheric tau neutrino flux is minimum , thus providing an opportunity to search for extra - atmospheric tau neutrinos in this zenith angle range , in the presence of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation effects are minimal for the down ward going atmospheric neutrinos . as a result ,",
    "the oscillated atmospheric tau neutrino flux provides a minimal background for prospective astronomical tau neutrino flux searches .",
    "collectively , in these papers it is pointed out that contrary to general expectations , the atmospheric neutrino flux does not smear out the astronomical neutrino flux on the earth at low energy ( @xmath6 gev ) once the flavor composition of the incoming neutrino flux is taken into account .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the atmospheric tau neutrino flux in three neutrino flavor mixing approximation .",
    "this is an extension of the above mentioned previous works in this direction . as an implication of this estimate",
    ", we compare it with galactic - plane tau neutrino flux in the presence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is pointed out that the dominance of galactic plane tau neutrino flux over the downward atmospheric tau neutrino flux still persists in the multi - gev energy range .",
