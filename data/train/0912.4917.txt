    "the study of the quantum - electrodynamic processes involving photons and electrons in strong external electromagnetic fields is still topical from both an experimental and theoretical point of view , despite an extensive literature on this subject .",
    "the first relativistic theory of the processes of synchrotron radiation and pair production in a magnetic field was investigated in the works @xcite-@xcite in the approximation of ultrarelativistic motion of particles .",
    "the results of these works are included in the monographs of sokolov and ternov @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the operator method for solving this problem was applied by baier and katkov in the quasiclassic ultrarelativistic case @xcite .",
    "recently , there has appeared the work of these authors @xcite , where the operator method was used to study the process of electron - positron pair production by a photon , when the particles are located at low - energy landau levels . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , synchrotron radiation of electron - positron plasmas has been studied and landau level splitting due to interaction with photon field is taken into account . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of electron spins on radiation probability for the first 500 levels has been considered .",
    "reference @xcite is devoted to the studying of radiative width of cyclotron line and level splitting due to interaction with qed - vacuum .",
    "we also mention refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , where the processes of photon radiation and pair production was considered for the case of polarized particles .",
    "it should be noted that correlations between spin and polarization effects in these processes have not been studied in detail yet .",
    "the purpose of this paper is theoretical research of spin and polarization effects and their correlation in the processes of synchrotron radiation and pair production by a photon in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we use general expressions for probability of the processes when spin projections of the particles and photon polarization are arbitrary . in this paper",
    "the stokes parameters are used to define photon polarization .",
    "expressions for the probabilities are analyzed in the ultraquantum ( lowest landau levels ) and the ultrarelativistic approximations that are most important for experimental applications . in these approximations , simple analytical expressions depending on both particles spins and",
    "photon polarization were obtained .",
    "thus , it turned out to be possible to carry out analysis of spin and polarization effects and correlations between them .",
    "carrying out of corresponding experiments implies usage of magnetic fields that are comparable with the critical schwinger one @xmath0  g and are not feasible in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "the greatest constant field obtained is about @xmath1  t @xcite and the greatest pulse field is @xmath2  g @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out the possibility to obtain a strong magnetic field on qed length of about @xmath3  cm @xcite . in heavy ion collisions",
    "@xcite ( darmstadt , gsi ) coulomb fields compensate and the magnetic field can reach a strength of @xmath4  g in the region between ions if the impact parameter is about @xmath3  cm . in principle , qed processes can be observed in this region .",

    "particularly , cyclotron lines have been found in the radiation of x - ray pulsars .",
    "these lines correspond to the cyclotron radiation ( absorption ) of electrons that occupy the lowest landau levels .",
    "a lot of works are devoted to the investigation of these lines @xcite-@xcite . references @xcite-@xcite considering the pair production process and its applications to the pulsars are worth mentioning too .",
    "it should be noted that the astrophysical modeling of pulsars implies that radiation is emitted by unpolarized particles .",
    "however , electron - positron plasma in the magnetosphere of a pulsar is mostly created by the pair production process .",
    "consequently , electron spins in landau levels are not equally populated . in section [ app ]",
    "we compare transition rates for the cases of polarized and unpolarized particles .",
    "in a uniform , homogenous magnetic field @xmath5 energy levels of electrons are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the principal quantum number ( @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 is the momentum component parallel to the field ( we will use natural units , where @xmath10 throughout ) . in each landau state , the electron may have spin - up ( @xmath11 ) or spin - down ( @xmath12 ) along the field direction , except in the ground state , where only the spin - down state is allowed .",
    "the procedure of obtaining the probabilities of first - order processes is well known and we omit the corresponding calculations .",
    "the resulting expressions for probabilities of the processes of synchrotron radiation and pair production that depend on particles spins as well as on photon polarization are given in the appendixes .",

    "process probability decreases as @xmath17 if the difference @xmath18 increases therefore the transition @xmath19 is the most probable .",
    "the `` no spin - flip '' processes have identical dependence of probability on the stokes parameters .",
    "probability of the energetically favorable spin - flip process ( [ eq55 ] ) differs in the sign of the stokes parameter @xmath20 , therefore radiation has opposite linear polarization for spin - up  spin - down transitions .",

    "hereafter we will call it perpendicular photon polarization .",
    "if the polarization vector belongs to the same plane as the wave vector @xmath24 and the vector @xmath21 then equation @xmath25 is true and such polarization is called parallel polarization .    in the case of parallel polarization ( @xmath26 )",

    "probability of the spin - down  spin - up transition ( [ eq56 ] ) is minimal in this direction .",

    "@xcite , but there is not a complete clarity in understanding of this matter . in our opinion , the presence of singularities is associated with neglected emission of soft photons , which always accompanies quantum - electrodynamics processes .",
