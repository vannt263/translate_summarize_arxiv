    "results of recent photometric and spectroscopic studies of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) suggest that most ggcs consist of at least two stellar generations that are different in their radial distribution , chemical composition , and , probably , age ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "an often used explanation is that this could have happened because of extended star formation that has taken place in the ggcs and which has led to the enrichment of the second generation stars with light chemical elements ( such as such as li , na , al ) that were synthesized in the interiors of first generation stars . under such scenario ,",
    "most likely culprits responsible for the enrichment could have been either fast - rotating massive main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or intermediate mass agb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; note , however , that other explanations that do not involve the existence of multiple stellar generations have been proposed as well ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath2-body simulations predict that different stellar generations in the ggcs should differ in their spatial distributions and kinematical properties @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is plenty of evidence from recent photometric and spectroscopic studies indicating that second generation stars are more centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "however , kinematical properties of these different stellar generations are still largely unknown . in",
    "so far the only study of chemically - tagged stellar populations in the ggcs , @xcite have found no statistically significant relation between the abundance of sodium and either the velocity dispersion or systemic rotation of the cluster stars .",
    "only three clusters in their sample showed hints of dependence of radial velocity dispersion on the sodium abundance ( ngc  6388 , ngc  6441 , and ngc  2808 ) , although statistical significance of these trends was low .",
    "therefore , the question whether the different stellar generations that have been observed in many ggcs do indeed differ in their kinematical properties still remains to be answered .    in this study we investigated a sample of 101",
    "chemically tagged main - sequence turn - off ( to ) stars in the globular cluster 47  tuc , by focusing our attention on the possible relations between the chemical composition and spatial & kinematical properties of stars that belong to different stellar generations . in",
    "what follows below we briefly summarize the first results obtained in the course of this study ( for more results see @xcite and erniauskas et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "abundances of lithium , oxygen , and sodium that were used in our work were determined by @xcite .",
    "the abundances of all elements were measured in 101 to stars in 47  tuc , using for this purpose vlt  giraffe spectra obtained in the gratings hr15n , hr18 , and hr20a . in the case of oxygen and sodium",
    ", we first obtained their abundances in 1d  nlte and then corrected them for the 3d hydrodynamical effects , by adding 3d1d abundance corrections ( i.e. , the difference in the abundance of the chemical element that would be obtained from the given spectral line with the 3d hydrodynamical and 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres ) .",
    "abundance corrections were computed using 3d hydrodynamical co@xmath3bold  @xcite and 1d hydrostatic lhd  @xcite model atmospheres . in the case of lithium , we measured the equivalent widths of the resonance li  i 670.8  nm line and used the obtained equivalent widths along with the formula of @xcite to directly compute 3d  nlte lithium abundances ( for more details on the abundance determination see @xcite ) .    to study the connections between the chemical composition and kinematical properties of to stars in 47  tuc ,",
    "stars in our sample were divided into three groups according to their position in the @xmath4}}-{\\ensuremath{\\left[\\mathrm{na}/\\mathrm{o}\\right]}}$ ] plane : ( a ) primordial , p , with @xmath4}}>1.4 $ ] and @xmath5}}<-0.35 $ ] ; ( b ) extreme , e , with @xmath4 } } < 0.6 \\times { \\ensuremath{\\left[\\mathrm{li}/\\mathrm{o}\\right]}}+1.0 $ ] ; and ( c ) intermediate , i , which included all remaining stars having intermediate abundances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abund - kinem ] ) .",
    "the groups p , i , and e selected in our work approximately coincide with the three stellar generations studied in 47  tuc earlier by @xcite and @xcite , where stars were assigned to different groups according to their @xmath6}}$ ] and @xmath7}}$ ] ratios .",
    "let us note , however , that in making our selection we also tried to take into account kinematical information seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund - kinem ] , in such a way that the group p would include nearly all li - rich and na - poor ( o - rich ) stars with the highest absolute radial velocities , @xmath8  km / s ( here @xmath9 is radial velocity of the individual star and @xmath10 is the mean radial velocity of the cluster ) .",
    "this has ensured a better homogeneity of stars in all three groups in terms of their chemical _ and _ kinematical properties .    } } -{\\ensuremath{\\left[\\mathrm{na}/\\mathrm{o}\\right]}}$ ] plane .",
    "color - coding of individual symbols shows stars with different ( a ) absolute radial velocities of a given star in the reference frame of the cluster , @xmath11 ( top panel ) ; and ( b ) distance from the cluster center , @xmath12 ( bottom panel ; @xmath13 is the half - mass radius of 47  tuc taken from @xcite ) .",

    "s test performed on the fractional distributions of stars versus the radial distance showed that the probabilities for the groups p ",
    "e , and i  e being drawn from the same population were small and equal to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "similarly , k  s test performed on the fractional distributions of stars with respect to their absolute radial velocities showed that the probabilities in this case were equal to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .    radial distribution of the number ratios of stars in different groups , @xmath21 , determined in our study agrees well with those obtained by @xcite and @xcite from the analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data , respectively ( fig .",

    "our results therefore confirm that 47  tuc is not yet fully dynamically relaxed , which is in line with theoretical predictions from @xmath22-body simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our preliminary results based on the analysis of 101 to stars in the globular cluster 47  tuc suggest the existence of three stellar generations , which in terms of their @xmath1 $ ]  abundance ratios are similar to those found in this cluster by @xcite .",
    "our results also corroborate the existence of three stellar generations inferred in the analysis of @xcite , although the fractions of stars in each generation derived in the latter two studies and our work are slightly different ( due to differences in the selection criteria and stellar samples used ) .",
    "we find that the three stellar generations are different in terms of their radial distributions , with stars in primordial generation ( group p ) being less centrally concentrated than those in the subsequent generations ( i.e. , groups i and e ) .",
    "additionally , our results indicate that stars belonging to primordial generation are kinematically hotter than those in the later generations .",
    "all these findings suggest that evolutionary history of 47  tuc - and perhaps of other ggcs as well - may in fact be even more complex than previously thought , and therefore it awaits to be explored in the future studies based on the homogeneous analysis of larger numbers of stars .",
