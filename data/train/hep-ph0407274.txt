    "recent discovery of exotic baryons  @xcite revived the interest in hadron spectroscopy , especially that of exotic hadrons . among several models for exotic baryons ,",
    "promising one is the diquark model  @xcite , which assumes a strong correlation of two quarks in the color antitriplet channel . in the jaffe - wilczek ( jw )",
    "diquark model  @xcite , the exotic baryons are bound states of two scalar diquarks and one antiquark .",
    "the salient features of jw model are the occurrence of low - dimensional multiplets and small mass difference among the members in the multiplet , which were soon supported by the na49 experiment  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the extremely narrow decay width of exotic baryons was naturally explained in the diquark picture of exotic baryons , where the decay process is suppressed by tunnelling among two diquarks  @xcite .    as the existence of hadrons containing quarks",
    "more than three is logically possible , its absence in the low - lying hadronic spectroscopy has been a puzzle since the advent of the quark model  @xcite . in late seventies , jaffe suggested that the positive - parity scalar mesons of mass less than @xmath0 might be bound states of multi quarks , forming a @xmath1 nonet  @xcite . in his scheme",
    ", the scalar nonet is postulated to be the non - exotic components of 4-quark states ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the quark content of light scalar mesons has been controversial and still is  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was argued that @xmath3 , the lightest member in the scalar nonet , is not a pure @xmath4 state but mostly a four - quark state , using the unitarity argument in the large @xmath5 analysis  @xcite .",
    "( see also a recent paper for the diquark picture of scalar mesons  @xcite . )    in this paper , we assume that the scalar nonet is a bound sate of a diquark and an anti - diquark and calculate the decay width of scalar nonet to compare with the experimental data  @xcite , using the diquark chiral effective theory  @xcite .",
    "the success of quark model in hadron spectroscopy is understood in the framework of the chiral quark effective theory ( @xmath6qet ) , derived by georgi and manohar  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6qet is an effective theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) below the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath7 but above the confinement scale , @xmath8 .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom of the effective theory therefore contains quarks , gluons and the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons of spontaneously broken @xmath9 chiral symmetry .",
    "the chiral quark effective lagrangian is given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the qcd covariant derivative , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the pion decay constant , @xmath14 the nambu - goldstone fields @xmath15 with @xmath16 . in @xmath6qet",
    "the higher - order terms or explicit chiral symmetry breaking terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath17 .",
    "the typical size of symmetry breaking terms is @xmath18 therefore , they make only small contributions to the naive quark model .",
    "furthermore , by matching with qcd , one finds the axial coupling and the strong coupling to be small as well , @xmath19 and @xmath20 so that the perturbation is reliable .",
    "this is why the naive quark model is so successful in describing non - exotic hadrons  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the success of diquark picture for exotic hadrons may be explained by the diquark chiral effective theory ( d@xmath6et ) , proposed recently by sohn , zahed , and one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "since the diquarks have mass around @xmath21  @xcite , they fit naturally in the range where the @xmath6qet is applicable . hence ,",
    "in addition to the relevant degrees of freedom of @xmath6qet , the diquark chiral effective theory involves one more degree of freedom , namely a diquark field , defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a mass scale for the diquark field , @xmath24 is the anomalous dimension of the diquark correlator and the greek indices denote colors , while the latin indices @xmath25 denote flavors .",
    "@xmath26 is a charge conjugated field of a quark field , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "( here we consider only scalar diquarks , since tensor diquarks  @xcite do not contribute to light scalar mesons . )",
    "the diquark chiral effective lagrangian is described by @xmath29 where higher - order interactions of diquarks and quarks is denoted as @xmath30 , which may contain the ( chirally ) covariant derivatives . in this paper",
    ", we will take @xmath31 from the random instanton model  @xcite and @xmath32 , the best value fitting the scalar nonet mass  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa coupling splits diquark masses , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . and the binding energy between a diquark and an antidiquark in scalar nonet is @xmath35 .",
    "we list these parameters in table [ previous ] .",
    ".the best - fit parameters in @xcite .",
    "they are obtained from the random instanton model and the scalar nonet masses . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once we determine the axial couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we calculate in the next section the decay width of @xmath38 in its subdominant mode to see if d@xmath6et works .",
    "since the mass of two kaons is larger than @xmath38 mass , we can not obtain the decay width with eq .",
    "( [ naive2 ] ) .",
    "the broadening of @xmath38 makes the decay into two kaons possible . so the broadening should be considered in order to calculate the decay mode into two kaons . keeping the basic picture",
    ", we introduce the breit - wigner form to revise eq .",
    "( [ naive2 ] ) ; @xmath39 with scalar mass @xmath40 and total decay width @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is @xmath43 and @xmath44 is chosen to be the larger one between the threshold value for the decay mode and @xmath45 .",
    "so @xmath46 for @xmath47 mode .",
    "the wavefunction at the origin and the final momentum are modified as @xmath48 and @xmath49 in ( [ res ] ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath50 is adjusted by @xmath51 since @xmath52 is dominant among @xmath38 decay modes , we will use @xmath53 in table [ width1 ] for @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) .",
    "then we obtain 75 mev with set 1 and 59 mev with set 2 for @xmath55 .",
    "experimentally @xmath56 is 0.14 @xmath57 0.32 and the full decay width of @xmath38 is @xmath58  @xcite . we find our result is a few times larger than the experimental value , @xmath59 . considering the experimental uncertainty and the crude approximation we made for the bound state wavefunction , our result is not too bad .",
    "we calculate the decay width of light scalar mesons in the framework of the diquark chiral effective theory , which was introduced recently to describe exotic hadrons like pentaquarks . using the parameters fixed previously by the mass of scalar mesons , we determine the axial couplings of diquarks with pions and kaons from the experimental data for the decay width of scalars in the dominant decay modes .",
    "the axial couplings turned out to be small , showing that the naive diquark model of jaffe and wilczek is reliable .",
    "then , we calculate the decay width of scalar mesons for the subdominant channel and find that our result is not far off from the experimental data .    to conclude , in the diquark chiral effective theory , based on the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and the diquark picture of exotic hadrons , we find the decay width of scalar mesons in good agreement of experimental data .",
    "it shows that the diquark chiral effective theory captures correct physics of exotic hadrons .",
