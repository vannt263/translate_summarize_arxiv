    "a vast majority of cloaking nanostructures are engineered in the basis of transformation optics principles @xcite enabling analytical expressions of the electromagnetic fields and metamaterial properties @xcite . an original concept suggested by alu and engheta",
    "has also attracted great attention which relies on the use of metamaterial ( or metal ) coatings to severely drop the scattering efficiency of an object by means of a nonresonant scattering - cancellation approach @xcite .",
    "the strategy of such scattering cancellation takes advantage of the local negative polarizability of metamaterials , and its experimental realization was first demonstrated at microwave frequencies by using an array of metallic fins which are embedded in a high - permittivity environment to generate a metamaterial cloaking shell @xcite .",
    "novel extensions of the previous concepts have more recently made the scene , which are based on the use of double - shell and multilayered plasmonic coatings @xcite .",
    "for instance , using plasmonic shells with an epsilon - near - zero material enables to reduce substantially the scattering losses and simultaneously providing the shielding of the cloaked region @xcite . as an alternative ,",
    "a nanotube consisting of a periodic distribution of metal and dielectric alternating layers , where the stratified metamaterial was described as a radial - anisotropic hyperbolic medium , has recently demonstrated narrow - band ultra - low scattering @xcite .",
    "the invisibility spectral band occurs when one of the components of the effective permittivity tensor is near zero .",
    "the effective medium theory was adopted to efficiently reproduce the results provided by the analytical lorenz - mie scattering method @xcite . here",

    "@xcite for different combinations , that is , when the layer in contact with the environment medium is either the metal or the nonconducting material .",
    "we demonstrated that boundary effects play a relevant role in the resulting scattering efficiency of the nanotube , potentially clearing away the characteristic invisibility of the nanotube and boosting additional plasmonic resonances in the visible .",
    "explicitly , when silver is set as the constituent material of the outermost layer , unexpectedly , a significant enhancement of the scattered signal is observed . as a consequence , the effective medium theory enabling a simplified model for the optical characterization of the nanoparticle may apparently lead to fallacious estimations even for metamaterials composed of subwavelength layers with a few - nanometers width .",

    "[ fig03 ] , the calculated @xmath41 exhibits significant discrepancies when the inmost layer is either ag or tio@xmath1 , despite @xmath12 and @xmath13 remain the same in both cases .",
    "when the interior layer is made of silver , the scattering efficiency of the nanostructure reaches a minimum of @xmath42 at @xmath43  nm , as reported in ref .",

    "in addition , a high peak of @xmath46 is found at @xmath47  nm , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . however , the number of resonant peaks increases if titanium dioxide is set in the inmost layer . in this case ,",
    "the highest peak is located at a wavelength of 560  nm where the scattering efficiency yields @xmath50 , and a secondary strong peak is found at @xmath51  nm ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in addition , its minimum in scattering efficiency is shifted at @xmath53  nm where importantly it reaches a value of @xmath54 .",
    "we point out that such minimum in scattering efficiency , which is far of being associated with invisibility , is one order of magnitude higher than that estimated previously for an ag inmost coating .",
    "finally , a dissimilar behavior in scattering is also manifested for tm@xmath27-polarized incident light ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .    in order to provide a physical insight of such a behavior",

    "when silver is set in the inmost layer of the hyperbolic metamaterial , we observe a moderate enhancement of the field at three different ag - tio@xmath1 interfaces , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04](a ) , which corresponds to a collective excitation of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) .",
    "it is clear that the field exhibits strong irregularities derived from nonlocal effects in the multilayered metal - dielectric nanostructure @xcite .",
    "though such phenomenon severely puts into question the validity of the effective medium approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the deviations from an average field inside the hyperbolic nanotube are moderate in this case . analyzing the case that titanium dioxide is placed in contact with the interior medium , however , we observe even abrupter variations of the field especially at the rear part of the nanotube ( in the semi - space @xmath56 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04](b ) .",
    "furthermore , now the field distribution is clearly asymmetric with respect to the origin of coordinates , leaving a strong backscattered signal .",
    "finally , we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] that the field amplitude at the center of the nanotube and in its neighborhood is , in average , near the field remaining in the environment medium rather than zero .",
    "this fact evidences that the shielding effect that commonly is recognized in epsilon - near - zero core - shell nanocylinders @xcite can not be reproduced in our hyperbolic metamaterial nanotube when the light impinges under te@xmath27 polarization .",
    "the following analyzes the effects of increasing the number of layers in our nanotube maintaining the thickness @xmath24  nm and the metal filling factor @xmath26 of the shell , implying that the layer width @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the metamaterial is reduced .",
    "considering 12 alternating layers of silver and titanium dioxide , the layer width ( and the period of the multilayered nanostructure ) is reduced to one half with respect to the cases analyzed above and illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig03 ] and [ fig04 ] .",
    "the scattering efficiency of such additional nanotube is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , considering the examples where the inmost layer is either ag or tio@xmath1 ; the efficiency @xmath41 is again evaluated by means of the lorenz - mie scattering method .",
    "when the layer in contact with the core is silver , we find a minimum of @xmath41 equal to @xmath57 at a wavelength @xmath58  nm , representing an exiguous variation in comparison with the hyperbolic nanotube of 6 layers .",
    "in addition , the maximum of scattering efficiency reaches a value of @xmath59 at @xmath60  nm . if now we consider a nanotube with the interior layer made of tio@xmath1 , its scattering efficiency at the invisibility wavelength @xmath58  nm reaches a value of @xmath61 , representing a factor of 25 with respect to the case previously analyzed .",
    "in fact , the minimum of the scattering efficiency is @xmath62 , which is found at @xmath63  nm .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath41 , however , becomes relatively similar in both cases .",
    "the profile of the magnetic field at the new invisibility wavelength @xmath58  nm again exhibits abrupt changes at the metal - dielectric interfaces , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06](a ) for a nanotube with inmost layer made of ag , but the envelope enabling the estimation of an average value presents a slow variation inside the metamaterial .",
    "moreover , a minimum of intensity is found near the origin of coordinates , however such intensity is far of zero disabling the gain of a shielding effect . in fig .  [ fig06](b ) we represent the magnetic field of the nanotube at the invisibility wavelength of @xmath58  nm , considering a nanotube of interior layer made of tio@xmath1 .",
    "the resonant excitation of collective spps at the rear part of the nanocylinder , developing a chief ( inhomogeneous ) bloch wave in the multilayered metamaterial @xcite , seems to be responsible of the significant increase in the scattering efficiency and subsequently the predominant visibility of the nanotube .",
    "now this is clear that the appearance of a predominant radially - evanescent bloch wave also occurs for a 6-layer nanostructure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04](b ) .",
    "obviously , by including a higher number of layers and , at the same time , maintaining the thickness @xmath64 of the nanotube and the filling factor @xmath65 of the metamaterial , both the scattering efficiency spectrum and the field pattern will continuously approach for the ag and tio@xmath1 ending layers , leading to the response of a purely hyperbolic nanotube @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig07](a ) shows the scattering efficiency @xmath41 of a hollow nanocylinder of thickness @xmath24  nm and total diameter @xmath25  nm , which is composed of a hyperbolic metamaterial with components of its permittivity tensor as given by eqs .",

    "the calculations were carried out by using the lorenz - mie scattering method described in refs .",
    "@xcite . the minimum efficiency ( @xmath66 ) is found at @xmath67  nm establishing the invisibility wavelength , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the main efficiency peak reaching @xmath70 is localized at @xmath71  nm . the field distribution in the nanotube is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig07](b ) at the invisibility wavelength @xmath67  nm . we observe the formation of surface waves in the two air - hyperbolic metamaterial interfaces . in average , this field pattern is closer to the field distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06](a ) for an ag inmost layer than that exhibited for a nanostructured tube of ag ending coating depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig06](b ) . at the rear part of the nanotube ,",
    "the field oscillations inside the multilayered metamaterial becomes stronger near the core ; however , a surface wave at the metamaterial - core interface is only produced when a silver layer remains in contact with the core , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06](a ) but not in fig .",
    "[ fig06](b ) .",
    "in summary , we investigated numerically the scattering efficiency , with emphasis in the invisibility regime , of multilayered ag - tio@xmath1 nanotubes with configurations of a different ending layer .",
    "we demonstrated that when the nonconducting layer remains in contact with the core of the hollow cylinder , the characteristic invisibility of the hyperbolic nanotube is cleared away , even considering elementary layers of a few nanometers . in this case",
    "there is an additional boosting of plasmonic - bloch resonances markedly observed on the wave fields localized at the rear part of the multilayered nanocylinder .",
    "furthermore , the effective medium theory enabling a simplified model for the optical characterization of the nanoparticle will lead to fallacious estimations . such effect becomes weaker for metamaterials composed of subwavelength layers with less - than-5-nanometers width .",
