    "the total mass - to - light ratio of field galaxies multiplied with the field luminosity density gives , by definition , the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the complications in the measurement are to provide unbiased mass estimates and to measure any luminosity difference between the galaxies for which total system masses are known and field galaxies .",
    "small , dense systems , like individual galaxies and small groups , exhibit `` luminosity segregation '' where the luminosity distribution is more concentrated than the mass distribution @xcite . the largest virialized structures  rich clusters  indicate @xmath9 , but these measurements may be biased by luminosity segregation and differential evolution of the very red cluster galaxies as compared to bluer field galaxies . on even larger scales , where overdense structures are still expanding , but retarded from the hubble flow , bulk flows of galaxies measure the parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the assumed linear bias , @xmath12 , relating the tracer galaxy number densities and the mass field density .",
    "the flow measurements tentatively indicated @xmath13 @xcite , but recent increases in sample size and new analyses indicate possible compatibility with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath0 is of considerable interest as the `` natural '' value ( the `` dicke coincidence '' ) for a universe that has expanded many e - folds , and as the value originally predicted by inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 and all the dark matter falls into clusters along with galaxies ( as it must if it is collisionless and cold ) , then rich clusters , which draw their mass from regions 10  in radius , must have a total virialized mass - to - light ratio , @xmath14 , about 2.5 to 5 times higher than the standard virial analysis gives .",
    "the cluster data did not rule out such high @xmath15 values in the field , due to unconstrained systematic errors in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) sample was designed to create a dataset that allows complete internal control of most aspects of the cluster @xmath7 estimate , especially luminosity segregation and differential evolution of cluster galaxies relative to the field .",
    "the cluster sample was chosen from the einstein medium sensitivity survey catalogue of x - ray clusters @xcite to have a high x - ray luminosity , which helps guarantee that the clusters are reasonably virialized , suggests that they will contain many galaxies , and allows other cosmological measurements .",
    "the sample was augmented with a2390 to fill an ra gap .",
    "the clusters are at @xmath18 so they have a significant redshift interval over which the surrounding field galaxies are nearly uniformly sampled in redshift .",
    "observations were made at cfht in 24 assigned nights in 1993 and 1994 , of which 22 were usefully clear .",
    "the primary catalogues contain gunn @xmath19 magnitudes and @xmath20 colors for 25,000 objects , plus radial velocity measurements at an average accuracy of 100  @xcite for a subsample of 2600 .",
    "all results are reported for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the overall cnoc program is encapsulated as follows :    the main results from this ongoing program of investigation are summarized below but discussed in detail in a series of papers .",
    "the observational methods , which are designed to efficiently measure redshifts of galaxies in the primary sample , are discussed in yee , ellingson & carlberg ( 1996 ) .",
    "the measurement of global quantities , such as the velocity dispersion and virial mass - to - light ratio , is done in carlberg ,  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the average mass and light profiles are compared in carlberg , yee & ellingson ( 1997 ) to measure the biases of the virial mass - to - light ratio and correct the luminosities of cluster galaxies to field galaxy values .",
    "carlberg ,  ( 1997a ) shows that the same mass profile can be recovered from two independent and very different subsamples of the cluster data .",
    "the average mass profile is compared to a theoretical prediction in carlberg ,  ( 1997b ) , finding an impressive agreement .",
    "the sample was designed such that the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuation spectrum could be measured on cluster scales , with the results given in carlberg , ( 1997b ) .",
    "some preliminary results of the cnoc field survey , now comprising about 2/3 of the 5000 primary sample redshifts , are given below .",
    "the virial mass is @xmath24 where 1  is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and @xmath25 is the virial radius of the observed galaxies @xcite . deciding which galaxies in redshift space are cluster members is fundamentally ambiguous .",
    "that is , a cluster galaxy with a completely reasonable line - of - sight velocity of @xmath26 appears in redshift space at 10  from the cluster s center of mass , far outside the virialized cluster and intermingled with field galaxies .",
    "this complication increases in severity as the cluster density declines with projected distance from the cluster center where our sample is specifically intended to probe .",
    "our straightforward solution to this problem is to subtract the mean density of field galaxies in redshift space from the redshift space of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersions are about 13% lower than precisely the same cluster data give without background subtraction .",
    "gratifyingly , our velocity dispersions are in excellent agreement with those inferred from the mean x - ray temperatures @xcite .",
    "our estimate of @xmath25 uses a `` ringwise '' estimate , rather than the traditional `` pointwise '' estimate @xcite .",
    "this allows us to include a selection function for the roughly rectangular window on the sky which outlines the fields and it helps to reduce noise in the estimated virial radius .",
    "the ringwise estimator overestimates the virial radius of the clusters because it does not account for their flattening .",
    "we use the mean of the ratio of the ringwise to the pointwise estimator , which is about 1.28 , to make this correction .",
    "the ringwise estimator includes a small `` softening '' , of one arcsec , to avoid a divergence when two galaxies are at the same radius .",
    "the total galaxy luminosity of the cluster galaxies in ratio to @xmath16 gives @xmath14 , an estimate of the total mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the average k - corrected gunn @xmath19 @xmath14 , for @xmath27 mag but integrated to infinity with the luminosity function ( @xmath28 mag , @xmath29 ) , is @xmath30 at @xmath31 . if corrected for pure luminosity evolution at the rate of 1 magnitude of brightening per unit redshift the mean gunn @xmath19 @xmath14 extrapolates to @xmath32 at redshift zero .",
    "the mean standard error per cluster on average is 40% , although this can be reduced to 25% by eliminating the clusters with large errors .",
    "a major result is that @xmath14 is the same for all clusters once minimal passive evolution of the cluster galaxies is taken into account @xcite .",
    "for the 15 clusters displayed in figure  1 @xmath33 which is about 28% probable for @xmath34 degrees of freedom , that is , consistent with no intrinsic variation .",
    "x - ray @xcite and weak lensing analyses @xcite generally find results in accord with these .",
    "our observations extend over what is expected to be the entire virialized volume of the cluster .",
    "analytic models @xcite and simulations @xcite find that the virialized mass is generally contained inside the surface where the mean interior density is approximately @xmath35 , which defines the radius 200 .",
    "the small extrapolation from the observationally derived @xmath25 to 200  assumes @xmath36 , which gives @xmath37,$ ] where @xmath38 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath39 .",
    "the accuracy of the virial mass depends on the tracer galaxies having the same distribution as the mass .",
    "we compare the light - traces - mass profile , @xmath40 , to the dynamical mass profile , @xmath41 , derived from the jeans equation , @xmath42          = -{{gm_d(r)}\\over{r^2 } } , \\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "this equation does not depend on the density of the tracer galaxies , @xmath44 , following the mass density profile , @xmath45 .    to create an effectively spherical cluster and to reduce the effects of substructure , all the cluster galaxies",
    "are combined into one `` ensemble '' cluster by normalizing the velocities to 1  and the projected radii to the 200  value of each cluster .",
    "the two quantities measured from this distribution are the surface number density profile of cluster galaxies , @xmath46 , shown in figure  2 , and the projected velocity dispersion profile , figure  3 .",
    "the volume number density profile is modeled as @xmath47 , $ ] where @xmath48 for the navarro , frenk & white function ( 1997 , hereafter nfw ) and @xmath49 for hernquist s ( 1990 ) form .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is modeled as @xmath50/ [ 1 + r / b]$ ] , where @xmath51 and @xmath11 are the two parameters adjusted to fit the observed @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameters are externally fixed to vary the shape of the curve .",
    "the velocity anisotropy is taken as an approximate fit to the results of n - body simulations .",
    "a range of @xmath55 fits are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the resulting ratio , @xmath56 shown in figure  4 , is not very sensitive to the details of the velocity modeling .",
    "there are two conclusions to be drawn from figure  4 .",
    "first , over a range of about two decades of projected density or three decades of volume density , the integrated galaxy distribution traces the mass distribution to an accuracy of about 20% or better .",
    "second , the virial mass is always an overestimate of the true mass contained within that radius , which we estimate to be a factor @xmath57 .",
    "we attribute the mass overestimate of @xmath16 to dropping the surface pressure term at @xmath58 in the virial theorem ,  @xmath59 .",
    "simple modeling of an equilibrium cluster shows that truncating the data at 200  will cause @xmath16 to be upward biased at the 15 - 25% level that is inferred from the jeans equation .",
    "splitting the cluster sample into independent blue and red subsamples demonstrates that the clusters are effectively in equilibrium and that the results are robust for drastically different samples .",
    "these two subsamples also illustrate the perils of the virial mass estimator .",
    "the blue galaxies are about twice as extended and have a 20% higher velocity dispersion than the red galaxies , figure  5 .",
    "consequently the blue galaxies indicate a virial mass about three times larger than the red galaxies give .",
    "however each of these subsamples independently gives the same mass profile from the jeans equation as found from the full sample , which we take as strong support for the assumption that both subsamples are effectively in equilibrium with the cluster potential @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that galaxies with red colours are somewhat more concentrated than the total mass distribution , so the procedure of comparing the mass profile to the `` red - sequence '' light profile is likely to give a rising mass - to - light ratio .    the scale radius , @xmath60 ,",
    "is predicted to be a relatively large 0.20 - 0.26 of 200 , for simulations normalized to the observed cluster cosmological density , but otherwise the prediction is relatively insensitive to cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "it is a significant success of the generalized cdm model that the observed scale radius @xmath61 ( 95% confidence ) is in complete accord with nfw s prediction .",
    "the normalization of the density fluctuation spectrum is fundamental to all predictions of structure formation .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the variance of the linear density perturbation spectrum in 8spheres .",
    "the cnoc cluster sample and observational strategy @xcite were specifically designed to produce data useful for a @xmath5 measurement .",
    "the sample s primary advantage is that the cluster masses are accurately known near the virial radius , which is essential for a reliable estimate of the linear mass scale from which the cluster collapsed .",
    "we combine our data with similarly selected clusters from the emss @xcite and eso cluster surveys @xcite to extend the redshift range of the cosmological density estimates .",
    "the cluster cosmological density data are modeled @xcite to constrain the @xmath62 pair .",
    "it is not observationally straightforward to give accurately the full virialized mass of a cluster , but it is straightforward to extrapolate the mass inside some specified aperture , conventionally the abell radius , 1.5 .",
    "the measurement of cluster mass inside a fixed aperture is effectively a mass weighted velocity dispersion or temperature .",
    "the measured redshift change of the cosmological density of clusters , having @xmath63 requires some small corrections for the effects of x - ray selection , which are incorporated in the data of figure  6 .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified because the @xmath64 relation has no detectable redshift evolution , as is also seen in the x - ray temperatures @xcite .",
    "the cluster cosmological density data are best described with @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( 90% confidence ) , figure  7 . taking the @xmath7 from cluster dynamical analysis as @xmath67",
    ", we find @xmath68 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the predicted cluster density evolution in an @xmath0 cdm model exceeds that observed at @xmath69 by more than an order of magnitude , as shown in figure  6 .",
    "it is essential for @xmath7 measurement to understand the differential evolution of cluster galaxies relative to field galaxies .",
    "the cluster galaxy population is on the average redder than the field , but the cluster population has an increasing blue fraction with redshift @xcite .",
    "the origin of the blue cluster population has three basic possibilities .",
    "one possibility is cluster galaxies formed in a different way than field galaxies , with fundamentally different star formation rates at all epochs .",
    "however , hierarchical clustering leads one to to expect that cluster galaxies originated in the field , and hence share a similar early star formation history which is altered in some way upon entry into the cluster .",
    "ultimately star formation is greatly suppressed in cluster galaxies : however , there are two routes to this state . either there was a burst of star formation upon entry into the cluster which largely exhausted the galaxy s gas supply , or ,",
    "the gas was simply swept out of the galaxy @xcite .    in figure  8",
    "we show the equivalent width of the [ oii]3727  line as a function of radial distance from the cluster center , which is the projected distance in the inner region and the redshift space distance for the field galaxies .",
    "the sample is limited at a common @xmath70 mag , with an additional cut to eliminate low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "the measured equivalent width implies a mean star formation rate of approximately @xmath71  yr@xmath72 in our clusters @xcite . over @xmath73 years",
    "this will add only a few percent stellar mass to the relatively high luminosity galaxies in our sample .",
    "of particular note is that there is no evidence for a significant increase in star formation rate at any radius .",
    "clusters do contain objects with strong emission lines , mostly near the cluster `` edge '' , but these are rare compared to the field .",
    "we conclude that the difference between cluster and field galaxy evolution is that star formation is truncated upon the entry of galaxies into the cluster @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the cluster galaxy population should be dominated by a passively evolving stellar population .",
    "the cnoc survey has the advantage that the masses derived for each cluster can be used to normalize the luminosity functions of each cluster so that the redshift evolution of @xmath74 can be measured .",
    "the evolution of the parameters of schechter fits to the luminosity functions of galaxies having @xmath75 more luminous than approximately @xmath76 mag is shown in figure  9 .",
    "the @xmath77 parameter measures the evolution of @xmath78 with redshift ( the faint end slope is held fixed at @xmath79 , the best fit value ) as @xmath80 .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity density , @xmath81 , is nearly statistically orthogonal to @xmath78 .",
    "we model @xmath81 as an evolution in magnitudes , @xmath82 .",
    "these luminosity function and evolution parameters are found using a parametric maximum likelihood technique @xcite applied to 1838 field galaxies and 1018 cluster galaxies above the sample limits .",
    "we find that to a good approximation the density evolution parameters @xmath83 ( consistent with zero ) indicating that there is little density evolution of cluster galaxies , as we expect for these high velocity dispersion clusters where merging and star formation are insignificant .",
    "we find @xmath84 , which n accord with predictions of purely passive evolution of a predominantly old stellar population of current at @xmath8515 gyr today . in the field",
    "( @xmath86 ) , we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 , nearly identical to the cluster values .",
    "nearly identical values are inferred from this approach to the analysis of the cfrs data @xcite .",
    "the mean field star formation rate that we infer from [ oii ] over the @xmath89 interval is only about @xmath90  yr@xmath72 for galaxies more luminous than @xmath91 with a weak redshift dependence .",
    "this low mean star formation rate would add about 5 - 10% more stellar mass to an @xmath78 galaxy ( close to the sample mean and median ) over this redshift interval , consistent with a mild field luminosity evolution and a modest difference between cluster and field .",
    "these results are supported by direct , cosmological model independent , measurements of the surface brightness of the galaxy spheroids and disks @xcite .",
    "we conclude that field galaxies evolve roughly in parallel to cluster galaxies , although cluster galaxies have lower luminosity @xmath78 , by @xmath92 mag in b , or using different procedures , @xmath93 mag in @xmath19 .",
    "simple stellar population modeling for truncated star formation shows that this is consistent with the mean colour difference of about 0.2 mag .",
    "the fading of cluster galaxies relative to the field is an essential , but relatively small , correction in the @xmath7 estimate .",
    "we interpret the butcher - oemler effect as likely being the result of blue , star forming , field galaxies falling into clusters at a rate that increases with redshift , although this remains to be quantified and tested .",
    "cluster data allow a measurement of the geometry of the universe , using the following procedure . the mass density of the universe , @xmath8 , is a conserved quantity which is estimated with the product of @xmath94 and @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath94 is estimated from the clusters , with a relatively small correction , 10 - 30% , to allow for differential evolution with respect to the field .",
    "the luminosity density , @xmath81 , involves the volume element , which is strongly @xmath95 dependent .",
    "if these quantities are calculated using the values of @xmath96 and @xmath4 that the real universe has , then @xmath97 will be constant at @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the `` wrong '' values are assumed , then the calculated @xmath98 will be dependent on redshift .",
    "for instance , if we assume that @xmath99 , but in fact @xmath22 , @xmath100 , then @xmath98 will rise 76% from z=0.2 to z=0.8 , which is easily detectable in samples of the cnoc size but having a larger redshift range . note that this effect exceeds the entire differential evolution between field and cluster by a factor of two , and that the redshift variation in the differential evolution is even smaller .",
    "although we will correct for galaxy evolution effects , they are small compared to the geometry changes we are trying to measure .",
    "the main goal of the cnoc survey is to use clusters of galaxies to derive a value of @xmath96 with a well determined error budget .",
    "the major innovation of our analysis is that it is completely self - contained , with the key assumptions being testable , and that the error estimates are derived from the data themselves .",
    "the dominant source of error is random cluster - to - cluster variations , rather than the internal error from individual clusters .",
    "the global mass - to - light ratio ( in our photometric system , at mean redshift of @xmath31 , with k - corrections , but without evolution corrections ) of our sample clusters of galaxies is constant within our typical errors of 25% at a value of @xmath30 . over the same redshift range we measure the closure value , @xmath101 , to be @xmath102 @xcite . after allowing for the @xmath103 mag lower luminosities of cluster galaxies and reducing @xmath16 by @xmath57",
    ", we find that @xmath104 . in an independent luminosity function analysis ,",
    "the evolution corrected @xmath105 value of @xmath14 leads to @xmath106 with a similar error budget .",
    "there are no variations of the radial mass - to - light profile within the clusters , nor is there any variation with redshift .",
    "this requires any additional form of dark matter to be sufficiently hot that it does not fall into clusters , but perhaps participates in large scale flows .",
    "this is a very narrow parameter range and produces trouble for the evolution of the density perturbation spectrum .",
    "the most likely form of additional mass - energy , if it exists , is in the form of @xmath2 , which additional cluster plus field observations in a neo - classical volume - redshift test can easily detect .",
    "two aspects of the cluster mass evolution are particularly satisfying .",
    "the derived @xmath96 accurately predicts the observed evolution of cluster cosmological density . with our value of @xmath96",
    "we find that @xmath68 .",
    "moreover the same @xmath7 in a cool , dark matter dominated universe , predicts remarkably accurately the `` morphology '' of the clusters , at least as encapsulated in the nfw results for the mean mass profile . for this low density cosmology the measured rate of both structural evolution ,",
    "figure  10 @xcite , and galaxy evolution , figure  9 , over our redshift range is consistent with a formation `` freeze out '' at some @xmath107 , and possibly much higher .",
    "there are considerable opportunities to refine and extend these results in a number of different directions . for the current sample",
    "these include improved coverage at 1 - 3200  to constrain the luminosity profile at large radius , which would lead to a tighter comparison with the core radius predictions and the slope at large radius .",
    "the same data would advance the empirical study of how field galaxies are altered upon infall into the cluster .",
    "the turnaround radius is at about 5200 .",
    "if the sample extended to projected radii well beyond turnaround , then there would be a clear measurement of the infall into the cluster , which is a `` bulk flow '' , hence measures the @xmath108 parameter .",
    "such a measurement would directly compare the cluster @xmath7 estimate with a field @xmath10 measurement to resolve the large scatter present in the current estimates from flows . at these large radii",
    "many of the galaxies would be distant field galaxies , but their immense value is to provide a good estimate of the unperturbed background density , which is an essential ingredient in the measurement . including the four high redshift emss clusters would allow an @xmath4 measurement with a precision of about @xmath109 to be made . with an efficient multi - object spectrograph on a 4 meter telescope",
    ", it takes 1 - 2 nights to observe a cluster at @xmath110 .",
    "more ambitiously one can imagine in the near future assembling much larger cluster samples to improve the precision of these cosmological parameter estimates to the few percent level that cosmic microwave background experiments hope to attain .",
    "for instance , a sample of 200 - 300 clusters , with the accompanying field , spread more or less uniformly over the @xmath6 range would allow @xmath3 to be measured to a precision of about 2 - 3% and @xmath4 to be measured to about 5% .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter could be measured to a precision of better than 1% , which would become a very strong constraint on the overall spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the galaxy evolution parameters would be measured at about 5% precision and would challenge stellar population models , and might even begin to rival globular clusters as tools to measure the age of the universe . however , this would also take some advances in modeling precision .",
    "the realistic errors are likely to be about twice as large , since new residual systematic errors will be uncovered and removed as the dataset grows . at redshifts beyond about @xmath111 the first problem is to find clusters in some systematic manner .",
    "this is mainly a matter of systematic sky surveys of various sorts .",
    "it should be noted that , in the @xmath112 range of the emss / cnoc survey , we selected only 15 clusters that are sufficiently rich that they are easy to study from 584 square degrees of sky .",
    "the implication is that these large , rich , easily - studied clusters are rather scarce on the sky .",
    "nevertheless , once found , clusters of this sort will be exceptionally powerful as direct probes of both cosmological processes and cosmological parameters .",
    "such programs will be feasible with a number of the new generation of telescopes .",
