    "this led to a new algebraic structure called the z - algebra @xcite which gave a formal foundation to study systematically the connection between affine lie algebras and combinatorial identities .",
    "in particular , lepowsky and wilson @xcite used the z - algebra structure to construct the integrable highest weight representations of the affine lie algebra @xmath15 and gave a @xmath16-algebraic proof of the rogers - ramanujan identities and @xmath16-algebraic interpretation of the generalized rogers - ramanujan identities .",

    "however , on @xmath18 many of these @xmath16-operators are scalar multiples of each other .",
