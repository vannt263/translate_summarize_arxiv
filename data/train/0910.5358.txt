    "nonclassical states play an important role in quantum computation and quantum imformation procession @xcite .",
    "the nonclassicality of quantum states can be well - described by some nonclassical properties , such as sub - poissonian photon ststistics @xcite , squeezing in one of the quadratures of the field @xcite , and negativity of wigner function ( wf ) @xcite . especially , the partial negativity of wf implies the highly nonclassical properties of quantum states and is often used to describe the decoherence of quantum states .",
    "many experimental schemes have been proposed to generate nonclassical states of optical field . among them , subtracting photons form and/or adding photons to quantum states have been paid much attention because these fields exhibit an abundant of nonclassical properties and may give access to a complete engineering of quantum states and to fundamental quantum phenomena @xcite . for example , a single photon - subtraction squeezed vacuum ( pssv ) has been experimentally prepared with a pulsed and continuous wave squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is very similar to quantum superpositions of coherent states with small amplitudes @xcite . as another example",
    ", a single - photon addition was experimentally performed by zavatta _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which unveils the nonclassical features associated with the excitation of a classical coherent field by a single light quantum .",
    "for the single pssv , its nonclassical properties and decoherence was investigated theoretically in two different decoherent channels ( amplitude decay and phase damping ) by biswas and agarwal @xcite .",
    "they indicated that the wf losses its non - gaussian nature and becomes gaussian at long times in amplitude decay case .",
    "on the other hand , the combination of the photon addition and subtraction has been successfully demonstrated in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , photon addition and subtraction",
    "experimentally have been employed to probe quantum commutation rules by parigi _",
    "et al_. in fact , they have implemented simple alternated sequences of photon creation ( addition ) and annihilation ( subtraction ) on a thermal field and observed the noncommutativity of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it is interesting to notice that subtracting or adding one photon from / to pure squeezed vacuums can generate the same output state , i.e. , squeezed single - photon state @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting states obtained by successive photon subtractions or additions are different from each other .",
    "for instance , successive two - photon additions [ @xmath2 and successive two - photon subtractions [ @xmath3 will result in the same state produced by using subtraction - addition ( @xmath4 ) and addition - subtraction ( @xmath5 ) , ( also see section 2 below ) respectively . as far as we know , the nonclassicality and decoherence of arbitrary number photon - added squeezed vacuum states ( pasv ) in a dissipative channel has not been derived analytically in the literature before .    in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate the nonclassical properties and decoherence of single - mode pasv which is optically produced single - mode non - gaussian states .",
    "this work is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the single - mode pasv and discuss its nonclassicality in terms of sub - poissonian statistics and the negativity of its wigner function ( wf ) . by converting the pasv to a squeezed hermite polynomial excitation state ,",
    "we derive a compact expression for the normalization factor of pasv , which is an @xmath0-order legendre polynomial of the squeezing parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of added photons ; and then derive the explicit analytical expression of wf for any photon - added number @xmath0 and find the negative region of wf in phase space .",
    "we also show that there is an upper bound value of @xmath1 for this state to exhibit sub - poissonian statistics which increases as @xmath0 increases . in section 3",
    ", we derive the explicit analytical expression of time evolution of wf of the arbitrary pasv in the thermal channel and discuss the loss of nonclassicality in reference of the negativity of wf .",
    "the threshold value of the decay time corresponding to the transition of the wf from partial negative to completely positive definite is obtained at the center of the phase space , which is independent of the squeezing parameter .",
    "we show that the wf for single pasv has always negative value for all parameters @xmath1 if the decay time @xmath6(see eq.([4.16 ] ) below ) , where @xmath7 denotes the average thermal photon number in the environment * *  * * with dissipative coefficient * *  * * @xmath8 .",
    "conclusions are involved in the last section .",
    "various photon states have been generated by the micromaser and wfs of some cavity fields can be measured by a scheme based on interaction between cavity fields and atoms @xcite . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite when an excited atom passes through a cavity field which is in a squeezed vacuum state then their interaction may produce photon addition ( excitation ) on the squeezed vacuum state  the excited squeezed vacuum state .",
    "therectically , the single - mode pasv can be obtained by repeatedly operating the photon creation operator @xmath9  on a squeezed vacuum state @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is single mode vacuum , and @xmath13is the normalization constant to be determined , @xmath9 is the bose creation operator , and @xmath14 is the single - mode squeezing operator @xmath15 $ ] @xcite with @xmath1 being the squeezing parameter .      under the transform of @xmath16",
    "we see @xmath17 thus we can reform eq.([2.1 ] ) as@xmath18 on the other hand , using the operator identity @xcite@xmath19 where @xmath20 is @xmath0-order single variable hermite polynomial whose definition is @xmath21}\\frac{\\left (   -1\\right )   ^{l}m!}{l!(m-2l)!}\\left (   2x\\right )   ^{m-2l},\\ ] ] we have@xmath22 which indicates that the pasv is equivalent to a squeezed hermite - excited vacuum state .",
    "further using the generating function of @xmath20 , @xmath23 and eq.([2.4 ] ) , the normalization factor @xmath24 can be derived by @xmath25 where in the last step we have used the baker - hausdorff formula @xmath26 . using the newly found generating function of legendre polynomial @xcite ( see appendix a),@xmath27 we can derive the compact expression for @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath28 which is just the result in ref.@xcite derived by the mathematical induction method . in particular , when @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) i.e. , the single - photon added case , we see that @xmath31 is just a squeezed single - photon state ; on the other hand , for the single - photon subtracted case @xcite , the state is @xmath32 which indicates that adding a single - photon to the squeezed state has the same impact as annihilating a photon from the squeezed state . while for @xmath33 the case is not true ( also see fig.1 ) .",
    "for example , successive two - photon additions [ @xmath2 and successive two - photon subtractions [ @xmath3 will result in the same state produced by using subtraction - addition ( @xmath4 ) and addition - subtraction ( @xmath5 ) , respectively , i.e. , @xmath34 in ref.@xcite , two pssv is used to generate the squeezed superposition of coherent states with high fidelities and large amplitudes .    combining eqs.([2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) we can conveniently calculate the average photon number @xmath4 in pasv , @xmath35 where we denote @xmath36 for simplicity , and@xmath37 thus the mandel s @xmath38-parameter can be obtained by substituting eqs.([2.9 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) into @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , for single - photon - added case @xmath29 eqs.([2.9 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) reduce to @xmath40 thus the @xmath38-parameter with @xmath41 is given by@xmath42 from eq.([2.13 ] ) we find that @xmath38 becomes negative for @xmath41 which is satisfied for the squeezing parameter @xmath43 similar to the result of @xmath38 for single - photon subtracted case @xcite . in order to see clearly the variation of @xmath38-parameter with @xmath1 , we show the plots of @xmath38-parameter in fig.1 , from which one can clearly see that @xmath38-parameter  becomes negetive ( @xmath44 when @xmath1 is less than a certain threshold value which increases as @xmath0 increases ; while for @xmath45 @xmath38 is always positive .",
    "this implies that the nonclassicality is enhanced by adding photon to squeezed state .",
    "we should emphasize that the wf has negative region for all @xmath46 and thus the pasv is nonclassical . in our following work , we pay attention to the ( ideal ) pasv in a thermal channel .",
