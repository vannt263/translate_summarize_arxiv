    "prediction of the critical behavior of modified spin models in the presence of site or bond dilution , random bonds , random fields has been the subject of many studies in the last decades ; this modification brings about considerable changes in the critical behavior of these systems , such as replacement of a first - order phase transition ( fopt ) by a second - order phase transition ( sopt ) , depression of tricritical points and critical end points , new critical points and universality classes , etc @xcite .",
    "the study of the aforementioned disordered systems is based on the standard models , such as ising , blume - capel , baxter - wu , heisenberg , etc , modified accordingly to meet the requirements under consideration .",
    "furthermore , extensions and versions of these models can be applied to describe many other different situations , such as multicomponent fluids , ternary alloys , @xmath15he -@xmath16he mixtures , in addition to the magnetic systems for which these were initially conceived . the most extensively investigated model in statistical and condensed matter physics",
    "is the spin-1/2 ising model ( i m ) , since its two dimensional version , without an external magnetic field , was analytically solved by onsager ; it is a simple one relative to other models of cooperative phenomena and has a wide range of applicability to real physical systems .",
    "its three - dimensional version has not yet been solved exactly , for which the only existing results are either from the renormalization group calculations or series expansions and are thus considered to be the `` exact '' ones . in its modified versions , it exhibits a variety of multicritical phenomena , such as a phase diagram with ordered ferromagnetic and disordered paramagnetic phases separated by a transition line that changes from an sopt to an fopt joined at a tricritical point ( tcp ) ; besides these , critical points , critical end points , ordered critical points of various orders , re - entrance can appear as in the presence of random fields .",
    "the multicritical phenomena appear in systems presenting competition among distinct types of ordering and there are numerous circumstances in which this kind of phenomenon can arise . in ferromagnetic systems in the presence of random fields , the competition is between the parallel and random ordering , causing , occasionally , the conversion of a continuous transition into an fopt and the subsequent appearance of tcp as well as re - entrance in some cases @xcite .",
    "random field effects on magnetic systems have been systematically studied not only for their own theoretical study but for their experimental importance , as well .",
    "the methods used for the study of the i m are the mean field approximation ( mfa ) , high temperature expansions , series expansion , renormalization group , monte carlo , effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "the eldest one is the mfa , which is very popular because of its simplicity and has played an important role for the description of cooperative phenomena for many years ; it gives qualitative agreement with experimental results for many of the physical quantities involved in a phase transition .",
    "however , mfa has some unsatisfactory results in describing correctly the critical region because of the omission of correlations when its results are compared with those of experiments . mfa is still implemented because it is not complicated and can give a general view of the expected behavior for the system under consideration .",
    "many efforts were attempted towards improving mfa , such as the effective field theory by honmura and kaneyoshi @xcite .",
    "eft relies on introducing a differential operator into the exact spin correlation function identities obtained by callen @xcite and using the van der waerden spin identities , which improves substantially on the standard mfa @xcite .",
    "the eft approach is general and may be applied to systems with any spin value , adapting the van der waerden identities accordingly .",
    "this procedure presents a great versatility and has been applied to several occasions such as pure , site- and bond - random ising model , although this procedure shall not yield accurate values for the physical quantities in the critical region due to the absence of long range fluctuations .",
    "eft has already been used in numerous physical problems as a tool to study the magnetic behavior of complex spin systems , such as diluted ferromagnets @xcite , pure anisotropic systems @xcite , disordered systems @xcite , cylindrical nanowires @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we shall adopt is that of ising model with nearest neighbor interactions , in which the bond @xmath12 between two neighboring spins varies from pair to pair randomly ; the system is also under the influence of a random field @xmath4 , varying from site to site ; both random variables are drawn from a suitable probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the above system is    @xmath17    the summation in the first term extends over all nearest neighbors and is denoted by @xmath18 ; in the second term @xmath4 represents a random field that couples to the one dimensional spin variable @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian describes the competition between the long - range order ( expressed by the first summation ) and the random ordering fields .",
    "the presence of random fields requires two averaging procedures , the usual thermal average , denoted by angular brackets @xmath20 and disorder average over the random fields denoted by @xmath21 for the respective pdf s , which are usually a version of the bimodal or gaussian distributions .",
    "the random exchange integral @xmath12 between the sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 is drawn from the symmetric and anisotropic bimodal pdf ,    @xmath24    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the average value and standard deviation of @xmath12 , respectively , implying that the exchange integral is fluctuating .",
    "this choice of the pdf implies that both values ( @xmath25 ) of the random exchange integral are equally probable .",
    "the pdf for the random fields @xmath4 is also of the bimodal type    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath6 is the competition parameter and is considered to be positive so that the random fields are competitive .",
    "the site probability @xmath28 is the fraction of lattice sites having a random magnetic field with strength @xmath5 , while the rest sites have a field with strength @xmath29 with site probability@xmath30 such that @xmath3 and the usual choice was @xmath31 , symmetric case , @xcite . as far as the pdf ( [ bimodal ] ) is non symmetric , the mean value for @xmath4 does not vanish a priori , but , instead , is @xmath32 ;",
    "an immediate result is that the system is under the influence of a magnetic field in case @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one of the main issues was the experimental realization of random fields .",
    "fishman and aharony @xcite showed that the randomly quenched exchange interactions ising antiferromagnet in a uniform field @xmath35 is equivalent to a ferromagnet in a random field with the strength of the random field linearly proportional to the induced magnetization .",
    "this identification gave new impetus to the study of the rfim , the investigation gained further interest and was intensified resulting in a large number of publications ( theoretical , numerical , monte carlo simulations and experimental ) in the last thirty years . although much effort had been invested towards this direction , the only well - established conclusion drawn was the existence of a phase transition for @xmath36 ( d space dimension ) , that is , the critical lower dimension @xmath37 is 2 after a long controversial discussion @xcite , while many other issues are still unanswered ; among them is the order of the phase transition ( first or second order ) , the universality class and the dependence of these points on the form of the random field pdf.the study of rfim has also highlighted another feature of the model , that of tricriticality and its dependence on the assumed distribution function of the random fields . according to the mean field approximation , the choice of the random field distribution can lead to a continuous fm / pm boundary as in the single gaussian probability distribution , whereas for the bimodal one this boundary is divided into two parts , an sopt branch for high temperatures and an fopt branch for low temperatures separated by a tcp at @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite , where @xmath40 is the coordination number and @xmath41 the boltzmann constant , such that for @xmath42 and @xmath43 the transition to the fm phase is first order for the symmetric case @xmath44 .",
    "however , this behavior is not fully elucidated since in the case of the three - dimensional rfim , the high temperature series expansions by gofman et al @xcite yielded only continuous transitions for both probability distributions , whereas according to houghton et al @xcite both distributions predicted the existence of a tricritical point , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the bimodal and @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the single gaussian . in the monte carlo studies for @xmath49 , machta et al @xcite , using single gaussian distribution , could not reach a definite conclusion concerning the nature of the transition , since for some realizations of randomness the magnetization histogram was two - peaked ( implying an sopt ) whereas for other ones three - peaked , implying an fopt .    in this investigation , we study the eft applied to the random field spin-1/2 ising model on a square lattice with random bond nearest neighbor interactions , calculating the relevant thermodynamic quantities , such as critical temperatures , susceptibility , magnetization profiles with respect to the temperature @xmath14 and random field @xmath5 . the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the eft formalism is introduced and applied to the ising model in the presence of a random field and random bonds interactions ; the equation of state for the magnetization is derived . in section @xmath50 , the phase diagrams and magnetization profiles are calculated as functions of system s parameters ; we close with the conclusions in section @xmath51 .",
    "considering the hamiltonian ( [ rham ] ) , each spin is under the influence of a molecular field @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath40 is the coordination number . for the current model",

    "although the eft technique improves on the mfa , it presents the same shortcomings in the critical region ( non - classical region ) concerning the critical exponents like the mfa and landau theory , because the fluctuations occurring in the critical region , as the transition temperature is approached , become important and the non - classical behavior is observed ; these fluctuations are not taken under consideration properly by eft or mfa , thus a relative criterion , called ginzburg criterion , determines how close to the transition temperature the true critical behavior is revealed @xcite .",

    "however , on reducing the space dimension as in the case of the weak - coupling superconductor in two dimensions , the critical exponents have their classical values up to @xmath189 , thus the reduction of the space dimensionality causes serious repercussions on the behavior of the physical system ; on the contrary , for the superfluid helium transition the classical region extends up to @xmath190 so that fluctuations are detectable @xcite .",
    "in addition to superconductivity , the extent of the non classical region for the ferroelectric system triglycine sulfate ( tgs ) is relatively small and its critical exponents have the respective classical values up to @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in the current investigation by using the eft provide a basis for a comprehensive analysis by more sophisticated methods . however , they are of no less importance , since they show , nevertheless , the expected phenomena to be observed ."
