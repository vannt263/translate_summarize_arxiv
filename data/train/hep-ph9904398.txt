    "in both the large @xmath0 limit @xcite and the valence quark model @xcite , semileptonic heavy quark decays are saturated by resonant final states . in nature this idealization is broken by light quark pair creation which gives these infinitely narrow resonances widths and allows nonresonant final states to appear . while it is clear that @xmath2 pairs play an important role in this and many other phenomena , it is also clear that they remain poorly understood :    1 .",
    "although from their widths it is easy to show that hadrons are full of @xmath3 pairs , meson and baryon spectroscopies are characterized by the valence degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular there is no evidence for excitations of the @xmath3 sea with respect to the valence quarks . 2 .",
    "even if one were to assume that the @xmath3 sea is frozen out of spectroscopy , it is easy to show that , unless there is a conspiracy between them , meson loop graphs ought to destroy the successes of quark model spectroscopy .",
    "for example , the relative shift of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 due to meson loops formed from their dominant decay modes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) is hundreds of mev @xcite .",
    "related to 2 ) , but even more dramatic , is the relative shift of pairs of mesons such as the @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "they are degenerate in the quark model and in the large @xmath0 limit , as observed in nature , but meson loop diagrams would lead one to expect them to develop a mass difference of hundreds of mev @xcite .",
    "4 .   given that meson loop diagrams which generate the @xmath3 sea are very strong , it is surprising that the valence quarks seem to dominate low energy current matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the extreme interest generated by the proton spin crisis may be attributed to the fact that it indicates that there are some current matrix elements where the valence quarks do not dominate",
    ".    while the questions @xmath3 pair creation raises are ubiquitous , heavy quark systems ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are likely to be the most favorable systems in which to find answers : of all systems governed by strong qcd @xcite , they are arguably the simplest .",
    "indeed , many of their properties can be rigorously derived directly from qcd using heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "their simplicity also makes them more amenable to modelling than other hadrons .",
    "_ e.g. _ , as  the hydrogen atoms of qcd \" with the heavy quark defining an origin of coordinates , the simplest relativistic constituent quark models can treat @xmath11 systems using the dirac equation @xcite rather than a bethe - salpeter - type equation .",
    "because the heavy quark is removed from consideration as @xmath12 , such systems offer unique opportunities to study the  brown muck \" one chunk at a time .    in this paper",
    "i expand the quark model treatment of the  brown muck \" in heavy meson semileptonic decay from a simple valence @xmath13 or @xmath14 antiquark confined to @xmath15 to include the leading effects of @xmath2 pair creation .",
    "previous studies have examined low energy pion emission in the context of heavy quark chiral perturbation theory @xcite ; this work is the first of which i am aware to address the full array of nonresonant processes . while the results presented here will be specific to heavy quark systems",

    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are clearly dominant , accounting for more than @xmath20 of the inclusive @xmath21 semileptonic rate @xcite .",
    "for @xmath1 decays induced by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 account for @xmath25 of the inclusive @xmath26 semileptonic rate @xcite . given the large energy release in @xmath27 versus @xmath28 , it is not surprising that in the former the two ground state resonances of the @xmath29 multiplet @xcite would account for less of the total semileptonic rate .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite by assuming duality between the isgw2 valence quark model @xcite and qcd - corrected inclusive calculations @xcite that a _ complete _ isgw2-based calculation would predict that @xmath30 of the @xmath26 rate should go to resonant excited states above the @xmath16 and @xmath31 .",
    "( the quoted error corresponds to an estimate of the theoretical uncertainties in the qcd - corrected inclusive rate calculations . )",
    "isgw2 as published is in contrast not exhaustive : it explicitly computes the rates to the @xmath32 excited states with @xmath33 and @xmath34 and to the first radial excitations with @xmath35 .",
    "these six lowest - lying excitations give @xmath36 of the qcd - corrected inclusive rate , implying that an additional @xmath37 of the rate of a complete the isgw2 calculation should be in yet more highly excited states ( both ordinary mesons and hybrids ) . the isgw2 model and next - to - leading - order qcd",
    "can be compared in this way because both are valence - quark - plus - glue calculations : @xmath2 pairs are ignored in isgw2 as @xmath38 corrections and would enter the partonic level inclusive rates only at order @xmath39 ( _ via _ @xmath38-suppressed graphs ) .",

    "experimentally , the extent of resonance dominance of @xmath1 and @xmath16 semileptonic decays remains unclear . in @xmath16 decay",
    "there are explicit measurements giving @xmath41 rates which are @xmath42 of the semileptonic rate . here",
    "the @xmath43 signal is excluded from being the @xmath44 , but it is not excluded that it could arise from the tails of broad resonances , so even this small fraction can not be unambiguously identified as nonresonant . in @xmath1 decay , @xmath45 of the semileptonic rate is not in the @xmath16 or @xmath31 . since the dynamical part @xmath46 of the slope of the isgur - wise function @xmath47 could be as large as about @xmath48 @xcite , the _ loss _ of rate from these channels relative to @xmath49 in the approximation @xmath50",
    "could indeed be as large as @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the observed non-@xmath52 rate is not inconsistent with that expected from bjorken s sum rule @xcite in the heavy quark limit . since , as just explained , one expects @xmath30 of this non-@xmath52 rate to be in excited resonant states , there would be room for @xmath53 of @xmath1 semileptonic decays to be nonresonant , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a large fraction of @xmath54 to be due to nonresonant channels .",
    "there is another closely related indication that nonresonant channels might be significant : isgw2 overpredicts the @xmath16 and @xmath31 rates by amounts which are consistent with the observation that the isgur - wise function is falling about @xmath55 more rapidly than expected from the opening of just excited resonance decay channels . while suggestive , both of these observations are also consistent with the isgw2 model simply underpredicting decay rates to excited charm states @xcite .",
    "an additional concern is that the suggestive loss of rate from the @xmath16 and @xmath31 channels calculated from bjorken s sum rule is actually an upper bound in the heavy quark limit : expected quadratic terms in @xmath56 will dampen this loss , suggesting that perhaps the experimental non-@xmath52 fraction is high .    in summary ,",
    "there is weak circumstantial evidence for nonresonant processes in heavy quark semileptonic decays .",
    "the most compelling case for the existence of such processes at some level is nevertheless the simple theoretical observation that in the real world we expect very strong nonvalence @xmath57 components in a @xmath11 state and so expect some inclusive rate to be lost from resonances and transferred to continua . in",
    "what follows i will make these qualitative expectations , previously outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , concrete .",
    "in addition to providing a useful phenomenological guide to semileptonic decays , the isgw model @xcite was in many respects a stepping - stone to heavy quark symmetry , as it manifested this symmetry near zero recoil .",
    "isgw2 @xcite is an update of isgw with many new features required by heavy quark symmetry : it includes constraints on the relations between form factors away from zero recoil and on the slopes of form factors near zero recoil @xcite , it relates the naive currents of the quark model to the full weak currents _ via _ the matching conditions of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , and it modifies the _ ad hoc _ isgw prescription for connecting quark model form factors to physical form factors to be consistent with the constraints of heavy - quark - symmetry - breaking at order @xmath58 .",
    "several other improvements were also made , including the addition of heavy - quark - symmetry - breaking color magnetic interactions to the quark model s dynamics , the incorporation of relativistic corrections to the axial coupling constants ( known to be important in the analogous coupling @xmath59 in neutron beta decay ) , and the use of more realistic form factor shapes , based on the measured pion form factor .",
    "for a more complete discussion of the foundations , strengths , and weaknesses of such models , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "i focus on correcting these models neglect of the nonvalence components of hadrons , but note that many of the results to be described here are anticipated in the extensive discussion of ref . @xcite leading to the conclusion that nonresonant states could be ignored as a first approximation to the dynamics of semileptonic decays .",
    "some of the key puzzles associated with the nature and importance of @xmath2 pairs in low energy hadron structure were described above .",
    "these puzzles and potential solutions to them have been extensively discussed in a series of papers on  unquenching \" the quark model @xcite . in the following i",
    "briefly summarize these solutions , since they are the basis for the study presented here .      a central puzzle in hadron spectroscopy",
    "is the apparent absence of low energy degrees of freedom beyond those which can be attributed to the valence quarks ( _ e.g. _ , gluonic or sea quark excitations ) . very closely related to this puzzle",
    "is the apparent unimportance of strong meson loop corrections .",
    "a simple resolution of this puzzle has been proposed  @xcite . in the flux tube model",
    "@xcite , the quark potential model arises from an adiabatic approximation to the gluonic and extra @xmath2 degrees of freedom embodied in the flux tube .",
    "this physics has an analog at short distances where perturbation theory applies .",
    "there @xmath60 types of light @xmath2 pairs shift ( in lowest order ) the coefficient of the coulombic potential from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , the net effect of such pairs thus being to produce a _",
    "new _ effective short distance @xmath63 potential .",
    "similarly , when pairs bubble up in the flux tube ( _ i.e. _ , when the flux tube breaks to create a @xmath64 plus @xmath65 system and then  heals \" back to @xmath63 ) , their net effect is to cause a shift @xmath66 in the ground state gluonic energy which in turn produces a new long - range effective @xmath63 potential .",
    "it has indeed been shown  @xcite that the net long - distance effect of the bubbles is to create a new string tension @xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ , that the potential remains linear ) . since",
    "this string tension is to be associated with the observed string tension , after renormalization _ pair creation has no effect on the long - distance structure of the quark model in the adiabatic approximation_. thus the net effect of mass shifts from pair creation is much smaller than one would navely expect from the magnitude of typical hadronic widths : such shifts can only arise from nonadiabatic effects @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that no simple truncation of the set of all meson loop graphs can reproduce such results : to recover the adiabatic approximation requires summing over large towers of @xmath64 plus @xmath65 intermediate states to saturate their duality with @xmath2 loop diagrams which have strength at high energy .",
    "there is another puzzle of hadronic dynamics which is reminiscent of this one : the success of the ozi rule  @xcite . a generic ozi - violating amplitude @xmath68 can be shown to vanish like @xmath69 , and this is often quoted as a rationale for the ozi rule",
    ". however , there are several unsatisfactory features of this  solution \" to the ozi mixing problem  @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath8-@xmath70 mixing as an example .",
    "this mixing receives a contribution from the virtual hadronic loop process @xmath71 , both steps of which are ozi - allowed , and each of which scales with @xmath0 like @xmath72 .",
    "the large @xmath0 result that this ozi - violating amplitude behaves like @xmath73 is thus not peculiar to large @xmath0 : it just arises from  unitarity \" in the sense that the real and imaginary parts of a generic hadronic loop diagram will have the same dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the usual interpretation of the ozi rule in this case  -  -  -   that ",
    "double hairpin graphs \" are dramatically suppressed  -  -  -   is untenable in the light of these ozi - allowed loop diagrams .",
    "they expose the deficiency of the large @xmath0 argument since @xmath74 is _ not _ a good representation of the ozi rule .",
    "( continuing to use @xmath8-@xmath70 mixing as an example , we note that @xmath75 is numerically comparable to a typical hadronic width , so the large @xmath0 result would predict an @xmath8-@xmath70 mixing angle of order unity in contrast to the observed pattern of very weak mixing which implies that @xmath76 . )",
    "unquenching the quark model thus endangers the nave quark model s agreement with the ozi rule .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite how this disaster is naturally averted in the flux tube model through a  miraculous \" set of cancellations between mesonic loop diagrams consisting of apparently unrelated sets of mesons ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 loops tend to strongly cancel against loops containing a @xmath80 or @xmath81 plus one of the four strange mesons of the @xmath32 meson nonets ) .",
    "of course the  miracle \" occurs for a good reason : the sum of _ all _ hadronic loops is dual to a closed @xmath2 loop created and destroyed by a @xmath82 operator @xcite , but in the closure approximation such an operator can not create mixing in other than a scalar channel .",
    "it can also be shown @xcite that current matrix elements like @xmath83 vanish in this same approximation .",
    "the preceding discussion strongly suggests that models which have not addressed the effects of unquenching on spectroscopy and the ozi rule should be viewed very skeptically as models of the effects of the @xmath2 sea on hadron structure : large towers of mesonic loops are required to understand how quarkonium spectroscopy and the ozi rule survive once strong pair creation is turned on . in particular , while pion and kaon loops ( which tend to break the closure approximation due to their exceptional masses ) have a special role to play , they will not allow a satisfactory solution to these fundamental problems associated with unquenching the quark model and so can not be expected to provide a reliable guide to the physics of @xmath2 pairs .",
    "indeed , i hope the reader can appreciate just on the basis of this lightning review that there are great dangers in drawing conclusions about the strength , structure , or significance of @xmath2 pairs in hadrons from any model that has not dealt with these issues .",
    "to unquench predictions of the quark model for semileptonic heavy quark decay , i will apply without alteration the model of refs .",
    "@xcite which solves the phenomenological problems associated with unquenching the quark model .",
    "in particular , i assume that the @xmath2 pair is created by the action of a pair creation hamiltonian density @xmath84 in the @xmath11 flux tube .",
    "i further assume that the pair is created with a nonlocality ( corresponding to a finite constituent quark radius ) in the coordinate @xmath85 .",

    "note that the nonresonant rate is highly fragmented : none of the many channels tabulated account for more than @xmath343 of the inclusive nonresonant rate ( and thus no more than about @xmath344 of the total semileptonic rate )",
    ". these results are consistent with previous studies of single low energy pion emission using heavy quark chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "note also that the thirty final states considered here account for only about @xmath345 of the nonresonant rate , so that most of this rate resides in states @xmath346 composed of highly excited resonances .",
    "there are several reasons why the results given in table iii must be interpreted with caution .",
    "the most prominent is simply that they depend roughly on @xmath347 ! recalling that @xmath348 , our canonical value for @xmath201 is @xmath349 gev , but over the range of @xmath205 allowed by table ii , it varies from its canonical value by @xmath127 gev .",
    "although the factor @xmath350 makes this range narrower than that of @xmath205 itself , it still leaves us with an uncertainty of more than a factor of two on the basic unit for production of exclusive nonresonant channels .    the second word of caution concerns large corrections to the @xmath12 limit studied here which arise for real @xmath1 decay .",
    "the problem is phase space : in the heavy quark limit , all final states occur at the @xmath327 of the underlying quark production process , _ i.e. _ , the full mass range of the final state spectrum of states is negligible compared to the heavy quark energies even at low @xmath249 . in actual @xmath351 decays , each final state @xmath352 will have a dalitz plot that is a shrinking fraction of the @xmath353 dalitz plot as @xmath354 .",
    "thus in the heavy quark limit the loss of rate from the elastic channels @xmath355 would be _ locally compensated _ in the variable @xmath327 . for finite @xmath356 and @xmath357 , however , a loss of elastic rate will still occur _ via _",
    "@xmath239 , but the compensating channels will experience a delayed turn - on because of their thresholds ; indeed , some processes which would have helped to compensate @xmath239 will be kinematically forbidden .",
    "these phase space suppressions lead to @xmath358-type corrections to the inclusive rate , and therefore also corrections to the accuracy of quark - hadron duality .",
    "however , it is known on general grounds from heavy quark symmetry and the operator product expansion ( ope ) that , as the energy release @xmath359 , the leading corrections to the inclusive rate must be of order @xmath360 @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the ope has a radius of convergence which does not include the region in which ( significant ) hadronic thresholds are turning on , so for real @xmath27 transitions there can be @xmath358 corrections , and they can be substantial .",
    "however , associated with these @xmath358 threshold effects , which would diminish the integrated contribution of individual hadronic channels below the level required for perfect duality , are @xmath358 corrections to the rate for the production of such channels which _ enhance _ their production once they are above threshold .",
    "these counterbalancing effects soften the breaking of duality : they are the precursors of the perfect cancellation of @xmath358 effects that must occur as @xmath359",
    ".    how then should one make use of table iii for real @xmath27 transitions ?",
    "the amplitudes @xmath361 and @xmath362 shown are the leading order predictions for their respective channels . for the reasons just outlined",
    ", we can expect that they will be enhanced by @xmath358 corrections which are expected to be of the order of @xmath363 @xcite .",
    "however , despite this effect , i believe that the dramatically reduced size of their dalitz plots ( relative to that for the underlying quark process @xmath353 ) will reduce the actual population of all nonresonant states well below that expected from @xmath239 . indeed ,",
    "each channel shown in table iii has a continuous spectrum of masses from its threshold up to masses exceeding @xmath364 .",
    "consider , for example , the @xmath365 channel .",
    "its mass is given by @xmath366 , while its dominant @xmath16-wave production rate is proportional to @xmath367 , where @xmath368 gev .",
    "the production is therefore very weak at low masses where the available phase space is generous , and peaks at @xmath369 where it vanishes . given these basic kinematic facts , it is clear that even this simple exclusive channel will be produced at a rate far less than in the heavy quark limit , and that most of @xmath239 will be uncompensated .",
    "the third column of table iii gives the phase space factors by which individual channels will be reduced in real @xmath351 decays relative to the heavy quark limit ; the fourth column gives a very rough estimate for the _ net _ suppression of each channel as a product of this phase space factor and a generous guess that , after @xmath358 corrections , each channel has a compensatory increase of @xmath370 .",
    "considering that in general the untabulated channels of yet more highly excited states @xmath346 will suffer even greater phase space suppressions , an overall diminution of the nonresonant rate by at least a factor of four seems likely .",
    "although the successes of the valence quark model and the arguments of the large @xmath0 limit provide indications that sea quarks play a relatively minor role in hadronic physics , this hope is far from being justified by our current understanding .",
    "some failures of the quark model ( _ e.g. _ , the proton spin crisis ) and the known existence of strong real and virtual decay channel couplings indeed make blithely ignoring the role of @xmath2 pairs both phenomenologically and theoretically untenable . in this work",

    "the many @xmath2 pairs it generates remain in their adiabatically evolving ground state as the valence quarks move . in this work",
    "i have shown that the same approximation leads to valence quark and therefore resonance dominance of the simplest current matrix elements : @xmath371 matrix elements of heavy quark mesons .",

    "in particular , the experimental determination of the strength and structure of these nonresonant contributions would immediately test the conclusions reached here that these @xmath2 effects are highly suppressed in real @xmath27 decays , that such decays extend to very high masses , and that they are highly fragmented into many small channels .",
    "independent of the outcome , examining this problem in nature s simplest hadronic system under the action of its simplest current ( a heavy - to - heavy nonsinglet transition ) should prove to be an excellent starting point for eventually understanding the @xmath2 sea in all strongly interacting matter .",
