    "taking advantage of the astrophysical framework , directional detection of dark matter is an interesting strategy in order to distinguish wimp events from background ones @xcite . indeed , like most spiral galaxies , the milky way is supposed to be immersed in a halo of wimps which outweighs the luminous component by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "as the solar system rotates around the galactic center through this dark matter halo , wimps should mainly come from the direction to which points the sun velocity vector and which happens to be roughly in the direction of the cygnus constellation ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , we argue that a clear and unambigous signature of a dark matter detection could be done by showing the correlation of the measured signal with the direction of the solar motion .",
    "+ several project of directional detectors are being developed @xcite and some of them are already taking data @xcite .",
    "the first step when analysing directional data should be to look for a signal pointing toward the cygnus constellation with a sufficiently high significance @xcite .",
    "if no evidence in favor of a galactic origin of the signal is deduced from the previous analysis , then an exclusion limit should be derived @xcite . on figure",
    "[ fig : discovery ] we present the projected discovery regions and exclusion limits for a forthcoming directional detector proposed by the mimac collaboration .",
    "we consider a 10 kg @xmath1 detector operated during @xmath2 years , allowing 3d track reconstruction , with a @xmath3 angular resolution , a recoil energy range 5 - 50 kev and with a conservative background rate of 10 evts / kg / year . from figure",
    "[ fig : discovery ] , two different scenarii may be distinguished :    * the dark and light - grey shaded areas represent the contours where a directional detection of dark matter would have a significance greater than 3@xmath4 and 5@xmath4 . these contours are deduced from the map - based likelihood method @xcite . as an illustration ,",
    "if the wimp - nucleon cross - section is about @xmath5 pb with a wimp mass of 100 gev.c@xmath6 , the detector would have a dark matter detection with a significance greater than 3@xmath4 .",
    "* if the wimp - nucleon cross - section is lower than @xmath7 pb , then an exclusion limit is deduced using the extended likelihood method ( black dashed line ) presented in @xcite . as a benchmark and to illustrate the effect of background on exclusion limits , the detector sensitivity ( no event ) is presented ( black solid line ) .",
    "figure [ fig : discovery ] also presents exclusion limits from direct detection experiments , kims  @xcite and picasso  @xcite as well as the theoretical region , obtained within the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model taken from @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that a directional detector like mimac will cover an important region of interest worth being investigated .",
    "exclusion limits from some direct detection experiments are presented , kims  @xcite and picasso  @xcite as well as the theoretical region , obtained within the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model from @xcite .",
    "contours corresponding to a significance greater than 3@xmath4 and 5@xmath4 are presented in dark and light grey .",
    "the exclusion limit corresponding to pure background data is presented as the black dashed line and the detector sensitivity as the black solid line . ]",
    "constraining dark matter parameters both from particle physics ( mass @xmath8 and cross section @xmath9 ) and galactic halo ( wimp velocity distribution ) with upcoming dark matter experiments is a main concern of current phenomenological studies . in the context of upcoming experiments which might give wimp positive detection ( @xmath10 pb ) instead of background rejection , it is of particular interest to develop a model - independent formalism to constrain dark matter properties .",
    "a new approach has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to constrain dark matter properties using a high dimensional multivariate analysis within the framework of a general halo model .",
    "this strategy is referred to as _ quasi model - independent _ method as all parameters are constrained directly from the data of a single experiment .",
    "+ indeed , directional detection presents a high identification potential thanks to the combined measurement of the recoil energy @xmath11 and the recoil direction ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it allows to achieve multivariate analysis in order to obviate systematic bias in the determination of the wimp properties , due to wrong halo model assumptions  @xcite .",
    "within the framework of a quasi model - independent method and by using a markov chain monte carlo analysis of recoil events , we show for the first time the possibility to contrain the wimp properties , both from particle physics ( @xmath13 ) and galactic dark matter halo physics ( velocity dispersions ) .",
    "this leads to an identification of non - baryonic dark matter , which could be reached within few years by upcoming directional detectors @xcite .",
    "directional detection depends crucially on the wimp velocity distribution . the isothermal sphere halo model is often considered but it is worth going beyond this standard paradigm in the case of a model - independent analysis .",
    "indeed , recent results from n - body simulations are in favor of triaxial dark matter halos with anisotropic velocity distributions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent observations of sagittarius stellar tidal stream have shown evidence for a triaxial milky way dark matter halo @xcite",
    ".    the multivariate gaussian wimp velocity distribution @xcite corresponds to the generalization of the standard isothermal sphere with a density profile @xmath14 , leading to a smooth wimp velocity distribution , a flat rotation curve and no substructure .",
    "the wimp velocity distribution in the laboratory frame is given by , @xmath15}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] is the velocity dispersion tensor assumed to be diagonal in the galactic rest frame ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 is the sun motion with respect to the galactic rest frame .",
    "when neglecting the sun peculiar velocity and the earth orbital velocity about the sun , @xmath20 corresponds to the detector velocity in the galactic rest frame and is taken to be @xmath21 km.s@xmath22 along the @xmath18 axis pointing toward the cygnus constellation at ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the velocity anisotropy @xmath25 , is then defined @xcite as @xmath26 according to n - body simulations , the @xmath27 parameter at the solar radius spans the range @xmath28 , corresponding to radial anistropy .",
    "+ in the following , the input halo model used to generate simulated data , is chosen according to two models : a standard isotropic halo ( @xmath29 ) in which case the velocity dispersions are related to the local circular velocity @xmath30 km / s as @xmath31 ; and an extremely anisotropic halo ( @xmath32 ) , with the following velocity dispersions @xmath33 km / s ; @xmath34 km / s ; @xmath35 km / s@xmath36 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the logarithmic ellipsoidal halo model from @xcite with the sun located on the major axis of the halo with the axis ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 equal to 0.9 and 0.8 respectively .",

    "finally , @xmath46 is the three - dimensional radon transform of the wimp velocity distribution @xmath47 .",

    "we have considered flat prior for each parameter . in such case ,",

    "@xmath56 refers to the energy and direction of each event while the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the directional rate of the wimp and the background events respectively .",
    "this mcmc analysis is based on the metropolis - hastings algorithm , using chain subsampling according to the burn - in and correlation lengths to deal only with independent samples @xcite .",
    "we first applied this mcmc method on a benchmark model with the following characteristics  : isotropic halo model ( @xmath29 ) with a sizeable background contamination ( @xmath59 ) , a @xmath60 wimp and a wimp - nucleon axial cross section @xmath61 pb , well below current exclusion limits , see figure [ fig : discovery ] .",
    "the input model is used to generate simulated data considering a mimac like detector as described above .",
    "these data are then analysed with the directional mcmc method .",
    "the full mcmc result with 2d correlations may be found in @xcite .",
    "however , major results are shown on table  [ tab : modelinputdark ] and the conclusion is threefold :    * the discovery proof is given by the reconstruction of the main incoming direction @xmath62 pointing toward the cygnus constellation within 2.5@xmath63 , which is in favor of a positive dark matter detection . * the three velocity dispersions are strongly and consistently constrained according the input values corresponding to an isothermal sphere . moreover , using equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) , we can evaluate the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of the velocity anisotropy parameter ( @xmath27 ) which is in favor of an isotropic halo ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "* as the galactic dark matter halo properties are well constrained , constraints on the wimp properties ( @xmath65 ) are also strong and consitent according to the input wimp parameters : ( @xmath66 gev / c@xmath67 , @xmath68 pb ) .    as a conclusion of this benchmark study , we can deduce that this mcmc analysis , combined with directional data , is very well suited to constrain dark matter properties in a quasi model - independent way .",

    "however , in this section we will briefly discuss the effect of some of the input parameters on the different constraints in order to estimate the performance of this analysis tool .",
    "we will first focus on the impact of the input wimp mass . to do so ,",
    "we have simulated three different sets of directional data corresponding to an input wimp mass of @xmath86 with a constant wimp - nucleon cross - section @xmath87 and the standard isotropic halo model .",
    "the results from the three mcmc runs are illustrated on figure [ fig : wimpmass ] .",
    "we present for the three wimp masses , on the left panel , the 68% and 95% cl contours in the ( @xmath88 ) plan and on the right panel , the posterior pdf @xmath89 of the anisotropy velocity parameter @xmath27 .",
    "+ it can be deduced from figure  [ fig : wimpmass ] that the constraints strongly depend on the input wimp mass , but in each case , the constraints are consistent with the input values .",
    "then , this analysis has been shown to be working for any input wimp mass although the constraints are stronger for light wimps .",
    "this is due to the fact that the signal characteristics , _",
    "i.e _ the slope of the energy distribution and the width of the angular distribution , evolve slowly with the wimp mass once @xmath90 gev / c@xmath67 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "+ in the following , we investigate the effect of an extremely triaxial halo model with @xmath91 on the estimation of the dark matter parameters ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the results from the mcmc run on a simulated dataset corresponding to a wimp mass of 50 gev / c@xmath67 with the anisotropic halo model are presented on figure [ fig : halot4 ] .",
    "as previously , on the left panel is presented the constraint at 68% and 95% on the ( @xmath88 ) plan while on the right panel is given the deduced posterior pdf of the @xmath27 parameter . for convenience and comparison ,",
    "the results from the benchmark input model ( isothermal sphere with a 50 gev / c@xmath67 wimp ) are recalled .",
    "+ from the left panel of figure [ fig : halot4 ] , we can conclude that the two halo models give similar constraints which are both consistent with the input values .",
    "in fact , and as foreseen , the fact that the velocity dispersions are set as free parameters in the mcmc analysis allows to avoid induced bias due to wrong model assumption .",
    "from the right panel of figure [ fig : halot4 ] we can deduce that the @xmath27 parameter is well constrained : @xmath93 and strongly in favor of an anisotropic dark matter halo .",
    "+ as a conclusion of this study , it should be highlighted that the combination of information from the angular and energy distributions leads to robust allowed regions in the ( @xmath88 ) plan , since the halo model is also being constrained with the mcmc analysis from the same dataset of a single directional detection experiment .",
    "moreover , the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ the three velocity dispersions , could be sufficiently constrained to discriminate between different halo models with future directional detectors such as the one proposed by the mimac collaboration @xcite .",
    "the mimac prototype is the elementary chamber of the future large matrix .",
    "it allows the possibility to show the ionization and track measurement performance needed to achieve the directional detection strategy .",
    "the primary electron - ion pairs produced by a nuclear recoil in one chamber of the matrix are detected by drifting the electrons to the grid of a bulk micromegas @xcite and producing the avalanche in a very thin gap ( 128 or 256@xmath94 m ) .",
    "the electrons move towards the grid in the drift space and are projected on the anode thus allowing to get information on x and y coordinates . to access the x and y dimensions with a 100 @xmath94 m spatial resolution , a bulk micromegas with a 4 by 4 cm@xmath67 active area , segmented in pixels with a pitch of 350 @xmath94 m",
    "is used as 2d readout . in order to reconstruct the third dimension z of the recoil",
    ", a self - triggered electronics has been developed .",
    "it allows to perform the anode sampling at a frequency of 40 mhz .",
    "this includes a dedicated 16 channels asic @xcite associated to a daq @xcite .",
    "the total recoil energy is deduced from the measured ionization quenching factor ( iqf ) @xcite .",
    "+ in order to fully exploit the data from the mimac detector and to constrain dark matter properties , the recoiling tracks have to be accurately reconstructed : direction , sense and position in the detector volume . to achieve this goal",
    ", we first developed a track simulation software using srim @xcite ( simulated tracks ) , magboltz @xcite ( electron drift velocity and dispersions ) combined with the detector response simulation ( mimac daq ) .",
    "this way , we can simulate any kind of recoiling track according to the following input parameters : x , y , z , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the sense @xmath98 ( upward or downward ) .",
    "each track is characterized by three types of topological observables : number of slices , position of the center of gravity @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the collected charge for each slice and the width @xmath101 and @xmath102 along x and y of each slice .",
    "hence , the number of topological observables associated to any recoil track is given by : @xmath103 in this paper , we present a new mimac data analysis , based on @xcite , in order to recover the track parameters : \\{x , y , z , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98}. as a working example , we will consider in the following a simulated track of an hydrogen recoil of 100 kev at the position \\{x = 0 , y = 0 , z = 5 } cm , in the direction \\{@xmath104 , @xmath105 } and going downward .",
    "the analysis is based on the computation of the likelihood function @xmath106 defined as , @xmath107 where the different probability @xmath108 are estimated using a frequentist approach by simulating a large number of tracks for each step in the parameter space .",
    "[ tab : modelinputtrack ]    llllll & x [ cm ] & y [ cm ] & z [ cm ] & @xmath96 [ @xmath63 ] & @xmath97 [ @xmath63 ] + input & 0 & 0 & 5 & 45 & 0 + output & @xmath110 & @xmath111 & @xmath112 & @xmath113 & @xmath114 +    in order to compute the likelihood function , we used a markov chain monte carlo algorithm and the full mcmc result following the \\{@xmath115 downward } hypothesis is given in @xcite .",
    "deduced constraints on the five parameters and comparison with their input values are described in table  [ tab : modelinputtrack ] . from this single track analysis",
    "it can be deduced that the spatial uncertainty is of the order of 100 @xmath94 m for x and y and about 2 mm for the absolute height z ; and the angular uncertainty is about 3@xmath116 . however , even if systematic studies are needed to accurately estimate the different resolutions , results from table [ tab : modelinputtrack ] are strongly in favor of accurately reconstructed tracks .",
    "+ so far , we did not discuss the possibility to discriminate between the two hypothesis : downward or upward , the so - called `` head - tail effect '' .",
    "to do so with our track reconstruction method , we compute the likelihood function according to the second hypothesis \\{@xmath117 upward}. then , a direct comparison of the maximum log - likelihood values of each hypothesis ( -3.8 for \\{@xmath117 downward } and -5.1 for \\{@xmath117 upward } ) allows to conclude in favor of a downwarding track consistent with the input simulated track .",
    "hence , this method seems to be able to achieve the sense recognition of the recoiling tracks , but here again , systematic studies must be done to estimate its efficiency @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the directional detector proposed by the mimac collaboration should be sensitive to an important region of interest of the dark matter parameter space ( @xmath40 , @xmath9 ) motivated by constrained minimal supersymmetric models . in the case of a strong wimp positive detection with @xmath10 pb , an identification of dark matter could be achieve in a model independent way using the mcmc analysis method presented in section 2 .",
    "we have shown that constraining the velocity dispersions of the galactic dark matter halo allows to obviate bias in the determination of the wimp properties , due to wrong halo model assumptions . moreover , we have shown the possibility to discriminate between various halo model characterized by their velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "however , such interesting results requires accurate track reconstruction : direction , position and sense . to reach this goal",
    ", we developed a new track reconstruction method based on a likelihood analysis which has shown very promising results , _",
    "i.e _ high resolutions .",
    "although , systematic studies must be done to accurately estimate the differents resolutions and the sense recognition efficiency .",
