    "here we explore the static potential of the hybrid three - body system composed of a gluon , a quark and an antiquark using lattice qcd methods .",
    "the wilson loop method was deviced to extract from pure - gauge qcd the static potential for constituent quarks and to provide detailed information on the confinement in qcd . in what concerns",

    "our study of hybrids continues the lattice qcd mapping of the static potentials for exotic hadrons .",
    "the interest in hybrid three - body gluon - quark - antiquark systems is increasing in anticipation to the future experiments besiii at ihep in beijin , gluex at jlab and panda at gsi in darmstadt , dedicated to study the mass range of the charmonium , with a focus in its plausible hybrid excitations .",
    "moreover , several evidences of a gluon effective mass of 600 - 1000 mev from the lattice qcd gluon propagator in landau gauge , @xcite , from schwinger - dyson and bogoliubov - valatin solutions for the gluon propagator in landau gauge @xcite , from the analogy of confinement in qcd to supercondutivity @xcite , from the lattice qcd breaking of the adjoint string @xcite , from the lattice qcd gluonic excitations of the fundamental string @xcite from constituent gluon models @xcite compatible with the lattice qcd glueball spectra @xcite , and with the pomeron trajectory for high energy scattering @xcite may be suggesting that the static interaction for gluons is relevant .",
    "importantly , an open question has been residing in the potential for hybrid system , where the gluon is a colour octet , and where the quark and antiquark are combined to produce a second colour octet .",
    "while the constituent quark ( antiquark ) is usually assumed to couple to a fundamental string , in constituent gluon models the constituent gluon is usually assumed to couple to an adjoint string .",
    "notice that in lattice qcd , using the adjoint representation of su(3 ) , bali @xcite found that the adjoint string is compatible with the casimir scaling , were the casimir invariant @xmath3 produces a factor of @xmath4 from the @xmath5 interaction to the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "thus we already know that the string tension , or energy per unit lenght , of the adjoint string is @xmath7 times larger than the sum of the string tension of two fundamental strings . how can these two pictures , of one adjoint string and of two fundamental strings , with different total string tensions , match ?",
    "this question is also related to the superconductivity model for confinement , is qcd similar to a type - i or type - ii superconductor ?",
    "notice that in type type - ii superconductors the flux tubes repel each other while in type - i superconductors they attract each other and tend to fuse in excited vortices .",

    "in principle any wilson loop with a geometry similar to the one in fig . [ wilson orlando ] and describing correctly the quantum numbers of the hybrid is adequate , although the signal to noise ratio may depend in the choice of the wilson loop .",
    "a correct wilson loop must include a su(3 ) octet , the gluon , a su(3 ) triplet , the quark and a su(3 ) anti - triplet , the antiquark .",

    "this can be interpreted with a type - ii superconductor analogy for the confinement in qcd , with repulsion of the fundamental strings and with the string tension of the first topological excitation of the string ( the adjoint string ) larger than the double of the fundamental string tension .",
    "nevertheless , because the energy of two fundamental strings plus the repulsive energy measured here is quite similar to the energy of the adjoint string measured by bali @xcite , this shows that the pure gauge qcd is similar to a type - ii superconductor quite close to the phase transition to a type - i superconductor .",
    "our results are important for constituent models for hybrids and glueballs . in the three - body hybrid , with one quark , one antiquark and one gluon",
    ", our results suggest that the best potential model has only two fundamental strings , plus a repulsion acting only when the two fundamental strings are close . in the two body gluon - gluon glueball",
    ", our results suggest that the string tension is similar to the one of the casimir scaling model , with a factor of the order of @xmath61 when compared with the quark - antiquark potential",
    ". we can also extrapolate our result for three - body glueballs , relevant for the odderon problem . with three gluons , a triangle formed by three fundamental strings costs less energy than three adjoint strings with a starfish - like geometry .",
    "thus we anticipate that the three - gluon potential is similar to a sum of three mesonic quark - antiquark interactions , plus a repulsion acting only when there is superposition of the fundamental strings .",
