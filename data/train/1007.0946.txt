    "more than a year and half ago the ` large hadron collider ' ( lhc ) , came into limelight , due to the spectacular show of its start up , the equally spectacular accident soon after and also for the doomsday stories that circulated around its start up .",
    "the accident put it out of action for a while . now",
    "the necessary repairs done , the damaged pieces replaced , the machine has taken the first tentative steps in its life beginning on november 23 , 2009 .",
    "having set a world record for the proton beam energy , of 1180 gev , on november 30 , 2009 , it went back to the lower beam energy of @xmath0 gev per beam and ran for about two weeks in the collision mode .",
    "the detectors collected data , corresponding to a few hundred thousand @xmath1 collision events , over this period confirming that their intricate machinery performed as it should and can measure the properties of the myriad of particles produced in these collisions , to the desired accuracy .",
    "after a winter shut down ( partially caused by the escalation in energy costs due to the increased energy demands otherwise in winter ) the machine started working again on 20 th february 2010 .",
    "after circulating proton beams at the higher energy of 3.5 tev since 19th march 2010 , finally collisions at the total centre of mass energy of 7 tev happened on the 30th march 2010 ; albeit this was still only half the originally planned energy and with 10 times less number of particles per bunch than initially foreseen for the restart . the decision to do",
    "so being taken , in the words of cern director general , rolf heuer , as a ` prudent step by step approach ' as ` the lhc is not a turnkey project ' .",
    "papers , presenting results from the december runs have already been published in research journals  @xcite and more have been submitted already from the collisions in march  @xcite , with thousands of authors signing them .",
    "particle physicists : experimentalists and theorists alike , are waiting now with baited breath , just as they have been for more than a decade now , for the results which will come out of these collisions .",
    "i write these lines from cern , where even in the cafeteria now the television screens display information about the lhc machine operation !    while the rest of the world came to know of this extremely complicated endeavor only about a year and half ago , for the worldwide community of particle physicists ( which incidentally developed the world wide web ( www ) two decades ago ) , this is perhaps the concluding chapter of the long running love story between the world of fundamental constituents of matter and that of the accelerators which get these particles to move at the speed of light . in this article",
    "i discuss why thousands of particle physicists the world over , together , have embarked upon this truly mammoth project and worked on it over three decades .",
    "i wish to highlight what we all hope to learn from doing experiments with this unique machine .",
    "the construction of this accelerator and that of the equally huge and complex detectors , by itself , has been an amazing and utterly impressive engineering achievement . to appreciate the scope of this achievement by accelerator physicists and engineers , from cern and the rest of the world , including india",
    ", we should follow a story which began perhaps a century ago .",
    "it is also a story of a development of a methodology of the",
    " mega science projects that the high energy physicists have developed .",
    "the development of our knowledge of the laws of physics that function at the heart of the matter has been very closely interlinked with that of the accelerators .",
    "it may be said that the discovery of the first fundamental particle , the electron , by j.j .",
    "thompson in 1897 was due to the first ` accelerator : a cathode ray tube ' , which accelerated electrons .",
    "the partnership between accelerators and particle physicists on this adventure has continued through the century .",
    "the legendary physicist lord rutherford , who discovered existence of a nucleus inside an atom using the alpha particles emitted by the radioactive nuclei , had said , dreaming about high energy particles to uncover nature s secret `` it has long been my ambition to have available a copious supply of atoms and electrons which have energies transcending those of the alpha , beta particles from the radioactive bodies '' .",
    "his dream was full filled by walton and cockroft in the cavendish laboratory .",
    "the target of energy ( mev : million electron volt ) to which the particles needed to be accelerated , was set by gamow s theory of radioactive decay .",
    "this gave the height of coulomb barrier to @xmath2 emission in a nucleus and hence indicated the energy level to which particles need to be accelerated for possible artificial radioactivity : the aim of rutherford s experiments at that time .",
    "since then the nuclear / particle physicists have been setting the bar higher and higher and accelerator physicists have been clearing it with regularity , like sergey bubka or yelena isinbayeva .",
    "compared to the early machine by walton and cockroft which fitted in a room or the early cyclotron by lawrence and livingstone which was only 11 inches in diameter , today s machines are truly gigantic .",
    "further , the energies to which these machines accelerate the particles are higher by many orders of magnitude . the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) in batavia in usa , held the record for accelerating protons to about a thousand times its rest mass energy @xmath3 1000 gev or 1 tev , corresponding to a total collision energy of 2000 gev ; a feat that the lhc eclipsed by first reaching a total collision energy of 2360 gev and then 7000 gev , as said before .",
    "acceleration of particles to these high energies is not achieved by the use of electrostatic force alone , but has to be by a judicious combination of the alternating electric fields and magnetic fields as is done in the more sophisticated cyclotron .",
    "first model , costing only us $ 25 in 1931 , used 2000 volts of electricity but produced protons with energy 80,000 electron volts .",
    "magnetic fields are not only required to facilitate this acceleration of particles , but later also to keep them on a tight leash and steer the beam around its path as a tight bunch , without allowing them to spread apart .",
    "all this beam optics requires careful designing of magnetic fields , with very precise spatial distribution .",
    "thus an accelerator physicist has to deliver a beam of particles accelerated to speeds close to that of light ] , containing a large number of particles ( @xmath4 or more for the lhc at the nominal design ) and with a small transverse size ( a few @xmath5 at the collision point for the lhc ) .",
    "the beam has to maintain this size while the particles are transported across the long periphery of the machine ( @xmath6 for the lhc ring ) , many times ( @xmath7 ) over .",
    "clearly this whole exercise poses extreme technological challenges and requires fine engineering .",
    "the decisions about the type of particles which should collide and the energies to which they should be accelerated , are guided crucially by our current theoretical understanding of fundamental particles and the interactions among them .",
    "this interplay of different sub - disciplines in the field of high energy physics is seen in the citation of the 1984 nobel prize for physics which was shared by the experimental physicist carlo rubbia and the accelerator physicist simon van der meer  for their decisive contributions to the large project , which led to the discovery of the field particles w and z , communicators of weak interaction \" . the large project mentioned in",
    "the citation was the super proton - antiproton synchrotron : the @xmath8 which started operation at cern in geneva , switzerland in 1983 .",
    "this project involved converting the proton - proton collider which had been commissioned in 1976 , into a proton - antiproton collider . the need to do so was indicated by theorists calculations which showed that given the limited energy to which the proton could be accelerated using the then available technology , the feat of producing the @xmath9 bosons in the laboratory , could be achieved only if one collided protons on _ antiprotons _ and that too in large numbers .",
    "this prediction was made using the then established glashow - weinberg - salam model ( put forward in 1968 ) which gave a unified description of the electromagnetic and weak interactions and with the knowledge of the momentum fraction of the proton carried by some of its constituents , the quarks and the anti quarks .",
    "simon van der meer s discovery of ` stochastic cooling ' made it possible to produce tightly focused antiproton beams whereas rubbia s vision and drive made it possible for the project to be realised .",
    "already this little discussion tells a lot of things about the current state of play in high energy physics , including the need for ` project ' leaders to take these big projects from conception to realisation and the very high level of collaboration necessary , not just among the large number of experimentalists working together on one single experiment , not just among them and the theorists , but also among these two groups and the accelerator physicists .",
    "the particle physics community has been grappling for decades and with reasonable success , with running these mammoth collaborative projects and at the same time keep individuality , the basis of all progress , alive !    in this narration , i will first try to explain why lhc : the machine and the experiments with it , are a watershed for particle physics .",
    "i will then sketch the essential link between the development of particle accelerators and that in our knowledge of the laws governing the interactions among the fundamental particles , showing how this journey has reached destination lhc .",
    "after this i briefly describe how the high energy physics experiments of past few decades have provided important pointers to the physicists who are hunting for the higgs boson and other new particles / physics at the lhc .",
    "this discussion will then help us understand how the decisions for the lhc design ; the energy and number of particles in the beam , were arrived at .",
    "i will then end by telling about the lhc physics agenda and the time line in which the particle physicists hope to achieve it .",
    "as we go along we will try to understand , why particle physicists believe that , at least one , as yet undiscovered particle , must exist out there and the lhc will see it .",
    "independent of whether this turns out to be the higgs boson with the properties predicted by the corresponding theory , we also expect existence of even more particles / interactions which lhc will be in a good position to find should they exist .",
    "one thing is for sure .",
    "lhc : the machine and the experiment , is going to be a watershed for the subject of fundamental particle physics",
    ". particle physics will never be the same , independent of what the experiments find .",
    "lhc is now the doorstep and the day of reckoning at hand .",
    "we expect the lhc to find the last missing piece of the standard model , the higgs boson .",
    "we expect much more .",
    "we believe lhc will also point the way ahead ( or even to a dead end ? ) , help unravel the deepest secrets of nature and space time .",
    "hence it is a watershed experiment .    to appreciate why this is so",
    ", it is important to understand the current state of play in the subject . the normal course through which science progresses is well known to all of us . barring the work of geniuses like einstein ,",
    "normally , existing theory and observed phenomena which are unexplained in the framework of that theory , lead to new theoretical developments .",
    "this then leads to predictions , which then get tested in experiments .",
    "however , in the subject of high energy physics ( hep ) one is in a very strange situation .",
    "we have a theory , called standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , which works so well that there seems to be almost no unexplained phenomena.(see box - i , for some details of the sm . )",
    "various new theoretical developments have taken place only by the demands made by the community on the properties that the mathematical theory aught to have for it to be a satisfactory description of the fundamental interactions .",
    "one example of a very simple demand is called unitarity : which very simplistically stated means that probabilities for different events are bounded by unity , as they always must be .",
    "some of the theoretical developments beyond the sm ( bsm ) have also come by demanding that some features , such as the values of the masses that different particles have , should be understood from first principles in the theory .",
    "for example , in the sm , we have such a first principle understanding why the rest mass of the photon is zero . all the efforts to find _ direct _ proof for any of these new ideas (",
    "supersymmetry , additional compact dimensions of space@xcite to name a few ) , in the various particle physics experiments and/or to look for their implications in cosmology / astrophysical situations , have yielded , so far , negative results . in other words , we seem to have found a ` perfect ' theoretical description of fundamental constituents of all the matter and interactions among them , barring a ` direct ' verification of one last ` piece ' of the puzzle , the higgs boson .    on the one hand , the particle physics community has strong theoretical reasons that there is new physics at the tev scale , while on the other , the experimental evidence for its ` need ' is only in the form of tantalising ` indications ' such as non - zero masses for the neutrinos , or the dark - matter in the universe etc .",
    "it should be emphasized here , that the track record of particle physicists is pretty good so far in this context and theoretical developments based on demands of aesthetics alone have been fruitful at getting at the root of some of the very fundamental questions about laws of nature .",
    "but , admittedly , the time gap between theory and experiment has never been so big as it is at present .",
    "we are still awaiting the final experimental verification of a theoretical advancement made in 1964 .",
    "one direction in which progress can come is by increasing the available energy at which particle interactions are studied .",
    "there are solid reasons to believe that experiments at an energy of the order of a few terra electron volts ( tev ) would bring further progress .",
    "the hep community expects the three tev colliders ( the @xmath10 tevatron in usa , the @xmath1 collider lhc which has started its journey now and the international linear electron - positron collider ( ilc ) which is now under planning ) to help us see the way ahead .",
    "due to the higher energy of the lhc than the tevatron , at present all the particle physicists look to the lhc to provide the final clinching evidence for the sm and give at least a glimpse of the physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) , which all of them believe , must exist at around the tev scale .",
    "very interestingly the fundamental laws of particle interactions operating at the ` heart of the matter ' at ` femto ' meter scales ( or smaller ) that the particle physicists have been studying , have implications for issues cosmological in nature , concerning the universe , as it was at the beginning and what it is now .",
    "the formation of protons / neutrons in the early universe ( nucleosynthesis ) , the observed abundances of various elements such as @xmath11 etc . in the universe , can now be understood in terms of known physics of these interactions and experiments performed in terrestrial environment and laboratories .",
    "however , it is clear now that there are some very basic features of our universe that seem to indicate existence of particles outside the list given in the tables 1 and 2 of box - i . among these",
    "are the following facts : 1 ) the fundamental particles listed in the tables 1,2 of box - i constitute only @xmath12 of the total visible matter in the universe and @xmath13 of the matter in the universe that is is ` invisible'(so called dark matter , dm ) does not consist of particles of the sm , 2)among the particle content of the universe , we see only matter particles and virtually no antimatter particles . to be precise the difference between the number of baryons and anti - baryons normalised to the total number of photons , @xmath14 , and 3)the universe seems to be continuously accelerating .",
    "the source of this acceleration is again not found among the known matter / interactions and seems to indicate an unknown form of ` energy ' ( hence called dark energy ) which forms about @xmath15 of the total mass / energy content of the universe .",
    "all these indicate very clearly existence of physics beyond what is in the sm .",
    "what is even more interesting is that possible candidates which can throw light and/or provide solution to these issues , also exist very ` naturally ' in almost all the ideas of bsm physics that particle physicists have putting forward forward for an entirely different reason , viz .",
    ", to remove some of the theoretical shortcomings of the currently accepted description of the sm .",
    "but no one idea separates itself completely from the crowd .",
    "experiments are the ultimate jury which would choose between these different ideas . at the lhc , in addition to hunting for the higgs boson , the last piece of the sm puzzle",
    ", it may be possible to create some of the particles which make up about @xmath13 of the total matter in the universe , the dark matter that is ` invisible ' to light ; or probe the physics that makes the universe of today contain much more ` matter ' than anti - matter .",
    "the lhc can probe this synergy between the world at the femtoscale and the physics of the entire universe and provide answers to some very basic question about nature of things !",
    "this should clearly show that the ` stakes ' in these collider experiments are really high ! !      to understand the unique role particle physicists expect the lhc to play , it is a good idea to briefly look into the history of particle accelerators these high energy particle accelerators are like microscopes which have allowed us to peer at the heart of matter. high energy proton and electron beams produced using these accelerators",
    "have been used in two different modes : 1 ) the fixed target machines where @xmath16 and @xmath17 beams are incident on a stationary target which consists of light or heavy nuclei .",
    "2 ) colliders where beams of accelerated particles collide against each other . in the latter class",
    "only the @xmath18 and antiproton beams can be made to collide in enough numbers to make the experiments meaningful .    in case of a fixed target machine , for a beam of energy @xmath19 incident on a target of mass @xmath20 , total energy available for new particle production",
    "is @xmath21 , whereas in the collider environment , specialising to the case where both the beams have particles with same mass and energy , the energy available for particle production is @xmath22 . recall that mass of a proton , a typical target , is @xmath23 .",
    "thus the collider mode is superior for new particle production than the fixed target mode , from the point of view of energetics , as beam energies approach @xmath24 gev .",
    "for example , a particle called @xmath25 with mass @xmath26 , now understood to be a bound state of a charm - quark and an anti - charm quark , was produced for the first time in 1974 in an @xmath27 collider called spear at slac with a beam energy of @xmath28 gev , whereas soon after , the same particle was created in a fixed target experiment at the brookhaven national laboratory which employed proton beams accelerated to @xmath29 gev .",
    "but energy is only one consideration . equally important",
    "are the luminosity @xmath30 of collisions , i.e. the number of collisions per unit area , per unit time and the kind of interactions that the colliding particles possess .",
    "colliders became a popular tool only after the accelerator physicists developed better techniques to make intense , well focused beams .",
    "in fact the spear collider mentioned above , was one of the early example of a collider experiment . till then the burden of progress",
    "was carried mainly by the fixed target experiments .    through the early part of these explorations , experiments with beams of higher and higher",
    "energy just revealed constituents at smaller and smaller distance scales .",
    "after the discovery of the quarks , in 1968 , lying at the heart of protons and neutrons , the later increase in energy has brought about production of the force carriers and help develop / test the theory which can describe the interactions among the fundamental constituents .",
    "experiments with different fixed target machines and the colliders together , provided this information .    the colliders which helped particle physicists in this journey",
    "can be divided in to three different classes based on colliding particles .",
    "the leptonic colliders : 1)electron - positron ( @xmath27 ) and 2 ) electron - proton ( @xmath31 ) colliders and the hadronic colliders : 3)proton - proton(@xmath1 ) , proton - antiproton ( @xmath32 ) ones .    the story began with @xmath27 circular machines in the 60 s at frascati(italy ) , novosibirsk(russia ) and orsay(france ) .",
    "it then proceeded through spear ( 1973 ) , pep ( 1980 ) , slc(1990 ) at slac , stanford in usa ; doris(1973),petra(1979 ) at desy , hamburg in germany ; lep - i(ii)(1989 ) in cern , geneva , switzerland , with the beam energy increasing from a 1.5 gev at spear to up to ( 15 ) 23.4 gev at pep ( petra ) , 30 gev for tristan , 45 gev for lep - i , slc and 104.5 gev for lep - ii .",
    "the slc was the only linear collider among all these .",
    "machines , carrying on the legacy of doris at desy in germany and cesr at cornell in usa .",
    "this concerns travel on another front in experimental hep and not discussed further here . ]",
    "finally the story continues now to a possible international linear collider ( ilc ) or compact linear collider ( clic ) .",
    "it is not yet clear if and where the last mentioned colliders will be built but feasibility studies for these two already go on .",
    "next colliders to come into play were the proton - proton ( pp ) and proton - antiproton ( @xmath10 ) machines .",
    "the ps ( proton synchrotron ) built more than 50 years ago at cern ( and still working today ) fed high energy proton beams to the intersecting storage ring ( isr ) : world s first @xmath1 collider ( 1971 ) .",
    "the story then moved on to the super proton synchrotron to achieve @xmath33 collisions at the @xmath8 collider at cern , in 1983 .",
    "close on its heels was the tevatron in usa and now the hadronic machine at the forefront is the @xmath1 machine is the lhc .    interspersed with these pure leptonic and hadronic colliders , was a machine which collided electrons / positrons on proton .",
    "this @xmath34 collider hera in hamburg , germany , provided invaluable information on the quark and gluon content of the proton , which as we will see below is required to predict what particles the lhc can produce and at what rate .",
    "a list of some of these different leptonic and hadronic colliders , of relevance to the discussion here , is presented in the tables  [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] . due to the differences in the nature of the hadronic and leptonic colliders",
    ", they have played very complementary roles in our quest for the fundamental constituents of matter and interactions among them .",
    "shown in table  [ tab2 ]  .",
    "the quarks possess the so called ",
    "colour charge and hence a given quark pair appears three times in the counting in three different colours .",
    "the quarks u , d ( up , down ) make the normal matter ( which is colourless ) like protons / neutrons and these with the lightest charged lepton , the electron in fact make up atoms / molecules etc .",
    "all the remaining fundamental particles : the quarks strange(s ) , charm ( c ) , beauty ( b ) and top(t ) , the charged leptons @xmath35 and the neutral leptons : neutrinos ( @xmath36 s ) , are produced either in decays of nuclei or unstable particles and/or in high energy processes .",
    "the lighter quarks ( u , d , s ) manifest themselves only as bound states like protons , pions and kaons .",
    "the heavier quarks and charged leptons are all short lived , with life times of the order of @xmath37 sec . or lower .",
    "the neutrinos have only weak interactions , whereas the colourless charged leptons have weak and electromagnetic interactions and the coloured quarks feel all the three interactions .",
    "the properties of all the particles , the constituent matter particles and the force carriers , have been measured to a high degree of accuracy and the periodic table for particle physics is _ almost _ complete .",
    "hence , admittedly it is time to see if there is an underlying theory which explains the patterns in these properties such as their masses and electromagnetic charge etc . that we observe . to answer such questions",
    "one has to go beyond the sm .",
    "tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] do not contain one particle in the sm , viz .",
    "the higgs boson , which is neither a fundamental constituent of matter nor a force carrier .",
    "it was introduced to understand a particular mystery of weak interactions .",
    "these seem to treat the left handed matter particles , quark and leptons whose direction of the spin is opposite to the direction of motion , differently , from those which are right handed _",
    "i.e. _ those for which these two directions are parallel to each other . for a particle with a nonzero rest mass , a left handed state can be seen as a right handed state by simply going to a frame which is moving faster than the particle .",
    "thus the weak interactions then will depend on the frame of reference .",
    "this would be in conflict with einstein s theory of relativity .",
    "a theory with a higgs boson does not suffer from this problem .",
    "this boson is named after one of the scientists who originally proposed this , more than 45 years ago .",
    "it is thought to have no electric charge , and no spin . as for its mass ,",
    "unsuccessful searches at the lep collider and the tevatron collider , along with precise measurements of the weak interactions put @xmath38 to be in the range of 114 to @xmath3150 gev , the result being strictly true within the sm .      a number of different ideas for bsm physics have been put forward through the decades .",
    "they can be roughly classified into three classes : 1)the first class of models tries to keep the higgs mass small by introduction of an additional symmetry .",
    "one of the most elegant ways to do this is via supersymmetry .",
    "this is a symmetry between fermions(spin 1/2 particles ) and bosons ( integral spin particles ) .",
    "this implies that there exist supersymmetric partners of all the sm particles . in this case , there exist host of new particles which we should see at the colliders , particularly at the lhc  @xcite and it also has a dm candidate particle , the neutralino .",
    "the mass and interactions expected for the neutralino in susy models , falls in the range required to explain its abundance in the universe today .",
    "another class of models , called little higgs models , in fact tries to use the lessons learned from the sib in the case of the sm , to keep the higgs light . in this case also , there exist many additional fermions , gauge bosons in the theory at the tev scale , their interaction patterns being different than in the case of susy .",
    "2)the second class of models obviate the high energy scales which cause the theoretical predictions of corrections to higgs mass to become large .",
    "these models are much more radical in that , in general they postulate behaviour of space and time which is completely different than what we understand and involve one or more extra dimensions of space , which are compactified . these extra dimensions may even have warped geometry . in this case",
    ", the higgs remains light , it may or may not be a fundamental particle .",
    "gravity is free to propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "gravity in principle is as strong as the electroweak interaction , but appears weak in our world .",
    "tev - scale experiments probe the  strong gravity sector .",
    "thus there is again new physics at a tev scale .",
    "some of these ideas also make conceptual contact with quantum theory of gravitation and sometimes even have statements to make about early universe cosmology .",
    "it is an exciting possibility , where the tev energy colliders can probe structure of space time .",
    "even more interesting , string theory has now begun to make some statements about such models . in this case , the higgs remains light , it may or may not be a fundamental particle .",
    "it is fair to say that in general all the models in class 2 and 3 above have more trouble satisfying the constraints coming from the precision measurements than supersymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "not finding supersymmetric particles so far , has created another set of ` theoretical ' problems for supersymmetric theories which i will not go into here .",
