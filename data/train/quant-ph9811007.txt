    "the transfer of population in a multi - level atomic system from an initial to a target quantum state in a fast and effective way is currently a problem of practical importance as well as of substantial theoretical interest .",
    "if there is a dipole allowed transition between an initial and a target state , one can achieve the desired transfer by using either a constant - frequency @xmath0-pulse tuned to resonance , or an adiabatic process based on a swept carrier - frequency . since a dipole - allowed transition implies radiative decay , one is however often interested in systems with two metastable states without a direct electric - dipole coupling . whereas an extension of the two - state @xmath0-pulse approach to multistate excitation is possible , these techniques require careful control of the pulse areas .",
    "adiabatic processes do not require such precise control , if the time - evolution is slow ( meaning , generally , large pulse areas ) .",
    "in a three - state raman - transition system , for example , it is possible to achieve adiabatic passage with the use of two constant - frequency pulses suitably delayed ( counterintuitive order ) @xcite .",
    "the process of this stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite can be represented by a slow rotation of a decoupled eigenstate of the h amiltonian ( dark state ) @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of stirap is the requirement for large pulse areas : to ensure adiabatic time evolution the effective average rabi - frequency of the pulses must be large compared to the radiative decay rates of the intermediate level(s ) .",
    "non - adiabatic corrections and the associated diabatic losses @xcite , scale with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a characteristic interaction energy and @xmath3 is the effective time required for the transfer . in some potential applications , as for example the transfer of information in form of coherences , it is desirable to minimize these losses without the need of intense pulses or long transfer times .",
    "intense fields induce time - varying ac - stark shifts , which may be detrimental to the coherence transfer .",
    "short times are required to minimize the effect of decoherence processes during the transfer @xcite .",
    "an approach , which reduces non - adiabatic losses for pulses of moderate fluence in a three - state system , was recently introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition to the pair of raman pulses ( `` pump pulse '' and `` stokes pulse '' ) which couple the initial and target state via a common upper level , a direct coupling ( called `` detuning pulse '' ) between them is introduced .",
    "this scheme of loop - stirap does not require the usual adiabaticity conditions ( of large pulse areas ) , nor is it of the @xmath0-pulse type ( requiring specific pulse areas ) .",
    "nevertheless , the scheme can produce complete population transfer .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the physical mechanism of loop - stirap is not an adiabatic rotation of the dark state , but the rotation of a _ higher - order trapping state _ in a generalized adiabatic basis .",
    "the concept of generalized adiabatic basis sets allows to rationalize many examples of population transfer even when the adiabaticity condition is poorly fulfilled . if pump and stokes pulses fulfill certain conditions ( they are then called generalized matched pulses ) , a higher - order trapping exists , which is an exact constant of motion . in this case analytic solutions for the atomic dynamics",
    "can be found which in contrast to the case of ordinary matched pulses with identical pulse shape @xcite also include the possibility of population transfer .",
    "this can be exploited to design pulse sequences which give maximum population transfer .",
    "in contrast to techniques based on optimum control theory , which are used for such tasks , the generalized - dark - state concept provides a physical interpretation of the results .",
    "however , the design of pulse , which in some cases can lead to complete population transfer ( i.e. without _ any _ diabatic losses ) needs to respect more restrictive requirements for specific pulse properties similar to @xmath0-pulse techniques .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss the loop - stirap and propose a simple physical interpretation in terms of an adiabatic rotation of a generalized trapping state . in sec.iii we define generalized trapping states via an iterative partial diagonalization of the time - dependent hamiltonian . in sec.iv we derive conditions under which a higher - order trapping state is an exact constant of motion and",
    "thus allow for an analytic solution of the atomic dynamics .",
