    "the ligo project @xcite is part of the current initiative to detect gravitational radiation via its perturbing effects on resonant laser interferometers .",
    "this initiative involves several large collaborations around the world , including virgo @xcite , geo @xcite , tama @xcite , and aciga @xcite .",
    "a paramount issue in all such projects is the maximization of interferometer sensitivity to detect the extremely weak signals that are expected from even the most powerful astrophysical sources @xcite . to that end ,",
    "coupled - cavity systems with multiple resonant stages will be used to maximize the shot - noise - limited signal - to - noise ratio of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal readout . for these complex interferometric detectors ,",
    "intensive modeling is necessary to estimate their performance in the presence of general optical imperfections .",
    "a hierarchy of approaches has been used to estimate detector performance , each method negotiating the trade - off between accuracy and computational complexity .",
    "analytical methods may suffice for the consideration of optical defects that can be treated as pure losses , or for some cases involving geometric @xcite or randomized @xcite mirror deformations .",
    "a matrix model that evaluates the coupling between the first few lowest - order tem laser modes has been shown to be useful for the study of mirror tilts and beam displacements @xcite ; and another matrix model using discrete hankel transforms exists for problems with axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "such models , which consider the exchange of power between a limited set of pre - specified modes , allow one to obtain fast results that can be used for predicting certain important interferometer behaviors ( e.g. , time - dependent detector responses @xcite ) , at the expense of some sophistication in modeling the detailed interferometer steady - state power buildup . for the consideration of highly general optical imperfections , however , the most comprehensive method is the complete modeling of the transverse structure of the laser field wavefronts ; this method simulates the electric fields on large grids , and uses ( fourier transform - based ) numerical computations for the propagations of these laser beams through long cavities @xcite .",
    "this technique is useful in the case of mirrors with complex deformations , and for mirrors with significant losses ( due to absorption , scattering , and/or diffractive loss from finite - sized apertures ) , that violate the assumption of unitarity @xcite for mirror operators in the matrix models , thus introducing complications into that approach @xcite .",
    "grid - based simulations of intra - cavity laser fields have a long history ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and have been applied previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) to the study of the interferometric gw detectors now being implemented .",
    "but simplifications are generally imposed , such as restricting the optical deformations that are studied ( e.g. , considering only geometric imperfections , like tilt and curvature mismatch @xcite ) , and/or by modeling a relatively simple cavity system @xcite . in this paper , we describe a simulation program ( originally based upon the work of vinet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) that has been extended to efficiently model the complex fields that build up between realistically imperfect optical components , while resonating within complete , coupled - cavity interferometers like those used for the ligo detectors .",
    "versions of our program have been used for a variety of applications by the gravitational wave community , including numerous design and performance estimation tasks conducted by the ligo group itself ( see section [ s6 ] ) , as well as for collaborative investigations between ligo scientists and other groups   such as aciga - ligo efforts to explore alternative interferometer length control schemes @xcite , and tama - ligo efforts to estimate the effects of mirror imperfections @xcite and thermal lensing @xcite upon the performances of their future , large - scale interferometers .",
    "a wide variety of interferometer imperfections can be modeled with our program , including mirror tilts and shifts , beam mismatch and/or misalignment , diffractive loss from finite mirror apertures , mirror surface figure and substrate inhomogeneity profiles   in particular , using deformation phase maps that are adapted from measurements of real mirror surfaces and substrates   as well as fluctuations of reflection and transmission intensity across the mirror profiles .",
    "in addition to the main ( carrier frequency ) laser field , auxiliary fields ( i.e. , radio frequency sidebands ) for ligo s heterodyne signal detection scheme are also modeled , allowing us to give absolute numbers for the shot - noise - limited gw - sensitivity of a single ligo interferometer .",
    "furthermore , a number of active optimization procedures are performed continuously during code execution , guaranteeing that several key parameters in the ligo configuration will be brought to their optimum values upon program completion ; the gw - sensitivity is thus maximized for each specific `` realistic '' interferometer , given the particular imperfections being simulated in that run . considering the time needed for program execution , we note that though our principal usage of the program has been on various supercomputing platforms , a full run of the simulation code ( with all options included ) can be performed in a non - prohibitive amount of time on a modest sun sparcstation , even for significantly ( and non - symmetrically ) deformed mirrors .",
    "this has been achieved through a combination of fast iteration techniques , efficient parameter optimization routines , and procedures designed to carefully choose the initial guesses for laser fields that are computed via relaxation .",
    "lastly , we note that versions of the code are available for both the first - generation ligo and advanced - ligo ( dual recycling @xcite ) configurations @xcite , though we will focus primarily upon the former in this paper .",
    "the discussion is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] , we give a description of the physical system that is modeled here ( i.e. , a first - generation ligo interferometer ) , and the computed electric fields that are necessary for the calculation of its shot - noise - limited gw - sensitivity function . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we provide an overview of the technical details of the program s operations , including the modeling of the optics , the iterative method used for computing the interferometer s electric fields , and the various optimization procedures that are performed to maximize its sensitivity . in section [ s4 ] , we present an array of runs with representative sets of mirror substrate and surface deformation maps adapted from real mirror measurements , in order to demonstrate how realistically - deformed mirrors will reduce the circulating power stored in a ligo interferometer ( as well as altering its modal structure ) , thus degrading the interferometer sensitivity and interfering with its control systems . in section [ s5 ] , we discuss the impact of optical imperfections upon ligo science capabilities , by estimating how deformed - mirror effects will reduce ligo s ability to detect astrophysical sources of gravitational waves , such as non - axisymmetric pulsars and coalescing black hole binaries @xcite . in section [ s6 ] , we conclude with a discussion of various ligo research and development initiatives to which this grid - based simulation work has contributed .",

[ fg1 ] , essentially a michelson interferometer , converts the differential arm length changes caused by a gravitational wave ( gw ) into an oscillating output field amplitude at the exit port of the beamsplitter , where a carrier field dark - fringe would otherwise ( ideally ) have been maintained .",
    "the partially - transmitting input mirrors @xmath0 and highly - reflective end mirrors @xmath1 form fabry - perot ( fp ) arm cavities in the `` inline '' and `` offline '' arms , which amplify this effect ; and the power recycling mirror @xmath2 provides a broadband amplification for the stored energy in the interferometer that is available for signal detection @xcite .",
    "coupling occurs between the fields from each of the different cavities in this optical configuration , and is responsible for the complex response behaviors of the system .",
    "radio - frequency modulation sidebands ( `` rf - sidebands '' ) impressed upon the carrier - frequency input light serve as a `` local oscillator '' for a heterodyne detection scheme @xcite .",
    "substantial rf - sideband power is made to emerge from the beamsplitter exit / signal port , and it is added to the quantity of gw - induced carrier light that is escaping there , to ultimately produce an output signal linear in _ h _ , the dimensionless amplitude of the gw .",
    "the carrier power is maximized by giving it a double - resonance : it is first resonant in ( either of ) the fp arm cavities , and again resonant in the `` power recycling cavity '' ( prc ) formed by mirrors @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5",
    ". alternatively , the rf - sidebands ( in this standard ligo detection scheme ) are only resonant in the prc , to take advantage of the broadband amplification there ; but they are far - off - resonance in the long fp - arms , so that they may serve as a stable reference which is unaffected by gravitational waves .    assuming that the carrier is held to its double resonance ( giving it a phase shift of @xmath6 in resonant reflection from the fp - arms @xcite ) , the rf - sidebands have their own resonance requirements , defined by the two conditions : @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . referring to fig .",

    "the first ( anti - resonance ) condition is not enforced as a precise equality , in order to avoid the unwanted resonance of non - negligible second - order modulation sidebands ( at @xmath14 ) in the fp arm cavities .",
    "but the second ( prc - resonance ) condition must be achieved to sub - wavelength tolerances , and requires careful fine - tuning corrections due to the effects of realistically - deformed optics ( see sec .",
    "[ s3s3s2 ] ) .",
    "the heterodyne gw - signal is obtained by interfering the gw - induced carrier beam at the beamsplitter exit / signal port with the emerging sideband beams , and demodulating the resultant photodiode output signal at @xmath15 .",
    "efficient coupling of the rf - sidebands to the signal port is achieved by incorporating a macroscopic length asymmetry between the two arms of the prc , @xmath16 , thus allowing an optimal fraction of sideband power to be extracted at the exit port during each round - trip through the prc , even while the carrier is held to a dark - fringe there .",
    "this signal generation method ( see sec .  [ s3s3s4 ] ) is referred to as the `` schnupp asymmetry scheme '' @xcite .    to simplify our simulation task ,",
    "we model only those aspects of the ligo system which have a direct role in generating the gw - signals : the aforementioned carrier beam , and its rf - sidebands , resonating in the core optical system of fig .",
    "if we make the ( good ) approximation that most of the sensitivity - limiting shot noise at the beamsplitter exit port is due to these fields   some carrier field power emerging ( primarily ) because of imperfect dark - fringe contrast , and rf - sideband field power being maximally channeled to the exit port   and neglect contributions from various other fields used for interferometer control systems , or from other ( controlled ) noise couplings @xcite , then we can do a full calculation of the shot - noise - limited gw - sensitivity of the simulated interferometer . beyond this , rather than explicitly emulating all of the control systems of the real ligo , the simulation program uses alternative methods ( see sec .  [ s3s3 ] ) for the numerous parameter adjustments ( resonance finding , etc . ) that are needed to optimize interferometer performance ; and it does so in a manner that reflects the behavior of the real system as accurately as possible .    in summary ,",
    "the primary goal of our modeling efforts is to completely solve for the steady - state carrier and sideband fields that resonate in a ligo interferometer with realistic optical imperfections , which is held to its proper operating point , and is optimally configured for maximal gw - sensitivity .",
    "the full effects of optical imperfections upon the sensitivity of interferometric detectors are then determined from these simulated cavity fields .",
    "here we present an overview of the program and its operations during execution , and the additional tasks which must be done during pre- and post - processing stages in the course of performing simulation experiments .",
    "the full technical details of our work can be found in @xcite .    in regards to computing platforms , the simulation program was originally written in the sparccompiler 3.0 version of fortran 77 .",
    "a complete run ( including carrier and sideband frequencies , with all interferometer fields computed and all optimizations done ) with a set of non - ideal mirrors , and with ( for example ) @xmath17 pixelized grid maps used for the optical computations , takes less than a day on a 2-processor sparcstation 20 .",
    "this computation time is reduced to a couple of minutes when the program is executed on massively - parallel supercomputing platforms ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the runs to be presented in this paper were performed using 32 nodes of the paragon machine _ trex _",
    "@xcite , a 512 ( compute ) node machine utilizing intel i860 processors .",
    "we use the customary approach @xcite for the grid - based modeling of the laser field wavefronts : a primary propagation direction is assumed for the collimated beam(s ) in each part of the interferometer , and a perpendicular slice can be taken anywhere along the beam propagation axis , at locations of interest .",
    "each of these beam slices is recorded on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) grid , with a pixel entry representing the complex electric field ( `` e - field '' ) amplitude at that transverse spatial position in the slice .",
    "figure [ fg2 ] is an example of such a grid - based electric field , in particular that of a hermite - gaussian tem@xmath18 mode @xcite .",
    "no polarization vector is currently recorded in our grids ( we can not , for example , model birefringence effects ) .",
    "the precision that can be achieved by the program depends upon how accurately it simulates the two basic physical processes which must be performed on the interferometer e - fields : _ propagations _ , and _ interactions with mirrors_. we discuss propagations first .    transverse slice of a hermite - gaussian tem@xmath18 mode ( only the real part is shown ) , taken at the waist plane of the beam , and recorded on a @xmath19 pixelized grid . ]",
    "the program utilizes siegman s method @xcite for the plane - to - plane propagation of light in the paraxial approximation , performed via a three step process : a fourier transform and an inverse transform , sandwiched around a pixel - by - pixel multiplication step in spatial - frequency - space ( `` _ _ k__-space '' ) , in which the e - field slice is multiplied with a distance - dependent 2d propagator matrix of the same pixelization . for each curved , potentially jagged mirror profile",
    "to be simulated , a flat plane is defined near that side of the optic to serve as a reference plane .",
    "propagations thus translate an e - field slice through the large distance from an initial reference plane to a destination reference plane near a mirror ( or at any chosen position along the beam axis ) .",
    "the computationally intensive parts of this process ( i.e. , the transforms ) can be performed rapidly by a fast fourier transform ( fft ) routine ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all such macroscopic - distance propagations ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) of e - fields are done in this manner .",
    "a very important issue to deal with for propagations is the problem of _ aliasing _",
    "@xcite , a common complication for calculational procedures that use discrete fourier transform methods .",
    "aliasing can create artifacts in the simulation results if ( relatively ) large - angle scattering sends power beyond the edge of the grid calculational window during the propagations .",
    "such power automatically re - enters the calculation from the other side of the grid , and may ( fraudulently ) be incorporated back in the physical simulation , instead of being filtered out , as it would be by absorbing baffles in a real interferometer .",
    "this problem is most significant for the long propagations through the 4 km fp arm cavities",
    ".    we can reduce ( or eliminate ) such aliasing by filtering the relevant _ k_-space matrix that will multiply an e - field slice , in between the fourier transform and inverse - transform steps of a propagation .",
    "the goal is to preserve as much `` real power '' , while eliminating as much `` aliased power '' , as possible ; the distinction between them is that the former always stays within the apertures of the finite - sized mirrors , while the latter leaves the grid completely , but re - enters from the other side and comes far enough into the middle of the grid to fall once again within the mirror apertures",
    ".    let @xmath21 be the physical side - length of the square calculational window , @xmath22 be the mirror aperture diameter , and @xmath23 be the propagation distance length .",
    "the cutoff between physically real power and `` aliasing '' power is a matter of propagation angle : power traveling at @xmath24 may be able to stay within the mirrors , while power with @xmath25 usually can not , but will sometimes be able to leave the grid _ and _ return to erroneously re - enter the mirror apertures . for a discrete grid with @xmath26 pixels on a side ( numbered @xmath27 ) ,",
    "these angles correspond to ( respectively ) the pixel numbers @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the light wavelength .",
    "all of the aliasing power can be safely eliminated by nulling pixels with @xmath31 in the _ k_-space propagator matrix , without removing any real power , as long as @xmath32 .",
    "but if @xmath33 , then one must choose some compromise between _ keeping _ real power and _ cutting out _ aliasing power for pixels @xmath34 . one can , of course , force @xmath32 to be true by increasing the calculational window size to be much larger than the mirrors ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) , but this requires more pixels to be used in the grid ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) , which increases the computational load .",
    "making @xmath21 large without using an adequate number of pixels would lead to poor sampling of the laser beam itself @xcite , thus creating a new aliasing problem , due to the inadequate resolution of the discrete grids . in our runs",
    ", we use large calculational windows and many pixels whenever possible ( such as for the runs presented below ) ; but when necessary , the program has an option which applies an apodization scheme to `` trim '' the propagation operators in a way that enforces a graduated compromise between keeping real power and eliminating aliasing power .",
    "next , we consider mirror interactions .",
    "the program must carry out two basic mirror interaction operations : reflections ( @xmath37 ) and transmissions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "mirrors will not be perfectly uniform or flat in the direction transverse to the beam ; they will have inhomogeneities in the refraction index and/or thickness of their substrates , spatially - varying surface height profiles , variations in the quality of the reflective coatings , macroscopic curvatures , tilts , etc .",
    "this leads to optical path length variations ( i.e. , spatially - varying phase delays ) across their profiles , as well as variations in the _ amplitudes _ of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the latter mostly due to variations in the reflective side or anti - reflective ( ar ) side coatings .",
    "these phase and amplitude effects are simulated by creating complex mirror maps for all @xmath37 and @xmath38 operators , which are also recorded on 2d pixelized grids . as demonstrated by vinet _",
    "@xcite , it is a good ( `` short distance '' ) approximation to treat each pixel of the beam as an independent little plane wave , and reflect ( or transmit ) that piece of the e - field by multiplying that pixel in the e - field map by the corresponding pixel in the relevant mirror map , so that each e - field pixel interacts only with the mirror pixel located immediately in front of it . thus each mirror reflection or transmission operation",
    "is reduced to a pixel - by - pixel multiplication step between a mirror operator map and the e - field slice on the reference plane near to it .",
    "the simulation program uses these mirror interaction operations , in combination with the propagation algorithm described above , to model the entire behavior of the laser fields in the interferometer .",
    "there are some limitations in using this methodology for mirror interactions , besides the obvious one of restricting it to operations over short distances ( i.e. , in the near - field ) .",
    "@xcite derive a requirement which specifies how small the deviations of a mirror profile can be from its idealized shape , before this pixel - by - pixel multiplication method loses a large amount of accuracy compared to the exact calculation via the huygens - fresnel integral formulation in scalar wave theory @xcite . realistically imperfect",
    "( ligo - quality ) mirrors easily satisfy this requirement . furthermore , as noted by tridgell _",
    "@xcite , the difference in phase between one pixel in a mirror map and its neighbor must be smaller than @xmath39 if a continuously - varying surface displacement on the mirror is to be adequately sampled by the grid . for our simulation parameters ( cf .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] ) , this limits mirror tilts to @xmath40 radians ( not including the base @xmath41 tilt of the beamsplitter , which is handled separately ) , and mirror curvature radii to @xmath42 ; both of these limitations are easily satisfied in our runs . finally , we supplement these requirements with a general rule - of - thumb : a _ tiny gaussian beam _ , with a waist size equal to the width of a pixel ( _ and _ an initial propagation direction with respect to the beam axis that is defined by the e - field s wavefront curvature at the location of that pixel ) , must not expand or shift over so much so that it would relocate a significant fraction of its power onto any neighboring pixels , during the entire course of the mirror interaction . if that rule is broken , then this method for mirror interactions will be inaccurate , and the pixel - by - pixel multiplication of maps will not be sufficient for modeling reflection or transmission operations .    to create a complete ( but not over - determined ) description of a mirror , we consider the full information expressed by mirror interactions , as well as physical symmetries and the conservation of energy . a 2-port mirror ( reflective- and ar - sides )",
    "must relate 2 complex input fields to 2 complex output fields .",
    "thus 4 complex ( or 8 real ) elements are needed , at each pixel location , to specify that pixel of mirror completely .",
    "these 4 complex elements correspond to the complex reflection and transmission operations performed from the two different sides of the mirror .",
    "the two transmission operations from either side   barring excessive beam expansion or focusing during the transmission   must in fact be the same @xcite : @xmath43 ( except for the beamsplitter , which requires distinct transmission maps for the inline and offline paths ) .",
    "the mirror description is thus reduced to 3 complex elements per pixel , i.e. , 3 complex mirror maps : the transmission map _",
    "t _ , and reflection maps from either side , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "next , by energy conservation we have ( for each mirror pixel ) : @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the losses experienced in reflection from either side of the mirror .",
    "but these conditions are not sufficient . by considering the complete ,",
    "superposed e - fields which exist on either side of the mirror , both before and after the mirror interaction ( i.e. , the incoming e - fields vs. the outgoing ones ) , and by requiring that the total power in all e - fields _ must not increase _ due to the interaction , one may obtain the following inequality ( expressed in terms of the incoming , `` before '' fields ) :    @xmath50    for the simplest case of a loss - free mirror ( @xmath51 = 0 , and @xmath52 ) , this just reduces to the complex generalization of one of stokes relations @xcite : @xmath53 . assuming the transmission coefficient @xmath38 to be real",
    ", this generates the familiar possibilities for the phase relationships between the reflectivities on either side of a mirror : e.g. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , etc . for the more general case of a lossy mirror",
    ", we can convert eq .",
    "( [ dispeq1 ] ) into a simpler prescription by considering variations to the relative phases and amplitudes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , thus generating the strict energy conservation condition : @xmath58 this inequality ( generalized further for the beamsplitter ) must be satisfied ( at every pixel ) to guarantee conservation of energy in a mirror , given any e - fields which could be incident upon it .",
    "our simulation program enforces this condition by testing the input data maps for each mirror , and rejecting runs with unphysical specifications .",
    "given all of these requirements , the pixelized mirror maps described above are versatile tools for modeling a wide variety of optical features and imperfections , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] .",
    "our program models a static interferometer , assumed to be held to the correct operating point for an indefinite period of time .",
    "this assumption enormously simplifies the program , and our overall simulation task , while still enabling us ( see sec .",
    "[ s3s4 ] ) to compute the frequency - dependent gw - response of a ligo interferometer .",
    "( the dynamics of ligo control systems do not necessarily come into this calculation , since the mirrors act like `` free - masses '' at the gw - frequencies that ligo is most sensitive to , and because the gw s are presumably not strong enough to interfere with the interferometer s resonant lock . )",
    "the primary task of the simulation program , therefore , is to compute the relaxed , steady - state , resonant electric fields that build up in each part of the interferometer , when it is excited by a laser beam of fixed amplitude , orientation , and frequency ( at the nominal carrier and sideband frequencies ) , entering through the power recycling mirror .",
    "the multiply - coupled - cavity nature of the interferometer , and the physical complexity of the simulation , means that the program must iteratively solve for an irreducible number of resonant e - fields ( one per cavity ) in the interferometer . for the first - generation ligo configuration ,",
    "three e - fields must be computed via relaxation : one in the prc , and one in each of the fp arm cavities ( though the precise location of each relaxed e - field in its cavity can be arbitrarily chosen ) .",
    "when the relaxation algorithm is finished , these three principal e - fields can be propagated , reflected , transmitted , and/or superposed together in order to generate the complete steady - state e - fields everywhere in the system .    for each e - field that will be relaxed , there is a steady - state equation of the form : @xmath59 the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq3 ] ) is the e - field to be solved for ; we display it here as a vector because it has a propagation direction : either `` forward '' or `` backward '' along the beam axis .",
    "the expression , @xmath60 , represents this steady - state e - field after it has gone on a round - trip through the interferometer , and has returned to its starting point .",
    "( note that this `` round - trip '' includes all possible closed - loop paths through the interferometer that do not ever pass through the same location   with the same propagation direction   of any of the other principal e - fields being relaxed . )",
    "lastly , @xmath61 represents a composite excitation e - field , which may consist of both a primary excitation e - field ( e.g. , the input laser beam , for the e - field being relaxed in the prc ) , plus any `` leak '' e - fields that arrive from the other principal fields being relaxed ( e.g. , fields leaking from the fp - arms into the prc ) .",
    "it is this leak - field part of the excitation term which is the source of many coupled - cavity effects in the interferometer ; and it is the presence of the @xmath62 term in eq .",
    "( [ dispeq3 ] ) which makes @xmath63 `` self - coupled '' , thus requiring us @xcite to use an iterative process to solve for it .    specifying a relaxation convergence scheme",
    "is done by prescribing how the @xmath64 iterative guess for a given e - field is obtained from its @xmath65 iteration ( and from the @xmath65 iteration of the other e - fields being relaxed simultaneously ) .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ dispeq3 ] ) , the simplest possibility is to make the choice : @xmath66 this process can then be repeated for as many iterations as necessary , until the steady - state equation , eq .",
    "( [ dispeq3 ] ) , is satisfied by @xmath67 to within a pre - specified threshold of accuracy ( typically 1 part in @xmath68 in power , for our runs ) .",
    "this relaxation formula is guaranteed to succeed at smoothly converging an e - field to its correct steady - state form   barring complications which may arise from changes to the interferometer caused by the parameter optimization routines ( see sec .",
    "[ s3s3 ] )   because it imitates how power actually does build up , through a sum of many bounces , in the cavity system of a real interferometer .",
    "this iteration process has been used successfully by previous researchers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since",
    "this method does model the true physical buildup of power , however , it requires a great many iterations to converge , especially for coupled - cavity systems with large q - factors ( i.e. , long transient decay times ) .",
    "we have found this relaxation scheme to be forbiddingly slow for a full - ligo simulation program .    therefore , as first suggested ( and implemented , for a simpler cavity arrangement ) by a ligo colleague @xcite , our simulation program uses a different approach . instead of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq4 ] ) for choosing the @xmath64 iteration , we use the following expression : @xmath69 where @xmath70 are unknown , complex coefficients that are solved for by minimizing the error in what the steady - state equation will become in the _ next _ round , with @xmath71 ( as a function of these unknown coefficients ) taking the place of @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ dispeq3 ] ) , and @xmath72 taking the place of @xmath61 ( noting that @xmath72 does not yet take into account the new @xmath70 coefficients that will be chosen for the _ other _ e - fields being iterated ) . the resulting expression for the steady - state error can be differentiated with respect to the six available degrees of freedom ( the real and imaginary parts of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) , resulting in six simultaneous equations that are solved via matrix inversion .",
    "this relaxation method ( which essentially reverts to the simpler method if we set @xmath76 ) gains a huge advantage compared to the method of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq4 ] ) , by having these additional , useful degrees of freedom available for each iteration @xcite .",
    "the number of iterations necessary to achieve convergence are greatly reduced ( often by @xmath771 - 2 orders of magnitude ) , resulting in much faster e - field relaxation .",
    "this `` abc '' iteration algorithm does have certain drawbacks .",
    "it is more difficult to implement in code , and it requires more information to be stored ( thus using more memory ) , and more propagations to be performed ( despite what is stated in @xcite , because we use three unknown coefficients instead of two : @xmath78 ) , during each iteration .",
    "it is also somewhat less stable , because of the wide range of abc - coefficients that may be chosen by the error minimization algorithm ; in fact , large excursions in the iterated e - field structure and power level appear to be _ required _ during ( typically ) the first @xmath7750 - 100 iterations , in order for the accelerated convergence scheme to function properly .",
    "we have found that the best ( straightforward ) way to enhance the convergence stability of the `` abc '' relaxation algorithm , without slowing it down to the pace of the method of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq4 ] ) , is to place hard limits upon the allowed choices of the abc - coefficients during the early stages ( the first @xmath77100 - 200 iterations ) of runs .",
    "this allows the relaxation process to avoid failure during the initial , large e - field adjustments , after which it settles down to converge efficiently to the steady - state solution .",
    "lastly , we note that the choice of @xmath70 for any one field will affect future iterations of the other fields , because they are all coupled via the @xmath61 leak - fields . iterating them independently from one",
    "another ignores this coupling , and causes some slowing ( and oscillation ) of the relaxation process ( we see a temporary `` sloshing '' of power back and forth between the prc field and the fp arm cavity fields ) .",
    "this problem can be eliminated by choosing the @xmath70 coefficients for all three relaxed e - fields _ simultaneously _ , by calculating the 18 unknown parameters ( i.e. , 9 complex `` abc '' coefficients ) in order to minimize a specially - weighted sum of the iteration errors for all three relaxed fields .",
    "such a `` global abc '' relaxation scheme is significantly more demanding in terms of coding difficulty and computer memory usage , but it is capable of making the relaxation process more stable , and further reduces the number of iterations needed to reach convergence . though we have not yet implemented this global relaxation scheme into simulations of the first - generation ligo interferometer , we have successfully incorporated global abc relaxation ( with four relaxed e - fields needed , instead of three ) into the version of our code used for the advanced - ligo dual recycling configuration , with good results @xcite .    in summary , the `` abc '' iteration method presented here is a sufficiently reliable and _ extremely fast _ relaxation scheme which greatly reduces program execution time , thus enabling us to perform full - ligo simulation runs ( with significant optical deformations ) in a reasonable amount of time .      at the core of our efforts to make a realistic simulation of a ligo interferometer are several procedures which bring the system into an `` optimal '' configuration for signal detection . the problem of optimization is a highly nontrivial matter : not only does the interferometer possess numerous degrees of freedom that must be optimized ( e.g. , all resonant cavity lengths , the schnupp length asymmetry , etc . ) , but each evaluation of performance ( i.e. , gw - sensitivity ) as a function of these optimizable parameters is extremely time consuming , since it requires the detailed computation of the carrier and sideband e - fields everywhere in the interferometer .",
    "it therefore appears infeasible to use the brute - force method of optimizing the interferometer s gw - sensitivity function by evaluating it for a thorough sampling of points over the entire , multidimensional parameter space .    as an alternative , each key parameter",
    "is optimized separately in our program , using some error signal ( to be brought to zero ) , or some function of merit ( to optimize ) , which is strongly ( and solely ) dependent upon that individual parameter , and which is a true measure of when that parameter is well chosen for the maximization of gw - sensitivity .",
    "this strategy is aided by the fact that the interferometer s gw - sensitivity is quite insensitive to particular _",
    "combinations _ of parameter changes , such that if certain optimizable parameters are displaced from one apparently optimal point in the multidimensional parameter space , then the other parameters will adjust themselves ( via our optimization procedures ) to compensate with virtually no reduction in overall interferometer sensitivity .",

    "but finer adjustments are required for the prc resonance condition , and since the cavity lengths are already fixed by the resonance requirements of the carrier beam ( the carrier and sideband e - fields are relaxed in separate code executions , with the carrier first ) , the free parameter which remains to be adjusted is the sideband frequency . in a manner analogous to that specified for cavity length changes , sideband frequency adjustments for resonance",
    "are periodically computed as : @xmath88 ; though somewhat smaller frequency changes are actually made in practice , during each adjustment , to lessen the disturbances to the e - field relaxation process .",
    "the cumulative frequency change for typical runs is small ( usually a few hundred hz or less ) , but necessary to achieve sideband prc resonance .",
    "lastly , we note that the overall results of runs for the two different rf - sidebands ( i.e. , the `` upper '' and `` lower '' sidebands , @xmath89 ) are usually fairly similar ; we generally perform computations for only one sideband , and assume mirror - image results for the other .",

    "the reflectivities of most of the mirrors have been predetermined according a variety of auxiliary physical requirements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the principal criterion for specifying the reflectivity of the power recycling mirror @xmath2 is the maximization of the gain that is achievable with power recycling .",

    "the modulation depth optimization is performed as a post - processing step , after the simulation runs for the carrier and sideband e - fields have been completed .",
    "besides the straightforward optimization of the shot - noise - limited gw - sensitivity ( see eq .",

    "( a `` substrate tilt '' is merely a mirror thickness wedge , which can be countered in a real interferometer by a small change to the reference axis of a cavity . )    for irregular mirror profiles , which do not possess a unique definition of tilt , we choose the most useful definition for a ligo interferometer : the tilt that is experienced ( or `` weighted '' ) by a gaussian - profile incident beam .",
    "to first order , the effect of mirror tilts about the two axes perpendicular to a ( predominantly hermite - gaussian tem@xmath87 ) incident beam is to generate power in the tem@xmath18 and tem@xmath111 modes , in a reflection from that mirror @xcite .",

    "this is done after first removing any piston offset from the mirror , via uniform displacements that set @xmath115 to zero .",
    "an important point about this procedure is that the appropriate beam spot size must be used for the modes in the overlap coefficients given above , in order for the `` beam - weighting '' of each mirror s tilt to be correct ; but since the beam spot size is different at different locations in the interferometer , one must therefore know which specific mirror a given deformation map will be used for , before its tilt can be properly removed . also , we note that this tilt - removal process will actually give the full mirror a nonzero tilt , overall ; but the _ center _ of the mirror ( i.e. , the part most sampled by the beam ) will be essentially flat ( on average ) with respect to the plane transverse to the beam propagation axis .",

    "note that a direct comparison of the substrate rms value with that of the surfaces is not informative , since the substrates are typically sampled less frequently by the electric fields ( particularly for the carrier light resonating in the fp arm cavities ) , and are therefore less significant ( for the carrier fields , at least ) in their effects .",

    "quadratic _ dependence upon the deformation amplitudes shows an _ increase _ in exit - port sideband power , as the deformation levels get very large .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior is due to great effectiveness of the parameter optimizations ( cf .",
    "[ s3s3 ] )   specifically that of the schnupp length asymmetry , which is forced to a larger value for highly deformed mirrors , in order to get the sideband fields out of the degraded interferometer as soon as possible .",
    "this type of behavior for the sideband fields in the presence of highly deformed mirrors , though technically correct , may be unduly optimistic when considered in the context of a real ligo system , in which the many parameters are not as easily adjustable   if at all adjustable   in the experimental system , as they are in the simulation program . ] .",
    "this is as expected , since power scattered out of a gaussian beam by mirror roughness scales like the square of the roughness amplitude , even when the deformations are spread over a range of spatial frequencies @xcite .",
    "for example , the effects of imperfect mirrors on the fp arm cavity power buildup can be expressed in terms of an equivalent `` effective mirror loss '' that would analytically reproduce the same amount of circulating fp - arm power .",
    "doing this for each of the runs , we obtain an effective loss function that increases quadratically ( versus mirror surface rms deformation amplitude ) from the baseline value of @xmath7750 parts per million of `` absorptive '' loss that is put in by hand for each mirror @xcite .",
    "similarly , the contrast defect ( @xmath162 ) , which comes from power coupled into non - tem@xmath87 beam modes by ( longer spatial wavelength ) optical imperfections , is also well represented by a quadratic fit , as is shown in fig .",
    "lastly , the _ optimized _ recycling mirror ( power ) reflectivity , @xmath3 , should decrease quadratically from its `` perfect mirrors '' value , since 1-@xmath93 is directly proportional to interferometer losses ( cf .",
    "[ s3s3s3 ] ) , and the dominant losses ( contrast defect loss and high - angle scattering in the fp - arms ) are both quadratically dependent upon mirror deformation rms",

    "the dashed line is a quadratic fit to the points representing the runs performed with , respectively : `` perfect mirrors '' , then the @xmath141 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 mirrors .",
    "the horizontal lines are upper limits on the contrast defect values allowed for the first - generation ligo and enhanced - ligo interferometers , respectively . ]",
    "the most significant issue to address was whether ligo would be able to perform according to project requirements @xcite , given mirrors with realistic levels of optical deformations .",
    "that question is answered in the affirmative , as demonstrated in table [ tbl2 ] and fig s .",
    "[ fg5]-[fg6 ] , for all cases except that of the worst surfaces simulated here .",
    "first of all , the first - generation ligo interferometers are required to have a carrier power gain of at least 30 in the prc , and this target is achieved in all runs except for the ( ultra - conservative ) run performed with @xmath145 surface deformations .",
    "in addition , the first - generation interferometers must have a contrast defect of @xmath182 , a requirement that is also satisfied by all runs other then the @xmath145 case ( and anything better than @xmath183 would suffice ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been quoted @xcite that the `` enhanced '' ligo interferometers should satisfy the more stringent requirement of @xmath184 , which would be achieved by three of the five simulation runs here ( and anything better than @xmath185 would suffice )   an acceptable result , especially considering the likelihood of improved mirror quality by the time the enhanced interferometers are operational .",
    "one caveat , however , is that although the contrast defect requirements are met for most of the runs , a large amount of total power ( several hundred milliwatts ) falls upon the output photodetector in all cases , especially for runs with highly deformed mirrors in which the optimized sideband modulation depth is large , in order to help the signal compete against increased shot noise .",
    "if a signal detection apparatus that could handle this large amount of power can not be supplied , then an output mode cleaner may be needed ; table [ tbl2 ] shows that an output mode cleaner would greatly reduce the power that the photodetector must accommodate ( while also improving the gw - sensitivity by @xmath7715% ) , as long as it operates closely enough to an `` idealized '' performance , as described above .",
    "comparison of the shot noise curves , @xmath122 , computed for each of the interferometer simulation runs , against the official gw - strain - equivalent noise envelope requirement for the first - generation ligo interferometers . ]",
    "the most fundamental requirement to be satisfied is that the shot - noise - limited sensitivity curve for an interferometer with deformed mirrors ( cf .",
    "( [ dispeq11 ] ) , ( [ dispeq14 ] ) ) should fall within the bounds of the _ gw - strain - equivalent noise envelope requirement _ , which is the official total - noise limit set for the ( full 4 km baseline ) first - generation ligo interferometers @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fg6 ] , the computed @xmath122 curves for these runs are plotted against the data points that define the ligo requirement envelope , with all data given in terms of spectral densities .",
    "the seismic , thermal , and shot - noise - dominated regimes of the requirement envelope are apparent in the figure , and our @xmath122 curves can be compared to the shot - noise - dominated region .",
    "we conclude , once again , that all runs other than the @xmath145 case succeed in meeting the initial - ligo requirement .",
    "the overall conformity of these results indicates that there is a very clear   and very strict , though achievable   quality level for the core optics that must be reached in order for the first - generation ligo interferometers to achieve their target performances .",
    "to place the results of our runs into a scientifically relevant perspective , we estimate the effects of optical deformations upon ligo s ability to detect gravitational waves from anticipated astrophysical events . focusing here upon gw - sources that might be detectable by the first - generation ligo interferometers , and considering cases for which an improvement in the shot noise limit may significantly increase the number of detection events ( or enlarge the detectable range of some",
    "reasonably well - understood scientific parameter ) , we arrive at two good candidates for study : _ periodic _ gw s from non - axisymmetric pulsars , and _ burst _ gw s from the coalescence of black hole / black hole ( bh / bh ) binaries .      to facilitate comparisons against theoretical signal estimates , the output data from the simulation program are used to create representative interferometer noise curves . to that end",

    "this improvement roughly increases the expected number of pulsar detections ( in a galactic disk distribution ) by @xmath197 , and brings the lookout distance for the detection of even a _",

    "[ fg8 ] , we have plotted the @xmath186 noise curves ( for burst searches ) that are obtained for each of the simulation runs , along with two @xmath187 curves ( with arrows showing time evolution ) , for coalescence events that just manage to skirt the high - detection - confidence threshold of @xmath188 at @xmath196 during the course of their inspirals .",
    "the first conclusion that one may draw from this plot is that ligo s sensitivity to these coalescence events ( at least during inspiral ) is most strongly limited by the _ low frequency _ part of the noise curves , i.e. , the seismic and thermal noise limits . nevertheless , there is a measurable benefit from improving the shot noise limit : judging from the plot , it can be estimated that in going from the @xmath145 case to the perfect mirrors case , the lookout distance is increased from @xmath77125 mpc to @xmath77195 mpc ; or equivalently , it increases the expected number of detectable events by the factor @xmath204 .",
    "the actual rate of bh / bh coalescence events is extremely uncertain ( even their existence is uncertain ) , but good middle - of - the - road values that one could use as benchmarks are the `` best estimates '' that have been made by phinney @xcite , and narayan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which are , respectively : @xmath773 per year out to 200 mpc ( assuming a hubble constant of @xmath205 ) , and @xmath771 per year out to @xmath206 .",
    "thus , the perfect mirrors run appears to put bh / bh binary coalescence events just within the conceivable reach of detection for the first - generation ligo interferometers . perhaps even more significantly ,",
    "improving the shot noise limit could increase ligo s sensitivity to the onset of the merger phase of bh / bh binaries with masses like these ; gw - emission during the actual merger is still poorly understood , but it may involve the most powerful radiation of detectable energy during the overall coalescence process @xcite .",

    "we end this section by cautioning that the aforementioned numbers must be considered very rough estimates , given the highly simplified ways in which we have treated the noise curves of real interferometers , the sophisticated data analysis methods needed to extract signals from the noise , and the many inherent uncertainties about the gw - sources themselves .",
    "in fact , rather than interpreting the results of this section as indicating how ligo _ optics _ would determine initial - ligo _ physics _ , it would be more appropriate to interpret these results as a demonstration of how initial - ligo _ physics _ places requirements on the _ optics_. the firm scientific conclusion that one can draw , however , is that using optical components of the best achievable quality can indeed make a difference in whether or not the first - generation ligo interferometers have a fighting chance to detect gravitational waves from these promising astrophysical sources .",
