    "there has been recent activity in the area of weak - scale supersymmetry , spurred on by a number of suggestive experimental results .",
    "first , there is the single @xmath2 event observed by cdf@xcite .",
    "this particular event does not seem to have a standard model interpretation . also , in supersymmetry , the @xmath3 rate ( @xmath4 ) , the value of @xmath5 extracted from @xmath6 , and the branching ratio for @xmath7 are all affected by loop diagrams containing charginos and stop squarks . at present @xcite , all three of these quantities are 1.52.0@xmath8 from their standard model predictions , each in precisely the directions expected from supersymmetry @xcite if there is a light stop squark .    remarkably , these experimentally independent `` mysteries '' can all be explained by a single reasonably well - determined set of parameters within the framework of weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath2 event has a natural interpretation in terms of selectron pair production .",
    "two different scenarios are possible , depending upon whether the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a gravitino @xcite or higgsino - like neutralino@xcite .",
    "the neutralino and chargino parameters suggested by the second scenario overlap with the values required to account for the @xmath9 difference@xcite , provided that one of the stop squark eigenstates is light ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "one might be concerned that such a low stop mass would have undesirable side - effects .",
    "indeed , an immediate consequence@xcite is that the decays @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lighter of the two stop mass eigenstates and @xmath13 is a kinematically accessible neutralino mass eigenstate should occur with a total branching ratio in the neighborhood of 50% .",
    "the consequences of this depend on how the stop decays .",
    "when at least one chargino is light enough , the decay @xmath14 dominates  @xcite . in this case , the subsequent chargino decay to a fermion - antifermion pair plus neutralino leads to a @xmath15 final state whenever a top undergoes the decay  ( [ toptostopdecay ] ) .",
    "since the final state for the sm decay is identical except for the ( invisible ) neutralinos , there is potential for both direct stop decays as well as top to stop decays to mimic ordinary top decays .",
    "this possibility has been investigated by several authors@xcite .",
    "in particular , we note that sender  @xcite finds that models with a `` large '' @xmath16 have not been ruled out by tevatron data , provided the stop decays according to  ( [ otherdecay ] ) .",
    "this scenario , although interesting , is not the focus of this paper .",
    "instead , we wish to examine the situation where the one - loop decay @xmath17 dominates , which happens when the decay  ( [ otherdecay ] ) is kinematically forbidden  @xcite . in this case , a top undergoing the decay  ( [ toptostopdecay ] ) would produce a @xmath18 final state and be effectively invisible to standard searches .",
    "two independent analyses appropriate to this case have been performed  @xcite which conclude that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is at most 2025% . however , neither analysis accounts for the possibility that supersymmetry can lead to additional sources of top quarks , without the need for stop decays masquerading as top decays  @xcite .",
    "for example , if the gluino is lighter than the other ( non - stop ) squark flavors , but heavier than @xmath21 , then it decays exclusively via  @xcite @xmath22 making the production of gluinos a source of top quarks  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that there is indirect evidence for the decays  ( [ toptostopdecay ] ) , ( [ oneloop ] ) , and ( [ gluinostotherescue ] ) in the fermilab data on top rates and distributions .    in light of the indirect hints at weak scale supersymmetry , it is important to take every opportunity to obtain some direct evidence that nature is indeed supersymmetric , or , to show that it is not .",
    "a discussion of search strategies for the direct production of stop pairs at the tevatron already exists in the literature@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that a stop squark with a mass of up to about 100 gev should be visible at the tevatron in the @xmath23 jets plus missing transverse energy channel given 100 pb@xmath24 of data .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that it is beneficial to augment the direct search with a search for stops coming from top decay : observation of a signal in both channels would greatly boost the case for susy . to this end",
    ", we present a method that may facilitate the search for top to stop decay at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "our method consists of defining a superweight @xmath25 whose function is to discriminate between signal and background events .",
    "the superweight is constructed from various observables in the events so that it is `` large '' for the signal events and `` small '' for the background .",
    "we will illustrate the superweight method using the case of the stops coming from top quark decays ; it can also be applied to stop pair production . although the required analysis is not easy , it should be possible to determine directly whether about half of all tops indeed decay to stops .",
    "our goal in this paper is to help this process .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite have also looked at the problem of searching for stops from top decay at the tevatron .",
    "however , they employ the traditional method of cutting only on the kinematic observables in the event . as a result ,",
    "their signal efficiencies are rather low ( 6%8% ) .",
    "also , they do not include the possibility of susy - induced @xmath26 production .",
    "consequently , they conclude the prospects for observing a signal , if present , are most promising at an _ upgraded _  tevatron .",
    "as we shall see , the superweight method allows us to reduce the backgrounds to a level similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with efficiencies as high as 16% , providing for the possibility of finding a signal in the _ current _  data set .    the d0 experiment at fermilab as well as the various lep experiments have reported limits based upon searches for the pair production of stop squarks  @xcite ( see fig .  [ exclusion ] ) . in the event that the current run at lep finds a stop signal , the confirmation process could be greatly aided by the tevatron data , depending upon the stop and lsp masses . on the other hand , even if lep sees nothing , there is still a significant region in the stop - lsp mass plane to which the tevatron is sensitive and which will not have been excluded by lep .",

    "[ basicsignal ] , within the framework of a simplified model where no other neutralinos are light enough to be produced , and where only sm @xmath26 production mechanisms are considered .",
    "such an analysis is appropriate for any susy model which contains the decays  ( [ toptostopdecay ] ) and  ( [ oneloop ] ) , whether or not there are extra sources of top quarks .",

    "[ fullsignal ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] contains our conclusions ; fig .",
    "[ nevents ] summarizes our results .",
    "in this section we flesh - out the supersymmetric scenario described in the introduction .",
    "specifically , the picture implied by refs .",
    "@xcite contains a higgsino - like neutralino @xmath28 with a mass in the 30 to 55 gev range , a light stop squark with a mass in the 45 to 90 gev range , a gluino with a mass in the 210 to 250 gev range , and @xmath29 squarks in the 225 to 275 gev range .",
    "the `` heavy '' stop eigenstate as well as both @xmath30 squark eigenstates may be heavier .",
    "we further assume that the `` light '' stop eigenstate is lighter than the charginos , and that the gluino is lighter than the squarks ( except for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the stop and the lighter chargino could be approximately degenerate ; we ignore such a complication here .",
    "we take the top quark mass to be 163 gev .    with these masses and couplings ,",
    "the decays and branching ratios relevant to our study are @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 the large variation in the branching ratio for squark decays is a consequence of the relatively small phase space available for producing gluinos ; hence , 2-body decays to the electroweak superpartners are able to compete effectively with the strong decays .",
    "the gluinos , however , have no other 2-body decay modes : if top - stop is open , it dominates .",
    "as indicated by  ( [ threethree ] ) , the total branching ratio for top to all of the kinematically accessible neutralinos is about 50% . in these models",
    ", @xmath35 is the lsp and assumed stable .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath36 which inspired our closer examination of this particular region of parameter space requires @xmath37 in principle , one could look for this photon as an aid in selecting events with @xmath38 .",
    "however , because of the large photino content of the @xmath39 , its production in top decays is suppressed compared to @xmath35 or @xmath40 .",
    "so rather than concentrate on a small fraction of events , we make no attempt to identify the photon in our study , and instead allow it to mimic a jet .",
    "quite often , @xmath40 is also light enough to be produced by decaying tops .",
    "its decays are more complicated : if the sneutrinos happen to be light enough to provide a 2-body channel , then @xmath41 is favored ; otherwise , the 3-body decays @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a light fermion dominate .",
    "the net result is of all of this is that allowing the top to decay to susy states other than @xmath35 simply adds additional ( relatively ) soft jets to the final state .      within the supersymmetric scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are several different production mechanisms for top quarks , and hence many different final states which must be considered .    for the top",
    "pairs produced by the usual sm processes , we end up with mainly three different final states , depending upon the way in which they decay .",
    "firstly , both tops could decay to @xmath44 , according to the standard model . in this case , the final state consists of 2 leptons , 2 jets , and missing @xmath45 ( dilepton ) ; 1 lepton , 4 jets , and missing @xmath45 ( @xmath1 + 4 jets ) ; or 6 jets ( all jets ) .",
    "secondly , one top could decay to @xmath44 , and the other to @xmath46 . in this case , the final state consists of 1 lepton , 2 jets , and missing @xmath45 ( @xmath1 + 2 jets ) ; or 4 jets and missing @xmath45 ( missing + 4 jets ) .",
    "finally , both tops could decay to @xmath46 .",
    "in this case the final state consists entirely of 2 jets and missing @xmath45 ( missing + 2 jets ) .",
    "this last final state is identical to that of direct stop pair production , which is considerably more difficult because of the large standard model multijets background . of the remaining final states coming from supersymmetric sources ,",
    "the @xmath1 + 2 jets mode is the most promising , and the one we will discuss in detail . in our illustrations , we will describe the situation where the top decays to a supersymmetric final state , and the antitop decays according to the standard model : @xmath47 the presence of the charge - conjugated process is always implicitly assumed , and is included in all of the rates reported below .",
    "in addition to  ( [ toptostopsignal ] ) , we must consider the effect of top quarks arising from gluino and squark decays , which , as argued in @xcite , must be present in significant numbers if the non-@xmath44 top quark branching ratio is to be as large as is typical for a light stop .",
    "top quarks produced in this manner are accompanied by extra jets .",
    "consider first the pair production of gluinos .",
    "both gluinos will decay to a top and a stop .",
    "the tops then decay as described above , and the stops each yield a charm jet and a neutralino .",
    "thus , gluino pair production leads to the same final states as top pair production , but with two additional charm jets and additional missing energy . likewise , for the chain beginning with a squark , we pick up an additional jet from the decay  ( [ squarkdecay ] ) . for a summary of conventional gluino physics at fnal ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is useful to examine some kinematical consequences of the scenario we have proposed .",
    "consider first purely sm @xmath26 production at the tevatron , which takes place relatively close to threshold .",
    "we would expect the ordering in @xmath48 of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 jets to reflect fairly accurately the relative sizes of the @xmath51-@xmath1 and @xmath12-@xmath28 mass splittings . for the range of masses we consider here , @xmath52 hence",
    ", the highest @xmath48 jet should come from the @xmath49 quark most of the time .",
    "our simulations confirm this , with the @xmath49 quark becoming the leading jet more than 70% of the time over most of the range of susy masses examined .",
    "[ bfractlego ] shows the results for the kinematically allowed masses in the ranges @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the situation is only slightly worse when we add squark and gluino production .",
    "the additional jets from the cascade decays down to top are rather soft , given the relatively small mass splittings involved .",
    "thus , in the all of the cases we examine here , the identification of the @xmath49 parton with the leading jet is a reasonably good one .    because the jets coming from gluino and squark decays are relatively soft , we will organize our results around the premise that the process  ( [ toptostopsignal ] ) is the framework about which the complications from such decays are relatively small perturbations .",
    "that is , we will first describe the situation as if the only processes going on are the sm backgrounds plus decays of top to stop , parameterized by the stop mass , the lsp mass , and the branching ratio @xmath55 ( sec .",
    "[ basicsignal ] ) .",
    "then , we will expand our consideration to include a full - blown susy model where additional top quarks are being produced by decaying gluinos ( sec .",
    "[ fullsignal ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , the same superweight derived under the simplifying assumptions works well in the more realistic environment .",
    "we now describe a procedure which may be employed to construct a quantity we call the `` superweight '' out of the various observables associated with a given process . in principle",
    ", this procedure may be used to differentiate between signal and background in a wide range of processes , although we will concentrate on the detection of the decay  ( [ toptostopdecay ] ) .    for each event in the data sample passing our selection criteria ( correct number and stiffness of jets , sufficient missing energy , correct number of leptons , _ etc .",
    "_ ) we define a superweight @xmath25 by a sum of the form @xmath56 where the @xmath57 s evaluate to 0 or 1 depending upon whether or not some given criterion is satisfied . the number of terms @xmath58 in the sum defining @xmath25 is arbitrary : one should use as many terms as there are `` good '' criteria .",
    "one could consider a more general form including separate weighting factors for the components and continuous values for the @xmath57 s ( as in a full - blown neural net analysis ) .",
    "however , our intent is to search for new particles over some range of masses and couplings . in such a situation ,",
    "too much refinement could narrow the range of parameters to which the superweight is a good discriminant between signal and background .",
    "furthermore , the components appearing in ( [ suwgtgeneric ] ) are easily given a physical interpretation , which guides us in the optimization of the @xmath59 s .",
    "let us consider a criterion of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is some measurable quantity associated with the event , and @xmath62 is the cut point@xcite .",
    "although we will refer to @xmath62 as a cut point , we do nt actually cut events from the sample which have @xmath63 .",
    "note that  ( [ crit ] ) implies that the value of @xmath59 averaged over the entire sample is exactly the fraction of the cross section satisfying the constraint @xmath64 .",
    "a `` good '' superweight component should have the property that its average for standard model events is much less than its average for susy events .",
    "that is , we want @xmath65 to be as large as possible .",
    "so , to develop a new superweight , one should first devise a set of cuts to produce a data set where the number of background events versus the number of signal events is reasonable ( s : b of order 1:4 , say ) .",
    "next , separate monte carlos of both the signal and main backgrounds should be run , in order to generate plots of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath67 as the fraction of events satisfying @xmath64 may be used as a guide when deciding which @xmath62 s are worth investigating . for each value of the new physics parameters",
    ", there will be an ideal value of @xmath62 for which @xmath68 is maximal .",
    "a good superweight component should not only have a `` large '' value of @xmath68 , but the corresponding value of @xmath62 at that point should be reasonably stable over the entire parameter space to be investigated .",
    "an issue that arises concerns the question of correlations among the @xmath57 s .",
    "our philosophy in this respect is to evaluate the effectiveness of the superweight in terms of how well it separates the signal from the background , _",
    "i.e. _  what is the purity of an event sample with a certain minimum superweight ?",
    "thus , while we avoid using two @xmath57 s whose values are 100% correlated ( on the grounds that doing so is no more beneficial than using only one of the two ) , we do nt worry about using partially correlated @xmath57 s .",
    "the main effect of correlations among the @xmath57 s is that the overall performance of the sum of the @xmath57 s will be less than what is implied by considering the @xmath57 s individually .",
    "thus , to evaluate the effectiveness of a given superweight definition , one should compare the predicted distributions in @xmath25 for the signal and background .",
    "we now give an example of the steps used to determine one of the superweight elements for the @xmath69 search method described in detail in sec .",
    "[ basicsignal ] . to begin ,",
    "we take a moment to recall the definition of the transverse mass .",
    "given particles of momenta @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the transverse mass of the pair is defined by @xmath72 , \\label{transx}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the azimuthal opening angle between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "an important feature of the transverse mass is that if the particles @xmath70 and @xmath71 were produced in the decay of some parent particle @xmath75 , then the maximum value of @xmath76 is precisely the mass of @xmath75 .    as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ features ] , the signal  ( [ toptostopsignal ] ) for top to stop appears in the detector as a charged lepton , 2 jets , and missing energy .",
    "the largest background turns out to be the standard model production of a @xmath1 plus 2 jets , so we determine our superweight criteria using that background . furthermore , we know that for signal events , the leading jet is usually from the @xmath77 quark in the @xmath78 decay",
    ". consequently , most of the time the leading jet and the charged lepton should reconstruct to no more than the top quark mass ( some energy and momentum is carried away by the unseen neutrino ) .",
    "this suggests an upper limit on the value of @xmath79 , which may violated at least some of the time by ordinary @xmath1 plus 2 jet events . in fig .",
    "[ superplot ] , we show the differential cross section in @xmath79 for both the signal and the background , as determined from vecbos@xcite ( relevant details of our simulations will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ basicsignal ] ) .",
    "note that for the signal there is the expected sharp drop - off for large values of @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "[ aaplot ] we show the fraction of events with a @xmath80 transverse mass above @xmath79 , as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "the individual magnitudes of these two curves are not critical in making a good superweight component , but rather the difference in these two curves , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ diffplot ] not only for the masses used in figs .",
    "[ superplot ] and  [ aaplot ] , but also for two additional values as well .",
    "the presence of a dip ranging in depth from about @xmath81 to @xmath82 in the vicinity of @xmath83 for each of the masses used suggests that this is indeed a worthwhile superweight element , and that the criterion should read @xmath84 the key quantities to look for in this evaluation were approximate stability in peak ( dip ) position and `` large '' magnitude for the peak for the range of parameters to be investigated .",
    "narrowness of the peak is not a requirement .",
    "in fact , a broad peak is better , since then the exact placement of the cut point is unimportant .",
    "note also that since we are exploiting the difference in the _ shapes _  of the signal and background distributions , there is no reason we ca nt use an observable both for cutting and in the superweight .",
    "for example , even after requiring a minimum missing transverse momentum , we can ( and do ) still use a superweight criterion based on the shapes of the missing transverse momentum distributions for the surviving events .",
    "our simulations of the signal and backgrounds in this section are based upon tree level matrix elements , with the hard - scattering scale for the structure functions and first - order running @xmath5 set to the partonic center of mass energy . for vector - boson plus jet production ,",
    "we employ vecbos  @xcite running with the structure functions of martin , _ et .",
    "@xcite ( the `` bcdms fit '' ) . for the processes containing top pairs",
    ", we perform a monte carlo integration of the matrix element folded with the hmrs(b ) structure functions  @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the tree - level sm @xmath26 production cross section is 5.1 pb for 163 gev top quarks , while two recent computations of the nlo rate including the effects of multiple soft gluon emission give @xmath86 pb @xcite and @xmath87 pb @xcite for this mass , implying a @xmath88 factor in the 1.4 to 1.6 range .",
    "we refrain from applying any @xmath88 factor to the rates we report below , although the reader may wish to do so . on the the other hand",
    ", we do use a somewhat light value of @xmath89 ( 163 gev ) .",
    "hadronization and detector effects are mocked up by applying gaussian smearing with a width of @xmath90 .",
    "when the simulation of merging jets is called for , we combine final state partons which lie within 0.4 units of each other in @xmath91 space . since",
    "our intent is to demonstrate that the superweight method is viable , we have avoided detailed simulation of the cdf or d0 detectors .",
    "instead , we have tried to capture enough of the general features in order to demonstrate the viability of the method .",
    "of course , the superweight criteria used in an actual analysis should be determined by the experimenters from a complete detector simulation .",
    "there are several ways to mimic our signal of a hard lepton , missing @xmath48 , and two ( or more ) jets within the standard model . the most obvious background process , and the one with the largest raw cross section is the direct production of a @xmath1 plus 2 jets .",
    "however , we can also have contributions from @xmath92 plus 2 jets should one of the leptons be missed by the detector .",
    "furthermore , we must beware of standard model sources of top quarks . in the context of @xmath26 production ,",
    "the dilepton mode can fake the signal if one of the two leptons is lost , which is particularly likely if one of the @xmath1 s decays to @xmath93 . since @xmath94 leptons",
    ", can appear as either a jet of hadrons plus missing momentum ( @xmath95 ) or as a lepton plus missing momentum ( @xmath96 ) , we have been careful to study these backgrounds separately .",
    "the @xmath1 + 4 jets mode is also a potential troublespot , since jets can merge or simply be too soft to be detected .",
    "finally , single top production followed by sm top decay leads to a final state of a @xmath1 , two @xmath97 jets , and missing energy ( plus possibly an extra jet if @xmath1-gluon fusion is the production mechanism ) .",
    "fortunately , the small rate for single tops is effectively dealt with by the cuts described below .",
    "the cuts we impose on the data before embarking on our superweight analysis are listed in table  [ toptostopcuts ] .",
    "the entries above the dividing line are our `` basic '' cuts .",
    "they were inspired by the cdf top analysis@xcite , in order to automatically incorporate some of the coverage and sensitivity limitations imposed by the detector , and to produce a `` clean '' sample of events .",
    "thus we require the lepton to have a minimum @xmath45 of 20 gev , be centrally located ( @xmath98 ) and to lie at least 0.4 units in @xmath99 from the jets ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 cut on the lepton aids in the rejection of taus which decay leptonically .",
    "some discrimination against events with fake missing @xmath48 is obtained by setting a minimum @xmath101 of 20 gev .",
    "the leading two jets should each have a @xmath45 of at least 15 gev , and a pseudorapidity @xmath102 .",
    "all jets must have a minimum separation of 0.4 units in @xmath99 .    to reject standard model @xmath103 events , we require that the third hardest jet have a _ maximum",
    "_ @xmath45 of 10 gev .",
    "while effective in this task , such a cut does have the unwanted side - effect of suppressing signal events containing extra jets , such as those containing squarks and gluinos  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some signal events will contain extra jets because of qcd radiation .",
    "inclusion of either class of events in the data sample requires the relaxation of this cut , as is done in sec .",
    "[ fullsignal ] . here",
    "we note that the data in table  [ nevtfull ] imply that no more than 25% of the signal events contain extra jets above 10 gev in @xmath45 , so the ultra - conservative reader may wish to reduce the signals we report in this section by that amount .",
    "however , since we have neglected a @xmath88 factor of 1.41.6 in our figures , we feel that our values are indeed reasonable .",
    "table  [ toptostopbk ] lists the sources of background discussed above along with the estimated cross section surviving the cuts for each mode .",
    "note that we report the @xmath104 backgrounds as if @xmath105 were unity : the actual contributions to the background in the presence of a signal are smaller by a factor of this branching ratio squared . while the basic cuts are nearly adequate for most of the backgrounds ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath106 jets is still an overwhelming 39.1 pb , necessitating an additional cut . given an ideal detector , the only source of missing momentum in a background @xmath1 + 2 jet event is the neutrino from the decaying @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the transverse mass of the charged lepton and missing momentum ( energy ) must be less than or equal to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "allowing for the finite width of the @xmath1 as well as detector resolution effects , a number of events spill over into higher @xmath107 values .",
    "in contrast , for susy events given by  ( [ toptostopsignal ] ) , the presence of the two neutralinos in addition to the neutrino frequently produces events with a transverse mass well above @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we require that @xmath109 .",
    "this cut is highly effective against the @xmath1 + 2 jets background , while preserving about half of the remaining signal .",
    "it also removes the small contribution from single top production .",
    "however , it is less effective against the @xmath26 backgrounds , especially those containing @xmath94 s . fortunately , those backgrounds are already under control .    when all of our cuts are imposed , the surviving background is about 0.42 pb , nearly 90% of which comes from standard model production of a @xmath1 plus 2 jets .",
    "hence , we consider only that background in developing the @xmath59 s that make up the superweight .",
    "we plot the efficiency for retaining the signal in fig .",
    "[ effhi ] as a function of the stop and lsp masses , and supply numerical values for several representative pairings in table  [ toptostopeff ] .      in table",
    "[ toptostopsuwgt ] we list the 10 criteria used to build the superweight for the process  ( [ toptostopsignal ] ) , in approximate order of decreasing usefulness .",
    "we now provide intuitive explanations for our selections : although the exact placement of the cut points is determined from the monte carlo , we should still be able to understand from a physical point of view why criteria of the forms listed are sensible .",
    "we begin our discussion with the three criteria ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ) which depend on joint properties of the charged lepton ( @xmath113 ) and leading jet ( @xmath114 ) .",

    "since the @xmath49 quark and the charged lepton come from the same parent top quark , not only would we expect an upper limit on the mass of the pair ( @xmath112 , discussed previously ) , but there should be some tendency for the lepton and jet 1 to align . on the other hand , in standard model @xmath1 + 2 jet events , the @xmath1 is recoiling against the two jets , leading to a tendency for the lepton and jet 1 to _ anti-_align .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath110 , which contributes when the @xmath114-@xmath113 azimuthal angle is less than 2.4 radians , and @xmath111 , which contributes when the cosine of the @xmath114-@xmath113 opening angle is greater than @xmath115 .",
    "the next group of criteria ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) are various combinations of the transverse momenta in the event . naturally , we make use of the `` classic '' supersymmetric signature : the missing transverse momentum ( @xmath116 ) , which we require to be at least 65 gev to add one unit to the superweight , that being the point where the two integrated fractions differ the most .",
    "in addition , we make use of the fact that standard model @xmath1 + 2 jets production falls off rapidly with increasing @xmath45 ; that is , we expect the lepton and jets from the signal process to be somewhat harder on average . instead of the individual @xmath45 s",
    ", however , we use their scalar sum with the missing @xmath45 .",
    "admittedly , there are some correlations introduced by this choice ; however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ suwgt ] , that is not important for our purposes .",
    "the remaining criteria ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) may be described as `` miscellaneous . ''",
    "the first of these is tied to the difference between the missing @xmath45 and charged lepton @xmath45 , @xmath123 in standard model events , the neutrino from the decaying @xmath1-boson is the only source of missing momentum . even though the 2-body decay of a polarized @xmath1-boson is not isotropic in its rest frame , we expect little or no net polarization in the @xmath1 bosons produced at the tevatron .",
    "consequently , the distribution in @xmath124 ought to be symmetric about zero : there is no preferred direction for the charged lepton relative to the @xmath1 boost direction . on the other hand , for events with a supersymmetric origin , there are a pair of @xmath28 s in the final state . on average , these neutralinos will tend to increase the mean value of the missing transverse momentum .",
    "hence , we expect that the distribution in @xmath124 will be asymmetric , with a peak for some positive value .",
    "we find that a criterion reading @xmath125 is useful .",
    "earlier , we commented on the use of the transverse mass of the charged lepton and missing @xmath45 for the purpose of reducing the @xmath1 + 2 jets background . among the events satisfying this cut , the distributions _ still _ differ enough to produce a useful superweight criterion : the spectrum of standard model events falls more rapidly than for the susy events .",
    "thus , we select a criterion of the form @xmath126 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the final criterion we employ is the `` visible '' mass , defined by summing the observed 4-momenta of the charged lepton and the leading two jets , and forming an invariant mass - squared . if all of the final state particles were represented by these three objects , then this quantity would be equal to the center of mass energy squared of the hard scattering , that is @xmath127 for the signal , and @xmath128 for the background",
    ". however , not all of the particles are detected : some go down the beampipe , some are too soft , and some are weakly interacting .",
    "we expect the first two kinds of losses to be comparable across signal and background .",
    "in contrast , since the signal events contain two extra weakly - interacting particles ( the @xmath28 s ) , an even larger proportion of the total mass is invisible .",
    "although it is not immediately obvious which way the net effect will go , it is clear that that distributions in this variable should be different . from a study like the one described in sec .",
    "[ suwgt ] , we find that we should set @xmath129 when @xmath130 .",
    "the procedure we have in mind for the detection of top to stop decays is a simple counting experiment .",
    "we apply all of the cuts in table  [ toptostopcuts ] to the data , and evaluate the superweight for each of the surviving events .",
    "our signal consists of an excess of events which have a superweight greater than some value determined by comparing the expected superweight distributions for the signal and background .",
    "we now consider various pieces of data relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of the superweight we have just defined .",
    "[ suwgtsigdist ] shows the distribution of signal events according to their superweight , for the specific masses @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "a significant tendency for signal events to have a high superweight is readily apparent .",
    "[ suwgtlegofig ] presents the mean value of @xmath25 as a function of the stop and neutralino masses for kinematically allowed points in the range @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "note the flatness of this distribution : this implies that our superweight has roughly the same effectiveness over the entire range .",
    "numerical results are presented in table  [ toptostopsuwgttable ] for a few selected points . over the entire range the mean",
    "superweight is in excess of 7 , and typically 75% or more of the events have a superweight of 6 or greater .    of course , the significance of these results depends upon the behavior of the backgrounds .",
    "we plot the superweight distributions for all backgrounds which were estimated to be 1 fb or greater in fig .",
    "[ suwgtbkdist ] , and supply the mean values and fraction of events of each type with superweights of 6 or greater in table  [ toptostopbksuwgttable ] .",
    "it is readily apparent that our criteria were tailored to reject @xmath1 + 2 jets events : they do that very well .",
    "on the other hand , the backgrounds from standard model @xmath26 production do not typically have low superweights .",
    "in fact , their superweight distributions resemble that of the signal .",
    "fortunately , the cross section times branching ratio surviving our cuts for such events is only 0.023 pb ( 0.006 pb if we include the effect of @xmath135 ) , while for most ( but not all ) values of the susy masses , the signal has a cross section 3 to 5 times greater than this particular background .    to get a feeling for the range of masses to which we are sensitive , we present fig .",
    "[ nevents ] , which shows the predicted number of signal events in 100 pb@xmath24 of data , the approximate size of the present cdf and d0 data sets . to guide the eye , we have included the contour where @xmath136 .",
    "we must caution the reader , however , that the exact area in which we can exclude or discover the top squark depends upon a more complete analysis involving full detector simulations and poisson statistics where appropriate .",
    "note that the numbers in fig .",
    "[ nevents ] assume a 50% branching ratio of top to stop ( which is the most favorable case ) .",
    "however , we have omitted the expected increase in rate from the 1loop radiative corrections and summation of multiple soft gluon emission .",
    "furthermore , we have reported @xmath104 backgrounds that do not include the effects of the reduced branching ratio to @xmath44 .",
    "so overall , we believe our numbers to be reasonably conservative . one might hope to increase the signal somewhat by a careful tuning of the cut choices in table  [ toptostopcuts ] and the superweight definition in table  [ toptostopsuwgt ] .",
    "also , in the event that a signal is found , it would be useful to vary the final cut on the superweight , as a check on systematics .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to those of mrenna and yuan  @xcite , who consider the same search , but only employ cuts on the `` traditional '' event observables .",
    "they obtain a background of 1.8 events for 100 pb@xmath24 of data  @xcite , compared to our 4.9 events in the @xmath137 sample .",
    "however , the efficiencies they report for retaining the signal are only in the 6%8% range : our efficiencies are as high as 16% .",
    "the net result is that we have a larger @xmath138 : indeed , their @xmath136 contour would lie somewhere in the vicinity of the @xmath139 contour on our fig .",
    "[ nevents ] .    conspicuously absent from our discussion to this point has been the issue of @xmath97-tagging .",
    "we have avoided using such information so far for two reasons .",
    "first , the efficiency for @xmath97-tagging reported by cdf is currently about 30% per @xmath97 jet@xcite .",
    "hence , the rejection of events without a @xmath97-tag lowers the efficiency significantly .",
    "furthermore , this tagging efficiency implies that a superweight criterion reading @xmath140 only adds about 0.3 units of separation in the mean superweights of the signal and background .",
    "compared to the criteria already in use , this is only a modest separation .",
    "therefore , we would prefer to use @xmath97-tagging to verify that the high superweight events do indeed contain top quarks in the event that a signal is observed .",
    "note that this assessment would change should the tagging algorithms improve : we urge the experimentalists to vary the parameters and criteria in tables  [ toptostopcuts ] and  [ toptostopsuwgt ] to obtain the optimum balance .",
    "finally , given that the susy signal contains both a @xmath97 jet and a @xmath50 jet , we remark that the development of a specific charm - tagging algorithm would be useful in this connection .",
    "in this section we consider our superweight analysis in the context of a `` complete '' susy model .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that the addition of other sources of top quarks can only help in the observability of a signal , if present . at the same time",
    ", we will show that it is indeed sufficient to tune the superweight criteria using the simplified assumptions of sec .",
    "[ basicsignal ] . to illustrate these points ,",
    "we have chosen a specific model which has a stop mass of 65 gev and a lsp mass of 45 gev : we believe this model to be representative of the types of models described in sec .",
    "[ features ] .",
    "we list a few other features of this model in table  [ modelt ] .",
    "the data in this section were generated using pythia 5.7  @xcite with supersymmetric extensions  @xcite .",
    "tree level matrix elements are used , along with the cteq2l structure functions  @xcite .",
    "the square of the hard - scattering scale for the structure functions and first - order running @xmath5 is set to the average of the squares of the transverse masses of the two outgoing particles participating in the hard scattering ( the program default ) . for this choice of calculational parameters , the raw sm @xmath26 production cross section",
    "is reported as 6.8 pb , which is rather close to the nlo estimates .",
    "although we do not do so , the reader may wish to apply a @xmath88 factor of 1.01.2 to the signals we report in this section .",
    "jets are constructed using a cone algorithm ( @xmath141 ) inside a toy calorimeter using the routine supplied by pythia .",
    "no attempt is made to simulate the out - of - cone corrections required to ensure that the jet energy accurately reflects the parton energy .",
    "thus the output systematically underestimates the jet energies . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to directly compare the results appearing in this section with the results from the previous section . in particular",
    ", the efficiencies implied by the data in this section will be lower than what should be expected under actual conditions .",
    "this merely underscores the importance of having each experiment do the analysis with their full detector simulations in place .",
    "our goal in this section is to document the effect of adding susy - induced @xmath26 production mechanisms to the analysis , and so the only direct comparisons we need to make to this end are self - contained within this set of monte carlos .    in order to take advantage of the susy - produced top events , we must relax our cut on the @xmath45 of the third jet .",
    "however , we must beware of the background represented by @xmath1 + 4 jet sm decays of the top . in fig .",
    "[ thirdjet ] we compare the @xmath45 distributions of the third jet for signal ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 jets background , employing the cuts in table  [ toptostopcuts ] _ except _  for the requirement on the third jet .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ thirdjet ] that it is possible to raise the cut on the maximum allowed @xmath45 of the third jet without totally swamping the signal in sm @xmath26 background .",
    "we will present our results for the cases @xmath146 .",
    "table  [ nevtfull ] lists the number of events in 100 pb@xmath24 predicted to pass the cuts in table  [ toptostopcuts ] , as a function of the maximum allowed @xmath45 of jet 3 .",
    "the entries above the dividing line are within the context of our susy model . for the purposes of this study , we define as `` signal '' any event which contains a pair of @xmath147 s in the final state , whether or not it contains a @xmath148 decay .",
    "thus , we list separate entries for @xmath26 events which contain at least one susy decay ( @xmath26 signal ) and those which do nt ( @xmath26 background ) , but do not distinguish between squark and gluino events which do or do not contain tops in the intermediate states .",
    "should a susy scenario of this type prove to be correct and one wanted to study only @xmath148 events , additional work would be required to purify the sample to remove these non-@xmath26 susy `` backgrounds . ''",
    "note that , as expected , for the tightest @xmath149 cut ( 10 gev ) , the squark and gluino channels have little effect on the expected number of events .",
    "however , by relaxing this cut to 30 gev , we allow nearly 2/3 of the @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 events into the sample , with only a modest increase in the background from sm @xmath104 decays .",
    "the entries below the line give the number of counts assuming purely sm @xmath26 production and decay .",
    "for good discriminating power , the cuts on @xmath150 and the superweight should be chosen so that the total number of counts expected with susy is greatly different from the total number of counts expected without susy . since the background from @xmath151 in the absence of a superweight cut ( nearly 40 events ) is significantly larger than the entries in table  [ nevtfull ] , it is necessary to impose such a cut .",
    "[ suwgtfull ] shows the superweight distribution for the signal ( @xmath147-containing ) events .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ suwgtsigdist ] , we see a somewhat broader distribution . however , there is still a significant peaking at high superweight , and the cut @xmath137 still retains the majority of the signal ( 73% in this case ) . hence , we present table  [ nevthi ] , which is the same as table  [ nevtfull ] , but with the additional requirement @xmath137 .",
    "now the @xmath151 background is reduced to the point where , for example , taking the @xmath149 cut to be at 30 gev yields a factor of 2 difference in the number of counts with and without susy .",
    "thus , the prospects for observing or excluding this type of model are quite good .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of detecting a light stop squark in the decays of top quarks using the present fermilab tevatron data set ( approximately 100 pb@xmath24 ) . instead of a traditional analysis which relies on cutting on the kinematic observables individually with a low resultant efficiency ,",
    "we have defined a composite observable , the superweight .",
    "the superweight is assigned event - by - event depending upon how many of the criteria from a predetermined list are true . by construction ,",
    "events with a large superweight are likely to be signal , while those with a small superweight are likely to be background . since we do not require _ all _  of the criterion to be true to accept an event , our efficiency is significantly better ; for example , compared to the analysis of mrenna and yuan  @xcite , our signal efficiencies are typically twice as large . for the given set of cuts and superweight criteria ,",
    "we have shown that the prospects for finding a top - to - stop signal are good .",
    "[ nevents ] can be viewed as a summary of the results .",
    "the collaborations are urged to view this work as a starting point , since a proper analysis must be based upon the actual event reconstruction program used by each experiment .",
    "furthermore , by adjusting the parameters in tables  [ toptostopcuts ] and  [ toptostopsuwgt ] it may be possible to do even better .    finally , we remark that although we have applied the superweight concept to the specific case of a light stop squark in supersymmetric models , the method is applicable in any situation where the individual kinematic cuts required to reduce the background result in a low signal efficiency .",
