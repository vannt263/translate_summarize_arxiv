    "the technique of discovering planets from their photometric transits enables us to probe fainter stars for planetary companions than are accessible to radial velocity surveys .",
    "this allows us to probe a wider variety of stellar environments .",
    "the technique also offers us the possibility of discovering statistically significant numbers of hot jupiter planets from the ground within a relatively short timescale .",
    "such a sample could be used to establish the relationships between planetary formation and key properties such as metallicity , age , etc .",
    "janes ( 1996 ) suggested that clusters would be ideal targets for a transit search .",
    "they provide large numbers of stars within a relatively small area , the ages and metallicities of which can be determined . radial velocity ( rv )",
    "surveys have indicated that stellar metallicity in particular seems to be correlated with the presence of planets .",
    "brown et al . ( 2001 ) reported surveying the globular cluster 47 tuc with the hubble space telescope , but interestingly found no transits . in the light of the rv results ,",
    "this raises the question of whether and how this deficit is related to the low metallicity of the cluster and/or star / radiation density . to address this question",
    ", we are surveying a number of open clusters with a range of ages / metallicities .",
    "open clusters do not suffer from the dense crowding of stars present in globulars and so can be studied with ground - based telescopes .",
    "they are also generally younger and higher in metallicity .",
    "we were awarded 30 nights of bright time on 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) in 1999/06 - 07 and 2000/09 .",
    "the @xmath0 field of view of the wide field camera ( wfc ) is ideal for transit searches .",
    "we observed 3 clusters for the first 20 nights , and one cluster continuously for a further 10 nights .",
    "psf photometry was carried out using _ daophot _ ( stetson 1987 ) while post - processing software was written in - house .",
    "further details of these observations and our data reduction procedures can be found in street et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and street ( 2002 ) .",
    "the 20 nights of data on ngc 6819 have been fully reduced for all 4 ccds , including over 38,000 stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : rmsfigures ] illustrates that we have reached the photometric precision required to detect hot jupiter transits .",
