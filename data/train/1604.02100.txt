    "reconstruction from its sampled measurements is recognized as a fundamental theme of signal processing . under some circumstances ,",
    "these acquired measurements are incomplete due to costly experiments , hardware limitation , or other inevitable reasons .",
    "for example , for the purpose of fast data acquisition , nonuniform sampling is used to obtain partial entries of the time - domain signal in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy @xcite , which has been widely used in chemistry and biology . recovering the full signal is essential for the next step of data analyses in these applications .    in this paper , the signal of interest @xmath2 can be modeled or approximated by a superposition of limited @xmath3 @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath0-d ) exponentials , i.e. , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes a scalar function of @xmath0 variables ; @xmath6 the exponential function for any @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 the complex amplitudes of the associated coefficient .",
    "this formulation implies that each component @xmath0-d exponential in is an exponential function with respect to any variable . in particular , when @xmath12 , @xmath5 denotes a spectrally sparse signal @xcite , i.e. , a superposition of @xmath3 @xmath0-d undamped complex sinusoids .",
    "when @xmath13 with the damping factor @xmath14 , @xmath5 denotes a sum of @xmath3 @xmath0-d damped complex sinusoids .",
    "these two types of signals arise in various applications such as multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radars @xcite , harmonic analysis @xcite , analog - to - digital conversion @xcite , magnetic resonance imaging @xcite , and nmr spectroscopy @xcite . in this paper , we study the problem of reconstructing @xmath0-d exponential signals from a small amount of measurements .        recently , recovering a spectrally sparse signal becomes of great interest in signal processing community @xcite . among emerging approaches ,",
    "the compressed sensing @xcite suggests to reconstruct a signal from its partial observations if it enjoys a sparse representation in some transform domain and the observation operator satisfies some incoherence conditions . the spectrally sparse signal can be sparse in the discrete fourier transform domain if the frequencies are aligned well with the discrete frequencies and the number of exponentials is small . in this case",
    ", signals can be recovered from very few measurements by enforcing the sparsity in the discrete fourier domain @xcite . however",
    ", true frequencies in practical applications generally take values on a continuous domain , and the resultant basis mismatch between the true frequencies and the discretized grid @xcite leads to the loss of sparsity and hence worsens the performance of compressed sensing . for the purpose of addressing this problem ,",
    "total variation or atomic norm @xcite minimization methods were proposed to deal with signal recovery with continuous - valued frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , these methods @xcite work only for undamped complex sinusoids but not for generic exponential signals , such as damped complex sinusoids .",
    "furthermore , being computationally expensive , they search the solution in a space whose dimension is the _ square _ of the dimension of the underlying signal , which is intractable for large scale problems ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "more recently , inspired by matrix pencil method @xcite and matrix completion @xcite , low rank hankel matrix ( lrhm ) reconstruction @xcite has been proposed to recover generic exponential signals . the lrhm was proposed in missing data recovery of non - uniformly sampling in realistic protein nmr spectroscopy @xcite , showing that broad peaks can be recovered much more reliably than minimizing the @xmath15 norm on the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the minimal number of samples for lrhm method is theoretically predicted when the measurements are taken with random gaussian sampling @xcite .",
    "however , lrhm is limited to recovering only 1-d signals .",
    "the @xmath0-d exponential signal is possibly recovered by enhanced matrix completion ( emac ) @xcite with theoretical guarantee of the stable recovery .",
    "nonetheless , emac invokes minimization problems with a huge unknown matrix , prohibiting its applicability to @xmath0-d ( @xmath1 ) exponential signals .",
    "note that the structured matrix based methods @xcite become prohibitive even in the 3-order tensor completion , because they solve the tensor completion problem by lifting to a search space whose dimension is on the order of the square of the dimension of the tensor .",
    "for example , for a signal of size @xmath16 , emac @xcite needs to solve an optimization problem that involves a matrix of size @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , how to recover _ n_-d ( particularly @xmath18 ) exponential signals still remains challenging .",
    "it can be easily checked from that the signal of interest , viewed as an @xmath0-d tensor in the discrete domain , enjoys a low candecomp / parafac ( cp ) rank and a low @xmath7-rank if @xmath3 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , the exponential signal recovery can be formulated as a low - rank tensor completion .",
    "the low - rank tensor completion has been successfully applied to a large class of real - world problems , such as data analyses in computer vision @xcite , remote sensing @xcite , and electroencephalogram @xcite . since the rank of a tensor can be defined differently , there exist several types of low - rank tensor completion approaches , e.g. , the low - cp - rank tensor completion @xcite and the low-@xmath7-rank tensor completion @xcite .",
    "although both low - cp - rank and low-@xmath7-rank tensor completions can be applied to recover _",
    "n_-d ( _ _ n__@xmath193 ) signals , they ignore the specific exponential structure , e.g. time domain signal in nmr spectroscopy , probably causing the requirement of an unnecessarily large number of observed entries for a stable recovery .    in this paper , we propose an approach to reconstruct the @xmath20-d exponential signal satisfying from a small amount of samples .",
    "the proposed approach simultaneously exploits the low - cp - rank structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors ( see the definition in section [ sec : tensorcomp ] ) . to enforce the former structure ,",
    "we represent the signal in the cp decomposition form and imposed a least square fitting to the sampled data . to promote the latter structure , we penalize the nuclear norm of the hankel matrices formed by factor vectors .",
    "we will verify , with comprehensive numerical experiments on simulated and real - world data , the effectiveness of the new method by comparisons with state - of - the - art tensor completion methods .",
