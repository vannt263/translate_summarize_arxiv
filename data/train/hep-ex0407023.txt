    "macro was a large area multipurpose underground detector @xcite designed to search for rare events and rare phenomena in the penetrating cosmic radiation .",
    "the experiment obtained important results on atmospheric @xmath5 oscillations and performed @xmath5 astronomy studies , indirect searches for wimps and searches for low energy @xmath6 from stellar gravitational collapses @xcite .",
    "the detector was located in hall b of the underground gran sasso lab at an average rock overburden of 3700 m.w.e . ; it started data taking with part of the apparatus in @xmath7 ; it was completed in @xmath8 and was running in its final configuration until december 2000 .",
    "the detector had global dimensions of @xmath9 and provided a total acceptance to an isotropic flux of particles of @xmath10 .",
    "the detector was composed of three horizontal layers of liquid scintillation counters , 14 layers of limited streamer tubes and one layer of nuclear track detectors , fig .",
    "vertically it was divided into two parts : the lower part contained 10 layers of streamer tubes , 7 layers of rock absorbers and 2 layers of liquid scintillators ; the upper part was empty , contained the electronics and was covered by 1 layer of scintillators and 4 layers of streamer tubes .",
    "the sides of the detector were covered with 1 layer of scintillators and 6 layers of limited streamer tubes , so as to obtain a closed box structure .",
    "each of the subdetectors could be used in stand - alone  and in combined  mode .    in the following",
    "we shall briefly recall neutrino oscillation formulae and atmospheric neutrinos ; then we shall discuss our main results including the ratio of vertical to horizontal muons and the study of the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "after a detailed analysis of the present situation of the different monte carlos ( mcs ) , we summarize our atmospheric neutrino oscillation results and we conclude with a short discussion of some neutrino astrophysics studies .",

    "we used the neutrino flux computed by the bartol96 group @xcite and the grv94 @xcite parton distribution .",
    "for the low energy channels the cross sections in @xcite were used ; the propagation of muons to the detector was done using the energy loss calculation by lohmann et al . @xcite .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in the predicted flux of upthroughgoing muons , adding in quadrature the errors , was estimated to be @xmath37 ; this is mainly a scale error that does not change the shape of the angular distribution .",
    "the error on the shape of the distribution is @xmath38 .",
    "the detector was simulated using geant @xcite .",
    "a similar mc ( honda96 ) was used by the superkamiokande collaboration @xcite .",
    "recently new improved mc predictions were made available by the honda @xcite and fluka @xcite groups .",
    "they include three dimensional calculations of hadron production and decays and of neutrino interactions , improved hadronic model and new fits of the primary cosmic ray flux .",

    "the inclusion of the new attic collaboration measurements of primary crs seems to lead to the old energy dependence of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "thus the bartol96 mc may probably still be used for the prediction of the absolute flux , besides predicting well the shape of the angular distribution . in the following we shall use mainly the predictions of this mc .",
    "it should be noted that the evidence for neutrino oscillations rests primarely with the shape of the angular distribution and this is the same in all mc calculations .",
    "the _ upthroughgoing muons _ come from @xmath43 interactions in the rock below the detector ; the @xmath43 s have a median energy @xmath44 ; muons with @xmath45 cross the whole detector .",
