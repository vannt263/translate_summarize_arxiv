    "the decay of the h - like ions @xmath0pr and @xmath1pm via electron capture was measured at the gsi storage ring @xcite , where some peculiar oscillations in the decay law were found . in some works @xcite",
    "these anomalies were linked to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations . however ,",
    "this interpretation has been also heavily disputed in other articles , see for instance @xcite .    in this work",
    "we first confirm , by using the lee - hamiltonian formalism @xcite for the study of decays @xcite , that neutrino oscillations can not generate time modulations in the experimental set - up of the gsi experiment .",
    "then , we discuss the emergence of a non - exponential decay law as a consequence of deviations from the breit - wigner energy distribution . indeed , a decay law which presents clear oscillations was measured in the decay thorough tunneling of sodium atoms in an accelerated optical potential @xcite , thus showing that the short - time deviations from the decay law are an experimental fact .",
    "the process under study is schematically given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stays for the @xmath4-like mother state ( such as @xmath0 pr ) and @xmath5 for the daughter nucleus state ( such as @xmath0ce ) .",
    "because of neutrino mixing ( @xmath6 ) one obtains the decay into two channels : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation implies that ( in the first channel ) @xmath9 out of which ( in the reference frame of the mother ) @xmath10 .",
    "a similar expression holds in the second channel .",
    "then , the energy difference is given by @xmath11 .",
    "now , if the decay amplitude _ would _ have an expression of the form @xmath12 then the square amplitude _ would _ read@xmath13 out of which oscillations with period @xmath14 emerge . obviously , this is not a derivation of an oscillation formula . actually , a straightforward calculation of the survival amplitude @xmath15 , as shown in the following , does * not * lead to an oscillatory amplitude of this kind . anyway , it is suggestive that , if we use the present value for the mass difference @xmath16ev@xmath17 @xcite , we obtain ( by setting @xmath18 gev ) @xmath19 s , which is _ remarkably _ close to the measured oscillation period @xmath20 s. this is the reason why neutrino oscillation has been considered appealing , even if it can not hold .",
    "we now turn to the lee - hamiltonian formalism to describe decays @xcite .",
    "this formalism is equivalent to qft at one - loop @xcite ( in most cases a good approximation @xcite ) , hence the correct formalism to describe decays .",
    "the basis of states that we consider is given by @xmath21 where again @xmath22 mother ( in the rest frame ) and @xmath23 daughter .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath24 reads:@xmath25 the state @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) represents a two - particle state , a @xmath5 with momentum @xmath28 and a neutrino with @xmath29 the energies read @xmath30 @xmath31 are coupling constants and @xmath32 are form factors . in the exponential limit , @xmath33 , the time evolution reads:@xmath34 where @xmath35 see e.g. @xcite",
    "the survival probability amplitude of the state @xmath36 is also in this case the usual exponential form @xmath37 , hence the survival probability is @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can calculate the probability that the state has decayed between @xmath41 which is given by @xmath42   = 1-e^{-\\gamma t}=1-p(t)\\text { , } % \\ ] ] where clearly no oscillations exist .",
    "if , instead , we evaluate the probability to measure the final state in a combination corresponding to a neutrino @xmath43 @xmath44 ( for whatever value of @xmath28 ) , we find : @xmath45   .$ ] in general , @xmath46 _ will _ display some oscillations .",
    "their intensity depend on the physical scales of the system .",
    "similarly , we could evaluate the probability to find the final state in the orthogonal combination leading to @xmath47   $ ] .",
    "this expression also leads to oscillations .",
    "but , if we do not distinguish among these two configurations ( because we do not measure neutrinos but only the mother and the daughter states ) we have to perform the sum and re - obtain the standard formula : @xmath48 again , the oscillations disappear . in the end , no matter how one designs the decay s measurement of the mother and the daughter states : neutrino oscillations do not generate time modulations .",
    "in qm the exponential decay is only an ( extremely good ) approximation : deviations are predicted at both short and late times after the creation of the unstable system @xcite .",
    "the very same effect has been confirmed in qft @xcite .",
    "short - time deviations ( related to a residual correlation between unstable system and decay products ) have been clearly demonstrated in cold atoms experiments @xcite , while long - time deviations were measured in molecular decays @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed that a similar deviation occurs in the electron - capture decays of h - like ions due to the particular way in which the energy eigenstate measurement is performed in a storage ring : no measurement on the outgoing neutrino and long - lasting measurement of the daughter nucleus @xcite . as a simple model",
    ", we consider the case in which the form factors @xmath32 generates a breit - wigner @xmath49   ^{-1}$ ] which is cut by a cut - off @xmath50 in an energy window centered a the value of the mass of the unstable system .",
    "the corresponding survival probability @xmath51 shows an oscillating behavior with a period @xmath52 ( see plots in @xcite ) .    in this interpretation , the physical origin of the cutoff is related ( in a non trivial way ) to the time needed to measure the mass of the daughter nucleus , which is of the order of 1sec . during this time interval",
    "the mother nucleus and the decay products are still correlated and can therefore provide significant deviations from the usual exponential decay law . as a consequence , changing the detector would also affect the results ( in particular , a detector with a higher precision in the measurement of time would suppress the signal ) .    within our model",
    "it is not possible to obtain oscillations in @xmath53 decays because the emitted positron is immediately adsorbed within the detector and the correlation between mother and daughter states is broken ( similarly for electron capture decay experiments in which the nuclei are embedded in a metallic matrix @xcite ) .",
    "the not - yet clarified gsi oscillations need experimental verification / falsification . here",
    ", we have shown that neutrino oscillations can not be responsible for them , but that deviations from the exponential decay law offer an interesting possibility .",
    "if the effect shall be confirmed , the microphysics of the measurement process specifically used in the gsi experiment needs to be theoretically modelled in a better way ."
