    "topological materials have become a primary target of research in the last few years due to their exceptional properties with high potential for applications @xcite .",
    "the bulk - edge correspondence and the topological protection of edge states is on the basis of the interesting properties of systems with topologically non - trivial band structure . in topological insulators ,",
    "the quantity controlling the topological protection is the inverted gap between bands arising from the crystal structure of the material .",
    "a perturbation must be strong enough to close the gap in order to destroy the edge states of the material .    in band theory ,",
    "a semimetal is usually defined as a material with no gap in the band structure but with a very small overlap between the valence and the conduction band , resulting in a small density of states around the fermi energy .",
    "a typical example is bismuth which has intermediate properties between an insulator and a metal @xcite . in topological band theory , however , it is customary to work with a more strict definition by which a semimetal is a material with no gap but also no fermi surface , so the conduction and valence bands touch only at isolated points .",
    "the semimetal so defined is really a distinct phase intermediate between insulators and metals , the most famous example being graphene @xcite .",
    "although the dirac nodes in the 2d brillouin zone of graphene are not topologically protected , in three dimensions we have the last additions to the family of topological materials , which include dirac and weyl semimetals with isolated dirac or weyl nodes in the band structure @xcite , and the nodal - line semimetals with a continuous line of nodes in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the surface states corresponding to these topological semimetals lie on constant energy contours which do not form in general closed curves . in the case of the weyl and dirac semimetals ,",
    "the surface states lead to the celebrated fermi arcs joining the projection of the nodes onto the given surface . for nodal - line semimetals ,",
    "the surface states form the so - called drumhead within the nodal circle @xcite . in the weyl semimetals , such states are topologically protected and chern numbers can be defined in the planes lying between weyl nodes @xcite . the physical quantity measuring this protection is the separation of the nodes in momentum space .",
    "the situation is less clear for dirac semimetals in which a simple application of bulk - surface correspondence does not provide with an answer to whether or not the surface states are topologically protected .",
    "recent works have discussed the stability of the surface states in 3d semimetals @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "an alternative description of the topological protection of surface states in 3d topological semimetals is very desirable . here",
    ", we provide such a description by extending the band structure in momentum space to complex momenta .",
    "the convenience of taking complex values of the momentum is motivated by the search of evanescent states in the 3d semimetals . when the momentum is promoted to a complex quantity ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system becomes non - hermitian , but it is still possible to find exceptional points in the spectrum , that is , branch points where the imaginary part of the eigenvalue vanishes .",
    "this allows one to identify the set of evanescent states with complex momentum that signals the decay into the 3d semimetal .",
    "such states are endowed with topological protection , which arises naturally from the fact they are attached to branch cuts that can not be removed under small perturbations .",
    "this description based on the identification between evanescent states and exceptional points was pioneered in a previous work describing surface states in weyl semimetals in the presence of circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "recently , rings of exceptional points have been also found in dissipative systems which are based on weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "when looking for evanescent states in the spectrum of the 3d semimetals , we have found that these can be classified in two different groups , depending on the pattern of the branch cuts in the plane of complex momentum .",
    "thus , there is a class of 3d semimetals , that we denote as type a , where most part of the branch cuts run in parallel crossing the real axis .",
    "the corresponding exceptional points form then quartets belonging to the same branch of the spectrum , with each member of a quartet in a different quadrant of the complex plane . in the other class ,",
    "that we denote as type b , all the branch cuts can be disposed instead along the imaginary axis , lacking the nontrivial realization of symmetry found in the type a class . from the physical point of view",
    ", this introduces also an important difference between the two classes , as the quartets found in the type a semimetals provide a higher degree of topological protection , quantified in terms of a larger length of the branch cuts and a much smaller penetration length of the evanescent states in the 3d semimetal .    note that this classification has a different origin than the classification into type i and type ii weyl semimetals , that depends on whether the density of states vanishes at the nodal points or has some extra contributions due to the tilting of the weyl nodes @xcite .",
    "although we have only explored a model describing a type i weyl semimetal in this work , we expect our classification to be supplementary to the classification into type i and type ii weyl semimetals , that is , we expect to be type a semimetals of type i and type ii and type b semimetals also of both type i and ii .",
    "the stability of the surface states stems in our approach from the complex structure that develops for complex momentum , where different bands can be seen as different branches of the riemann surface giving the spectrum . in this framework ,",
    "a pair of exceptional points and the respective evanescent states can be only annihilated by merging the branch points , provided they lie in the same branch of the spectrum .",
    "this picture allows us to establish a connection with the usual account of the topological protection of surface states , which requires making a 2d projection of the 3d band structure to open a gap in the spectrum . in our approach",
    "a gap also exists , but this is now seen as the separation opened between different branches along a branch cut in the complex spectrum .",
    "such a gap can be closed only as long as the exceptional points at the two ends of the branch cut are made to coalesce , which provides an alternative understanding of the topological protection in the plane of complex momentum .    in this paper",
    "we apply the complex structure developed around the exceptional points to investigate the stability of the surface states in 3d weyl and nodal - line semimetals .",
    "we are going to see that this approach provides a very robust picture of the evanescent states in these systems .",
    "this will be checked in particular in the case of the nodal - line semimetals under circularly polarized light , which is an instructive example since that may not be in general a small perturbation of the semimetal .",
    "we will see that the exceptional points survive indeed the effect of the electromagnetic field , though appropriate boundary conditions for surface states can not be satisfied in general due to the breakdown of time - reversal invariance by the radiation field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : weyl ] , we consider weyl semimetals and their surface states on the light of our approach to look for evanescent states with complex momentum .",
    "then , in sec .",

    "[ sec : nodalfloquet ] , we use the same approach to study the behavior of evanescent states in the case of a periodic perturbation of the nodal - line semimetal by circularly polarized light .",

    "we consider a simple model for a weyl semimetal with hamiltonian @xmath0 the energy - momentum dispersion as a function of the 3d momentum @xmath1 is given then by @xmath2 it turns out that the valence and conduction bands touch at weyl points located in the line @xmath3 with @xmath4    in this model we may look for surface states characterized by wavefunctions decaying for instance in the @xmath5 direction as @xmath6 with @xmath7 corresponding to the inverse of the penetration length . the action of the hamiltonian becomes particularly simple if we concentrate on the set of states @xmath8 with the spinor part corresponding to the eigenvectors of @xmath9 @xmath10 we get in this way    @xmath11    then we can identify a collection of zero - energy modes in the set of states @xmath12 by canceling out the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "we note that the actual wave function corresponding to a surface state must be a linear combination of the solutions with @xmath18 and @xmath19 signs ( in either ( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) or ( [ c3])-([c4 ] ) ) in order to fulfill appropriate boundary conditions ( for example in a semi - infinite plane , making the wave function to vanish at @xmath20 ) .",
    "this collection of evanescent states maps therefore the celebrated fermi arcs with @xmath21 , which join the projection of the weyl points onto a given surface of the semimetal .    the solution corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) is valid when @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", there is however a portion of the fermi arcs , closer to the endpoints , where the states change to the form given by eqs .",
    "( [ c3])-([c4 ] ) . in the regime @xmath23",
    ", all the states in the fermi arcs correspond instead to this latter representation of the evanescent eigenstates . in what follows",
    ", we will see that there is indeed a clear distinction between two different types of surface states , allowing us to discern two different regimes of weyl semimetals that we denote as type a ( for @xmath22 ) and type b ( for @xmath23 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermiarcs ] we show numerical calculations for an equivalent tight - binding hamiltonian in a slab of width @xmath24 nm in the @xmath5 direction , for two different examples pertaining to type a and type b semimetals .",
    "the appearance of the band structure is very similar in the two regimes , with the fermi arcs joining the projection of the weyl nodes .",
    "however , in the type b regime ( @xmath25 ) the fermi arc states have a penetration length ( 1/@xmath26 ) that increases with the value of @xmath27 until it diverges at the projection of the weyl nodes . in the type a regime ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the states with @xmath29 have a very small penetration length @xmath30 which would be typically of the order of a few unit cells in real materials . however , the probability density oscillates as it decays . for larger values of @xmath31 ,",

    "we compare two different cases , one with some oscillatory dependence in the @xmath5 direction corresponding to a type a weyl semimetal ( red line , @xmath33 ev , @xmath34 ev nm@xmath35 , @xmath36 ev nm ) and another with pure exponential decay corresponding to a type b weyl semimetal ( black line , @xmath33 ev , @xmath34 ev nm@xmath35 , @xmath37 ev nm ) . in the inset the same figure is shown in normal scale .",
    "[ fig : fermiarcs ] , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    within this approach , we can also analyze the role that the evanescent states play in the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath38 , as this becomes a non - hermitian operator acting on the basis ( [ b1])-([b2 ] ) . in the subspace spanned by this set of states , the eigenvalues of",
    "@xmath38 turn out to be according to ( [ zm1])-([zm2 ] ) @xmath39 it can be seen that the particular values satisfying the zero - mode conditions ( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) and ( [ c3])-([c4 ] ) correspond to branch points in the complex spectrum of @xmath38 , both for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we find therefore that the evanescent states we have identified correspond to so - called exceptional points @xcite in the spectrum of @xmath38 , when this is mapped as a function of the complex momentum @xmath42 .",
    "this highlights that there is a complex structure behind the surface states of the weyl semimetals , which has important implications for their stability .",
    "the structure of the branch cuts in the complex plane @xmath43 is different however , depending on whether we consider the type a regime ( @xmath44 or the type b regime ( @xmath41 ) of the weyl semimetal . in the first case",

    "the branch cuts fall eventually into the imaginary axis for @xmath45 , where we know that the evanescent states must be in accordance with ( [ c3])-([c4 ] ) . in the type b regime , however , the branch cuts are found in the imaginary axis for all the states in the fermi arcs , with a typical structure represented in fig .",
    "[ oneb ] .     +    ( a )    ( b )    the different structure of the branch cuts in the type a and type b regimes of the weyl semimetal can be actually ascribed to a different realization of the symmetries of the hamiltonian ( [ hw ] ) .",
    "this is in particular invariant under the spatial inversion , which can be represented as an operator @xmath46 with an action on the states @xmath47 given by @xmath48 the hamiltonian ( [ hw ] ) has moreover an enlarged symmetry when the dynamics is constrained to states that do not depend on the @xmath49 coordinate , as in the above discussion .",
    "then @xmath38 becomes invariant under a transformation @xmath50 that acts like time - reversal invariance , given in terms of the operation of complex conjugation @xmath51 as @xmath52 thus , in the structure represented in fig .",
    "[ one ] for the type a regime of the weyl semimetal , the two branch points related by the inversion of the complex momentum @xmath42 correspond to states that are mapped onto each other by the action of @xmath46 . on the other hand , the transformation @xmath50 is realized in the complex plane as the inversion @xmath53 .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the same state @xmath47 ( with @xmath54 ) is found at the two branch points related by such an inversion of the momentum @xmath55 .",
    "+    ( a )    ( b )    the fact that one finds the same evanescent state at branch points with momenta @xmath55 and @xmath56 is important from the point of view of the stability of the surface states .",
    "as already mentioned , two independent states @xmath47 are needed in order to build a surface state that may vanish on the boundary of the system , say for instance on the plane @xmath20 .",
    "this requirement can be satisfied in the type a regime of the weyl semimetal from the symmetry enforced by the @xmath50 operation .",
    "then , the surface states with @xmath57 turn out to be protected due to the particular structure of the branch cuts , which can not be undone unless the branch points are made to coalesce in pairs .",
    "such kind of topological protection holds also but to a lesser degree in the type b regime of the weyl semimetal . in that case",
    ", the evanescent states correspond to branch points with more variable separation along the imaginary axis , which can merge therefore under weaker perturbations .",
    "we find that the exceptional points endow in general the surface states with topological protection , as the nontrivial topology of the branch cuts can not be modified with small perturbations . when the exceptional points realize the @xmath46 and @xmath50 symmetry operations , that protection can be also quantified in terms of the distance separating each pair in a quartet of exceptional points .",
    "alternatively , this protection can be also understood from the existence of a gap that opens up along each branch cut , as observed in figs .",
    "[ one ] and [ oneb ] , though here we realize that this is just an effect of a more involved picture relying on the full complex structure unveiled in the @xmath58 plane .",

    "we are interested in surface states that take the form of evanescent waves localized at the boundary of the 3d semimetal .",
    "it can be easily seen that there is a huge set of these states characterized by the evanescence in the @xmath5 direction , with wavefunction @xmath73 decaying as @xmath74 the zero - energy modes have to correspond in particular to solutions of the equation    @xmath75 \\sigma_z \\chi_{k_z}^{(m ) }         + v ( k_z + i\\alpha ) \\sigma_x \\chi_{k_z}^{(m ) }   =   0 \\label{ev2}\\ ] ]    first of all , the imaginary terms must cancel out in ( [ ev2 ] ) .",

    "if we choose otherwise the second spinor in ( [ sp ] ) , that changes the sign of the last term in the left - hand - side of ( [ ev2 ] ) , which prevents the existence of evanescent states with @xmath57 ( for @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) and does not allow either to find solutions with @xmath7 when @xmath62 ( as we see in what follows ) .",

    "this disjunctive allows us to distinguish between two different classes of nodal line semimetals , that we denote as type a ( for @xmath88 ) and type b ( for @xmath89 ) .",
    "the type a corresponds to the regime that is expected to hold for realistic materials providing examples of nodal line semimetals . from the physical point of view ,",
    "the two classes a and b can be discerned by the different penetration of the drumhead surface states into the material , which shows for a slab practically the same behavior as represented in the case of the weyl semimetal in fig .",

    "[ one].,title=\"fig:\",height=207 ] ( b )    we have to remark however that , in the present case , the exceptional points we have found do not imply the existence of zero - energy surface states attached to a given boundary of the nodal line semimetal .",
    "this is so as the evanescent eigenstates of @xmath113 do not realize the symmetry required to build appropriate linear combinations that may guarantee the vanishing of the surface states at the boundary , say at @xmath20 . in the case of the unperturbed nodal line",
    "semimetal , we saw above that the crucial symmetry for the existence of zero - energy surface states was given by the @xmath50 operation in ( [ tr ] ) .",
    "the introduction of the radiation field breaks the time - reversal invariance , which explains that the evanescent modes corresponding to momenta @xmath55 and @xmath123 have different wave functions at @xmath20 in the presence of the radiation .",
    "this stresses the significance of the symmetry of the hamiltonian to guarantee the stability of the zero - energy surface states , together with the topological protection already provided by the existence of the exceptional points in the spectrum .",
    "we have shown how the surface states in topological semimetals are associated to exceptional points of the spectrum in the extension of the brillouin zone to complex values of momenta .",
    "these exceptional points are very robust under perturbations of the hamiltonian as they can be only annihilated by merging them in pairs to close the branch cuts in the spectrum .",
    "this draws a useful way of understanding the topological protection of evanescent states like those forming the fermi arcs in weyl semimetals or the drumhead states in nodal line semimetals . in this regard ,",
    "the mechanism of topological protection seems to be rather different to that of the nodes of the semimetals themselves ( and different also to that studied recently in the case of 3d dirac semimetals @xcite ) .",
    "we have also shown that the evanescent states decay exponentially into the semimetal , and we have illustrated the dependence of the penetration length according to the parameters of a model hamiltonian for both weyl and nodal line semimetals .",
    "the penetration into the semimetal can be very short and oscillating , or longer and with pure exponential decay , depending on the ratio between the linear and the quadratic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "according to this ratio , we have classified the topological semimetals as type a or type b. although we expect the type a ( the short penetration with oscillations ) to be realized in real materials , the proposals for artificial topological semimetals in photonic or cold atom setups could easily reach both regimes @xcite .",
    "the distinction between type a and type b is also formally related to the different way in which the branch cuts corresponding to the exceptional points are arranged in the complex plane .    in nodal line semimetals ,",
    "we have also studied the effect of an external ac field on the surface states .",
    "evanescent states with different angular momentum are mixed by the external field .",
    "interestingly , the resulting states are still in correspondence to exceptional points in the complex plane and they are protected from small perturbations as such . these mixtures of states with different angular momenta should carry a rotating current similarly to that studied before in weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "however , the reduction of symmetry from the ac field implies that the zero - energy surface states of nodal line semimetals are in general not stable in the presence of radiation , as this breaks the required invariance to comply with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we believe our work paves the way for an alternative understanding of topological protection of edge states in gapless systems , based on the extension of the band structure for complex values of the momenta . in this complex momentum space ,",
    "the surface states arise as exceptional points , making possible to study their stability by discerning the perturbations capable to close the branch cuts in the complex band structure .",
    "it would be an interesting future avenue to investigate the connection between this description of surface states and the topological properties of photonic materials or open quantum systems that can be described by actual non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite .",
