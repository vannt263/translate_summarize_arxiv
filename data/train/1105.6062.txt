    "the starting point of this paper has been an intriguing conjecture in  @xcite on the weak lefschetz property of certain algebras .",
    "though the presence of this property implies considerable restrictions on invariants of the algebra , many algebras are expected to have the weak lefschetz property . however , establishing this property is often rather difficult . in this paper",
    "we make progress on the above conjecture and illustrate the depth of the problem by considering a larger class of algebras and relating the problem to _ a priori _ seemingly unrelated questions in combinatorics and algebraic geometry .",
    "this builds on the work of many authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) .    throughout this work we consider in particular the question of how the weak lefschetz property of a certain @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 depends on the characteristic of the field @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by relating the algebra @xmath1 to two square integer matrices , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the entries of @xmath2 are binomial coefficients and @xmath3 is a zero - one matrix . we show that @xmath1 has the weak lefschetz property if and only if the determinant of either of these matrices does not vanish modulo the characteristic of @xmath0 .",
    "next , we establish that the determinant of @xmath2 enumerates signed lozenge tilings of a punctured hexagonal region and that the determinant of @xmath3 enumerates signed perfect matchings of a bipartite graph associated to the same punctured hexagonal region .",
    "the relation to the weak lefschetz property implies that both determinants have the same prime divisors ; in fact , we show that their absolute values are the same by using combinatorial arguments .",
    "finally , we show that in certain cases deciding the presence of the weak lefschetz property is equivalent to determining the splitting type of some semistable rank three vector bundles on the projective plane .",
    "we now describe the contents of this paper in more detail .",
    "let @xmath4 $ ] be the standard graded @xmath5-variate polynomial ring over the infinite field @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 be a standard graded @xmath0-algebra over @xmath6 .",
    "we say @xmath1 is _ artinian _ if @xmath1 is finite dimensional as a vector space over @xmath0 .",
    "further , an artinian @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 is said to have the _ weak lefschetz property _ if there exists a linear form @xmath7_1 $ ] such that , for all integers @xmath8 , the multiplication map @xmath9_d \\rightarrow [ a]_{d+1}$ ] has maximal rank , that is , the map is injective or surjective .",
    "such a linear form is called a _ lefschetz element _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the weak lefschetz property has been studied extensively for many reasons , especially for the relation to the hilbert function ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "a convenient way to encode the hilbert function of an artinian @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 is the _ @xmath10-vector _ , a finite sequence @xmath11 of positive integers @xmath12_i}$ ] .",
    "using this notation , one immediate consequence ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  3.3 ) ) of @xmath1 having the weak lefschetz property is that the @xmath10-vector of @xmath1 is _",
    "strictly unimodal_. further , the positive part of the first difference of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is any lefschetz element of @xmath1 .",
    "the weak lefschetz property is known to be subtle to both deformations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) but also to field characteristic .",
    "the latter , considering the weak lefschetz property in positive characteristic , is an exciting and active direction of research .",
    "migliore , mir - roig , and the second author  @xcite , as well as zanello and zylinski  @xcite , began explorations into the connection between the weak lefschetz property and positive characteristic , and also posed several interesting questions .    in  @xcite , the authors found a connection between certain families of level artinian monomial almost complete intersections and lozenge tilings of hexagons ; independently , li and zanello  @xcite found a similar connection for artinian monomial complete intersections ( see also corollary  [ cor : ci ] ) .",
    "however , both were without combinatorial bijection until one was found by chen , guo , jin , and liu  @xcite ; boyle , migliore , and zanello  @xcite have pushed this connection further .",
    "brenner and kaid  @xcite also consider artinian monomial complete intersections in three variables with generators all of the same degree .",
    "we also note that in their study of pure @xmath16-sequences boij , migliore , mir - roig , the second author , and zanello  @xcite have explored the relation between the weak lefschetz property and pure @xmath16-sequences .    in this paper",
    "we extend the connection found by chen , guo , jin , and liu to a connection between artinian monomial almost complete intersections in three variables and lozenge tilings of more general regions that we call punctured hexagons . in section  [ sec : toolchain ]",
    "we gather a few useful tools for dealing with the weak lefschetz property . in section",
    "[ sec : aci ] we introduce the algebras we are interested in : artinian monomial almost complete intersections in three variables .",
    "if the syzygy bundle is not semistable , then the algebra has the weak lefschetz property in characteristic zero ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we focus on the algebras that have semistable syzygy bundles , which we classify numerically ( proposition  [ pro : semistable ] ) .",
    "then we prove that such an algebra has the weak lefschetz property if and only if a particular map between the peak homogeneous components of the algebra is a bijection ( corollary  [ cor : one - map ] ) . using this",
    ", we show that to each of the studied algebras @xmath1 we can associate a zero - one matrix @xmath17 such that @xmath1 has the weak lefschetz property in positive characteristic @xmath18 if and only if @xmath18 is not a prime divisor of the determinant of @xmath17 ( proposition  [ pro : wlp - zero - one ] ) .",
    "we also describe a matrix @xmath19 with binomial entries that also has the analogous property ( proposition  [ pro : wlp - binom ] ) .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that a rather simple algebraic argument can be used to determine some of the prime divisors of the determinants for both @xmath17 and @xmath19 ( proposition  [ pro : wlp - p ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : ph ] we organise the monomials generating the peak homogeneous components of such an algebra in a plane .",
    "it turns out that the monomials fill a punctured hexagon ( theorem  [ thm : interlace - amaci ] ) . using the well - known bijection between lozenge tilings and non - intersecting lattice paths , and the lindstrm - gessel - viennot theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) on non - intersecting lattice paths ,",
    "we show that the determinant of the binomial matrix @xmath19 is the enumeration of the signed lozenge tilings of the punctured hexagon , up to sign ( theorem  [ thm : nilp - matrix ] ) .",
    "furthermore , using another well - known bijection between lozenge tilings and perfect matchings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we argue that the determinant of the zero - one matrix @xmath17 is an enumeration of the signed perfect matchings of the associated bipartite graph , up to sign ( theorem  [ thm : bip - matrix ] ) .    in section  [",
    "sec : signs ] we use the aforementioned connections to show that the determinant of the zero - one matrix @xmath17 and the binomial matrix @xmath19 are the same , up to sign ( theorem  [ thm : det - z - n ] ) .",
    "moreover , in a special case of kasteleyn s theorem  @xcite about enumerating perfect matchings , when the puncture has an even side - length , then the determinant and the permanent of @xmath17 are also the same , up to sign ( corollary  [ cor : det - z - per - z ] ) .    in section  [ sec : det ]",
    "we prove first that the determinant of @xmath19 is non - zero when the puncture is of even side - length ( theorem  [ thm : m - even ] ) , thus establishing the weak lefschetz property in many new cases .",
    "we then find closed formulae for the determinants when the puncture is trivial ( proposition  [ pro : m - zero ] ) , when any one side of the hexagonal region has length zero ( proposition  [ pro : c - zero ] ) , when a vertex of the puncture touches one of the sides of the region ( proposition  [ pro : c - maximal ] ) , and when a side of the puncture touches one of the sides of the region ( proposition  [ pro : gamma - zero ] ) .",
    "we close with a complete description of when the region is symmetric .",
    "in particular , we show that when certain parity conditions hold the determinant is zero ( proposition  [ pro : symmetry - zero ] ) and we provide a conjecture for a closed formula of the determinant when the same parity conditions fail ( conjecture  [ con : symmetry ] ) .    in section  [ sec : central ]",
    "we explore two different ways to centralise the puncture .",
    "we call the puncture _ axis - central _ when it is central along each of the three axes , independently .",
    "using very involved computations , ciucu , eisenklbl , krattenthaler , and zare  @xcite found closed formulae for the enumerations and signed enumerations of regions with an axis - central puncture ; therein axis - central is called simply `` central '' .",
    "we use these closed formulae to describe the permanents of the zero - one matrices @xmath17 ( corollary  [ cor : axis - central - perm - z ] ) and the determinants of both matrices ( corollary  [ cor : axis - central - det - z ] ) , @xmath17 and @xmath19 , when the puncture is axis - central .",
    "we call the puncture _ gravity - central _ when its vertices are equidistant from the sides of the containing hexagon ; this condition is equivalent to the associated algebra being level , that is , its socle is concentrated in one degree . using this observation we provide further evidence for a conjecture by migliore , mir - roig , and the second author  @xcite about the presence of the weak lefschetz property for level artinian monomial almost complete intersections in characteristic zero ( proposition  [ pro : level - wlp ] )",
    ".    in section  [ sec : interesting ] we describe a method , for any positive integer @xmath5 , to generate a subfamily of algebras whose associated matrices have determinant @xmath5 ( proposition  [ pro : det - n ] ) . from this",
    "we generate a subfamily of algebras which _ always _ have the weak lefschetz property , regardless of the field characteristic ( corollary  [ cor : c - zero - unique ] ) ; we also describe a different subfamily of algebras which always have the weak lefschetz property ( proposition  [ pro : gamma - zero - unique ] ) .",
    "moreover , we describe the unique algebras which retain certain properties yet have minimal multiplicity ( example  [ exa : minimal - multiplicity ] ) .    in section  [ sec : splitting - type ]",
    "we explicitly determine ( in one case , depending on the presence of the weak lefschetz property ) the splitting type of all artinian monomial almost complete intersections .",
    "in particular , we consider separately the cases when the syzygy bundle is non - semistable ( proposition  [ pro : st - nss ] ) and semistable ( propositions  [ pro : st - nmod3 ] and  [ pro : st - mod3 ] ) . moreover , in the case of ideals associated to punctured hexagons , we relate the weak lefschetz property to a number of other problems in algebra , combinatorics , and algebraic geometry ( theorem  [ thm : equiv ] ) .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ sec : hyper - calculus ] we provide a technique , a `` picture - calculus '' , for working with hyperfactorials , a basic unit for the aforementioned closed formulae .",
    "we demonstrate that several nice polynomials can be written as ratios of products of hyperfactorials ( proposition  [ pro : hyper - f ] and corollary  [ cor : hyper - eo - f ] ) .",
    "further , this shows that macmahon s formula for the number of lozenge tilings of a ( non - punctured ) hexagon is a polynomial in one of the side - lengths when the other two are fixed ( corollary  [ cor : mac - poly ] ) .",
    "let @xmath4 $ ] be the standard graded @xmath5-variate polynomial ring over the infinite field @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 be an artinian standard graded @xmath0-algebra over @xmath6 .",
