    "these are expanded notes of a minicourse of three lectures given at the euroconference ` homological invariants in representation theory ' in ioannina , greece , march 16 to 21 , 1999 , and of a talk at the instituto de matemticas , unam , mxico , on april 28 , 1999 .",
    "they present basic results on @xmath0-algebras , their modules and their derived categories .",
    "@xmath0-spaces and @xmath0-algebras (= sha algebras = strongly homotopy associative algebras ) were invented at the beginning of the sixties by j.  stasheff @xcite @xcite as a tool in the study of ` group - like ' topological spaces . in the subsequent two decades , @xmath0-structures found applications and developments @xcite @xcite @xcite in homotopy theory ; their use remained essentially confined to this subject ( cf .",
    "however @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this changed at the beginning of the nineties when the relevance of @xmath0-structures in algebra , geometry and mathematical physics became more and more apparent ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "of special influence was m.  kontsevich s talk @xcite at the international congress in 1994 : inspired by k.  fukaya s preprint @xcite kontsevich gave a conjectural interpretation of mirror symmetry as the ` shadow ' of an equivalence between two triangulated categories associated with @xmath0-categories .",
    "his conjecture was proved in the case of elliptic curves by a.  polishchuk and e.  zaslow @xcite .      in these notes",
    ", we aim at presenting some basic theorems on @xmath0-algebras , their modules and their derived categories .",
    "the notes may serve as an introduction to a ( very ) small part of kontsevich s lectures  @xcite .",

    "some of the results we state are not proved in this form in the literature .",
    "complete proofs will be given in @xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we motivate the introduction of @xmath0-algebras and modules by two basic problems from homological algebra :    * the reconstruction of a complex from its homology , * the reconstruction of the category of iterated selfextensions of a module from its extension algebra",
    ".    then we briefly present the topological origin of @xmath0-structures .",
    "section 3 is devoted to @xmath0-algebras and their morphisms .",
    "the central result is the theorem on the existence of minimal models . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we introduce the derived category of an @xmath0-algebra and we present the natural framework for the solution of problem 1 . in section 6 , we sketch the formalism of standard functors and arrive at the solution of problem 2 . section 7",
    "presents the category of twisted objects , which is of importance because it is ` computable ' .",
    "the links with morita theory for derived categories @xcite or dg categories @xcite have not been made explicit , cf .",

    "let @xmath1 be a field .",
    "the following two problems will guide us in our exploration of the world of @xmath0-algebras and modules .",
    "* problem 1 .",
    "*    let @xmath2 be an associative @xmath1-algebra with @xmath3 , let @xmath4 be a complex of ( unital right ) @xmath2-modules and let @xmath5 be its homology .",
    "it is a naive but natural question to ask whether , up to quasi - isomorphism , we can reconstruct the complex @xmath6 from its homology @xmath7 .",
    "this is of course impossible , except under very restrictive hypotheses , for example when @xmath2 is an hereditary algebra ( i.e. an algebra such that submodules of projective @xmath2-modules are projective , see @xcite ) .",
    "so we ask _ what additional structure is needed if we want to reconstruct @xmath6 from its homology_. the answer is that _",
    "@xmath7 carries a unique ( up to isomorphism ) @xmath0-module structure over @xmath2 ( viewed as an @xmath0-algebra ) which encodes exactly the additional information needed for this task_.    * problem 2 .",
    "*    let @xmath8 be an associative @xmath1-algebra with @xmath3 , let @xmath9 be @xmath8-modules and let @xmath10 denote the full subcategory of the category of right @xmath8-modules whose objects admit finite filtrations with subquotients among the @xmath11 . in other words , @xmath10 is the closure under extensions of the @xmath11 . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether @xmath10 is determined by the extension algebra @xmath12 together with its idempotents corresponding to the @xmath11 .",
    "again , the answer is no .",
    "this time , it is no even if we assume that @xmath8 is hereditary .",
    "again , we ask what additional structure on the extension algebra is needed to reconstruct the category of iterated extensions .",
    "the answer is that _ the extension algebra admits an @xmath0-structure which encodes the additional information needed for this task . _",
    "the aim of these lectures is to explain the answers to the two problems and to show how they fit into a general theory .      at the beginning of the sixties ,",
    "j.  stasheff invented @xmath0-spaces and @xmath0-algebras @xcite , @xcite as a tool in the study of ` group - like ' spaces .",
    "let us consider the basic example :    let @xmath13 be a topological space with a base point @xmath14 and let @xmath15 denote the space of based loops in @xmath16 : a point of @xmath15 is thus a continuous map @xmath17 taking the base point of the circle to the base point @xmath14 .",
    "we have the composition map @xmath18 sending a pair of loops @xmath19 to the loop @xmath20 obtained by running through @xmath21 on the first half of the circle and through @xmath22 on the second half @xmath23 this composition is non associative : for three loops @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , the composition @xmath25 runs through @xmath21 on the first _",
    "quarter _ of the circle whereas the composition @xmath26 runs through @xmath21 on the first _ half _ of the circle .",
    "we symbolize the two possibilities by the two binary trees with three leaves @xmath27 clearly , there is an homotopy @xmath28 \\times \\omega x \\times \\omega x { \\rightarrow}\\omega x.\\ ] ] joining the two possibilities of composing three loops .",
    "when we want to compose @xmath29 factors , there are @xmath30 possibilities corresponding to the @xmath30 binary trees with @xmath29 leaves . using @xmath31",
    ", we obtain two paths of homotopies joining the composition @xmath32 to the composition @xmath33 . @xmath34",
    "these two paths are clearly homotopic .",
    "let us denote an homotopy by @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the pentagon bounded by the two paths .",
    "when we want to compose @xmath30 factors , there are @xmath37 possibilities corresponding to the @xmath37 binary trees with @xmath30 leaves . using @xmath38 and @xmath31",
    ", we obtain paths linking the compositions and faces linking the paths .",
    "the resulting sphere is the boundary of the polytope @xmath39 depicted @xcite below .",
    "@xmath40 the pentagonal faces are copies of @xmath36 .    more generally , stasheff @xcite defined polytopes @xmath41 of dimension @xmath42 for all @xmath43 ( we have @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] ) and he defined an _",
    "@xmath0-space _ to be a topological space @xmath46 endowed with maps @xmath47 , @xmath43 , satisfying suitable compatibility conditions and admitting a ` strict unit ' .",
    "the loop space @xmath15 is the prime example of such a space @xmath46 .",
    "conversely @xcite , a topological space that admits the structure of an @xmath0-space and whose connected components form a group is homotopy equivalent to a loop space .",
    "if @xmath46 is an @xmath0-space , the singular chain complex of @xmath46 is the paradigmatic example of an @xmath0-algebra @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a field . an _",
    "@xmath0-algebra over @xmath1 _ ( also called a ` strongly homotopy associative algebra ' or an ` sha algebra ' ) is a @xmath48-graded vector space @xmath49 endowed with graded maps ( = homogeneous @xmath1-linear maps ) @xmath50 of degree @xmath51 satisfying the following relations    * we have @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 is a differential complex .",
    "* we have @xmath54 as maps @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes the identity map of the space @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath57 is a ( graded ) derivation with respect to the multiplication @xmath58 .",
    "* we have @xmath59 as maps @xmath60 .",
    "note that the left hand side is the associator for @xmath58 and that the right hand side may be viewed as the boundary of @xmath31 in the morphism complex @xmath61 ( the definition of the morphism complex is recalled below ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath58 is associative up to homotopy . * more generally , for @xmath62",
    ", we have @xmath63 where the sum runs over all decompositions @xmath64 and we put @xmath65 .",
    "we have adopted the sign conventions of getzler - jones @xcite .",
    "note that when these formulas are applied to elements , additional signs appear because of the koszul sign rule : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are graded maps , @xmath68,@xmath69 homogeneous elements and the vertical bars denote the degree .",
    "for example , we have @xmath70 so that @xmath71 is the usual differential on the tensor product .",
    "the defining identities are pictorially represented @xcite by @xmath72 we note three immediate consequences of the definition :    * in general , an @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 is not associative but its homology @xmath73 is an associative graded algebra for the multiplication induced by @xmath58 . *",
    "if @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , then @xmath76 is an ordinary associative algebra . indeed , since @xmath77 is of degree @xmath51 , all @xmath77 other than @xmath58 have to vanish .",
    "* if @xmath77 vanishes for all @xmath78 , then @xmath2 is an associative dg ( = differential @xmath48-graded ) algebra and conversely each dg algebra yields an @xmath0-algebra with @xmath79 for all @xmath78 .",
    "note that we have not defined unitality for @xmath0-algebras .",
    "however [ augmentedalgebras ] below .",
    "the following class of examples , due to penkava - schwarz @xcite , shows the close link between deformation theory and @xmath0-algebras ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) : let @xmath8 be an ordinary associative algebra , @xmath62 an integer and @xmath80 an indeterminate of degree @xmath51 and with @xmath81",
    ". an _ infinitesimal @xmath82-deformation of @xmath8 _ is a @xmath83$]-multilinear @xmath0-algebra structure on @xmath84 $ ] which lifts the multiplication of @xmath8 .",
    "thus an infinitesimal @xmath85-deformation is just an algebra deformation of @xmath8 .",
    "it is well - known and easy to check that infinitesimal @xmath85-deformations are in natural bijection with hochschild @xmath85-cocycles @xmath86 .",
    "analogously , infinitesimal @xmath82-deformations are in natural bijection with hochschild @xmath82-cocycles .",
    "thus , by working in the class of @xmath0-algebras , we may interpret hochschild cocycles of _ arbitrary degree _ @xmath87 as deformations .",
    "let us recall the dg algebra which is implicit in problem 2 : let @xmath8 be an ordinary associative @xmath1-algebra with @xmath3 and and @xmath6 a @xmath8-module .",
    "choose an injective resolution @xmath88 of @xmath6 and denote by @xmath89 the complex @xmath90 let @xmath91 be the morphism complex : recall that its @xmath82th component is the group of graded @xmath8-linear maps @xmath92 of degree @xmath82 ( no compatibility with @xmath93 ) and its differential is defined by @xmath94 .",
    "then @xmath95 endowed with its differential becomes a dg algebra for the natural composition of graded maps and its homology algebra is the extension algebra of @xmath6 : @xmath96 we claim that this has a canonical ( up to equivalence ) structure of @xmath0-algebra with @xmath97 and @xmath58 the usual multiplication . indeed ,",
    "more generally , we have the    [ minimality ] let @xmath2 be an @xmath0-algebra",
    ". then the homology @xmath98 has an @xmath0-algebra structure such that    * we have @xmath97 and @xmath58 is induced by @xmath99 and * there is a quasi - isomorphism of @xmath0-algebras @xmath100 lifting the identity of @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , this structure is unique up to ( non unique ) isomorphism of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the notion of morphism and quasi - isomorphism of @xmath0-algebras will be defined below ( [ morphisms ] ) .",
    "the most explicit construction of the @xmath0-structure on @xmath98 can be found in merkulov s @xcite . his construction is explained in terms of trees in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce some terminology : an @xmath0-algebra with vanishing @xmath57 is called _ minimal_. in the situation of the theorem , the @xmath0-algebra @xmath98 is called a _ minimal model _ for @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 is called _ formal _ if its minimal model can be chosen to be an ordinary associative graded algebra , i.e. such that @xmath79 for all @xmath78 .",
    "a graded algebra @xmath8 is _ intrinsically formal _ if each @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 whose homology is isomorphic to @xmath8 is formal .",
    "a sufficient condition for @xmath8 to be intrinsically formal in terms of its hochschild homology is given in @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the dg algebra of smooth real forms on a compact khler manifold is formal .",
    "in particular , this holds for smooth , complex projective manifolds .",
    "in contrast to the statement of the above theorem , one can also show that each @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 admits an ` anti - minimal ' model , i.e. there is a dg algebra @xmath101 and a quasi - isomorphism of @xmath0-algebras @xmath102 .",
    "thus , passing from dg algebras to @xmath0-algebras does not yield new quasi - isomorphism classes .",
    "what it does yield is a _ new description _ of these classes by minimal models .",
    "if , in the above example , we choose @xmath8 to be a finite - dimensional algebra and @xmath6 to be the sum of the simple @xmath8-modules , one can show that the dg algebra @xmath2 is formal iff @xmath8 is a koszul algebra .",
    "the smallest examples where @xmath2 is not formal is the algebra @xmath8 defined by the quiver with relations ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath103 here the extension algebra @xmath98 is given by the quiver with relations @xmath104 where the arrows @xmath105 are of degree @xmath3 and the arrow @xmath106 is of degree @xmath85 .",
    "we have @xmath79 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and all other products vanish ( the method for computing this is given at the end of section [ morphisms ] ) .",
    "this example illustrates the fact that the higher products of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath98 lift the massey products @xcite whenever these are defined .",
    "a _ morphism of @xmath0-algebras _",
    "@xmath109 is a family @xmath110 of graded maps of degree @xmath111 such that    * we have @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath21 is a morphism of complexes , * we have @xmath113 which means that @xmath21 commutes with the multiplication @xmath58 up to a homotopy given by @xmath22 , * more generally , for @xmath62 , we have @xmath114 where the first sum runs over all decompositions @xmath64 , we put @xmath65 , and the second sum runs over all @xmath115 and all decompositions @xmath116 ; the sign on the right hand side is given by @xmath117    the morphism @xmath118 is a _ quasi - isomorphism _ if @xmath21 is a quasi - isomorphism .",
    "it is _ strict _ if @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "the _ identity morphism _ is the strict morphism @xmath118 such that @xmath21 is the identity of @xmath2 .",
    "the _ composition _ of two morphisms @xmath121 and @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 where the sum and the sign are as in the defining identity .",
    "here is a ( slightly stylized ) pictorial representation of the defining identity for a morphism of @xmath0-algebras @xmath124 @xmath0-algebras may be viewed as algebras over an operad ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , only strict morphisms of @xmath0-algebras may then be viewed as morphisms of algebras .    as an illustration of the notion of morphism ,",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a dg algebra and let us construct the multiplication @xmath31 on @xmath98 and , at the same time , the first three terms of a quasi - isomorphism @xmath125 lifting the identity of @xmath98 .",
    "for this , we view @xmath98 as a complex with zero differential and we choose a morphism of complexes @xmath126 inducing the identity in homology .",
    "then @xmath21 commutes with the multiplication up to boundaries , i.e. there exists a graded map @xmath127 degree @xmath128 such that @xmath129 now we look for @xmath24 and @xmath31 such that @xmath130 in our situation , this simplifies into @xmath131 now it is easy to check that the map @xmath132 has its image in the cycles of @xmath2 .",
    "so there is indeed a map @xmath133 of degree @xmath134 and a map @xmath135 of degree @xmath128 such that the identity holds .",
    "if an @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 has a unital homology algebra @xmath136 , one can often simplify the computation of the minimal model for @xmath2 by passing to the category of augmented @xmath0-algebras . here",
    "are the relevant definitions :    a _ strictly unital @xmath0-algebra _ is an @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 endowed with an element @xmath137 of degree @xmath138 such that we have @xmath139 , @xmath140 for all @xmath141 and such that , for all @xmath142 , and all @xmath143 in @xmath2 , the product @xmath144 vanishes if one of the @xmath145 equals @xmath137 . if @xmath2 and @xmath8 are strictly unital @xmath0-algebras , a _ morphism _ of @xmath0-algebras @xmath146 is _ strictly unital _",
    "if we have @xmath147 and if for all @xmath148 and all @xmath143 , the element @xmath149 vanishes if one of the @xmath145 equals @xmath3 . each strictly unital @xmath0-algebra",
    "is canonically endowed with a strict ( hence strictly unital ) morphism @xmath150 mapping @xmath151 to @xmath137 .",
    "it is _ augmented _ if it is moreover endowed with a strictly unital morphism @xmath152 such that @xmath153 .",
    "a _ morphism of augmented @xmath0-algebras _ is a strictly unital morphism @xmath146 such that @xmath154 .",
    "it is then easy to check that the functor @xmath155 is an equivalence from the category of augmented @xmath0-algebras to the category of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the quasi - inverse functor sends an @xmath0-algebra @xmath8 to @xmath156 endowed with the unique strictly unital structure extending the structure of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an augmented @xmath0-algebra and let @xmath157 .",
    "clearly we obtain a minimal model for @xmath2 by taking @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a minimal model for @xmath160 in the category of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the computation of the minimal model for @xmath160 is simpler than that of @xmath2 , because we do not have to deal with the ` loop ' @xmath3 .",
    "the construction of minimal models and the above discussion extend to the case where the ground ring @xmath1 is no longer a field but a semi - simple ring @xmath161 , for example a product of fields .",
    "we then consider @xmath0-algebras in the monoidal category of @xmath161-@xmath161-bimodules .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath2 is an ordinary algebra augmented over a semi - simple ring @xmath161 , say @xmath162 .",
    "then the standard complex computing @xmath163 is of the form @xmath164 it has a canonical structure of dg algebra augmented over @xmath161 .",
    "thus the @xmath0-algebra @xmath163 may be chosen to be augmented over @xmath161 and , in particular , strictly unital .",
    "let us consider another example : suppose that @xmath1 is a field and that @xmath2 is a unital dg @xmath1-algebra endowed with a decomposition @xmath165 of @xmath137 into idempotents @xmath166 such that the complexes @xmath167 are acyclic for @xmath168 and that @xmath169 is quasi - isomorphic to @xmath170 .",
    "clearly @xmath2 is isomorphic to the matrix algebra @xmath171 and this algebra is quasi - isomorphic to its subalgebra of upper triangular matrices @xmath172 clearly @xmath8 is an augmented algebra over @xmath173 ( @xmath174 factors ) .",
    "so we obtain a minimal model for @xmath2 as the sum of @xmath161 with a minimal model for @xmath175 viewed as an @xmath0-algebra over @xmath161 .",
    "let @xmath176 be this minimal model .",
    "then we have a decomposition @xmath177 of @xmath161-@xmath161-bimodules and the tensor power @xmath178 is isomorphic to the sum of the @xmath179 taken over all sequences @xmath180 .",
    "these spaces vanish for @xmath181 so that in the minimal model we automatically have @xmath79 for @xmath181 .",
    "for example , if @xmath182 , i.e. if the unit of @xmath2 decomposes into @xmath183 , then @xmath176 is automatically formal .",
    "hence @xmath184 and @xmath2 are also formal in this case .",
    "the following lemma presents another case where the passage to the category of augmented @xmath0-algebras is easy .",
    "subalgebra _ of an @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 is a graded subspace @xmath8 such that @xmath185 maps @xmath186 to @xmath8 for all @xmath187 .",

    "we make @xmath194 into a graded coalgebra via the comultiplication @xmath195 defined by @xmath196 note that @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "it is then easy to see that each graded map @xmath199 of degree @xmath3 uniquely lifts to a graded coderivation @xmath200 of degree 1 , where _ coderivation _ means that we have @xmath201 to see that this is plausible , one should remember that algebra derivations @xmath202 are in bijection with maps @xmath203 .",
    "the component of @xmath204 that maps @xmath205 to @xmath206 is @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "thus we have a bijection between coderivations @xmath209 of degree @xmath3 and families of maps @xmath210 , @xmath62 , of degree @xmath3 .",
