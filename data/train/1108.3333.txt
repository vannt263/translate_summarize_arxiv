    "the advent of data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has already begun to provide a meaningful probe into a wide variety of long - standing scenarios for new physics . even with only @xmath1 of data",
    "currently under analysis , the atlas and cms experiments have been able to place stringent constraints on many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . at such integrated luminosities , the processes to which these experiments are sensitive are most notably those in which new particles are produced either via strong interactions , or else through an @xmath2-channel resonance . indeed , from limits on processes of this sort , lhc data have already placed stringent constraints on the parameter space of many of the most widely studied extensions of the sm , including many models involving weak - scale supersymmetry , extra dimensions , and additional exotic states such as @xmath3 gauge bosons .",
    "in addition to these popular scenarios , it is worthwhile to look for signals of less traditional extensions of the sm which , for one reason or another , could have been missed by the standard battery of new - physics searches at the lhc .",
    "for example , scenarios exist in which a strongly - interacting particle is produced copiously in hadron collisions , but decays in unexpected ways and is consequently overlooked .",
    "one example of such a particle is a light gluino in a supersymmetric theory with r - parity violation .",
    "such a particle has a relatively large pair - production cross - section at the lhc ; however , since each gluino so produced decays predominately to three jets , evidence for an r - parity - violating gluino would appear only in events with six or more jets in the final state .",
    "typical searches do not consider such high jet multiplicities , and based upon the results of those searches alone , it is almost inevitable that any particle with a decay pattern of this sort would be overlooked .",
    "however , searches for multi - jet resonances in high - jet - multiplicity events could potentially reveal evidence of such a particle .",
    "motivated by this consideration , the cms experiment recently performed a study of the three - jet invariant mass distribution in events with at least six jets  @xcite with @xmath4 of lhc data .",
    "the results of this study ( about which we will say more later ) now provide the leading constraints on the gluino mass in models with r - parity violation .",
    "a similar analysis was also recently performed by the cdf collaboration  @xcite with @xmath5 of tevatron data .",
    "information about supersymmetry is not the only aspect of physics beyond the standard model into which searches for resonances in multi - jet processes could provide an important window .",
    "for example , one of the most fundamental questions in particle physics is whether the sm gauge interactions unify at some high scale , and if so , precisely how this unification takes place and at what scale that might be .",
    "experimental signals which could provide information on unification are therefore immensely valuable from a theoretical perspective .",
    "an example of such a signal would be the discovery of an exotic matter field charged under the sm @xmath6 gauge group . indeed , a particle of this sort would significantly alter the renormalization - group running of the strong coupling coefficient @xmath7 , particularly if the @xmath6 representation under which those matter fields transformed was one of particularly large dimension .",
    "thus , the presence of such a field would compel a revision of our projection for the scale of grand unification  potentially dramatically , if the dimension of the representation in which the field or fields transformed were large enough to spoil the asymptotic freedom of @xmath6 . furthermore , as discussed above , strongly - interacting particles of this sort are precisely the sort of new physics to which lhc data will be sensitive during the first few @xmath8 of running .",
    "the prospects for observing exotic particles transforming in certain higher representations of @xmath6 at hadron colliders in final states comprising either four or six jets have been discussed in the literature before  @xcite . moreover , a number of searches for new strongly - interacting particles , including gluinos  @xcite , diquarks  @xcite , fourth - generation quarks  @xcite , and miscellaneous color - octet , sextet , and triplet fields  @xcite have been performed both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "to date , no compelling evidence of such particles has been found",
    ". however , such searches are generally only sensitive to the presence of particles which can decay either to a pair of strongly - interacting sm fields ( quarks or gluons ) , or else to a final state including some lighter neutral field which appears as missing energy .",
    "by contrast , a strongly - interacting particle which is forbidden by symmetry from coupling to any pair of sm fields in a theory in which no lighter , neutral field exists will be unconstrained by bounds from these typical searches .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the case for the r - parity - violating gluino scenario discussed above .",
    "however , a gluino of this sort is by no means the only example of a particle which might have been overlooked in traditional searches for new strongly - interacting fields .",
    "for example , as we shall demonstrate , there exist particular representations of @xmath6 for which an exotic field @xmath9 , if it transforms under one of these representations , is forbidden by gauge invariance from coupling to any pair of sm fields , but _ can _ couple to at least one combination of three sm quarks or gluons .",
    "the primary decay channel for such a field would likewise therefore be to three jets , while a two - jet final state would be forbidden .",
    "we have already mentioned some of the theoretical motivations for examining the detection prospects for fields which transform under higher representations of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , there is now also a motivation for such an analysis from lhc data . the aforementioned cms study  @xcite did observe an excess in the trijet - invariant - mass distribution at @xmath10  gev which differs from the sm prediction by more than @xmath11 ( though the significance is reduced to @xmath12 once the look - elsewhere effect is included ) .",
    "the authors compared this observed excess to that which would result from the r - parity - violating decays of a gluino with a mass @xmath13  gev , which turns out to be too small by a factor of roughly three .",
    "in other words , for some other field to provide a more compelling explanation of the observed excess , the product of pair - production cross - section for that field would need to be approximately thrice the @xmath14 expected for a gluino with @xmath13  gev , assuming the branching fraction for that field into three jets is roughly unity .",
    "indeed , as we shall demonstrate , a particle @xmath9 transforming in a higher representation of @xmath6 is capable of yielding an excess of the observed magnitude .",
    "we begin our analysis of the collider phenomenology of an exotic field transforming under a higher representation of @xmath6 in sect .",
    "[ sec : reptheory ] by examining the decay properties of such a field from a representation - theory perspective .",
    "in particular , we determine the representations for which the transformation properties of such a field under @xmath6 and spacetime symmetries alone forbid all direct decays to states involving only two sm quarks or gluons , but permit at least one decay channel involving three such particles . in sect .  [",
    "sec : pheno ] , we investigate the collider phenomenology of exotic fields in such representations , in which ( again , due to considerations related to representation theory ) pair production via strong interactions plays the dominant role . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cmscomparison ] , we discuss the implications of the recent cms multi - jet resonance search for fields in higher representations of @xmath6 and compare our results for the signals expected from such fields to the excess reported in ref .  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude .",
    "our primary aim in this paper is to examine the multi - jet phenomenology of an exotic field @xmath9 transforming under a higher representation of @xmath6 .",
    "however , in order to do this , we must first establish for which representations such a field is forbidden from coupling directly to any pair of sm particles by @xmath6 gauge invariance and lorentz invariance alone , but for which at least one gauge - invariant coupling to three strongly - interacting sm fields exists . in other words , we wish to enumerate the @xmath6 representations which permit at least one gauge - invariant operator @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an operator consisting of exactly three sm fields charged under @xmath6 ( , quarks , antiquarks , or gluons ) , @xmath18 is a dimensionless operator coefficient , @xmath19 is the suppression scale for the operator , and the value of the integer @xmath20 depends on the whether @xmath9 is a scalar or a fermion and on the particular collection of sm fields out of which @xmath21 is constructed . at the same time , we require that there not exist any gauge - invariant operator of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an operator consisting of exactly two sm fields charged under @xmath6 , and @xmath24 is , once again , a dimensionless coefficient .    in table",
    "[ tab : particledecomp ] , we list the @xmath6 representations which appear at least once in the decomposition of each possible direct product of two or three factors , assuming each factor is a @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 representation of @xmath6 . in addition",
    ", we display the lorentz representations which can be built from each of the corresponding three - particle states , up to spin 1 .",
    "we see from this table that a number of representations exist which do not appear in the decomposition of any two - particle state , but exist in the decomposition of at least one three - particle state .",
    "these include the complex representations @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( and their conjugate representations ) , as well as the real representation @xmath32 .",
    "exist , which we refer to here as @xmath33 and @xmath28 .",
    "the latter of these designates the completely symmetric combination of four @xmath25 representations .",
    "] moreover , we see that if @xmath9 transforms in the @xmath34 of @xmath6 , it can decay to two sm fields only if it is a boson .",
    "a fermionic @xmath34 must therefore decay to at least three strongly - interacting sm fields and , by similar reasoning , so must a bosonic @xmath33 .",
    ".a list of all representations contained in the decomposition of all combinations of two or three of the particles @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37",
    ". repeated occurrences of any single representation in the decomposition of each such product have been suppressed .",
    "[ tab : particledecomp ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one constraint on the presence of additional fields charged under @xmath6 comes from the requirement that @xmath38 must be well - behaved up to around the tev scale . in the presence of an exotic field @xmath9 charged under an arbitrary representation of @xmath6 , @xmath39",

    "the effect of including an additional field @xmath9 which transforms under each of the representations of @xmath6 listed in table  [ tab : repsandcasimirs ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphasplots ] .",
    "the curves shown in the left panel correspond to the cases in which @xmath9 is a scalar , while the curves in the right panel correspond to the cases in which @xmath9 is a dirac fermion . for each case , we have assumed that only a single additional generation of @xmath9 is present , and we have taken @xmath46  gev .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : alphasplots ] that the presence of even a single field @xmath9 transforming in many of the representations listed in table  [ tab : repsandcasimirs ] will result in @xmath39 developing a landau pole at a scale @xmath47 . imposing for theoretical consistency the requirement that such a divergence not appear at scales below @xmath48  tev",
    ", we find that both a fermionic @xmath29 and @xmath31 , as well as a scalar @xmath32 , are excluded .",
    "however , this constraint does not exclude a fermionic @xmath34 or @xmath28 , nor does it exclude a scalar @xmath33 , @xmath29 , or @xmath30 . for the rest of the paper we will therefore focus exclusively on these latter representations of low dimension .",
    "we note that for a single scalar @xmath33 , the theory remains asymptotically free , but for the other representations , a landau pole develops for @xmath39 at some scale @xmath49  tev ; we assume that a suitable short distance theory regulates this divergence .",
    "3.25 truein   3.25 truein    two additional comments are in order concerning the case in which @xmath9 is a fermion .",
    "first , the permissible @xmath6 representations for a fermionic @xmath9 , namely @xmath34 and @xmath28 , are both complex ; this implies that a fermion transforming in any of these representations must be a dirac rather than a majorana particle .",
    "second , whenever @xmath9 has chiral charges , anomaly - cancellation requirements place additional constraints on the theory . given the unorthodox representation of @xmath6 in which @xmath9 is assumed to transform , these constraints are generally quite difficult to satisfy simultaneously in any phenomenologically reasonable model .",
    "we will henceforth assume that @xmath9 is vector - like and thus does not contribute to gauge anomalies .",
    "having now established the representations of @xmath6 for which an exotic field can decay to no fewer than three jets , we proceed to investigate the collider phenomenology of a field @xmath9 transforming in one of these representations .",
    "we focus here on the case in which @xmath9 is either a scalar or a dirac fermion . since , by construction , no gauge - invariant operators of the form specified in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ops2body ] ) exist for @xmath9 , no couplings of the form @xmath50 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 exist either .",
    "it therefore follows that @xmath9 can not be produced singly as an @xmath2-channel resonance .",
    "it may be produced in association with some other sm particle or particles through an operator of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ops3body ] ) , but the corresponding amplitude would be suppressed by powers of @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "the pair production of @xmath9 and @xmath53 ( via the coupling @xmath54 to the gluon field required by gauge invariance ) is the dominant production channel at hadron colliders .",
    "once produced , we assume that @xmath9 decays exclusively via operators of the form @xmath15 to a trijet final state , with @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , by construction , all two - body decay channels for @xmath9 are forbidden .",
    "moreover , restrictions on the permissible @xmath56 assignments for @xmath9 detailed in table  [ tab : repsandcasimirs ] imply that all additional three - body decays involving charged leptons are forbidden by charge conservation for all viable @xmath6 and lorentz representations of @xmath9 , save for potentially the fermionic @xmath34 .",
    "even for this representation , such decays may be forbidden either by choosing @xmath57 or by requiring lepton - number conservation and assigning @xmath9 a lepton number @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , we expect the primary collider signature of @xmath9 to be analogous to that of an r - parity - violating gluino : a final state consisting of at least six high-@xmath59 jets , from which two combinations of three jets reconstruct to an invariant mass peak at @xmath60 . moreover , since we are assuming that @xmath55 , the collider phenomenology of @xmath9 will be essentially independent of the operator coefficients @xmath18 and the suppression scale @xmath19 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ops3body ] ) , as long as these quantities are such that @xmath9 decays promptly .      3.25 truein    in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhvsgluinoplot ] , we plot the ratio of @xmath80 to the total production cross - section for a gluino of the same mass at leading - order ( in the limit in which all squark masses are taken to be infinitely heavy ) as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "the curves shown correspond to all otherwise phenomenologically consistent combinations of @xmath6 and lorentz representations for @xmath9 for which all @xmath81 are forbidden , but for which at least one @xmath15 is allowed . for the parton - distribution functions",
    ", we have used the cteq6l1  @xcite pdf set , and we have taken @xmath82  tev .",
    "the cross - section enhancement factors are much larger for fermions than for scalars , as one would expect , and each decreases slowly with increasing @xmath69 . for @xmath83  gev , which corresponds to the value of @xmath84 for which the greatest excess was observed by the cms collaboration ,",
    "the cross - section for the pair production of a scalar @xmath33 is roughly twice that for a gluino . for the fermionic @xmath34 and scalar @xmath29 ,",
    "the corresponding enhancement factor is roughly ten , and for the fermionic @xmath28 and scalar @xmath30 , it is far larger .",
    "having derived results for the pair - production cross - sections for an exotic field @xmath9 in a higher representation of @xmath6 , we now assess the implications of the recent cms trijet resonance search  @xcite for such a particle . in this search ,",
    "events with at least six jets were considered , and invariant masses @xmath84 were reconstructed for all twenty possible combinations of three jets from among the six highest-@xmath59 jets in each such event .",
    "a series of event - selection criteria were then imposed , including a cut on @xmath84 designed to reduce the combinatoric background .",
    "the prediction for the sm background , to which the qcd background provides the dominant contribution , was obtained by fitting an exponential function of the form @xmath85 to the @xmath84 distribution obtained for @xmath86 events in experimental data ( where @xmath87 denotes the number of jets in the event ) , and then subsequently rescaling the normalization coefficient @xmath88 on the basis of the average scalar @xmath59 of the triplets observed in the @xmath62 data . the prediction for the signal , which was assumed to be from a decaying gluino of mass @xmath89 in a supersymmetric model with r - parity violation ,",
    "was obtained by simulating event samples for a broad range of @xmath89 . for each value of @xmath89 , an acceptance @xmath90 , representing the effect of the event - selection criteria on the signal sample , was obtained . from the form of the acceptance function @xmath90 , which was found to be approximately quadratic in @xmath89 ,",
    "limits on the gluino production cross - section in such theories  and therefore a limit on @xmath89  was derived .    in order to estimate the corresponding exclusion limits on the mass of a particle @xmath9 in a given representation of @xmath6",
    ", we make the assumption that the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) k - factor for @xmath9 pair production at the @xmath82  tev lhc is essentially the same as the k - factor for gluino pair production for any given value of @xmath69 within the range of interest . under this assumption , we may obtain the nlo cross - section for the pair production of @xmath9 by scaling the nlo cross - section for gluino production by the enhancement factor displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhvsgluinoplot ] . by comparing these results to the observed 95% cl limits on the production cross - section for a heavy particle which decays primarily into three jets",
    ", we obtain our exclusion limits on @xmath69 for each of the otherwise phenomenologically viable @xmath6 representations for @xmath9 enumerated in sect .",
    "[ sec : reptheory ] . note that we are also assuming that the cut acceptance is independent of the lorentz and @xmath6 representation .    3.25 truein    in fig .",
    "[ fig : greenyellowplot ] , we display the nlo production cross - sections for the production of a fermionic @xmath34 , a scalar @xmath33 , a fermionic @xmath28 , a scalar @xmath29 , and a scalar @xmath30 over the range of @xmath69 pertinent to the cms trijet analysis .",
    "also shown are the expected and observed 95% confidence - level ( cl ) exclusion limits on the pair - production cross - section for a particle decaying essentially exclusively to three jets obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the @xmath91 and @xmath92 bands on the expected limit .",
    "any value of @xmath69 for which the nlo cross - section exceeds the observed limit can be considered to be excluded at 95%  cl . from this figure , it is apparent that a scalar @xmath33 is clearly excluded for @xmath93  gev . for the case in which @xmath9 is a fermionic @xmath28 or a scalar @xmath30 , the exclusion limit on @xmath69 from cms data extends slightly beyond the mass range for which the exclusion contour is displayed in ref .",
    "one can estimate the exclusion limit on a fermionic @xmath28 or scalar @xmath30 by examining where the extrapolated curve corresponding to the _ expected _",
    "95%  cl limit and the nlo pair - production cross - section intersect . based on this prescription , we find that the cms data exclude a fermionic @xmath28 with a mass @xmath94  gev and a scalar @xmath30 with a mass @xmath95  gev .",
    "similarly , the data can be interpreted as excluding a fermionic @xmath34 and scalar @xmath29 with @xmath96  gev and @xmath97  gev , respectively .",
    "however , it is important to note that for @xmath98  gev , which corresponds to the range of @xmath84 for which the cms collaboration reported its greatest excess , the estimated production cross - section for a fermionic @xmath34 or scalar @xmath29 only marginally exceeds the observed @xmath99  cl limit . given the uncertainties in the nlo estimate for @xmath9 production , , a fermionic @xmath34 or scalar @xmath29 with a mass @xmath98  gev can therefore also be interpreted as being consistent with the data .",
    "even more intriguing , however , is the fact that the cms collaboration _ did _ report a @xmath12 excess in the number of observed jet triplets in the invariant - mass range @xmath100 .",
    "specifically , an excess of approximately 30 total jet triplets over an expected sm background of approximately 120 jet triplets was observed in this range .",
    "we find that the distribution of these excess events as a function of @xmath84 can be reasonably well modeled by a gaussian centered around @xmath101  gev , with a width of approximately 15  gev .",
    "given the results for the acceptance function @xmath90 obtained by the cms collaboration , we find that this excess is roughly @xmath102 times larger than that which would be expected for a gluino with @xmath103  gev . in other words ,",
    "the observed excess could be accounted for by a particle with similar production and decay phenomenology to that of a gluino in an r - parity - violating supersymmetry scenario , but with a production cross - section approximately @xmath104 times larger than that for such a particle .",
    "we observe that while it is therefore improbable ( though perhaps still possible ) that a gluino could account for the observed excess reported by cms , an additional field @xmath9 transforming in a higher representation of @xmath6 provides a more reasonable fit to the data .",
    "indeed , it is apparent from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhvsgluinoplot ] that a new scalar field @xmath9 with a mass @xmath105  gev which transforms in the @xmath33 representation of @xmath106 would have just the right cross - section to account for the observed excess .",
    "however , we reiterate that due to the uncertainties in the nlo k - factors , , a dirac fermion of comparable mass transforming in the @xmath34 representation or a scalar transforming in the @xmath29 representation could potentially also explain the observed excess .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the multi - jet - resonance study performed by the cms collaboration , which was motivated primarily as a search for a light gluino in r - parity - violating supersymmetric models , can also be used to probe a variety of other scenarios for new physics .",
    "in particular , we have shown that there exist several representations of @xmath6 for which a heavy exotic field @xmath9 transforming under one of these representations is likewise forced by gauge and lorentz invariance alone to decay essentially exclusively to a trijet final state .",
    "we have examined the detection prospects for such a particle , and have used the results of the cms study to derive exclusion limits on the representations of @xmath6 under which @xmath9 could feasibly transform , given additional constraints from renormalization - group running ,     furthermore , we have shown that the @xmath107 excess at a trijet invariant mass of @xmath108  gev reported in that study can be explained by the presence of an scalar transforming as a @xmath33 or @xmath29 of @xmath6 , or by a dirac fermion transforming as a @xmath34 .",
    "( the scalar @xmath33 provides the best fit to the data . ) by contrast , the production cross - section for an r - parity - violating gluino is substantially smaller , and such a particle therefore offers a less compelling explanation for the observed excess . as further data is accumulated by the atlas and cms experiments , it will be interesting to see whether that data corroborate this potential signal of new physics , and if so , whether they remain consistent with the interpretation we have suggested here .",
    "more generally , any future excess or peak observed in a multi - jet invariant - mass distribution ( in events with or without the presence of substantial missing energy ) is amenable to an analysis of the sort .",
    "it should be noted that the assumptions we have made in sect .",
    "[ sec : cmscomparison ] concerning the k - factors for the production cross - sections for fields in higher representations of @xmath0 are certainly reasonable in the absence of explicit nlo calculations , and to date , such calculations have yet to be performed .",
    "we note , however , that the true nlo k - factors for these cross - sections may differ  perhaps significantly  from those adopted in this study .",
    "indeed , examples of situations in which the result of a full nlo calculation turned out to differ significantly from the projected result adopted for the purpose of preliminary analysis do exist in the literature  @xcite . given this , the results displayed in this study can be taken as sufficient motivation for detailed nlo analyses of the pair - production cross - sections for fields in higher representations of su(3 ) .",
    "indeed , the results of such analyses may prove crucial for distinguishing between new - physics explanations for a given signal or data anomaly observed at the lhc .",
    "if any multi - jet resonance is indeed confirmed at the lhc , the next step would be to identify complementary channels in which one could obtain evidence that such a resonance is indeed due to a particle transforming under one of the representations of @xmath6 which intrinsically forbid all decays to anything other than a trijet final state .",
    "fortunately , in any grand unified ( or even partially unified ) theory , any field transforming under a higher representation of @xmath6 would necessarily have to be incorporated into some representation of the unified group .",
    "therefore , if some such field is truly responsible for a given multi - jet resonance , each different unification scenario which could accommodate that field would generically provide a prediction for other new particles which could also potentially be discovered at the lhc .",
    "these predictions become particularly explicit for fields in representations which would dramatically alter the running of @xmath7 to the extent that new physics would be required only slightly above the tev scale to regulate divergences in the theory . even in less extreme situations ,",
    "however , any effect on the running of @xmath7 could potentially alter the unification scale , and signals of particles transforming in higher representations of @xmath6 could thus provide valuable insight into the nature of our universe at high scales .",
