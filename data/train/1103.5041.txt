    "the dynamo phenomena , where magnetic fields are self - generated by a moving and electrically conducting fluid , is one of the most intriguing subjects of modern magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "dynamos have particularly important applications in astrophysics . today",
    "it is widely believed that the magnetic fields of planets and stars originate from dynamo action in their interiors @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , all astrophysical dynamos are turbulent with extremely high fluid reynolds numbers @xmath1 , which makes theoretical treatments very involved and realistic simulations are currently impossible . at the same time , some key physical processes likely at work in astrophysical dynamos can be revealed by considering idealized laminar dynamos related to spatially smooth stationary velocity fields at comparatively low @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", the theoretical study of laminar dynamos allows one to determine the critical magnetic reynolds number , above which dynamo excitation takes place , to find the structure and magnitude of saturated dynamo field , and to understand the influence on the dynamo of different plasma effects , such as compressibility , two - fluid effects , and anisotropic transport .",
    "a number of laminar mhd flows appropriate for dynamo generation have been analyzed in the literature @xcite . in most of these studies only the kinematic dynamo problem has been considered , in which the magnetic induction equation is solved as an eigenvalue problem for a given velocity field ( not necessarily satisfying the navier - stokes equation ) to find the growth rate of the magnetic field .",
    "the non - linear feedback of the fields on the flows is ignored in the kinematic treatment . among the laminar flows that lead to kinematic dynamos at sufficiently high magnetic reynolds numbers are cylindrical helical jets ( ponomarenko dynamo @xcite ) , two - dimensional spatially periodic arrays of helical jets ( roberts scheme @xcite ) , cylindrical von krmn @xcite and taylor - couette flows @xcite , and spherical dudley - james flows @xcite .",
    "the first three of these flows have been tested recently in experiments with liquid sodium , and successful observations of dynamo action have been reported in refs .",
    "the flows in these experiments were turbulent , thus making it difficult to compare experimental data with predictions of laminar dynamo theory , although in the first two , the role of turbulence was small as the flows were strongly constrained .",
    "this is a common disadvantage of all liquid metal dynamo experiments : the extremely low magnetic prandtl numbers ( the ratio of kinetic viscosity @xmath4 to resistivity @xmath5 or , equivalently , the ratio of magnetic reynolds to fluid reynolds @xmath6 for liquid sodium ) requires very high fluid reynolds numbers ( @xmath7 ) in order to achieve the magnetic reynolds number sufficient for dynamo action ( @xmath8 ) in liquid metals . as a result",
    "the relevant flow is always turbulent .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the madison plasma couette experiment ( mpcx ) @xcite , which is designed to study mhd phenomena driven by plasma flows .",
    "one of the novelties of this experiment is the ability to change the magnetic prandtl number of the plasma by several orders of magnitude from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "this flexibility makes it possible to investigate laminar dynamos by choosing a regime with @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as a result",
    "the direct comparison of experimental data with numerical simulations of laminar dynamo can be performed .",
    "such a comparison can also be used for the first time to test different mhd models as well as the numerical codes which simulate them .",
    "the goal of this study is to investigate possible dynamo action in the mpcx using the extended mhd code nimrod @xcite , which can accurately model plasma dynamics in the specific geometry for realistic experimental conditions . among the features of nimrod",
    "is the possibility to study effects beyond standard mhd , including the addition of the hall term in ohm s law .",
    "the effect of the hall term on dynamo action has recently been studied in periodic box simulations @xcite , and the hall term will almost certainly play an important role in mpcx .",
    "the results of our simulations can also be used for the optimization of plasma parameters and as a guidance for the experimental operation .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of nimrod simulations of laminar magnetic dynamo in the cylindrical von krmn flow under conditions relevant to mpcx .",

    "vi we conclude with a discussion of the effects that can influence the magnetic dynamo in such plasma flows .",
    "mpcx is closely related to the spherical plasma experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , though here the geometry is cylindrical and the apparatus is somewhat smaller in size ( 1 m in diameter ) . in mpcx",
    "the plasma is confined by a multi - cusp magnetic field created by axisymmetric rings of permanent magnets of alternating polarity and localized at the boundary of the cylindrical chamber ( fig .",
    "there are 10 magnetic rings at the cylindrical wall and 8 at both the top and bottom end - caps .",
    "ring anodes and cathodes positioned between the magnet rings can be biased with arbitrary potentials .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 drift of plasma is in the azimuthal direction and can be an arbitrary axisymmetric function at the boundary of the vessel .",
    "this arrangement allows arbitrary shear flows to be imposed in the mpcx experiment .",
    "drift is in the azimuthal direction . by varying the potential between the anodes and cathodes the velocity forcing at the outer boundary",

    "the boundary conditions for the full electric and magnetic fields are : @xmath58 ( perfectly conducting walls ) , and the velocity conditions are : @xmath59 ( no - slip differentially rotating rigid walls ) .",
    "these velocity boundary conditions correspond approximately to von krmn flow : the top and bottom end - caps are counter - rotating with the same angular velocity , and the side wall has a linear dependence of angular velocity on @xmath56 to match the rotation of top and bottom end - caps .",
    "this flow is the primary object of our dynamo study .",
    "we briefly remark on the spatial and temporal resolution used in these simulations . for spatial discretization nimrod",

    "we have used a uniform meshing of the @xmath54 plane with @xmath63 finite elements each of polynomial degree 3 , and 11 fourier harmonics in the azimuthal @xmath60-direction .",
    "this spatial resolution appears to be sufficient for the laminar flows under consideration . to verify the simulation results obtained at this resolution , we have repeated a nonlinear mhd run introduced in section v using mesh with @xmath64 finite elements in @xmath54 plane and 11 azimuthal modes .",

    "the solutions are time - evolved using a semi - implicit staggered leap - frogging algorithm , which is fully detailed in refs .",
    "we should emphasize here that the algorithm employed in nimrod can be made numerically stable for arbitrarily large time - steps in both single - fluid and hall mhd by choosing the appropriate coefficients of the semi - implicit operators @xcite .",
    "however , in order to accurately model the temporal behavior of the system with significant flows , in the present simulations we have used an adaptive time - step based on the explicit courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition for advection . even in the dynamo simulations , we find that advection by the axisymmetric velocity field dominates the cfl criteria , rather than either the alfvn or whistler waves associated with the relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "in this section we consider the basic hydrodynamical ( no magnetic field , @xmath65 ) properties of von krmn flow in cylinder , in which the plasma is stirred at the edge via the boundary conditions of set ii ( [ bcv2 ] ) . we start with axisymmetric case , assuming that physical quantities do not depend on @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "axisymmetric equilibrium flow structure for fluid reynolds number @xmath52 and mach number @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "the velocity components are either symmetric ( radial @xmath68 ) or antisymmetric ( azimuthal @xmath69 and axial @xmath70 ) with respect to equatorial plane @xmath71 , and the azimuthal velocity has maxima at the corners of the cylinder .",

    "@xmath87 is about 0.3@xmath88 of the total energy of the flow @xmath89 . due to the lack of an axisymmetric magnetic field ( @xmath90 ) and the small amplitude of the non - axisymmetric fields ,",

    "the energy of the saturated dynamo field scales as @xmath96 ( @xmath97 for the field amplitude ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the magnetic induction equation ( [ model3 ] ) , which in a saturated state ( @xmath75 ) now reads : @xmath98 indeed , if the magnetic reynolds number @xmath2 and functions @xmath34 and @xmath33 are independent of @xmath41 , then the solution for the magnetic field @xmath35 can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a vector - function independent of @xmath41 satisfying equation @xmath101 and boundary conditions ( [ bcb2 ] ) . in the case under consideration",

    "we have performed numerical simulations of a plasma dynamo for cylindrical von krmn flow using the extended mhd code nimrod .",
    "these nimrod simulations provide numerical support for the madison plasma couette experiment ( mpcx ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that sustained dynamo action and self - generation of magnetic field can be attained for parameters that are achievable in the experiment .",
    "our results show that the critical magnetic reynolds number required for dynamo excitation strongly depends on the plasma compressibility : the more compressible the fluid , the higher the critical @xmath2 ( fig .  [ f6 ] ) .",

    "such distortions with even azimuthal mode numbers ( @xmath73 ) appear in the flow only for modest values of fluid reynolds number @xmath79 when the axisymmetric shear flow becomes hydrodynamically unstable .",
    "therefore , in order to observe the dynamo effect in the mpcx , the plasma has to be driven above a critical hydrodynamical threshold . for a helium plasma with number density @xmath105 m@xmath27 , electron temperature @xmath106 ev and ion temperature @xmath107 ev , the peak driving velocity should be @xmath108 km / s .",
    "another issue is related to the detection of the laminar dynamo field in the experiment .",

    "such a small field is still detectable even on the background of the much stronger multi - cusp field from the rings of magnets ( about @xmath110 gauss near the walls ) due to the different azimuthal symmetries of these two fields .",
