    "as @xmath17 becomes larger than @xmath319 , the strong - coupling theory yields a double - peak structure in @xmath320 .",
    "when we increase the lattice size and reduce  @xmath233 , this feature also appears in our ddmrg data for @xmath321 .",
    "therefore , this feature is not an artifact of the strong - coupling approach even though the strong - coupling expansion overestimates the double - peak structure for @xmath310 .",
    "the strong - coupling expansion solves an effective single - particle problem in a ( finite - range , attractive ) potential .",
    "such a potential gives rise to a non - trivial spectrum ( resonances and possibly bound states ) .",

    "please note the different scales of the ordinates.[sqwmi ] ]    _ superfluid phase .",
    "[ skwsf ] and  [ sqwsft0.40qpi ] present the corresponding results for the dynamical structure factor in the sf phase . at small momenta",
    ", bogoliubov theory gives the correct slope of the dispersion which we derive from the maximum of the ddmrg data for @xmath201 .",
    "note that the dispersion @xmath324 in  ( [ be ] ) is identical to the predictions from field theory  @xcite .",
    "bogoliubov s dispersion overestimates the ddmrg maxima for larger momenta and higher energies , as observed experimentally for a 3d setup  @xcite .",
    "as compared to the mi phase , the density - density response has higher intensity in the sf state .",

    "this high - energy double peak in the sf phase resembles the structure seen in the mi phase . in our opinion , this rules out an interpretation of the second peak as signature of a massive higgs mode  @xcite .     in the superfluid phase of the bose  hubbard model with @xmath29 .",

    "the aim of this paper was twofold : ( i )  to provide extensive numerical ( d)dmrg data for static and dynamical quantities of the one - dimensional bose  hubbard model at integer filling , mostly for @xmath326 ; ( ii ) to compare the ( d)dmrg results with the analytical strong coupling perturbation theory and the numerically inexpensive vca and thereby explore their merits and limitations in the most demanding case of one dimension .",
    "the ground - state energy from dmrg compares favorably with results from vca and from perturbation theory . for static correlation functions such as the single - particle density matrix and the momentum distribution",
    ", the comparison between dmrg data and strong - coupling perturbation theory ( vca ) shows that the latter are reliable for @xmath327 ( @xmath328 ) , for doable implementations .",
    "we calculated dynamical quantities such as the single - particle spectral function and the dynamical structure factor . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the response at low energies is dominated by the quasi - condensate , in agreement with predictions from field theory and bogoliubov theory .",
    "the latter provides the correct result for the phonon mode despite the fact that it is based on the incorrect assumption of a true condensate . for finite interactions and at higher energies , the dynamical structure factor is broad and reflects the physics of the mott insulator .",
    "the overall character of the single - particle spectrum and the sound velocity of the phonon modes are reproduced by vca for larger values of @xmath17 .",
    "the strong - coupling results for the dynamical structure factor helped us to interpret our numerical ddmrg data because the latter are spectrally broadened for finite system sizes .",
    "the two - particle correlation function in the mott phase reflects the ( scattering ) states of a doubly occupied site and a hole with a hard - core repulsion and a ( weak ) longer - ranged attraction giving rise to a double - peak structure in the dynamical structure factor near the boundary of the brillouin zone .    our numerical work can be compared with experiments only after the parabolic confinement potentials will have been taken into account .",
    "important as it is to confine the atoms to the optical lattice , the confinement potential often is so strong that the density profile contains several mott regions with different integer fillings and transition regions between them . in this case , the structure factor at low energies describes the dynamical response of the ` wedding - cake ' density profile  @xcite .",
    "there are two other directions to extend our work .",
    "the mott gap in the bose ",
    "hubbard model resembles a band gap .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see how bound states ( ` excitons ' ) form in this gap in the presence of a nearest - neighbor attraction .",
    "a second route to extend our work is the inclusion of a disorder potential  @xcite so that the smearing and closing of the mott gap as a function of the disorder can be studied .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
