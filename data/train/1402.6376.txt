    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are suitable sites to study the evolution of dust grains since their progenitors , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , are among the most efficient sources of circumstellar dust in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these stars lose large amounts of material and create circumstellar envelopes with both low temperatures ( below 1500 k in the regions of dust formation ) and high densities ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ) , where dust grains are efficiently formed .    in @xcite , we studied iron depletions into dust grains in a sample of 33 galactic disk pne .",
    "iron is an important contributor to the mass of dust grains @xcite , and its gaseous abundance can be used as a proxy for the amount of depletion of other elements .",
    "we found low iron gaseous abundances in all the objects , suggesting that more than 90% of their iron atoms are located in grains .",
    "we also found that the range of iron depletions covers about two orders of magnitude , which may be a consequence of differences in the formation and evolution of the grains in the different nebulae .",
    "we did not find any obvious correlation between iron abundances and parameters related to the nebular age ( such as the nebular radius or the surface brightness ) or to the dominant chemistry in the nebulae ( c - rich or o - rich ) that could provide clues on the reasons behind the different depletions .",
    "however , the information available for the studied sample was scarce .",
    "on the other hand , the dust features that appear in the infrared spectra of pne provide information on the composition of their dust grains . in our galaxy ,",
    "pne with crystalline silicates , many of them also with pahs , are the most numerous @xcite .",
    "besides , a general correlation has been found between infrared features and c / o abundance ratios : magellanic clouds pne with silicates have c / o  @xmath0 , and those with carbonaceous dust have c / o  @xmath6 , although for galactic pne the situation is less clear @xcite .",
    "the relative abundances of carbon and oxygen in the envelope of an agb star depends on the nucleosynthesis processes occurring in the inner regions , which in turn depends on the mass of the progenitor star and on its initial metallicity . in our galaxy ,",
    "we expect stars to be born with an almost solar c / o ratio ( c / o  @xmath7 , @xcite ) , that may change during the evolution of the star depending on its initial mass .",
    "theoretical models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that the less massive progenitors ( m@xmath8  @xmath92 m@xmath10 ) will remain o - rich during their whole evolution .",
    "stars with masses in the range @xmath3 24 m@xmath10 may evolve from o - rich to c - rich due to the third dredge - up process that enriches the surface of the agb star with carbon . in the most massive progenitors ( m@xmath8 @xmath11 45 m@xmath10 ) , the hot bottom burning process occurs efficiently and , since it converts carbon into nitrogen via the cn cycle , it can prevent the formation of a c - rich star .",
    "the value of c / o in a dust - forming stellar envelope defines whether the dust particles will be c - rich or o - rich .",
    "if carbon is more abundant than oxygen , all the oxygen atoms will be trapped in co molecules and carbon atoms will be available to form c - rich compounds , such as graphite , amorphous carbon , or silicon carbide ( sic ) .",
    "if oxygen is more abundant than carbon , all the carbon atoms will be trapped by co and the remaining oxygen atoms will form o - rich grains like silicates and oxides .",
    "oxygen rich nebulae could have iron deposited in metallic iron grains , silicates and oxides , whereas c - rich nebulae are expected to have their iron atoms in the form of metallic grains , fe@xmath12c , fesi , fes , and fes@xmath13 @xcite . therefore , iron depletion factors could be different in c - rich and o - rich pne .",
    "the c - rich or o - rich chemistry may be studied from the c / o abundance ratios or from the infrared dust features , and we expect both to be related . in principle , c - rich features such as sic are expected in pne with c / o  @xmath6 ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas o - rich features like silicates are expected in pne with c / o  @xmath0 .",
    "_ iso _ and _ spitzer _ telescopes allow us to detect and identify several dust species in the spectra of pne and therefore , to classify pne as c - rich or o - rich according to the observed features .    here",
    ", we extend the work performed in @xcite by studying a sample of galactic pne that nearly doubles the previous one and also by analyzing possible correlations between their iron depletions , c / o abundance ratios , and infrared dust features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our sample of galactic pne , whereas in section 3 we present the calculation of electron temperatures and densities for all the objects .",
    "section 4 contains an extensive discussion of the iron abundance and depletion factor calculations .",
    "section 5 details the calculation of c / o abundance ratios from collisionally excited lines ( cels ) and recombination lines ( rls ) , and the comparison between these two estimates .",
    "the compilation of infrared dust features observed in the sample is presented in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we discuss our results and study the correlation between iron abundances , c / o values , and dust features in our sample of pne .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "our sample consists of 56 galactic pne with published spectra of relatively high spectral resolution and deep enough to detect the lines we need to calculate physical conditions and iron abundances .",
    "the sample includes 28 galactic pne studied in @xcite , but we exclude nebulae with electron densities above 25000 @xmath14  since it is difficult to derive reliable physical conditions and chemical abundances in these objects @xcite . besides , we set an upper limit on the @xmath15 intensity ratio of 0.6 , in order to avoid high excitation pne for which the iron correction scheme adopted here may not apply @xcite . the final sample of 56 pne is presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "the new values derived for the physical conditions imply oxygen abundances that are within @xmath1850.15 dex of the old values .",

    "these differences can be related to the pne ages or grain compositions , maybe reflecting different efficiencies of the grain formation and destruction processes , an issue that we will explore further in the following sections .",
    "as we mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , one can expect a correlation between the c / o abundance ratios and the type of dust grains present in pne .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining accurate values of c / o for pne is not easy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ionic abundances of carbon and oxygen can be derived from collisionally excited lines ( cels ) or from recombination lines ( rls ) , and the abundances obtained with rls are systematically higher than the ones derived from cels , by factors that are around two for many pne but can reach @xmath370 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is still a matter of debate and we do not know which lines lead to more representative abundances in pne .",
    "the abundances derived from cels are highly dependent on the electron temperature , but these lines are brighter than rls and thus , more easily measured .",
    "on the other hand , rls are weakly dependent on physical conditions , but they are faint and may suffer from other problems ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    one important source of uncertainties in the c / o values derived from cels is the normalization between ultraviolet and optical fluxes since carbon lines are found in the ultraviolet range whereas oxygen lines are better measured in the optical range .",
    "this correction introduces uncertainties in the values of c / o , which are more severe for extended objects , where ultraviolet and optical observations may cover different regions of the nebula .",
    "one advantage of using rls is that this issue does not arise , since they are observed in the optical range .",
    "a further complication is introduced by the icfs needed to account for unobserved ions and estimate the total abundances . for oxygen",
    "we have used here the equation proposed by @xcite to correct for the contribution of o@xmath436 to the total abundance . in the case of oxygen abundances based on rls , only the o@xmath179 abundances can be easily calculated , and we assume that the distribution of all ionization states is equal to the one inferred from cels . as for carbon , one can apply the widely used correction scheme of @xcite , consisting of several icfs which are employed depending on the degree of ionization of the object and the detected ionization stages ( up to four different ions can be observed in pne : c@xmath186 , c@xmath179 , c@xmath436 , and c@xmath604 ) , although certain cases are not covered by this scheme .",
    "therefore , the correction scheme of @xcite produces an inhomogeneous determination of carbon abundance when applied to different objects .",
    "the other method that is frequently adopted to calculate c / o is @xmath648 .",
    "however , this icf generally overestimates the value of c / o , especially in low ionization pne @xcite . here",
    "we calculate c / o in a homogeneous way using the icf derived in @xcite : @xmath649 where @xmath650 .",
    "this icf is valid in the range @xmath651 . in this range , the icf",
    "is expected to reproduce the values of c / o to within @xmath652 dex",
    ". however , the c / o values derived for ngc  40 ( with @xmath653 ) , and for ic  3568 , ic  5217 , ngc  3242 , ngc  5882 , m3 - 32 , ngc  7662 ( all of them with @xmath654 ) are more uncertain . for ngc  40 ,",
    "we estimate a confidence interval of @xmath655 dex ; for the objects with the highest values of @xmath656 , we estimate confidence intervals of @xmath657 dex .",
    "these uncertainties will be taken into account in the forthcoming analysis .",
    "the value of the icf in equation  ( 5 ) is close to 1 for most of our objects , where @xmath658 , changing the c@xmath179/o@xmath179 ratio by less than 0.05 dex .",
    "however , in the low ionization pne ic  418 and ngc  40 , the differences between both estimates reach 0.9 dex .",
    "we compared the values of c / o implied by the three different methods described above ( @xmath648 , the set of icfs from @xcite , and the icf from @xcite ) and by the two types of lines we use ( cels or rls ) .",
    "we find that the differences seem to be more related to whether we use cels or rls than to the correction scheme we apply .",
    "hence we will restrict the forthcoming discussion to the values of c / o calculated with equation  ( 5 ) , derived either from rls or from cels .",
    "the c@xmath179 abundances were calculated from the fluxes of the ] @xmath659 doublet ( provided in the same papers we use for the optical fluxes , see table  [ tab:1 ] ) through the _ iraf _ routine _ ionic _ using the values of @xmath171  and @xmath172 [ ]  listed in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "since the collision strengths for c@xmath179 , derived by @xcite , are available only for @xmath172  @xmath660 k , we extrapolated them to lower temperatures in order to cover the @xmath172  range found for our sample pne .",
    "table  [ tab:4 ] shows the values we obtain for c@xmath179/h@xmath186 .",
    "the highest differences between our values of @xmath661 and the ones in the papers listed in table  [ tab:1 ] are found for hu  1 - 1 ( 0.35 dex ) and ic  4406 ( 0.23 dex ) .",
    "for the other pne the differences are lower than 0.15 dex .",
    "these disagreements are due to the different physical conditions adopted in the calculations , except for ic  4406 , for which the value given in @xcite is a typo , and their corrected value agrees with the one we derive ( y.  tsamis , private communication ) .    using the values of o@xmath179 from table  [ tab:2 ]",
    ", we calculate the c / o values listed in the third column of table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "because these values are based on cels located in the optical ( [ ] @xmath188 ) and in the ultraviolet ( ] @xmath659 ) , there are several important sources of uncertainty associated to them , namely , the adopted @xmath172 , the extinction correction , the normalization between ultraviolet and optical fluxes , and the aperture correction in extended nebulae .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the normalization of optical and ultraviolet fluxes are difficult to quantify .",
    "the other sources of uncertainty are discussed below .",
    "the correction for interstellar extinction is important , and the extinction law for the bulge pne , needed for some of our sample objects , is uncertain ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , the main effect of an error in the extinction coefficient will occur through its impact on the derived temperature .",
    "the determination of an accurate value of @xmath172  is a critical factor in obtaining reliable ionic abundances from cels , and the emissivities of ultraviolet cels are more dependent on @xmath172  than those of optical cels . as an example",
    ", consider an error of 500 k , which can arise easily from errors in the extinction correction , the flux calibration or the line measurements that will not necessarily appear in the quoted line intensity errors . at @xmath172  @xmath664",
    "k , this variation introduces a change of @xmath665 dex in c@xmath179/h@xmath186 and a change of @xmath666 dex in o@xmath179/h@xmath186 ; the final effect in the c@xmath179/o@xmath179 ratio will be around 0.1 dex .",
    "aperture corrections are needed in those nebulae that are more extended than the aperture of the international ultraviolet explorer ( @xmath667 arsec@xmath668 ) , or that were observed in the optical with a long slit at a single position ( as opposed to a long slit scanning the whole object ) .",
    "the scale factors applied by the different authors in our sample pne go up to 13 , with ngc  6720 ( angular diameter of 76 arcsec ) the pn with the highest aperture correction @xcite .",
    "we use here the ultraviolet fluxes provided by the different authors , already scaled and normalized by them .",
    "the uncertainties related to this procedure are difficult to estimate , but might reach a factor of 23 for objects like ngc  6720 .",
    "table  [ tab:4 ] shows the c@xmath179 abundances and the values of c / o based on cels and the icf of equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "we only present in this table the uncertainties associated with the final values of c / o .",
    "we consider an uncertainty of 0.2 dex in @xmath669 , based on the discussion above ( it could be higher for some objects , such as extended nebulae with important aperture corrections ) , which is added quadratically to the uncertainty in the icf computed from equations  ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) in @xcite .",

    "we do not observe the feature in ngc  40 , but this could be due to the different areas observed by _ iso _ ( @xmath3 440 arcsec@xmath668 , covering almost the whole nebula ) and _ spitzer _ ( @xmath3 248 arcsec@xmath668 ) .",

    ", a higher spectral resolution would show the presence or absence of pahs more clearly .",
    "the detection of pahs is not clear in some nebulae , in particular those with spectra of low spectral resolution , because of contamination with emission lines ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : dust_3 ] ) , the broad feature at 11.3 @xmath1 m is the pah feature most easily seen .",
    "hence we used the presence of this broad feature as the main criterion for the detection of pahs .",
    "originally , pahs were thought to appear only in those dust forming sources that are carbon - rich @xcite , but in recent years these molecules have also been observed in oxygen - rich agb and post - agb stars , and in oxygen - rich pne ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we do not see evidence for pahs , sic , nor amorphous silicates .",
    "we observe the broad features associated with amorphous silicates in 35 pne of the 27 pne with irs/_spitzer _ spectra in the adequate wavelength range ( see figs .",

    "some pne , like ngc  40 , ngc  2392 , and ngc  6210 , show a small bump around 1718 @xmath1 m , but this feature is likely to be related with problems in the overlap of the sh and lh spectra .",
    "finally , @xcite identified amorphous silicates in the _ iso _ spectra of ngc  6543 and , probably , in ngc  6153 .",
    "we also identify the crystalline silicate features around 23@xmath1 m , 27@xmath1 m , and 33 @xmath1 m in the irs spectra of 12 pne from the sample .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of crystalline silicates in ic  4846 and ngc  6818 due to the low resolution or poor signal - to - noise ratio of their spectra .",
    "@xcite used _ iso _ spectra and detected crystalline silicates in ngc  6543 , whereas they could not rule out their presence in ngc  6153 .",
    "therefore , 1316 nebulae from the 21 pne with available spectra in the required wavelength range show crystalline silicates .",
    "the three pne with amorphous silicates also show crystalline silicates .",
    "six out of the thirteen pne that show silicate features belong to the mixed - chemistry class , objects that show both silicates and pahs .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain the simultaneous presence of silicates and pahs in pne ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the preferred explanations is that the silicates were formed and ejected before the star experienced the third dredge - up , when it was still o - rich , whereas pahs form later @xcite . according to this scenario ,",
    "silicates are located in a o - rich disk / torus while pahs occupy a more recent c - rich outflow .",
    "this could explain the mixed chemistry of cn  1 - 5 , where me measure c / o  @xmath6 .",
    "however , this explanation is not valid for stars that remain o - rich during their whole evolution , either because the third dredge - up does not occur due to their low initial masses or because the effect of the third dredge - up is counteracted by the hot bottom burning process . in these pne",
    ", it might apply the explanation proposed by @xcite , in which the pahs form in an o - rich and dense torus after the co molecules are dissociated .",
    "the values of @xmath839 in our sample of pne go from 8.02 ( for the halo pn dddm  1 ) to 8.88 ( for ngc  6620 ) .",
    "if we consider the values of o / h found for the pne that have different dust features , they cover the ranges : 8.268.87 ( pahs ) , 8.268.68 ( sic or 30 @xmath1 m feature ) , 8.028.87 ( silicates ) , and 8.458.87 ( mixed - chemistry objects : silicates and pahs ) .",
    "thus the sample pne with silicate dust grains seem to arise from a broad population that includes the halo pn , dddm  1 , pne from the galactic disk , and objects that might belong to the bulge , like h  1 - 50 and m  2 - 31 @xcite .",
    "our pne with sic and the 30 @xmath1 m feature seem to arise from a more homogeneous population in the galactic disk ; only one of them , m  1 - 20 , might belong to the bulge .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite , who found that six of their compact galactic pne with c - rich dust features , for which they could estimate the dust temperature , follow a well defined sequence in their plots of dust temperature versus infrared luminosity or physical radii .",
    "@xcite conclude that this is an evolutionary sequence and that the progenitors of these pne covered a narrow range in initial mass and metallicity .",
    "the high oxygen abundances found for the mixed - chemistry pne also agree with the results of @xcite , since they found that these nebulae are concentrated towards the galactic center and are absent from the magellanic clouds .",
    "the range of iron depletions we find in our sample of pne covers about two orders of magnitude , suggesting differences in the formation and evolution of dust grains from one pn to another . as in @xcite , we explored possible correlations between the iron depletions and different nebular and stellar parameters such as the electron density , the nebular radius , the surface brightness , the effective temperature of the central star , or the nebular morphology . in agreement with @xcite , we do not find any obvious correlation .",
    "we investigate here if this large range of iron depletions is related to the type of dust grains found in the pn ( i.e. , c - rich or o - rich dust grains ) or to the dominant chemistry present in the ionized gas ( i.e. , if the computed c / o ratio is lower or greater than one ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : disc_1 ] we display the values of fe / o and the depletion factors for fe / o as a function of the c / o abundance ratios , derived from cels and rls , for all the pne in our sample with available data .",
    "note that the sample pne can have two , one , or no values for c / o ( depending on whether the required cels and rls are measured or not ) and hence not all the pne in table  [ tab:3 ] appear in figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] , and some objects only appear in the panels at the right ( left ) .",
    "we present the results for the values of fe / o derived with equations  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , but the values of fe / o implied by equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) lead to similar results .",
    "we also identify in figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] the pne showing dust features in their infrared spectra , as well as those with doubtful or no detection of dust features .",
    "note that , given the uncertainties related to the calculation of c / o from emission lines , the type of dust grains ( o - rich or c - rich excluding pahs ) might provide better information on whether the intrinsic value of c / o in the nebular gas is above 1 or not ( unless grain components like sic can form in slightly o - rich conditions , see * ? ? ?",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] show the pah identifications .",
    "the first studies on the relation between pahs and the c / o abundance ratios found a trend of increasing strength of these features as c / o increases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and it was suggested that these molecules are only present in pne with c / o  @xmath6 .",
    "here we find some pne with intense pah features and low c / o ratios , such as ngc  7026 or ngc  6439 .",
    "besides , pah emission is not restricted to pne with c / o  @xmath6 , in agreement with the idea that pah molecules may form both in c - rich and o - rich environments @xcite .",
    "we also see from this figure that pne with pahs are distributed over the whole range of iron depletions , suggesting that the presence of these molecules has no direct relation with the highest and lowest iron depletions found in the ionized gas .",
    "the middle panels of figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] identify those pne with sic or the broad feature at 30  @xmath1 m , usually associated with dust grains formed in a c - rich environment .",
    "most of these pne are located close to the region where c / o  @xmath6 .",
    "ngc  40 has a c / o value from rls that is not consistent within the errors with c / o  @xmath6 , but its c / o value from cels is consistent with c / o = 1 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite find in their simulations of terrestrial planet formation that solid sic can form when the c / o ratio is above 0.8 . in this case , the range of c / o ratios for nebulae with c - rich dust can be somewhat wider .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] show the pne with amorphous or crystalline silicates in their spectra .",
    "these dust features seem to be very common in our sample .",
    "all but one of those pne with silicate features have values of c / o that are compatible with an o - rich environment .",
    "cn  1 - 5 is the exception , showing silicates with a c / o value clearly above one , regardless of what lines are used in the abundance determination and regardless of the adopted icf .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the c@xmath179/o@xmath179 values derived from cels and rls are seriously wrong for this nebula .",
    "another option , already mentioned in   [ sec : dust ] , is that the computed c / o value in the ionized gas is correct , and the prominent silicate features are revealing an o - rich past where the silicate grains formed .    if we consider as c - rich those pne with sic or the 30  @xmath1 m feature and as o - rich those with silicates , we can see in figure  [ fig : disc_1 ] that both c - rich and o - rich pne cover a wide range of iron depletions . however , c - rich nebulae are not present in the region of lowest iron depletions ( highest gaseous iron abundances ) , whereas o - rich pne do not appear at the highest depletions .",
    "the pne with the highest iron depletions that have identifications of dust features are ic  418 and ngc  3242 , two pne with c - rich dust features and no silicates . on the other hand , the pne with the lowest depletions that also have identifications of dust features are cn  1 - 5 , dddm  1 , m  1 - 42 , and ngc  2392 , four pne that show silicates and no c - rich dust features . in order to check",
    "whether this finding is due to small - number statistics , we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test that compares the distributions of iron depletions for c - rich and o - rich pne ( as defined by the presence of sic or the 30  @xmath1 m feature , versus the presence of silicates ) . using the values of fe / o in figure  [ fig : disc_1 ]",
    "we find that the p - value ( the probability of finding different distributions of fe / o for c - rich and o - rich pne if both arise from the same distribution ) is 4% .",
    "we also performed the ks test using the values of fe / o implied by equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and the values of fe / h implied by both ionization correction schemes , finding probabilities in the range 0.2% to 7% , with the values of fe / h implying the lowest values ( 0.2% and 1% ) .",
    "therefore , the difference is significant at the 0.27% level .    an independent way to test this relation of iron depletions with c / o",
    "is by studying the correlation between the iron abundances and the values derived for c / o .",
    "we studied this correlation considering the two values of fe / h and fe / o implied by the two different ionization correction schemes we use , and the values of c / o implied by either cels or rls ( making a total of 8 cases ) .",
    "we find weak spearman rank correlation coefficients , in the range @xmath645 to @xmath840 , and p - values that go from 0.1% ( for iron abundances derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) and c / o values implied by rls ) to 30% .",
    "hence , the relation between iron depletions and c / o abundances , although weak , seems to be significant . this relation could arise from changes in the composition of dust grains for environments characterized by different values of c / o .",
    "our results do not agree with the model results of @xcite for dust production in agb stars .",
    "whereas most of our objects show high iron depletion factors , their calculations only show large degrees of condensation for iron , above 80% , in objects where the value of c / o is extremely close to 1 ( see their figs .  a.3 and a.4 ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , who find strong depletions of elements like fe and ca in the circumstellar envelope of an agb carbon star , adsorption of metals at the surface of the dust grains may be as important as the initial dust condensation processes considered by the models of dust formation in stellar envelopes .",
    "we have studied a sample of 56 pne , belonging to the galactic bulge , the halo , and the disk .",
    "the nebulae have available optical spectra of good quality and we constrain their iron abundances using [ ] lines and the ionization correction scheme derived by @xcite .",
    "the iron depletion factors we find imply that most of the studied pne have less than 10% of their iron atoms in the gas , the missing iron atoms are presumably condensed into dust grains .",
    "we have calculated the c / o abundance ratios using both optical rls ( for 49 pne ) and ultraviolet and optical cels ( for 39 pne ) .",
    "the differences between the two estimates reach @xmath760 dex in some objects .",
    "most of the sample pne show c / o  @xmath0 which , according to theoretical models , indicates that they could either descend from stars with masses below @xmath841 m@xmath762 or from stars with masses above 45 m@xmath762 .",
    "those pne with c / o  @xmath6 are probably the result of intermediate mass stars .",
    "we have also studied the infrared spectra of the pne with available data in order to identify the following features : pahs , sic , the broad band at 30 @xmath1 m , and amorphous and crystalline silicates .",
    "we find pahs in 1214 of the 33 pne with infrared spectra .",
    "the presence of these features is not restricted to pne with c / o  @xmath6 .",
    "silicates are found in 1316 pne ; sic and/or the 30 @xmath1 m feature , which is also associated with c - rich environments , in 79 objects .",
    "the presence of silicates and sic or the 30 @xmath1 m feature does not agree in all cases with the values of c / o derived from emission lines , maybe reflecting the uncertainties related to the determination of the c / o abundance ratio .",
    "note also that the c / o value we measure can be affected by the depletion of c or o atoms into dust grains .",
    "the oxygen abundances , @xmath839 , found for the pne that have different dust features cover the ranges : 8.268.87 ( pahs ) , 8.268.68 ( sic or 30 @xmath1 m feature ) , 8.028.87 ( silicates ) , and 8.458.87 ( mixed - chemistry objects : silicates and pahs ) .",
    "therefore , the sample pne with silicate dust grains seem to arise from a broad population that includes our halo pn , pne from the galactic disk , and objects that might belong to the bulge .",
    "our pne with sic and the 30 @xmath1 m feature seem to arise from a more homogeneous population in the galactic disk , while the mixed - chemistry objects arise from pne of relatively high metallicities , results that agree with those found by @xcite using measurements of the dust temperature and the distribution in the galaxy of their sample objects .",
    "we find a relation between the iron depletions and the type of chemistry in the nebulae , c - rich or o - rich .",
    "both c - rich and o - rich pne cover a wide range of iron depletions , but the pne with the highest iron depletions have c - rich dust features ( sic and/or the 30 @xmath1 m band ) whereas those pne with the lowest iron depletions have silicates in their infrared spectra . in accordance with this result , we find a weak but significant anticorrelation between the iron abundances and the c / o abundance ratios derived from emission lines .",
    "some kind of correlation is expected from the different molecules and dust compounds that should form in environments with different values of c / o .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments that helped to improved the paper .",
    "we acknowledge support from mexican conacyt grants 50359-f and 131610-f .",
    "we have used nasa s astrophysics data system , and the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
