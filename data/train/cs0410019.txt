    "assessing the performances of finite - blocklength iterative coding systems is an important open issue in modern coding theory .",
    "a particular case of such a task consists in the study of low - density parity - check code ( ldpc ) ensembles , when used for communicating over the binary erasure channel @xmath0 .",
    "a consistent effort has been devoted to this case , with the hope of a positive feedback on the general problem  @xcite .",
    "some lessons can be drawn from the results obtained so far :    * approximate ! * while density evolution ( de ) provides exact thresholds in the large blocklength limit , there is little hope to compute exact performances ( bit or block error rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) at finite blocklength @xmath1 . for the @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are determined by a set of recursions @xcite whose evaluation has complexity @xmath8 .",
    "however the exponent @xmath9 grows with the irregularity of the ensemble ( more precisely , with the number of probabilistically inequivalent types of node in the tanner graph ) .",
    "given the large degree of irregularity necessary for approaching capacity , an exact calculation becomes prohibitive already for moderate blocklengths",
    ". the situation can unlikely be simpler for more general channel models .",
    "it is therefore crucial to develop approximate estimates of finite - length performances .",
    "* small error events . * consider , for the sake of simplicity , communication over @xmath0 using an ldpc ensemble . below the threshold @xmath10 for iterative decoding , the typical size of error events ( the number of erased bits after decoding ) is of order @xmath11 . above threshold ,",
    "the same size is of order @xmath1 ( the bit error probability is finite ) .",
    "one can regard the failure of iterative decoding at @xmath10 as due to the divergence ( on the @xmath12 scale ) of the size of typical error events .",
    "the probability of small error events is readily evaluated through the union bound . for a code with minimum variable degree @xmath13 , the expected number of error events involving @xmath14 bits is @xmath15 , as long as @xmath14 is kept finite in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "if @xmath17 , this quantity decreases by a factor @xmath1 ( or more ) each time @xmath14 increases by one .",
    "this suggests that only very small error events have a non - negligible probability : their contribution can be computed exactly  @xcite and compares favorably with recursive calculations or numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , in the vast majority of elements from the ensemble , such error events are strictly absent .",
    "if @xmath18 , the dominating error events involve uniquely degree 2 variable nodes , and have the topology of cycles in the tanner graph .",
    "the number of such structures is @xmath19 : one can chose both the variables and the check nodes involved .",
    "their probability is @xmath20 , where we denoted by @xmath21 the fraction of variable nodes having degree @xmath22 .",
    "in fact : the variables must be erased ( which explains the factor @xmath23 ) ; they must have degree 2 ( factor @xmath24 ) ; and they must be connected to the previously chosen check nodes ( factor @xmath25 ) . unlike in the case",
    "@xmath17 , the resulting typical size depends upon @xmath26 .",
    "detailed calculations can be carried on for cycle ensembles : one finds @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the divergence of error events size ` drives ' the failure of iterative decoding above @xmath10 .    * large error events . *",
    "computing the probability of small ( i.e. finite in the @xmath16 limit ) error events is a conceptually straightforward task .",
    "while in the case @xmath17 one has do the computation for just a few small structures , if degree - two nodes are present , an infinite number of contributions must be summed over . in both cases ,",
    "this approach yields a simple and accurate description of the error probability in the noise regime for which @xmath29 .",
    "this is the so - called _ error - floor _ region .    what about the _ waterfall _ region ?",
    "the description in terms of finite - size error events can not account for this regime .",
    "take for instance the case @xmath17 .",
    "as long as the error size @xmath14 is finite , its probability decreases rapidly with @xmath14 .",
    "the breakdown of iterative decoding at @xmath10 can therefore be ascribed uniquely to error events whose size diverges with @xmath1 .",
    "analogously , for cycle ensembles the typical size of finite error events diverges at @xmath10 .",
    "this conclusion can be extended to general irregular ensembles : in order to describe the waterfall region , large error events have to be taken into account .",
    "this remark implies several theoretical problems .",
    "first of all , no enumeration of all the configurations ( by this we mean stopping sets in the @xmath0 case , and any suitable generalization for other channels ) responsible for errors is possible in the waterfall regime .",
    "in fact , it is likely that the number of relevant ` topologies ' diverges with the blocklength .",
    "second , we can not think of the set of wrongly decoded bits as the union of several small ` error events ' , which are probabilistically independent . in more practical terms :",
    "the union bound is not a reliable tool in this regime .    yet , as optimized ensembles approach capacity , controlling the waterfall region is of utmost interest .",
    "we developed an approach to this problem for the @xmath0 case , which yields extremely satisfactory results .",
    "the methods are complementary to the stopping - sets analysis and build upon the description of iterative decoding by luby et al .",
    "although the extension to general channel models is likely to require a considerable effort , one can learn a general lesson about which kind of characterization can be hoped for in the waterfall regime .",
    "consider , for the sake of simplicity the case of @xmath17 .",
    "we find that there exists a non - negative constant @xmath30 and some non - negative function @xmath31 so that @xmath32 where the @xmath16 limit is taken by keeping @xmath33 fixed .",
    "in other words , if one plots @xmath34 as a function of @xmath35 then , for increasing @xmath1 these finite - length curves are expected to converge to some function @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath31 decreases smoothly from @xmath11 to @xmath36 as its argument changes from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this means that all finite - length curves are , to first order , scaled versions of some _ mother _ curve @xmath31",
    ". it might be helpful to think of the threshold @xmath39 as the zero order term in a taylor series .",
    "then the above scaling , if correct , represents the first order term .",
    "in fact , one can even refine the analysis to include higher order terms and write @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some positive real number and @xmath42 is the second order correction term .    for ensembles with @xmath18 ( and in particular , for ensembles",
    "whose threshold is fixed by the local stability condition ) eq .",
    "( [ equ : generalfss ] ) must be properly generalized .",
    "we refer to ref .",

    "( 0,0 )   scaling of @xmath43 for transmission over bawgnc@xmath44 and a quantized version of belief propagation decoding implemented in hardware .",
    "the threshold for this combination is @xmath45 .",
    "the blocklengths @xmath1 are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the solid curves represent the simulated ensemble averages .",
    "the dashed curves are computed according to the refined scaling law ( [ equ : refscalingblock ] ) with scaling parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these parameters were fitted to the empirical data.,title=\"fig : \" ]    ( 367.5,231 ) ( 13,223)(0,0)@xmath54 ( 380,8)(0,0)[r]@xmath55    it is worth making a couple of remarks .",
    "first of all , the form ( [ equ : generalfss ] ) , wherever it can be argued to hold , allows a precise definition of what is meant by `` waterfall '' region .",
    "this is going to be the interval of channel parameters @xmath56 for some positive constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "second , even in cases in which the function @xmath31 can not be determined analytically , the statement ( [ equ : generalfss ] ) is highly informative , since it reduces a two - variable function to a single - variable one .",
    "moreover , in several cases , @xmath31 can be efficiently given in terms of a few parameters .",
    "this opens the way to empirical applications of eq .",
    "( [ equ : generalfss ] ) . an example",
    "is provided in fig .",
    "( [ fig : scalingawgnquant ] ) .",
    "finite - length optimization of code ensembles is an issue of great practical relevance .",
    "we think that the scaling description ( [ equ : generalfss])-([equ : generalreffss ] ) may be an important step towards a mathematically well - founded solution of this task .",
    "a first numerical investigation of finite - size scaling for ldpc codes was presented in ref .",
    "earlier accounts of the present work appeared in @xcite , and a complete version in @xcite .",
    "related ideas were put forward by lee and blahut @xcite and zemor and cohen @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider standard ldpc@xmath59 ensembles . here",
    "@xmath1 is the blocklength , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the degree distribution of ( respectively ) variable and check nodes from an edge perspective . for the sake of simplicity , we shall often refer to _ regular _ ensembles with left degree @xmath22 , and right degree @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding degree distributions read @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in order to analyze the iterative decoder ,",
    "we adopt the point of view introduced by luby et al . in @xcite . according to this description ,",
    "the algorithm proceeds as follows ( we assume the all - zeros codeword to be transmitted and describe the action of the algorithm on the tanner graph ) .",
    "given the received message , the decoder deletes all received variable nodes and their incident edges . in this way one arrives at a _",
    "residual _ graph .",
    "the decoder proceeds now in an iterative fashion . if the residual graph contains no degree - one check nodes the decoding process stops .",
    "otherwise , the decoder randomly chooses one such degree - one check node and deletes it together with the corresponding variable node and all its incident edges . in this way a new residual graph results and a new iteration starts .",
    "decoding is successful if all the graph gets deleted by this procedure . in the opposite case ,",
    "the decoder gets stucked in a stopping set .",
    "the state of the algorithm after a fixed number of iterations can be entirely described by a finite set of integers , providing the number of variable and check nodes of a given degree .",
    "let us denote this vector of integers by @xmath65 . for regular ensembles",
    "the situation is even simpler : it is enough to specify the total number of variable nodes @xmath66 , the number of degree - one check nodes @xmath67 , and the number of check nodes of higher degree @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath69 . notice that , when decoding starts , these variables are of order @xmath70 .",
    "each iteration of the decoding procedure described above , amounts to a finite increment ( or decrement ) in these variables .",
    "in particular , for the regular case : @xmath66 decreases by one ; @xmath67 decreases by one ( the check node chosen at that iteration ) and increases by the number of degree - two check nodes which are neighbors of the newly deleted variable ; @xmath68 decreases by this last quantity .",
    "it is easy to realize that the probability distribution of these increments ( decrements ) depends upon @xmath71 only on the scale @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely the probability of a variation @xmath72 is ( up to @xmath73 corrections ) a smooth function of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "call @xmath77 the state after @xmath78 iterations , and consider the change in state @xmath79 in a time @xmath80 . if @xmath80 is much smaller than @xmath70 , then also @xmath81 .",
    "therefore each step in the interval @xmath82 $ ] is independent and identically distributed .",
    "if @xmath80 is nevertheless much larger than 1 , we can apply the central limit theorem to deduce that @xmath83 is , with good approximation , a multi - dimensional gaussian variable with mean of order @xmath80 and standard deviation of order @xmath84 .",
    "since , for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , one can , to a first approximation neglect fluctuations .",
    "this was the essential step taken in @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that @xmath77 concentrates around its average value @xmath87 , with @xmath88 solution of the a set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath89 these are nothing but the density evolution equations .",
    "they are integrated with an initial condition depending upon the erasure probability .",
    "a typical decoding trajectory is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : covarianceevolution ] . for @xmath90 , it reaches the @xmath91 point before touching the @xmath92 plane : decoding is successful . for @xmath93",
    ", it touches the @xmath92 plane before the @xmath91 point : a stopping set has been reached .",
    "once the typical trajectory is found , one can compute distribution of @xmath94 .",
    "the procedure is conceptually simple .",
    "consider @xmath95 for some fixed @xmath96 and decompose the interval @xmath97 $ ] into sub - intervals of size @xmath80 , with @xmath98 . within each sub - interval",
    "we can apply the argument outlined above to show that @xmath83 is gaussian with standard deviation of order @xmath99 .",
    "gluing together @xmath100 such intervals we deduce that @xmath94 is gaussian with standard deviation of order @xmath101 .",
    "this has immediate implications for the decoding performances .",
    "in fact , as soon as the average trajectory passes within a distance of order @xmath101 _ above _ the @xmath92 plane , fluctuations will produce a finite probability of hitting the plane .",
    "vice - versa , if the average trajectory passes @xmath101 _ below _ the @xmath92 plane , decoding can nevertheless be successful with finite probability . recall that the erasure probability sets the initial condition .",
    "it is easy to realize that a change @xmath102 in the channel parameter implies a change of order @xmath103 in the average trajectory @xmath104 . at threshold ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath77 is just tangent to the @xmath92 plane .",
    "this implies that the failure probability is strictly between @xmath36 and @xmath11 as long as @xmath106 .",
    "this suggest that the scaling form ( [ equ : generalfss ] ) holds with @xmath107 .",
    "the above argument can be made both quantitative and rigorous : the procedure for computing gaussian fluctuations around the typical trajectory has been named _ covariance evolution _",
    "@xcite and it is not much harder than usual _ density evolution_. we refer to the next section for a more precise account of the results .",
    "unhappily , when compared with detailed simulations , or with exact computations obtained from recursion relations , the results are not very accurate .",
    "the reason lies in some subtle effect that produces sizeable corrections of the form ( [ equ : generalreffss ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath108 : this implies large corrections even for quite large blocklengths ( @xmath1 in the range @xmath109 ) .",
    "since it turns out that @xmath110 , the same corrections can be attributed to a _ finite - length shift _ of the iterative threshold : @xmath111 with a positive ( ensemble - dependent ) constant @xmath112 .",

    "both @xmath117 and @xmath78 are typically of order @xmath1 , and the increment probabilities of @xmath117 depends smoothly on @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "finally , the average trajectory @xmath121 has a minimum at @xmath113 , with @xmath122 , and @xmath123 near the minimum . in other words",
    "the minimum is ` non - degenerate ' .",
    "this is the situation for iterative decoding at @xmath124 under mild conditions on the code ensemble .",
    "we want to compute the ` failure ' probability , @xmath125 i.e. the probability for the trajectory to touch the @xmath126 plane , which corresponds to the block error probability in the decoding problem .    within a first approximation @xmath127 is at any time a gaussian variable with mean @xmath121 and standard deviation of order @xmath101 . the failure probability can be estimated as the probability for @xmath128 . since @xmath129 , we get @xmath130 .",
    "the crucial point is now that , even if @xmath131 , the trajectory has some probability for touching the @xmath126 plane either for @xmath132 or for @xmath133 .",
    "what matters is clearly the location of the minimum @xmath114 .",
    "the trajectory does not touch the @xmath126 plane if and only if @xmath134 .",
    "let us now try to estimate the position of the minimum @xmath114 .",
    "this is the outcome of a balance between two competing forces .",
    "on the one hand , the average trajectory is bent upward and forces @xmath114 to be close to @xmath113 .",
    "this yields a contribution to @xmath135 which is of order @xmath136 . on the other hand , by moving away from @xmath113 one can take advantage of fluctuations , @xmath137-[x_{\\rm av}(\\ell)-x_{\\rm av}(\\ell_*)]$ ] which are typically of order @xmath138 .",
    "the location of @xmath114 is estimated by balancing these two effects : @xmath139 .",
    "we get therefore @xmath140 the above argument implies that the failure probability is slightly larger than @xmath141 .",
    "one can in fact fail either if @xmath142 ( and this happens with probability @xmath141 ) , or if @xmath143 because , in this case , @xmath144 can be @xmath116 below @xmath145 .",
    "what is the probability of @xmath143 ?",
    "we know that @xmath145 is , with good approximation a gaussian variable with mean @xmath36 and standard deviation @xmath146 .",
    "therefore the probability is of order @xmath147 .",
    "we find therefore the estimate @xmath148 remarkably , the constant @xmath149 can be calculated exactly  @xcite and depends uniquely upon the transition probabilities near @xmath145 .",
    "once the axes @xmath117 and @xmath78 have been properly scaled @xmath149 is given by an integral expression in terms of airy functions .    when adapted to the coding problem , the above argument",
