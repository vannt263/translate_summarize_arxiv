    "wave is ubiquitous , it arises in many branches of science , engineering and industry ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it is significant to geoscience , petroleum engineering , telecommunication , and defense industry .",
    "mathematically , wave propagation problems are described by hyperbolic partial differential equations , and the progress of solving wave - related application problems has largely depended on the progress of developing effective methods and algorithms to solve their governing partial differential equations . among many wave - related application problems , those dealing with high frequencies ( or large wave numbers )",
    "wave propagation are most difficult to solve numerically because they are strongly indefinite and non - hermitian and their solutions are very oscillatory .",
    "these properties in turn make it very difficult to construct stable numerical schemes under practical mesh constraints .",
    "furthermore , high frequency ( or large wave number ) requires to use very fine meshes in order to resolve highly oscillatory waves , and the use of fine meshes inevitably gives rise huge , strongly indefinite , ill - conditioned , and non - hermitian ( algebraic ) systems to solve .",
    "all these difficulties associated with high frequency ( large wave number ) wave computation still remain to be resolved and are not mathematically well understood in high dimensions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , although considerable amount of progresses have been made in the past thirty years ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the simplest prototype wave scattering problem is the following acoustic scattering problem ( with time dependence @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , a bounded lipschitz domain , denotes the scatterer and @xmath8 denotes the imaginary unit .",
    "@xmath9 is a given positive ( large ) number and known as the wave number .",
    "@xmath10 is the incident wave .",
    "equation is the well - known helmholtz equation and condition is the sommerfeld radiation condition at the infinity .",
    "boundary condition implies that the scatterer is sound - soft .    to compute the solution of the above problem , due to ( finite ) memory and speed limitations of computers",
    ", one needs first to formulate the problem as a finite domain problem .",
    "two major approaches have been developed for the task in the past thirty years .",
    "the first approach is _ boundary integral methods _",
    "( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) and the other one is _ artificial boundary condition methods _ ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) . in the case of boundary integral methods ,",
    "one converts the original differential equation into a ( complicate ) boundary integral equation on the boundary @xmath11 of the scatterer @xmath12 . clearly , the trade - off is that the original simple differential equation could not be retained in the conversion . on the other hand ,",
    "artificial boundary condition methods solve the given differential equation on a truncated computational domain by imposing suitable artificial boundary conditions on the outer boundary of the computational domain .",
    "artificial boundary condition methods can be divided into two groups .",
    "one group of the methods use sharp artificial boundaries ( i.e. , the boundary has zero width ) , appropriate boundary conditions , which are called  _ absorbing boundary conditions _ \" , then are imposed on the boundaries ( cf .",
    "the second group of artificial boundary condition methods allow the artificial boundaries to have non - zero width , such fatten boundaries are called absorbing layers , where the artificial boundary conditions are usually constructed in the form of differential equations which replace the original wave equations in the absorbing layers . the methods of this second group are called  _ pml ( perfectly matched layer ) methods _ \" ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt the absorbing boundary condition approach for problem . extension of the results of this paper to the pml formulations will be given elsewhere .",
    "specifically , in this paper we consider the following helmholtz problem : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a polygonal / polyhedral domain , which is often taken as a @xmath15-rectangle in applications .",
    "@xmath16 , hence , @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath19 .",
    "the robin boundary condition is known as the first order absorbing boundary condition ( cf .",
    "we remark that the case @xmath20 also arises in applications either as a consequence of frequency domain treatment of waves or when time - harmonic solutions of the scalar wave equation are sought ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for many years",
    ", the finite element method ( and other type methods ) has been widely used to discretize the helmholtz equation ( [ e1.1 ] ) with various types of boundary conditions ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the reference therein ) .",
    "it is well known that in every coordinate direction , one must put some minimal number of grid points in each wave length @xmath21 in order to resolve the wave , that is , the mesh size @xmath1 must satisfy the constraint @xmath22 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath23 grid points are used in a wave length , which is often referred as the  rule of thumb \" . however , this  rule of thumb \" was proved rigorously not long ago by babuka _",
    "@xcite only in the one - dimensional case ( called the _ preasymptotic error analysis _ ) .",
    "the main difficulty of the analysis is caused by the strong indefiniteness of the helmholtz equation which in turn makes it hard to establish stability estimates for the finite element solution under the  rule of thumb \" mesh constraint . in @xcite , babuka _ et al _ also showed that the @xmath2-error bound for the finite element solution contains a pollution term that is related to the loss of stability with large wave numbers .",
    "later , babuka _ et al _ addressed the question whether it is possible to reduce the pollution effect in a series of papers ( cf .",
    "chapter 4 of @xcite and the reference therein ) .",
    "it should be noted that under the stronger mesh condition that @xmath24 is sufficiently small , optimal ( with respect to @xmath1 ) and quasi - optimal ( with respect to @xmath0 ) error estimates for finite element approximations of the helmholtz problem were established early by aziz and kellogg in @xcite and douglas , _ et al _ in @xcite using the so - called schatz argument @xcite ( also see chapter 5 of @xcite ) , and a similar result was also obtained in @xcite using an operator perturbation argument .",
    "the work of @xcite shows that in the @xmath25-d case , due to the pollution effect , the finite element solution for the helmholtz problem ( [ e1.1])-([e1.3 ] ) deteriorates as the wave number becomes large if the practical mesh condition @xmath26 is used .",
    "the situation in the high dimensions is expected to be the same ( at least not better ) although , to the best of our knowledge , no such a rigorous analysis is known in the literature .",
    "the detailed analysis of @xcite also shows that the pollution effect is inherent in the finite element method and is caused by the deterioration of stability of the helmholtz operator as the wave number @xmath0 becomes large . in order to minimize or eliminate ( if possible ) the pollution and to obtain more stable and more accurate approximate solutions for helmholtz - type problems with large wave numbers ,",
    "various nonstandard and generalized galerkin methods have been proposed lately in the literature .",
    "these methods can be categorized into two groups .",
    "the first group of methods use nonstandard or stabilized discrete variational forms to approximate the helmholtz operator so that the resulted discrete problems have better stability properties .",
    "methods in this group include galerkin - least - squares finite element methods @xcite , quasi - stabilized finite element methods @xcite , and discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite .",
    "the second group of methods abandon the use of piecewise polynomial trial and test functions and replace them by global polynomials or non - polynomial functions .",
    "methods in this group include spectral methods @xcite , generalized galerkin / finite element methods @xcite , partition of unity finite element methods @xcite , and meshless methods @xcite .",
    "we also note that another very different and intensively studied approach for high frequency wave computation is _ geometrical optics _ , which studies asymptotic ( nonlinear ) approximations of the helmholtz equation obtained when the frequency ( or wave number ) tends infinity .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for some recent developments in geometrical optics and its variants .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop some interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods for problem  in high dimensions .",
    "the focus of the paper is to establish the rigorous stability and error analysis , in particular , the preasymptotic error analysis . for the ease of presentation and to better present ideas",
    ", we confine ourselves to only consider the case of linear element in this paper .",
    "such a restriction is also due to the consideration that we shall present @xmath27-discontinuous galerkin methods for problem  in a forth coming paper @xcite which extends the work of this paper to high order elements .",
    "compared with existing dg methods for the helmholtz equation in the literature , the novelties of our interior penalty discontinuous galerkin methods include the following : first , our mesh - dependent sesquilinear forms penalize not only the jumps of the function values across the element edges / faces but also the jumps of the normal and tangential derivatives . recall that penalizing the jumps of the normal ( and tangential ) derivatives helps but is not essential for the success of ipdg methods in the case of coercive elliptic problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , however , it contributes critically to the stability of the ipdg methods of this paper .",
    "second , a small but vitally important idea of this paper is to take the penalty parameters as complex numbers of positive imaginary parts .",
    "this idea also contributes critically to the stability of the ipdg methods of this paper . as a result ,",
    "essentially and practically no constraint is imposed on the penalty parameters .",
    "since the helmholtz problem is a non - hermitian and an indefinite linear problem , as expected , the crucial and the most difficult part of the whole analysis is to establish the stability estimates ( i.e. , a priori estimates ) for the numerical solutions . to the end , the cruxes of our analysis are to establish and to make use of a local version of the rellich identity ( for the laplacian ) and to mimic the stability analysis for the pde solutions given in @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath28 is star - shaped with respect to a point @xmath29 .",
    "the key idea is to use the special test function @xmath30 ( defined element - wise ) , which is a valid candidate for any ipdg method .",
    "we remark that the same technique was successfully employed by shen and wang in @xcite to carry out the stability and error analysis for the spectral galerkin approximation of the helmholtz problem .    in the past fifteen years",
    ", dg methods have received a lot attentions and undergone intensive studies by many people . as is well known now",
    ", dg methods have several advantages over other types of numerical methods .",
    "for example , the trial and test spaces are very easy to construct , they can naturally handle inhomogeneous boundary conditions and curved boundaries ; they also allow the use of highly nonuniform and unstructured meshes , and have built - in parallelism which permits coarse - grain parallelization .",
    "in addition , the fact that the mass matrices are block diagonal is an attractive feature in the context of time - dependent problems , especially if explicit time discretizations are used .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for a detailed account on dg methods for coercive elliptic and parabolic problems .",
    "in addition to the advantages listed above , the results of this paper also demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of dg methods for strongly indefinite problems , which was not well understood before .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec-2a ] ,",
    "notation and some preliminaries are described and cited . in particular , the sharp ( with respect to @xmath0 ) stability constant estimates of @xcite for the solution of problem  in high dimensions were recalled .",
    "these estimates are critical for obtaining explicit dependence of the error bounds on the wave number @xmath0 . in section  [ sec-2 ] ,",
    "the ipdg methods of this paper are formulated .",
    "both symmetric and non - symmetric ipdg methods are constructed .",
    "however , since the helmholtz equation and its solution are complex - valued , the non - symmetric terms in the ipdg sesquilinear form do not cancel each other when two arguments of the form are taken to be the same function .",
    "instead , their difference is a pure imaginary quantity .",
    "this is a main difference between non - symmetric ipdg for coercive elliptic problems and for indefinite helmholtz type problems . as a result ,",
    "the penalty parameters need to be chosen as complex numbers with positive imaginary parts to ensure the stability in both symmetric and non - symmetric ipdg methods .",
    "section  [ sec - sta ] devotes to stability analysis for the ipdg methods proposed in section  [ sec-2 ] .",
    "it is proved that the proposed ipdg methods are stable ( hence well - posed ) without any mesh constraint . in section",
    "[ sec - err ] , using the stability result of section  [ sec - sta ] we derive optimal order ( with respect to @xmath1 ) error estimate in the broken @xmath2-norm and sub - optimal order estimate in the @xmath3-norm without any mesh constraint .",
    "the latter estimate improves to optimal order when the mesh size @xmath1 is restricted to the preasymptotic regime ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) .",
    "in particular , for appropriately chosen penalty parameters , it is shown that the error in the broken @xmath2-norm is bounded by @xmath31 if @xmath26 .",
    "numerical tests in section  [ sec - num ] suggest that the error in the broken @xmath2-norm may have a better bound @xmath32 and it is possible to tune the penalty parameters to significantly reduce the pollution error .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath24 is sufficiently small , optimal order ( with respect to @xmath1 ) error estimate in the broken @xmath2-norm can be derived by using the schatz argument as done in @xcite . in section [ sec - num ] , we present some numerical experiments to gauge our theoretical error estimates , to numerically examine the pollution effect in the error bounds , and to test the performance of the proposed ipdg methods .",
    "the standard space , norm and inner product notation are adopted .",
    "their definitions can be found in @xcite . in particular ,",
