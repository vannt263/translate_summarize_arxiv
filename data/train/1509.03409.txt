    "gauge - higgs unification ( ghu ) model is a candidate of the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in higher dimensional space - time with compactified extra dimensions .",
    "it is one of the models with large extra dimensions @xcite . in general ghu models",
    "there are infinite number of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the fields in higher dimensional space - time , which correspond to infinite number of discretized momenta in extra dimensions .",
    "the kk zero modes , which correspond to the states with zero momenta in extra dimensions , are massless in low - energy effective theory in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the lowest kk non - zero modes , `` the first kk modes '' , have masses of the order of compactification scales which are the inverse of the sizes of the extra dimensions .",
    "the kk zero mode of a gauge field is decomposed into two parts : the components of four - dimensional space - time consist a gauge field and the components of extra dimensions are scalar fields in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the explicit gauge symmetry breaking at the orbifold fixed points in the orbifold compactification of extra dimensions @xcite makes those scalar fields possible to be higgs doublet fields for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the basic idea of ghu model were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the quantum correction to the higgs mass is expected by the higher dimensional gauge invariance , since the higgs doublet field originates from higher dimensional gauge field @xcite .",
    "the basic idea for realistic mass hierarchy among quarks and leptons were proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is a non - trivial problem , because the higgs doublet field universally interacts with all the fermions due to the restriction of gauge principle . in @xcite quarks and leptons",
    "are assumed to be localized at orbifold fixed points , and the mixings with heavy extra fermions living in the whole space - time , `` bulk '' , generate their yukawa couplings with higgs doublet field . in @xcite quarks and leptons are introduced as bulk fermions , and their non - trivial distributions in extra dimensions due to their bulk masses generate yukawa couplings with higgs doublet field .",
    "in contrast to extensive studies on electroweak sector , less attention has been payed on the strong interaction or qcd sector . in view of the above idea of ghu model",
    "it is natural to assume that the gauge symmetry of the strong interaction is also the gauge symmetry in higher dimensional space - time .",
    "therefore , kk gluons naturally exist in ghu models in general .",
    "searching for the signals of kk gluons gives constraints to the models , because the masses of kk gluons are related to the sizes of compactified extra dimensions .",
    "the sizes of compact extra dimensions are directly connected to the energy scale of electroweak symmetry breaking in ghu models @xcite , and too small sizes of compact extra dimensions , or too heavy kk gluons , contradict the observed electroweak scale .",
    "although the constraints to the sizes of compact extra dimensions through the kk modes of electroweak gauge bosons have been discussed in @xcite , for example , ghu models can be tested in a complementary way from the physics of the strong interaction .",
    "notice that ghu models without kk gluon may be possible , and we do not discuss the constraints to these class of models in this paper .",
    "there have already been many investigations into the physics of kk gluons at the lhc , in case of flat compact spaces @xcite and in case of warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "systematic general studies of the massive color - octet vector boson productions have already been given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we specially concentrate on the physics of kk gluons in ghu models .",
    "we discuss the constraints to the mass of kk gluon in a simple benchmark ghu model in five - dimensional space - time with an orbifold compactification .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the strong interaction is introduced in the bulk as well as the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "this benchmark model is used as a starting point to discuss general nature of the kk gluon in ghu models , and the pursuit of realistic models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we investigate the signal of the first kk gluon state in dijet process , @xmath5 , at the parton level .",

    "it is natural that the gauge symmetry of the strong interaction is introduced in the bulk as well as the gauge symmetry which reduces to the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "the fifth dimension was compactified on @xmath4 orbifold .",
    "quarks , especially up and down quarks , were introduced as bulk fields with bulk masses so that their non - trivial configurations in fifth dimension could generate appropriate yukawa couplings with the higgs doublet field .",
    "though the couplings of the first kk gluon to up and down quarks depend on bulk masses , we argue that the values of the couplings are the same @xmath67 in good approximation , since the yukawa couplings of up and down quarks are very small .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the models in which quarks are localized at orbifold fixed points , it has been shown that the couplings of kk gluon with massless quarks are also @xmath67 @xcite . in our benchmark model",
    "we assumed that the couplings to the other four quarks were also the same value , by which we could start from wide resonance structures in dijet invariant mass distributions .",
    "the contribution of the first kk gluon in this benchmark model to the dijet invariant mass distributions at the lhc was investigated with various rapidity cuts and @xmath123 cuts in the parton level . in cases of the integrated luminosity of 25 @xmath128 and 100 @xmath128 we estimated signal - to - noise ratios , @xmath153 , with kinematical cuts of jet rapidity @xmath154 and @xmath122 and jet @xmath155 and @xmath119 gev .",
    "we found in this benchmark model that in case of the integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath128 the first kk gluon mass up to @xmath156 tev and @xmath157 tev could be excluded at @xmath158 level with rapidity cuts @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the results on the models of ghu was examined first by assuming that the couplings of four heavier quarks than up and down quarks did not couple with the first kk gluon . in case of the integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath128 the first kk gluon with mass up to @xmath161 tev and @xmath162 tev",
    "could be excluded at @xmath158 level with rapidity cuts @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "we further introduced a parameter @xmath141 in order to apply the results in the model with @xmath125 to general ghu models with kk gluons .",
    "the coupling between the first kk gluon with up and down quarks , @xmath67 , was replaced by @xmath163 , since it could depend on the physics of yukawa coupling generation .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios in the benchmark model were easily translated to those of the general models by multiplying the factor @xmath146 .",
    "we have investigated the minimum accessible values of @xmath141 corresponding to @xmath158 significance with various kk gluon masses and kinematical cuts .",
    "we found , for example , that @xmath164 is necessary to observe the signal of 6 tev first kk gluon with integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath130 under @xmath150 and @xmath165 gev .",
    "more detailed analysis beyond the parton level requires the techniques of monte carlo simulations .",
    "it could be possible that the constraint to the size of the compact space would be stronger than that was obtained from the effects of kk weak bosons",
    ". it would be interesting to clarify whether or not the obtained constraint contradicts to the observed electroweak scale in concrete promising ghu models .",
    "it is also important to investigate the strategy to distinguish the signal of kk gluons of ghu models from similar in other models .",
    "investigations into the width , the angular distributions of dijets and searching for the second kk gluon are possible strategies .",
    "we leave these issues to future research .",
