    "the pinning force has a threshold at @xmath1 , i.e. , it vanishes for @xmath7 and then starts with a `` critical '' exponent similar to a phase transition .",
    "our model realizes a general concept of local impurity pinning when the force exerted by the impurity on the periodic structure ( cdw in our case ) becomes multivalued and metastable states appear @xcite . in a single chain model",

    "the r.h.s . of ( [ 18c ] ) is just the difference in energy of these two states devided by @xmath97 .",
    "it is possible to give a more geometrical description of this process and the resulting force : above threshold the force from shifts of the cdw by less than @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 with @xmath101 ) is elastic .",

    "it runs over the bifurcation point ( @xmath106 and jumps to the upper branch starting at @xmath107 .",
    "this is clearly seen in the energy profile @xmath108    near @xmath1 one can use the perturbative results @xmath109 , @xmath110 to find    @xmath111    thus pinning sets in at the threshold @xmath1 with exponent @xmath112 .    for larger @xmath0",
    "the situation is more complicated since more metastable states exist .",
    "the averaging path now extends over @xmath113 periods in order to sample all metastable states .",
    "the jump is from @xmath114 to the point @xmath115 which gives the lowest energy .",
    "@xmath94 is that value on the curve @xmath116 that lies nearest to @xmath117 where @xmath118 has its absolute minimum .",
    "the energy difference is @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",

    "this leads to a saw  toothed structure of @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) .",

    "it is noted that the unscaled force ( [ 18 ] ) contains the pinning amplitude @xmath21 and does not saturate for @xmath133 as in larkin s model @xcite .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the pinning force is also found in the one  dimensional pinning model in @xcite and is a general feature of local impurity phase pinning @xcite .",
    "the relation of the pinning parameter @xmath0 to the usual measure of pinning strength will now be discussed . according to ( [ 8 ] ) and taking the isotropy scaling into account ,",
    "@xmath0 is given by :    @xmath134    the standard measure @xcite for impurity energy to elastic energy in an anisotropic three  dimensional cdw continuum is    @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the impurity concentration .",
    "the effective distance between pins is @xmath137 .",
    "thus @xmath138 is related to @xmath0 by    @xmath139    the applicability of the theory requires @xmath30 to be smaller than @xmath140 . using the values @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and an impurity concentration of one ppm",
    "the ratio @xmath143 is estimated as @xmath144 one can , nevertheless , conclude that the strong pinning limit in our model , @xmath145 , also requires large @xmath146 . weak pinning occurs for @xmath147 .",
    "the region @xmath148 where local pinning is absent thus is concealed by weak pinning which is ubiquitous in less than four dimensions .",
    "so far we have considered the case of full screening : there are enough thermally excited quasiparticles ( or normal carriers as in @xmath149 ) to completely screen out the coulomb forces between charge fluctuations associated with phase deformations .",
    "it is known that descreening stiffens the cdw .",
    "this stiffening of the cdw leads to a corresponding increase of the phason velocity which has been observed by neutron scattering @xcite and explained in @xcite as a descreening effect . in a simple approximation involving only the condensate fraction @xmath150",
    "one can define an effective stiffness constant    @xmath151    to take care of descreening within the elastic cdw model @xcite .",
    "following @xcite this is a reasonable approximation for @xmath152 ( @xmath153 : static transverse dielectric constant ) . in",
    "the opposite limit coulomb interactions require a different approach .",
    "the modified stiffness constant changes the pinning parameter @xmath0 according to    @xmath154    since a scaling in chain direction becomes necessary to maintain quasi isotropy .",
    "our earlier formulae hold with this replacement . when @xmath155 becomes less than unity in decreasing the temperature local impurity phase pinning stops .",
    "the singularity in the local pinning force at @xmath156 is likely to be masked by thermal fluctuations and by weak pinning .",
    "the fact that local pinning centers require a minimum strength to act as strong pins is possibly the reason for the following observation in @xcite : the cdw in @xmath157 doped @xmath149 which is fully screened due to a partially gapped fermi surface exhibits weak instead of the expected strong pinning .",
    "we want to point out the similarities and differences in our approach to larkin s model @xcite and fill in some additional information about it .",
    "larkin uses a single chain model @xcite with one impurity at @xmath158 .",

    "phases on neighbouring chains are set to zero which turns the interchain coupling into the sine  gordon type self interaction @xmath166 in ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "thus phases on different chains are independent .",
    "in contrast the phase varies slowly across the chains in our model , a case more appropriate to a screened situation .",
    "the low temperature or descreened limit is understood when the quasi ",
    "particle fraction @xmath167 is smaller than the coulomb coupling constant @xmath168 .",
    "3 .   the value @xmath169 of the coulomb coupling constant mentioned in sec . 5",
    "is fixed at 1/8 . in reality",
    "a smaller value holds because of @xmath170@xmath171 .    the model ( [ 28 ] )",
    "has uncharged dipole solutions for which the phase @xmath172 at the impurity obeys the matching condition @xmath173    @xmath174    this equation replaces our equation ( [ 11 ] ) . for any solution",

    "the model is thus characterized by one metastable state .",
    "the mechanism of pinning force generation for @xmath182 is precisely the same as discussed in sec",
