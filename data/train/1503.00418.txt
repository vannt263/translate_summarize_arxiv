    "geometric phases depend only on certain global geometric property of the evolution path , and thus are largely robust against local noises .",
    "this distinct feature makes them promising in implementing quantum computation in a fault - tolerant way @xcite and high - fidelity geometric quantum gates have been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "geometric phases can be classified by two types , i.e. , the abelian and non - abelian ones , quantum computation based on which are called geometric @xcite and holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "the implementation of quantum gates with geometric phases can be achieved by both adiabatic and non - adiabatic evolution . however , the main challenge of the adiabatic method is the long run time , which is comparable with the lifetime of typical qubits @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "non - adiabatic geometric gates should be more preferable .",
    "recently , non - adiabatic hqc has been proposed with three - level lambda systems @xcite with several experimental verifications of elementary gates for universal quantum computation @xcite . however , in such schemes , the upper excited state is resonantly coupled , and thus the limited lifetime of this state is the main challenge in practical experiments .    here , we propose to manipulate the polariton qubit in a non - adiabatic holonomic way .",
    "the polariton qubit is choose to be a subset of a v - configuration three - level system , which is formed by three dressed states in a typical circuit qed setup .",
    "moreover , due to the polaritonic nature of the qubit , the polariton qubit is shown to be robust against arbitrary low - frequency noise .",
    "finally , the non - adiabatic holonomic quantum gate can be constructed by external driven microwave fields .",
    "therefore , our scheme presents a non - adiabatic and geometric way of manipulating polariton qubits for robust on - chip quantum computation .",
    "we firstly consider implementing the proposed polariton qubit with a typical circuit qed setup @xcite , where a superconducting transmon qubit @xcite is capacitively coupled to a one - dimensional transmission line resonator ( 1d cavity ) .",
    "setting @xmath0 , the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the frequencies of qubit and cavity , respectively ; @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the ground and excited states of the transmon qubit",
    ". label @xmath7 as the fock state of the cavity , the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ jc ] ) is @xmath8 with its eigenvalue set to be @xmath9 . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , for @xmath10 , due to the transmon qubit - cavity interaction , each energy level is spitted into two , the eigenstates are    @xmath11    and corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath12 where @xmath13 with the detuning @xmath14 .",
    "the transition frequencies are    [ omega ] @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the transition frequencies between the same transmon states , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponds to the transitions with different transmon states .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of hamiltonian ( [ jc ] ) is constrained within the subspace with certain @xmath7 . for the zero- and one - excitation subspace , the three lowest eigenstates @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 form a v - configuration , and",
    "the latter two are defined as the polariton qubit , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we write the qubit states @xmath22 as @xmath23 in the following .",
    "the major decoherence source in superconducting qubits is the low - frequency noise @xcite .",
    "the three - level system we considered has better stability under low - frequency noises compared with conventional superconducting qubits .",
    "we first consider the influence of the transverse noise @xmath24 from a superconducting qubit on the polariton qubit .",
    "the low - frequency nature of the noise determines that it can not resonantly couplings the transitions @xmath25 of the polariton qubit .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 , i.e. , it also can not induce qubit states transition .",
    "therefore , the noise can be treated as static fluctuations with perturbation theory and the corrected eigenenergies of the qubit states , up to second order , are @xmath27 note that @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and thus will greatly simplified the caculation of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "we rewrite @xmath30 , and the correction energy of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is calculated to be    @xmath33    they can be represented by @xmath34 and @xmath35 as    [ deltae ] @xmath36,\\\\ { \\delta}e_{1,+}&=\\frac{a_x^2}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\omega_r+g}-\\frac{1}{\\omega_r - g-2g^2/(\\omega_r - g)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as @xmath37 , they can be approximated as @xmath38 and thus the correction of the qubit energy splitting is @xmath39 .",
    "qubit dephasing is determined by this correction and is significantly suppressed by a factor of @xmath40 , similar to the case of conventional superconducting qubits working at optimal points @xcite",
    ". however , the optimal points are not immune to longitudinal low - frequency noise , which couples to the qubit through diagonal matrix elements and thus generates a shift of the energy splitting .",
    "fortunately , projecting longitudinal low - frequency noise of the superconducting qubit into our polariton qubit space , it will also be transformed to the transverse type of noise , and thus has minor contribution to the decoherence of our polariton qubit , as the case discussed in the transverse noise .",
    "therefore , the polariton qubit considered here is protected from both transverse and longitudinal noises .",
    "this is in stark contrast to that of conventional superconducting qubits where the first - order perturbation always plays the leading role .",
    "this is ensured by polaritonic nature of the qubit as well as the symmetric energy spectrum , where although the perturbations may induce the coupling between qubit states and other energy levels , their contribution to the splitting energy are almost cancelled .",
    "we now proceed to deal with the manipulation of the polariton qubit with non - adiabatic holonomic gates . without loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath41 in our considered polariton qubit .",
    "when a transmon qubit is driven by suitable microwave fields , single - qubit quantum gates for the defined polariton qubit can be induced . considering that a transmon is driven by a microwave field as @xmath42 .",
    "it is shown that choosing suitable frequencies in @xmath43 , one can control the transitions between between different eigenstates @xcite . here , we are interested in the three lowest eigenstates , to keep only the couplings between states that form the v - configuration interaction , the driven field is chosen as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the @xmath46th component in the driven field with the frequency of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a prescribed phase difference .",
    "then , we write the full hamiltonian @xmath49 in the subspace spanned by \\{@xmath19 , @xmath50 , @xmath51}. note that this subspace is the eigenspace of @xmath52 , and thus it will be in a diagonalize matrix with the elements being its eigenvalues . meanwhile , as @xmath53 , the matrix elements of @xmath54 will be @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the full hamiltonian can be written as @xmath56    in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath52 , the driven fields can be written as @xmath57 setting @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the above hamiltonian reduces to @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the two step approximations are hold under the justification of the rotating wave approximation .",
    "the first one corresponds the omission of the oscillating terms with much larger frequencies ( @xmath63 )",
    ". the second one will be hold when @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the driven dynamics of the polariton qubit will be governed by @xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "in order to investigate the qubit dynamics under the above hamiltonian , we renormalize it to @xmath66 where the effective rabi frequency is @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ v ] ) are @xmath19 , @xmath69 which means that , in this eigenbasis , the dynamics of the three level system can be viewed as a resonate coupling between the states @xmath19 and @xmath70 while decouples from the `` dark '' state @xmath71 , as shown in fig .",
    "1c .    therefore , the evolution operator @xmath72 realizes the holonomic gate under certain conditions , the reason of which is explained as the following .",
    "first , in the qubit subspace , the qubit states evolve according to @xmath73 .",
    "when the duration of the hamiltonian should satisfies @xmath74 , the qubit states undergo cyclic evolution .",
    "second , at any time , @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "this justifies that @xmath77 meets the parallel - transport condition in the qubit states subspace , and thus the evolution is purely geometric .",
    "note that this condition is met due to the structure of the hamiltonian instead of the slow change of parameters in the adiabatic evolution case . under the above two conditions , projected the evolution operator onto the qubit space defines the holonomic gate .",
    "therefore , the non - adiabatic holonomic single - qubit gate can be obtained as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath48 can be controlled by the driven field , and thus arbitrary single - qubit gate can be obtained by choosing suitable parameters .",
    "for example , @xmath80 and @xmath81 implements the hadamard gate .     with the initial state of the polariton qubit being @xmath51 , where the red dashed and blue lines being plotted without and with decohenrence , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] [ fhgate ]",
    "the performance of this gate can be evaluated by considering the influence of dissipation using the quantum master equation of @xmath82 + \\frac \\kappa   2   \\mathcal{l}(a )   + \\frac{\\gamma_1}{2 } \\mathcal{l}(\\sigma^- ) + \\frac{\\gamma_2}{2 }   \\mathcal{l}(\\sigma_\\text{z}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the density matrix of the considered system , @xmath84 is the lindblad operator , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the decay rate of the cavity , the decay and dephasing rates of the qubits , respectively .",
    "we consider the hadamard gate as a typical example and modulate @xmath88 so that @xmath89 is well - satisfied to fulfil the requirement of @xmath90 in the derivation of hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . for @xmath91 ghz ,",
    "the cavity decay rate is @xmath92 khz @xcite and the capacitive transmon - cavity coupling strength can be @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath80 for the hadamard gate , @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , for a planar transmon qubit couples to a transmission - line resonator can , relaxation and coherence times of 44 and 20 @xmath95s are reported @xcite , which leads to @xmath96 khz and @xmath97 khz .",
    "as @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are all on the same order , for simplicity , we treat them equally as @xmath98 khz .",
    "suppose the qubit is initially in the state of @xmath51 , we evaluate this gate by the fidelity defined by @xmath99 with @xmath100 being the ideally final state under hadamard gate .",
    "we have obtained a high fidelity of @xmath101 at @xmath102 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the red dashed and blue lines are plotted without and with decohenrence , respectively . note that to justify our theoretical treatment , we faithfully simulate the quantum process using the original full hamiltonian @xmath103 in eq .",
