    "in recent years , the lowest - lying octet baryon spectrum has been studied on the lattice with @xmath2 setups by a number of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) collaborations  @xcite@xcite . at present",
    ", most lqcd calculations still need to adopt larger than physical light - quark masses and relatively small volumes .",
    "therefore , the obtained lattice results have to be extrapolated to the physical world by performing the so - called  chiral extrapolation \"  @xcite@xcite and taking into account finite - volume corrections ( fvcs )  @xcite .    baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) , as an effective field theory , provides a useful framework to perform such extrapolations . in the past decades , the ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "octet baryon masses have been studied extensively  @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , one found that in the su(3 ) sector , the convergence of bchpt is slow . on the other hand , up to now , a simultaneous description of lqcd data with finite - volume effects taken into account self - consistently is still missing .",
    "such a study is necessary for a clarification of the convergence problem and for testing the consistency between different lqcd simulations .",
    "furthermore , it helps to determine / constrain the many unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the bchpt at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) .    in this work we report on the first systematic study of the g.s .",
    "octet baryon masses in the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) bchpt up to n@xmath3lo , taking into account the contributions of the virtual decuplet baryons .",
    "fvcs to the lattice data are calculated self - consistently . in order to fix all the @xmath4 lecs and",
    "test the consistency of the current lattice calculations , we perform a simultaneous fit to all the publicly available @xmath2 lqcd data from the pacs - cs  @xcite , lhpc  @xcite , hsc  @xcite , qcdsf - ukqcd  @xcite , and nplqcd  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the details of the studies can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the main results .",
    "up to n@xmath3lo , there are @xmath4 lecs to be determined . in order to ensure that the n@xmath3lo bchpt is suitable for the description of the lqcd data , we have chosen only the lqcd data satisfying @xmath5 gev@xmath6 and @xmath7 . by performing a @xmath8 fit to the lqcd data and the experimental octet baryon masses , we obtain the lecs and @xmath1 shown in table  [ tab : fitcoef ] .    considering only the octet baryon degrees of freedom",
    ", the eoms bchpt shows a good description of the lqcd data and experimental data with order - by - order improvement .",
    "the @xmath9 is about @xmath10 at n@xmath3lo , and it indicates that the lattice simulations from these five collaborations are consistent with each other  , although their setups are totally different . in addition , the values of the fitted lecs turn out to be in a natural range .",
    "because the octet - decuplet mass splitting , @xmath11 gev , is even smaller than the kaon - pion mass difference , one has to be careful about the virtual decuplet contributions in the bchpt .",
    "they are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corresponding best fit results are given in table  [ tab : fitcoef ] .",
    "the @xmath1 indicates that the explicit inclusion of the virtual decuplet baryons does not change the description of the lqcd data in any significant way , at least at @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of the lecs have changed a lot .",
    "this implies that using only the octet baryon mass data , one can not disentangle the virtual decuplet contributions from those of the virtual octet baryons and tree - level diagrams  @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that the explicit inclusion of the virtual decuplet baryons does seem to improve slightly the description of the fvcs , especially for the lqcd data with small @xmath13 .",
    "we have studied the lowest - lying octet baryon masses in the eoms bchpt up to n@xmath3lo , taking into account the contributions of the virtual decuplet baryons .",
    "the unknown low - energy constants are determined by a simultaneous fit to the latest @xmath2 lqcd simulations from the pacs - cs , lhpc , hsc , qcdsf - ukqcd , and nplqcd collaborations .",
    "finite - volume corrections are calculated self - consistently .",
    "our studies confirm that the covariant bchpt in the three flavour sector converges as expected , with clear improvement order by order .",
    "the results also indicate that the lqcd results are consistent with each other , though their setups are quite different .",
    "we show that in terms of chiral extrapolations , the contributions of the virtual decuplet baryons can not be easily disentangled from those of the virtual octet baryons and the tree - level contributions , at least at @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , a slightly better description of finite - volume corrections can be achieved once the virtual decuplet baryons are included .",
