    "protoplanetary disks are believed to have a complex structure . in the parts which are ionized enough ( _ active _ zones ) , the magnetic field couples to the gas and the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus  & hawley  1991 ) develops , leading to turbulence and angular momentum transport .",
    "some parts however are too cold and dense for the ionization to reach the level required for mhd turbulence to be sustained .",
    "however , in these so  called _ dead _ zones , there may still be some low level of transport due to reynolds or non turbulent maxwell stresses ( fleming & stone 2003 , turner & sano 2008 ) .",
    "finally , parts of the disk may be dense enough that gravitational instabilities develop , redistributing mass and angular momentum in such a way that the disk settles into a state of marginal stability .",
    "to date , there is no numerical simulations of such global disks .",
    "global three dimensional mhd simulations so far have modeled stratified and fully turbulent disks , but with no dead zones ( fromang  & nelson  2006 ) .",
    "it is of interest to study whether non  uniform disks composed of different regions as described above can be in steady  state or not .",
    "previous studies ( gammie 1999 , armitage et al .",
    "2001 ) assumed that no transport at all took place in the dead zone .",
    "therefore mass could only pile  up there until gravitational instabilities would develop .",
    "if the level of transport is non zero in the dead zone however , the disk may be able to adjust to reach a steady  state .",
    "it is this possibility that we investigate in this paper .    in determining the characteristics of the disk vertical strcuture",
    ", we ignore reprocessing of the stellar radiation .",
    "only heating associated with the different ( magnetic and hydrodynamic ) stresses is considered .",
    "reprocessing has been shown to be important when the disk surface is flared ( kenyon  & hartmann 1987 , chiang & goldreich 1997 , dalessio et al .",
    "1998 , dullemond et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it provides an extra heating source that dominates the disk beyond a few au and has important consequences on the structure of the dead zone ( matsumura & pudritz 2006 ) .",
    "however , in the models we present below , the parts of the disk beyond 1  au are shielded from the stellar radiation by the inner parts .",
    "these models , which do not include reprocessing , are therefore self  consistent .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : modeling ]",
    "we describe the way we model the transport in a disk with turbulent regions , dead zones and gravitationally unstable regions . in section  [ sec : vertical ] we present the equations governing the disk vertical structure and describe how they are solved . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of the calculations , and discuss them in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we find that steady ",
    "state solutions exist and correspond to disks which are thicker , hotter and more massive than disks without dead zones .",
    "protoplanetary disks are almost certainly magnetized , as they form from molecular clouds which are observed to contain a magnetic field . if the magnetic pressure is smaller than the thermal pressure , then the parts of the disk where the field couples to the gas are prone to the mri .",
    "its nonlinear developement is turbulence that transports angular momentum outward and therefore enables accretion ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 , brandenburg et al .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the mri in shearing  boxes have shown that the level of transport depends on the prandtl number ( ratio of the viscosity to the resistivity ; fromang et al .",
    "2007 , lesur  & longaretti  2007 ) .",
    "the simulations , which have not converged yet , also show that the turbulence is not sustained when the net magnetic flux is zero and for the range of parameters investigated ( relatively large prandtl numbers ) .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the magnetic field in protoplanetary disks does not vary very much on the scale of a few scale heights .",
    "for this reason , and if these disks were to be described locally by a shearing box , it would be more appropriate to assume a finite net flux . in the parts of the disk that are coupled to the field",
    ", we will therefore assume that turbulence is sustained and quantify the angular momentum transport using the parametrization of shakura  & sunyaev  ( 1973 ) , with @xmath2 being the ratio of the stress to the pressure ( the subscript t refers to turbulence ) .",
    "it has been shown that this prescription , which is formally valid only if the disk evolves under the action of a viscosity , can be used to describe the global properties and evolution of mhd turbulent disks , although details and stability issues can not be studied within this framework ( balbus  & papaloizou  1999 ) .",
    "given that @xmath2 as measured in the simulations depends on the prandtl number , and that prandtl numbers typical of protoplanetary disks are way too small to be investigated numerically , we will assign values to @xmath2 based on observations .",
    "the diffusion timescale is indeed limited by the disk lifetime , which is observed to be of a few @xmath3 years .",
    "this implies @xmath4@xmath5 ( at least in the outer parts of the disk which are fully turbulent ) .    in protoplanetary disks ,",
    "the minimum ionization fraction which is required for mhd turbulence to be initiated and sustained is on the order of @xmath6 on scales of 1  au ( e.g. , balbus  & hawley  2000 ) .",
    "although very small , this level of ionization is not reached in some parts of the disks , which are relatively cold and dense .",
    "the extent of the dead zone has been computed by several authors , taking into account ionization by cosmic rays ( gammie 1996 , sano et al .",
    "2000 who also included radioactivity ) and x  rays ( igea  & glassgold 1999 , fromang et al . 2002 , matsumura & pudritz 2003 who also included cosmic rays and radioactivity ) . in this paper",
    ", we will denote by @xmath7 the surface density of the active layer , i.e. the surface density beyond which ionizing photons can not penetrate .",
    "depending on the energy of these photons , @xmath7 may vary in the range 10100  g  @xmath8 ( gammie 1996 , fromang et al .",
    "note that the ionization in the disk inner parts is thermal , with the most abundant ions being na@xmath9 and k@xmath9 . for the ionization fraction to be larger than @xmath6 ,",
    "the temperature has to be higher than some value @xmath10 which is close to @xmath1  k over a large range of densities ( balbus & hawley 2000 ) .",
    "there is evidence from numerical simulations that some level of transport can be present in a dead zone that is sandwiched in between turbulent layers ( fleming  & stone  2003 ) , as the turbulence drives hydrodynamic waves that propagate in the dead zone and are associated with a reynolds stress .",
    "more recently , turner  & sano ( 2008 ) have also proposed that magnetic field be able to diffuse from the active layers into the dead zone . although the resistivity there is too high for mhd turbulence to be sustained , there is a large scale magnetic stress associated with the field that drives accretion . ( if dust grains are present in the disk however , the magnetic field may not able to diffuse down to the disk midplane at all radii . ) the transport and energy deposition in the dead zone due to these stresses are non local . however , for illustrative purposes , we will parameterize this transport with a shakura  & sunyaev parameter that we will denote @xmath11 ( where the subscript d refers to dead zone ) . fleming  & stone  ( 2003 ) found that the reynolds stress in the dead zone is about 10% of the mawell stress in the active layers .",
    "normalized by the thermal pressure , this translates into @xmath11 being between 0.07 and 0.3 times @xmath2 .",
    "however , in their simulations , the mass of the dead zone was only a few times that of the active layer .",
    "we might expect lower values of the reynolds stress deep into the dead zone when the mass of the active layer is significantly smaller than that of the active zone , which is the case in the models we present below .",
    "therefore , we will take @xmath11 in the range @xmath12  @xmath13 .    in the parts of the disk which are dense and cold ,",
    "gravitational instabilities develop .",
    "spiral density waves grow and transport angular momentum outward and mass inward .",
    "the level of saturation is determined by the fact that the disk settles into a state of marginal stability , with the toomre parameter @xmath14 being on the order of 1.5 ( laughlin  & bodenheimer  1994 , lodato  & rice  2004 ) .",
    "it was shown by balbus  & papaloizou  ( 1999 ) that in general , in a gravitationally unstable disk , the transport is non local and can not be described using the viscous disk theory .",
    "however , these authors pointed out that a local transport model might apply if the disk maintains itself in a state of marginal stability , which is the case considered here . in the regions where the disk is gravitationally unstable",
    ", we will therefore use the shakura  & sunyaev prescription and will adjust the transport parameter , that we will denote @xmath15 ( where the subscript g refers to gravity ) , such as to have @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that here the disk is modeled in a very schematic way .",
    "we believe this does not affect the gross features of the models we present below , although the details should be considered with caution .",
    "we consider a system of cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 based on the central star , with @xmath18 being the disk midplane .",
    "@xmath19 is the pressure , @xmath20 is the mass density per unit volume , @xmath21 is the temperature , @xmath22 is the angular velocity , @xmath23 is the enhanced kinematic viscosity associated with @xmath2 in turbulent layers , @xmath11 in dead zones and @xmath15 in gravitationally unstable regions , and @xmath24 is the opacity , which in general depends on both @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the thin  disk approximation is used throughout ( and checked to be valid _ a posteriori ) _ , so that @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the mass of the central star and @xmath27 the gravitational constant .",
    "the disk vertical structure is described by the equation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium :    @xmath28    together with the energy equation , which states that the rate of energy removal by radiation is locally balanced by the rate of energy production by viscous dissipation :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the radiative flux of energy through a surface of constant @xmath31 . to write the last term of this equation , we have used @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath34 in active layers , @xmath35 in dead zones and @xmath36 in the gravitationally unstable parts of the disk .",
    "therefore @xmath0 is a function of both @xmath31 and @xmath37 .",
    "the flux @xmath30 is given by :    @xmath38    with @xmath39 being the stefan  boltzmann constant . in principle ,",
    "equation  ( [ dtdz ] ) is valid only at radii where the disk is optically thick .",
    "however , when the disk is optically thin , i.e. when @xmath40 integrated over the disk thickness is small compared to unity , the temperature gradient given by equation  ( [ dtdz ] ) is small , so that the results we get are consistent in that case also . to close the system of equations , we adopt the equation of state of an ideal gas :",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath43 is the mass of the hydrogen molecule , which is the main component of protostellar disks at the temperatures and densities of interest here .",
    "we have to solve three first order ordinary differential equations for the three variables @xmath30 , @xmath19 ( or equivalently @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 as a function of @xmath31 at a given radius @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , we need three boundary conditions at each @xmath37 . these have been described in detail in papaloizou  & terquem  ( 1999 ) , so here we just recall briefly their expression .",
    "we denote with a subscript @xmath44 values at the disk surface .",
    "the flux at the surface is given by :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the disk surface mass density and @xmath48 being the vertically averaged viscosity .",
    "if the disk is in a steady state , @xmath49 does not vary with @xmath37 and is the constant accretion rate through the disk .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are the upper and lower boundaries of the disk , respectively .",
    "the surface pressure is given by :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the optical depth above the disk .",
    "since we have defined the disk surface such that the atmosphere above the disk is isothermal , we have to take @xmath54 .",
    "providing this is satisfied , the results do not depend on the value of @xmath53 we choose ( see papaloizou  & terquem  1999 ) . finally , the surface temperature satisfies the following equation :    @xmath55    here the disk is assumed immersed in a medium with background temperature @xmath56 , so that the surface temperature remains finite .      we look for steady  state solutions , so that @xmath49 does not depend on @xmath37 . at a given @xmath37",
    "we then solve equations  ( [ dpdz ] ) , ( [ dfdz ] ) and  ( [ dtdz ] ) with the boundary conditions  ( [ fs ] ) , ( [ ps ] ) and  ( [ ts ] ) to find the dependence of the state variables on @xmath31 .",
    "the ( rosseland ) opacity is taken from bell  & lin ( 1994 ) .",
    "this has contributions from dust grains , molecules , atoms and ions .",
    "it is written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 vary with temperature . to carry out the integration",
    ", we start from an estimated value of @xmath50 and iterate until the condition @xmath61 at @xmath18 is satisfied ( see details in papaloizou  & terquem  1999 ) .",
    "the integration starts at @xmath62 , where we have @xmath34 , assuming the disk is not gravitationally unstable , and proceeds all the way down to @xmath18 . at each value of @xmath31",
    ", we compute @xmath63 and compare it with @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath64 , and if @xmath65 , we fix @xmath35 .",
    "once the vertical integration is finished , we calculate the toomre parameter @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is now the total surface density and @xmath68 is evaluated at the midplane .",
    "when @xmath69 , we increase @xmath0 , that we now call @xmath15 , slightly , assume that it is now independent of @xmath31 , and redo the integration .",
    "we iterate the calculation , increasing @xmath15 at each step , until @xmath14 becomes larger than 1.5 .",
    "as the step with which we increase @xmath15 has a finite size , we usually end up with a value of @xmath14 between 1.5 and 2 after at most 20 iterations .    in the calculations presented here , we have taken @xmath70  m@xmath71 , @xmath72  k , the optical depth of the atmosphere above the disk surface @xmath73 and a background temperature @xmath74  k. in the optically thick regions of the disk , the value of @xmath50 is independent of the value of @xmath53 we choose .",
    "this is not the case in optically thin regions where we find that , as expected , the smaller @xmath75 the larger @xmath50 .",
    "however , this dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath53 has no physical significance , since the surface mass density , the optical thickness through the disk and the midplane temperature hardly vary with @xmath53 .",
    "this is because the mass is concentrated towards the disk midplane in a layer with thickness independent of @xmath76",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] , we plot @xmath77 versus @xmath37 ( from 0.05 to 100  au ) for @xmath78  m@xmath79  yr@xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 and 50  g  @xmath8 .",
    "the solid line delimits the surface of the disk whereas the dotted lines delimit the different regions in the disk . for @xmath83  g  @xmath8",
    ", there is a dead zone that extends from about 0.1  au to about 6  au .",
    "note that at small radii , this dead zone is present only at some intermediate values of @xmath31 , although the ionizing photons can not penetrate down to the disk midplane .",
    "this is because , if the disk starts turbulent there , the temperature near the midplane is large enough for the gas to be thermally ionized and therefore to remain turbulent . and",
    "if the disk does not start turbulent there , the temperature in the dead zone is large enough for thermal ionization to be above the citical level for the onset of the mri , so that any perturbation will lead to turbulence . from @xmath84  au up to about 27  au ,",
    "the disk is gravitationally unstable . in this region",
    ", @xmath15 increases with @xmath37 from @xmath85 up to @xmath5 .",
    "the disk is indeed cooler in the outer parts so that , if @xmath15 were kept constant , @xmath14 would decrease when @xmath37 increases .",
    "therefore , to maintain @xmath14 constant , @xmath15 has to increase with radius .",
    "the inner parts of the disk , where the temperature is larger than @xmath10 , and the surface and outer parts , where the ionizing photons can penetrate , are turbulent . for @xmath86",
    "g  @xmath8 , the dead zone extends from @xmath87  au to @xmath88  au and there is no gravitationally unstable region .",
    "this is because the dead zone is less extended and less massive than for smaller values of @xmath7 .",
    "as the ionizing photons can penetrate deeper than in the previous case , the turbulent zone is much more extended .    in this model ,",
    "there is a range of radii where the mass of the dead zone is much larger than that of the active layer .",
    "we denote @xmath89 and @xmath90 the column density of the active layer and dead zone , respectively . at @xmath91",
    "au , where the dead zone is vertically very extended , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath83 and 50  g  @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "whether hydrodynamic fluctuations driven by the turbulence in the active layers can penetrate down to the disk midplane in that case is not clear .    in order to get a model with higher values of @xmath94",
    ", we have investigated the case @xmath81 and @xmath95 ( @xmath78  m@xmath79  yr@xmath80 being the same as above ) .",
    "this is close to the values found by fleming & stone  ( 2003 ) in their simulations in which @xmath94 was varied between 0.187 and 0.75 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] is the same as figure  [ fig1 ] but with this larger value of @xmath11 .",
    "we note that the range of radii at which the disk is not fully turbulent is the same as before . here however , there is no gravitationally unstable region .",
    "the dead zone being less massive , it remains gravitationally stable . for @xmath83  g  @xmath8 ,",
    "the dead zone now extends from @xmath96  au up to about 27  au .",
    "the vertical extent of the dead zone is smaller than in the case @xmath82 . at @xmath97",
    "au , where the dead zone is the more extended , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath83 and 50  g  @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "this latter value is closer to those investigated by fleming & stone  ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that if we were to assume that the reynolds stress in the midplane were 10% of the maxwell stress at the boundary of the dead / active zone , as found by fleming  & stone  ( 2003 ) , we would get @xmath100 after normalizing the stress by the thermal pressure at these locations .",
    "but of course the angular momentum flux is spread throughout the different zones and in principle @xmath0 should vary with @xmath31 .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot @xmath77 , @xmath67 and the midplane temperature @xmath101 versus @xmath37 for the same parameters as in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the curves corresponding to standard disk models ( with no dead zone and no adjustment in the gravitationally unstable parts ) with constant @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "as expected , in the parts where there is a dead zone , the disk is thicker , more massive and hotter .",
    "this is because the vertically averaged value of @xmath0 decreases as the vertical extent of the dead zone increases , and @xmath77 , @xmath67 and @xmath101 increase as @xmath0 decreases ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "we see that for low values of @xmath7 , i.e. when the ionizing photons do not penetrate deep into the disk , the turbulent layer is thin and the properties of the disk at the radii where there is a dead zone are very close to that of a standard disk with constant @xmath35 .",
    "for all the values of @xmath7 , @xmath77 has a maximum at a fraction of or around 1  au , which produces a puffing up of the disk .",
    "this is because the mass density is very high there , so the dead zone is vertically extended , which makes the disk hotter .",
    "note that a maximum is also present in the standard disk models with constant @xmath0 .",
    "the profiles of @xmath77 , @xmath67 and @xmath101 tend to be a bit steeper than in standard disk models with no dead zone , as they are bracketed by the profiles corresponding to constant @xmath34 and @xmath35 models .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we plot @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a function of @xmath102 at @xmath91  au for @xmath82 and at @xmath97  au for @xmath95 for the same parameters as in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "when the dead zone extends down to the disk midplane , the disk structure is very close to that of a standard disk with constant @xmath35 for the lowest value of @xmath7 . for the largest values of @xmath7 ,",
    "the dead zone is small and the disk is similar to a standard disk with constant @xmath34 . for @xmath82 , we actually can not distinguish between the two models for @xmath103  g  @xmath8 . we see that the mass density in the dead zone is typically 10 times larger than that of a standard fully turbulent disk with constant @xmath34 .    in figure",

    "we checked that decreasing @xmath2 and @xmath11 by a factor of ten has almost exactly the same effect as increasing @xmath49 by the same factor , all the other parameters being kept fixed . when @xmath2 and @xmath11 are smaller or @xmath49 is larger , the disk is more massive and therefore gravitational instabilities develop in a more extended region , up to the disk outer boundary .",
    "to keep @xmath14 constant @xmath106 there , @xmath15 has to reach @xmath107 in the disk outer parts , i.e. to become larger than @xmath2 .",
    "we have also run models with @xmath81 and @xmath108 .",
    "we get similar results in that case , with the locations where there is a dead zone being hotter , thicker and more massive .",
    "we note that in all the models presented above , the puffing up of the inner parts of the disk casts a shadow over the outer parts , which therefore do not reprocess stellar radiation .",
    "the models presented here are self  consistent in a sense that if the disk is not illuminated by the star to begin with , it will not be able to reprocess the stellar radiation at any time .",
    "there may however exist another type of solutions in which stellar irradiation is important .",
    "indeed , if the outer parts of the disk are illuminated at some point ( before a steady  state is reached for instance ) , a flaring is produced that could be maintained . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have modified the surface temperature . instead of using equation  ( [ ts ] ) to calculate @xmath109 , we fix",
    "@xmath110  k. this corresponds to @xmath111  k , 300  k and @xmath112  k at @xmath113 , 1 and 10  au , respectively .",
    "these values are close to the surface temperatures computed by dalessio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in irradiated disk models for @xmath78  m@xmath79  yr@xmath80 and @xmath114 , this value of @xmath0 being intermediate between @xmath2 and @xmath11 . with this new @xmath109",
    ", the profile of @xmath77 we get still shows a shadowing of the outer parts .",
    "this suggests that even if the disk outer parts are illuminated by the central star at some point , before a steady  state is reached , they can not flare enough to remain irradiated after a steady  state is established , so that reprocessing of stellar radiation does not play a role in the steady  state models .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a disk in which transport is produced by either : i ) maxwell stress resulting from mhd turbulence in the ( gravitationally stable ) regions where the gas couples well to the magnetic field ; ii ) gravitational stress in the parts which are gravitationally unstable ; iii ) reynolds stress associated with hydromagnetic waves driven by the turbulence in adjacent layers and maxwell stress associated with large scale field siphoned off from these turbulent layers in the parts which are not turbulent and are gravitationally stable ( dead zones ) .",
    "we have modeled the transport using the shakura & sunyaev prescription , with @xmath11 being 10 to @xmath115 times smaller than @xmath2 , and @xmath15 being adjusted such as to give a toomre parameter @xmath16 in the gravitationally unstable regions .",
    "although such a modeling is in principle not valid when the transport is non  local , we believe it does not invalidate the gross features of the models we have presented .",
    "we have found that steady  state models of such a disk exist , and that they are physically reasonable . since @xmath116 , mass flow through the disk can be uniform only if the disk is more massive , hotter and thicker at the radii where the vertically  averaged value of @xmath0 is smaller , i.e. where there is a dead zone .",
    "note that even though the disk is thicker at the locations where there is a dead zone , it remains thin for the parameters investigated here . in disks in which the dead zone tends to be massive , which is the case for the lowest values of @xmath11 and/or the lowest values of @xmath7 investigated here , gravitational instabilities control the dynamics of part of the disk .    whether these models are realistic or not depends on whether hydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all the way inside the dead zone .",
    "this may be more easily achieved when the ratio of the mass of the dead zone to that of the active layer is the smallest , which in our models corresponds to @xmath117 .",
    "if the disk is at some stage of its evolution out of steady  state , then the surface density will change in such a way as for the disk to evolve toward steady  state . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a disk in which @xmath49 decreases inward at some location .",
    "then mass will accumulate there as accretion through this region is slower , until @xmath67 is large enough for the flow to be steady .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath49 increases inward at some location , accretion there will be faster and mass will be depleted until @xmath67 is reduced to the level where a steady  state is reached .",
    "the timescale @xmath118 for establishing steady  state at the radii where there is a dead zone may be long though , as it is given by :      where @xmath120 . with @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", we get @xmath123 and @xmath124  years at 1 and 5  au , respectively , which is much smaller than the disk lifetime . however , if the dead zone at these radii is vertically very extended , we have @xmath125 , so that the viscous timescale can get 100 times longer if @xmath82 .",
    "at 1  au we still get a timescale significantly smaller than the disk lifetime , but this is not the case at 5  au , where the disk may not be able to reach steady  state . if these parts of the disk build  up from mass inflowing from further out , then the mass in the dead zone will slowly increase .",
    "this process will never produce outbursts as envisioned by gammie  ( 1999 ) though .",
    "indeed , before enough mass could pile  up for an outburst to be produced , a steady  state would be achieved in which mass would be transported either by density waves or reynolds stress driven by the turbulent layers .",
    "note that the spectral energy distribution of a steady disk such as those considered in this paper is not different from that of a standard disk with no dead zone , as the total flux emitted at the surface depends only on @xmath49 .",
    "the surface temperature also does not depend on @xmath7 , as can be seen from equation  ( [ ts ] ) .",
    "however , the temperature just below the surface is significantly larger in disks with dead zones than in standard disks .",

    ", irradiation of the disk by the central star would have to be taken into account . although it will not be important beyond the regions where there is a dead zone , as these parts are shielded from the stellar radiation due to the puffing up of the disk",
    ", it will be important in the parts where @xmath77 increases .",
    "finally , we comment that a steady  state disk with a dead zone is a more favorable environment for planet formation than a standard disk , as the dead zone , which in general encompasses the region of planet formation , is significantly more massive .",
    "planet formation would therefore be faster there ( lissauer 1993 ) .",
    "note however that there is an issue as how to stop type  i migration of the cores in these dead zones .",
    "turbulence , which has been shown to alter this type of migration ( nelson & papaloizou 2004 ) , can not be invoked .",
    "but if large scale fields are siphoned off in these regions from the turbulent layers , they may prevent the cores from migrating too fast ( terquem 2003 , fromang et al .",
    "2005 , muto et al .",
    "planetary cores may also be stopped at the interface between the dead zone and the inner turbulent region , where the surface mass density varies sharply , as suggested by masset et al .",
    "this process however relies on the ( positive ) corotation torque becoming dominant over the lindblad torque due to the density gradient and was studied in the context of a laminar viscous disk .",
    "it is not clear how the corotation torque is affected by the turbulence at the transition between the active and dead zones , and whether it would still be as efficient in this context .",

    "<S> we study an accretion disk in which three different regions may coexist : mhd turbulent regions , dead zones and gravitationally unstable regions . </S>",
    "<S> although the dead zones are stable , there is some transport due to the reynolds stress associated with waves emitted from the turbulent layers . </S>",
    "<S> we model the transport in each of the different regions by its own @xmath0 parameter , this being 10 to @xmath1 times smaller in dead zones than in active layers . in gravitationally unstable regions , @xmath0 is determined by the fact that the disk self  adjusts to a state of marginal stability . </S>",
    "<S> we construct steady  state models of such disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for uniform mass flow , the disk has to be more massive , hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone . in disks in which the dead zone is very massive , gravitational instabilities </S>",
    "<S> are present . whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether hydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all the way inside the dead zone </S>",
    "<S> . this may be more easily achieved when the ratio of the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large , which in our models corresponds to @xmath0 in the dead zone being about 10% of @xmath0 in the active layers . </S>",
    "<S> if the disk is at some stage of its evolution not in steady  state , then the surface density will evolve toward the steady  state solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath0 in the dead zone is much smaller than in the active zone , the timescale for the parts of the disk beyond a few au to reach steady  state may become longer than the disk lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> steady  state disks with dead zones are a more favorable environment for planet formation than standard disks , since the dead zone is typically 10 times more massive than a corresponding turbulent zone at the same location . </S>"
