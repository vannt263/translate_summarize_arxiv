    "the mechanism and astronomical sites of frb emission remain mysterious , even after the discovery of the repeating frb 121102 and its identification with a dwarf galaxy at redshift @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the requirement that energies of as much as @xmath4 ergs , assuming isotropic emission ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) be radiated in @xmath5 ms points to sources in regions of high power and high energy density @xcite .",
    "the natural candidates are neutron stars , and possible energy sources are magnetostatic , as in soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) , or rotational , as in radio pulsars .",
    "sgr have low duty factors and short rise times analogous to those of frb , but their candidacy suffers from the fact that the radiation of sgr is almost entirely thermal soft gamma rays . although at least one sgr has been observed as a radio source @xcite , its emission lasted for weeks , resembled that of an expanding cloud rather than a fast transient , and offers no explanation of the frb phenomenon .",
    "the environment of sgr has an intense flux of thermal radiation ( up to @xmath6 erg/@xmath7/s at the neutron star , corresponding to a black body temperature of @xmath8k or 300 kev ) which is inhospitable to coherent ( or any nonthermal ) radio radiation because of rapid comptonization of energetic electrons .",
    "in addition , one frb was fortuitously the subject of radio observation @xcite during its giant outburst , but no frb was observed . as a galactic object ,",
    "had it been the source of a frb an extraordinarily strong signal , even in the far sidelobes of a radio telescope , would have been expected ( for possible loopholes see * ? ? ?",
    "giant pulses from radio pulsars may be more plausible explanations of frb .",
    "the fact that nanoshots from two galactic radio pulsars @xcite had brightness temperatures exceeding even those of frb points in this direction .",
    "no detailed mechanism has been proposed , but after nearly 50 years in which theorists have failed to present a convincing detailed mechanism of even `` ordinary '' coherent radio pulsar emission , this should not be a fatal objection .",
    "even the basic electrodynamics of pulsar magnetospheres remains controversial @xcite .",
    "pulsar magnetospheres contain `` gaps '' in which @xmath9 @xcite . in these gaps",
    "intense electric fields accelerate electrons and positrons .",
    "their curvature radiation consists of gamma - rays of sufficiently high energy to produce further electron - positron pairs by a single - photon process in the strong neutron star magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out an analogy between the breakdown of a resistive atmosphere in a lightning stroke and the breakdown of the resistive vacuum in a gap in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this is only an analogy .",
    "the fundamental physical processes are different and the parameter regimes differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "estimates are necessarily qualitative , or , at best , order - of - magnitude . even were it possible to construct a more quantitative theory , the range of plausible pulsar parameters is several orders of magnitude in both spin frequency and magnetic field .",
    "it includes such hypothetical objects as neutron stars with both surface fields of @xmath10 gauss and millisecond periods .",
    "the constraint of a lifetime @xmath11y inferred from the repeating frb 121102 need not apply to non - repeating frb that might spin down much faster .",
    "@xcite have suggested `` lightning '' triggered by external @xmath12-rays as a source of rrat emission .",
    "an important difference between their work and this paper is the suggestion here that `` lightning '' is powered by stored electrostatic energy , and thus may involve and radiate a power greater , perhaps by orders of magnitude , than the spindown power .",
    "this is likely necessary to explain frb , but not to explain rrat .",
    "although there is a fairly detailed semiquantitative understanding of terrestrial cloud charging and lightning , it is unlikely that we would have predicted their existence had we not known of it . this should remind us that pulsar magnetospheres may also behave in unexpected ways .",
    "unable to predict their phenomenology , our understanding may be limited to delineating the range of possibilities permitted by physical laws .",
    "lightning has been the subject of scientific study since the work of ben franklin nearly 300 years ago .",
    "the historic and modern literatures are reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cumulonimbus clouds ( thunderheads ) are charged by differential motion among oppositely charged water droplets , graupel ( partially frozen hail ) and ice .",
    "potential drops are @xmath13v over 510 km and discharges carry @xmath14 coulombs , releasing @xmath15j of electrostatic energy .",
    "this is @xmath16 of the total electrostatic energy of the cloud , a capacitor of dimension @xmath17 km in each of three dimensions ( capacitance @xmath18f ) .",
    "not only does the air break down along the visible channel of the lightning stroke ( bolt ) , but there must be sufficient conductivity outside the channel itself to collect a substantial fraction of the charge distributed throughout the cloud .",
    "much less is known about pulsar magnetospheres . unlike thunderclouds",
    ", they can not be imaged or probed ; we only observe their radiation that is directed toward us and its variation as the neutron star rotates .",
    "both their structure and the mechanisms of production of pulsar radiation remain controversial , nearly 50 years after their discovery @xcite .    it is generally assumed that the magnetic fields of pulsar magnetospheres are determined by currents within the dense matter of the neutron star that change only on a very long ( @xmath19y ) resistive time scale .",
    "this is in contrast to sgr , that are believed to result from the sudden release of magnetostatic energy in a reorganization of the magnetic field @xcite resulting from reconnection of magnetospheric currents .",
    "these currents may be relics of the formation of the neutron star that dissipate in @xmath20y , the empirical lifetimes of sgr @xcite .",
    "if there are two or more possible states , with different charge distributions and electrostatic energies , of a pulsar magnetosphere , with the more energetic state metastable , then there may be sudden transitions between them with the release of their energy difference .",
    "this would be analogous to the transition of a thundercloud from a more to a less energetic charge distribution as charge flows in a lightning bolt .",
    "pulsar magnetospheres are highly relativistic .",
    "the characteristic plasma density of a co - rotating magnetosphere with angular velocity @xmath21 @xcite is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio of its magnetic energy density to its characteristic rest mass energy density @xmath25 this is very large for all pulsars , even low field millisecond pulsars .",
    "because magnetospheres are relativistic , the release of energy in a transition between two states occurs in a time @xmath26s , where @xmath27 is the neutron star s radius , consistent with empirical upper bounds to frb widths at their sources ( before propagation broadening ) .",
    "there is no generally accepted solution for pulsar magnetospheres ( much less two solutions , one of which is more energetic but metastable ) so we only make order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the fundamental equation of a co - rotating force - free magnetosphere is @xmath28 where the co - rotation frequency @xmath21 need not be the same as the neutron star s rotation frequency @xmath29 . @xcite",
    "present an explicit solution for an aligned rotator with @xmath30 . within a connected corotating region @xmath31 ; @xmath32 .",
    "distinct corotating regions with differing @xmath33 are separated by gaps in which @xmath34 .    from eq .",
    "[ ecorot ] the electrostatic energy may be estimated @xmath35 and the energy released in a transition between an initial @xmath36 and a final @xmath37 @xmath38 where the fractional change in @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is unknown , as is the efficiency @xmath42 of conversion of this energy into coherent frb emission .",
    "both may be @xmath43 , but if both @xmath29 and @xmath44 are large there may still be sufficient energy to power frb .      alternatively , treat the magnetosphere as a capacitor with capacitance @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the width of its gap , charged to the characteristic voltage in a polar cap model @xcite @xmath47",
    ". the resulting energy would be @xmath48 the value of @xmath46 is unknown , though it can not exceed @xmath27 . for sufficiently strongly magnetized and rapidly rotating neutron stars",
    "the electrostatic energy may be more than sufficient to power frb , the most energetic of which radiated , assuming isotropic emission , @xmath4 ergs , even if the efficiency @xmath49 .",
    "the required values of @xmath44 and @xmath29 are found in known pulsars , but not in combination . that is attributed to their ages ( eq .  [ tau ] , below )",
    ". a pulsar - frb might be as young as the time required for a supernova remnant to dissipate to transparency , and therefore could have both large @xmath44 and large @xmath29 .",
    "neutron star formation by collapse without expulsion of a remnant or a visible supernova may also be possible ( codes have had more difficulty producing a supernova than neutron star formation without one ) .",
    "if so , the only lower bound on the duration of frb activity would be the observed activity of a repeating frb , permitting simultaneously large @xmath44 and large @xmath29",
    ". the duration could be even shorter , and @xmath44 and @xmath29 even larger , for non - repeating frb , for which no lower bound on their duration of activity can be established .      in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "very large electric fields are not sustainable .",
    "for example , eq .  [ capacitor ] assumes an electric field ( in cgs units , statvolts / cm ) @xmath50 if @xmath51 this exceeds the sauter - heisenberg - euler - schwinger @xcite vacuum pair breakdown field ( in statvolts / cm ) @xmath52    pair production cascades driven by curvature radiation may break down the insulating vacuum at lower ( but still very high ) fields @xcite . `` schwinger sparks '' , produced by fields exceeding the limit of eq .",
    "[ schwinger ] , have been proposed @xcite as the source of pulsar nanoshots .",
    "the frb model proposed here does not require that limit to be exceeded .",
    "if the available electrostatic energy in a capacitor model is limited by the energy density @xmath53 , then @xmath54 this is less than the limit of eq .",
    "[ capacitor ] for rapidly spinning or strongly magnetized neutron stars , particularly if @xmath46 is small .",
    "it is still sufficient to power the observed frb provided @xmath55 cm ( similar to gap widths estimated by @xcite ) , the electrostatic energy difference between initial and final configurations is comparable to that given by eq .",
    "[ she s ] , and emission is efficient and roughly isotropic . collimated emission @xcite would mitigate the energy requirement .",
    "the efficiency is , of course , unknown .",
    "there can be no pair production unless @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath56 in one frame , the lorentz invariance of @xmath57 implies that @xmath34 in all frames . in gaps , where there is a parallel component of @xmath58 , breakdown can occur and @xmath59 has a limit like eq .",
    "[ schwinger ] @xcite .",
    "if there be a magnetic field with @xmath60 and @xmath31 , as expected in a neutron star magnetosphere outside of `` gaps '' , the lorentz invariance of @xmath61 and of @xmath62 implies the existence of a frame in which @xmath63 , and there can be no pair production .",
    "pair production can not set an upper bound on @xmath59 , other than @xmath44 , in corotating regions in which @xmath31 .",
    "the limit of eq .",
    "[ she s ] is not applicable to the electrostatic energy stored , and released , in regions where @xmath31 .",
    "energies as great as those of eq .",
    "[ deltae ] may be available to power frb .",
    "frb might be produced by conversion of longitudinal electrostatic plasma waves , propagating along the magnetic field ( with the same dispersion relation as in a nonmagnetic plasma ) , to transverse electromagnetic waves .",
    "the plasma frequency corresponding to the characteristic plasma density eq .",
    "[ gj ] , allowing for the possibility that the electrons have relativistic speeds , reducing their acceleration by electric fields parallel to their velocities ( that are parallel to @xmath64 ) by a factor @xmath65 , is @xmath66 where @xmath12 is a mean lorentz factor of electron or positron motion along the magnetic field , assumed to be the direction of propagation of the longitudinal plasma wave .",
    "the spin - down time of a rotating magnetic neutron star , taking the magnetic moment as perpendicular to its angular momentum , is @xmath67 where @xmath68g-@xmath7 is its moment of inertia .",
    "the product @xmath69 appears as in eq .",
    "[ plasma ] for the plasma frequency , so that @xmath70 can be expressed as a function of @xmath71 : @xmath72    if the plasma frequency is that of nonrelativistic electrons , then the spin - down time is comparable to that of a typical observed galactic pulsar .",
    "such pulsars are numerous , with @xmath73 in the galaxy , while frb are extremely rare , with a detected event rate @xmath74/galaxy - y , arguing against the hypothesis that frb are produced by pulsars resembling observed galactic pulsars .",
    "if the plasma is relativistic , the sensitivity of @xmath70 to @xmath12 is so extreme that no quantitative conclusion can be drawn from eq .",
    "[ spindown ] .",
    "eq .  [ tau ] can be compared to the observed lower bound on the lifetime of the repeating frb 121102 to infer @xmath75 . comparing to eq .",
    "[ deltae ] then leads to an upper bound on the available energy @xmath76 ergs , consistent with the observed energy of its frb of @xmath77 ergs .",
    "equivalently , the spin - down time of a pulsar emitting frb of energy @xmath78 with efficiency @xmath42 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 ergs .",
    "unfortunately , we can not estimate @xmath41 or @xmath42 , and if frb emission is collimated @xcite @xmath78 may be much less than that inferred with the assumption of isotropic emission .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to make quantitative predictions from eq .",
    "this paper proposes that frb are `` electrars '' powered by electrostatic energy , in analogy to sgr that are powered by magnetostatic energy ( `` magnetars '' ) . in each case energy",
    "is released by a transition between two configurations , the more energetic of which is metastable .",
    "neither of these phenomena were predicted before their discovery ; nature is cleverer than scientists at finding ways to tap stored energy .",
    "the energetic requirements may be met in the magnetospheres of fast high - field pulsars .",
    "none of these are known , but their spin - down lifetimes would be very short , conceivably as short as minutes , and most may be hidden within opaque young supernova remnants . this is consistent with the extreme rarity of frb .",
    "a weakness of the hypothesis suggested here is that there is no theory that demonstrates the existence of two ( or more ) magnetospheric configurations with distinct energies , nor that such an energy difference can be released suddenly . without an understanding of the magnetospheric structure of pulsars that may not be a fatal flaw , but it is a serious one .",
    "there is , however , a precedent from sgr : although any magnetosphere has a lower energy state in which there is no magnetic field , _ a priori _ the only path to it is by very slow resistive dissipation that does not make outbursts . the fact that sudden magnetic reconnection can and does occur is empirical and not based on fundamental understanding .",
    "perhaps electrostatic energy too may be released in a burst , as it is in a thundercloud .",
    "combination of eq .",
    "[ deltae ] with eq .",
    "[ tau ] implies that the more energetic frb are likely to have lifetimes much shorter than the lower bound of 3 years observed for the repeating frb 121102 .",
    "this conclusion can not be quantified without some knowledge of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but it is qualitatively consistent with the absence of repetitions of more energetic frb .",
    "the bursts of frb 121102 had particularly low energy ; the mean fluence of 17 bursts @xcite was 0.275 jy - ms . assuming isotropic emission at @xmath81 , the mean energy radiated , integrated over the 12141537 mhz band of observation , was @xmath82ergs , less than the inferred energies of @xmath83ergs of other frb .",
    "the efficiency @xmath42 of coherent radio emission of pulsars is low .",
    "however , when the bunching of charges is extreme , as it must be to explain frb , radiation is rapid .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate energy loss times @xmath84s .",
    "then , in order for the emission to be at ghz frequencies ( rather than @xmath10/s ) radiative losses must be very closely balanced by the accelerating electric field on the energy loss time scale .",
    "this explains the efficient radiation as a self - consistent property of extreme charge bunching .",
    "if more energetic frb are produced by pulsars with particularly short spin - down times , searches for repetitions must be conducted immediately after their first occurrence .",
    "the observability of frb may depend on the rapid dissipation of a supernova remnant , a patchy remnant , or neutron star formation without a supernova at all .",
    "these requirements may help explain the fact that the frb rate , despite the possibility of repetitions , is less than @xmath85 of the supernova rate .",
    "the broad range ( approximately -10 to + 14 ) of spectral indices observed @xcite in bursts from the repeating frb 121102 might appear to indicate comparatively narrow - band emission with power peaking at frequencies sometimes above , sometimes below , and sometimes in the middle of the band of observation .",
    "however , the rapid variation of burst widths indicates that scintillation is strong .",
    "@xcite report widths of @xmath86ms and @xmath87ms for two bursts ( their bursts 8 and 11 ) 413 s apart .",
    "a factor of two variation in broadening suggests @xmath88 variation in fluence and frequencies of spectral peaks and minima , indicating that the variation in fitted spectral indices is the result of scintillation , not an intrinsic property of the source .",
