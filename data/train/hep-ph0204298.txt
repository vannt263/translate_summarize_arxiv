    "in the kinematical region of small proton momentum fraction @xmath0 , the gluon is the main parton driving the behavior of the deep inelastic quantities . the standard qcd evolution @xcite furnishes a powerlike growth for the gluon distribution .",
    "this result leads , at first glance , to the unitarity violation at asymptotic energies , requiring a sort of control . in the partonic language , at the infinite momentum frame , the small @xmath0 region corresponds to the high parton density .",
    "the latter is connected with the black disk limit of the proton target and with the parton recombination phenomenon .",
    "these issues can be addressed through a non - linear dynamics beyond the usual dglap formalism .",
    "the complete knowledge about the non - linear dynamical regime plays an important role in the theoretical description of the reactions in the forthcoming experiments rhic and lhc , where these effects will be enhanced by the high energies or by the nuclear probes .",
    "the description of dis in the color dipole picture is somewhat intuitive , providing with a simple representation in contrast to the involved one from the breit ( infinite momentum ) frame .",
    "considering small values of the bjorken variable @xmath0 , the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath1 pair ( dipole ) with fixed transverse separation @xmath2 at large distances upstream of the target , and interacts in a short time with the proton .",
    "more complicated configurations should be considered for larger transverse size systems , for instance the photon fock state @xmath3 . an immediate consequence from the lifetime of the pair ( @xmath4 ) to be bigger than the interaction one is the factorization between the photon wavefunction and the cross section dipole - proton in the @xmath5 total cross section .",
    "the wavefunctions are perturbatively calculable , namely through qed for the @xmath1 configuration @xcite and from qcd for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the effective dipole cross section should be modeled and it includes perturbative and non - perturbative content",
    ". however , since the interaction strength relies only on the configuration of the interacting system the dipole cross section turns out to be universal and may be employed in a wide variety of small @xmath0 processes .",
    "we have taken into account a sound formalism providing the unitarity corrections to the dis at small @xmath0 , namely the glauber - mueller approach in qcd .",
    "it was introduced by a. mueller @xcite , who developed the glauber formalism to study saturation effects in the quark and gluon distributions in the nucleus considering the heavy onium scattering .",
    "later developments obtained an evolution equation taking into account the unitarity corrections ( perturbative shadowing ) , generating a non - linear dynamics which is connected with higher twist contributions .",
    "its main characteristic is to provide a theoretical framework for the saturation effects , relying on the multiscattering of the pqcd pomeron . in this contribution",
    "we report our studies considering the parton saturation formalism to describe the observables driven by the gluonic content of the proton in the color dipole picture @xcite .",
    "the inclusive structure function @xmath7 is calculated , disregarding the approximations commonly considered in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "the structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are also presented using the glauber - mueller approach and the rest frame in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the rest frame physical picture is advantageous since the lifetime of the photon fluctuation and the interaction process are well defined @xcite .",
    "the more simple case is the quark - antiquark state ( color dipole ) , which is the leading configuration for small transverse size systems .",
    "the well known coherence length is expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the bjorken variable and @xmath11 the proton mass .",
    "an important consequence of this formulation is that the photoabsortion cross section can be derived from the expectation value of the interaction cross section for the multiparticle fock states of the virtual photon weighted by the light - cone wave functions of these states @xcite .",
    "that cross section can be cast in the quantum mechanical factorized form , @xmath12    the formulation above is valid even beyond perturbation theory , since it is determined from the space - time structure of the process .",
    "the @xmath13 are the photon wavefunctions ( for transverse @xmath14 , and longitudinal @xmath15 , polarizations ) describing the pair configuration : @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fractions of the photon s light - cone momentum carried by the quark and antiquark of the pair , respectively .",

    "the quantity @xmath24 is interpreted as the cross section of the scattering of the effective dipole with fixed tranverse separation @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the dipole cross section is its universal character , namely it depends only on the transverse separation @xmath25 of the color dipole .",
    "the dependence on the external probe particle , i.e. , the photon virtuality , relies in the wavefunctions . in general , an anstz for the effective dipole cross section is obtained and the process is analized in the impact parameter space .",
    "the main feature of the current models in the literature is to interpolate the physical regions of small transverse separations ( perturbative qcd picture ) and the large ones ( regge - soft picture ) .",
    "here we have used the glauber - mueller approach to determine the dipole cross section , with the advantage of providing the corrections required by unitarity in an eikonal expansion . for the large @xmath2 region ,",
    "we choose to follow a similar procedure from the saturation model ( gbw ) @xcite , namely saturating the dipole cross section ( @xmath2-independent constant value ) .",

    "it should be determined by a detailed model for the interaction .",
    "the opacity function has a simple physical interpretation , namely @xmath34 corresponds to the probability that no inelastic scatterings with the target occur . to provide the connection with the glauber formalism",
    ", the opacity function can be written in the factorized form @xmath35 , considering @xmath36 normalized as @xmath37 ( for a detailed discussion , see i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "we identify the opacity @xmath38 .",
    "the ( @xmath1 pair ) dipole - proton cross section is well known @xcite and in double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) has the following form @xmath39 with the @xmath2-dependent scale @xmath40 .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ dipdla ] ) one can connect directly the dipole picture with the usual parton distributions ( gluon ) , since they are solutions of the dglap equations . in our case",
    ", we follow the calculations of ref . @xcite and consider the effective scale @xmath41 . from the above expression",
    ", we obtain a dipole cross section satisfying the unitarity constraint and a framework to study the unitarity effects ( saturation ) in the gluon dglap distribution function .",
    "hence , hereafter we use the glauber - mueller dipole cross section given by @xmath42    in order to perform numerical estimates one needs to define the profile function @xmath43 .",
    "this function contains information about the angular distribution in the scattering .",
    "we have chosen a simple gaussian shape in the impact parameter space , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the atomic number and @xmath46 is the target radius .",
    "we will keep this notation although we are only concerned with the nucleon case .",
    "the @xmath47 value should be determined from the data , ranging between @xmath48 gev@xmath49 for the proton case @xcite . here , we have used the value ( @xmath50 gev@xmath49 ) obtained from a good description of both inclusive structure function and its derivative @xcite .",
    "such a value corresponds to significative unitarity corrections to the standard dglap input even in the current hera kinematics .    in the calculations",
    "we have used the grv94 parametrization @xcite : bearing in mind that @xmath51 , its evolution initial scale @xmath52 gev@xmath53 allows to scan dipole sizes up to @xmath54 gev@xmath55 (= 0.62 fm ) . for recent parametrizations , where @xmath56 gev@xmath53 ( @xmath57 fm ) , the uncertainty due to nonperturbative content in the calculations would increase .",
    "an additional advantage is that grv94 does not include non - linear effects to the dglap evolution since it was obtained from rather large @xmath0 values , i.e. this ensures that grv94 does not include unitarity corrections in the initial scale . to proceed , for the large @xmath2 region",
    ", we choose the following ansatz : the gluon distribution is frozen at scale @xmath58 , namely @xmath59 .",
    "then , for the large distance contribution @xmath60 the gluon distribution reads as @xmath61 leading to the correct behavior @xmath62 as @xmath63 and providing the simplest technical procedure .",
    "first , we perform estimates for the structure function @xmath7 at the rest frame considering the glauber - mueller dipole cross section @xcite . the expression , with the explicit integration limits on photon momentum fraction @xmath16 and transverse separation @xmath2 is , @xmath64    in the fig . ( [ figf2 ] )",
    "one shows @xmath7 for representative virtualities @xmath65 from the latest h1 collaboration measurements @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse contributions are shown separately .",
    "an effective light quark mass ( @xmath66 quarks ) was taken , with the value @xmath67 mev , and the target radius is considered @xmath50 gev@xmath49 .",
    "it should be stressed that this value leads to larger saturation corrections rather than using radius ranging over @xmath68 gev@xmath49 .",
    "the soft contribution comes from the freezing of the gluon distribution at large transverse separation as discussed at the previous section .    from the plots we verify a good agreement in the normalization ,",
    "however the slope seems quite steep .",
    "this fact is due to the modelling for the soft contribution and it suggests that a more suitable nonperturbative input should be taken . to clarify the role played by the soft nonperturbative contribution to @xmath7 , in the fig .",
    "( [ f2comp ] ) we plot separately the perturbative contribution and parametrize the soft contribution introducing the nonperturbative structure function @xmath69 @xcite , which is added to the perturbative one .",
    "the soft piece normalization is @xmath70 .",
    "accordingly , we have used just shadowing corrections for the quark sector , taking into account only the transverse photon wavefunction and zero quark mass . the integration on the transverse separation is taken over @xmath71 , with @xmath52 gev@xmath53 for leading order grv94 gluon distribution .",
    "this leads to a residual contribution to the soft piece which would come from the transverse separations @xmath72 .",
    "it is again verified that the soft contribution is important at small virtualities and decreasing as it gets larger .",
    "the data description is quite successful .",
    "concluding , we have a theoretical estimate , i.e. no fitting procedure , of the inclusive structure function @xmath73 through the glauber - mueller approach for the dipole cross section , detecting a non negligible importance of a suitable input for the large dipole size region .      from qcd theory ,",
    "the structure function @xmath8 has a non - zero value due to the gluon radiation , as is encoded in the altarelli - martinelli equation ( see @xcite ) , considering the breit frame .",
    "experimentally , the determination of the @xmath8 is quite limited , providing few data points .",
    "most recently , the h1 collaboration has determined the longitudinal structure function through the reduced double differential cross section , where the data points were obtained consistently with the previous measurements , however being more precise and lying into a broader kinematical range @xcite .    in fig .",
    "( [ flrframe ] ) we present the estimates for the @xmath8 structure function , in representative virtualities as a function of @xmath0 @xcite . for the calculations ,",
    "it was considered light quarks ( @xmath74 ) with effective mass @xmath75 mev and the target radius @xmath50 gev@xmath49 .",
    "the large @xmath2 region is considered by the freezing of the gluon distribution in this region .",
    "our expression for the observable is then , @xmath76    the behavior is quite consistent with the experimental result , either in shape as in normalization .",
    "the quantity is less sensitive to the non - perturbative content than @xmath7 .",
    "a better description can be obtained by fine tunning the target size or the considered gluon distribution function , however it should be stressed that the present prediction is parameter - free and determined using the dipole picture taking into account unitarity ( saturation ) effects in the effective dipole cross section @xcite .",
    "we verify that the rest frame calculation , taking into account the dipole degrees of freedom and unitarity effects produces similar conclusions to those ones using the breit system .",
    "for instance , in a previous work @xcite , the unitarity corrections to the longitudinal structure function were estimated in the laboratory frame considering the altarelli - martinelli equation , with unitarized expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath77 , obtaining that the expected corrections reach to @xmath78 % as @xmath79 , namely on the kinematical corner of the upcoming thera project .",
    "the higher twist corrections to the longitudinal structure function have been pointed out .",
    "for instance , bartels et al .",
    "@xcite have calculated numerically the twist - four correction obtaining that they are large for @xmath80 and @xmath8 , however having opposite signs .",
    "this fact leads to remaining small effects to the inclusive structure function by almost complete cancellation between those contributions .",
    "the higher twist content is analyzed considering the model @xcite as initial condition .",
    "concerning @xmath8 , it was found that the twist - four correction is large and has negative signal , concluding that a leading twist analysis of @xmath8 is unreliable for high @xmath65 and not too small @xmath0 .",
    "the results are in agreement with the simple parametrization for higher twist ( ht ) studied by the mrst group in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath81 . the second term would parametrize the higher twist content . in our case ,",
    "the unitarity corrections provide an important amount of higher twist content , namely it takes into account some of the several graphs determining the twist expansion .      in perturbative qcd ,",
    "the heavy quark production in electron - proton interaction occurs basicaly through photon - gluon fusion , in which the emitted photon interacts with a gluon from the proton generating a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "therefore , the heavy quark production allows to determine the gluon distribution and the amount of unitarity ( saturation ) effects for the observable .",
    "in particular , charmed mesons have been measured in deep - inelastic at hera and the corresponding structure function @xmath82 is defined from the differential cross section for the @xmath83 pair production .",
    "experimentally , the measurements of the charm structure function are obtained by measuring mesons @xmath84 production @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath82 shows an increase with decreasing @xmath0 at constant values of @xmath65 , whereas the rise becomes sharper at higher virtualities .",
    "the data are consistent with the nlo dglap calculations .",
    "concerning the ratio @xmath85 , the charm contribution to @xmath7 grows steeply as @xmath0 diminishes .",
    "it contributes less than 10% at low @xmath65 and reaches about 30 % for @xmath86 gev@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "once more the color dipole picture will provide a quite simple description for the charm structure function in a factorized way .",
    "now , the glauber - mueller dipole cross section is weighted by the photon wavefunction constituted by a @xmath83 pair with mass @xmath87 .",
    "our expression for the charmed contribution in deep inelastic is thus written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the probability to find in the photon the @xmath83 colo dipole with the charmed quark carrying fraction @xmath16 of the photon s light - cone momentum with @xmath90 polarizations .",
    "for the correspondent wavefunctions , the quark mass in eqs .",
    "( 2,3 ) should be substituted by the charm quark mass @xmath87 . here",
    ", we should take care of the connection between the regge parameter @xmath91 and the bjorken variable @xmath92 . for calculations with",
    "the light quarks these variables are equivalent , however for heavier quarks the correct relation is @xmath93 , e.g. see @xcite : .    in fig .",
    "( [ f2cfig ] ) we show the estimates for the charm structure function as a function of @xmath92 at representative virtualities @xcite . in our calculations , it was used charm mass @xmath94 gev , target size @xmath50 gev@xmath49 and frozen gluon distibution at large @xmath2 .",
    "we have verified small soft contribution , decreasing as the virtuality rises .",
    "there is a slight sensitivity to the value for the charm mass , increasing the overall normalization as @xmath87 diminishes .",
    "such a feature suggests that the charm mass is a hard scale suppressing the non - perturbative contribution to the corresponding cross section .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the recent bfkl color dipole calculations of nikolaev - zoller @xcite and those from donnachie - dosch @xcite .    regarding the breit system description , in ref .",
    "@xcite we found strong corrections to the charm structure function , which are larger than those of the @xmath7 ones .",
    "considering the ratio @xmath95 , the corrections predicted by the glauber - mueller approach would reach 62 % at values of @xmath96 ( thera region ) .",
    "then , an important result is a large deviation of the standard dglap expectations at small @xmath0 for the ratio @xmath85 due to the saturation phenomena ( unitarization ) . with our calculation @xcite one verifies that it is obtained a good description of data in both reference systems , suggesting a consistent estimation of the unitarity effects for that quantity .",
    "mbgd thanks the organizers for the invitation for this talk and both authors enjoyed the lively scientific atmosphere of this meeting ."
