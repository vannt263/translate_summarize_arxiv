    "topological insulators ( tis ) are currently at the forefront of fundamental research in condensed matter physics and their singular electronic properties , such as the existence of dissipationless helical edge states , make them potential candidates for practical uses in low power consumption and spin - based electronic devices @xcite . thus , an extensive literature covering fundamental and practical aspects of tis already exists @xcite .",
    "most of the studies have been concentrated on pristine tis , although the presence of disorder , such as impurities or lattice imperfections , is unavoidable in real devices .",
    "the helical edge states of tis are insensitive to weak disorder due to time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry , but strong disorder can still affect the electronic transport properties of tis , as recently investigated @xcite .",
    "for instance , the stability of the edge states in the presence of disorder has been studied in two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis and an unexpected quantum phase , the topological anderson insulator , was discovered @xcite .",
    "effects of disorder in three - dimensional tis have been also investigated within the anomalous aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite .",
    "disorder effects in low dimensional electronic devices have been a fundamental issue since early studies in the field of mesoscopic physics , particularly concerning the problem of quantum transport@xcite .",
    "it is known that multiple coherent scattering of electrons through disordered quantum wires can give a universal character to the transport in the sense that the statistical properties of the conductance fluctuations depend on few and general physical parameters of the system , such as tr and spin - rotation symmetries , whereas microscopic details are irrelevant . one known result on",
    "this respect is the constant value of the standard deviation of the conductance fluctuations in the diffusive regime , the so - called universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf)@xcite , depending only on the presence of tr and spin - rotation symmetries : the ucf takes the value @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , and 4 .",
    "the symmetry class @xmath2 corresponds to systems that preserve both tr and spin - rotation symmetries , while @xmath1 designates the cases with broken tr symmetry .",
    "if tr symmetry is preserved , but spin - rotation symmetry is broken , we have the symmetry class @xmath0@xcite .",
    "therefore , a statistical study of the conductance fluctuations is naturally linked to the presence of disorder and symmetries play a fundamental role in the analysis",
    ".    distribution moments of the conductance fluctuations such as the average and variance , have been recently experimentally and theoretically investigated in tis @xcite .",
    "although these two conductance moments provide important statistical information , they might not be sufficient for a full statistical description , especially when large conductance fluctuations are present , as frequently happens in experiments . a complete statistical description of the conductance fluctuations is provided by the full distribution of the conductance .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , few works have been devoted to the study of the distribution of the conductance fluctuations in tis@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the conductance fluctuation in a quantum network model is analyzed via the distribution of transmission eigenvalues , while in ref .",
    "@xcite a bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) tight - binding model has been considered to study numerically the conductance distribution in topological anderson insulators .",
    "thus , a thorough theoretical analysis of the conductance fluctuation in 2d ti is needed .        in this work ,",
    "we first calculate the conductance distributions of disordered 2d ti wires modeled by a bhz hamiltonian describing an inverted inas / gasb quantum well known for its practical advantages over other 2d ti materials , including the well - developed material control for fabrication and the tunable band structure by electric fields @xcite .",
    "we obtain the phase diagrams of the mean and standard deviation of the conductance , which reveal three different quantum phases : the metallic ( m ) , the ordinary insulating ( oi ) , and the quantum spin hall insulating ( qshi ) phase .",
    "secondly , to get a full understanding of the statistical properties in each phase and at the transitions , we perform a theoretical analysis based on random matrix theory(rmt)@xcite .",
    "we find that the conductance distributions for 2d ti wires follow the @xmath1 symmetry class in all the phases and transitions except in the strongly disordered metallic region , despite the fact that the bhz hamiltonian is tr invariant . at the m - qshi transition , we need to take into account the different extents of localization of the conducting channels to describe the asymmetric distribution centered around the average conductance @xmath5 . for simplicity , the unit of the conductance of @xmath6 is omitted throughout this paper",
    "similarly , as the system is driven from the qshi to the oi phase , the conductance deviates significantly from @xmath7 , although its fluctuation can be described as in the oi phase ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "our analysis reveals that the edge states play an important role at the phase transitions that involve the qshi phase and the symmetry of the hamiltonian alone is not enough to obtain a full understanding of the statistical properties of the conductance at these transitions .",
    "we adopt the bhz model in the tight - binding representation to describe the electronic properties of the clean inas / gasb ti wires @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 consists of two terms : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 corresponds to a clean ( disorder free ) ti wire , and @xmath11 contains a source of disorder .",
    "the @xmath10 term can be written in a block diagonal form as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the pseudospin , @xmath14 is the site index and @xmath15 is the vector to the nearest neighbor along the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the matrices @xmath17 are in the basis of electron and hole states .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 are material - dependent .",
    "we use the values for those parameters of a inas / gasb quantum well derived from @xmath19 method @xcite : @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev with the lattice constant @xmath24 nm .",
    "the hamiltonian preserves time - reversal symmetry that prevents backscattering of the edge states . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the bulk and structure inversion asymmetry which do not affect the topology of the hamiltonian .    a source of disorder",
    "is introduced in the hamiltonian model by considering a random on - site energy as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a random number uniformly distributed in the range @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 is the @xmath29 identity matrix .    the above bhz tight - binding hamiltonian model is solved numerically .",

    "the calculated band structure of a pristine inas / gasb wire is shown in fig . [ fig_1](a ) . unless stated otherwise , we set the number of sites along the @xmath38- and @xmath39-direction to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , and assume the transport to be along the @xmath39-direction .",
    "the edge states occur in the energy window @xmath42 $ ] mev . the presence of disorder , however , changes the quantum phase of tis and some signatures of these phases can be seen in the phase diagram of the ensemble average conductance @xmath43 in the energy - disorder strength ( @xmath44 ) plane [ see fig .",

    "whereas if the strength of disorder is increased within the energy window @xmath48$]mev , the ti wire becomes an ordinary insulator .",
    "further useful information can be obtained by plotting the standard deviation of the conductance @xmath49 in the @xmath50 plane . from the @xmath51 phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ( c ) , we observe that for energies in @xmath46 $ ] mev and until disorder strength @xmath47 mev ( black region ) the conductance fluctuations are negligible , revealing the robustness of the edge states against disorder in the qshi regime . for higher energies , however , the standard deviation takes the ucf value @xmath52 , which is the representative value of the metallic phase for @xmath1 .",
    "we notice also that at strong disorder strength and high energy , @xmath51 reaches the value 0.73 ( yellow region in fig .",
