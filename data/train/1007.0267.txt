    "modern wireless communication networks are characterized by the coexistence of an increasing number of interfering devices and systems .",
    "while this often leads to an overall system performance that is limited by mutual interference , the presence of many independent wireless devices may also potentially offer new opportunities and performance benefits by allowing _",
    "cooperation_. opportunities for cooperation are further enhanced for _ multistandard _ terminals that are able to communicate simultaneously over multiple radio interfaces , and thus to interact and cooperate with devices belonging to different systems and networks .",
    "for instance , many current wireless terminals are equipped with a 3 g cellular transceiver along with a wi - fi interface .",
    "this paper focuses on investigating the advantages of cooperation in interference - limited scenarios where cooperation is enabled by orthogonal radio interfaces and multistandard terminals .    to fix the ideas on the problem of interest ,",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , where a two - user interference channel ( ic ) operating over a certain bandwidth and using a certain radio communication standard ( say , wi - fi ) is aided by a relay that operates over an orthogonal bandwidth and uses a possibly different standard ( say , bluetooth ) .",
    "for this reason , we refer to the relay as an out - of - band relay ( obr ) .",
    "sources and destinations are assumed to be multistandard , thus being able to transmit and receive , respectively , over both radio interfaces .",
    "the system can be seen as being characterized by two parallel channels , in which the first ( i.e. , the wi - fi channel ) is a standard gaussian ic , and the second ( i.e. , the bluetooth channel ) is a particular gaussian relay channel .",
    "specifically , the second channel is characterized by two sources and destinations communicating through the relay without the direct links between sources and destinations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we refer to it as obr channel ( obrc ) .",
    "the absence of a direct link on the obrc  can be justified in case the wireless radio interface used on the obrc  has a shorter range than the one used over the ic , as it is the case for the wi - fi/ blueetooth example .",
    "we are interested in the optimal operation on the overall system , ic and obrc , which is termed ic with an obr or ic - obr .",
    "as explained above , the two components of an ic - obr model are an ic ( see , e.g , @xcite for a summary of the state of the art on the subject ) and the obrc . assuming a half - duplex relay , the latter is modelled in two different ways ( see fig.[fig : system ] ) : ( _ i _ ) ic - obr type - i :  the obrc is operated by assuming orthogonal transmissions ( e.g. , via tdma  or fdma ) over the four gaussian links connecting sources to relay and relay to destinations ; ( _ ii _ ) ic - obr  type - ii : the obrc  is more generally operated by orthogonalizing the gaussian multiple access channel between the two sources and the relay and the broadcast channel from relay to destinations .",
    "it is noted that relay models similar to the assumed obrc have been recently studied in @xcite from an outage perspective and in @xcite@xcite assuming ( symmetric ) two - way communications ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "overall , it is remarked that general capacity results are unavailable for both component channels of a ic - obr , namely the ic and obrc .    beside the connection with the literature on the two individual component channels , briefly reviewed above",
    ", the considered model is related to , and inspired by , two recent lines of work .",
    "the first deals with _ relaying in interference - limited systems _ , where , unlike the ic - obr , the relay is assumed to operate in the same band as the ic @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these works reveal the fact that relaying in interference - limited systems offers performance benefits not only due to _ signal relaying , _ as for standard relay channels ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but also thanks to the novel idea of _ interference forwarding_. according to the latter , the relay helps by either reinforcing the interference received at the undesired destination so as to facilitate interference stripping , or by conversely reducing the interference via negative beamforming .",
    "achievable schemes incorporating these operations for a gaussian system are developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite , while @xcite deals with a discrete - memoryless model and @xcite derives an upper bound on the capacity region by allocating infinite power to the relay ( see also @xcite for a review ) .    a second related line of work deals with communications over _ parallel ics _ ( albeit the considered",
    "obrc  is not a conventional ic ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite @xcite @xcite , optimal operation over parallel ics , unlike scenarios with a single source or destination , typically entails joint coding over the parallel channels . in other words ,",
    "the signals sent over the parallel ics need to be generally correlated to achieve optimality , and thus a _ separable _ approach , whereby the parallel channels are treated independently , is in general not sufficient . to elaborate , recall that the most general transmission scheme for a regular ic involves splitting of each source s message into both private and common submessages , where the first is treated as noise at the unintended destination , while the latter is jointly decoded with the messages of the intended source .",
    "now , in the presence of parallel ics , given the above , the question arises as to what type of information , either private or common , should be sent over the parallel channels .",
    "for instance , the original work @xcite derives conditions under which correlated transmission of private messages is optimal and @xcite considers the optimality of common information transmission , whereas in @xcite scenarios are found for which sending both correlated private and common messages is optimal .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a summary of special cases in which a separable approach is instead optimal .    for",
    "the ic - obr  under study , the main issue we are interested in is assessing under which conditions the obrc  should be optimally used for either or both _ signal relaying _ or _ interference forwarding _ , and by following a _ _  separable _ _ or _",
    "non - separable _ transmission strategy over the parallel channels given by the ic and the obrc .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is the identification of a number of such scenarios , which we classify as being characterized by _ relay - to - destinations bottleneck _ or _ excess rate conditions _",
    ", for both ic - obr type - i and type - ii and assuming both fixed and variable bandwidth allocations on the obrc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : system models ] , we give the system models of ic - obr type - i and type - ii channels .",
    "section [ sec : icobr_ind_chn ] gives a general outer bound and achievable region for ic - obr type - i for both fixed and variable obrc  bandwidth allocations .",
    "capacity results are established for both cases . in section [ sec : ic - obr type ii ] , we give outer bounds on the capacity region for ic - obr  type - ii .",

    "this can be realized by orthogonal access schemes such as tdma  or fdma .",
    "specifically , we have two gaussian channels from sources @xmath26 to relay @xmath29 with fraction of channel uses @xmath0 , @xmath13 and two gaussian channels from the relay @xmath29 to destinations @xmath17 @xmath13 with fraction of channel uses @xmath30 we have @xmath31 .",

    "we propose to use a rate splitting scheme similar to the standard approach for ics @xcite @xcite .",
    "specifically , we split the message of each user into private and common messages , where the private message of each source is to be decoded only by the intended destination and the common is to be decoded at both intended and interfered destinations .",
    "however , private and common parts are further split into two ( independent ) messages as follows .",
    "one of the private message splits is sent over the ic and the other one over the obrc . as for the common message ,",
    "both parts are sent over the ic , but one of the two is also sent over the obrc to the interfered destination for interference cancellation .",
    "more specifically , we have the following four - way split of each message @xmath14 @xmath75 , @xmath2 , where : ( _ i _ ) @xmath76 $ ] is a private message that is transmitted via the obrc only , directly to @xmath46 .",

    "proof : _ appendix b.      here we review the main capacity results for ic - obr type - i with fixed and variable bandwidth allocation that will be detailed in the following .",
    "we are interested in assessing under which conditions signal relaying or a combination of signal relaying and interference forwarding attain optimal peformance .",
    "according to the discussion above , optimality of signal relaying alone implies that separable operation on the ic - obr is optimal , whereas , if interference forwarding is needed , a separable scheme ( at least in the class of strategies we considered ) is not sufficient to attain optimal performance .",
    "the derived optimality conditions set constraints on both the ic and obrc  channel gains .",
    "all results are obtained from the outer bound of proposition 1 and the achievable rate region of proposition 2 .    starting with _ fixed _ bandwidth allocation , we first classify ic - obr systems  on the basis of the channel conditions on the obrc . specifically , we distinguish two regimes :    * _ relay - to - destinations ( r - to - d ) bottleneck regime _ : in this regime , along the signal paths @xmath107 on the obrc ,  for @xmath13 the relay to destinations links form the performance bottleneck . in other words , the channel from source @xmath26 to relay @xmath29 is better than the one from relay @xmath29 to destination @xmath46 for @xmath59 specifically , we have the conditions @xmath108 * _ excess rate regime _ : in this regime , the bottleneck condition is not satisfied and we assume that @xmath109 a symmetric regime can also be equivalently considered where the second inequality in ( [ bottleneck_conditions ] ) is violated rather than the first as in ( [ ex_rate_conditions ] ) . for reasons that will be made clear below , under condition ( [ ex_rate_conditions ] ) ,",
    "we define the _ excess rate _ from @xmath7 to @xmath8 on the obrc as @xmath110    we first show that in the r - to - d bottleneck regime , _ irrespective of the channel gains over the ic _ , signal relaying alone , and thus _ separable _ operation , is optimal ( proposition 3 ) . in particular , in this regime",
    ", it is optimal to transmit only _ private _ information over the obrc at the maximum rate @xmath111 on each link @xmath112 since this rate is limited by ( [ bottleneck_conditions ] ) , we have @xmath113 for @xmath59 notice every bit of private rate @xmath111 directly adds one bit to the overall achievable rate for the pair @xmath114 since it consists of independent information sent directly to the destination @xmath46 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we then turn to the excess rate regime ( [ ex_rate_conditions ] ) ( symmetric results clearly holds by swapping indices 1 and 2 ) .",
    "assume that both sources transmit private bits over the obrc at their maximum rate @xmath115 given condition ( [ ex_rate_conditions ] ) , this leads to @xmath116 and @xmath117 as said , these bits directly contribute to the overall achievable rates for the two source - destination pairs .",
    "having allocated such rates for signal relaying , one is left with the _ excess rate _ ( [ ex_rate ] ) on the obrc  between source @xmath7 and destination @xmath118 this excess rate can be potentially used for interference relaying .",
    "we show that the discussed rate allocation over the obrc with interference forwarding at the excess rate is optimal in two specific regimes of channel gains over the ic .",
    "more precisely , we prove that signal relaying and interference forwarding ( via the excess rate ) is optimal in case destination @xmath9 is in either _ strong _ interference conditions on the ic ( i.e. , @xmath119 in proposition 4 or _",
    "weak _ interference conditions ( i.e. , @xmath120 in proposition 5 . in both cases , the excess rate ( [ ex_rate ] ) on the obrc  link @xmath121 thanks to _ interference forwarding _ , has the effect of pushing destination @xmath8 in a `` strong '' interference regime over the ic - obr , so that @xmath8 can decode source @xmath7 s messages without loss of optimality .",
    "proposition 4 is thus akin to the standard strong - interference capacity region result for the gaussian ic @xcite , while proposition 5 is akin to the mixed - interference sum - capacity result for the gaussian ic @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that here strong and weak interference conditions are attained on the ic - obr and not on the ic alone ( destination @xmath8 is generally not in the strong interference regime on the ic alone ) .",
    "we also show that , if destination @xmath8 is already in sufficiently strong interference conditions on the ic alone , interference forwarding over the obrc  becomes unnecessary ( see remark 3 and 4 ) .",
    "we then consider variable bandwith allocation over the obrc and show that under appropriate conditions , allocating all the bandwidth to the better path for signal relaying is optimal , while this is not the case under more general assumptions and interference forwarding may be useful .      in this section ,",
    "we detail the capacity results reviewed above for fixed obrc bandwidth allocation .",
    "we first focus on the r - to - d bottleneck regime ( [ bottleneck_conditions ] ) . the proposition is expressed in terms of the capacity region @xmath122 of a standard ic , which is generally unknown in single - letter formulation apart from special cases .    * * proposition 3 ( r - to - d bottleneck regime**@xmath123 * : * for a ic - obr  type - i with fixed obrc  bandwidth allocation , under condition ( [ bottleneck_conditions ] ) , the capacity region @xmath124 is given by the capacity region @xmath125 of the ic , enhanced by ( @xmath126 along the individual rates as @xmath127 for @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
