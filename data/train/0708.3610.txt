    "the inter - quark interaction is one of the fundamental and essential properties linking elementary physics and hadron physics . in particular ,",
    "the three - quark interaction in baryons is characteristic and complicated , reflecting the nontrivial gluonic dynamics based on the su(3 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "in addition , the three - quark system has also large varieties of the quark motion , configuration , and so on .",
    "the heavy - heavy - light quark ( @xmath0 ) system is a suitable material to investigate such a light - quark effect on the three - quark interaction .    in 2002 , the first doubly charmed baryon , @xmath6 , was experimentally observed at selex , fermilab @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a decay process @xmath7 was observed , and its mass was measured about 3519 mev . in another experiment , a decay process @xmath8 was also confirmed @xcite .",
    "doubly charmed baryons are also theoretically investigated in lattice qcd @xcite and other approaches @xcite .",
    "since @xmath9 quark is much heavier than @xmath10 quark , this system can be idealized as the three - body system constructed with two static quarks and one finite - mass quark moving around .    motivated by these considerations , we investigate the @xmath0 system in quenched lattice qcd .",
    "we extract the @xmath0 potential @xmath11 , which is defined as the energy of the @xmath0 system in terms of the inter - heavy - quark distance @xmath4 . in lattice qcd , the quark - antiquark ( @xmath12 ) potential @xcite and the static three - quark ( @xmath13 ) potential @xcite",
    "are already found to be described as the linear confinement potential plus the one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential .",
    "the confinement potential is proportional to the length of the gluonic flux connecting the quarks , and the string tension is about 0.89 gev / fm .",
    "in contrast to these static quark potentials , our @xmath0 potential includes not only the gluonic effect but also the nontrivial finite - mass valence quark effect .",
    "thus the @xmath0 potential behavior would have some difference from the static cases .",
    "( a)the gauge - invariant @xmath0 wilson loop .",
    "the wavy line represents the light - quark propagator and the straight line the heavy - quark trajectory .",
    "( b)the  wall - to - wall @xmath0 wilson loop . \"",
    "the gray wavy lines represent the wall - to - wall quark propagator , which propagates from the whole space at one time to that at another time . ]",
    "the @xmath0 wilson loop is defined in almost the same manner as the static @xmath13 wilson loop @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the light quark is treated as the quark propagator @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge - invariant @xmath0 wilson loop with the spatial size @xmath4 and the temporal size @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 with the path - ordered product of the link variables @xmath17 along the heavy - quark trajectory @xmath18 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath19 are color indices .",
    "the schematic figure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the @xmath0 potential is obtained as @xmath20 the symbol @xmath21 means the expectation value integrated over the gauge field .",
    "all we have to do is to get the expectation value from lattice qcd for several values of @xmath4 and to give a suitable function form of @xmath11 .",
    ".[tab1 - 2 ] the correspondence between @xmath22 and the used gauge configuration number @xmath23 .",
    "the list shows the pion mass @xmath24 , the @xmath25 meson mass @xmath26 , and the approximate constituent quark mass @xmath27 .",
    "the meson masses are obtained from the meson correlator with the wall source and the point sink .",
    "the statistical error is estimated with the jackknife method . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in our @xmath0 potential , the significant result is the reduction of the effective string tension . to understand this result",
    ", we compare the string tension with the effective string tension . in the @xmath12 case",
    ", the color flux - tube length corresponds to the distance between the quark and the antiquark , and thus @xmath28 is the proportionality coefficient of the inter - quark distance in the confinement potential .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath13 case , @xmath29 is the proportionality coefficient of the flux - tube length that minimally connects the three quarks @xcite .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 system , the inter - quark distance @xmath4 is _ not _ the flux - tube length .",
    "the @xmath0 flux - tube length is determined by complicated light - quark dynamics , and therefore @xmath11 does not have to be proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the actual lattice qcd results suggest that the long - range @xmath0 potential is proportional to @xmath4 at least for @xmath30 fm , but the effective string tension @xmath31 as its proportionality coefficient is reduced by the existence of the light quark , which is conjectured to originate from the difference between @xmath4 and the flux - tube length .",
    "now we consider the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 potential . in the large @xmath4 limit ,",
    "the confinement potential between the two heavy quarks will dominate , and the color flux - tube length approximately equals to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore @xmath31 would approach to @xmath32 , which will be confirmed with a larger - volume calculation .",
    "there is another asymptotic behavior we can check , that is , the limit in which the light quark is  heavy \" .",
    "if the light - quark mass goes to infinite , the @xmath0 system should correspond to the static @xmath13 system .",
    "it means that @xmath33 becomes larger in the larger light - quark mass and @xmath34 in the infinite mass limit .",
    "we can confirm this behavior from the lattice result in the heaviest case , @xmath35 , in table [ tab3 ] .    in our another work @xcite",
    ", we investigate the same @xmath0 potential in a non - relativistic quark model .",
    "it reproduces the lattice qcd result , and enables us to understand the reduction mechanism of @xmath31 .",
    "we confirm that a geometrical difference between the flux - tube length and @xmath4 is essential for the reduction of @xmath31 , as conjectured above .",
    "we mention another possible light - quark effect on the interquark potential , i.e. , the sea quark effect .",
    "the sea quark effect causes the string breaking , which is the disappearance of the string tension at a long distance .",
    "the sea quark effect is obtained with the unquenched lattice qcd calculation , and is found to be important at the long range where the flux - tube length is larger than about 1 fm @xcite .",
    "the effective string tension in the realistic @xmath0 system would be also affected by such a sea quark effect in further large-@xmath4 region .",
    "although our lattice calculation is restricted to the specific gauge , we come to the following general conclusion about the effective string tension , which would not be affected by the nonlocality of the coulomb gauge . owing to the existence of a mobile quark",
    ", the effective string tension @xmath31 between the other two quarks can be reduced from the string tension in mesons @xmath36 or baryons @xmath32 .",
    "since the reason for the reduction is fairly simple and general , this argument holds for not only @xmath0 systems but also three finite - mass quark systems , i.e. , ordinary baryons , such as a nucleon . in addition , this can be also applied to the multi - quark system including light quarks @xcite . for more quantitative calculation for realistic hadrons",
    ", we need careful consideration about realistic quark masses , finite - volume effects , sea quark effects , and more complicated valence quark effects .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the @xmath0 potential in su(3 ) quenched lattice qcd . for the error reduction",
    ", we have fixed the gauge field with the coulomb gauge , and investigated the long - distance behavior .",
    "the effective string tension @xmath33 is 10 - 20% reduced , compared to the string tension in the static case , in @xmath37 fm and 0.5 gev @xmath38 gev .",
    "the light - quark mass dependence of the reduction is also investigated .",
    "the effective string tension means the inter - two - quark confining force in baryons , and its reduction by the finite - mass valence quark effect is conjectured to be a general property for baryons and multi - quark hadrons .",
    "the significant change of the fundamental inter - quark force is important not only for qcd but also for the quark - hadron and nuclear physics .",
