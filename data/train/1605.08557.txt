    "we use forced rf evaporation  @xcite , followed by plain evaporation in a levitated optical trap ( @xmath9 )  @xcite , to create a high phase - space density mixture of @xmath10 atoms of each species at a temperature of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "molecules are produced from this atomic mixture by sweeping the magnetic field across an interspecies feshbach resonance at @xmath12 at a rate of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "after magnetoassociation , molecules populate the near - threshold @xmath14 spin - stretched bound state of the potential @xmath15 as shown in figure  [ molecularpotentials](b ) . here , states are labeled as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vibrational quantum number counted downward from the dissociation threshold for the particular hyperfine @xmath18 manifold , and @xmath19 is the standard letter designation for the molecular rotational angular momentum quantum number  @xcite .",
    "we transfer our molecules to the weakly bound @xmath20 state by reducing the magnetic field to @xmath21 , at which point the atoms and molecules are separated using the stern - gerlach effect ( at a field gradient of @xmath22 ) , taking advantage of their different magnetic moments when the molecules are in this state .",
    "we then reduce the magnetic field gradient and ramp up the dipole trap to create a pure optical trap .",
    "finally , the magnetic field is ramped to @xmath23 to transfer the molecules into a state which is suitable for transfer to the rovibrational ground state .",
    "this results in @xmath24 molecules in the @xmath25 state at a temperature of @xmath26 .",

    "transitions to the highlighted states are allowed by selection rules .",
    "dots indicate the states we address with our laser system . ]",
    "the weakly bound molecules are transferred to the rovibrational ground state optically using stirap .",
    "we couple both the initial near - dissociation state and the ground state to a common excited state .",
    "this excited state is chosen to be the @xmath34 state , from the coupled @xmath35 potential , because it has strong couplings to both the feshbach and ground states  @xcite .",
    "the pump and stokes lasers are shown schematically in figure  [ molecularpotentials](a ) , and have frequencies of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) respectively . for coherent transfer ,",
    "we narrow the linewidth of both pump and stokes lasers to @xmath40 by frequency stabilisation to a fixed - length high - finesse optical cavity constructed from ultra - low - expansion ( ule ) glass by atfilms .",

    "the sequence keeps the molecules in the ground state for @xmath41 before transferring them back to the initial state for dissociation and absorption imaging . we show a numerical model of the feshbach and ground state populations based on the lindblad master equation for an open three - level system , including the effects of laser linewidth .",
    "the one - way transfer efficiency is 88% .",
    "the optical trap is switched off throughout the sequence . ]",
    "we transfer the molecules to the ground state and back as shown in figure  [ pulseseq ] .",
    "this figure shows a model of the lindblad master equation for an open three - level system , using our measured peak rabi frequencies of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the pump and stokes transitions respectively .",
    "the details of this model will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "as the dipole trapping wavelength is close to the pump transition , it induces an ac stark shift of @xmath44 .",
    "this shift varies across the cloud because of the finite size of the molecular cloud and trapping beams , reducing the efficiency of the transfer . to avoid this we switch our dipole trap off for @xmath45 during the stirap transfer to and from the ground state",
    "this improves our one - way transfer efficiency from 50%  @xcite to 88% , creating a sample of over 2000 molecules in the rovibrational ground state .",
    "we determine the binding energy with precision measurements of the pump and stokes transition frequencies using a gps - referenced frequency comb .",
    "our frequency comb is the first of its kind , based on difference frequency generation technology developed by toptica photonics ag  @xcite . in this comb",
    ", the amplified output of an er : fiber oscillator is compressed using a silicon prism compressor and then spectrally broadened using a highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber to make a supercontinuum spanning more than an optical octave .",
    "the comb teeth in the spectrum are given by @xmath46 .",
    "two extreme parts of this supercontinuum are spatially and temporally overlapped in a nonlinear difference frequency generation ( dfg ) crystal .",
    "this cancels the carrier - envelope offset frequency ( @xmath47 ) to produce an offset - free frequency comb spectrum at @xmath48 with a bandwidth of @xmath49 .",
    "each comb tooth @xmath50 then has a frequency @xmath51 .",
    "this output is then extended to different wavelength ranges by nonlinear frequency shifting and frequency doubling .",
    "this method to cancel @xmath47 has the advantage of requiring no servo - loop feedback system , compared to the conventional @xmath52 approach where the high - frequency noise components of @xmath47 can not be canceled  @xcite .",

    "( b )  ad of the beat signal between two identical dfg combs locked to a common reference .",
    "the beat was recorded at a wavelength of @xmath56 via a transfer oscillator  @xcite . ]",
    "the frequency comb is seeded by a mode - locked er : fibre laser with an @xmath57 repetition rate , whose 10th harmonic is locked to an @xmath58 ultra - low - noise oven - controlled rf oscillator , which in turn is locked to a @xmath55 gps reference ( jackson labs fury ) .",
    "we have measured the absolute stability of the comb locked to the gps reference by recording a beat note between a comb tooth and a laser stabilized to the rb 5s@xmath59=2)@xmath535p@xmath54=3 ) line .",
    "figure [ frequencycomb](a ) shows the allan deviation ( ad ) of the beat signal , compared to the ad of the gps referenced oscillator to which the comb is locked .",
    "the ad of the beat follows a similar trend to the reference signal but deviates at longer time scales .",
    "this deviation is due to the drift in the lock - signal offset of the laser locked to the rb spectroscopy line and is commonly observed over such time scales .",
    "these results show that measuring uncertainties down to @xmath60 is practical with our comb system .",
    "to quantify the lock noise of the comb , we measure the ad of a beat signal between two combs locked to a common rf reference .",
    "we observe an overall ad lower than the reference signal with no similarity to the ad of the reference signal ( figure  [ frequencycomb](b ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the ad of the reference rf is completely canceled in this measurement and the ad related to lock noise is much smaller than that .",
    "therefore we can consider the ad of the gps signal at time scales greater than our experimental cycle to calculate the resulting deviation on the repetition rate .",
    "the frequency difference between the two stirap lasers is measured with comb teeth separated by @xmath61 , so the uncertainty in the gps clock frequency must be less than @xmath62 if we are to maintain an uncertainty in our measured laser frequency of less than @xmath63 .",
    "the ad over time scales shorter than the experimental cycle will add to the statistical error of the molecular round - trip signal .",
    "however , the ad over longer time scales will lead to a systematic offset in our measurements . from the specifications of the gps reference we calculate that , over the course of one measurement , the ad leads to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath64 on the frequency difference between the two lasers .",
    "this is negligible compared to the other sources of uncertainty described later .",
    "the absolute frequency of the lasers is measured by beating light from each of the stirap lasers with the nearest tooth of the optical frequency comb . a schematic diagram of the optical setup used to measure the beat note and the comb tooth number is shown in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "the beat note is recorded on a spectrum analyzer ( agilent n9320b for the stokes , agilent n1996 for the pump ) , which is referenced to the same @xmath55 gps clock as the comb .",
    "the frequency of the beat note is averaged and recorded over each three - second interval .",
    "we identify the nearest comb tooth ( @xmath50 ) using a wavemeter with an absolute accuracy of @xmath65 ( high finesse ws - u ) , which we calibrate with lasers locked to well - known spectral lines in rb , cs and sr .",
    "the light reaching the molecules is offset from that sent to the frequency comb by a pair of acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) , at @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the pump and stokes respectively .",
    "these provide the analog intensity ramps for stirap , and are driven by isomet 532b fixed - frequency driver / amplifiers .",
    "we measure the accuracy of the absolute frequency of these drivers on a spectrum analyser ( agilent n1996 referenced to the @xmath55 gps clock ) and find a constant offset of @xmath68 from the nominal @xmath57 .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on this offset is negligible .",
    "maximum stirap transfer efficiency is achieved when the laser frequencies meet the two - photon resonance condition , while any common detuning of both lasers has relatively little effect on the efficiency  @xcite . by scanning their frequency difference and observing where we get maximum transfer efficiency , we determine the energy difference between the initial state @xmath27 and final state @xmath29 .",
    "to measure the energy difference , we fix the frequency of the pump laser on resonance with the feshbach and intermediate states .",
    "we then vary the frequency of the stokes laser and measure the efficiency of the stirap transfer .",
    "the beat notes of both lasers with the optical frequency comb are measured throughout . for each data point",
    "we subtract the pump and stokes absolute frequencies measured with the comb , and add the shifts from the aoms , to get an absolute frequency difference .",
    "this gives us a peak as a function of stokes frequency which we fit to determine the energy difference between the initial and final states , as shown in figure  [ fig_vh1_vv1 ] .",
    "the optimal stokes frequency is determined over @xmath69 hours .    .",
    "black circles show the transfer to the @xmath70 state , while red squares show the @xmath71 state .",
    "gaussian fits give a separation between the states of @xmath72 . ]",
    "the precision with which we can locate the two - photon resonance is limited by the shot - to - shot noise in the number of molecules which we produce .",
    "this noise results in the vertical error bars seen in figure  [ fig_vh1_vv1 ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the detuning ( the horizontal error bars ) are too small to be seen .",
    "a gaussian fit gives an uncertainty on the center of the spectroscopic feature of around @xmath73 .",
    "the magnetic field is measured before and after each complete measurement using the microwave transition frequency between the @xmath74 and @xmath75 states in atomic cs .",
    "we found the same frequency difference between the pump and stokes transition , within our experimental uncertainty , when using @xmath76 as an alternative intermediate state .",
    "this measurement was carried out using two - photon spectroscopy ( where both the pump and stokes light are pulsed on simultaneously ) as the coupling strengths are not high enough for efficient stirap transfer .",
    "the experimental procedure for the two - photon spectroscopy of the ground state has been discussed previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method , and the different transition strengths and linewidths , results in a much wider spectroscopic signal , leading to much larger uncertainties on the two - photon resonance .",
    "we will now combine the measured energy difference and magnetic field with theoretical models , to determine the energy difference between the degeneracy - weighted centres of the atomic and molecular hyperfine manifolds .",
    "we must correct for several shifts which are included in our measurement : the atomic hyperfine splittings , the zeeman shifts of the @xmath77 and @xmath31 atomic states , the binding energy of the feshbach molecule relative to these atomic states , and the molecular ground - state hyperfine splitting and zeeman shift .",
    "the effects of all of these shifts are summarised in table  [ tab : allerrors ] .",
    "we will discuss each of these below .",
    ".[tab : allerrors ] all the corrections , and their respective experimental errors , which must be added to our measurement of the energy difference @xmath78 to give the energy difference between the degeneracy - weighted hyperfine centroids of the free atoms and the rbcs rovibrational ground state , _",
    "i.e. _ the binding energy .",
    "the uncertainty in the zeeman shift is from the uncertainty in the measured magnetic field .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties apply as explained in the text .",
    "the values shown are from the second measurement in figure  [ finalvalues ] at a magnetic field @xmath79 driving a transition to the @xmath80 hyperfine ground state .",
    "all values are in mhz . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     this value is a 500-fold improvement in accuracy over previous measurements averaging @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the most precise determinations of a molecular binding energy we know of are precisions of @xmath82 .",
    "these are in @xmath83k@xmath0rb , which is measured with @xmath84 precision at a finite magnetic field  @xcite , and @xmath85 with @xmath86 precision  @xcite .",
    "our fractional uncertainty is @xmath87 , and improved models and measurements of the feshbach and ground - state structure could reduce this as far as @xmath88 .",
    "we have measured the binding energy of the @xmath0rb@xmath1cs molecule as @xmath4 using an optical frequency comb based on difference - frequency generation  @xcite .",
    "the results for different intermediate states @xmath89 apart agree within their experimental uncertainty and we are able to resolve the nuclear zeeman splitting of the molecular ground state",
    ". the accuracy of our ground - state binding energy measurement is limited by uncertainties in the theoretical models of the molecular structure .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the most accurate determination to date of the dissociation energy of a molecule .",
    "the ability to measure molecular transitions with high precision is also potentially relevant to searches for variations in fundamental constants such as the electron - proton mass ratio  @xcite .",
