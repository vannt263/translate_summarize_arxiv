    "nonetheless , such an assumption is still a limitation and hinders our study in sparse networks . in this work",
    ", we endeavor to extend our analytical framework to a general choice of @xmath0 , so long as the expected meeting time between the message set and the non - message set is finite . note that disconnected networks are widely seen in networks with sparse population and/or with secondary licence @xcite and/or under malicious attack@xcite .",

    "3 .   a quantitative tradeoff analysis between mobility and connectivity in terms of information spreading effectiveness",
    "is given , which provides insights into how mobility may be exploited to compensate for network connectivity deficiency .",
    "we briefly introduce the system model for completeness , and more details can be found in @xcite .",

    "our model allows general forms of @xmath18 ; in this paper , however , we will focus on several popular mobility models further detailed below .      without loss of generality ,",
    "we consider the problem of single - piece information dissemination through a natural randomized gossip algorithm @xcite , and adopt the  move - and - gossip \" paradigm first proposed in @xcite to facilitate the analysis .",
    "specifically , each time slot is divided into two phases : each node first _",
    "moves _ and then _ gossips _ with _ one _ of its _ new _ neighboring nodes .",

    "a careful examination of our derivation of @xmath32 in @xcite reveals that no connectivity requirement is imposed .",

    "one striking observation from above study is that , even in a network with transmission range @xmath0 far below the connectivity threshold , information can still be spread granted sufficient mobility .",
    "a question naturally arises as to how much mobility is needed to facilitate information spreading given a certain degree of connectivity . aided by our mobile conductance evaluations , some quantitative tradeoff between network dynamism and connectivity",

    "note that other meaningful performance benchmarks may also be used in our following discussion .      in this case , we are interested in determining how much velocity can make up for the deficiency in network connectivity due to small transmission range .",

    ", there exists a tradeoff between @xmath59 and @xmath0 , in which the _ effective velocity _ is inversely proportional to the square of transmission range @xmath0 .",
    "( 2 ) when @xmath91 , even fully random mobility can not recover the spreading time of @xmath86 .",
    "nonetheless , information can still be spread to the whole network given sufficiently high velocity , only at a slower speed ( see discussion in iii.a ) .      similarly , by comparing the result of",
    "with the static conductance of a ring graph @xmath88 a necessary condition for achieving the same information spreading performance as in a worst - case connected graph can be obtained as @xmath92    _ remarks : _ there exists a tradeoff between the mobility ratio @xmath93 and @xmath0 for effective message spreading . with the reasonable assumption that @xmath94 , the _ effective mobility ratio _ is given by @xmath95      following the same approach as above , a necessary condition for effective message spreading with this mobility model is @xmath96    _ remarks : _ there exists a tradeoff between the mobility balance @xmath97 and @xmath0 for effective message spreading .",
