    "in many areas of astrophysics , the _ thermal instability _ is often invoked to explain the condensation of cold dense clouds out of a hot background medium . in the simplistic picture of the thermal instability ,",
    "the overdense region surrounded by the hotter background undergoes a `` quasi - static compression '' in near pressure equilibrium .",
    "this `` near - equilibrium '' case of the evolution , however , is valid only when the cloud is small enough to adjust to pressure change faster than it cools  its size must be much smaller than the distance that sound wave travels in a cooling time , @xmath7 .",
    "the collapse of thermally unstable clouds in either x - ray cluster cooling flows or protogalactic halos has been studied previously by numerical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these simulations showed that a spherically symmetric cloud cools and undergoes a supersonic compression , if the cloud size is @xmath8 .",
    "such supersonic compression leads to a central density increase two to three orders of magnitude higher than what is expected from the isobaric compression . on the other hand",
    ", a small cloud of @xmath9 cools isobarically and undergoes a quasi - static compression , while a big cloud of @xmath10 cools nearly isochorically with only small density increase .",
    "while most previous studies on the thermal instability considered the collapse of one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherically symmetric clouds , @xcite simulated the collapse of a non - spherical , elongated blob in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) polar geometry and showed the development of a `` shape instability '' .",
    "as the perturbation is compressed by the background pressure , the compression wave travels the same distance with the sound speed ( @xmath11 ) along both the major and minor axes , and the induced infall velocity field is not radial .",
    "this causes the compressed region to be more elongated and enhances the degree of non - sphericity .",
    "they showed that an oblate cloud with an initial axial ratio of @xmath12 collapses to a flat pancake , and argued that the evolution of oblate clouds becomes similar to that of 1d plane - parallel collapses . from this simulation",
    "one can deduce that the shape instability would also occur in a prolate cloud , resulting in a thin rod - shape condensation . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the effects of different geometries by 1d plane - parallel and 1d spherical symmetric simulations of thermally unstable clouds using a ppm ( piecewise parabolic method ) hydrodynamic code with self - gravity and radiative cooling .",
    "we found that isotropic compression leads to much higher central density , accompanied by accelerated radiative cooling , in the spherically symmetric case , while the density increases only to the isobaric ratio of @xmath13 in the plane - parallel case . here",
    "@xmath14 is the mean molecular weight , and the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for cool and hot , respectively .",
    "thus , we expect that the cloud shape is an important factor in the collapse and evolution of thermally unstable clouds . in this contribution",
    ", we explore in detail how _ non - spherical _ perturbations in a _ primordial _ environment evolve under the influence of the thermal instability .    in many models of globular cluster ( gc )",
    "formation , dense protoglobular cluster clouds ( pgccs ) are supposed to exist in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas in protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "the model by @xcite , which has been most widely adopted to explain the existence of such pgccs , relies on the thermal instability for the formation of pgccs in a protogalactic halo . in our study",
    "the parameters have been adjusted so the simulations for the nonlinear development of the thermal instability are applicable to the condensation of pgccs , although the generic results should hold to the thermal instability of any objects .",
    "we have ignored self - gravity , because the gravitational time scale is much longer than the cooling time scale during the early collapse stage of pgccs .",
    "but the self - gravity should be important in the gravitational fragmentation of pgccs during the later evolutionary stage when the clouds have cooled down to @xmath3k .    in next section ,",
    "we describe our model and numerical method .",
    "the simulation results are presented in  iii , followed by the conclusions in  iv .",
    "we expect that inside a protogalactic halo , density perturbations on a wide range of length scales exist and flow motions are likely turbulent .",
    "while the thermal instability under such realistic global pictures can be explored later @xcite , here we first take a much simpler and local approach .",
    "we consider isolated overdense clouds embedded in a hot , uniform , and static background gas of @xmath17k and @xmath18 .",
    "this temperature corresponds to that of an isothermal sphere with circular velocity @xmath19 , representing the halo of disk galaxies like the milky way galaxy .",
    "@xmath20 is the background density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is chosen as a fiducial value , because then spheres of radius @xmath21 would have mass scales relevant for gc formation ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "we assume the ratio of he / h number densities is 1/10 , so that the gas mass density is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the initial density of the overdense clouds , @xmath23 , is assumed to decrease gradually from the center to edge , @xmath24^{1/2 } \\biggr\\ } \\right]\\ ] ] for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the cloud radii along the @xmath28 and @xmath29 axes , respectively .",
    "the ratio of @xmath30 determines the shape of the initial clouds ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "the initial temperature throughout the clouds is set by the isobaric condition , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the amplitude of initial density perturbations , @xmath32 , is a free parameter that determines the density contrast between the cloud center and the background .",
    "if this amplitude is linear ( @xmath33 ) and if there are no heat sources that balance the radiative cooling of the background gas , then both the cloud and the background gas cool together and the thermal instability would not have enough time to grow . because the cooling time scales as @xmath34 , the contrast in @xmath35 between the cloud and the background is small for small @xmath32 .",
    "in real protogalaxies , however , the halo gas would be heated by possible energy sources such as supernova explosions , shocks , and etc .",
    "if the background gas maintains a high temperature owing to those energy inputs , perturbations would grow approximately under the isobaric condition until they become nonlinear . also these heating processes likely",
    "induce turbulent flow motions and non - linear density fluctuations in the halo medium as well . in numerical simulations",
    "the overall evolution proceeds faster for larger values of @xmath32 during the linear phase , but it becomes almost independent of the initial values of @xmath32 , once perturbations become non - linear . since we do not include any background heating processes in our simulations , we need to have a reasonably large density contrast in order to see the nonlinear growth and to expedite the simulations .",
    "thus , we begin with @xmath36 for all models , which in fact would be consistent with turbulent nature of the halo medium .",
    "the key idea of the gc formation model based on the thermal instability , originally suggested by @xcite , is that the characteristic mass scale of gcs , @xmath37 , can be explained by the imprinting of the jeans mass of the gas clouds at @xmath38k that have cooled from a hot halo gas in pressure equilibrium .",
    "if the clouds were allowed to cool well below @xmath3 k in a time scale shorter than the free - fall time scale , they would not retain the memory of the imprinted mass scale .",
    "so in this work we consider the cases where the radiative cooling is ineffective below @xmath3k .",
    "if the halo gas had been enriched by the metals from the first objects , or if molecules have formed efficiently via gas phase reactions , then the gas would have cooled well below @xmath3 k before the jeans mass was imprinted @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a primordial gas with @xmath39 and @xmath40 only , and we assume that the formation of molecules is prohibited due to uv radiation from central agns or diffuse background radiation @xcite , resulting in zero cooling for @xmath41k .    here , we define the cooling rate as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the energy loss rate per unit volume and @xmath44 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei . in general , the cooling rate coefficient , @xmath45 , is a function of temperature as well as ionization fractions that can be dependent on the thermal and ionization history of gas . when a hot gas cools from @xmath46 , in particular , it recombines out of ionization equilibrium , because the cooling time scale is shorter than the recombination time scale @xcite .",
    "so in order to calculate the non - equilibrium cooling rate accurately , the time - dependent equations for ionization fractions should be solved , which can be computationally expensive .",
    "fortunately , however , the non - equilibrium cooling rate for the gas _ cooling under the isobaric condition _ becomes a function of temperature only , if the initial temperature is high enough to ensure the initial ionization equilibrium ( @xmath47k ) and if only two - body collisional processes are included . in that case , @xmath45 can be represented by a tabulated form as a function of temperature only .",
    "we adopt , as our standard cooling model , the non - equilibrium radiative cooling rate for a zero - metalicity , optically thin gas that is calculated by following the non - equilibrium collisional ionization of the gas cooling from @xmath48k to @xmath3 k under the isobaric condition @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath49 for @xmath41k and , in addition , set the minimum temperature at @xmath50k .    in order to explore the effects of different cooling rates , we have also calculated several models with the following cooling rates , in addition to the standard cooling model ( neqm0 ) : 1 ) the ciem0 model : the collisional ionization equilibrium cooling for a zero - metalicity gas , 2 ) the neqm1 model : the non - equilibrium cooling rate for a gas with the metalicity , @xmath51 .",
    "the neqm1 model is not consistent with our assumption of zero cooling rate below @xmath38 , but has been included for comparison .",
    "figure 1 shows the cooling rate coefficients for these cooling models .",
    "as the central part of the cloud cools , a steep temperature gradient develops between the cloud and hot background medium and the thermal conduction can become operative there .",
    "@xcite showed , however , that their simulation results differ by @xmath523% when the reduced thermal conductivity @xcite was included .",
    "thus we ignore the thermal conduction in our calculations , although possibly it may be important .",
    "we define the cooling time as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the internal energy per unit volume , and @xmath55 is the number density of ions and electrons . with the standard neqm0 cooling model ,",
    "the cooling time for the background halo gas is @xmath56 with @xmath57k .",
    "figure 1 shows the cooling time for a gas cooling under the isobaric condition ( @xmath58= constant ) for three cooling models .",
    "the cooling time for the gas at the cloud center is given by @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath36 .",
    "we note the cloud center cools in a time scale of @xmath62 , while the background halo cools in @xmath63 .",
    "we define the cooling length as the distance over which the sound wave of the hot halo gas travels within one cooling time of the perturbed gas , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the sound speed of the hot gas of @xmath57k . the dynamics of radiatively cooling clouds are characterized by the cloud size relative to the cooling length @xcite .    the mass contained within a cloud of radius , @xmath66 , is @xmath67 for @xmath2 , the clouds with the size @xmath68 have the mass scales of @xmath69 that are relevant for pgccs . because of the @xmath70 dependence",
    ", for the background halo density that is much larger or much smaller than our fiducial value , the characteristic cooling mass would be too small or too big , respectively , for the cooled perturbations to become pgccs .",
    "the gasdynamical equations for an axisymmetric system in the cylindrical coordinate system , @xmath71 , including radiative cooling are written as @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 + { \\partial \\over \\partial z } [ u_z ( \\rho e + p ) ] = -\\lambda,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the total energy of the gas per unit mass , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the rest of the variables have their usual meanings .    to solve the hydrodynamic part",
    ", we have used an eulerian , grid - based hydrodynamics code based on the `` total variation diminishing ( tvd ) '' scheme @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical geometry version has been used for 2d simulations . for 1d comparison simulations ,",
    "the spherical geometry version has been used .",
    "the tvd scheme solves a hyperbolic system of gasdynamical conservation equations with a second - order accuracy .",
    "multidimensionality is handled by the strang - type dimensional splitting @xcite .",
    "after completion of the hydrodynamic part updating hydrodynamical quantities from the time step @xmath79 to @xmath80 , radiative cooling is applied to the thermal energy as a separate part . if we were to update the thermal energy density by the following explicit scheme , @xmath81 the time step size should be smaller than the cooling time , that is , @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath83 is estimated from the time averaged hydrodynamic quantities , @xmath84 .",
    "this explicit integration scheme would be extremely expensive , when the cooling time scale is much shorter than the hydrodynamical time scale .",
    "for that reason , we rewrite the cooling part of the thermal energy equation as @xmath85 in our numerical code we integrate this equation as @xmath86 assuming that @xmath35 is constant over the hydrodynamic time scale @xmath87 @xcite . strictly speaking , equation ( 14 )",
    "converges to equation ( 12 ) only when @xmath87 is much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath88 , however , the gas quickly looses most of the thermal energy via radiation and the temperature approaches to the specified minimum value ( @xmath89 ) during one hydrodynamic time step , if we were to integrate equation ( 12 ) with a small timestep size of @xmath35 _ for many steps_. but this behavior is emulated reasonably well by integrating equation ( 14 ) with @xmath87 _ for one step _ , which effectively lowers the gas temperature to @xmath89 .",
    "so the end results of both integration schemes would be qualitively similar , although could be quantitatively somewhat different . especially at different spatial grid resolutions ,",
    "the detail thermal history of the gas could be different during the cooling phase , but once cooled the final structure should be roughly similar . with this integration scheme ,",
    "gas cooling can be followed , although approximately , with the hydrodynamic time steps , even when the cooling time scale is shorter than the hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "our simulations start at @xmath90 with the clouds at rest in pressure equilibrium ( @xmath91 ) , and cease at @xmath92 when the _ background _ gas has cooled to @xmath3k .",
    "the standard mirror condition has been used for the reflecting boundaries at @xmath93 and @xmath94 , while it has been assumed that flows are continuous across the outer boundaries .",
    "we have used only one quadrant of the cylindrical coordinate system .    in our simulations",
    "the clouds cool and collapse due to the compression by the background pressure to the size that is @xmath95 or so of the initial cloud radii . in order to study the detail structure of the collapsed clouds",
    ", we have devised a special grid that consists of an _ inner fine zone _ with uniform grid spacing and an _ outer coarse zone _ with expanding grid spacing .",
    "the inner zone has @xmath96 uniform cells with @xmath97 , where @xmath98 .",
    "the outer zone has @xmath99 cells covering the rest of the simulated region outside the inner fine zone , with the cell spacing that increases outwards as @xmath100 for @xmath101 . with the expanding grid",
    "the outer boundaries are located far away from the central cloud where most activity occurs .",
    "the physical variables are expressed in units of the following normalization both in the numerical code and in the plots presented below : @xmath102 years ; @xmath103kpc ; @xmath104 ; @xmath105 ; @xmath106 .      in order to quantify how the cloud shape evolves",
    ", we define the `` shape parameter '' as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the `` effective '' radii along the @xmath28 and @xmath29-axes , respectively . here",
    ", the `` effective '' radius is defined as the radius where the gas density decreases to a half of the central density , that is , @xmath110 .",
    "the initial values of the shape parameter for models considered are @xmath111 for spherical clouds , @xmath112 and 1/2 for prolate clouds , and @xmath113 and 2 for oblate clouds .",
    "the second column of table 1 shows the initial values of the shape parameter for each model .",
    "we have first calculated spherical symmetric collapses both with 1d and 2d codes , in order to show their behavior and to compare it with that of non - spherical collapses , as well as to test the performance of the 2d code . according to our previous 1d simulations which employed a different code ( the ppm code ) @xcite , the evolution of spherical clouds collapsing via the thermal instability can be classified by the cloud size as follows : 1 ) @xmath114 , the isobaric compression regime , 2 ) @xmath115 , the _ supersonic _ compression regime , and 3 ) @xmath116 , the _ isochoric _ cooling regime .",
    "the following four different sizes have been considered in our spherical symmetric calculations : three _ supersonic _ cloud models , s11 with @xmath117 , m11 with @xmath118 , and l11 with @xmath119 , one _ isochoric _ cloud model , x11 with @xmath120 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the largest cloud model , x11 , has a cloud mass too large for pgccs , but it has been included for comparison .",
    "we first note that the results from the current 1d simulations are consistent with those from our previous simulations in @xcite , although different numerical codes are used .",
    "while the ciem0 cooling model was adopted in @xcite , here we have adopted the standard neqm0 cooling model which has lower peaks around both the h and he ly @xmath121 line emissions ( see figure 1 ) . as a result",
    ", gas cools less rapidly and central density increases to lower values in the current simulations .",
    "the results from 2d simulations of spherical collapses are mostly similar to those from 1d simulations .",
    "figure 2 shows the distributions of the gas density , the velocities in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions and the pressure along the diagonal line of @xmath122 from the 2d simulation for the l11 model with @xmath119 .",
    "the distributions are sampled at @xmath123 ( solid line ) , @xmath124 ( dotted line ) , @xmath125 ( dashed line ) , @xmath126 ( long dashed line ) and @xmath127 ( dot - dashed line ) . as the central gas cools and loses pressure , the high pressure background compresses the cloud and induces an infall flow for @xmath128 .",
    "the flow velocity increases up to @xmath129 , which is much larger than the sound speed of the cooled gas , @xmath130 .",
    "so the accretion flow is supersonic .",
    "after @xmath131 , the infall flow bounces back as an accretion shock and the shock moves out .",
    "then , the cloud expands outward slowly due to the high pressure at the central region .",
    "one can see that the central density increases up to @xmath132 just before the shock bounces back , and then decreases to @xmath133 as the collapsed cloud expands .",
    "the shape of the collapsed clouds from 2d simulations becomes slightly rectangular , especially for the models with small sizes ( see figure 8 below ) .",
    "the deviation from the spherical symmetry , measured with the shape parameter @xmath134 , ranges from less than 1% ( in the x11 model ) to @xmath135% ( in the s11 model ) .      for the non - spherical , axisymmetric clouds ,",
    "four different sizes are considered , as for the spherical clouds : @xmath136 for small clouds , @xmath137 for medium size clouds , @xmath138 for large clouds , and @xmath139 for very large clouds . here , @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "the initial parameters of the model clouds considered are summarized in table 1 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the time evolution of the density distribution of the large prolate cloud , the l56 model with @xmath141 , and the large oblate cloud , the l65 model with @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "figure 5 shows the flow velocity field superimposed on the density contour maps of the l56 ( left panels ) and l65 ( right panels ) models at @xmath143 ( top panels ) and at @xmath144 ( bottom panels ) . as gas cools catastrophically",
    ", the clouds implode near the center and supersonic anisotropic accretion flow is induced .",
    "the compression continues until @xmath145 when infall flow is reflected at the center and an accretion shock forms .",
    "this `` shock formation time '' depends on the initial cloud size , as the infall flow turns around later in larger clouds . at the shock formation time , the infall flow field is strongly anisotropic , preferentially parallel to the @xmath94 plane for the prolate cloud and parallel to the @xmath29-axis for the oblate cloud . as a result ,",
    "the degree of prolateness or oblateness is enhanced .",
    "so the prolate cloud collapses to a very thin rod shape , while the oblate cloud collapses to a flat disk , at @xmath145 in the l56 and l65 models .",
    "the central density peaks at the time of shock formation , and then slowly decreases afterwards . after that time , the accretion shock halts the infall flow , as shown in the bottom panels of figure 5 . inside the accretion shock , there exist residual infall motions with the preferred direction different from that of early accretion before @xmath143 , that is , along the @xmath29-axis for the prolate model and along the @xmath94 plane for the oblate model .",
    "so now the contraction proceeds along the @xmath29-axis toward the center , which in turn generates the radial outflow along the @xmath94 plane inside the cooled cloud in the prolate model . in the oblate model , on the other hand",
    ", the contraction occurs along the @xmath94 plane toward the center and induces the bipolar outflow along the z - axis .",
    "this `` secondary '' contraction leads to a central bulge that has a shape reverse to the initial shape of the cloud .",
    "thus , the prolate cloud results in a structure that consists of a cigar - shaped outer component and a central _ oblate _ component . on the other hand ,",
    "the oblate cloud collapsed to a structure of a pancake - shaped outer component and a central _ prolate _ component .    in the 2d simulation of @xcite , they considered an oblate cloud ( @xmath146 ) with small density contrast , @xmath147 , in a background with @xmath148k and @xmath149 , hotter than ours .",
    "they showed that the cloud collapses to a flat structure with density enhancement of @xmath150 at @xmath151 in units of their cooling time .",
    "because their simulation started with a small @xmath32 , it ended just after the formation of a nonlinear pancake - like structure that corresponds to the structure at @xmath152 in our simulation ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "as a result , they did not see the development of the inner central prolate condensation .",
    "whether collapses end at the cigar / pancake formation stage or they continue to form the inner oblate / prolate components depends mainly on the cloud size ratio , @xmath153 , and the contrast of cooling times , @xmath154 .",
    "thus , these two parameters along the initial shape parameter , @xmath155 , determine the dynamics and mass distribution of the collapsed clouds .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the evolutionary sequences for the medium size prolate cloud , the m12 model with @xmath156 , and the medium size oblate cloud , the m21 model with @xmath157 , respectively . due to a higher degree of initial non - sphericity , these models display much stronger shape instability than the l56 and l65 models .",
    "the shock formation time is @xmath158 , slightly earlier than that for the l56 and l65 models because of smaller sizes .",
    "the inner components due to the secondary contraction grow less significantly , compared to those of the l56 and l65 models .    to illustrate how the initial shape parameter and cloud size affect the evolution , we plot in figure 8 the density contour maps at @xmath159 for the models among listed in table 1 which adopt the standard cooling .",
    "for all models , the regions bounded by @xmath160 \\times [ -0.5 r_{\\rm c , z},0.5 r_{\\rm c , z}]$ ] are shown .",
    "so for example , [ -0.4 , 0.4 ] @xmath161 [ -0.4 , 0.4 ] in units of @xmath7 is shown for the m models .",
    "except in the very large clouds ( the x models ) , the shape reversal is observed in the central part of cooled clouds ; that is , the formation of the inner oblate ( prolate ) component in the prolate ( oblate ) models .",
    "spherical models are shown to demonstrate how well the spherical symmetry is conserved in 2d simulations (  3.1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the collapses of the clouds with initially even 20% deviation from the spherical symmetry ( m56 , m65 , l56 and l65 ) are very different from the spherical collapses . for a given value of @xmath162 , the models with smaller cloud sizes have more significant inner components , since the shock formation occurs earlier . for a given cloud size , on the other hand , the models with @xmath162 s closer to one form more significant inner components . in the very large cloud models ,",
    "the sound crossing time along the long axis ( @xmath163 ) is much longer than the cooling time .",
    "hence , the spherical cloud ( the x11 model ) cools and collapses without forming an accretion shock .",
    "however , the x12 and x21 models have the minor - axis radius , @xmath164 , so they are able to collapse supersonically along the minor - axis forming an accretion shock at @xmath165 . as a result , by @xmath166 the prolate cloud ( the x12 model )",
    "has been developed into a rod with the central density @xmath167 , while the oblate cloud ( the x21 model ) into a pancake with @xmath168 .",
    "as in the simulation by @xcite , the inner central components do not display the shape reversal by the time @xmath169 in these models .",
    "if we adopt a higher initial density contrast or keep the background gas at constant pressure , however , even the x models could have developed the inner central components with the reversed shape .    in order to look at the density enhancement in a quantitative way",
    ", we present in figure 9 the density line profiles of the collapsed clouds at @xmath170 for the initially prolate ( left panels ) and oblate ( right panels ) clouds .",
    "the dotted ( dashed ) lines show the profiles along the @xmath28-axis ( @xmath29-axis ) , while the solid lines show the profiles of the 2d spherical models with the same size ( the s11-x11 models ) along the diagonal line of @xmath171 as a function of the radial distance @xmath172 . in the prolate models",
    "the dashed lines reveal the thin rod - shape component along the @xmath29-axis , while the dotted lines show the inner oblate component along the @xmath28-axis , except in the x12 model where the inner oblate component does form . in the oblate models ,",
    "on the other hand , the dotted lines show the flat pancake - shape component along the @xmath28-axis , while the dashed lines reveal the inner prolate component along the @xmath29-axis , except in the x21 model .",
    "once again the shape reversal is observed in the central region ( @xmath173 ) of the cooled clouds , except in the x models .",
    "the outer rod - shape component in the prolate models and the outer pancake - shape component in the oblate models have the density close to the isobaric ratio , @xmath174 .",
    "the inner oblate / prolate components have the mean density somewhat higher ( @xmath175 ) in the m and l models .",
    "as mentioned before , the central density peaks at the time of shock formation and then decreases afterwards as the clouds expand , so the density distribution changes in time . if we compare the central density of different models at a given time after the inner shape reversal appears , the oblate models have higher values than the prolate models , except in the x models .",
    "figure 10 shows the evolution of the shape parameter , @xmath176 , for the models with @xmath156 ( prolate ) and 2 ( oblate ) . during the first `` shape instability '' stage ,",
    "the shape parameter is determined by the cigar - shape component or the pancake - shape component . during the `` secondary infall ''",
    "stage after the shock formation , however , it represents the shape of the inner components in most models ( except in the s12 model ) . in the oblate clouds ( right panels ) , as the clouds collapse to flat pancakes , the value of @xmath176 increases to @xmath177 until the shock formation time .",
    "such time when @xmath176 reaches the maximum values scales as the sound crossing time ( @xmath178 ) , which is proportional to the cloud size .",

    "rees model for the formation of pgccs where the thermal instability is assumed to proceed quasi - statically , the `` critical mass '' defined for an isothermal sphere confined by an external pressure @xcite @xmath185 was adopted as the minimum mass for gravitationally unstable clouds , for @xmath186 and @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "however , this simple picture should be modified for the following reasons : 1 ) the collapse is not quasi - static and the infall flows can become supersonic , so the compressed clouds are bound by the ram pressure of the infall flows rather than the background pressure , 2 ) the cooled compressed clouds ( pgccs ) may have turbulent velocity fields ( see figure 5 ) , 3 ) the mass distribution of pgccs can be very complex , rather than spherical ( see figures 3 - 8 ) .    as an effort to obtain a better estimation on the pgcc mass",
    ", we have estimated the jeans mass of the cooled gas in our simulations as follows .",
    "first , we have calculated the mass of the gas with @xmath38k , @xmath189 .",
    "the right panels of figure 11 show how @xmath189 increases with time in our models .",
    "most of the cloud gas cools to @xmath3k by @xmath190 , so by this time @xmath189 becomes comparable to the initial cloud mass , @xmath191 .",
    "we present the values of @xmath189 at @xmath190 in the fifth column of table 1 .",
    "next , from the mass and volume of the cells with @xmath192k , we have calculated the mean density of the central region , @xmath193 .",
    "the values of @xmath193 are shown in the left panels of figure 11 .",
    "although the central density can increase to values much higher than the isobaric compression ratio of @xmath194 , the mean density , @xmath195 , increases only up to that ratio and then decreases , as the background gas cools and the cooled cloud expands .",
    "the values of @xmath193 at @xmath190 are listed in the last column of table 1 .    finally ,",
    "although it may not be a good approximation either because of the reasons listed above , we have computed the jeans mass of an isothermal uniform sphere with temperature @xmath196 and density @xmath197 as @xcite @xmath198 by adopting @xmath199k and @xmath200 .",
    "the values of such jean masses are plotted in the right panels of figure 11 , and listed in the 8th column in table 1 . in the spherical model ,",
    "the cooled gas in the l11 cloud has mass greater than the jeans mass , @xmath201 . in the non - spherical models , the total mass of the cooled gas in the l56 , l65 , and l21 clouds exceeds the jeans mass .",
    "these clouds might become gravitationally unstable after cooling to @xmath3k . in those models , the clouds might imprint the jeans mass of @xmath202 . assuming a star formation efficiency of order 10 % ,",
    "this mass estimate is a bit too large for the characteristic mass scale of the gc mass distribution .",
    "this mass scale , however , is much larger than the previously estimation by @xcite .",
    "it is because the cloud density increases only to @xmath203 in the current simulations where the slower nonequilibrium cooling rate has been adopted . in any case",
    ", our estimation for the gravitationally unstable mass scale should be taken to be very rough , and would depend on the model parameters including the density and temperature of the background .",
    "in addition , self - gravity has been ignored in our simulations , which is expected to be important in the later stage of the cloud evolution , as pointed in  1 .",
    "because the x11 , x12 and x21 models either have small density enhancement or have extremely non - spherical mass distribution , we argue that it would not be useful to make the comparison between @xmath189 and @xmath204 for those models .",
    "finally , we have calculated the l56 and l65 models with different coolings , to see their effects .",
    "they are labeled as el56 and el65 for the models with the ciem0 cooling and as ml56 and ml65 for the models with the neqm1 cooling ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "figure 12 shows the density contour maps at the shock formation time ( @xmath143 ) and at a later time ( @xmath205 ) . in the ml56 and ml65 models where cooling is enhanced by about a factor of 3.5 at @xmath206k due to metals ,",
    "the cloud gas has cooled to @xmath38 k already at @xmath207 and the compression wave steepens into a pair of shocks ( reverse and forward ) by @xmath208 .",
    "this produces an elongated ring - like structure in the 2d image , which is in fact a dense elongated shell in 3d .",
    "this structure along with the pair of shocks collapses at the center and then an accretion shock bounces back before @xmath209 .",
    "the gas of the el56 and el65 models with the ciem0 cooling cools faster , and so we see the resulting structure is more compact than that in the models with the standard neqm0 cooling . as a result",
    ", the density enhancement reaches @xmath210 by @xmath205 , which are greater than those found in the models with the standard cooling .",
    "so the spherical jeans mass of the cooled clouds becomes @xmath211 , which is more consistent with the characteristic mass scale of gcs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in many astrophysical problems , a two - phase medium may develop by the formation of cold dense clouds via the thermal instability . in order to explore",
    "how the non - spherical shape affects the collapse of thermally unstable clouds , we have performed 2d hydrodynamical simulations in the cylindrical geometry with the radiative cooling rate for a primordial gas . although we have selected for our simulations a physical environment relevant to a protogalactic halo ,",
    "the overall simulation results can be applied to the collapse of thermally unstable clouds of any physical scales , as long as the cooling curve has the pertinent characteristics for the thermal instability .",
    "the collapse of non - spherical clouds depends mainly on the following factors.1 ) the ratio of the cloud size to the cooling length , @xmath153 : as shown in the previous 1d spherical simulations @xcite , clouds of @xmath21 undergo a supersonic compression , resulting in high density enhancements .",
    "small clouds with @xmath212 cool nearly isobarically through a quasi - static compression , while large clouds with @xmath213 cool nearly isochorically .",
    "hence , we have focused on the clouds with @xmath21.2 ) the initial density contrast between the cloud and the background , @xmath214 : note that the contrast in cooling times , @xmath154 , is initially proportional to @xmath215 for an isobaric perturbation . since we have not included any heating source that maintains the temperature of the background gas , the growth of nonlinear structures depends on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "for example , with @xmath33 , only the first stage of nonlinear growth can develop before the background gas itself cools down . with @xmath216 , however , more complex structures form after the initial emergence of the shape instabilities .",
    "so we have started our simulations with @xmath217.3 ) the degree of non - sphericity , @xmath218 : it is obvious that the degree of deviation from the spherical symmetry determines the dynamics of the infall flows and the mass distribution of the collapsed clouds .",
    "so we have considered both the prolate clouds with @xmath219 and 5/6 and the oblate clouds with @xmath142 and 2 , in addition to the spherical clouds ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "the collapse in our simulations can be described by two distinct stages : the first _ shape instability stage _ during which the non - sphericity grows due to the initial infall , and the _ secondary contraction stage _ during which the infall occurs predominantly along the direction perpendicular to the initial infall flows and a `` shape reversal '' occurs .",
    "even with initially only 20 % deviation from the spherical shape ( @xmath141 or 6/5 ) , a strong shape instability occurs , so the prolate clouds are compressed to thin rods and the oblate clouds are compressed to flat pancakes due to strongly anisotropic infall flows .",
    "the degree of prolateness or oblateness , however , is enhanced only during the initial shape instability phase up to the formation of accretion shocks . afterwards , secondary infall motions are induced , dominantly along the @xmath29-axis for the prolate clouds and along the @xmath94 plane for the oblate clouds .",
    "this secondary contraction parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath29-axis induces , within the cooled clouds , the radial outflows in the prolate models or the bipolar outflows in the oblate models , resulting in the inner central bulges with the mass distribution opposite to the initial shape . as a result , initially prolate clouds collapse to a system that consists of an outer cigar - shaped component and a central oblate component , while initially oblate clouds collapse to a system that consists of an outer pancake - shaped component and a central prolate component .",
    "the central density of the collapsed clouds increases until accretion shocks form at the end of the first shape instability stage .",
    "and then it gradually decreases as the clouds expand , since the central pressure is higher than the background pressure .",
    "the central density in our simulations has turned out to be much lower than that in the previous simulations . in the secondary contraction stage ,",
    "the mean density of the outer pancake or thin - rod components is similar to the background density times the isobaric compression ratio of @xmath221 , while that of the inner components reaches only up to an order of magnitude higher than that .",
    "we note that the density enhancement depends on the radiative cooling rate",
    ". it would be higher in the simulations with larger cooling rates .",
    "we have adopted as the standard cooling model , the cooling rate of a primordial gas based on the non - equilibrium ionization fraction tabulated by @xcite .",
    "this cooling model has lower rates near h and he ly @xmath121 line emission peaks than the cooling model based on the collisional ionization equilibrium which was adopted in our previous 1d simulations @xcite .",
    "so we have found smaller density enhancements in the current simulations .    for the protogalactic halo environment considered here ,",
    "@xmath222 and @xmath57k , the spherical jeans mass of the cooled clouds is about @xmath223 .",
    "this mass scale is somewhat large for the mass of pgccs which fragment to form gcs .",
    "but this is based on a very rough estimation which would depend on model parameters .",
    "in addition , in a realistic halo environment , the halo gas may be heated by the stellar winds , supernova explosions , shock waves and etc .",
    "if the halo can maintain the high temperature and continue to compressed the pgccs , the density of pgccs would have increased more , resulting in a smaller jeans mass .",
    "finally , we have considered here a static halo of uniform density .",
    "however , protogalactic halos are likely clumpy and turbulent , and the pgccs may have formed in such environment .",
    "we leave all these issues , along with extension into 3d , to future works .",
