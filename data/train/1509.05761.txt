    "when a single crystal beam is plastically bent , excess dislocations occur on certain active slip planes to reduce its energy . as a rule",
    ", the number of dislocations is huge , so , instead of a difficult task of describing individual dislocations , the use of continuum approach to find the dislocation densities in the bent state turns out more effective .",
    "the first attempt of taking into account continuously distributed excess dislocations in the plastically bent beam was made by @xcite who expressed the curvature of the beam caused by dislocations in terms of the dislocation density tensor bearing now his name . @xcite and @xcite have extended this result to the case when the stress due to excess dislocations does not vanish ( see also @xcite ) . unfortunately , because of the lack of physically sound continuum dislocation theories , no quantitative dislocation distribution could be predicted in terms of the bending moment .",
    "the first quantitative prediction of the dislocation density of single crystal beam bent in single slip has been made in @xcite .",
    "the analyzed model was based on the continuum dislocation theory proposed by @xcite and developed further in @xcite ( see also the alternative approaches in @xcite ) .",
    "the information about dislocation distribution obtained in @xcite has been used to explain the formation of small angle tilt boundaries and predict the number of polygons in a polygonized beam after annealing ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the real bending of single crystal beam is often more involved because two or more slip systems could be activated during the plastic bending , depending on the orientation of crystal with respect to the beam axis affecting the schmid factors .",
    "for instance , if the fcc single crystal beam having the axis parallel to @xmath0$]-direction is bent about the @xmath1 $ ] direction , then there are two symmetric active slip systems oriented at angles @xmath2 with respect to the beam axis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . simulations of such bending problems require more elaborate models because of the interaction between edge dislocations of different groups .",
    "this paper aims at constructing an approximate one - dimensional theory of bending of single crystal beams having two active slip systems and , thus , extending the results obtained in @xcite to double slip .",
    "we incorporate the interactions of excess dislocations in a material model similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "we then use the variational - asymptotic method developed in @xcite to derive the one - dimensional approximate theories from the exact three - dimensional problems in two cases : ( i ) the resistance to dislocation motion is negligibly small so that the displacements and plastic slips can be found by minimizing the energy functional , ( ii ) the rate - independent dissipation is taken into account .",
    "the obtained one - dimensional variational problems admit analytical solutions representing the smooth minimizers for the symmetric active slip systems .",
    "it is established that there exist energetic as well as dissipative thresholds for the dislocation nucleation which depend on the thickness of the beam .",
    "this exhibits the typical size effect of the gradient theory .",
    "based on this analytical solution the deflection of the beam , the dislocation density , and the moment - curvature curve are analyzed in terms of the bending moment for different loading / unloading processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the 3-d models of single crystal beam with continuously distributed dislocations bent in double slip are formulated .",
    "sections 3 and 4 derive the one - dimensional equations and solve them for the case of zero dissipation .",
    "sections 5 and 6 consider the same problems but with dissipation .",
    "finally , section 7 concludes the paper .",
    ".,width=415 ]    consider a single crystal beam bent by a moment @xmath3 . in the undeformed state the beam occupies",
    "the domain @xmath4 of the three - dimensional euclidean space , with the cartesian coordinates @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the length , height , and width of the beam , respectively .",
    "we will assume that @xmath9 and that the beam is bent under the plane strain condition . for definiteness ,",
    "let the beam be clamped at @xmath10 and subjected to a linearly distributed traction @xmath11 having the resultant moment @xmath3 at @xmath12 . besides , the upper and lower boundaries of the beam at @xmath13 and @xmath14 are traction free .",
    "if the applied moment is small , it is natural to expect that the beam deforms elastically and the stress distribution is linear over the thickness according to the elementary beam theory .",
    "however , if the applied moment exceeds some critical value , edge dislocations with dislocation lines parallel to the @xmath15-axis may appear to reduce energy of the bent beam .",
    "we assume that , at the onset of yielding and during the plastic deformations , the crystal admits two active slip systems with slip planes inclined at angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 to the plane @xmath18 as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .    under the plane strain state condition",
    "there are only two non - zero components of the displacements that do not depend on @xmath15 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the non - zero components of the total strain tensor are @xmath21 throughout the paper the comma before an index is used to denote the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate . since there are two active slip systems , the plastic distortion tensor is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the unit vectors denoting the slip direction and the normal to the slip planes of the corresponding slip system .",
    "we call @xmath27 and @xmath28 the plastic slips .",
    "thus , the finding of plastic distortion tensor reduces to determining the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "these give two scalar dislocation densities @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the magnitude of the burgers vector .",
    "let us propose the free energy density of the single crystal deforming in double slip in the form ( see @xcite ) @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the lam constants , @xmath42 the saturated dislocation density , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 the constants of the material .",
    "the first two terms in represent the contribution to the energy of crystal by the elastic strain .",
    "the third and fourth terms are the contributions to the energy from the two separate groups of excess dislocations @xcite .",
    "finally , the last term takes the interaction of dislocations between these two groups into account . for small up to moderate dislocation densities",
    "the logarithmic terms can be approximated by the taylor series as follows @xmath45 we shall use further only this approximation .    with and the total energy functional of the bent beam becomes @xmath46 dxdy   \\\\",

    "thus , the whole process of dislocation nucleation and dislocation dynamics can not be described by this theory .",
    "the bending moment @xmath52 is regarded as a control parameter , so one can study the evolution of the dislocation network in terms of @xmath3 .",

    "we shall consider the simplest rate - independent theory for which @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the critical resolved shear stress .",

[ fig:4 ] , where the dimensionless dislocation density @xmath197 is plotted for @xmath194 and for two different angles , it is seen that the excess edge dislocations of the same sign of each group are concentrated in the middle of the beam thickness , with maximum dislocation density achieved at @xmath198 .",
    "although no obstacle exists on the middle line , the repulsive forces between dislocations of the same sign prevent them from colliding .",
    "thus , the high concentration of dislocations can be regarded as the dislocation pile - up against the middle line .",

    "[ fig:10 ] for @xmath180 and ( a ) @xmath273 ( b ) @xmath182 .",
    "since the curvature of the beam is constant , the thickness of the dislocation zone @xmath130 does not depend on @xmath136 .    on fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] we show the moment - curvature curve for @xmath202 and @xmath182 , respectively .",
    "up to the threshold moment @xmath274 ( corresponding to point a on this figure ) the moment - curvature curve is a straight line corresponding to the linear elastic beam theory . then the curve becomes non - linear and , in contrast to the zero dissipation case , also non - monotone as @xmath142 increases as can be seen in curve ( b ) . at the onset of the plastic yielding we can observe a small softening behavior of the moment - curvature curve .",
    "the further monotonously increasing portion of the moment - curvature curve describes the work hardening due to the dislocation pile - up against the middle line of the beam .",
    "if the bending moment is increased from zero up to the moment @xmath204 corresponding to b ( the loading case ) we follow the moment - curvature curve from o through a to b ( with a possible jump in @xmath142 to pass the softening portion ) .",
    "if the beam is then unloaded , the moment - curvature curve becomes a straight line bc with the same slope like that of oa as shown in fig .",

    "in this paper the one - dimensional theory of bending of a single crystal beam with two active slip systems has been developed .",
    "the one - dimensional energy of bending can be found after the solution of the thickness problem .",
    "the latter has been solved for the symmetric slip systems .",
    "the threshold bending moment exhibiting the size effect has been found for the case without and with dissipation .",
    "we have found also the dislocation density and the moment - curvature curves at loading and unloading .",
    "it would be interesting to verify the obtained results with the measurement of excess dislocation density in a bent beam by the method of orientation imaging microscopy developed recently in @xcite .",
    "the specimen could be for instance the fcc single crystal beam having the axis parallel to @xmath0$]-direction and bent about the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
