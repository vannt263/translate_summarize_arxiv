    "cataclysmic variable stars are close binary systems containing white dwarf ( the primary ) and red dwarf ( the secondary ) . in those systems",
    "the secondary loses its mass through the inner lagrangian point in the roche - lobe and the primary star accretes it ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "su uma class of dwarf novae is one of the subclasses of cataclysmic variable stars .",
    "su uma - type stars show two types of outbursts : short ( outbursts ) and long ( superoutbursts ) .",
    "superoutbursts are about one magnitude brighter than ordinary outbursts and have a duration a few days longer than the outbursts . in the light curves of superoutbursts",
    "one can see periodic light oscillations ( superhumps ) with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "the thermal - tidal instability model proposed by osaki ( 1996 ) is now known as the best explanation of the mechanism of the superoutbursts and superhumps ( for a review see warner 1995 , osaki 1996 , hellier 2001 ) . however , in recent years some serious criticism concerning both the nature of superoutburst and nature of superhumps has appeared ( schreiber and lasota 2007 , smak 2004 , 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "v1113 cyg was discovered as a dwarf nova by hoffmeister ( 1966 ) , but received little attention for almost 30 years .",
    "results of kato et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that the star is su uma - type with superhumps period of @xmath3 d. they also reported that v1113 cyg has a large ( @xmath4 6 mag ) superoutburst amplitude .    in the second paper by kato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the detection of 30 outburst from july 1994 to may 2001 is presented .",
    "they noticed low number of outbursts ( only about two normal outbursts per each supercycle ) and high number of superoutbursts ( 12 from 30 detected ) .",
    "they suspected variation of the mass transfer rate .",
    "because results are inconclusive further observations were needed .",
    "kato et al . ( 2009 ) reanalyzed the observations of kato et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and obtained new observations during the 2008 superoutburst .",
    "they reported decreasing superhump periods in both superoutburts with the rates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "observations of the v1113 cyg were made during 34 nights ( 11 nights between may 5 and august 28 in 2003 and 23 nights between january 17 and june 30 in 2005 ) .",
    "all data were collected at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory . v1113",
    "cyg was observed by 60-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back - illuminated ccd camera .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76\" / pixel providing a 6.5@xmath76.5 field of view .",
    "the full description of the telescope and camera was given by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) .",
    "we monitored the star in `` white light '' to have possibility of making reliable photometry in quiescence and to minimize guiding errors .",
    "the exposure times varied from 19 to 400 seconds depending on the sky transparency , seeing and brightness of the object .    in table 1 we present a full journal of our ccd observations of v1113 cyg .",
    "the star was monitored during 48.71 hours .",
    "we obtained 1436 useful exposures .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of v1113 cygni .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     the least squares linear fit to the data from table 2 gives the following ephemeris for the maxima :    @xmath8    the @xmath9 values corresponding to the ephemeris ( 1 ) are shown in fig .",
    "5 and listed in table 2 .",
    "it seems that the superhump period shows a decreasing trend .",
    "this fact was confirmed by the second - order polynomial fit to the moment of maxima .",
    "the following ephemeris were estimated :    @xmath10    the solid line in the fig .",
    "5 corresponds to the ephemeris ( 2 ) .",
    "finally , we conclude that the period of the superhumps was not stable during the may 2003 superoutburst of the variable ; it can be described by a decreasing trend with a rate of @xmath11 . combining both of our superhump period determinations returned its mean value which is equal to @xmath0 days ( @xmath1 min ) .",
    "recently , kato et al . ( 2009 ) published a comprehensive survey of period variations of superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the conlcuded that in many systems evolution of the superhump period can be divided into three distinct parts : an early stage with a stable and longer period ( stage a ) , middle stage for which many systems ( especially with @xmath12 days ) show positive superhump period derivative ( stage b ) and final stage with a shorter but again stable superhump period ( stage c ) .",
    "however they reported that v1113 cyg does not follow this scenario with decreasing superhump periods with the rates of @xmath13 and @xmath6 observed for 1994 and 2008 superoutbursts , respectively .",
    "v1113 cyg has its superhump period close to 0.08 day borderline and thus can show different superhump period evolution .",
    "our high negative @xmath14 value may indicate that the behaviour of the star is similar to that observed in su uma or dm dra ( see figs . 4 and 7 in kato",
    "et al . 2009 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", it is also possible that in 2003 our observations caught v1113 cyg during the transition from stage a to b. as can be estimated from fig . 4 of kato et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for stars with superhump period of around 0.078 days , such a transition occurs around cycle number @xmath15 assuming @xmath16 for the begining of the superoutburst ( see @xmath9 diagrams of tt boo , qy per , rz leo or eg aqr ) .",
    "the peak of the parabola shown in our fig .",
    "5 occurs also at @xmath17 but in this case the cycle numeration starts with the first night of the observations which is not the first night of the superoutburst . assuming that the superoutburst started 1 - 2 days before our first observation the transition moment shifts to @xmath18 or even @xmath19 .",
    "it is quite late in comparison to other stars putting some doubt in a to b transition hypothesis .",
    "* detection of the clear superhumps during those events directly proves that v1113 cyg belongs to the group of su uma variables .",
    "* the amplitude of the superoutburst is at least ( @xmath4 4 ) mag , but we never caught the star at the beginning of the superoutburst . according to kato ( 2001 )",
    "this variable has a large ( @xmath4 6 ) mag outburst amplitude and it is a possible estimation .",
    "* during two years of observation the star went into at least two superoutbursts so v1113 cyg has about one superoutburst a year .",
    "eruptions of the star lasted about two weeks and were not shorter than 12 days ( july 2005 superoutburst ) .",
    "* we did not record any normal outbursts .",
    "lack of them may be an observational effect .",
    "but in general we agree with the results of kato ( 2001 ) which suggest low ratio of outbursts to superoutbursts . * during the first observed superoutburst the superhump period was decreasing with an enormous rate of @xmath2 which is one of the highest values ever observed in su uma systems .    *",
