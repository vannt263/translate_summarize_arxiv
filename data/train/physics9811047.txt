    "collision  broadened spectral line shapes carry important information on the time - dependent dynamical and collisional processes occurring in a radiating medium . for a system consisting of radiators ( light emitting or absorbing species ) and perturbers ( atoms , molecules , ions or electrons ) ,",
    "the basic ingredient in spectral line shape theory is the fourier transform of the time autocorrelation function of the radiator dipole .",
    "the physical processes here involve the dynamical evolution of the radiator as it undergoes multiple collisions with a large number of perturbers .",
    "the interaction between the time dependent radiator dipole moment and the electromagnetic field induces absorption and emission . in this paper",
    "we develop a phase space based representation of quantum mechanics that is suitable for determining this dynamics . within this formalism",
    "there are two different semiclassical approximations .",
    "these are employed in tandem to obtain representations of the autocorrelation function that are sufficiently simple to allow numerical calculation .",
    "the method developed here is suggested by the moyal description@xcite of quantum mechanics , which is based on the wigner ",
    "weyl isomorphism@xcite between hilbert space operators and functions ( weyl symbols ) on classical phase space . in this",
    "isomorphism@xcite the canonical @xmath3 operators are transformed into linear phase space functions @xmath4 .",
    "the line shape problem presents one with two distinguished degrees of freedom : the internal molecular coordinates and the relative radiator  perturber separation variables . in many circumstances ( large mass , large impact parameter , high relative velocity , weak pairwise interaction ) one expects the relative motion to be nearly classical . on the other hand , evolutions of the subsystems associated with the internal coordinates",
    "are , generally , far from classical .",
    "this circumstance is exploited by the introduction of a partial wigner transform that converts the relative motion degrees of freedom into phase space variables , but keeps operators associated with the internal coordinates in their original hilbert space form .",
    "the result of this transformation we call a mixed weyl symbol .",
    "our approach to a quantum line shape theory is strongly influenced by the well established ` classical path approximation ' , which is used in many areas of atomic and molecular physics .",
    "it assumes that the perturbers move as classical particles , that is , along definite paths determined by the radiator ",
    "perturber interaction .",
    "the traditional justification for this approximation arises from the notion that one may consider the motion of perturbers in terms of packets of translational wave functions , following the laws of classical mechanics .",
    "anderson@xcite in setting up his pioneering line shape theory argued , that since the typical distances of closest approach are about 5 , an uncertainty in position of 1 leads to no great ambiguity in the magnitude or the type of intermolecular forces involved in the collision .",
    "he invoked the uncertainty principle to conclude that the corresponding uncertainty in velocity is only a few percent for most molecular pairs .",
    "the approximation evidently breaks down @xcite when the de broglie wavelength of the perturber is comparable to or larger than a characteristic distance over which the intermolecular potential varies appreciably .",
    "an alternative way @xcite of expressing this condition is that for the profile to be adequately treated with a classical path , the collisions of significance must have large angular momentum . such a condition is reminiscent of that required to calculate scattering cross sections classically@xcite .",
    "early derivations of the approximation employed heuristic arguments which relied on physical insight .",
    "the subsequent work of baranger@xcite and smith _ et al _ @xcite unified the derivation of the classical path approximation , and in particular employed statistical mechanics to justify the representation of the correlation function as an integral over the phase space variables of the perturber . the phase space average procedure @xcite remains a cornerstone of the theory to the present .",
    "the system we shall consider is a dilute gas in which each of the radiator and perturber subsystems is in equilibrium and in which the binary collision approximation is valid .",
    "the binary collision approximation , which implies that strong collisions between radiator and perturber are well - separated in time , is a central assumption @xcite in most line broadening theories .",
    "the radiator density is sufficiently low that the radiator ",
    "radiator interaction may be ignored .",
    "the linewidth is dominated by collision broadening effects ; doppler and lifetime broadening are omitted from the analysis .",
    "the heavy radiator approximation is thereby imposed .",
    "the radiator and perturber subsystems are statistically independent ; that is , the state of the perturber does not depend explicitly on the state of the radiator and vice versa .",
    "this assumption is frequently termed the ` lack of back reaction ' in the density matrix .",
    "consequently the density matrix may be factored as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend only on the radiator and perturber variables , respectively @xcite .",
    "finally , since interest lies primarily in the effect of the field ",
    "radiator interaction on the radiator , the electromagnetic field is treated classically . for an overview of collision  broadening ,",
    "the reader is referred to the review @xcite of allard and kielkopf .",
    "a traditional starting point for the development of line shape theory is the expression for the power gained or lost from the radiation field to the molecular many body system in making electric dipole transitions from all initial states @xmath8 to all possible final states @xmath9 .",
    "the power produced by a single radiator interacting with the perturbers , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fermi golden rule probability per unit time for a transition between states @xmath8 and @xmath9 having an energy difference @xmath12 .",

    "the frequency content of this expression is known as the line shape or spectral profile , @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is the @xmath16-perturber dipole - dipole autocorrelation function , the spectral profile is the fourier integral @xmath17 throughout the paper we employ the version of the binary collision approximation @xcite , which expresses @xmath15 via the one perturber autocorrelation function @xmath18 , ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , namely @xmath19 .    in this",
    "setting , the hamiltonian required in the one perturber autocorrelation function is a sum of three contributions @xmath20 the hamiltonian @xmath21 determines the ( radiator ) molecular structure , and the pair of hamiltonians @xmath22 generate different parts of the radiator  perturber dynamics . let the @xmath23 dimensional internal radiator coordinates be the cartesian variables @xmath24 and the radiator ",

    "the full system hilbert space is @xmath28 . for reasons of clarity of presentation and notational convenience , we assume that the perturber may be treated as a point particle .",

    "the subsequent corrections arise from the noncommutative nature of the @xmath214 product for the mixed symbol .    the simplifications that result from the finite state coupling approximation 1 ) and the semiclassical expansions 2 ) and 3 ) , give equations of motion that are suitable for numerical solution .",
    "to order @xmath411 the equations ( [ eq4.6 ] ) and ( 4.9 ) are no more elaborate than those previously used to numerically compute the atom  atom collision problem within the moyal formalism , @xcite .",
    "the first term of ( [ eq4.9 ] ) is entirely equivalent to the dipole autocorrelation function written in the classical path approximation and thus contains the same information as , for example , equation @xmath468 in griem s treatise @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that ( [ eq4.9 ] ) gives the first two terms of a completely quantum mechanical expression for @xmath18 .",
    "the established success of the classical path approximation in accounting for observed line shapes means that the @xmath362 version of the theory has much of the correct physics built into it .    for heavy perturbers",
    "the classical path approximation works well . the diatomic molecular radiator ",
    "atomic perturber case has received much attention ; for example , hcl  ar collisions were studied by nielsen and gordon @xcite .",
    "more recently , looney and herman @xcite made a comparison of comprehensive calculations of the @xmath469broadened rotational lines in the fundamental band of hcl with state - of - the - art experimental data @xcite and found excellent agreement .",
    "evidence that the @xmath411 correction may be sufficient in many cases for an accurate quantum mechanical treatment comes from the work of smith , giraud and cooper @xcite on co  he .",
    "their classical path calculations for this light perturber system agreed with close  coupling calculations to within 10% .",
    "transforming the general autocorrelation function in ( [ eq4.9 ] ) through ( [ eq1.0 ] ) to give the profile @xmath14 can be difficult .",
    "the line shape problem has two frequently employed limits , the impact approximation which applies to line centers and the quasi  static approximation which describes the far spectral wings @xcite .",
    "various unified theories have been devised to connect these two regimes .",
    "similar strategies will have to be applied to ( [ eq4.9 ] ) and ( [ eq1.0 ] ) in order to compute actual profiles accurately .",
    "the mixed symbol method of computing @xmath18 has an important flexibility .",
    "the total isotropic intermolecular interaction energy is @xmath470 , the central potential can be arbitrarily divided between @xmath471 and @xmath472 .",
    "it is customary , in the classical path approximation , to set @xmath473 .",
    "this means that the trajectories generated by @xmath474 are consistent with the full central potential .",
    "however , one can make other choices . if @xmath475 , then @xmath476 ( kinetic energy ) and the classical trajectories are constant velocity straight lines . here",
    "all the isotropic potential resides in @xmath472 .",
    "for @xmath477 evolution , the @xmath362 formula ( 4.5 ) in 2 ) is exact , namely @xmath478 . in this circumstance",
    "all the semiclassical behavior comes from approximation 3 ) .",
    "this approach would improve upon the usual straight line trajectory technique often used to treat the broadening of atomic lines by ionic perturbers @xcite .",
    "another appealing option is to place all the attractive part of the intermolecular interaction in @xmath472 . now @xmath471 will be purely repulsive and for this reason the @xmath96 flow will not have any unstable fixed points . in this way",
    "the unstable fixed point long time breakdown@xcite of the standard semiclassical approximation is avoided .",
    "we have introduced the mixed weyl symbol formalism in order to obtain a new and computationally viable full quantum version of line shape theory .",
    "however the mixed symbol representation is also applicable to any composite system having distinct quantum and semiclassical degrees of freedom .",
    "the scattering of spin dependent particles and the coulomb excitation of an atom or a nucleus are additional examples of such systems .",
    "the authors would like to thank f. h. molzahn for critically reading the manuscript .",
    "this research was supported in part by grants to tao and gct from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "mfk wishes to thank the university of manitoba for a post - doctoral fellowship .",
    "the theory of pseudodifferential operators @xcite provides an analysis of the @xmath214 product and its associated derivative expansions . for @xmath183-valued symbols",
    "@xmath479 on @xmath90 the @xmath214 product is defined by the scalar analog of ( [ eq2.9b ] ) , namely @xmath480\\ , .\\ ] ] in the rigorous approach there are two important questions : a ) the convergence of the integral ( [ eqa1 ] ) and the status of the groenewold series ( 2.8 ) as an asymptotic expansion of @xmath481 ; b ) the properties of the operator corresponding to a given symbol , in particular the symbol which is the result of the @xmath214 product and its approximations .",
    "the answer to these questions is effected by restricting the symbols to special classes of functions .",
    "a standard and important example is the class @xmath482 .",
    "take @xmath483 to be dimensionless versions of @xmath484 , and denote by @xmath482 a set of @xmath485 functions with estimate @xmath486 valid for all multi - indices @xmath487 , @xmath488 and some constant @xmath489 , uniformly for @xmath490 .",
    "then the following statements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ( 2.49 ) ) hold : 1 ) the map @xmath491 is continuous from @xmath492 .",
    "2 ) for @xmath493 and @xmath494 , the remainder @xmath495 in the groenewold series belongs to the class @xmath496 and so the expansion ( [ eq2.g1a ] ) becomes asymptotic .",
    "in other words , @xmath497 and the error term vanishes as either @xmath498 while @xmath499 , or as @xmath500 while @xmath501 . in this sense",
