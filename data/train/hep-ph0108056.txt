    "it is quite possible that the standard model ( sm ) , is not the ultimate theory of nature , as is hinted by a number of theoretical shortcomings .",
    "one of the most popular choices for physics beyond sm is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental requirement that susy must be a broken symmetry introduces a plethora of new soft breaking parameters .",
    "there are important constraints on this large parameter space from the negative results of the sparticle searches at colliders like lep@xcite and tevatron@xcite .",
    "in addition there are important theoretical constraints which are often introduced for aesthetic reasons . from practical point of view , however , the most important effect of such constraints is to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "for example , the assumption that the soft breaking terms arise as a result of gravitational interactions leads to the popular minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model with five free parameters only , defined at a high energy scale where susy is broken .",
    "they are the common scalar mass ( @xmath10 ) , the common gaugino mass ( @xmath8 ) , the common trilinear coupling ( @xmath3 ) , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of two higgs field ( @xmath11 ) and the sign of @xmath9 , the higgsino mass parameter . in this paper",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to variations of this basic framework .",
    "a very useful way to further constrain the allowed parameter space ( aps ) of softly broken susy models is to consider the dangerous directions of the scalar potential , where the potential may be unbounded from below ( ufb ) or develop a charge and/or color breaking ( ccb ) minima @xcite .",
    "different directions are chosen by giving vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to one or more coloured and / or charged scalar fields , while the vevs of the other scalars are taken to be zero .    in a very interesting paper which revived interest in ufb and ccb constraints , casas _",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the effects of such constraints on susy models . though their formulae are fairly model - independent , they had carried out the numerical analysis within the framework of msugra for moderate values of @xmath11 only , when one can ignore the effects of b and @xmath12 yukawa couplings in the relevant renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "their main result was that a certain ufb constraint known as ufb3 with vevs given in the direction of the slepton fields puts the tightest bound on the susy parameter space that they considered ( see eq .",
    "( 93 ) of @xcite and the discussions that follow ) .    in an earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "we had extended and complemented the work of @xcite by looking at the aps subject to such ` potential constraints ' for large values of @xmath11 , motivated by partial @xmath13-@xmath12 @xcite or full @xmath14-@xmath13-@xmath12 yukawa unification @xcite .",
    "such unifications are natural consequences of an underlying grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "we considered a popular model in which the gut group so(10 ) breaks directly into the sm gauge group su(3 ) @xmath15 su(2 ) @xmath15 u(1 ) .",
    "all matter fields belonging to a particular generation is contained in a 16 dimensional representation of so(10 ) . with a minimal higgs field content ( one * 10 * -plet containing both the higgs doublets required to give masses to u and d type quarks )",
    "all three yukawa couplings related to the third generation fermions must unify at the gut scale .",
    "if one assumes more than one * 10 * -plet , at least the bottom and the tau yukawa couplings should unify .",
    "in @xcite we assumed a common soft breaking ( sb ) mass ( @xmath5 ) at @xmath16 for all sfermions of a given generation .",
    "similarly a common mass parameter ( @xmath6 ) was chosen for both the higgs fields .",
    "we then studied the stability of the potential for two sets of boundary conditions : i ) the msugra motivated universal scenario ( @xmath17 ) , and ii ) a nonuniversal scenario ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the second condition is motivated by the fact that a common scalar mass at the planck scale , generated , by the sugra mechanism , may lead to nonuniversal scalar masses at @xmath16 due to different running of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as they belong to different gut multiplets @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall extend the work of @xcite by considering the aps due to yukawa unification and ufb constraints in the presence of so(10 ) breaking d - terms .",
    "the group @xmath21 contains @xmath22 as a subgroup .",
    "it is well known that the breaking of so(10 ) to the lower rank sm group may introduce nonzero d - terms at the gut scale@xcite .",
    "we further assume that the d - terms are linked to the breaking of @xmath23 only .",
    "it should be noted that if one assumes the existence of additional @xmath24 s at high energies , it is quite natural to assume that the d - term contributions to scalar masses are non - zero@xcite .",
    "the only uncertainty lies in the magnitude of the d - terms which may or may not be significant .",
    "the squark - slepton and higgs soft breaking masses in this case can be parametrized as @xmath25 + @xmath26 + @xmath27 + where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are su(2 ) doublets of squarks and sleptons , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are su(2 ) singlet charged sleptons , up and down type squarks respectively .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath33 ( the d - term ) can be of either sign .",
    "the mass differences arise because of the differences in the @xmath24 quantum numbers of the sparticles concerned . as can be readily seen from the above formula for @xmath34 0 ,",
    "the left handed sleptons and right handed down type squarks ( belonging to the @xmath35 representation of @xmath36 ) , are lighter than the members of the @xmath37 plet of @xmath36 . in recent times the phenomenology of the d - terms has attained wide attention@xcite .",
    "d - terms acquire particular significance in the context of @xmath38 unification as has already been noted in the literature @xcite .",
    "a new result of this work is that while moderate values of d - terms facilitate very accurate unification , high values of this parameter spoil it .",
    "the ufb and ccb constraints depend crucially on the particle spectra at the properly chosen scale where the true minimum and the dangerous minimum can be reliably evaluated from the tree level potential ( @xmath39 ) @xcite .",
    "such spectra , in turn , depend on the boundary conditions at the gut scale .",
    "the so(10 ) breaking d - terms alter the sparticle spectra at the gut scale and may affect the stability of the potential . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the impact of such d - terms on the aps restricted by yukawa unification and the stability of the potential in both universal and nonuniversal scenarios .    throughout the paper",
    "we ignore the possibility that nonrenormalizable effective operators may stabilise the potential @xcite .",
    "the dangerous minima that we encounter in our analysis typically occur at scales @xmath40 gev where the effects induced by the nonrenormalizable operators , which in principle can be significant in the vicinity of the gut scale , are not likely to be very serious .",
    "it has been pointed out in the literature that the standard vacuum , though metastable , may have a lifetime longer than the age of the universe @xcite , while the true vacuum is indeed charge and colour breaking .",
    "if this be the case , the theory seems to be acceptable in spite of the existence of the unacceptable ufb minima that we have analysed .",
    "however , the life - time calculation , which is relatively straightforward for a single scalar field , is much more uncertain in theories where the potential is a function of many scalar fields .",
    "thus it is difficult to judge the reliability of these calculations .",
    "moreover , the constraints obtained by us does not loose their significance even if the false vacuum idea happens to be the correct theory .",
    "if these constraints are violated by future expeimental data then that would automatically lead to the startling conclusion that we are living in a false vacuum and charge and colour symmetry may eventually breakdown .",
    "it has been known for quite some time that while @xmath41(in our sign convention which is opposite to that of haber and kane @xcite ) is required by yukawa unification , the opposite sign is preferred by the data on the branching ratio of b @xmath42 s @xmath43 and that on @xmath44 - 2 ( see @xcite for some of the recent analyses and references to the earlier works ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite and also in the first paper of @xcite that in a narrow region of the parameter space there is no conflict between data and yukawa unification .",
    "we have analysed the parameter space found in @xcite in the light of the stability of the vacuum and the results are given in the next section ( see table 1 in particular ) .",
    "the above conflict may also be resolved by introducing non - universal gaugino masses ( see chattopadhaya and nath in @xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the effects of @xmath11 , @xmath45 and sign of @xmath9 on yukawa unification and stability of the potential . in subsection 2.2 and 2.3",
    "we study the aps for both @xmath38 and @xmath46 unification in conjunction with the ufb constraints . in the last section we summarise and conclude .",
    "the methodology of finding the spectra is the same as in @xcite , which is based on the computer program isasugra , a part of the isajet package , vesion 7.48@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath47 are fixed by radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) @xcite at a scale @xmath48 .",
    "we further require that the lightest neutralino ( @xmath49 ) be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the above two constraints will also be used to obtain the allowed parameter space ( aps ) although their use may not be mentioned explicitly everywhere .",
    "we then fix @xmath11 to its lowest value required by yukawa unification .",
    "next we check the experimental constraints on sparticle masses .",
    "finally we impose the ufb constraints .    before discussing the basic reasons of how yukawa unification plays a significant role in restricting the aps , we will review the different uncertainties of yukawa unification .",
    "the effectiveness of yukawa unification as a restrictor of the aps diminishes , as expected , as the accuracy with which we require the unification to hold good is relaxed .",
    "there are several reasons why the unification may not be exact .",
    "first , there may be threshold corrections @xcite , both at the susy breaking scale ( due to nondegeneracy of the sparticles ) and at @xmath16 , of which no exact estimate exist .",
    "secondly , we have used two - loop rges for the evolutions of gauge couplings as well as yukawa couplings and one loop rges for the soft breaking parameters , but higher order loop corrections may be important at a few percent level at higher energy scales .",
    "finally the success of the unification program is also dependent on the choice of @xmath50 which is not known as precisely as @xmath51 or @xmath52 . to take into account such uncertainties ,",
    "one relaxes the yukawa unification condition to a finite amount ( 5% , 10% or 20% ) which should indirectly take care of the above caveats .",
    "the demand of very accurate yukawa coupling unification at @xmath16 puts severe constraint on @xmath11 restricting it to very large values only .    the accuracy of the @xmath38 unification is usually relaxed since there are more elements of uncertainty , _ e.g. _ , the choice of the higgs sector . to quantify this accuracy",
    ", one can define three variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 where generically @xmath55 .",
    "for example , to check whether the couplings unify , one should select only those points in the parameter space where , @xmath56 ( for 10% @xmath38 unification ) and @xmath57 ( for 5% @xmath46 unification ) .",
    "now we will focus on the basic reasons which lead to upper and lower bounds on the aps in the @xmath58 plane , if partial ( @xmath46 ) or full ( @xmath38 ) unification is required .",
    "it is wellknown that for precise yukawa unification one should have @xmath59 .",
    "the partial yukawa unification can be accommodated at relatively low values of @xmath11 when the phenomenologically interesting small @xmath60 region of the parameter space is allowed ( viz . for @xmath61 200 gev , the required minimum value of tan@xmath62 and for @xmath61 800 gev , @xmath63 41 ) . on the otherhand @xmath11",
    "can not be arbitrarily increased due to the rewsb .",
    "this basic trend , which often makes the two constraints incompatible , remains unaltered irrespective of the choice of the other parameters .",
    "the constraints due to yukawa unification and rewsb are relatively weak for large negative values of @xmath3 and becomes stronger as this parameter is algebraically increased .",
    "as one goes to larger negative values of @xmath3 .",
    "there is , therefore , more room for increasing @xmath11 , if required , without violating rewsb condition .",
    "this point was not ellaborated in our earlier work@xcite . ] on the other hand , the ufb constraints are very potent for large negative values of @xmath3 .",
    "the expanded aps allowed by yukawa unification , is eaten up by the ufb constraints . in this sense",
    "the two sets of constraints are complementary@xcite .",
    "@xmath64 varies relatively slowly with respect to tan@xmath65 compared to @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for very accurate ( 5 % ) @xmath38 unification , we , therefore , need high values of @xmath68 . in this case",
    "the low @xmath69 region is excluded by the rewsb condition , leading to lower bounds much stronger than the experimental ones and the resulting aps is restricted to phenomenologically uninteresting high @xmath60 region .",
    "for example , with @xmath11 = 49.5 the lowest allowed values are @xmath70600gev , @xmath71gev leading to rather heavy sparticles .    in the presence of d - terms a larger aps",
    "is obtained even if very accurate full unification is required@xcite .",
    "a new finding of this paper is that though moderate values of @xmath45 leads to better yukawa unification , somewhat larger values spoil it .",
    "although the d - terms do not affect the evolution of the yukawa couplings directly through the rges , they change the initial conditions through susy radiative corrections to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ yu0][yu3 ] , where approximate unification is studied for three different values of @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of other susy parameters for these figures are as follows : @xmath73 = 1500gev ,  @xmath74 = 500gev ,  tan@xmath65=48.5 , @xmath3 = 0 and @xmath59 . from fig [ yu0 ] ( @xmath75 ) , we see that the accuracy of unification is rather modest ( @xmath76 ) . as @xmath45 is further increased to @xmath77 ( fig.[yu5 ] ) , the @xmath78 loop corrections ( see eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite ) to @xmath72 increases and leads to better unification .",
    "however , if we increase @xmath45 further to @xmath79 , the accuracy of unification deteriorates ( fig .",
    "[ yu3 ] ) since @xmath72 suffers a correction which is too large .",
    "we have checked that this feature holds for a wide choice of susy parameters .",
    "quite often the aps expanded due to the presence of d - terms is significantly reduced by the ufb constraints . as discussed in our earlier work@xcite ,",
    "the variation of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the soft breaking masses of the two higgs bosons , with respect to the common trilinear coupling @xmath3 is of crucial importance in understanding this .",
    "here we extend the discussion for non - zero values of the d - term , @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mh2md ] .",
    "as we increase the magnitude of the d - term , the ufb3 becomes more potent though ufb1 looses its restrictive power for a fixed value of @xmath11 . to clarify this result we examine two important expressions of casas @xcite .",
    "the first one is + + 2 ^ 2 2 |b| , [ ufbone ] which is known as the ufb1 condition and should be satisfied at any scale @xmath85 , in particular at the unification scale @xmath86 .",
    "the second one is the ufb3 constraint , v_ufb3=[+m_l_i^2]|h_u|^2+[m_l_j^2 + m_e_j^2+m_l_i^2]|h_u|- , [ ufbthree ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are normalised gauge couplings of @xmath24 and @xmath89 respectively , @xmath90 is a yukawa coupling and @xmath91 are generation indices .",
    "we find that larger @xmath45 drives @xmath80 to more negative values , while @xmath81 is driven to positive values ( see fig .",
    "[ mh2md ] ) . in addition",
    ", it follows from rewsb condition that as the difference @xmath92 increases , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath9 increases . as a result the ufb1 constraint becomes weaker for large @xmath45 values ( see eq .",
    "[ ufbone ] ) . on the otherhand at the gut scale ,",
    "@xmath93 becomes smaller for larger @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "[ ufbthree ] it can be concluded that the parameter space where @xmath94 is negative increases and the model is more succeptible to the ufb3 codition .",
    "these effects will be reflected in @xmath46 unification as well .    for precise",
    "( @xmath95 5% ) @xmath38 unification the required @xmath11 is very high ( @xmath96 ) and the allowed @xmath5 values are large . here",
    "the magnitude of @xmath9 as determined by the rewsb becomes very low even for moderate values of the d - term ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "consequently ufb1 still disallows a significant part of the enlarged aps obtained with introduction of the d - term .",
    "however , the effectiveness of the ufb1 constraint depends crucially on @xmath3 .",
    "we see that @xmath98 is ruled out by ufb1 if the d - term is zero . in presence of the d",
    "- terms the ufb1 constraints become weaker but still have some restrictive power for @xmath7 . moreover ufb3 becomes weaker for large @xmath5 in general .",
    "now we shall discuss the impact of the sign of @xmath9 on both ufb constraints and yukawa unification .",
    "yukawa unification generally favours @xmath41 .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 affects unification through loop corrections@xcite to the bottom yukawa coupling , which are incorporated at the weak scale .",
    "these corrections lower the bottom yukawa coupling significantly , consequently the gut scale value bcomes very low , which tends to spoil yukawa unification .",
    "baer@xcite showed that for @xmath99 full unification with low accuracy ( @xmath100 ) is possible .",
    "this is interesting since approximate unification then becomes consistent with the constraints from @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the muon .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the yukawa unified aps favours @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have extended the analysis of ref@xcite for @xmath99 and have found that the ufb1 condition looses it effectiveness for @xmath105 .",
    "the bottom yukawa coupling affects the value of @xmath81 through renormalization group ( rg ) running and can not make @xmath81 large negative as in the @xmath59 case .",
    "this is why ufb1 is weakened ( see eq .",
    "[ ufbone ] ) .",
    "we have studied the aps obtained in @xcite and found that ufb1 can disallow certain negative values of @xmath33 depending on the magnitudes of @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath106 are increased , relatively small negative values of @xmath33 make the potential unstable under ufb1 condition .",

    "we shall restrict ourselves to unification within 5% .",
    "for the sake of completeness and systematic analysis , we start our discussion for large negative values of @xmath3 ( say , @xmath110 ) , though it is not interesting from the point of view of collider searches .",

    "this is primarily due to two reasons : i ) yukawa unification can now be accommodated for lower values of tan@xmath65 ( @xmath148 ) and ii ) rewsb is allowed at somewhat higher values of @xmath11 than the values permitted in @xmath149 case .",
    "this reduces the conflict between yukawa unification and rewsb . as a result @xmath8",
    "almost as low as that allowed by the lep bound on the chargino mass is permitted over a wide range of @xmath5 . in some cases",
    "the upper bound on @xmath5 for a given @xmath8 is also relaxed .",
    "similarly for a fixed @xmath5 , the upper bound on @xmath8 is sometimes relaxed by few hundred gevs . through out",
    "this work we require this partial unification to an accuracy of @xmath150 5% .",
    "now we will focus our attention on large negative values of @xmath3 ( @xmath110 ) with @xmath111 in the universal scenario .",
    "the unification allowed aps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ btaum0p1md5a0_2 ] , expands compared to the @xmath45 = 0 scenario ( compare with fig . 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the phenomenologically interesting scenario with light gauginos but very heavy sleptons and squarks beyond the reach of lhc , which was rather disfavoured without the d - terms ( see @xcite ) , is now viable . without the d - term",
    ", the aps was severely restricted by the ufb conditions for large negative values of @xmath3 . as discussed earlier , inclusion of the d - term increases the value of @xmath9 . as a result",
    "ufb1 looses its constraining power ; lower values of @xmath8 are allowed for large @xmath5 by ufb1 . on the other hand as the value of d - term increases ,",
    "ufb3 becomes more powerful and the upper bounds on @xmath8 for relatively low values of @xmath5 get stronger ( for @xmath5 = 600(1000)gev , @xmath151 300(600)gev ) . for @xmath152",
    ", the aps again expands .",
    "however , the ufb constraints are found to be progressively weaker as @xmath3 is increased from @xmath110 .",
    "we next consider the non - unversal scenerio @xmath153 . if we take @xmath137 ( say , @xmath154 ) and @xmath155 , the unification allowed parameter space for @xmath110 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ btaum0p.6md5a0_2 ] , is more or less the same as in the universal scenario .",
    "the entire aps is , however , ruled out due to a very powerful constraint obtained from the ufb3 condition .",
    "this conclusion obviously holds for larger values of @xmath45 .    for @xmath133 and large negative @xmath3 ( @xmath156 ) , the unification allowed aps ( fig .",
    "[ btaum0p1.2md5a0_2 ] ) is smaller compared to that in the universal case ( fig .",
    "[ btaum0p1md5a0_2 ] ) .",
    "the same trend was also observed with @xmath75@xcite .",
    "the aps , however , is significantly larger than that for @xmath149 . for a given @xmath8 ( @xmath5 )",
    "the upper - bound on @xmath5 ( @xmath8 ) gets weaker for non - zero d - terms .",
    "relatively light gluinos consistent with current bounds are allowed over a larger region of the parameter space .",
    "the ufb constraints restrict the aps further and put rather strong bounds on @xmath8 and @xmath5 . a large fraction of this restricted aps is accessible to tests at lhc energies .",
    "the usual reduction of the aps due to unification constraints as @xmath3 is increased from @xmath156 also holds in this nonuniversal scenario .",
    "if we increase @xmath45 further , the aps due to yukawa unification reduces for reasons already discussed .",
    "the ufb1 constraint also gets weaker . on the other hand",
    "the ufb3 constraints become rather potent . for example , i ) with @xmath156 and @xmath139 the entire aps for @xmath157 or @xmath137 is ruled out .",
    "ii ) @xmath118 and @xmath158 the entire aps corresponding to @xmath157 or @xmath137 is ruled out . on the other hand , for @xmath133",
    "the aps further reduces as @xmath45 is increased .",
    "for moderate values of the d - terms @xmath159 , the aps expands in general compared to the @xmath75 case for both @xmath46 and @xmath38 yukawa unification .",
    "a large fraction of the enlarged aps is , however , reduced by the requirement of vacuum stability and the predictive power is not lost altogether .",
    "d - terms with much larger magnitudes , however , are not favourable for unification . in the @xmath38 yukawa unified model ( accuracy @xmath160 ) ,",
    "a band of very low gaugino mass close to the current experimental lower limit is a common feature in the presence of d - terms . for a given @xmath5",
    "there is an upper bound on @xmath8 from unification and stability of the potential constraints .",
    "this happens for @xmath161 . outside this range of @xmath3 ,",
    "the aps is very small with sparticle masses of the first two generations well above 1 tev . in @xmath46 unification ,",
    "ufb3 strongly restricts the aps while ufb1 becomes less potent in the presence of d - terms .",
