    "this paper studies the discrete - time noisy linear system , @xmath0 when the matrix @xmath1 is stochastic .",
    "the vector @xmath2 represents noise , and we will assume it to be a random vector with zero mean , covariance @xmath3 and having the property that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent whenever @xmath6 .",
    "this recursion is often known as the consensus iteration .",
    "this is because the noiseless version @xmath7 has the property that @xmath8 converges to @xmath9 , the subspace spanned by the all - ones vector , subject to some mild technical assumptions on the matrix @xmath1 .",
    "consensus protocols have many applications in algorithm design for distributed and multi - agent systems , where one usually thinks of each component @xmath10 as being controlled by a different `` agent , '' with the agents asymptotically  coming to consensus  as all the components of @xmath8 approach the same value .",
    "indeed , the design of distributed policies for control and signal processing in networks of potentially mobile agents has attracted considerable attention in recent years , and the past decade of research has led to the understanding that a key tool for such systems is the consensus iteration . it turns out that many sophisticated network coordination tasks can be either entirely reduced to consensus or have decentralized solutions where the consensus iteration plays a key role ; we mention formation control @xcite , distributed optimization @xcite , coverage control @xcite , distributed task assignment @xcite , networked kalman filtering @xcite , cooperative flocking / leader - following @xcite , among many others .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to understand exactly how much the `` coming to consensus '' property deteriorates due to the addition of the noise term @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ noisecons ] ) . in a sense to be made precise next , we would like to characterize how far all the @xmath10 are from each other in the limit as @xmath11 , and to understand how the answer depends on combinatorial properties of the matrix @xmath1",
    ".    intuitively , the action of multiplying a vector @xmath8 by a stochastic matrix @xmath1 has the effect of bringing the components @xmath10 `` closer together , '' while the addition of the noise @xmath2 counteracts that ; the two processes result in some equilibrium level of expected disagreement as @xmath11 .",
    "we are motivated by the observation ( made in some of the previous literature on the subject and discussed more formally later ) that the equilibrium level of disagreement often _ grows with the dimension of the matrix @xmath1_.    thus even though eq .",
    "( [ noisecons ] ) is stable in the sense that expected disagreement between any pair of nodes is bounded as @xmath11 , this stability can be almost meaningless for large systems .",
    "this has implications for all distributed protocols which rely on consensus , as it implies that in some cases they may not be robust under the addition of noise .",
    "understanding exactly when this happens is the goal of this paper .",
    "this paper has a simple main result which serves to unify and extend several previous works , and we begin with a concise statement of it .",
    "we start with a number of definitions .",
    "we will assume @xmath1 to be an irreducible and aperiodic matrix , and we let @xmath12 be the stationary distribution vector , i.e. , @xmath13 we will use @xmath14 to stand for the diagonal matrix whose @xmath15th entry is @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we define the weighted average vector , @xmath17 as well as the error vector @xmath18    intuitively , @xmath19 measures how far away the vector @xmath8 is from consensus . indeed",
    ", it is easy to see that the noiseless update @xmath20 has the property that @xmath8 converges to @xmath21 . the quantity @xmath19 thus measures the difference between the `` current state '' @xmath8 and the limit of the noiseless version of eq .",
    "( [ noisecons ] ) starting from @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to understand how big the error @xmath19 is as @xmath22 goes to infinity .",
    "we will measure this by considering the following two linear combinations of squared errors at each node , @xmath23 \\\\",
    "\\delta^{\\rm uni}(t ) & : = & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i=1}^n e[e_i^2(t)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , we weigh the squared error at each node either proportionally to the stationary distribution of the node or uniformly . finally , our actual measures of performance will be the asymptotic quantities @xmath24 which measure the limiting disagreement among the nodes .",
    "we will sometimes write @xmath25 when the update matrix @xmath1 and the noise covariance @xmath26 are not clear from context and likewise for @xmath27 .    before stating our main result ,",
    "let us recall the notion of a hitting time from node @xmath28 to node @xmath29 in a markov chain : this is the expected time until the chain visits @xmath29 starting from node @xmath28 .",
    "we use @xmath30 to denote this hitting time in the markov chain whose probability transition matrix is @xmath31 . by convention , @xmath32 for all @xmath28 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath33 to denote the matrix whose @xmath34th element is @xmath30 .    with the above definitions in place , we are now able to state the main result of this paper",
    ".    if the markov chain with transition matrix @xmath1 is reversible , then @xmath35 [ mainthm ]    the theorem characterizes @xmath36 in terms of combinatorial quantities associated with an underlying markov chain , namely the stationary distribution and the hitting times . inspecting the theorem , note that it expresses @xmath36 in terms of a _ difference _ of two linear combinations of entries of the matrix @xmath37 , both with nonnegative coefficients which add up to @xmath38 .",
    "as we will demonstrate later , we can often use this theorem as the basis for `` back - of - the - envelope '' calculations which result in accurate bounds on @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , this theorem captures the intuition that not all noises are created equal , in the sense that noise at key locations should have a higher contribution to the limiting disagreement .",
    "indeed , in the event that noises at different nodes are uncorrelated , the second term of theorem [ mainthm ] is easily seen to be zero and we obtain @xmath39 we see that in this case @xmath36 is a linear combination of the variances at each node , where the variance @xmath40 multiplied by @xmath41 .",
    "note that this multiplier is a product of a measure of importance coming from the stationary distribution ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) and a measure of the `` mean accessibility '' of a node ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .    in the event that all noises have the same variance , we obtain the simplified version @xmath44 as we discuss later in this paper , for many classes of matrices @xmath1 the quantity @xmath45 grows linearly with the total dimension of the system @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , although the system is technically stable in the sense of having bounded expected disagreement as @xmath11 , this stability is almost meaningless if @xmath38 is large . equations ( [ uceq ] ) and ( [ samevar ] ) allow us to determine when this is the case by analyzing how stationary distribution and hitting times grow on various kinds of graphs is not fully characterized by the spectral gap of the underlying graph ; see , for example , the table in section [ sec : table ] . ] . later in the paper ( in section [ examples ] ) we will use these equations to work out how @xmath36 scales for a variety of matrices @xmath1 which come from graphs .",
    "this paper has two main contributions .",
    "the first is to prove theorem [ mainthm ] ( which unifies a number of earlier results in the literature ) and use it to obtain order - optimal estimates for @xmath36 for a variety of matrices @xmath1 naturally associated with graphs .",
    "our second contribution is to demonstrate the utility of theorem [ mainthm ] by describing the connection of @xmath36 to opinion dynamics , clock synchronization , and formation control , and in particular by analyzing the scalability of certain protocols for formation control in the presence of noise and distributed clock synchronization .    additionally , we discuss corollaries of this theorem which connect @xmath36 to notions of graph resistance , the kemeny constant of a markov chain , and other graph - theoretic quantities .",
    "we also discuss the connection between @xmath36 and the related quantity @xmath27 , and show that , as a byproduct of theorem [ mainthm ] , we can obtain the tightest known combinatorial upper and lower bounds on @xmath27 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we conclude the introduction with section [ prevwork ] which discusses the previous literature and places our results in the context of existing work .",
    "the subsequent section [ motivation ] discusses noisy opinion dynamics , distributed clock synchronization in a network , and noisy formation control , and shows that the behavior of dynamics in these problems can , in many cases , be written as the @xmath36 of an appropriately defined matrix .",
    "we then turn to the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] , which is proved in section [ proof ] .",
    "the following section [ examples ] uses theorem [ mainthm ] to compute order - optimal estimates for @xmath36 on a variety of ( not necessarily symmetric ) matrices coming from graphs and discusses connections between @xmath36 and other graph - theoretic quantities .",
    "section [ symmetric ] collects a number of observations and simplifications that can be made under the assumption that the matrix @xmath1 is symmetric and then revisits the problems of formation control and clock synchronization , in particular characterizing their performance on many different graphs .",
    "section [ simul ] contains some simulations , and we conclude with some final remarks in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] can be thought of as a unification and extension of several results in the existing literature .",
    "the problem of analyzing the equilibrium level of disagreement in consensus with noise was initiated in @xcite where it was shown that for symmetric @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 in fact , the expression on the right - hand side equals the so - called kemeny constant of the markov chain @xmath48 , which we will formally define later and which is a certain linear combination of hitting times .",
    "the above equality follows from theorem [ mainthm ] ; see section [ sym.1 ] for details .",
    "several papers have explored the connection betwen @xmath49 and the electric resistance of the underlying graph .",
    "the recent work @xcite proved the inequality @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a measure of the average resistance associated with the stochastic , reversible matrix @xmath31 .",
    "as @xcite notes , in the case when @xmath1 is symmetric we have that @xmath52 and eq .",
    "( [ zmpeq ] ) becomes an equality ; thus for symmetric matrices , @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the average resistance . a similar reduction to resistance",
    "was remarked on in @xcite in continuous time .",
    "appealing to the fact that graph resistances can be written as a sum of hitting times @xcite , this equality turns out to be another special case of theorem [ mainthm ] ; see section [ sym.1 ] for details .",
    "furthermore , theorem [ mainthm ] may be viewed as a generalization of this equality in two ways : from symmetric to reversible chains , and from uncorrelated noise @xmath53 to general @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the reduction of various applications to consensus problems usually introduces introduction of correlation in the noises  see , for example , our discussion of clock synchronization and formation control in section [ motivation ]  meaning that it is of some importance to study the case of general correlation matrices @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that eq .",
    "( [ zmpeq ] ) provides combinatorial upper and lower bounds on @xmath54 whose ratio is @xmath55 , and the latter can be thought of as a measure of the skewness of the distribution of node influence .",
    "the problem of obtaining a combinatorial expression for @xmath27 is still open ; we will later show later ( in section [ unibound ] ) that , as a corollary of theorem [ mainthm ] , it is possible to provide combinatorial upper and lower bounds on @xmath27 whose ratio is only @xmath56 .    finally , the main observation that eq .",
    "( [ noisecons ] ) can have asymptotic disagreement which grows with the size of the system was , to our knowledge , first made in @xcite ( in continuous time ) . as observed in @xcite in the context of vehicular formation control",
    ", this means that any protocol which relies on consensus iterations can suffer from a considerable degradation of performance in large networks .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that topology can have a profound influence on performance , by proving that while on the ring graph the asymptotic disagreement grows linearly with the number of nodes , it remains bounded on the 3d torus ( and grows only logarithmically on the 2d torus ) .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] allows us to replicate these calculations ( in discrete - time ) and extend them to many different graphs , as well as to understand the separate effects of noise at each node ; see the myriad of worked - out examples in section [ examples ] and in particular the table in section [ sec : table ] .",
    "we next mention some other closely related strands of literature .",
    "our work is related to the recent sequence of papers @xcite which considered the effects of noise in a continuous - time version of eq .",
    "( [ noisecons ] ) over _ directed _ graphs ( by contrast , our assumption that @xmath1 corresponds to a reversible and irreducible markov chain implies that @xmath57 if and only if @xmath58 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "explicit expressions for a measure of steady - state disagreement were computed for a number of graphs .",
    "the paper @xcite investigated steady - state disagreement on trees and derived a partial ordering capturing which trees have smaller steady - state disagreements .",
    "the papers @xcite studied leader selection problems wherein we must choose leader(s ) to track an external signal .",
    "it turns out that optimal leader selection is related to a novel measure of information centrality as explained in @xcite . the recent work @xcite considered relaxations of such leader selection problems in terms of semi - definite programming .",
    "other related work includes @xcite which investigated consensus - like protocols with noise in continuous time , focusing on connections with measures of sparsity such as number of spanning trees , number of cut - edges , and the degree - sequence .",
    "the related paper @xcite investigated several measures of robustness related to @xmath36 in terms of their convexity . the recent paper @xcite characterized steady - state disagreement in a number of fractal graphs .",
    "our earlier work @xcite focused on connections between asymptotic disagreement and the cheeger constant and coefficients of ergodicity of the corresponding markov chain .",
    "finally , we mention again the paper @xcite which began the literature on the subject by formulating the problem of optimizing @xmath36 over symmetric matrices with a given graph structure as a convex optimization problem ; and the recent paper @xcite which considered approximation algorithms for the problem of designing networks that minimize @xmath36 .",
    "as we have previously remarked , consensus protocols have been central to a number of recent advances in distributed control and signal processing . in this section",
    ", we focus on three motivating scenarios , namely the analysis of opinion dynamics with noise , synchronizing clocks in a network , and the problem of formation maintenance . for each of these problems , we spell out the reduction to an appropriately defined consensus problem and explain how these problems lead to the study of the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath27 .",
    "the mathematical study of opinion dynamics is an old subject dating back to the classic works of stone @xcite , harrary @xcite , and degroot @xcite which has recently experienced a resurgence of interest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is , of course , impossible to accurately model the behavior of human beings , which are the result of a complex interaction of a host of psychological processes .",
    "nevertheless , human societies do appear to exhibit regularities @xcite , for example in the emergence of common languages or consensus around particular issues , and it is of interest to understand whether these global regularities may be accounted for with simple models of human behavior .",
    "correspondingly , the goal of much of the recent research is to investigate the macroscopic consequences of simple rules for opinion change inspired by the experimental literature on small group dynamics .",
    "we next describe a popular model for consensus formation known as the _ degroot model_. following the classic works of @xcite , we consider a group of @xmath38 individuals , each of which has an opinion modeled by the vector @xmath59 .",
    "we may think of @xmath60 as stacking up the opinions of individual @xmath28 on @xmath61 distinct issues .",
    "there is an underlying graph @xmath62 , which we assume to be undirected , and agents repeatedly interact with their neighbors in this graph . as a result",
    ", we have a discrete - time dynamic system where the opinions @xmath10 of the agents are updated as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the set of neighbors of node @xmath28 and @xmath65 is some collection of nonnegative numbers .    intuitively , each agent that interacts with @xmath28 moves @xmath28th opinion in his or her own direction .",
    "it is standard assume @xmath66 , which is equivalent to requiring that every node is influenced by its own opinion in its updates .",
    "the degroot model is consistent with empirical findings that discussion of opinions in small groups usually results in opinions that lie somewhere between the maximum and minimum opinions of the participants @xcite , as well as with the sociological analysis of mechanisms which produce opinion change @xcite .",
    "we remark that the matrix @xmath67 $ ] in the degroot model is reversible for many common choices of the coefficients @xmath65 .",
    "for example , one natural choice of weights is @xmath68 which leads to the update rule , @xmath69 corresponding to each agent averaging its own opinion with the mean opinion of its neighbors . more generally , a natural choice of @xmath65 comes from adding self - loops to the graph and assigning weights @xmath70 to each edge representing the strength of the relationship between agents @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and finally setting @xmath71 in other words , each individual takes a convex combination of the opinions of its neighbors but with weights depending on the strength of the underlying relationship .",
    "it is not hard to see that eq .",
    "( [ lazyweight ] ) is a special case of this , and that the matrix @xmath1 corresponding to such a choice of coefficients is always reversible is proportional to @xmath72 , from which one can immediately calculate that @xmath73 . ] .    in this form",
    ", the model was first proposed by degroot in @xcite .",
    "it stands in contrast to `` bounded confidence '' models , which model scenarios where each individual only interacts with agents whose opinions are not too different from its own @xcite . in the degroot model ,",
    "every individual interacts with its neighbors in the graph regardless of the difference in their opinions",
    ". we do not provide a detailed overview of the opinion dynamics literature , which is quite copious and where many variations on these rules have been proposed and studied , but instead refer the reader to the surveys @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the main contribution of this paper is an expression for the weighted steady - state disagreement in reversible stochastic linear systems in terms of stationary distribution and hitting times in an underlying graph .",
    "we have further shown that this expression is useful in analyzing distributed protocols for clock synchronization and formation control .",
    "an open question is whether similar expressions might be obtained without the assumption of reversibility .",
    "furthermore , the question of obtaining an exact  combinatorial expression for the quantity @xmath27 is also open . finally , it is also interesting to consider how the results we have presented here might be extended to time - varying linear systems .",
    "more broadly , we wonder whether one can find more connections between probabilistic or combinatorial quantities and the behavior of linear systems . indeed , we would argue that the past decade of research of distributed control has highlighted the importance of studying linear systems on graphs .",
    "relating classical quantities of interest in control theory , such as stability and noise robustness , to the combinatorial features of the graphs underlying the system could have a significant repercussions in the control of multi - agent systems .",
