    "in the past few years , research on the detection of gravitational waves has assumed new directions .",
    "efforts are now underway to detect gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources , thereby enabling researchers to possess an additional tool to study the universe ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . according to newton s theory of gravitation ,",
    "the binary period of two point masses ( e.g. , two stars ) moving in a bound orbit is strictly a constant quantity .",
    "however , einstein s general theory of relativity predicts that two stars revolving around each other in a bound orbit suffer accelerations , and , as a result , gravitational radiation is generated .",
    "gravitational waves carry away energy and momentum at the expense of the orbital decay of two stars , thereby causing the stars to gradually spiral towards each other and giving rise to shorter and shorter periods .",
    "this anticipated decrease of the orbital period of a binary pulsar was first observed in psr 1913 + 16 by taylor and weisberg ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation supported the idea of gravitational radiation first propounded in 1916 by einstein in the proceedings of the royal prussian academy of knowledge .",
    "einstein showed that the first order contributon to the gravitational radiation must be quadrupolar in a particular coordinate system .",
    "two years later , he extended his theory to all coordinate systems .",
    "the weak nature of gravitational radiation makes it very difficult to design a sensitive detector .",
    "filtering out the noisy background to isolate the useful signal requires great technical expertise . itself a field of research .",
    "various gravitational wave detectors are fully / partially operational and we expect a certain result to appear from the observations in the near future .",
    "this article gives an elementary introduction to the theory of gravitational waves .",
    "important topics in general relativity including a brief introduction to tensors and a derivation of einstein s field equations are discussed in the appendices .",
    "we first discuss the weak gravitational field approximation and obtain the linearized einstein s field equations .",
    "we then discuss the plane wave solutions to these equations in vacuum and the restriction on them due to the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge .",
    "the motion of particles in the presence of gravitational waves and their polarization is then discussed in brief .",
    "we conclude by applying the method of green s functions to show that gravitational radiation from matter at large distances is predominantly quadrupolar in nature .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity leads to newtonian gravity in the limit when the gravitational field is weak & static and the particles in the gravitational field move slowly .",
    "we now consider a less restrictive situation where the gravitational field is weak but not static , and there are no restrictions on the motion of particles in the gravitational field . in the absence of gravity , space - time is flat and is characterised by the minkowski metric , @xmath0 .",
    "a weak gravitational field can be considered as a small perturbation on the flat minkowski metric@xcite , @xmath1 such coordinate systems are often called _ lorentz coordinate systems_. indices of any tensor can be raised or lowered using @xmath2 or @xmath0 respectively as the corrections would be of higher order in the perturbation , @xmath3 .",
    "we can therefore write , @xmath4 under a background lorentz transformation ( @xcite ) , the perturbation transforms as a second - rank tensor : @xmath5 the equations obeyed by the perturbation , @xmath3 , are obtained by writing the einstein s equations to first order . to the first order , the affine connection ( see app .",
    "a ) is , @xmath6 +   { \\cal{o}}(h^2)\\ ] ] therefore , the riemann curvature tensor reduces to @xmath7 the ricci tensor is obtained to the first order as @xmath8\\ ] ] where , @xmath9 is the dalembertian in flat space - time . contracting again with @xmath2 ,",
    "the ricci scalar is obtained as @xmath10 the einstein tensor , @xmath11 , in the limit of weak gravitational field is @xmath12\\ ] ] the linearised einstein field equations are then @xmath13 we ca nt expect the field equations ( 9 ) to have unique solutions as any solution to these equations will not remain invariant under a gauge transformation . as a result , equations ( 9 ) will have infinitely many solutions . in other words ,",
    "the decomposition ( 1 ) of @xmath14 in the weak gravitational field approximation does not completely specify the coordinate system in space - time .",
    "when we have a system that is invariant under a gauge transformation , we _",
    "fix _ the gauge and work in a selected coordinate system .",
    "one such coordinate system is the _ harmonic coordinate system _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge condition is @xmath15 in the weak field limit , this condition reduces to @xmath16 this condition is often called the _ lorentz gauge_. in this selected gauge ,",
    "the linearized einstein equations simplify to , @xmath17 the ` trace - reversed ' perturbation , @xmath18 , is defined as ( @xcite ) , @xmath19 the harmonic gauge condition further reduces to @xmath20 the einstein equations are then @xmath21 1.0 cm",
    "from the field equations in the weak - field limit , eqns.(15 ) , we obtain the linearised field equations in vacuum , @xmath22 the vacuum equations for @xmath18 are similar to the wave equations in electromagnetism .",
    "these equations admit the plane - wave solutions , @xmath23 where , @xmath24 is a constant , symmetric , rank-2 tensor and @xmath25 is a constant four - vector known as the _ wave vector_. plugging in the solution ( 17 ) into the equation ( 16 ) , we obtain the condition @xmath26 this implies that equation ( 17 ) gives a solution to the wave equation ( 16 ) if @xmath25 is _ null _ ; that is , tangent to the world line of a photon .",
    "this shows that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light .",
    "the time - like component of the wave vector is often referred to as the _ frequency _ of the wave .",
    "the four - vector , @xmath27 is usually written as @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath25 is null , it means that , @xmath29 this is often referred to as the _ dispersion relation _ for the gravitational wave .",
    "we can specify the plane wave with a number of independent parameters ; 10 from the coefficients , @xmath24 and three from the null vector , @xmath27 . using the harmonic gauge condition",
    "( 14 ) , we obtain , @xmath30 this imposes a restriction on @xmath31 : it is orthogonal ( _ transverse _ ) to @xmath25 . the number of independent components of @xmath24 is thus reduced to six .",
    "we have to impose a gauge condition too as any coordinate transformation of the form @xmath32 will leave the harmonic coordinate condition @xmath33 satisfied as long as @xmath34 let us choose a solution @xmath35 to the wave equation ( 23 ) for @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 are constant coefficients .",
    "we claim that this remaining freedom allows us to convert from the old constants , @xmath38 , to a set of new constants , @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 where , @xmath42 is some fixed four - velocity , that is , any constant time - like unit vector we wish to choose . the equations ( 20 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) together are called the _ transverse traceless _ ( tt ) gauge conditions ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have used up all the available gauge freedom and the remaining components of @xmath24 must be physically important .",
    "the trace condition ( 25 ) implies that @xmath43    let us now consider a background lorentz transformation in which the vector @xmath44 is the time basis vector @xmath45 .",
    "then eqn.(26 ) implies that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "let us orient the coordinate axes so that the wave is travelling along the z - direction , @xmath48 .",
    "then with eqn.(26 ) , eqn.(20 ) implies that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 in matrix form is @xmath52",
    "in this section , we consider the effect of gravitational waves on free particles .",
    "consider some particles described by a single velocity field , @xmath44 and a separation vector , @xmath53 .",
    "then , the separation vector obeys the geodesic equation ( see app . a ) @xmath54 where , @xmath55 is the four - velocity of the two particles .",
    "we consider the lowest - order ( flat - space ) components of @xmath56 only since any corrections to @xmath56 that depend on @xmath3 will give rise to terms second order in the perturbation in the above equation .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 and initially @xmath58 .",
    "then to first order in @xmath3 , eqn .",
    "( 29 ) reduces to @xmath59 using the definition of the riemann tensor , we can show that in the tt gauge , @xmath60 all other independent components vanish .",
    "this means that two particles initially separated in the x - direction have a separation vector which obeys the equation @xmath61 similarly , two particles initially separated by @xmath62 in the y - direction obey the equations @xmath63 we can now use these equations to describe the polarization of a gravitational wave . let us consider a ring of particles initially at rest as in fig .",
    "suppose a wave with @xmath64 hits them .",
    "the particles respond to the wave as shown in fig .",
    "first the particles along the x - direction come towards each other and then move away from each other as @xmath65 reverses sign .",
    "this is often called @xmath66 polarization . if the wave had @xmath67 , but , @xmath68 , then the particles respond as shown in fig",
    "this is known as @xmath69 polarization .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath65 are independent , the figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) demonstrate the existence of two different states of polarisation .",
    "the two states of polarisation are oriented at an angle of @xmath71 to each other unlike in electromagnetic waves were the two states of polarization .",
    "in section iii , we obtained the plane wave solutions to the linearized einstein s equations in vacuum , eqns.(16 ) . to obtain the solution of the linearised equations ( 15 )",
    ", we will use the green s function method .",
    "the green s function , @xmath72 , of the dalembertian operator @xmath73 , is the solution of the wave equation in the presence of a delta function source : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the four - dimensional dirac delta function .",
    "the general solution to the linearized einstein s equations ( 15 ) can be written using the green s function as @xmath76 the solutions to the eqn.(34 ) are called _ advanced _ or _ retarded _ according as they represent waves travelling backward or forward in time , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the retarded green s function as it represents the net effect of signals from the past of the point under consideration .",
    "it is given by @xmath77\\times~\\theta(x^0 - y^0)\\ ] ] where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 and @xmath80^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath81 is the heaviside unit step function , it equals 1 when @xmath82 , and equals 0 otherwise . using the relation ( 36 ) in ( 35 ) , we can perform the integral over @xmath83 with the help of the delta function , @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 is called the _ retarded time_. from the expression ( 37 ) for @xmath87 , we observe that the disturbance in the gravitational field at @xmath88 is a sum of the influences from the energy and momentum sources at the point @xmath89 on the past light cone .",
    "using the expression ( 37 ) , we now consider the gravitational radiation emitted by an isolated far away source consisting of very slowly moving particles ( the spatial extent of the source is negligible compared to the distance between the source and the observer ) .",
    "the fourier transform of the perturbation @xmath18 is @xmath90 using the expression ( 37 ) for @xmath91 , we get @xmath92 under the assumption that the spatial extent of the source is negligible compared to the distance between the source and the observer , we can replace the term @xmath93 in ( 40 ) by @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath95 the harmonic gauge condition ( 14 ) in fourier space is @xmath96 separating out the space and time components , @xmath97 or , @xmath98 thus , in eqn.(41 ) , we need to consider the space - like components of @xmath99 .",
    "consider , @xmath100 on using gauss theorem , we obtain , @xmath101 consider the fourier space version of the conservation equation for @xmath102 , viz .",
    ", @xmath103 .",
    "separating the time and space components of the fourier transform equation , we have , @xmath104 therefore , @xmath105 consider @xmath106\\tilde{t}^{0l } + \\int d^3 y ~y^{i}~y^{j}\\left(\\partial_l \\tilde{t}^{0l}\\right)\\ ] ] simplifying the equation above , we obtain for the left hand side @xmath107 since the term on the left hand side of eqn.(47 ) is a surface term , it vanishes and we obtain @xmath108 using the equations ( 46 ) and ( 48 ) , we can write , @xmath109 using the eqn(45 ) , we can write , @xmath110 we define the _ quadrupole moment tensor _ of the energy density of the source as @xmath111 in terms of the quadrupole moment tensor , we have @xmath112 therefore , the solution ( 41 ) becomes @xmath113 simplifying further , @xmath114 taking the fourier transform of eqn.(54 ) , and simplifying , we finally obtain for the perturbation @xmath115 where , @xmath116 is the retarded time . in the expression ( 54 ) , we see that the gravitational wave produced by an isolated , monochromatic and non - relativistic source is therefore proportional to the second derivative of the quadrupole moment of the energy density at the point where the past light cone of the observer intersects the cone .",
    "the quadrupolar nature of the wave shows itself by the production of shear in the particle distribution , and there is zero average translational motion .",
    "the leading contribution to electromagnetic radiation comes from the changing dipole moment of the charge density .",
    "this remarkable difference in the nature of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation arises from the fact that the centre of mass of an isolated system ca nt oscillate freely but the centre of charge of a charge distribution can .",
    "the quadrupole momnet of a system is generally smaller than the dipole moment and hence gravitational waves are weaker than electromagnetic waves .",
    "this lecture note on gravitational waves leaves several topics untouched .",
    "there are a number of good references on gravitation where the inquisitive reader can find more about gravitational waves and their detection .",
    "i have freely drawn from various sources and i do nt claim any originality in this work .",
    "i hope i have been able to incite some interest in the reader about a topic on which there is a dearth of literature .",
    "0.6 cm this expository article grew out of a seminar presented at the end of the _ gravitation and cosmology _ course given by prof .",
    "ashoke sen .",

    "1.0 cm an event in relativity is characterised by a set of coordinates @xmath117 in a definite coordinate system .",
    "transformations between the coordinates of an event observed in two different reference frames are called _",
    "lorentz transformations_. these transformations mix up space and time and hence the coordinates are redefined so that all of them have dimensions of length .",
    "we write @xmath118 and a general component of a four vector ( @xmath119 ) as @xmath120 .",
    "a lorentz transformation is then written as @xmath121 where , @xmath122 at this point , it is useful to note the _ einstein summation convention _ : whenever an index appears as a subscript and as a superscript in an expression , we sum over all values taken by the index . under a lorentz transformation",
    ", the spacetime interval @xmath123 remains invariant .",
    "the length of a four - vector is given by @xmath124 we never extract a square root of the expression ( 59 ) since @xmath125 can be negative .",
    "four - vectors that have negative length are called _ time - like _ , while those with positive lengths are called _ space - like_. four - vectors with zero length are called _",
    "null_. the notion of `` norm '' of a four - vector is introduced with the help of the _ minkowski metric _ : @xmath126 then , we have , @xmath127 there are two kinds of vectors that are classified in the way they transform under a lorentz transformation : @xmath128 vectors are _ tensors _ of rank one .",
    "@xmath129 is called the metric tensor ; it is a tensor of rank two .",
    "there are other higher rank tensors which we will encounter later .",
    "if two coordinate systems are linked by a lorentz transformation as : @xmath130 then , multiplying both sides of the equation above by @xmath131 and differentiating , we get , @xmath132 therefore , we see that @xmath133 thus , @xmath134 transforms as a covariant vector .",

    "coordinate system is sufficient . in an inertial frame",
    ", a particle at rest will remain so if no forces act on it .",
    "there is a frame where particles move with a uniform velocity .",
    "this is the frame which falls freely in a gravitational field .",
    "since this frame accelerates at the same rate as the free particles do , it follows that all such particles will maintain a uniform velocity relative to this frame .",
    "uniform gravitational fields are equivalent to frames that accelerate uniformly relative to inertial frames .",
    "this is the _ principle of equivalence _ between gravity and acceleration .",
    "the principle just stated is known as the _ weak equivalence principle _ because it only refers to gravity .    in treating the motion of a particle in the presence of gravity",
    ", we define the _ christoffel symbol _ or the _ affine connection _ as @xmath143 @xmath144 plays the same role for the gravitational field as the field strength tensor does for the electromagnetic field . using the definition of affine connection ,",
    "we can obtain the expression for the covariant derivative of a tensor : @xmath145 it is straightforward to conclude that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor vanishes .",
    "the concept of `` parallel transport '' of a vector has important implications .",

    "all the basic laws of physics , beyond those governing freely - falling particles adapt to the curvature of space - time ( that is , to the presence of gravity ) when we are working in riemannian normal coordinates .",
