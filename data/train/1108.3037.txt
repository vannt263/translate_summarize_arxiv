    "as it is well known , the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system must be bounded from below due to stability requirements and , as a consequence , there is no self - adjoint time operator canonically conjugated to the hamiltonian @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) , hence posing serious difficulties to define a meaningful time scale for quantum phenomena such as tunneling .",
    "several approaches have been considered to circumvent the above difficulty , leading to many definitions of quantum tunneling time , among which the dwell time and the phase time are the most prominent ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , the time scales proposed until now are generally plagued by difficulties which prevent their interpretation as a traversal time in the general case .",
    "for instance , a serious controversy in the interpretation of many such time scales is related to the hartman effect , which asserts that in the stationary case the time saturates for a static opaque potential @xcite ( also see @xcite for a generalized version ) .",
    "however , one can not properly address the problem of quantum tunneling time in the stationary case because the very concept of a particle having a definite tunneling time requires that it be represented by a _",
    "localized _ wave packet ( see , for example , @xcite ) . with this in mind , in this work we reexamine the tunneling of a wave packet through a static potential by using the quantum clock formalism introduced by salecker and wigner @xcite and further refined by peres @xcite .",
    "our main concern here is to scrutinize whether the hartman effect , both in its original and generalized versions , emerges or not for a wave packet .",
    "the salecker - wigner - peres ( swp ) clock @xcite ( see also @xcite ) consists of a quantum rotor weakly coupled to the system ( the tunneling particle ) , and it can be shown to be equivalent to the larmor clock @xcite , prepared and observed in a particular set of states , in the limit of large spin  for a detailed treatment see @xcite . in this framework a  time operator \" ( not canonically conjugated to the hamiltonian ) can be defined @xcite , and the application of such an operator to quantum tunneling was extensively analyzed by leavens and mckinnon @xcite , who found that its expectation value only produces a meaningful result after a calibration procedure is adopted for the clock readings .",
    "recently , park @xcite considered the one - dimensional scattering of a wave packet by a rectangular potential barrier and found that the expectation value of that  time operator \" in the asymptotic final states gives the dwell time averaged with respect to the components of the initial wave packet , which , however , can not be considered a traversal time because it does not distinguish between transmitted and reflected particles @xcite .    in this paper , instead of associating the clock readings to expectation values of such a  time operator \" , we follow peres approach in the study of the time of flight @xcite . according to this method the transmission ( reflection ) time , which is obtained by following the peak of the clock s wave function , is given by the time derivative of the phase shift of the transmission ( reflection ) amplitude with respect to the perturbation potential .",
    "we argue that in order to address the question of the time spent in the barrier region by a particle that is _ eventually transmitted _ ( _ reflected _ ) one _ must _ perform a _",
    "post - selection _ of the final state . then , making use of an _ asymptotic condition _ ensuring that for asymptotic times the incident and the transmitted / reflected wave packets are well localized far from the potential , it is possible to trace out the particle s degrees of freedom in order to  read \" the clock s final state .",
    "the average times obtained through this procedure are shown to have sensible physical properties in the context of quantum tunneling of gaussian wave packets through static symmetric potentials .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ clock ]",
    "we briefly review the formalism introduced by peres @xcite and its generalization to the time dependent situation ( also see @xcite ) , introducing the necessary steps to take into account only particles that are eventually transmitted ( reflected ) by the potential .",
    "we discuss some properties of the average times obtained and compare them with other time scales suggested in the literature . in section [ tun ]",
    "we study the behavior of these average times for the scattering of a gaussian wave packet , centered around a tunneling wave number , by a single rectangular barrier and a double delta barrier , with emphasis on the opaque regime and the possible emergence of the hartman effect and , in particular , its generalized version . in section [ concl ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the salecker - wigner clock @xcite , as considered by peres @xcite , is just a quantum rotor with hamiltonian given by @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the time resolution of the clock and @xmath3 is the dimension of the hilbert space ( with @xmath4 being a non - negative integer or half - integer ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 have eigenvalues @xmath8 with @xmath9 . a more convenient orthogonal basis for the clock is given by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite @xmath12 which has the advantage of having a sharp peak at @xmath13 for large @xmath14 , so that the clock s pointer indicates the @xmath15th  hour \" ( with uncertainty @xmath16 ) .",
    "under time evolution such states change as @xmath17 , thus making possible to associate a time duration @xmath18 to an arbitrary interval just by observing the translation of the peak of a free clock s wave function @xmath19 in that interval .",
    "we are interested in measuring the time associated with the one - dimensional scattering of a particle of mass @xmath20 by a ( real ) static potential @xmath21 confined to the region @xmath22 .",
    "following @xcite , the particle and the clock are coupled through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 where the projection operator @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 if @xmath26 $ ] and equals zero otherwise .",
    "the clock is assumed to be initially at the state @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the general form of the initial wave function of the whole system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a wave packet corresponding to a particle incident from the left of the potential which , from the symmetries of the problem @xcite , can be written as @xmath30 with all integrals in @xmath31 going from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the fourier coefficient @xmath34 is assumed to be centered around a positive @xmath35 corresponding to a tunneling energy .",
    "after the scattering the particle and the clock become entangled due to the interaction @xmath36 and the general form of the wave function is @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38    the wave function @xmath39 satisfies the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "the orthogonality of the @xmath41 s , together with the fact that they are eigenfunctions of @xmath7 , imply that @xmath42 satisfy the time - independent schrdinger equation for energy @xmath43 and potential @xmath44 where @xmath45 . in order to ensure a weak coupling between the clock and the system it is assumed that @xmath46 is a small perturbation , i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since we are interested in measuring the transmission time asymptotically after the interaction , let us focus on the transmitted wave packet .",
    "the solution of the above stationary problem in the region to the right of the potential @xmath49 is @xmath50 by using the weak coupling condition we can assume that @xmath51 and expand the phase @xmath52 up to first order in @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the phase of the transmission coefficient corresponding to the unperturbed potential @xmath21 . finally , substituting the above expressions in ( [ coupled])-([wavepackm ] ) , and using the explicit form of the functions @xmath41 , the asymptotic transmitted wave function is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the transmission time used by peres in @xcite .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained for the reflection time @xmath57 in terms of the reflection phase @xmath58 .",
    "it can be _ proved _ that these _ clock times _ satisfy @xcite ( also see @xcite ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for the stationary dwell time @xcite , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the transmission and reflection amplitudes , respectively .",
    "it is important to stress that , for the clock times used here , the above relation can be proved to be a _ direct consequence _ of schrdinger s equation .",
    "thus the criticism to such a relation for supposedly not being compatible with quantum mechanics due to the absence of an interference term , which sometimes appear in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , does not apply to the present case ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noticed that , in order to strictly enforce the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the integral in ( [ psi_tr ] ) should in principle be truncated by a small cutoff excluding the regions in which these conditions are not warranted .",
    "however , the continuity of the integrand allow us to extend the integration over the whole @xmath31-space up to first order for a very small @xmath46 , consistent with the approximations in ( [ 1order ] ) .",
    "this requires a large time resolution @xmath2 for the clock , since it is related to the reciprocal of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "however , as observed by davies @xcite , there is no difficulty since the clock can be treated within the weak measurement theory of aharonov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and a precise value can be obtained for a large enough ensemble .",
    "here we are interested in finding an average _ transmission _ time .",
    "therefore , we must consider only the sub - ensemble of all scattered particles that are eventually transmitted , i.e. , we must perform a _",
    "post - selection _ of the final state ( in addition to the _ pre - selection _ of the initial one ) .",
    "the post - selected ( transmitted ) state can be described , with a slight change in notation , by the density matrix of the particle - clock asymptotic state @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a normalization constant and @xmath65 corresponds to the state ( [ psi_tr ] ) . in order to observe the final state of the clock",
    "we assume an _ asymptotic condition _ , stating that long after the interaction the transmitted wave packet is completely localized to the right of the potential .",
    "then , we can trace out the particle s degrees of freedom ( by extending the @xmath66-integral over the whole space ) and obtaining the clock s reduced density matrix for the transmitted sub - ensemble , given by @xmath67 where the normalization requirement @xmath68 implies @xmath69 .    now , since the clock s reading is associated with the peak of its wave function , we _ define _ the _ average transmission time _ as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is an operator giving the peak of @xmath72 @xcite . then , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability density to find mode @xmath31 in the final transmitted wave packet . an analogous procedure for the reflected sub - ensemble results in the _ average reflection time _ : @xmath75 with @xmath76 the corresponding probability density to find mode @xmath31 in the reflected wave packet .    in the special case of a very sharply peaked wave packet , @xmath77 , definitions ( [ time - av])-([time - avr ] )",
    "reduce to the corresponding stationary times , as expected .",
    "however , for more physical incident wave packets , which necessarily involve a finite dispersion in wave numbers , these definitions have the important property of weighting the contribution of each @xmath78 ( @xmath57 ) by the _ probability density of having the mode @xmath31 in the final transmitted ( reflected ) wave packet _",
    ", thus minimizing the contributions of modes leading to the most improbable results .",
    "this is in contradistinction with the approach of considering the density matrix of the transmitted and reflected wave packets together , which is equivalent to averaging the dwell time with respect to the initial wave packet components  a procedure that leads to many well known difficulties @xcite .    the expressions ( [ time - av])-([time - avr ] ) coincide with the real part of the _ complex time _ obtained by leavens and aers @xcite in their analysis of double barrier resonant times using the larmor clock ( see also @xcite which deals with similar averages for the time obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "these definitions could also be inferred from the analysis of the larmor clock by falck and hauge @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the above treatment ( in which only the position of the clock s pointer is observed @xcite ) is that it introduces a unique _ real _ time scale , thus avoiding the problem of interpreting complex times .",
    "the above average reflection and transmission times can be used to generalize relation ( [ rel ] ) for a wave packet .",
    "first , we observe that the asymptotic probability to find the particle in the region at the right of the potential ( i.e. , the total probability for the particle to be transmitted ) is given by @xmath79 . under the asymptotic condition stated above the @xmath66-integration can be extended to the whole space and this probability reduces to @xmath80 analogously , assuming a similar asymptotic condition stating that long after the interaction the reflected wave packet is completely localized to the left of the potential , the total probability for the particle to be reflected is @xmath81 . from the normalization of the initial wave packet",
    "these probabilities satisfy @xmath82 ( as required , since long after the interaction transmission and reflection are complementary outcomes ) .",
    "then , defining the mean dwell time as @xcite @xmath83 where the overbar indicates averages over the _ initial _ wave packet , the above definitions , combined with ( [ rel ] ) , imply that @xmath84 this relation says that the usually defined average of the dwell time over the initial wave packet ( which does not take into account whether the particle is eventually reflected or transmitted ) can be viewed as an average over the transmission and reflection average times , weighted by the total probabilities for transmission and reflection , respectively .",
    "it must be stressed that _ a necessary requirement _ for this interpretation is that the _ asymptotic conditions be satisfied_. relation ( [ dwell - av ] ) appears as the real part of a similar _ complex _ relation in @xcite  again , the advantage here is that the swp clock provides only real times .",
    "in this section we study the average transmission time for a gaussian wave packet incident from the left on two kinds of symmetric localized potentials , namely a single rectangular barrier and the double delta barrier . in both cases ,",
    "we shall be mainly concerned with the behavior of @xmath85 in the regime of opaque barriers ( characterized by very small transmission amplitudes for non resonant tunneling energies ) , in order to examine the emergence or not of the hartman effect @xcite ( single barrier ) and its generalized version @xcite ( double delta barrier ) .",
    "we assume that at @xmath86 the particle is in a state described by a right - moving gaussian wave packet centered around a tunneling wave number @xmath87 , and spatially centered around a position @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a scale measuring the spatial extent of the initial wave packet ( its inverse is proportional to the wave packet s momentum dispersion ) .",
    "in what follows we will always make use of the fact that , as a consequence of ( [ rel ] ) , for symmetric potentials @xmath78 and @xmath57 coincide with the dwell time @xmath60 @xcite . therefore , the average times ( [ time - av ] ) and ( [ time - avr ] ) are just the dwell time averaged over the transmitted and reflected sub - ensembles , respectively .",
    "let us now consider a square potential barrier of height @xmath91 and width @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "for a tunneling incident energy , @xmath94 , the stationary dwell time is well known and given by @xcite @xmath95}{\\left [ 4q^2k^2 + ( q^2-k^2)^2 \\tanh^2(qa)\\right]}\\ , , \\label{tc1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for energies above the barrier",
    ", @xmath98 , the stationary dwell time can be obtained from the above expression through the substitution @xmath99 , with @xmath100 ) , while the transmission amplitude @xmath61 can be found in any textbook on quantum mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the opaque limit , characterized by @xmath101 for a given @xmath102 , the stationary dwell time ( [ tc1b ] )",
    "becomes independent of the barrier width @xmath92 , which is the hartman effect @xcite .",
    "this effect has been at the origin of an intense debate in the recent literature concerning , among other problems , the apparent superluminality of the tunneling process ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . it should be noticed that a time can be defined , based on an analogy with fluid mechanics @xcite , such that in the _ stationary case _ it reduces to the dwell time divided by the transmission coefficient and , therefore , does not saturate with the barrier width @xcite ( also see @xcite ) ; but a complete analysis of _ time dependent _ tunneling using such time scale is yet to be achieved @xcite .    in figure 1",
    "we investigate the typical behavior of the average times ( [ time - av ] ) and ( [ time - avr ] ) with increasing barrier widths . for comparison",
    "we have also plotted the average reflection time ( [ time - avr ] ) , the mean dwell time ( [ dwell - av1 ] ) , and the time spent by the incident packet ( characterized by its peak wavelength @xmath35 ) in the region @xmath103 $ ] in the absence of the potential , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "the choice of parameters in these figures ensures that the initial wave packet ( [ psi0 ] ) is , to an excellent approximation , confined to the left of the barrier ( at @xmath86 the probability to find the particle in the region @xmath105 is less than @xmath106 ) . also , tunneling components are dominant in the fourier decomposition of the initial wave packet .",
    "we observe that in the extreme opaque regime ( in this case characterized by very large barrier widths ) , while @xmath107 saturates to a value independent of @xmath92 , @xmath108 increases linearly with the barrier width . in the inset , showing in detail the region of small to moderate barrier widths , we observe that for thin barriers all the average times are very similar . the similarity between @xmath108 and @xmath109 [ hence , from ( [ dwell - av ] ) , their similarity with @xmath110 is expected , since for thin barriers the post - selected probability density distributions @xmath111 and @xmath112 are almost indistinguishable from the incident one , @xmath113 . as the barrier thickness increases @xmath114 becomes smaller than the free time and soon saturates , as expected for a wave packet centered in a tunneling wave number , since one would anticipate that the wave function can not penetrate beyond a certain barrier depth .",
    "the average transmission time , @xmath108 , also becomes smaller than the free time for intermediate values of the barrier width , indicating that the barrier speeds up the wave packet in the transmission channel ; however , in the very opaque region its behavior suffers an abrupt change , growing suddenly until it attains a regime of linear growth  as shown for large @xmath92 s in fig . 1",
    ", in this regime @xmath115 ( the wave packet width exerts an important role in determining the values of @xmath92 for which this abrupt change occurs , with the barrier width for that change increasing with @xmath90 ; for a similar conclusion using a different time average see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we observe that @xmath108 _ never saturates _ , as one would expect of a well defined average transmission time .",
    "finally , as it is well known , the mean dwell time initially increases with @xmath92 and soon saturates ( the hartman effect ) ; this is a consequence of the fact that in the opaque region @xmath116 and the reflection term dominates the r.h.s of eq .",

    "[ fig1],width=359,height=207 ]    it is instructive to compare the _ qualitative _ behavior of the average times shown in fig . [ fig1 ] with the results presented in @xcite , even though @xcite considers the time _",

    "however , there are important differences : in @xcite the reflection time starts from infinite for @xmath124 and it is very large for very small barrier widths before staurating ; furthermore , in @xcite the transmission time tends to increase exponentially with @xmath92 in the extreme opaque limit ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "these are unexpected properties and there is some debate about the interpretation of these times @xcite ( nevertheless , the transmission dwell time used in @xcite has been shown to have practical use in the study of the half life of radioactive nuclei decaying by the emission of an @xmath64-particle @xcite ) . by contrast",
    ", @xmath114 is small for small barrier widths , a plausible result since this time is interpreted as the average time spent into the potential region by the wave packet which is eventually reflected .",
    "in addition , @xmath125 tends to increase _ linearly _ with @xmath92 in the extreme opaque limit .",
    "such good properties of @xmath125 and @xmath114 emerge as a consequence of averaging over pos - selected sub - ensembles .",
    "the behavior of the average transmission time observed in fig .",
    "1 is a consequence of the fact that for the transmitted wave packet in the opaque regime @xmath126 is dominated by above the barrier components . if one truncates wave packet to include only under the barrier components , the corresponding  truncated \" transmitted wave packet is dominated by the contribution of a single component , completely lacking localizability in the opaque limit and approaching a plane wave and , therefore , saturating [ but in this case , strictly speaking , the definition ( [ time - av ] ) does not apply ] . the above the barrier dominance",

    "fig ( _ a _ ) corresponds to the range of small to moderate barrier widths ( in which we used a log scale for the vertical axis ) .",
    "( _ b _ ) shows a wide range of barrier widths [ we have multiplied all the times , except @xmath126 , by a convenient factor ( @xmath165 ) , in order to display all the curves in the same plot ] .",

    "we considered the extension of the swp clock to treat the one - dimensional tunneling of a particle , represented by a wave packet , through a static potential and addressed the question of how much time a particle that is eventually transmitted ( reflected ) spends in the potential region .",
    "taking into account that to properly analyze this question one must consider only the sub - ensemble of the scattered particles that are finally transmitted ( reflected ) , which corresponds to a post - selection of the final state , the swp clock attributes a well - defined average time for these process , namely eqs .",
    "( [ time - av ] ) and ( [ time - avr ] ) .",
    "these are to be compared with the mean dwell time obtained in @xcite for the swp clock .",
    "that @xmath166 and @xmath167 are good candidates to transmission and reflection times also follows from the fact that they naturally satisfy the generalization of the  weighted average rule \" @xcite for the time dependent case [ eq . ( [ dwell - av ] ) ] , provided the asymptotic conditions are satisfied . also , the above approach has the advantage of providing these average values as the only time scale , in contradistinction with previous treatments of the larmor clock in which they appear as the real part of a complex time @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the properties of the average transmission and reflection times for the scattering of a gaussian wave packet , centered on a tunneling wave number , by a square barrier and a double delta barrier and found that they would deviate from the mean dwell time only when the transmission or the reflection coefficients were very small [ for symmetric potentials @xmath78 and @xmath57 equal the stationary dwell time and the average times ( [ time - av ] ) and ( [ time - avr ] ) are an average dwell time weighted by the transmission and reflection probability density , respectively ] .",
    "then , by carefully considering the opaque limit we found that @xmath168 shows no evidence of either the hartman effect @xcite ( single barrier ) or its generalized version @xcite ( double delta barrier ) , and it also shows that the tunneling particle is slowed down by extremely opaque barriers .",
    "these properties indicate that @xmath168 is a good candidate for an average transmission time .",
    "it should also be noticed that our conclusions concerning the emergence of the generalized hartman effect are in disagreement with those of @xcite ( who used a different definition for the average transmission time ) _ in the region of small barrier spacing _",
    ", for they claim the existence of such effect for a wave packet as long as the width @xmath169 of the wave packet is much smaller than the spacing between resonances , while our results for @xmath170 show that the generalized hartman effect does not emerge in _ any _ region of the parameters .",
    "we stress that _ average _ tunneling times are the most one can expect due to the lack of a well defined time operator and the consequent impossibility to obtain an eigenvalue for time .",
    "the above analysis shows that the saturation of the transmission time , a feature associated with the hartman effect , is a consequence of not taking into account the fact that the definition of a meaningful traversal time associated to a tunneling particle requires localizability , a requirement impossible to be satisfied in the stationary case .",
    "in addition , it is also a consequence of not taking the probability of transmission into account properly .    it should be noticed that even though the average transmission time does not saturate , for intermediate barrier widths @xmath170 increases very slowly with @xmath92 ( single barrier ) or @xmath129 ( double delta ) , so that the transmitted wave packet  speeds up \" in comparison to the free wave packet ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "although this phenomenon is well - known @xcite , it could be interpreted as a  remnant \" of the hartman effect and it deserves further investigation ( in the realm of relativistic quantum mechanics ) due to the fact that it could allow for ( non - causal ) superluminal average speeds in this range of barrier widths .",
    "finally , given the sensible properties exhibited by the average times @xmath167 and @xmath171 , it would be interesting to consider its possible application to the analysis of quantum tunneling in graphene , a field of much current interest and in which many of the issues discussed in this paper are of practical relevance ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , including the controversy around the hartman effect @xcite .",
