    ", the non - thermal proton energy fraction may be low ( but see giannios 2010 ) , while in the baryon - dominated outflow model , it is natural to expect proton acceleration via shock dissipation of the kinetic energy . since the flux of neutrinos depends on the energy fraction of protons in the fireball for a given burst energy , the flux or limit of the neutrino emission could constrain the proton energy fraction and in principal",

    "furthermore , the flux level predicted by our modified analytical calculation is a factor of @xmath114 lower than that obtained by icc ( abbasi et al . , 2011 ) .",

'' ] is shown by the blue solid line in figure 1 , where the middle of equation ( a.15 ) in their paper is used assuming the bolometric luminosity as the luminosity at the break energy .",

    "of course , the suppression factor is different for grbs with different parameters .",
    "besides the baryon resonance , the direct pion process , multi - pion process and the diffractive scattering also contribute to the total @xmath131 cross section .",

    "although this simplified numerical approach is different from more detailed , fully numerical calculations ( murase @xmath8 nagataki 2006a , b ; murase 2007 ; baerward et al .",
    "2011 ) , it is enough for our purpose and saves calculation time .    in figure 1 , we also show this numerical result ( the red solid line ) for comparison .",

    "we note that , when the emission radius is too small , the maximum energy of accelerating particles is limited due to strong photohadronic and/or radiation cooling , and neutrino emission can be more complicated due to strong pion / muon cooling , so a more careful study is needed to obtain quantitative constrains on @xmath74 in this regime . on the other hand , the larger dissipation radius leads to lower neutrino flux and higher cooling break energy according to equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
