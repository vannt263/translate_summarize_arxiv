    "<S> we study two - flavor collective neutrino oscillations in the dense - neutrino region above the neutrino sphere in a supernova ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential causes `` multi - angle '' effects that can lead either to complete kinematical decoherence in flavor space or only to small differences between different trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> this nonlinear system switches abruptly between `` self - maintained coherence '' and `` self - induced decoherence '' among the angular modes , depending on the strength of the deleptonization flux . </S>",
    "<S> for a realistic sn the quasi single - angle behavior is probably typical , simplifying the numerical treatment and probably allowing for the survival of observational features of flavor oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> the neutrinos streaming off a collapsed supernova ( sn ) core are so dense near the neutrino sphere that they produce a significant refractive effect for each other , leading to collective oscillation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the practical importance of these nonlinear phenomena was only recently recognized and studied in a series of papers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an introduction was given at this conference by eligio  lisi  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the sn neutrino fluxes are thought to obey the hierarchy @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for any of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , there is an excess of @xmath6 pairs relative to @xmath7 . in an inverted hierarchy situation , </S>",
    "<S> this pair excess converts collectively into @xmath7 pairs , a process that does not violate flavor - lepton number and thus does not require mixing : it could also proceed as an ordinary pair annihilation process . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino refraction causes this pair process to proceed collectively and very fast , almost independently of the mixing angle , i.e. , we have to do with a collective `` speed - up effect ''  @xcite . the unpaired @xmath8 excess flux from deleptonization is conserved  @xcite . in the adiabatic limit , it is the low - energy part of the @xmath8 spectrum that survives , leading to a step - like feature in the @xmath8 spectrum ( a `` spectral split ''  @xcite caused by a `` step - wise spectral swapping ''  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of these effects happen in the dense - neutrino region that typically extends from the neutrino sphere out to a few hundred kilometers . </S>",
    "<S> if the ordinary msw resonances occur at larger radii , the collective phenomena and subsequent msw transformations are independent , the former producing the initial condition for the latter . for an inverted hierarchy </S>",
    "<S> the only effect of matter in the collective - transformation region is a decrease of the effective mixing angle  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if the matter density profile is very shallow , the ordinary msw effect can prepare the initial condition for the collective effects  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> mixed neutrinos are described by matrices of density @xmath9 and @xmath10 for each ( anti)neutrino mode . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal entries are the usual occupation numbers whereas the off - diagonal terms encode phase information . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are @xmath11 $ ] , where the hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 being the velocity . in the mass basis , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix of vacuum oscillation frequencies is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the matter effect is represented , in the weak interaction basis , by @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> for antineutrinos the only difference is @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective tau - lepton density @xmath17 arises from radiative corrections  @xcite and can be important in a genuine three - flavor treatment of ordinary  @xcite or collective  @xcite sn neutrino oscillations . for the latter , the influence of @xmath18 can be rather sensitive to deviations from maximal 23-mixing .    the angular factor @xmath19 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) derives from the current - current nature of the weak - interaction hamiltonian . in an isotropic ensemble it averages to unity , whereas the neutrinos streaming off a sn core are strongly non - isotropic so that different angular modes experience a different strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential </S>",
    "<S> . one may expect that this effect leads to kinematical decoherence among angular modes and thus to flavor equilibrium  @xcite . in a symmetric ensemble with equal densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos , this is indeed the case . such a system is highly unstable in that an infinitesimal deviation from exact isotropy is enough to trigger an exponential run - away towards flavor equilibrium  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a numerical simulation of the flavor evolution of sn neutrinos revealed that multi - angle effects were small : all angular modes evolved nearly collectively , very similar to an isotropic ensemble  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , in a multi - energy system every energy mode feels a different hamiltonian , yet the evolution is collective , i.e. , multi - energy effects do not lead to kinematical decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a numerical exploration of multi - angle effects in a spherically symmetric system where the neutrinos are emitted from a `` neutrino sphere ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified the asymmetry between the @xmath8 and @xmath20 flux as the crucial parameter . </S>",
    "<S> realistic deleptonization fluxes in sne seem sufficient to suppress multi - angle decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in practice multi - angle effects seem to be a subdominant feature of collective sn transformations .    a better understanding of collective oscillations can be developed in the two - flavor case in terms of the usual flavor polarization vectors @xmath21 to express the matrices @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are @xmath22 . ignoring the ordinary matter effect , the `` hamiltonian '' is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unit vector in flavor space in the `` mass direction '' and @xmath25 the vacuum oscillation frequency . in an isotropic situation where the velocity terms average to zero , </S>",
    "<S> the second term is of the form @xmath26 where the vector @xmath27 is the difference between the total neutrino and antineutrino polarization vectors and @xmath28 the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> the individual @xmath29 all lie in a single plane . in the adiabatic limit </S>",
    "<S> the polarization vectors follow the hamiltonians so that they also lie in this co - rotating plane . </S>",
    "<S> this observation explains the collective nature of the multi - energy evolution ( all polarization vectors stay in the same plane that rotates around @xmath30 with a certain frequency @xmath31 ) and explains the spectral splits in that the final @xmath32 in the co - rotating plane are either aligned or anti - aligned with @xmath30  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this picture also illustrates a crucial difference to the symmetric system where initially @xmath33 and the overall evolution is purely pendular  @xcite  there is no co - rotating plane .    in a spherically symmetric situation </S>",
    "<S> every mode is characterized by its vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath34 and its angle @xmath35 relative to the radial direction , providing @xmath36 as the radial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> now the individual hamiltonians are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the flux term of the neutrino ensemble , i.e. , the same as @xmath27 , but every mode weighted with @xmath39 . if all polarization vectors lie in a single plane , then also all @xmath32 are in that plane so that an evolution in a co - rotating plane is self - consistently possible . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that those cases with little kinematical decoherence correspond to the polarization vectors essentially staying in a co - rotating plane with some zenith - angle spread . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the vectors @xmath24 , @xmath27 and @xmath38 do not have to stay in a single plane and in fact , this appears to be an unstable arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> kinematical multi - angle decoherence corresponds to strong deviations from this coplanar situation . in a spherically symmetric situation , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength decreases with @xmath40 . in a toy model with an artificially slow decrease of @xmath41 one </S>",
    "<S> can make the evolution arbitrarily slow and adiabatic . in this case </S>",
    "<S> multi - angle decoherence appears to be unavoidable .    </S>",
    "<S> it appears that in a realistic sn the collective evolution is slow enough to be essentially adiabatic with regard to the development of a spectral split , but fast enough that the co - planar arrangement of the polarization vectors survives . </S>",
    "<S> this picture may provide the key to an analytic understanding of the conditions for multi - angle kinematical decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of spherical symmetry of the overall system severely restricts possible solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is a one - dimensional problem along the radial direction . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be studied if this symmetry has an important impact on kinematical decoherence , i.e. , if a system with fewer symmetries would decohere more easily .    </S>",
