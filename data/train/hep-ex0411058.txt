    "@xmath0 violation in the flavor - changing @xmath14 transitions is sensitive to physics at a very high - energy scale .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that large deviations from standard model ( sm ) expectations are allowed for time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath15 meson decays  @xcite .",
    "belle s previous measurement of the @xmath16 decay , which is dominated by the @xmath17 transition , yielded a value that differs from the sm expectation by 3.5 standard deviations  @xcite .",
    "measurements with a larger data sample are required to elucidate this difference .",
    "it is also essential to examine additional modes that may be sensitive to the same @xmath14 penguin amplitude .    in the sm ,",
    "@xmath0 violation arises from an irreducible phase , the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase , in the weak - interaction quark - mixing matrix .",
    "in particular , the sm predicts @xmath0 asymmetries in the time - dependent rates for @xmath15 and @xmath18 decays to a @xmath0 eigenstate @xmath19 . in the decay chain @xmath20 , where one of the @xmath13 mesons decays at time @xmath21 to a final state @xmath22 and",

    "the sm predicts @xmath36 , where @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath0-even ( -odd ) final states , and @xmath38 for both @xmath39 and @xmath40 transitions .",
    "possible contribution from @xmath41 tree transition is estimated to be in the range from few per cent to about ten per cent depending on the final state  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we neglect @xmath41 contribution .",
    "another class of decays that proceed via the penguin transition is radiative @xmath42 decays . within the sm ,",
    "the photon emitted from a @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) meson is dominantly right - handed ( left - handed ) .",
    "therefore the polarization of the photon carries information on the original @xmath33-flavor ; the decay is thus almost flavor - specific .",
    "the sm predicts a small asymmetry @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the @xmath33-quark ( @xmath46-quark ) mass  @xcite .",
    "any significant deviation from this expectation would be a manifestation of physics beyond the sm .",
    "recently belle and babar measured time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath47 and related decay modes , which are governed by the @xmath39 transition , and already determined @xmath48 rather precisely ; the present world average value is @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this serves as a firm reference point for the sm .",
    "our previous measurements for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath5 were based on a 140  fb@xmath52 data sample ( ds - i ) with @xmath53 @xmath10 pairs  @xcite . in this report , we describe improved measurements incorporating an additional 113  fb@xmath52 data sample that contains @xmath54 @xmath10 pairs ( ds - ii ) for a total of @xmath9 @xmath10 pairs .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and",
    "a 3-layer silicon vertex detector ( svd - i ) were used for ds - i , while a 1.5 cm radius beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector ( svd - ii ) and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used for ds - ii  @xcite .    in this update",
    "we include additional @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath5 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 subdecay modes that were not used in the previous analysis .",
    "we also perform new measurements of @xmath0 asymmetries for the following @xmath0-eigenstate @xmath15 decay modes : @xmath59 and @xmath4 for @xmath60 ; @xmath61 and @xmath7 for @xmath62 .",
    "the decays @xmath63 and @xmath64 are combined in this analysis by redefining @xmath27 as @xmath65 to take the opposite @xmath0 parities into account , and are collectively called `` @xmath66 '' .",
    "the @xmath0 asymmetries for the decay @xmath61 are measured for the first time .",
    "finally , we also measure time - dependent @xmath0 violation in the decay @xmath67 , which is not a @xmath0 eigenstate but is sensitive to physics beyond the sm .",
    "yet another final state that is not a @xmath0 eigenstate is @xmath51 . we find that the @xmath51 state is primarily @xmath68 ; a measurement of the @xmath68 fraction with ds - i gives @xmath69  @xcite . in the following determination of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "we fix @xmath68 for this mode .",
    "we determine @xmath27 and @xmath28 for each mode by performing an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the observed @xmath70 distribution .",
    "the probability density function expected for the signal distribution , is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : psig ] ) incorporating the effect of incorrect flavor assignment .",
    "the distribution is convolved with the proper - time interval resolution function , which takes into account the finite vertex resolution .    for the decays @xmath71 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath13 vertex reconstruction technique is validated using @xmath72 events where the @xmath13 decay vertex is reconstructed with @xmath73 and the ip constraint rather than charged tracks from @xmath74",
    ". a cp fit to the @xmath72 sample gives @xmath75(stat ) and @xmath76(stat ) , which are in good agreement with the world average values .",
    "thus , we conclude that the vertex resolution for the @xmath71 and @xmath67 decays is well understood .",
    "the only free parameters in the final fit are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "figures  [ fig : asym](a - c ) show the raw asymmetries for some channels .",
    "note that these projections onto the @xmath80 axis do not take into account event - by - event information ( such as the signal fraction , the wrong tag fraction and the vertex resolution ) , which is used in the unbinned maximum - likelihood fit .",
    "various crosschecks of the measurement are performed .",
    "we reconstruct charged @xmath13 meson decays that are the counterparts of the @xmath81 decays and apply the same fit procedure .",

    "lifetime measurements are also performed for the @xmath19 modes and the corresponding charged @xmath13 decay modes .",
    "the fits yield @xmath29 and @xmath82 values consistent with the world - average values . mc pseudo - experiments are generated for each decay mode to perform ensemble tests .",
    "we find that the statistical errors obtained in our measurements are all consistent with the expectations from the ensemble tests .",
    "for the @xmath66 decay , a fit to ds - i alone yields @xmath83(stat ) and @xmath84(stat ) , while a fit to ds - ii alone yields @xmath85(stat ) and @xmath86(stat ) .",
    "note that the results for ds - i differ from our previously published results  @xcite @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as decays @xmath89 and @xmath90 are included in this analysis . from mc pseudo - experiments , the probability that the difference between @xmath27 values in ds - i and ds - ii is larger than the observed one ( 1.46 )",
    "is estimated to be 4.5% .",
    "as all the other checks also yield results consistent with expectations , we conclude that the difference in @xmath91 between the two datasets is due to a statistical fluctuation .    averaging the result of @xmath27 measurement for all the @xmath92 channels ( except @xmath93 ) ,",
