    "the recent precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb hereafter ) temperature anisotropies released by the planck collaboration @xcite are providing the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters to date @xcite .    in this paper , we use this new dataset to constrain two parameters that affect the cmb  damping tail \" regime , at small angular scales , namely the neutrino effective number @xmath0 and the lensing amplitude @xmath1 , that , from previous experiments , have been reported as not consistent with the standard expectations @xcite .",
    "we remind here that @xmath0 effectively measures the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination and is related to the energy density in relativistic ",
    "dark \" particles @xmath7 by :    @xmath8 \\rho_\\gamma\\ , ,   \\label{eq : neffdef}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the cmb photon energy density , with value today @xmath10 g@xmath11 .    in the standard scenario , assuming three relativistic neutrino families , the expected value is @xmath12 .",
    "observation of a different value could point to new physics , related to the neutrino sector , such as non standard neutrino decoupling , sterile neutrinos , etc . , or to even more exotic physics , such as axions , extra dimensions , early dark energy ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .    on the other hand , the @xmath1 parameter is a phenomenological parameter introduced in @xcite , that simply rescales the lensing potential : @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the power spectrum of the lensing field .",
    "the expected value for this parameter in the standard framework is @xmath15 .",
    "a value different from one could indicate either the presence of a systematic , or the presence of new physics ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the previous cmb measurements obtained by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , @xcite ) and the south pole telescope ( spt , @xcite ) , when combined with the latest observations from the wmap satellite ( wmap9 , @xcite ) , have indeed provided different values for these two parameters , that are in tension at the level of two standard deviations .",
    "as showed in @xcite , the act dataset gives @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath4 c.l .",
    ", while the spt dataset gives @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath4 c.l ..    given this tension , it is certainly timely to investigate the constraints that can be obtained for @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the new data from the planck satellite .",
    "the planck collaboration has already presented results in @xcite on @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately . here",
    "we extend this analysis by varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously , i.e. taking into account the possible correlations between these two parameters as in @xcite , and by properly comparing the results with the previous act and spt measurements in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "our paper is simply organized as follows : in the next section we describe the analysis method , in section iii we present our results also considering baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) surveys and @xmath20 measurements , while in section iv we derive our conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             parameters plane . , width=302 ]    it is also interesting to note that the planck+wp dataset is in general in better agreement with the wmap9+spt dataset than the wmap9+act on most of the parameters as the hubble constant @xmath20 , the matter density @xmath21 and the scalar spectral index @xmath22 .",
    "this could appear as in contradiction with the results presented in @xcite where , on the contrary , a better agreement with the wmap9+act dataset was reported .",
    "the reason of this different conclusion is due to the fact that while in @xcite the comparison of planck with act and spt has been done by fixing @xmath15 , here we let this parameter to vary freely .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by the spt collaboration @xcite .      in this section",
    "we include the hst and bao datasets .",
    "we report the results obtained from the planck+wp+hst , planck+wp+bao and planck+wp+hst+bao analyses in the three columns of table [ plancktable ] , respectively . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we refer to the planck+wp dataset as  cmb \" .",
    "we show the 1-d posterior probability distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ 1d_planck ] and the 2-d confidence regions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ nnu - alens_planck ] for all the dataset combinations discussed : cmb+hst , cmb+bao and cmb+bao+hst .",
    "our results are in perfect agreement with those already presented in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the introduction of the bao dataset tends to drag down both the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. to a better consistency with the standard expectation ; on the other hand , the inclusion of the hst dataset preserves the planck+wp mean values of parameters , reducing the error bars and therefore increasing the hints for new physics .",
    "in particular , for the cmb+hst case , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 assume larger values at more than @xmath23 confidence level .",
    "when both bao and hst are combined , the final effect is to lower the value of @xmath24 , which however is still not in full agreement with the expected value of unity , and to lower the number of neutrinos species as well , giving @xmath25 , which also remains at almost @xmath26 away from the standard value .",
    "in this brief paper we have reported new joint constraints on the neutrino effective number @xmath0 and the cmb lensing amplitude @xmath1 from the new planck dataset .",
    "we have shown that the planck+wp dataset is hinting for both a presence of dark radiation ( at the level of @xmath5 ) and for an anomalous amplitude for the lensing parameter ( at the level of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the planck+wp constraints on @xmath0 and other parameters , such as the hubble constant and the matter density , are in very good agreement with those obtained from the wmap9+spt dataset .",
    "it is clearly worth to note that two very different datasets provide an indication for a larger value of the effective neutrino number . in general",
    ", we found a tension on the derived parameters between the planck+wp and the wmap9+act datasets .",
    "this clearly indicates that the inclusion of the act dataset in a combined planck+act has to be carefully considered .",
    "the anomalous lensing amplitude from planck+wp is more consistent with the results obtained from the wmap9+act dataset , which also provide a @xmath27 indication for a larger value .",
    "however , since the same signal is not found in the trispectrum analysis @xcite , the nature of this anomalous lensing amplitude needs further investigation .",
    "moreover , our analysis clearly demonstrates a correlation between @xmath1 and the main cosmological parameters .    the hints for new physics from the planck+wp dataset",
    "are confirmed when the hst measurements are included and are weakened when the bao dataset is considered .",
    "the cmb+hst+bao analysis also suggests the presence of anomalous values but at smaller statistical significance",
    ".    it will be probably duty of the next planck data release , with the full mission and polarization data , to provide more precise , cmb only , constraints on the neutrino number and the lensing amplitude and to confirm or falsify these current hints for new physics from planck .",
