    "the scrutiny of extensions on general relativity ( gr ) is a well motivated topic in cosmology .",
    "some phenomena , such as the current red accelerating expansion of the universe or gravitational singularities like the big bang , would presage extensions of gr in the infra - red as well as in the ultra - violet limits . among these extensions ,",
    "the eibi theory @xcite , which is constructed on a palatini formalism , is an appealing model in the sense that it is inspired by the born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite and the big bang singularity can be removed through a regular stage with a finite physical curvature @xcite .",
    "various important issues of the eibi theory have been addressed such as cosmological solutions @xcite , compact objects @xcite , cosmological perturbations @xcite , parameter constraints @xcite , and the quantization of the theory @xcite .",
    "however , some possible drawbacks of the theory were discovered in ref .",
    "finally , some interesting generalizations of the theory were proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as is known , the cause of the late time accelerating expansion of the universe can be resorted to phantom dark energy , which violates the null energy condition ( at least from a phenomenological point of view ) while remains consistent with observations so far .",
    "red nonetheless , the phantom energy may induce more cosmological singularities in gr .",
    "in particular there are three kinds of behaviors intrinsic to phantom models , which can be characterized by the behaviors of the scale factor @xmath0 , the hubble rate @xmath1 , and its cosmic derivatives @xmath2 near the singular points : ( a ) the big rip singularity ( br ) happens at a finite cosmic time @xmath3 when @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite , ( b ) the lr happens at @xmath7 when @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , ( c ) the lsbr happens at @xmath7 when @xmath4 , @xmath5 , while @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "all these three scenarios would lead to the universe to rip itself as all the structures in the universe would be destroyed no matter what kind of binding energy is involved .",
    "interestingly , even though the eibi theory can cure the big bang , in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that the br and lr are unavoidable in the eibi setup , hinting that the eibi theory is still not complete and some quantum treatments near these singular events may be necessary . in this paper , we will extend the investigations in ref .",
    "@xcite where we showed that the br in the eibi phantom model is expected to be cured in the context of quantum geometrodynamics .",
    "we will carry an analysis to encompass the rest of truly phantom dark energy abrupt events ; i.e. the lr and lsbr .",
    "the eibi action proposed in @xcite is ( from now on , we assume @xmath9 ) @xmath10+s_m(g),\\label{action1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the determinant of the tensor @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 characterizes the theory and @xmath14 quantifies the effective cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath15 is the matter lagrangian .",

    "@xmath25 is a rescaled time such that the auxiliary metric can be written in a flrw form .    in gr ,",
    "the lr and lsbr can be driven ( separately ) by two phantom energy models as follows @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive constants .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 where we take @xmath30 when @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the abrupt events happen at an infinite future where @xmath0 and @xmath18 diverge . inserting these phantom energy contents into the eibi model ,",
    "i.e. , eqs .   and , and considering the large @xmath0 limit ( for @xmath18 given in eqs .",
    ") , we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 for these two phantom energy models .",
    "therefore , the lr and lsbr of the physical metric are unavoidable within the eibi model while the auxiliary metric behaves as a de - sitter phase at late time .",
    "the deduction of the wdw equation of the eibi model is based on the construction of a classical hamiltonian that is promoted to a quantum operator .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this can be achieved more straightforwardly by considering an alternative action which is dynamically equivalent to the eibi action : @xmath34+s_m(g).\\label{action2}\\ ] ] in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the field equations obtained by varying the action with respect to @xmath16 and the auxiliary metric @xmath35 are the same to those derived from the action .",
    "starting from action and inserting the flrw ansatz , the lagrangian of this model in which matter field is described by a perfect fluid can be written as ( see ref .",

    "first , we choose the following factor ordering : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the wdw equation reads : @xmath47\\psi(a , x)=0 , \\label{wdw1}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{vv}\\ ] ] next , we rewrite the potential @xmath49 as @xmath50 , \\label{26}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 . near the classical singularity",
    "where @xmath4 , the behavior of the potential can be classified as follows :    * if @xmath52 diverges slower than @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , the second term in the bracket in is negligible compared with the first term .",
    "the remaining two terms are positive and blow up when @xmath0 and @xmath55 go simultaneously to infinity . *",
    "if @xmath52 diverges faster than @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath56 , the potential can be approximated as @xmath57 when @xmath0 goes to infinity . *",
    "if @xmath52 diverges comparably with @xmath53 , the potential can also be approximated as in eq .   because the phantom energy density blows up when @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we find that the potential @xmath49 goes to positive infinity when @xmath4 for all values of @xmath55 . with the help of the first order wkb approximation ( see the appendix ) , it can be easily proven that the wave function of the wdw equation vanishes when @xmath4 for all values of @xmath55 .      from the hamiltonian we can choose another factor ordering @xmath58 and",
    "rewrite the corresponding wdw equation by introducing a new variable @xmath59 as follows @xmath60\\psi(a , y)=0 , \\label{eqan}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , \\label{v1yy}\\ ] ] @xmath62 and @xmath42 is given in eqs .  .",
    "before proceeding further , we highlight that this quantization is based on the laplace - beltrami operator which is the laplacian operator in minisuperspace @xcite .",
    "this operator depends on the number of degrees of freedom involved . for the case of a single degree of freedom",
    ", it can be written as in eq .  .    the behavior of @xmath63 given in near the classical singularity where @xmath4 can be classified as follows :    * if @xmath52 diverges slower than @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 , the second term of @xmath63 is negligible compared with the first term .",
    "the remaining two terms are positive and blow up when @xmath0 and @xmath66 go simultaneously to infinity . *",
    "if @xmath52 diverges faster than @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath67 , the potential can be approximated as @xmath68 when @xmath0 goes to infinity . *",
    "if @xmath52 diverges comparably with @xmath64 , the potential can also be approximated as in eq .   because the phantom energy density blows up when @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we find that the potential @xmath63 goes to positive infinity when @xmath4 for all the values of @xmath66 .",
    "then , using again the wkb approximation ( cf . the appendix ) , we can claim that the wave function @xmath69 and @xmath70 vanish when @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , by assuming the validity of one of the field equations , which implies the dependence between @xmath0 and @xmath24 , we can obtain an approximated solution for the wave function without relying on a wkb approximation .",
    "near the lr singular event , the energy density @xmath18 behaves as @xmath71 . on that regime ,",
    "the dependence between the auxiliary scale factor @xmath24 and @xmath0 is @xmath72 . on the other hand , near the lsbr event the energy density behaves as @xmath73 and @xmath24 behaves as @xmath74 . for both cases",
    ", the wdw equation can be written as @xmath75 when @xmath55 and @xmath0 go to infinity .",
    "the wave function reads @xcite @xmath76 and consequently when @xmath77 , its asymptotic behavior reads @xcite @xmath78,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 here @xmath80 and @xmath81 are bessel function of the first kind and second kind , respectively .",
    "similarly , in both cases ( lr and lsbr ) the wdw equation can be written as @xmath82 when @xmath0 and @xmath66 approach infinity .",
    "the solution of the previous equation read @xcite @xmath83 and when @xmath84 , therefore , @xcite @xmath85.\\ ] ] consequently , the wave functions approach zero when @xmath0 goes to infinity . according to the dewitt criterium for singularity avoidance @xcite ,",
    "the lr and lsbr is expected to be avoided independently of the factor orderings considered in this work .",
    "we have shown that the dewitt criterium of singularity avoidance is fulfilled hinting that the universe would escape the lr and lsbr in the eibi model once the quantum effects are important .",
    "we next estimate the expected value of the scale factor of the universe @xmath0 by estimating the expected value of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason we have to resort to the expected value of @xmath24 rather than @xmath0 is that in the classical theory @xcite that we have quantized the dynamics is only endowed to the scale factor @xmath24 .",
    "we remind at this regard that when approaching the lr and lsbr , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , at least within the classical framework . therefore",
    "if the expected value of @xmath24 , which we will denote as @xmath88 , is finite , then we expect that the expected value of @xmath0 ; i.e. @xmath89 would be finite as well . therefore , non of the cosmological and geometrical divergences present at the lr and lsbr would take place .",
    "we next present a rough estimation for an upper limit of @xmath88 for the two quantization procedures presented on the previous subsection .",
    "* factor ordering i : + the expected value of @xmath24 at late - time can be estimated as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is large enough to ensure the validity of the approximated potential in ( [ difeq1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath54 . in this limit , we can use the asymptotic behavior for the wave function c.f .",
    "( [ approxpsix ] ) .",
    "then , it can be shown that the approximated value of * b * is bounded as @xmath92 therefore , we can conclude that * b * has an upper finite limit .",
    "consequently , the lr and lsbr are avoided .",
    "* factor ordering ii : + in this case the expected value of @xmath24 can be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is large enough to ensure the validity of the approximated potential in ( [ diff2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , we have introduced a phenomenological weight @xmath96 such that the norm of the wave function is well defined and finite for large @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in fact , we could as well choose @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "after some simple algebra , we obtain @xmath99 consequently , we get @xmath100 once again , we reach the conclusion that * b * is finite . therefore , the lr and lsbr are avoided .",
    "singularities seem inevitable in most theories of gravity .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether by including quantum effects would the singularities be removed . in the case of the eibi scenario , while the big bang singularity can be removed , the intrinsic phantom dark energy doomsday remains inevitable @xcite .",
    "we solved the modified wheeler - dewitt equation of the eibi model for a homogeneous and isotropic universe whose matter content corresponds to two kinds of perfect fluid .",
    "those fluids within a classical universe would unavoidably induce lr or lsbr .",
    "we show that within the quantum approach we invoked , the dewitt criterion is fulfilled and it leads toward the potential avoidance of the lr and lsbr .",

    "<S> two of these doomsdays are the little rip ( lr ) and little sibling of the big rip ( lsbr ) . in this work , aside from proving the unavoidability of the lr and lsbr in the eddington - inspired - born - infeld ( eibi ) scenario , we carry out a quantum analysis of the eibi theory with a matter field , which , from a classical point of view would inevitably lead to a universe that ends with either lr or lsbr . based on a modified wheeler - dewitt equation , we demonstrate that such fatal endings seems to be avoidable </S>",
