    "systematic analyses of gpcr structures reveal the network of inter - tm contacts mediated by microswitches @xcite .",
    "network analysis also put forward that these microswitches act as the hub of the intra - receptor signaling network of a@xmath0ar @xcite , and analyses of md simulation trajectories confirmed that dynamics of microswitches occurs in concert @xcite . here , we extended our analysis to the dynamics of water molecules traversing through the tm channel and investigated their role in allosteric ( orthosteric ) signaling .",
    "as is well appreciated , water , an essential component of living systems , provides driving force for self - assemblies of biomolecules and enhances their conformational fluctuations @xcite . without water , biomolecules can not function @xcite .",
    "guided by the array of polar residues , water permeates inside the mostly dry and hydrophobic pore of gpcrs . in the antagonist - bound inactive state , this array of polar residues is connected continuously from the ec to ic domain . in accord with yuan",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , our simulations confirm the presence of the two hydrophobic layers , hl1 and hl2 ; however , these hydrophobic layers are not static , but highly dynamic .",
    "our study also confirms the yuan _",
    "s finding @xcite that the water flux along the tm channel is regulated by the rotameric states of several microswitches ( figure [ water_flux_map ] ) . among them , two key microswitches , w246@xmath72 and y288@xmath73 act together to form an  and - gate \" controlling the water flow .",
    "there are also other md simulation studies on gpcrs ( e.g. rhodopsin @xcite ) which propose that a continuous stream of internal water is important for gpcr activation . by counting the number of water molecules inside tm domain , leioatts _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that upon an elongation of retinal an influx of water increases inside the tm domain rhodopsin .",
    "they found that the increase of hydration level was significant in the complex - counterion simulation of rhodopsin , but not in the dark - state .",
    "their simulation results on water hydration in the dark - state of rhodopsin differ from a@xmath6ar in the inactive state in that only 20  30 water molecules are allowed inside the tm domain during the 1.6 @xmath1sec simulation time @xcite .",
    "however , the hydration level in the complex - counterion form is consistent with our study on the active form of a@xmath6ar in terms of the number of water molecules that fills the tm channel . in our study",
    ", both active and inactive states of a@xmath0ar could accommodate approximately an equivalent amount of water molecules , 60  100 , at steady state ( figure [ average_water_density]a ) , but the water flux in the inactive form was found greater than that in the inactive form by three times ( figure [ flux ] ) . here",
    ", it is crucial to distinguish  the flux of water across tm domain \" ( figure [ flux ] ) from  the number of water inside tm domain \" ( figure [ average_water_density ] ) . as described in _",
    "results _ , the water flux across tm domain was calculated by tracing the individual water molecule and counting the number of waters that enter and exit from one side of the membrane to the other .",
    "it is not merely the increase of tm water with time .",
    "while the number of water molecule inside the dark - state of rhodopsin is smaller than that in the inactive state of a@xmath6ar , the water flux in the dark - state of rhodopsin could also be large .",
    "our study puts more emphasis on the dynamic aspect of water molecules across tm domain in the _ steady state _ , which leads us to further ask the questions of which residues are hydrated by slow water and how those slow waters contribute to the water - contact mediated allosteric network .",
    "our explicit calculations of water fluxes indicate that the continuous water stream can be formed in all three states ( i.e. , @xmath104 in figure [ flux ] ) , but with differing degrees .",
    "thus , we want to argue that what is more relevant for gpcr activation is the water - mediated contacts among the key allosteric residues than the existence of continuous water stream .",
    "it is easier to make a water - mediated contact if a water molecule is slower . in the agonist - bound active state ,",
    "water molecules inside the tm channel are almost stagnant , displaying minimal flux ( figure [ flux ] ) ; they can stably hydrate the microswitches mainly along the tm7 helix .",
    "we show that water - mediated residue network extends from extracellular domain to the intracellular part of tm6 helix via tm3 helix ( figure [ corr_tau ] and figure [ allosteric_interface ] ) . the waters around tm microswitches , some of which constitute the water cluster , stabilize the relative orientation and distance between tm helices by bridging them together ( figure [ allosteric_interface ] and figure  s7 ) .",
    "our study highlights the interactions of internal water with microswitches , which contribute to extending and reinforcing the allosteric interface of gpcrs ( figure [ allosteric_interface ] ) .",
    "our study puts forward that these interactions are especially critical for the functional fidelity of the gpcr activity .",
