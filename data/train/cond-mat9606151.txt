    "when electromagnetic radiation is scattered from an inhomogeneous material , it undergoes phase changes which depend on which part of the material it scatters from .",
    "the resulting pattern of constructive and destructive interference at the detector depends sensitively on the geometry of domains in the scattering region .",
    "if the incident radiation is not coherent over the scattering region , this dependence is washed out by the phase differences in the incident beam . however , if the incident beam can be made coherent over the scattering volume , a speckled scattering pattern such as that shown in fig .  1 is observed .",
    "the intensity fluctuations associated with the speckle pattern are the basis of photon correlation experiments . over the last three decades ,",
    "lasers have become available as sources of coherent radiation at wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet to the infrared @xcite .    the much shorter wavelength of x - rays allows materials to be studied at smaller length scales than is possible with light , and the greater penetration allows the study of optically opaque materials .",
    "however , coherent x - rays have only become readily available with the emergence of high - intensity synchrotron photon sources .",
    "recently , speckle patterns have been observed in several experiments using coherent synchrotron x - rays .",
    "for example , diffusion rates in gold colloids were determined from the time brownian motion requires to change the x - ray speckle pattern @xcite , and speckle from coherent x - rays has also been used to study equilibrium fluctuations in fe@xmath4al near an order - disorder transition @xcite .",
    "an important situation for analyzing phase ordering processes is when the system is characterized by a single length scale @xmath5 , corresponding to the average domain size , that grows asymptotically with time @xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is known as the growth exponent . if the dynamics are controlled by diffusion , @xmath9 for a non - conserved order parameter and @xmath10 for a conserved order parameter .",
    "the significance of this for scattering experiments is that the scattering intensity at wavevector @xmath0 is proportional to the structure factor @xmath11 . at all times in the asymptotic scaling regime",
    "the average structure factor , @xmath12 , can be expressed in terms of a scaling function which depends on @xmath13 and @xmath6 only through a dimensionless wavevector @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spatial dimensionality .    an alternative way to consider",
    "this scaling behavior , which is more useful in describing the time dependence of the fluctuations in the scattering intensities at different wavevectors , is the following .",
    "one observes that the dynamics of structures on different length scales @xmath17 become statistically indistinguishable when viewed on the corresponding time scales @xmath18 .",
    "this can be expressed in a scaling relation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalq ] ) : @xmath19    in this paper we present a numerical study of a simple model for the scattering speckle observed in coherent x - ray scattering from systems undergoing phase ordering following a quench through a second - order order  disorder phase transition .",
    "this is the standard time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation with non - conserved order parameter , equivalent to model a in the classification scheme of hohenberg and halperin @xcite . using standard langevin dynamics ,",
    "we study the fluctuations in @xmath20-space and time of the structure factor . a representative scattering pattern for the simulations conducted here is presented in fig .  1 as a log - scale density plot .",
    "because the simulation samples the order parameter at @xmath21 locations in real space , the scattering function can only be sampled at @xmath21 independent locations in @xmath20-space .",
    "this corresponds in a natural way to the independent speckles seen in experiments .",
    "based on the scaling relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scalq ] ) and  ( [ eq : scalt ] ) one might naively expect that the position of an individual speckle should move as @xmath22 as the average structure factor changes according to the scaling form .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "instead , individual speckles are observed to brighten and dim with significant fluctuations around the time - dependent average intensity . the evolution of the simulated speckle intensities for a cut along the @xmath23 axis for a single simulation is presented in fig .",
    "they bear a striking similarity to recent experimental data for cu@xmath4au @xcite . from this figure",
    "it is clear that as the system evolves , individual speckles do _ not _ travel through @xmath20-space . in the simulations reported here",
    ", the correlations between neighboring speckles were found to be on the order of @xmath24 , so each speckle could be treated as independent .    in this paper",
    "the time - time correlation in the scattering intensity at fixed @xmath0 is obtained numerically via the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model for a non - conserved order parameter .",
    "the details of this approach are presented in the next section .",
    "section iii presents the results .",
    "the scattering intensity is shown to be an exponentially distributed random variable .",
    "the simulation results are also used to test the scaling ansatz for the two - time intensity correlation .",
    "the results here suggest that the intensity correlation time grows as @xmath25 section iv presents a review of this work along with some future directions we intend to pursue .",
    "we performed a standard simulation of the dynamics of phase ordering following a quench through an order - disorder phase transition in a system described by a nonconserved scalar order - parameter field @xmath26 .",
    "we used the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , @xmath27}{\\delta \\psi({\\bf x},t ) } + \\zeta({\\bf x},t ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : tdgl}\\ ] ] which we here have expressed in dimensionless variables for convenience .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdgl ] ) corresponds to deterministic relaxation towards a minimum value of the free energy @xmath28 $ ] , and the second term represents thermal noise . since the late - time dynamics are controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point , we ignore the noise term , using only the deterministic part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdgl ] ) .",
    "we employed the standard ginzburg - landau - wilson @xmath29 free energy @xcite with unit parameters .",
    "the deterministic dynamical equation then becomes @xmath30 note that by choosing the customary parameters in the free energy and the dynamical equation equal to unity , we have merely specified the length , concetration , and time scales in the simulation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) can therefore be used to represent the low - temperature dynamics of model a without loss of generality . since thermal fluctuations are explicitly excluded , the randomness they introduce into the domain pattern at early times@xcite is implemented by an initial condition where @xmath31 consists of independent gaussian random numbers with mean @xmath32 and standard deviation @xmath33 .",
    "the simulations were conducted on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions , lattice constant @xmath34 , and a system size of @xmath35 .",
    "the laplacian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) was approximated by the standard four - neighbor discretization , and a simple euler integration scheme with @xmath36 was used to collect data every @xmath37 time units up to a maximum of @xmath38 .",
    "results were averaged over 10 independent initial conditions .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath39 of @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 where the fact that the lattice spacing is unity in all directions has been used .",
    "the brillouin zone is defined by the discrete set of wavevectors , @xmath23 ,  @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",

    "\\label{eq : knorm}\\ ] ] this has been used for the two - time correlation function discussed in the next section where the value @xmath13 is used to bin data during circular averaging and to determine the value of scaling variables . because of lattice effects we consider only those wavevectors with @xmath48 , for which the finite interface thickness can be ignored in this work .",
    "the measured intensity at a given @xmath49 is a random variable with characteristics determined by the scattering system . as long as the independent domains are randomly located and oriented , and",
    "the domain size is much smaller than the system size , one may expect the central limit theorem to imply that the fourier transformed order parameter , @xmath50 , is well approximated by a complex gaussian random field , even if the real - space order - parameter field , @xmath51 , is not gaussian .",
    "one consequence of this is that the probability density function for the scattering intensity @xmath11 can be shown to be exponential for all @xmath20 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the probability density for the _ normalized _ intensities , @xmath52 , is therefore @xmath53 independent of @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "the probability density @xmath54 is normalized and has unit mean and standard deviation .",
    "since @xmath54 is identical for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 , only one density function needs to be constructed .",
    "this leads to very good statistics because on the order of @xmath55 samples are available .",
    "the results for all @xmath0 and @xmath6 , with @xmath56 found by averaging over wavevectors with equivalent values of @xmath57 , are presented in log - linear form in fig .",
    "the solid line is the expected density @xmath58 . for the simulation",
    "the probability density is exponential for all @xmath59 , although deviations may occur above this .",
    "we have verified that the distribution at given values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 also is exponential .",
    "one important consequence of an exponentially distributed intensity is that the average scattered intensity at @xmath49 is equal to the standard deviation of that intensity .",
    "this property can be used to simplify the normalized correlation function @xmath60 which has a value between @xmath61 and @xmath62 by construction . at @xmath63 the same - time limit",
    ", the exponential nature of @xmath64 makes the correlation unity as one would expect .",
    "as the two measurement times become widely separated , the values of the intensity become independent and the correlation decays to zero . for this relaxational system negative correlations",
    "are not expected .",
    "the scaling ansatz extended to this situation allows comparison of the scattering at different @xmath0 and @xmath6 by @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the rescaled times from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalt ] ) .",
    "the ansatz has been tested with the simulation data . because of the amount of data involved , it was necessary to bin the results .",
    "the results for @xmath67 were binned by @xmath6 and @xmath68 for each pair of times , the value of @xmath69 for a single @xmath0 was found and then placed into a bin in the @xmath70  plane .",
    "the average result for each bin was later found .",
    "the loss of precision from this procedure should not significantly affect the results .",
    "this function is most easily viewed as a contour plot in the @xmath70  plane , as in fig .",
    "4 . in this figure",
    "a @xmath71 contour , which is not shown , extends along the diagonal . moving away from that line ,",
    "contours at values of @xmath72 , @xmath33 , and @xmath73 are shown .",
    "scatter in the data becomes dominant for values less than this .",
    "the striking feature of this figure is that the correlation function becomes `` broader '' for later times , _",
    "i.e. _ the correlation time for the speckle intensity becomes longer as the phase ordering proceeds .",
    "an alternative set of variables for this problem are @xmath74 and @xmath75 a constant value of @xmath76 corresponds to a line perpendicular to the @xmath77 diagonal , while @xmath78 measures the distance ( in units of scaled time ) away from the diagonal . for a given value of @xmath76 , one can measure the characteristic time difference , @xmath79 required for the correlation to decay to a value of @xmath80 the values of @xmath81 estimated by linear interpolation from the simulation results are presented in log - log form in fig .",
    "5 . for large values of @xmath82",

    "furthermore , at these @xmath76 the correlation as a function of @xmath78 can be collapsed onto a single master curve using @xmath85 the results for a wide range of @xmath76 are presented in fig .  6 , where the interpolated value of @xmath81 has been used .",
    "the collapse of the data is quite good , indicating that at large @xmath76 the correlations can indeed be described by a single curve .",
    "intensity fluctuations in the scattering of coherent light from a two - dimensional system undergoing an order - disorder transition have been investigated by numerical simulation .",
    "the ratio of the measured intensity at given @xmath49 to its mean value at the same @xmath86 is found to be an exponentially distributed random number for the dynamically evolving system .",
    "the two - time intensity correlation function is found to obey scaling . at late times , its shape in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath87 line , in units of @xmath88 , is constant except for a characteristic time difference which increases as the system evolves .",
    "this characteristic decay time is found to scale as @xmath89    recently we have found that when the domain size is much smaller than the system size , the speckle correlation function defined in eq .",
