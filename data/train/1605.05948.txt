    "electroluminescence is an important and much studied property of semiconducting films of conjugated organic polymers which underlies their commercial application in organic light emitting diodes ( oleds).@xcite there is therefore significant interest in understanding the mechanism of this electroluminesence and the factors that affect it .",
    "the observation of magnetoelectroluminescence ( mel )  that is , a change in the electroluminescence upon application of a magnetic field  has provided direct evidence for the polaron pair mechanism described in section  ii.@xcite however , the physical interactions which govern the spin dynamics of the polaron pair are less well understood .",
    "recent isotopic substitution experiments have strongly suggested that hyperfine interactions between the electron spin and the spins of the hydrogen nuclei in the polaron pair play a crucial role,@xcite but it remains unclear whether other physical effects are also important .",
    "previous analyses of mel have all been undertaken with an implicit assumption that the number density of polaron pairs in the material is independent of the applied magnetic field.@xcite this leads to a very simple relationship between the experimentally accessible magnetoelectroluminescence and the theoretically accessible singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction ( see section  iii ) .",
    "however , it is not an assumption which is easily justified .",
    "the fact that magnetoconductance ( mc ) is also well known in oleds implies that the steady state number density of free polarons , and therefore also of polaron pairs , must be a function of the applied magnetic field , and it seems likely that this is the reason why previous analyses have been unable to account for the form of the experimental mel at high magnetic field strengths@xcite    in section  iv , we present a new and more general relationship between the mel and the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction which avoids the assumption of constant polaron pair number density .",
    "this relationship involves the measured mc , but it does not make any assumptions about its underlying mechanism , which may have a variety of different contributions in addition to the polaron pair mechanism itself.@xcite    section  v goes on to discuss the calculation of the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction using the early semiclassical theory of schulten and wolynes,@xcite which is expected to be reasonably reliable for polarons with @xmath0 nuclear spins . the only input that this theory requires beyond the overall singlet and triplet decay rates of the polaron pair is the standard deviation @xmath1 of the hyperfine field in each polaron .",
    "section  vi argues that this is the only experimentally accessible piece of information about the hyperfine interactions in conjugated organic polarons , because their electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra do not exhibit resolved hyperfine splittings.@xcite all that is actually seen in these spectra is a broad first - derivative line which integrates to give a gaussian profile with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) proportional to @xmath1 .    section  vii returns to the question of whether hyperfine and zeeman interactions are enough to account for the spin dynamics in polaron pairs , using the experimental mel and mc data of nguyen _",
    "et al._@xcite for both normal ( h- ) and deuterated ( d- ) poly(2,5-dioctyloxy - paraphenylene vinylene ) ( doo - ppv ) for illustration .",
    "we argue on the basis of the weller equation,@xcite and the anticipated effect of deuteration on the polaron hyperfine fields , that these data can not be explained in terms of hyperfine and zeeman interactions alone : there must also be some other physical effect influencing the spin dynamics .",
    "several possible physical effects have already been considered and discounted for polaron pairs in conjugated organic polymers like doo - ppv.@xcite for example , the spin - orbit interaction is unlikely to play a significant role in mediating the intersystem crossing in a polymer without any heavy atoms , and whatever small difference there may be between the g - values of the two electrons in the polaron pair is unlikely to be significant at the magnetic field strengths of nguyen _ et al .",
    "_ s experiments",
    ". however , comparatively little attention has yet been given in this context to the role of electron spin relaxation .",
    "we suggest in section  vii that the experimental data for both isotopologues of doo - ppv might be explained by including the effect of singlet - triplet dephasing,@xcite which could arise ( for example ) from the modulation of the exchange interaction between the electrons in the polaron pair as the polarons migrate along and between their polymer chains.@xcite    this suggestion is backed up by explicit simulations of h - doo - ppv and d - doo - ppv in section  viii , which show that the experimental data of nguyen _",
    "et al._@xcite can be reproduced almost quantitatively for both isotopologues over a wide range of magnetic field strengths when singlet - triplet dephasing is taken into account .",
    "section  ix concludes the paper with a discussion of the kinetic parameters that are obtained from our analysis of doo - ppv and some comments about the implications of our results for the mechanism of its magnetoconductance .",
    "it is widely believed that electroluminescence in organic polymer devices occurs through the polaron pair mechanism illustrated in fig .",
    "1.@xcite the injection of electrons and holes into the polymer film leads to the formation of positive and negative polarons ( p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 ) .",
    "these diffuse through the material under the influence of the applied potential until they encounter a polaron of opposite charge on an adjacent polymer chain , with which they form a loosely bound polaron pair ( pp ) . since the spins of the polarons are initially uncorrelated , singlet and triplet polaron pairs are formed in a statistical ratio of 1:3 .",
    "a singlet ( or triplet ) polaron pair may then form an intra - chain exciton with a rate constant @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , with the electron hopping onto the polymer chain on which the hole resides or vice versa . alternatively",
    ", the polaron pair could dissociate to reform free polarons with a rate constant @xmath6 , which we have assumed to be the same for both the singlet and triplet states . if the total decay rate constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 are small enough , significant interconversion between the singlet and triplet states of the polaron pair is possible , due to the hyperfine and zeeman interactions within each polaron .",
    "if @xmath9 , then changes in the frequency of interconversion will affect the singlet exciton yield .",
    "since only the singlet exciton is emissive , and the strength of an applied magnetic field @xmath10 alters the rate of interconversion between the singlet and triplet states , the polaron pair mechanism gives rise to magnetoelectroluminescence , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electroluminescence in the presence of the field and @xmath13 is the electroluminescence in its absence .",
    "a magnetic field effect on the conductance has also been observed in organic polymer devices .",
    "however , the origin of this effect is far less well understood , and it is a subject of continuing debate.@xcite we shall sidestep this issue here by making no assumptions about the mechanism of the magnetoconductance , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the conductance in the presence of the field and @xmath16 is the conductance in its absence .",
    "both the mel and mc have been measured in a variety of materials . in what follows , we will concentrate on doo - ppv , whose repeat unit is shown in fig .",
    "this material was chosen because the impact of deuteration on its magnetic field effects has been studied experimentally,@xcite providing direct evidence for the hyperfine - mediated intersystem crossing between the singlet and triplet states of its polaron pairs .",
    "the experimentally determined mel and mc in undeuterated doo - ppv ( h - doo - ppv ) are shown in fig .  3 , and those in deuterated doo - ppv ( d - doo - ppv ) in fig .  4 .",
    "in order to compare these experimental observations with theoretical calculations , we shall need to derive a new relationship between the observed mel and mc and the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction .",
    "this is because , as we have already mentioned in the introduction and shall discuss in more detail next , we believe there is something wrong with the expression that has been used to calculate mel(@xmath10 ) in the past.@xcite",
    "clearly , the electroluminescence at a given magnetic field strength will depend not only on the singlet exciton yield of the polaron pair decay , but also on the steady state concentration of polaron pairs in the polymer film . in all previous",
    "work,@xcite an implicit assumption has been made that the steady state concentration of polaron pairs is independent of the applied magnetic field . in that case , one arrives at a straightforward expression for the mel within the polaron pair model,@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the singlet exciton yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction when the applied magnetic field has magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , since @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total singlet yield of the reaction ( the fraction of polaron pairs which , having formed in a statistical 1:3 mixture of singlet and triplet states , either recombine to give singlet excitons or dissociate to give free polaron pairs in the singlet state ) , one has @xmath21 that is , under the assumption that the steady state concentration of polaron pairs is independent of the applied magnetic field , the magnetoelectroluminescence is identical to the magnetic field effect on the overall singlet yield of the polaron pair reaction , msy@xmath22 .    however , whenever eq .",
    "( 5 ) has been used in conjunction with quantum mechanical or semiclassical calculations of @xmath20 in the past,@xcite the results have failed to capture the correct qualitative behaviour of the observed mel@xmath22 , which unlike msy@xmath22 does not plateau at high field strengths ( see the experimental results in figs .  3 and  4 above and the theoretical results in figs .  6 and  7 below ) .",
    "so let us now develop an alternative expression that allows for the magnetic field dependence of the steady state concentration ( or number density ) of polaron pairs , @xmath23 .",
    "it not legitimate to apply a simple ( incoherent ) steady state analysis to the polaron pair mechanism illustrated in fig .  1 , because the hyperfine and zeeman mediated intersystem crossing between the singlet and triplet states of the polaron pair is a coherent process .",
    "one is therefore obliged to base the analysis on the quantum mechanical density operator of the polaron pair .",
    "let the normalised density operator of this polaron pair be @xmath24 , and define the number density operator @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 = n_{\\rm pp}(b){\\rm tr}[\\hat{\\rho}(b ) ] = n_{\\rm pp}(b).\\ ] ] then in view of fig .  1 , the equation that governs the evolution of @xmath27 is @xmath28 with @xmath29 . here",

    "when the device has reached a steady state ( constant current and constant electroluminescence in the presence of the applied magnetic field ) , @xmath48 .",
    "so from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the steady - state number density operator of the polaron pairs is @xmath49 from this , one can calculate the steady - state number density of singlet polaron pairs , @xmath50 , using the standard formula @xmath51,\\ ] ] which gives @xmath52 with @xmath53.\\ ] ]    the reason why we have written eq .",
    "( 14 ) in this way is that @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) is precisely the singlet yield of the recombination reaction that would be obtained if the polaron pair were prepared with the initial density operator @xmath54 at time @xmath55 ( corresponding to a statistical 1:3 initial population of the singlet and triplet states ) , as can be seen from the standard expression for this singlet yield@xcite @xmath56\\,dt.\\ ] ] this therefore establishes a connection between the present steady - state argument and the formula for mel(@xmath10 ) in eq .",
    "however , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 14 ) also contains a magnetic field dependence in the factor @xmath57 , which suggests that eq .",
    "( 5 ) is incorrect .",
    "indeed it is clear from fig .  1 that the steady state fluoresence intensity el@xmath22 will be proportional to @xmath58 and therefore , from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , that eq .",
    "( 5 ) should be replaced by @xmath59    in order to make any further progress , we shall now need to make a simplifying assumption about the relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the steady - state number densities of positively and negatively charged polarons in the polymer film .",

( 5 ) .    this is our central result  a new relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath73 that involves the magnetic field effect on the overall singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction , @xmath71 .",
    "the only two assumptions we have made in deriving this result are that the contacts are approximately ohmic and the mobilities @xmath66 and @xmath67 of p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 are independent of the applied magnetic field . given these assumptions , the result is a direct consequence of the polaron pair mechanism for magnetoelectroluminescence illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "notice in particular that we have not made any assumptions about the mechanism of the magnetoconductance , other than that the applied magnetic field does not change the mobilities of the positively and negatively charged free polarons .",
    "this is consistent with many of the mechanisms that have been proposed for magnetoconductance in polymer films , including the polaron pair mechanism,@xcite the bipolaron mechanism in the regime of positive mc,@xcite and a more recently proposed mechanism involving the trapping of polarons at defect sites.@xcite in all three of these scenarios , the magnetic field effect on the conductance is believed to arise from a change in the free polaron number density in the presence of the magnetic field rather than a change in the free polaron mobility .",
    "indeed it is explicitly stated in ref .   that no magnetic field effect is found experimentally on the mobilities of the free polarons in ppv derivatives .",
    "the curves labelled msy(@xmath10 ) in figs .  3 and  4 were obtained from the experimental mel(@xmath10 ) and mc(@xmath10 ) curves by rearranging eq .",

    "( 23 ) is thus that it provides a link between the experimentally measurable magnetoelectroluminescence and magnetoconductance and the theoretically calculable magnetic field effect on the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction .",
    "we shall now take this view and move on to discuss the calculation of @xmath20 , and hence msy(@xmath10 ) , for materials like doo - ppv .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 8) that governs the coherent electron spin evolution between the singlet and triplet states of the polaron pair is given to within a good approximation by@xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( p@xmath2 ) and 2 ( p@xmath3 ) . here",
    "@xmath78 is the electron spin angular momentum operator of the unpaired electron in polaron @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the hyperfine coupling constant between this electron spin and the @xmath81-th nuclear spin in the polaron , and @xmath82 is the corresponding nuclear spin angular momentum operator . in the electronic zeeman term @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron spin , and the magnetic field has been chosen to be in the laboratory @xmath85 direction .",
    "note that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 25 ) neglects the dipolar and exchange coupling between the two electrons in the polaron pair .",
    "these will be comparatively weak in a material such as doo - ppv , in which the long doo side chains will tend to keep the polarons on neighbouring polymers quite far apart .",
    "it also neglects the zeeman interactions of the nuclear spins with the applied magnetic field , which will be weaker still because of the small gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclear spins .    in principle",
    ", we could now simply insert the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 25 ) into eq .",
    "( 8) , and do the spin dynamics calculation quantum mechanically .",
    "however , this would require a detailed knowledge of the hyperfine coupling constants @xmath80 in the two polarons .",
    "these hyperfine coupling constants , or rather their distribution , could in principle be calculated from a consideration of the vibronic - coupling and disorder - induced localisation of electrons in positively and negatively charged doo - ppv polymers,@xcite but such a calculation is well beyond the scope of the present study . and",
    "in any case , an exact quantum mechanical spin dynamical calculation of @xmath20 would be quite impractical for a polaron with @xmath86 nuclear spins .    to avoid both of these problems",
    ", we shall resort here to a simple semiclassical approximation to the spin dynamics proposed by schulten and wolynes,@xcite which is expected to be reasonably reliable for a polaron with @xmath86 nuclear spins .",
    "this approximation neglects the ( comparatively slow ) nuclear spin evolution in such a polaron by replacing the hyperfine - weighted sum of its nuclear spin operators @xmath87 with a gaussian distribution of static hyperfine fields @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 for each pair of polaron hyperfine fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the hamiltonian in eqs .",

    "this both makes the calculation of @xmath20 straightforward and reduces the hyperfine coupling constants @xmath80 in each polaron to a single physically relevant parameter @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , this single physical parameter is all that can be deduced about the distribution of the hyperfine coupling constants from experimental measurements , because the electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra of condensed phase ppv derivatives do not exhibit any resolved hyperfine splittings.@xcite all that is seen in these spectra is a broad first - derivative esr line which integrates to give an approximately gaussian profile with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath101 as one would expect from the gaussian distribution of @xmath102 in eq .",
    "the measured esr spectra are thus entirely consistent with the schulten - wolynes approximation that we have used to obtain eq .",
    "( 33 ) .",
    "in particular , kuroda _",
    "et al._@xcite have measured the light - induced electron spin resonance spectra of thin films of two different dialkoxy derivatives of ppv ( meh - ppv and cn - ppv ) .",
    "they found a fwhm of @xmath103 mt for one and @xmath104 mt for the other , with no evidence for any difference between the contributions of positive and negative polarons to either esr signal .",
    "more recently , zezin _",
    "et al._@xcite have measured an esr linewidth of @xmath105 mt for the positive polarons in long oligomers of doo - ppv in an irradiated glassy toluene solution at 77 k in the presence of an electron scavenger , and performed similar experiments in the presence and absence of the scavenger to deduce that the positive and negative polarons of meh - ppv have somewhat different esr linewidths ( 0.37 mt and 0.59 mt , respectively ) .",
    "since all of these linewidths are fairly similar , and since the results we shall present below are fairly insensitive to the precise choice of @xmath100 , we shall avoid introducing too many free parameters into our calculations by assuming a fwhm esr linewidth of 0.5 mt for both the positive and the negative polarons in thin films of h - doo - ppv .",
    "the use of 0.5 mt for the positive polarons is consistent with the long doo - ppv oligomer experiments of zezin",
    "_ et al._@xcite the assumption that this is the same for both positive and negative polarons is consistent with the thin film experiments of kuroda _",

    "( 34 ) , a fwhm of 0.5 mt gives @xmath106 mt for h - doo - ppv , and the corresponding parameter for d - doo - ppv can be worked out as follows . aside from @xmath107c nuclei , which will be present throughout the polymer with @xmath108% natural abundance , the only magnetic nuclei in h - doo - ppv are protons . since h has @xmath109 and d has @xmath110 , and the hyperfine coupling constants @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( 29 ) are proportional to the gyromagnetic ratios @xmath111 and @xmath112 of the two nuclei , the effect of deuteration will be to reduce @xmath1 to@xcite @xmath113 which gives @xmath114 mt .    to summarise , the magnetic field effect on the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction , msy@xmath22 , can be calculated semiclassically from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and  ( 33 ) .",
    "the second of these equations involves the hyperfine field strengths @xmath100 of the positive and negative polarons p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 ( @xmath77 and 2 ) in the pair .",
    "these hyperfine fields have yet to be measured directly in an esr experiment on thin films of doo - ppv itself , so we have suggested plausible values on the basis of related experiments that have been performed on thin films of similar dialkoxy ppvs and on solutions of oligomers of doo - ppv .",
    "let us now explain why hyperfine interactions alone are not enough to account for the experimental data in figs .  3 and  4 .",
    "the msy(@xmath10)s for h - doo - ppv and d - doo - ppv in these figures are compared on an expanded scale in fig .",
    "both curves tend to the same asymptote msy(@xmath115 ) at high field strengths , but they differ in the intermediate field region where the magnetic field effect is still growing .",
    "it is convenient to characterise each curve in this region with a single number @xmath116 , the magnetic field strength at which msy(@xmath10 ) has reached half its asymptotic value . if the observed @xmath116 values were solely due to the hyperfine fields in the two polarons , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , one would expect them to conform to the weller equation@xcite @xmath119 which reduces to @xmath120 when the hyperfine fields of the positive and negative polarons are the same .",
    "however , the @xmath116 values in fig .  5 clearly do not satisfy this equation . from the experimental data , @xmath121 mt and @xmath122 mt ,",
    "both of which are more than an order of magnitude larger than our esr - based estimates of the hyperfine field strengths @xmath123 mt and @xmath124 mt . moreover the ratio @xmath125 is inconsistent with the ratio @xmath126 one would predict from eq .",
    "( 35 ) .",
    "this suggests that another process plays an important role in the spin dynamics of the polaron pairs .",
    "many other processes have already been considered and discounted,@xcite but comparatively little attention has yet been given to electron spin relaxation .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , because the most common mechanism of relaxation , the modulation of hyperfine interactions , leads to irrelevantly long spin - lattice relaxation times for the polarons in solid state organic polymers.@xcite however , other relaxation mechanisms could well be significant , such as the modulation of the exchange interaction between the two electrons in a polaron pair .",
    "the strength of this interaction depends exponentially on the separation between the two electrons , which varies due to the migration of the polarons within the pair.@xcite it has been shown in other contexts that this modulation can cause the decay of coherences between the singlet and triplet states (  singlet - triplet dephasing\"),@xcite and moreover that this can lead to @xmath116 values significantly larger than those predicted by the weller equation.@xcite    in order to include this phenomenon in our semiclassical simulations , we can simply add an appropriate term to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 32),@xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a singlet - triplet dephasing rate constant and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the singlet and triplet projection operators in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and  ( 11 ) .",
    "this extra ( manifestly hermitian ) term clearly results in the decay of coherences between the singlet and triplet states while leaving their populations unchanged ( as required ) .",
    "it should be noted that the average exchange interaction has been neglected in the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 30 ) , even though its modulation is included here .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the average strength of the exchange coupling constant is extremely difficult to determine in these organic polymers,@xcite and we are reluctant to introduce any more arbitrary parameters into our calculations than are absolutely necessary . secondly , the exponential dependence of the exchange interaction on distance implies that even if the average exchange interaction were negligible , rare excursions to short distances might well be enough to give a significant modulation effect . and",
    "thirdly , we have found in exploratory calculations that the spin dynamics are largely unaffected by the inclusion of a physically reasonable average exchange coupling .",
    "we shall therefore neglect this average coupling for simplicity .",
    "with singlet - triplet dephasing included , we are finally in a position to simulate the experimental results in figs .  3 and  4 and see how well the simulations match the experiments . since we have already specified what we believe to be realistic hyperfine fields @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the undeuterated and deuterated doo - ppv polarons , the simulation only involves three free parameters : the overall singlet and triplet polaron pair decay rate constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the singlet - triplet dephasing rate constant @xmath128",
    "we have therefore performed a combined least squares fit to the experimental data for both polymers in the @xmath131 parameter space using the downhill simplex method , which was found to yield a single minimum at @xmath132 s@xmath133 , @xmath134 s@xmath133 , and @xmath135 s@xmath133 .",

    "( 24 ) and shows that singlet - triplet dephasing plays an important role in the polaron pair spin dynamics . when the same three parameters @xmath128 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are optimised to fit the computed msy(@xmath10 ) to the experimental mel(@xmath10 ) as has been done in the past@xcite ( see eq .",

    "one feature of the experimental results that is not reproduced by our calculations is the low field effect ( lfe),@xcite also referred to as the ultra - small magnetic field effect ( usmfe),@xcite which results in a negative dip in msy(@xmath10 ) below @xmath138 mt for h - doo - ppv and @xmath105 mt for h - doo - ppv .",

    "it should be noted that the schulten - wolynes approximation is expected to be least reliable in the low field region .",
    "in fact , it has been shown to give a quantitatively incorrect lfe in model calculations on a moderately sized radical pair for which the exact quantum mechanical calculation could be performed for comparison.@xcite we do not therefore feel that the lack of a ( small ) lfe in the present calculations is worth pursuing further here . this effect could be captured more accurately by replacing the schulten - wolynes approximation with an improved semiclassical theory in which the nuclear spin precession is taken into account.@xcite however that would require a detailed knowledge of the hyperfine coupling constants in the two polarons which we do not have , and which the schulten - wolynes approximation conveniently avoids .",
    "while the mechanism of the magnetoconductance in organic polymer films is still somewhat controversial,@xcite the magnetoelectroluminescence is widely accepted to arise from the polaron pair recombination scheme illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "in this paper , we have used this scheme to derive the expression in eq .",
    "( 24 ) relating the theoretically calculable magnetic field effect on the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction , msy@xmath22 , to the experimentally measurable magnetoelectroluminescence mel(@xmath10 ) and magnetoconductance mc@xmath22 of the polymer film .",
    "we have argued that this expression holds independently of the mechanism of the magnetoconductance , provided the mobilities of the positive and negative polarons are not affected by the magnetic field ( i.e. , provided there is no contribution from spin - dependent transport ) .",
    "we have also discussed the semiclassical calculation of msy@xmath22 for polymers such as doo - ppv , the standard deviations of the hyperfine fields in which can be extracted from esr linewidth measurements.@xcite once these hyperfine fields are known , the semiclassical ( schulten - wolynes@xcite ) calculation of msy(@xmath10 ) involves just three empirical parameters : the overall singlet and triplet decay rate constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the polaron pair and a singlet - triplet dephasing rate constant @xmath128 .",
    "the last of these parameters has not been included in any previous theory of magnetoelectroluminescence that we are aware of , but we have argued on the basis of the weller equation@xcite that its inclusion is essential to reproduce the experimental results of nguyen _",
    "et al._@xcite for h - doo - ppv and d - doo - ppv .",
    "the fits of the resulting theory to the experimental data are shown in fig .  6 for h - doo - ppv and fig .  7 for d - doo - ppv .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is clearly very good for both isotopologues over a wide range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "the empirical parameters obtained from the fit are @xmath132 s@xmath133 , @xmath134 s@xmath133 and @xmath135 s@xmath133 , and all that remains is to explain why we feel that these parameters are reasonable .    dividing @xmath128 by the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron , @xmath139 s@xmath133t@xmath133 , we find that the singlet - triplet dephasing can be associated with a magnetic field of 0.85 mt , which is somewhat larger than the hyperfine field in either isotopologue ( @xmath123 mt and @xmath124 mt ) .",
    "this is entirely consistent with our discussion of the weller equation in sec .",
    "vii , and it suggests that singlet - triplet dephasing does indeed play a significant role in determining the experimentally - observed @xmath116 values for the two isotopologues .",
    "our singlet and triplet polaron pair decay rate constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 are similar , and they have a reasonable magnitude , corresponding to a polaron pair lifetime of a couple of microseconds . the only aspect of these rates that needs further comment is the fact that @xmath42 is smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "this is at odds with at least one theoretical treatment of singlet and triplet exciton formation rates from polaron pairs.@xcite however , it is an inevitable consequence of the experimental data in figs .  6 and  7 : a positive magnetic field effect in the high - field limit , msy@xmath140 ,",
    "can only be obtained when @xmath141.@xcite this is shown graphically in fig",
    ".  8 , which plots the computed msy(@xmath115 ) as a function of @xmath142 for h - doo - ppv when @xmath128 and @xmath42 have the same values as in figs .",
    "6 and  7 .",
    "the behaviour in fig .",
    "8 can be explained as follows . when @xmath143 , eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and  ( 33 ) both give @xmath144 for all @xmath10 , and therefore msy(@xmath115 ) = 0 .",
    "but when @xmath141 , the triplet states of the polaron pair decay more rapidly than the singlet state , and @xmath20 is less than 1/4 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath20 is most pronounced at low field strengths , where singlet population can be lost through intersystem crossing to all three components ( t@xmath145 , t@xmath146 , t@xmath147 ) of the triplet . at high field strengths",
    "the zeeman splittings of the t@xmath148 triplet components make them energetically inaccessible to singlet - triplet interconversion , so singlet population can only be lost through interconversion to t@xmath145",
    ". therefore @xmath149 and msy@xmath140 .",
    "conversely , when @xmath150 , a similar argument gives @xmath151 and msy@xmath152 .",
    "finally , while we have deliberately avoided making any assumptions about the mechanism of the magnetoconductance in doo - ppv , our results do in fact shed some light on this .",
    "one of the most widely discussed mechanisms of magnetoconductance is the polaron pair mechanism , in which the effect of the magnetic field on the conductance is assumed to arise from its effect on the dissociation yield of the polaron pair back to free charge carriers ( p@xmath2 and p@xmath3).@xcite however , it is clear from figs .  3 and  4 that the magnetic field effect on the overall singlet yield of the polaron pair , which includes both the singlet exciton yield and the yield of free charge carriers in the singlet state , has already saturated at a field strength of 20 mt , whereas the magnetoelectroluminescence and magnetoconductance continue to increase at higher field strengths ( up to 40 mt ) .",
    "since when the overall singlet yield has saturated the overall triplet yield ( including the yield of free charge carriers in the triplet state ) must have saturated too , this clearly implies that the change in the magnetoconductance beyond 20 mt can not come from the polaron pair mechanism .",
    "so although it seems likely , given the similarities between the mc(@xmath10 ) and msy(@xmath10 ) curves in figs .",
    "3 and  4 , that the polaron pair mechanism of magnetoconductance does play an important role in doo - ppv , there must also be some other mechanism in operation at high magnetic field strengths .",
