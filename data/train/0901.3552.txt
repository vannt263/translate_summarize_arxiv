    "pks  1421490 was first reported as a bright , flat spectrum radio source by @xcite .",
    "subsequent vlbi imaging revealed 10mas scale structure within the brightest component of this source @xcite .",
    "studies at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) later revealed significant radio emission on arcsecond scales extending south - west from the brightest component @xcite .",
    "for this reason , pks  1421490 was included in a _",
    "survey of flat spectrum radio quasars with arcsecond scale radio jets @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( from here on g05 ) reported on recent x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) , optical ( magellan ) and radio ( atca ) imaging of this source .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for the details of these observations and images .",
    "figure [ fig : atca ] illustrates the arcsecond scale radio structure of pks  1421490 ; it is annotated to show the naming convention for different components in the radio image used by g05 , as well as the correct interpretation of each of these components brought out in this study .",
    "g05 obtained an optical spectrum of region b , and suggested it was not associated with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in view of the apparent lack of spectral lines ( due to poor signal to noise ratio in that spectrum ) .",
    "region a was known to contain bright vlbi scale radio structure @xcite and had a flat radio spectrum ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "region b was also known to be much weaker than region a at radio wavelengths .",
    "consequently region a was thought to be an agn , while region b was ( erroneously ) interpreted by g05 as a jet knot . in this paper",
    "we show that in fact region b _ is _ the active galactic nucleus ( see  [ sec : region_b ] ) , and that region a contains a high surface brightness hotspot .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the interpretation and modeling of the exceptional hotspot in region a which has until now been interpreted as an agn .",
    "one of the major results of this paper relates to an observed low frequency flattening in the hotspot radio spectrum at ghz frequencies , which indicates that the underlying electron energy distribution flattens towards lower energies .",
    "the low energy electron distribution is not only important for calculating parameters such as the number density and energy density , it also provides important constraints on the particle acceleration mechanism . in turn",
    ", this will help to address more fundamental issues such as jet composition and speed .",
    "we now present a brief overview of the literature relating to the low energy electron distribution in jets and hotspots .    in a small number of objects , flattening of the hotspot radio spectra towards lower frequencies has been observed . in most cases ,",
    "synchrotron self absorption and free - free absorption can be ruled out , and the observed flattening is interpreted in terms of a turn - over in the electron energy distribution @xcite . when modeling hotspot spectra , the turn - over in the electron energy distribution is usually approximated by setting the electron number density equal to zero below a cut - off lorentz factor @xmath7 . in each case where flattening of the hotspot radio spectrum has been directly observed , estimates of @xmath7 are of the order of several hundred : cygnus a , @xmath8 300 - 400 @xcite ; 3c295 , @xmath8 800 @xcite ; 3c123 , @xmath8 1000 @xcite ; pks  1421490 , @xmath8 650 ( this work ) .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for a low energy cut - off in two other hotspots ; 3c268.1 and 3c68.1 . in both",
    "these ojects , the hotspot radio spectra are significantly flatter between 150mhz and 1.5ghz than they are above 1.5ghz , which suggests a similar value of @xmath7 to those listed above , provided the hotspot magnetic field strengths are similar .",
    "more recently @xcite reported on a possible detection of an optical inverse compton hotspot in the quasar 3c196 . by modeling the synchrotron self compton emission and assuming a magnetic field strength close to the equipartition value , they inferred a cut - off lorentz factor @xmath9 .",
    "all of the above listed @xmath7 estimates appear to be distributed around a value of @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have inferred the existence of a low energy cut - off at @xmath11 in the hotspots of the giant radio galaxy 6c  09053955 .",
    "their method of detecting the low energy cut - off is quite different to those described above , and is based on the interpretation of an absence of x - ray emission from the eastern hotspot and radio lobe in that source .    in  [ sec : gamma_min ] we show that a turn - over in the electron energy distribution at @xmath12 can arise naturally from dissipation of jet energy if the jet has a high proton fraction and a bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "however , @xcite have suggested that the low frequency flattening in the radio spectrum of a cygnus a hotspot is not related to the turn - over in electron energy distribution .",
    "rather , they argue , it indicates a transition between two different acceleration mechanisms .    electron energy distributions with a low energy cut - off",
    "have also been discussed in relation to pc - scale jets .",
    "the absence of significant faraday depolarization in compact sources suggests that the number density of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath14 greatly exceeds that of lower energy particles @xcite . @xcite",
    "have argued that some statistical trends in superluminal pc - scale jets may be understood in terms of effects arising from a low energy cut - off in the electron energy distribution . @xcite",
    "have suggested that a low energy cut - off in the electron spectrum can alleviate several theoretical difficulties associated with the inverse compton catastrophe in compact radio sources , including anomalously high brightness temperatures and the apparent lack of clustering of powerful sources at 10@xmath15 k. however , circular polarization in the pc - scale jet of 3c279 requires a minimum lorentz factor @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on the low energy electron distribution in extragalactic jets on kpc - scales are rare .",
    "a low energy cut - off in the electron energy distribution at @xmath17 has been estimated for the jet of pks  0637752 ( 500 kpc from the nucleus ) through modeling of the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution in terms of inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : observations ] we discuss our observations and data reduction . in  [ sec : region_b ] we discuss the active galactic nucleus - in particular the optical spectrum and broad band spectral energy distribution . in ",
    "[ sec : hotspot ] we present the vlbi image of the northern hotspot and derive plasma parameters by modeling the broad band spectral energy distribution . in  [ sec : whole_source_fit ] we independently estimate the hotspot plasma parameters by modeling the radio spectrum of the entire radio galaxy . in  [ sec : break_frequency ] we discuss the incompatibility of the observed spectrum with the standard continuous injection plus synchrotron cooling model for hotspots . in  [ sec : doppler ] we consider doppler beaming as a possible cause of the high radio surface brightness and various other properties of the hotspot . in ",

    "( 1989 ) obtained a flux density of 4.1  jy at 2.3  ghz for the northern hotspot by model fitting sheve ( southern hemisphere vlbi experiment ) data with the simplest model consistent with the data ( two circular gaussians ) .",
    "we attempted to detect compact structure within region b ( the core ) using the data - set that had been correlated with the phase centre at that position .",

    "the upper limit to the flux density of region b at 4.8@xmath21ghz is 7@xmath21mjy @xcite      pks  1421490 was observed with 5 elements of the lba ( atca , mopra , parkes , hobart and ceduna ) in may 2005 at 8.4@xmath21ghz .",
    "a full 12 hour synthesis was obtained , recording a single 16@xmath21mhz bandwidth in both left and right hand circular polarization . at this frequency , the northern hotspot of pks  1421490 is completely resolved on all but the shortest three baselines ( baselines between parkes , the atca and mopra ) .",
    "we fringe fitted our target source data using a point source model in aips , before performing model - fitting and phase self calibration iterations in difmap .      due to the small number of baselines",
    ", we use model - fitting in the ( _ u , v_)-plane rather than clean deconvolution to measure the hotspot flux density at 8.4@xmath21ghz .",
    "model - fitting involves specifying a starting model in the image plane , consisting of a number of elliptical gaussian components , each with a particular flux density , position , size and position angle , then allowing the model fitting algorithm to locate a chi - squared minimum by fitting the fourier transform of the model to the ( _ u , v_)-data .",
    "care is necessary when comparing the lba flux density measurements at the two different frequencies , due to the limited ( _ u , v _ ) coverage . at 2.3@xmath21ghz ,",
    "the data cover ( _ u , v _ ) spacings between 0.5 and 13 m@xmath59 , while at 8.4@xmath21ghz the data cover ( _ u , v _ ) spacings between 2 and 9 m@xmath59 .",
    "therefore , provided the source structure can be described by a simple model consisting of a set of gaussian components , the comparison of model flux densities will be valid .    in order to determine the range of allowable flux densities in the 8.4  ghz data - set , we specified a wide range of different models consisting of 3 , 4 or 5 elliptical gaussian components , broadly consistent with the 2.3  ghz image , then let the model - fitting algorithm adjust the model to fit the 8.4  ghz data . while it is not possible to precisely constrain the flux density of the hotspot with only three baselines , we found that the total flux density of all acceptable models ( using between three and five elliptical gaussian components and a wide range of initial model parameters ) was never less than 2.9@xmath21jy , and the flux density of the best - fitting model was 3.2@xmath21jy .",
    "the 8.6@xmath21ghz atca image contains an unresolved source of 3.3  jy at the position of the hotspot , and this provides an upper limit to the hotspot flux density at 8.6@xmath21ghz .",
    "we therefore adopt a hotspot flux density at 8.4  ghz of @xmath60jy .",
    "atca observations of pks  1421490 were made simultaneously during our lba observations .",
    "we recorded a single 64@xmath21mhz bandwidth at 8.4@xmath21ghz and 128@xmath21mhz bandwidth at 4.8@xmath21ghz during our first lba observation in 2005 .",
    "a single 128@xmath21mhz bandwidth at 2.3@xmath21ghz was recorded during our second lba observation in 2006 . for each of these observations ,",
    "the atca was in a compact configuration so we could not image the source in detail , but we were able to obtain accurate total source flux density measurements ( see table [ table : obs_info ] ) .",
    "total source flux density measurements were also obtained at 1.4@xmath21ghz using archival atca data .",
    "standard calibration and imaging procedures were used with the miriad processing software .    in august 2005",
    "we obtained a full 12 hour synthesis with the new 3 mm receivers .",
    "again , standard calibration and imaging procedures were used in miriad .",
    "the flux density scale was determined from scans on the planet uranus and confirmed using the point - like source pks  1921293 , the flux density of which had been measured 4 days prior to our observing run as @xmath61jy at 93.5@xmath21ghz .",
    "we detected a single point like component in the 93.5ghz image of pks  1421490 coincident with region a , the flux density of which we regard as being the total source flux density at this frequency , since the resolution of the shortest baseline larger than the source .",
    "the upper limit on flux density at 93.5@xmath21ghz for region b and c is 5@xmath21mjy ( 5 @xmath58 ) .    errors in the flux densities reported in table [ table : obs_info ] are dominated by uncertainties in the primary flux calibration which are estimated to be of order @xmath302@xmath55 at cm wavelengths , and of order @xmath3010@xmath55 at 3 mm .",
    "the hotspot is unresolved in the atca images , and is blended with emission from the surrounding regions .",
    "we are therefore unable to directly measure the flux density of the hotspot from the atca data . however , we are able to constrain the flux density of the hotspot , and we now discuss the methods used to obtain upper and lower limits .    using radio data that was first presented in @xcite , we find upper limits on the hotspot flux density at 17.7@xmath21ghz and 20.2@xmath21ghz by summing the clean components at the position of the hotspot .",
    "similarly , we obtain an upper limit to the hotspot flux density at 93.5@xmath21ghz from the measurement of total source flux density at that frequency .",
    "we obtain a lower limit on the hotspot flux density at 93.5  ghz via the following steps :    * we subtract the lba - measured hotspot flux density from the total source flux density at 2.3@xmath21ghz and 8.4@xmath21ghz to obtain two estimates of the non - hotspot flux density , from which we calculate a non - hotspot spectral index ( @xmath62(non - hotspot ) = 0.78 ) .",
    "* we extrapolate the non - hotspot power law to 93.5@xmath21ghz .",
    "* we reasonably assume that the non - hotspot spectrum becomes steeper towards higher frequencies .",
    "therefore the extrapolated flux density from step 2 is an upper limit to the non - hotspot flux density .",
    "* we subtract the non - hotspot upper limit from the observed entire source flux density to obtain a lower limit on the hotspot flux density at 93.5@xmath21ghz .    the assumption in step 3",
    "is based on the observation that the non - hotspot emission arises in the lobes , jets and the southern hotspot ( the core is negligible ) .",
    "jet and lobe spectra are often observed to steepen towards higher frequency .",
    "indeed , the 17.7@xmath21ghz and 20.2@xmath21ghz atca images indicate that the spectral index of the northern lobe region steepens significantly at higher frequency .",
    "the limits on hotspot flux density obtained from the atca images are represented by the tips of the arrows in figure [ fig : multiwavelength_plots ] , and are listed in table [ table : obs_info ] .",
    "optical spectra were taken with the magellan imacs camera on 14 may 2005 in service mode .",
    "three ten minute exposures were obtained using a long slit ( 09 width ) aligned with regions a and b. the 300 lines / mm grism was used , to yield a spectral resolution of @xmath63 spanning roughly 400010000  .",

    "no standard stars were observed , so no effort was made to flux calibrate the spectra or to remove telluric absorption features .",
    "no significant spectral features were detected in the spectrum of region a , consistent with synchrotron emission from a hotspot .",
    "however , only a very high equivalent width emission line could have been detected due to the low signal to noise ratio of these data .    the spectrum of region b contains several broad and narrow emission lines , which allowed a precise determination of the redshift ( see  [ sec : region_b_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this is not the first spectrum of the nucleus to be published  a spectrum of region b was presented in g05 .",
    "however , the spectrum presented in g05 did not allow identification of any spectral lines because the strongest spectral features fell beyond the wavelength coverage , and the spectrum was taken as a single short exposure with a high background due to the pre - dawn sky .",
    "the normalized optical spectrum of region b is displayed in figure [ fig : region_b_spectrum ] .",
    "we detect several broad and narrow emission lines : mg ii 2799 , [ ne v ] 3346 and 3426 , the blended [ o ii ] 3726,3729 doublet , [ ne iii ] 3869 and 3967 , h@xmath64 ( marginal ) , h@xmath65 , [ o iii ] 4363 , h@xmath66 , and [ o iii ] 4959 and 5007 .",

    "the narrow h@xmath66 line width is consistent with that of the oiii lines ( 510 km / s ) . from these features we measure the redshift @xmath67 .",
    "we did not detect the active galactic nucleus with the lba , but obtain an upper limit on the flux density of approximately 8@xmath21mjy at 2.3@xmath21ghz .",
    "this is consistent with the atca core flux density measurements ( see table [ table : obs_info ] ) .",
    "the core is completely dominated by its optical emission .",
    "in fact , the optical flux density is so great relative to the radio ( @xmath68 = 0.23 @xmath69 ) , the core would be classified as radio quiet in the strictest sense .",
    "the radio to optical spectral index can not be explained in terms of standard synchrotron self absorption models for flat radio spectra ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since this would require at least part of the jet to be self absorbed at optical wavelengths and would imply an unrealistically high magnetic field strength .",
    "this region has an optical spectral index @xmath70 , in the range typical of quasars @xcite , suggesting that the strong optical emission may be due to an unusually large contribution from the accretion disk thermal component .",
    "the radio to x - ray spectral index ( @xmath71 = 0.710 @xmath72 ) is typical of radio galaxies at similar redshift ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "there is clearly an excess of optical flux relative to the radio and x - ray flux when compared to samples of other radio galaxies ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to the results of numerical simulations , observational evidence also indicates that doppler beaming of hotspot emission may be significant .",
    "for example , the brighter and more compact hotspot is generally found on the side of the source with the brighter kpc - scale jet ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is more evident in samples of quasars than in samples including low power sources , which suggests that the observed correlation between hotspot brightness and jet brightness is related to doppler beaming @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that only moderate hotspot flow velocities ( @xmath221 ) are required to account for this observed correlation .",
    "@xcite found that regions of high surface brightness in the lobes of radio galaxies have flatter radio spectra on the side corresponding to the brighter jet .",
    "they suggest that doppler shifting of a curved hotspot spectrum may produce such a correlation .",
    "again , only moderate flow speeds of @xmath222 are required to account for this correlation @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that deceleration of a relativistic flow from @xmath223 to @xmath224 in hotspots can explain the wide range of observed hotspot seds as being purely an effect of source inclination .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have contested this interpretation .",
    "rather , they argue , the shape of the hotspot sed depends only on the hotspot radio luminosity .",
    "we now consider the angle to the line of sight for pks  1421490 , if doppler beaming is to be important .    the active galactic nucleus of pks  1421490 exhibits broad emission lines ( see  [ sec : region_b_spectrum ] ) .",
    "on the basis of the unified scheme for active galaxies , we therefore expect the angle to the line of sight to be less than @xmath3045@xmath225 @xcite .",
    "another indication of a small angle to the line of sight is the existence of a @xmath226 bend in the northern jet , approximately 5 arcseconds ( 35kpc ) from the agn at the western end of the ridge of emission extending west from the hotspot in figure [ fig : atca ] .",
    "such a large jet deflection is hard to understand if it is indicative of the true bending angle .",
    "the well known resolution to this problem is that the jet is viewed close to the line of sight , and the effect of projection causes a relatively small jet deflection to appear much larger than it actually is .",
    "we now consider the magnitude of the doppler factor that would be required to account for the various observed properties .",
    "let @xmath227 be the hotspot to counter hotspot flux density ratio , @xmath228 the bulk flow velocity in the hotspot divided by the speed of light , @xmath87 the jet angle to the line of sight , and @xmath229 the spectral index .",
    "if the two hotspots of pks  1421490 are identical , and the difference in flux density is purely the result of relativistic beaming , then    @xmath230    ( eg . * ? ?",
    "the observed hotspot to counter - hotspot flux density ratio is @xmath231 at 20.2@xmath21ghz , hence : @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 .",
    "a moderate lorentz factor of @xmath235 can account for the observed hotspot flux density ratio .",
    "the bend in the northern jet means that we can not assume the same inclination angle for the jet and counter - jet , so equation ( [ eqn : counter - hs_ratio ] ) does not strictly apply , but the above calculations serve to illustrate that the required lorentz factor is not large . if the jet is angled close to the line of sight , the real difference in inclination angle between jet and counter - jet may not be large .",
    "it should be noted that there is a difference between the times at which we see the two hotspots . in the case of pks  1421490",
    "this difference is approximately @xmath236yrs , where @xmath87 is the angle to the line of sight . in equation ( [ eqn : counter - hs_ratio ] )",
    "there is an implicit assumption that the brightness of the hotspots remain constant over a time - scale of approximately @xmath237 years .",
    "we summarize below the estimates of the doppler factor required to account for various properties of the hotspot .    * a bulk lorentz factor @xmath238",
    "is required to account for the observed hotspot to counter hotspot flux density ratio of @xmath216 . if the bend in the northern jet is such that a decrease in inclination angle is produced , the required bulk lorentz factor is lower . *",
    "a doppler factor @xmath239 is required to account for the observed lower limit on the break frequency @xmath240 ( see  [ sec : break_frequency ] ) .",
    "* a doppler factor @xmath241 is required to reduce the ssc model magnetic field strength to a value comparable to that calculated for other radio galaxies ( @xmath242 ) @xcite .",
    "however , such agreement is not essential since some variation in the radio galaxy population would be expected .      in  [",
    "sec : region_hs2 ] we argued that the broad emission to the west of the hotspot peak ( region hs2 ) may be associated with turbulent back - flow in the cocoon , and therefore can not be doppler beamed .",
    "as further discussed in  [ sec : region_hs2 ] , if the high surface brightness of region hs2 is not the result of doppler beaming , then it seems unreasonable to argue that the high surface brightness of region hs1 is the result of doppler beaming .",
    "another possible argument against doppler beaming comes from interpreting the radio polarization .",
    "figure [ fig:1421_pcntr ] is a contour map of the linearly polarized intensity at 20@xmath21ghz in the vicinity of the hotspot , with polarization position angle indicated by the vectors overlaid .",
    "the main peak in the contour map is associated with the hotspot ( regions hs1 and hs2 ) .",
    "the offset of the secondary peak relative to the main peak places it at the same position as region j1 in figure [ fig : lba ] .",
    "the position angle of the e - vectors in the hotspot indicate that the magnetic field ( perpendicular to the e - vectors ) is aligned nearly perpendicular to the jet direction .",
    "the magnetic field direction is often identified with the shock plane , because the component of the magnetic field in the plane of the shock is amplified , while the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the shock plane is conserved .",
    "figure [ fig:1421_pcntr ] therefore indicates that the terminal shock is not highly oblique .",
    "if the terminal shock is not highly oblique the post - shock velocity can not be highly relativistic unless the magnetic field is dynamically important ( see  [ sec : arguments_for ] and @xcite ) . if the magnetic field is dynamically important , this argument against doppler beaming based on the polarization position angle is not valid .    .",
    "the aim of this section is to consider the implications of the observed flattening in the hotspot radio spectrum discussed in  [ sec : low_frequency_flattening ] and illustrated in figure [ fig : plot_showing_flattening ] .",
    "we consider two possible mechanisms for producing a flattening in the electron energy distribution at @xmath243 .",
    "the first mechanism we consider is the dissipation of jet bulk kinetic energy .",
    "dissipation of the jet kinetic energy depletes low energy particles and produces a turn - over in the electron spectrum at a characteristic energy that depends on a number of parameters , including the jet lorentz factor .",
    "the second mechanism we consider is a transition between two distinct acceleration mechanisms .",
    "we note that the inferred value of @xmath7 is only weakly dependent on the assumed doppler factor @xmath64 because doppler beaming affects the calculation of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath244 ) as well as the rest frame emission frequency corresponding to @xmath7 ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is therefore approximately proportional to @xmath246 ( see table [ table : ssc_params ] ) .      as an illustrative calculation",
    ", we consider the dissipation of jet energy in a cold , un - magnetised proton / electron jet .",
    "the analysis is effectively done in two steps : first , we use the conservation of energy and particles to calculate the mean lorentz factor in the hotspot as a function of jet lorentz factor .",
    "we then relate the mean electron lorentz factor to the peak lorentz factor by assuming a particular form for the electron energy distribution .",
    "we do not specify the process by which the electrons and protons equilibrate .",
    "however , recent particle - in - cell simulations demonstrate that protons and electrons equilibrate in un - magnetised collisionless shocks @xcite .",
    "the aim of this calculation is to estimate the jet lorentz factor required to produce a turn - over in the electron energy distribution at @xmath243 if the jet bulk kinetic energy is carried by protons and efficiently transfered to electrons in the hotspot .",
    "this analysis can easily be extended to include different jet compositions , different proton to electron energy density ratios and the effects of the magnetic field .",
    "the relevant quantities are defined as follows : @xmath247 is the lorentz factor of an individual particle measured in the plasma rest frame , @xmath248 is the electron lorentz factor at the peak of the electron energy distribution , @xmath249 is the bulk lorentz factor of the plasma , @xmath250 is the corresponding plasma speed in units of the speed of light c , @xmath87 is the angle between the plasma velocity and the line of sight , @xmath112^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor , @xmath251 is the number density of electrons per unit lorentz factor , @xmath252 is the mean lorentz factor , @xmath253 is the number density , @xmath254 is the internal energy density , @xmath255 is the rest mass density in the plasma rest frame , @xmath256 is the pressure and @xmath257 is the relativistic enthalpy density .",
    "the relativistic enthalpy density is @xmath258    we assume the plasma is comprised of electrons ( subscript e ) and protons ( subscript p ) .",
    "quantities with the subscript 1 refer to the jet plasma , while quantities with a subscript 2 refer to the hotspot plasma .",
    "we assume that the relativistic enthalpy density in the jet is dominated by the rest mass energy density of the the proton component , so that @xmath259 .",
    "this assumption is valid provided @xmath260 .",
    "we assume that the electron population is ultra - relativistic ( @xmath261 ) , and that the proton population in the hotspot plasma is , at best , only mildly relativistic , and can be approximated as a thermal gas ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "we further assume that the protons and electrons equilibrate so that @xmath263 .",
    "hence , the hotspot pressure and enthalpy are @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "the equations for the conservation of energy and particles are , respectively @xmath266 where a is the jet cross - sectional area . dividing equation ( [ eqn : f_e ] ) by equation ( [ eqn : f_p ] ) ,",
    "we can write : @xmath267      combining equation ( [ eqn : f_e_on_f_p ] ) with our model assumptions described above",
    "we find @xmath268 where we have made the substitution @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "let us introduce the parameter @xmath271 which is the ratio of the mean electron lorentz factor in the hotspot ( @xmath272 ) to the electron lorentz factor at the peak of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "then @xmath273    in order to estimate the parameter @xmath274 we assume that the electron distribution below @xmath248 can be approximated by the low energy tail of a relativistic maxwellian , and above @xmath248 the electron distribution ( before cooling via synchrotron emission ) is a power - law extending from the peak to a maximum lorentz factor @xmath108 ( see figure [ fig : assumed_electron_distribution ] ) .    .",
    "@xmath275    using this particular form for the energy distribution , the value of @xmath274 is a function of the three parameters a , @xmath248 and @xmath106 .",

    "therefore in order to produce a turn - over in the electron energy distribution at @xmath243 the jet must have a bulk lorentz factor @xmath283 .",
    "this value of jet lorentz factor is consistent with jet lorentz factors inferred from modelling the radio to x - ray spectra of quasar jets on kpc - scales @xcite .",
    "if @xmath284 , or the jet contains some fraction of positron / electron pairs , or the electrons do not reach equilibrium with the protons , or we consider the effect of the magnetic field , then the energy requirements increase , and so too must @xmath285 .",
    "it was noted in  [ sec : intro ] that while only a small number of hotspots have provided direct estimates of @xmath7 , they are all distributed around a value of @xmath286 to within a factor of 2 ( excluding the value @xmath287 indirectly estimated by @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath274 is weakly dependent on the electron spectrum , and in general should be within the range @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , dissipation of bulk kinetic energy associated with relativistic proton / electron jets with bulk lorentz factors of order @xmath283 can provide a natural explanation for the inferred turn - overs in electron spectra at @xmath289 .",
    "our analysis indicates that the value of @xmath287 inferred by @xcite for the hotspot of the radio galaxy 6c0905 + 3955 would require a jet lorentz factor @xmath290 . if @xmath291 ( note that @xmath292 for this hotspot , and the synchrotron spectrum extends from radio through to soft x - ray frequencies @xcite ) , then the required jet lorentz factor is @xmath293 .",
    "let us now consider the case of a pure electron / positron jet . in this case , assuming an ultra - relativistic equation of state in the jet and hotspot , the ratio of equations ( [ eqn : f_e ] ) and ( [ eqn : f_p ] ) implies @xmath294 @xcite estimate a mean lorentz factor of @xmath295 in the jet of pks  0637752 .",
    "if a similar mean lorentz factor applies to the jet of pks  1421490 then the required jet bulk lorentz factor is @xmath296 .",
    "we now consider an alternative explanation for the flattening of the electron energy distribution . the observed change in slope may be the result of a transition between two different acceleration mechanisms : a pre - acceleration process producing a relatively flat electron spectrum at low energy , and diffusive shock acceleration acting at higher energy producing an electron distribution @xmath297 with @xmath298 .",
    "we have not modeled the spectrum in terms of such a scenario , but this model can not yet be ruled out .",
    "one interesting candidate for the pre - acceleration mechanism is that described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have shown that in a relativistic , magnetized , collisionless shock with an electron - positron - proton plasma there can be efficient transfer of energy from protons to leptons via the resonant emission and absorption of electromagnetic waves at high harmonics of the proton cyclotron frequency .",
    "this process produces a particle distribution described by a relativistic maxwell distribution at low energies ( @xmath299 ) and a relatively flat ( @xmath300 ) power - law component extending from @xmath301 to @xmath302 .",
    "the electron energy index of the power - law component is sensitive to the plasma composition .",
    "the theoretical maximum lorentz factor attained via this acceleration mechanism ( @xmath303 ) is set by resonance with the fundamental proton cyclotron frequency .",
    "however , the upper cut - off energy determined from the results of particle - in - cell simulations is somewhat lower than the theoretical maximum @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed flattening in the hotspot radio spectrum may be associated with a transition between the cyclotron resonant absorption mechanism and diffusive shock acceleration . @xcite",
    "have suggested this interpretation for the hotspot spectra in cygnus a.",

    "the isotropic x - ray luminosity of the hotspot , @xmath0 , is comparable to the isotropic x - ray luminosity of the entire x - ray jet of pks  0637752 , and the peak radio surface brightness is hundreds of times greater than that of the brightest hotspot in cygnus a. we successfully modeled the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution using a standard one - zone synchrotron self compton model with a near equipartition magnetic field strength of 3 mg .",
    "there is a strong brightness asymmetry between the approaching and receding hotspots , and the hot spot spectrum remains flat ( @xmath1 ) well beyond the predicted cooling break for a 3  mg magnetic field , indicating that the hotspot emission may be doppler beamed .",
    "we suggest that a high plasma velocity beyond the terminal jet shock could be the result of a dynamically important magnetic field in the jet , resulting in doppler boosted hotspot emission .",
    "however , some aspects of the hotspot morphology may argue against an interpretation involving significant doppler beaming .",
    "lba observations at 1.4  ghz will be required to further investigate the hotspot morphology .",
