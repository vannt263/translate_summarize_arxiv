    "the subject of this review is the combination of two central threads of quantum materials research .",
    "the first , correlated electron physics , is a venerable but still vibrant subject , born from observations of mott , hubbard , anderson , and others on the properties of @xmath1 transition metal oxides .",
    "it is largely concerned with the diverse properties of electronic materials which are insulating , or in the process of becoming so , as a result of electron - electron interactions @xcite , most importantly the strong local hubbard repulsion @xmath2 between electrons occupying the same orbital .",
    "a plethora of phenomena arises from correlated electron physics , including local moment formation and magnetism , correlated metallic states , quantum criticality , and unconventional superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the second thread , non - trivial physics from strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , includes a body of work on @xmath3-electron materials@xcite and the much more recent activity begun with the theoretical proposal of topological insulators ( tis ) in 2005@xcite .",
    "soc is a relativistic effect , which provides an interaction between the orbital angular momentum and electron spin in atoms , and is usually considered a small perturbation in the discussion of electrons in solid . however , in heavy elements it need not be weak  it effectively increases proportionally to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the atomic number  and indeed has striking qualitative effects . since 2005 ,",
    "the investigation of topological aspects of electron bands has exploded , both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . from the materials perspective",
    ", the domain of the ti field has mostly been the class of solids with heavy @xmath6- and @xmath7-electron elements such as bi , pb , sb , hg , and te . in these materials ,",
    "topologically protected dirac - like surface states have been predicted and observed , and a host of further phenomena are currently under intense investigation .",
    "the two research strands come together in the heavy transition metal compounds drawn especially from the @xmath8 series , and in some cases the @xmath9 s as well . upon descending the periodic table from the @xmath1",
    "to @xmath9 to the @xmath8 series , there are several competing trends .",
    "first , the @xmath0 orbitals become more extended , tending to reduce the electronic repulsion @xmath2 and thereby diminish correlation effects .",
    "however , simultaneously , the soc increases dramatically , leading to enhanced splittings between otherwise degenerate or nearly degenerate orbitals and bands , reducing in many cases the kinetic energy .",
    "the latter effect can offset the reduction in @xmath2 , allowing correlation physics to come into play .",
    "it is instructive to consider a generic model hamiltonian describing the above discussion : @xmath10 where @xmath11 in the annihilation operator for an electron in orbital @xmath12 at site @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the corresponding occupation number , @xmath15 the hopping amplitude , @xmath16 the atomic soc entangling spin ( @xmath17 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath2 the hubbard repulsion .",
    "an explicit example of the spin - orbital entanglement due to @xmath19 is given later in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_eff ] ) .",
    "we have for simplicity omitted the hund s interaction between spins in different orbitals on the same site , which is much smaller than @xmath2 but can sometimes have significant effects@xcite - it is , however , unimportant in the specific examples discussed in detail in this review . a schematic `` phase diagram ''",
    "can be drawn as in figure  [ fig : gen - pd ] in terms of the relative strength of the interaction @xmath20 and the soc @xmath21@xcite .",
    "we emphasize this is schematic , in part because the problem is unsolved , and in part because eq .   can represent many different physical situations by the choice of orbitals and lattice / band structure encoded in @xmath22 , and the ground states which occur certainly depend upon these choices . in this diagram , two lines ( which are not meant",
    "necessarily as sharp boundaries but rather as demarcating different limits ) divide the weak and strong correlation regions , and the weak and strong soc regimes , thereby generating four quadrants .",
    "conventional transition metal materials reside on the left hand side of the diagram , where soc is weak @xmath23 , and a conventional metal - insulator transition ( mit ) may occur when @xmath2 is comparable to the bandwidth , or a few times @xmath15 . upon increasing soc , when @xmath24 , a metallic or semi - conducting state at small @xmath2 may be converted to a semi - metal or to a ti . what happens when both soc and correlations are present ?",
    "several arguments suggest that @xmath16 and @xmath2 tend to cooperate rather than compete , in generating insulating states . including soc first",
    ", we have already remarked upon the splitting of degeneracies and the consequent generation of multiple narrow bands from relatively mixed ones .",
    "the narrow bands generated by soc are more susceptible to mott localization by @xmath2 , which implies that the horizontal boundary in figure  [ fig : gen - pd ] shifts downward with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "if we include correlations first , the @xmath2 tends to localize electrons , diminishing their kinetic energy .",
    "consequently the on - site soc @xmath16 , which is insensitive to or even reduced by _",
    "delocalization _ ,",
    "is relatively enhanced . indeed , in the strong mott regime @xmath25",
    ", one should compare @xmath16 with the spin exchange coupling @xmath26 , rather than @xmath15 . as a result , the vertical boundary shifts to the left for large @xmath20 .",
    "we see that there is an intermediate regime in which insulating states are obtained only from the combined influence of soc and correlations  these may be considered _ spin - orbit assisted mott insulators_. here we are using the term `` mott insulator '' to denote any state which is insulating by virtue of electron - electron interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we will remark briefly on a somewhat philosophical debate as to what should `` properly '' be called a mott insulator .     and",
    "soc @xmath21 .",
    "the materials in this review reside on the right half of the figure .",
    ", width=453 ]    terminology aside , an increasing number of experimental systems have appeared in recent years in this interesting correlated soc regime .",
    "most prolific are a collection of _ iridates _ , weakly conducting or insulating oxides containing iridium , primarily in the ir@xmath27 oxidation state .",
    "this includes a ruddlesdon - popper sequence of pseudo - cubic and planar perovskites sr@xmath28ir@xmath29o@xmath30 ( @xmath31)@xcite , hexagonal insulators ( na / li)@xmath32iro@xmath33@xcite , a large family of pyrochlores , @xmath34ir@xmath32o@xmath35@xcite , and some spinel - related structures@xcite . close to iridates in the periodic table",
    "are several osmium oxides such as naoso@xmath33@xcite and cd@xmath32os@xmath32o@xmath35@xcite , which experimentally display mits . apart from these materials where the microscopic soc is truly rather strong ( @xmath36 0.4ev ) ,",
    "there are also examples which arise in materials further `` up '' in figure  [ fig : gen - pd ] , in which electrons are strongly localized , the competing exchange scale is anomalously weak , making even smaller soc `` strong '' .",
    "this includes the spin - orbital liquid material fesc@xmath32s@xmath37@xcite , possibly the single layer vanadate sr@xmath32vo@xmath37@xcite , and a host of double perovskites , @xmath38o@xmath39@xcite , where the exchange scale is small because the electronically active @xmath40 ions are well separated spatially . for space reasons",
    ", we can not discuss all of these materials , but will take examples from this list as illustrations .",
    "this review is organized based on a consideration of two limits within this domain : the weak - to - intermediate correlation regime , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the bandwidth which is typically a few times @xmath15 , and the strong mott limit , @xmath43 , both in the presence of strong soc .",
    "conceptually , in the former , the electrons remain delocalized enough that band or band - like topology continues to play an important role , as in the case of tis@xcite .",
    "notably , interactions open up possibilities for new types of topological phases .",
    "this includes weyl semi - metals ( wsm ) with dirac - like bulk quasiparticles and surface  fermi - arc \" states@xcite , or axion insulators with unusual electromagnetic response@xcite , which can arise in the presence of spontaneous magnetic order .",
    "phase transitions between these states@xcite , and amongst metals and insulators , also occur in this regime , and yet more exotic phases have also been envisioned@xcite .",
    "we discuss this weak to intermediate correlation regime in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - interm - corr ] , taking the pyrochlore iridates , @xmath34ir@xmath32o@xmath35 , as primary experimental examples .    in the strong mott regime ,",
    "discussed in sec .",
    "[ strongu ] , electron band topology no longer plays a role , since electronic states are not extended .",
    "however , soc still offers new physics by fully or partially lifting orbital degeneracy of partially filled @xmath0 shells , not by ordering orbitals , but by _ entangling _ the orbital and spin degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "this provides a distinct mechanism to avoid the jahn - teller effect and classical orbital ordering .",
    "the orbital degeneracy may be fully lifted by soc , which occurs in iridates in the strong mott+soc limit , or partially lifted , which is the case for many @xmath44 or @xmath45 ions . in this review",
    "we illustrate both possibilities , taking the honeycomb iridates@xcite , na@xmath32iro@xmath33 and li@xmath32iro@xmath33 , as examples of the former , and double perovskites@xcite , as examples of the latter . in either case , the strong soc results in strongly anisotropic exchange interactions , and for the case of partial degeneracy lifting , these have a highly non - trivial _ multi - polar _ nature@xcite .",
    "we describe how these unusual interactions can promote large quantum fluctuations and lead to novel quantum ground states that are not possible without strong soc@xcite .",
    "in particular , quantum spin liquid and quadrupolar ( spin nematic ) ordered phases have been suggested to occur in these systems .",
    ".emergent quantum phases in correlated spin - orbit coupled materials .",
    "all phases have u(1 ) particle - conservation symmetry  _",
    "i.e. _  superconductivity is not included .",
    "abbreviations are as follows : tme = topological magnetoelectric effect , trs = time reversal symmetry , p = inversion ( parity ) , ( f)qhe = ( fractional ) quantum hall effect , lab = luttinger - abrikosov - beneslavskii@xcite .",
    "correlations are w - i = weak - intermediate , i = intermediate ( requiring magnetic order , say , but mean field - like ) , and s = strong .",
    "@xmath46 $ ] in a material s designation signifies a heterostructure with alternating @xmath47 and @xmath48 elements .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]     table  [ tbl : phases1 ] summarizes the emergent phases encountered in this review .",
    "the theoretical and experimental status of the weak - intermediate and strong correlation regimes are presented in sections  [ sec : weak - interm - corr ] and [ strongu ] , respectively . following this",
    ", we conclude the review with a discussion of open issues and other materials in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "following the discovery of topological insulators@xcite ( tis ) , it is now recognized that soc is an essential ingredient in forming certain topological phases .",
    "the ti is characterized by a @xmath49 topological invariant , which may be obtained from the band structure , in the presence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "this phase has a bulk excitation gap , but is distinguished from trivial band insulators by the presence of protected metallic surface states .",
    "the non - trivial bands in the ti must `` unwind '' upon crossing the interface with a time - reversal preserving vacuum or a trivial band insulator , leading to the closing of the excitation gap and a conducting state at the interface .",
    "stemming as it does from band structure considerations , the ti relies upon some degree of itineracy .",
    "other ti - related phases with gapless nodes  point fermi surfaces  in the bulk have also been explored theoretically , and obviously also require delocalized electronic states .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss phenomena involving band - like topology in the presence of interactions .",
    "non - trivial band topology can probably only arise when correlations are not so strong as to localize electrons fully to single atoms .",
    "consequently , we focus on this regime of weak to intermediate correlations . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this means that a hubbard model , rather than one of localized spins , is likely a better starting point .",
    "what new phenomena can be expected , relative to the uncorrelated @xmath6- and @xmath7-electron materials which are the mainstay of ti experiments ?",
    "tis obviously are stable to interactions , and quantitatively , correlations may even increase the gap in some cases ( with correlations , in contrast to the free case , the surface states have the potential of spontaneously breaking trs or even exhibiting exotic fractionalization@xcite ) .",
    "a more qualitatively novel prospect is to probe topological phases with spontaneous time - reversal breaking , since magnetism is common in correlated materials . in general",
    ", the @xmath49 classification fails for time - reversal broken systems , and instead chern insulators , _",
    "i.e. _  materials with quantized hall effects , may occur for instance . in the presence of crystalline symmetries , notably inversion ,",
    "a @xmath49 index may reappear@xcite .",
    "this is the case in the `` axion insulator''@xcite , which may be characterized by a quantized magnetoelectric effect , _",
    "i.e. _  an electric polarization @xmath50 can be generated by applying a magnetic field @xmath51 : @xmath52 with @xmath53 such that the ratio @xmath54 is universal and quantized .",
    "in fact the same is true for three - dimensional tis , and the quantized magnetoelectric effect can be used to define tis@xcite and axion insulators@xcite in the presence of interactions .",
    "non - trivial topology can also appear in gapless phases , such as in the wsm@xcite . at the level of band theory ,",
    "the wsm has a fermi surface consisting of points , where only two bands meet linearly , see figure  [ fig : nnn - bs ] .",
    "this implies that either trs or inversion is broken , for otherwise all bands would be two - fold degenerate . in this review",
    ", we will encounter examples arising from a spontaneous breaking of trs at sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "the band touchings of the wsm are three - dimensional analogs of the massless dirac fermions in clean graphene . however ,",
    "contrary to the latter , they should be regarded as topological objects  monopoles or hedgehogs in momentum space  because they act as sources of the momentum space berry flux@xcite .",
    "consequently , they always come in pairs with opposite chiralities , corresponding to a positive or negative monopole charge , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : nnn - bs ] .",
    "an isotropic example of a weyl fermion is given by the following bloch hamiltonian ( we take the touching to be at @xmath55 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 corresponds to positive / negative chirality and @xmath58 are the pauli matrices acting on the space of the two non - degenerate bands touching at the weyl point .",
    "because any local perturbation is a combination of pauli matrices , it can only move the touching in the brillouin zone ( bz ) and not lift it , since all @xmath58 already appear in @xmath59 . as a consequence of the non - trivial bulk topology , the wsm hosts non - trivial surface states on certain boundaries , which take the form of open fermi arcs@xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : weyl ] .",
    "this can not occur in a purely 2d system , just like the existence of an odd number of dirac fermions at the surface of a three - dimensional @xmath49 ti , which apparently violates the `` fermion doubling '' theorem@xcite . in both cases , however , the  partner \" electronic states exist on the opposite surface , which elegantly resolves the apparent paradox . for",
    "some further discussion of wsms , including other realizations,@xcite and of generalizations of these ideas to superconductors,@xcite we refer readers to recent reviews.@xcite    the chern insulator , axion insulator , and wsm require interactions to produce magnetic order , but once produced , a mean field description in terms of a static exchange field suffices , and the electronic quasiparticles are consequently weakly correlated .",
    "other phases arising in interacting systems with strong soc may be more intrinsically correlated .",
    "several interacting analogs of tis have been envisioned , which are not adiabatically connected to the ground states of _ any _ non - interacting electron hamiltonian , with or without broken symmetries .",
    "these include the topological mott insulator of ref .  , which exhibits _ spin - charge separation _ and ti - like surface states composed of neutral fermions , and _ fractional _",
    "chern insulators@xcite which display a fractional quantum hall effect without an external magnetic field .",
    "presently , while we believe the _ ingredients _ for these sorts of phases are present in the class of materials discussed in this review , a direct connection of specific compounds to specific states of this type is an open theoretical challenge .    a final category of phenomena to be mentioned in the intermediate correlation regime",
    "are thermal and quantum _",
    "phase transitions_. the elephant in the room is the mit itself , whose character in the strong soc limit has been very little investigated , but may be very different from what has been observed in traditional @xmath1 compounds . for example",
    ", theory has established that the mit may occur through an intermediate wsm state , and transitions to / from wsm states may be studied .",
    "other types of correlation - driven mits have been suggested .",
    "note that at @xmath60 , the difference between a metal and an insulator is quantitative not qualitative ( since @xmath61 always ) , so that the evolution from a metal to an insulator at @xmath60 needs not coincide with any phase transition .",
    "the onset of magnetic order in correlated metals and insulators constitutes another type of criticality .",
    "such transitions may again be affected by strong soc .      in this section",
    "we expand on the theory and experimental status of new phases and transitions in the context of the pyrochlore iridates , @xmath34ir@xmath32o@xmath35 ( @xmath62 - 227 ) where @xmath62 is a rare earth element .",
    "we choose these compounds because they comprise a large family for which experiments have revealed thermal phase transitions and an evolution from metallic to insulating states , and largely systematic variation of properties with @xmath62 .",
    "many key theoretical ideas in the field have also been introduced in this context , including topological mott insulators@xcite , chiral spin liquids@xcite , wsms@xcite , and axion insulators@xcite .",
    "this has contributed to a substantial experimental effort@xcite , in particular to determine the nature of the elusive magnetic ordering .",
    "we shall first review the experimental knowledge of the pyrochlore iridates , and will then describe the theoretical work they have motivated .",
    "the structure of these materials is well established , consisting of interpenetrating pyrochlore nets for both the rare earth and iridium ions@xcite .",
    "each such lattice can be described as a face centered cubic ( fcc ) bravais lattice with four sites per unit cell forming a tetrahedron .",
    "the crystal structure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pyro - xtal ] .",
    "the fcc lattice constant was found to range from @xmath63 to @xmath64  nm@xcite , depending on the @xmath62 element .",
    "another important structural parameter is the oxygen @xmath65-parameter , which determines the symmetry of the oxygen environment around each ir cation : when @xmath66 the oxygens form a perfect octahedron around each ir .",
    "otherwise , the oxygen octahedron becomes elongated ( @xmath67 ) or compressed ( @xmath68 ) along the @xmath69 $ ] directions .",
    "these distortions are called trigonal because they preserve three - fold rotational symmetries .",
    "experiments show that the pyrochlore iridates all have compressed octahedra@xcite .",
    "let us first review the temperature dependence of the resistivity , @xmath70 .",
    "all members of the family show a diverging @xmath70 at sufficiently low temperature , except pr-227@xcite .",
    "for the compounds with a larger @xmath71 ion such as eu- , sm- and nd-227 the resistivity goes from being `` metallic '' ( @xmath72 ) at large temperatures @xmath73 to `` non - metallic '' ( @xmath74 ) at smaller temperatures @xmath75 .",
    "this is illustrated for eu-227 in figure  [ fig : eu - data ] .",
    "pr-227 lies at the end of the spectrum in that it has the largest ionic radius , and does not show a major resistivity upturn down to the lowest temperatures , in agreement with the above trend . for compounds with smaller @xmath71 ions such as for @xmath76 lu ,",
    "yb , ho , y , etc the slope does not change sign and the resistivity is `` non - metallic '' throughout . in that case",
    ", the upturn at @xmath77 is smoother .",
    "one can tentatively explain this trend according to which a larger r@xmath78 cation leads to a more metallic @xmath70 as follows : larger @xmath71 ions lead to a decreased trigonal compression of the octahedra ( figure  [ fig : trig ] ) , which increases the ir - o orbital - overlap and thus facilitates the hopping of the ir electrons@xcite .",
    "a variety of sharp features in the magnetic properties occur at the same temperature as the resistivity upturn , @xmath77 , which support its interpretation as a true phase transition .",
    "most notably , the field cooled ( fc ) and zero - field cooled ( zfc ) magnetic susceptibilities branch away from each other@xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : eu - data ] for eu-227 .",
    "in addition , @xmath79sr experiments , which have been performed on eu-@xcite , nd-@xcite yb-@xcite , and y-227@xcite , show the continuous rise of a well - defined muon - precession frequency directly below @xmath77 ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : eu - data ] for eu-227 ) .",
    "this is indicative of long - range magnetic ordering into a commensurate structure .",
    "however , due to difficulties in performing neutron scattering experiments on ir - based compounds , the precise nature of the ordering remains unknown .",
    "nevertheless , it has been inferred that a _ second - order _ phase transition to an af insulator occurs at @xmath77 .",
    "ferromagnetism can be largely ruled out by the absence of magnetic hysteresis@xcite .",
    "the second order nature of the transition is further supported by the presence of peaks in the heat capacity at @xmath77@xcite .",
    "the essence of the experimental observations on the pyrochlore iridates is summarized in the phase diagram figure  [ fig : pyro - pd ] .",
    "the basic element of the description of these materials is the iridium electronic structure .",
    "we will neglect for the most part the rare earth magnetism , which plays a role in some ( but not all ) of the compounds at very low temperature .",
    "following the analysis of the ir - electron physics , we will briefly examine their interplay with local moments in section  [ sec : fd - exchange ] .",
    "we begin by examining the local atomic physics associated with the ir cations .",
    "the outer - shell electrons of ir@xmath27 are in a 5@xmath80 configuration , half - filling the ten @xmath0-levels .",
    "the dominant crystal field splitting comes from the oxygen octahedra surrounding each ir cation , which splits the levels into a higher energy @xmath81 orbital doublet and a lower @xmath82 orbital triplet , spanned by orbitals with @xmath83 and @xmath84 symmetry .",
    "these are separated by a @xmath85 ev gap and as such we can neglect the higher energy @xmath81 levels .",
    "we then must take into account both the soc and trigonal distortions .",
    "let us begin with atomic soc in ir@xmath27 ions .",
    "the full angular momentum operator @xmath86 projected to the @xmath82 manifold acts as an effective angular momentum one , @xmath87 , up to a minus sign , _",
    "@xmath88 , where @xmath89 represents the projection on the @xmath82 manifold .",
    "therefore , the soc @xmath16 splits the @xmath82 spinful manifold into a higher energy @xmath90 doublet and a lower @xmath91 quadruplet .",
    "the states in these multiplets exhibit spin - orbital entanglement .",
    "for example , the jeff = 1/2 states are @xmath92 in an ionic picture , since ir@xmath27 has 5 @xmath0-electrons , the @xmath90 doublet is half - filled , and only this orbital is involved in the low energy electronic structure .",
    "more generally , if trigonal splitting is included , the @xmath91 levels are split and mixed with the @xmath90 ones .",
    "in the general case , there is a highest kramers doublet , whose character varies with the ratio of soc to trigonal splitting , between a @xmath90 doublet and a @xmath93 one .",
    "a band structure view is complementary to the ionic picture as we now discuss .",
    "if only the highest doublet is involved , we expect 4 two - fold degenerate bands near the fermi energy , as there are 4 ir per unit cell . as discussed by wan",
    "_ et al._@xcite and yang _",
    "et al._@xcite , it is instructive to consider their structure at the @xmath94 point . due to cubic symmetry ,",
    "the 8 bloch states at this point decompose into 2 two - dimensional irreducible representations ( irreps ) and 1 four - dimensional irrep . by electron",
    "counting , these bands should be half - filled , so that if the order of these irreps , in terms of degeneracies , is 2 - 2 - 4 or 4 - 2 - 2 , a band insulating state may occur , while if the order is 2 - 4 - 2 , the 4-dimensional irrep must be half - filled and hence the system can not be gapped at the band structure level ( see the lowest panel of figure  [ fig : nnn - bs - tsig-08 ] ) .",
    "the former situation was obtained by ref .",
    "based on a phenomenological but ad - hoc hubbard model for small @xmath2 .",
    "they found a transition from a semi - metallic ground state to a ti one with increasing the ratio of soc to hopping .",
    "subsequently , by _ ab initio _ methods , wan",
    "_ et al._found@xcite the latter , 2 - 4 - 2 , ordering of irreps in y-227 . in this case",
    ", a ti is impossible , but other topological phases can occur with increasing correlations . for those iridates with metallic paramagnetic states ,",
    "the 2 - 4 - 2 scenario may be more plausible .",
    "a convenient tight - binding model which covers both limits was introduced in ref .  .",
    "it considers the minimal number of degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _  a single kramers doublet per site , which leads to a total of 8 bands .",
    "one can show that the most general nearest - neighbor ( nn ) trs hamiltonian has the form@xcite @xmath95 where the hopping parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 are real , and @xmath98 is a vector of pauli matrices acting on the pseudospin degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath97 term generates non - trivial berry phases for the hopping electrons , and will play a key role in realizing topological phases .",
    "the real vector @xmath99 is aligned along the opposite bond of the tetrahedron containing @xmath100 .",
    "diagonalization of @xmath101 reveals a semi - metallic state with the 2 - 4 - 2 ordering when @xmath102 , and a ti otherwise@xcite .",
    "notably , the semi - metallic state so obtained is not a compensated system with electron - hole pockets but a _ zero gap semiconductor_. more recently it was argued that such a state forms a stable _ non - fermi liquid _",
    "phase with a quadratic band touching at the @xmath94 point , christened a `` luttinger - abrikosov - beneslavskii '' ( lab ) phase for historical reasons.@xcite      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pyro - exp ] , the experimental results strongly suggest antiferromagnetic order in the low - temperature insulating state of the iridates .",
    "this is also indicated from theory .",
    "lda+u calculations by wan _",
    "et al . _  found an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state with each spin oriented along its local trigonal axis and all spins on a given tetrahedron pointing in or out of that tetrahedron@xcite .",
    "such an `` all - in / all - out '' ( aiao ) state , illustrated in figure  [ fig : hf ] , maintains the unit cell and cubic symmetry of the lattice , and is consistent with the lack of any indication of structural transitions in experiment .",
    "the same aiao state was obtained in a phenomenological hubbard model , by theoretical methods of varying sophistication ( refs .  ) .    in the magnetically ordered state ,",
    "the broken trs but preserved inversion symmetry admits the possibility of both wsm and axion insulator phases . wan _",
    "_  indeed found a wsm phase for a range of @xmath2 in their lda+u calculations , and suggested but did not find an axion insulator state@xcite .",
    "in fact , introduction of arbitrarily weak aiao magnetic order converts the quadratic band touching lab phase to a weyl semi - metal@xcite , which is illustrated in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : nnn - bs - tsig-08 ] . as remarked earlier , this phase is stable and indeed the weyl points must migrate from the @xmath94 point toward the zone boundary to pairwise annihilate before a true insulator is found at larger @xmath2 .",
    "such behavior was found by adding a hubbard repulsion @xmath2 to the tight - binding model of eq .",
    ", within a hartree - fock approximation@xcite ( small second neighbor hopping is needed to obtain the generic linear dispersion relation in the wsm phase with aiao order ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : hf ] .",
    "the quantitative width of the wsm in phase space varies between different calculations , and can be very narrow , owing to rather flat bands and the relatively fast growth of the local moment as the aiao phase is entered .",
    "other types of magnetic order , _",
    "e.g. _ ferromagnetism , can also induce weyl points , or relatives of them.@xcite    many signatures of the wsm have been suggested .",
    "we have already mentioned the surface fermi arcs . without disorder , the low frequency",
    "optical conductivity scales as @xmath103 .",
    "though a pair of opposite weyl points mediates an intrinsic hall conductivity@xcite , this sums to zero given the cubic symmetry of the aiao state , which dictates at least 8 nodes .",
    "however , it was suggested that a zero field hall conductivity could be induced by appropriate strain@xcite .",
    "interesting transport phenomena are predicted , related to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly of weyl fermions , in parallel electric and magnetic fields@xcite . in general , taking into account the interplay of various types of disorder , scattering , and interactions in the wsm makes modeling transport challenging .",
    "a nice point of consistency of the proposed aiao magnetic order is that it is characterized on landau symmetry grounds by a simple ising order parameter , for which a continuous thermal transition is allowed . as remarked earlier , the thermal mits indeed appear continuous in the experiments .",
    "adding finite temperature to the simple mean - field hubbard model calculation further corroborates the expectation from landau reasoning , showing that the magnetic transition is continuous , and its critical temperature grows with @xmath2 , following the behavior of the charge excitation gap@xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to study the corresponding thermal and quantum phase transitions in the future , for which the mean - field analysis may be inadequate .",
    "in the preceding , we considered correlations only at the mean field level .",

    "other qualitative effects of correlations exist .",

    "excitations and collective modes , which may be measured in the future by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) or other methods , typically mix elements of localized and itinerant systems in the intermediate correlation regime . of course , neither cdmft nor simpler hartree - fock theory are capable of capturing the more subtle quantum correlations in other proposed phases such as the topological mott insulator , but we do not know that such phases can be found in the iridates .",
    "we now briefly turn our attention to the interactions between the @xmath62-site @xmath3-electrons and the ir @xmath0-electrons . depending on the electronic configuration of the ion @xmath71 , the @xmath3-electrons can carry a net magnetic moment being in a kramers doublet ( @xmath104 nd , sm , gd , dy , yb ) or a non - kramers one ( pr , tb , ho ) .",
    "generally , if the ir ions magnetically order , the rare earth spins must experience an exchange field , and also order at low temperature .",
    "since @xmath105 spins are rather highly localized , the exchange coupling between rare earth and ir spins is expected , however , to be relatively weak , so the back - reaction on the ir dynamics would be expected to be small .",

    ", the physics of pr@xmath32ir@xmath32o@xmath35 remains unresolved .",
    "overall , much less theoretical attention has been paid to the physics of other rare earths @xmath62 , but one work suggests their coupling to ir may help to stabilize the wsm and axion insulator phases.@xcite      this section has outlined the theoretical and experimental work on the pyrochlore iridates . both support a picture of the high - temperature state as a paramagnetic semi - metal , possibly a zero gap semiconductor .",
    "the mit or crossover occurs simultaneously with the onset of commensurate magnetic order , most likely of aiao type . while the transport phenomenology in these materials is very complex , and clearly requires more theoretical modeling , the rough behavior of the resistivity is in accord with static and dynamical mean - field - theory results : the on - set of the aiao order would generally open up a charge gap in an otherwise metallic or semi - metallic paramagnetic state and the mit temperature would become smaller as the relative correlation strength @xmath20 gets weaker@xcite .",

    "a direct determination of the magnetic structure of each member of the series is desirable , to confirm or disprove the aiao for all or some compounds .",

    "we have focused above primarily on possible electronic phases , but it is also important to understand various experimental observables . in particular ,",
    "the excitation spectrum of the insulating and conducting states should be determined .",
    "an understanding of the effects of disorder and interactions on weyl fermions is demanded to confront spectroscopic studies . as an example , the optical conductivities of nd-227 and rh - doped nd-227 were recently measured@xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity of nd-227 has a striking charge gap while rh - doped nd-227 shows low - energy spectral weight that may be interpreted as an evidence for a wsm@xcite ( though in our opinion many other explanations are possible for the latter ) .",

    "direct examination of surface states by photoemission or tunneling is challenging but of great interest .",
    "in this section , we consider `` strong '' mott insulators , by which we mean materials for which it is sufficient to regard electrons as being localized effectively to single atoms , and a description in terms of local spin and orbital degrees of freedom applies .",
    "this requires _ a priori _ that the charge gap is large compared to the energy of spin and orbital excitations . in reality",
    ", spin - orbital exchange hamiltonians may also provide an intuitive description of some phenomena even in intermediate correlation situations , where charge fluctuations are significant .",
    "we will not comment further on this , and proceed with the strong mott discussion .",
    "the role of strong soc in the strong mott regime is clearly very different than that in more itinerant systems , since if electrons can be regarded as wholly localized , then considerations of _ band _ topology do not apply . in the strong mott regime , instead , the interesting physics of soc arises from the unique way in which it  wholly or partially  resolves _",
    "orbital degeneracy_. orbital degeneracy is germane to correlated materials , in which the environment of transition metal atoms often has at least approximate octahedral or tetrahedral symmetry , resulting in degenerate doublets or triplets of orbitals .",
    "when these shells are neither half - filled nor full , orbital degeneracy arises . _ in principle _ , this leads , even without soc , to interesting physics , in which the orbital degree of freedom behaves as an additional `` pseudo - spin '' quantum variable .",
    "the combined exchange of spin and pseudo - spin is given then by _ kugel - khomskii models_@xcite .",
    "in practice , the `` quantumness '' of the orbitals is usually compromised by the jahn - teller effect , in which lattice distortions spontaneously arise to split the orbital degeneracy @xcite .",
    "even at temperatures above this orbital ordering one , the associated phonon modes couple strongly to the orbital pseudo - spin , damping and decohering it .",
    "consequently , a sadly mundane reduction of the beautiful kugel - khomskii hamiltonian , by simply replacing the orbital pseudo - spin by its classical expectation value , seems to be adequate for the description of many orbitally degenerate transition metal systems , such as perovskite manganites . even in the rare situations",
    "in which something more subtle is suspected , the mixing of orbital and lattice modes makes it practically difficult to clearly distinguish collective orbital excitations in experiments .",
    "soc offers a more interesting way of resolving orbital degeneracy , trading the jahn - teller effect for _ entanglement _ of spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "it may entirely suppress the orbital degeneracy , leaving behind a pure kramers doublet , as in the case of the @xmath90 states of ir@xmath27 ions , or even selecting a spin - orbital singlet state for some non - kramers ions , as in the case of tetrahedral fe@xmath110@xcite .",
    "in other cases the degeneracy lifting may be partial , leading to effectively larger spin - orbital pseudo - spins . in either the kramers or the latter case ,",
    "the interactions amongst the remaining highly entangled states are strongly affected by this entanglement and the underlying spin - orbital exchange . consequently , not only do such systems ( at least largely ) avoid the jahn - teller effect , but they enjoy exotic exchange interactions which foster unusual ground states . in the remainder of this section , we will discuss in particular the possibilities of _ quantum spin liquid _ and _ multipolar ordered _ phases , as well as unconventional magnetically ordered states .",
    "we illustrate these possibilities through two material examples , the honeycomb iridates and the double perovskites .      as discussed already in sec .",
    "[ pyro ] , for an octahedrally coordinated ir@xmath27 ion with 5@xmath80 configuration , soc completely removes orbital degeneracy , resulting in a maximally quantum effective spin-1/2 hamiltonian , representing the @xmath111 states .",
    "one can say that the orbital degeneracy is fully lifted , the remaining degeneracy being guaranteed by kramers theorem .",
    "the hexagonal iridates na@xmath32iro@xmath33 and li@xmath32iro@xmath33 , which realize a layered structure consisting of a honeycomb lattice of ir@xmath27 ions , provide a concrete example of this case .",
    "both compounds appear to be in the strong mott regime .",
    "as shown by jackeli and khaliullin@xcite , in the ideal limit , the edge sharing octahedral structure and the structure of the entangled @xmath112 orbitals leads to a cancellation of the usually dominant antiferromagnetic oxygen - mediated exchange interactions .",
    "a sub - dominant term is generated by hund s coupling , which takes the form of highly anisotropic exchange : @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the effective spin-1/2 operators , and @xmath115 labels both spin components and the three orientations of links on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this peculiar and highly frustrated hamiltonian is , remarkably , nearly the only example of an exactly soluble model for a quantum spin liquid state !",
    "as shown in an ingenious and tour de force paper by alexei kitaev@xcite , it describes a state with no magnetic order and elementary excitations which are charge - neutral  spin \"- carrying majorana fermions that are their own anti - particles .",
    "it is astonishing that the kitaev exchange form of eq .  , which is very unnatural for conventional magnetic systems , arises organically from the geometry and entanglement in the strong soc limit .",
    "the experimental situation is more complex . in this@xcite and other@xcite contexts",
    ", it has been argued that an isotropic heisenberg interaction is generated from the direct overlap of 5@xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the resulting heisenberg - kitaev model has been studied by several methods , which demonstrate that with increasing heisenberg coupling the ground state undergoes successive transitions from the kitaev spin liquid to a `` stripy '' four - sublattice magnetically ordered state , to the usual two sublattice one .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments and other studies show that the ground state of na@xmath32iro@xmath33 is , however , none of these states , but instead displays a different collinear magnetic order , the so - called zig - zag state with a four - sublattice structure@xcite .",
    "this has generated a number of new theoretical proposals to explain the apparent departure from the heisenberg - kitaev model@xcite .",
    "possibly important ingredients are other symmetry - allowed interactions on nearest - neighbor bonds , which might emerge from trigonal crystal fields or other mechanisms , and exchange with second and third neighbor sites .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the kitaev interaction might be much larger in li@xmath32iro@xmath33 and the system may be closer to the quantum spin liquid phase@xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to comment on the role of frustration .",
    "often in antiferromagnets , soc , for example via the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , is thought to remove accidental degeneracy and favor order .",
    "the kitaev model is a counterexample , showing that in some cases strong soc can suppress ordering .",
    "however , one should be aware of both possibilities .",
    "in other situations , soc may reduce but not eliminate fully the orbital degeneracy .",
    "such partial degeneracy removal still has dramatic effects upon the physics . as an example",
    ", we consider a family of compounds with one or two electrons in the 4@xmath0 or 5@xmath0 shell .",
    "these are thus moderate to strongly spin - orbit coupled analogs of the very well studied @xmath1 titanates with ti@xmath78 and vanadates with v@xmath78 or v@xmath27 states .",
    "the latter materials constitute classic families undergoing mott transitions@xcite . in octahedral coordination and for vanishing soc",
    ", these valence states possess a three - fold orbital degeneracy , and consequently are jahn - teller active in the solid and tend to exhibit complex orbitally ordered states .",
    "when soc is dominant , we can understand the partial degeneracy lifting as follows .",
    "the @xmath82 orbitals split just as in iridates , but with the 1 or 2 electrons occupying now the @xmath91 quadruplet . in the @xmath44 case , this simply results in a @xmath91 local effective spin . in the case of the @xmath45 electron configuration ,",
    "the description based purely on single - particle states no longer holds , but the result is similar .",
    "following hund s rules applied to the @xmath45 configuration , one finds a total spin @xmath116 and an effective orbital angular momentum ( three - fold degeneracy ) @xmath117 . in the end @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "align , so that an effective @xmath120 spin results when soc is included@xcite .",
    "we see that in both cases , the ionic degeneracy ( @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively ) is reduced from that without soc ( @xmath124 , respectively ) , but is still larger than what is required by kramers theorem alone ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "what physics can we expect from the effective spins ?",
    "`` large '' spins such as @xmath126 are often thought to behave relatively classically .",
    "this is based on the standard spin wave expansion for heisenberg - type models , which indeed can be cast as an expansion in @xmath127 .",
    "however , the classicality of such spins in fact depends critically on the nature of their interactions .",
    "many examples of non - classical behavior for larger spins can be found in the theoretical literature , notably spin - nematic or quadrupolar ordered phases of spin one systems with biquadratic exchange@xcite , haldane type states for @xmath128 aklt models@xcite , and quantum spin liquid states of large @xmath129 su(n ) and sp(n ) antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "all these cases can be cast in the form of models in which spins with @xmath130 interact with _ higher order exchange _ interactions involving multiple spin operators on each site ( but typically with spins still interacting pairwise ) .",
    "one can describe such interactions as consisting of coupling between _ multipole _ moments ( beyond dipoles ) of the spins .",
    "heuristically , multipolar interactions enhance quantum fluctuations because they connect directly states with very different @xmath131 quantum numbers , allowing the wavefunction to easily delocalize in the spin space . by contrast , the usual bilinear heisenberg interactions induce only single spin flips , and consequently tend to localize the spin wavefunction near some classical extremum .    unfortunately , multipolar interactions are very weak in conventional systems with weak soc . however , this is not true for the effective spins in the strong soc limit .",
    "this is because spin exchange is _ always _ dependent on the orbital state , and in the strong soc limit spins and orbitals are highly entangled .",
    "this entanglement transfers the orbital dependence of the exchange to the effective spin , generating multipolar exchange , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : multipolar - exchange ] .",
    "thus for spin - orbitally entangled effective spins , _",
    "strong multipolar exchange is generic_. we illustrate this in the following subsections for one class of materials .      for numerous examples of",
    "partially quenched degeneracy of the above type , we turn to the double perovskite materials , @xmath38o@xmath39 , whose structure is shown in figure  [ fig : fig0 ] .",

    "there are many such compounds with non - magnetic @xmath48 sites and @xmath40 sites occupied by the 4@xmath0 and/or 5@xmath0 transition metal elements with @xmath122 or @xmath123 configuration . because of the difference in the valence charges and ionic radius between @xmath48 and @xmath40 ions , the magnetic @xmath40 ions form an fcc lattice structure with very little intersite disorder , and the lattice constant twice that of the original cubic case . as shown in table [ tab2 ] , the magnetic ions @xmath40",

    ", such heavy elements and high orbital shells naturally incorporate strong soc .",
    "moreover , the large separation of the metal ions in this structure suppresses electron hopping and promotes mott insulating behavior .",
    "immediate evidence for orbital degeneracy lifting can be found in several of these materials .",
    "one consequence of the strong soc limit is a reduction of the effective moment . for the @xmath91 state , in fact , in an ideal isolated ion , the orbital and spin contributions cancel , and the moment _ vanishes _ , _ i.e. _  the g - factor is zero ! due to mixing with neighboring oxygen ions ,",

    "this difference between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 cases occurs because within weiss mean field theory , a kramers ion such as @xmath44 must always break time reversal symmetry at @xmath183 to avoid ground state degeneracy .",
    "as remarked earlier , multipolar interactions tend to destabilize conventional , magnetically ordered semiclassical ground states . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because they contain many more `` spin flip '' terms analogous to the @xmath194 couplings which are part of the usual heisenberg two spin interactions .",
    "quantum disordered ground states can be established rigorously for aklt models@xcite , which have specially tuned su(2 ) invariant hamiltonians which can be written entirely in terms of a positive semi - definite sum of projection operators .",
    "they can also be found in a controlled manner for large @xmath129 models with enlarged su(@xmath129 ) or sp(@xmath129 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "neither approach can be directly applied here , but it is clear that the multipolar hamiltonians which occur naturally for @xmath44 and @xmath45 systems are somewhat intermediate between conventional spin models and these special cases .",
    "thus in frustrated geometries , quantum disordered states may well obtain .",
    "a simple way to check for disordered states is to gauge the magnitude of quantum fluctuations within a spin - wave expansion ( generalized for multipolar phases ) about the mean field states . indeed using a generalized holstein - primakoff spin wave theory ,",
    "it is shown that quantum fluctuations are strong when @xmath186 and @xmath187 are small @xcite .",
    "this strongly points to effects beyond mean field , and the likelihood of a non - magnetic ground state . by examining various limits ,",
    "both valence bond solid and quantum spin liquid states were proposed for this region of the phase diagram of the @xmath44 systems in ref .  .",
    "further quantitative study of models of this type would be highly desirable , but this is challenging and probably requires at least significant extension of existing numerical methods .",
    "other theoretical work has considered the effects of non - cubic crystal fields , which split the quadruplet ground state to form a low energy doublet .",
    "this then reduces to an effective @xmath93 model , but with highly anisotropic interactions with anisotropy depending on the bond orientation .",
    "the resulting exchange model may be strongly frustrated .",
    "in such cases , quantum fluctuations may also support a quantum spin liquid phase @xcite , which is amenable to analysis by more conventional methods .",
    "a detailed discussion about the applications of theory to experiment , and on specific materials , can be found in ref .   and",
    "here we comment just on a few examples for which strong soc phenomenology is most compelling .",
    "in general , for the strong soc limit to apply , both non - cubic crystal fields and exchange interactions should be small compared to the spin orbit splitting .",
    "the latter is of order 100  mev for 4@xmath0 materials like mo@xmath135 , and a few times larger for the 5@xmath0 materials .",
    "this is quite large compared to exchange interactions in double perovskites , but not necessarily large compared to crystal field perturbations in non - cubic crystals .",
    "thus we focus on cases where at least elastic x - ray scattering measurements find a cubic structure .",
    "this presumably indicates the absence of a static jahn - teller effect , though the dynamic or non - uniform effects of jahn - teller phonon coupling may still be important .",
    "we have already mentioned ba@xmath32ymoo@xmath39 , which remains cubic to low temperatures and has a magnetic entropy approximately equal to @xmath195 , consistent with a @xmath196 local moment@xcite .",
    "this material avoids any apparent phase transitions down to 2  k , despite rather strong antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "an energy gap is indicated in recent nmr and inelastic neutron scattering measurements , which may be associated with valence bond formation@xcite .",
    "an unusual feature seen in this material , which occurs in a number of double perovskites , is the existence of _ two _ curie regimes in the magnetic susceptibility : above 100  k and below 50  k@xcite .",
    "this is suggestive of some single - ion anisotropy , which would explain the existence of two curie regimes because it splits the 4-fold degeneracy of the @xmath196 states but leaves a 2-fold kramers doublet at temperatures below 50  k , which still gives a curie signal .",
    "this could perhaps be associated with quadrupolar order , or to a lattice driven distortion .",
    "the macroscopic cubic symmetry appears at odds with the latter , but a set of random local distortions with statistical cubic symmetry might be a possibility .",
    "more recent experiments have observed the emergence of additional phonon mode below 130  k , consistent with a local structural change@xcite .",
    "a second example is ba@xmath32naoso@xmath39 , for which the ground state below 6.8  k was found to be ferromagnetic with easy axis along the [ 110 ] direction@xcite .",
    "the [ 110 ] easy axis is quite unusual , and indeed does not occur in standard landau theory for ferromagnets , in which weak cubic anisotropy ( quartic terms ) always selects either a [ 100 ] or [ 111 ] axis .",
    "this is a strong indication for some correct element in the strong soc description , which indeed predicts [ 110 ] ferromagnetism to be dominant , due to the quadrupolar mechanism .",
    "experimental confirmation would require measurement of a structure change associated to the quadrupolar ordering , which so far has not been observed .",
    "however , several other indications are in favor of quadrupolar ordering @xcite .",
    "the investigation of correlated electron systems with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is still in its infancy . in this review",
    ", we summarized and explained recent developments in theoretical and experimental research in this rapidly growing area .",
    "we show that soc tends to act with coulomb interactions to enhance the degree of electron correlations , producing spin - orbit - assisted mott insulators . in",
    "the weak to intermediate correlation regime , we described possible electronic states with topological band structures .",
    "when correlations are strong enough that a local moment description applies , we discussed how spin liquid and multipolar phases may occur due to spin - orbital entanglement .",
    "we explored possible applications to pyrochlore iridates in the weak - to - intermediate correlation regime , and honeycomb iridates and double - perovskites with 4@xmath0/5@xmath0 transition metal elements in the strong mott regime .    due to space limitations ,",
    "many important systems were not discussed .",
    "this includes the ruddlesdon - popper series of perovskite iridates@xcite , sr@xmath28ir@xmath29o@xmath30 , whose @xmath197 members are some of the most investigated materials in this class . in particular , sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 warrants special attention as an approximate homolog of the parent material of some of the high - t@xmath198 cuprates , la@xmath32cuo@xmath37 . like the latter",
    ", sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 is an antiferromagnetic insulator@xcite , with a very large exchange constant @xmath199  k@xcite , somewhat smaller than but comparable to that of the cuprates , and a charge gap @xmath200  mev or @xmath201  k , many times larger than @xmath202 .",
    "both sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 and sr@xmath33ir@xmath32o@xmath35 have served as striking examples of the power of modern rixs , which is remarkably suited for @xmath8 compounds@xcite .",
    "rixs has provided a direct probe of spin and orbital states and dynamics . by rixs",
    ", it has been possible to test and confirm the @xmath90 character of the ir@xmath27 state in sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 @xcite and to measure the full spin - wave dispersion in both compounds@xcite .",
    "such measurements reinforce the analogy of sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 to the cuprates , and have motivated a strong push to _ dope _",
    "this material@xcite in hopes of finding high - temperature superconductivity , pseudo - gap behavior , etc , as also suggested theoretically@xcite .",
    "this program is very much underway , though at the time of this writing superconductivity has not been found .",
    "in general , doping of correlated insulators with strong soc is a very interesting subject . in the traditional venue ,",
    "the mott metal - insulator _ quantum _ phase transition may be tuned either by bandwidth control at fixed stoichiometric filling , or by filling control , varying the carrier density , and these two types of mott transitions have quite distinct characters@xcite . in this review",
    "we have already remarked upon the seemingly distinct behavior of the bandwidth controlled transition ( and the thermal transition at fixed filling ) in the strong soc regime from the usual strong first order one in @xmath1 transition metal compounds .",
    "it may be that the filling controlled transitions are also qualitatively different in the strong soc case .",
    "there is very little theoretical work on this problem@xcite , which promises to be a rich subject for future study , and not only in sr@xmath32iro@xmath37 .",
    "another important topic which has been mentioned but not given in depth attention in this review is the emergence of fractionalized exotic phases from topological bands .",
    "this possibility is vetted experimentally and theoretically by the most studied fractionalized states of matter , the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) state of two - dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields .",
    "the landau levels of that problem can be view as the simplest examples of bands with non - trivial chern number , and it is understood that the fqhe originates from interacting electrons that partial fill a landau level .",
    "many theorists have suggested that fqhe may occur due to fractionally filled bands with non - trivial chern number in crystalline materials with broken time - reversal symmetry : a fractional chern insulator@xcite .",
    "time - reversal symmetric fractional topological insulators@xcite have also been proposed in both 2d and 3d , as have other fractionalized phases such as the topological mott insulator@xcite . while current theoretical understanding demonstrates clearly that all these phases _ may _ exist , _",
    "i.e. _  that they are stable phases of matter for some hamiltonian parameters , they are all outside the domain of conventional mean field approaches , including those combined with _",
    "ab initio _ methods such as lda+u and dmft .",
    "for many of the other phases described in this review , however , mean field approaches are adequate .    also beyond these mean field approaches are numerous possible quantum critical points ( as well as thermal ones ) .",
    "the rich variety of phases found already in the studies discussed in this review implies that suitable phase transitions between these phases should be accessible .",
    "this includes of course mits , but also transitions to the onset of magnetic order , and between different types of band topology . in many experimental systems with weak soc , quantum criticality",
    "is seen to coincide with unconventional superconductivity , and many believe the former is a causative factor in the latter@xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting to seek superconductivity from quantum critical fluctuations in strong soc materials , and if it exists , to see whether topological superconductivity might result .",
    "experimentally , strong soc tightens the link between electronic and lattice structure , so that a very strong influence of pressure / strain may be expected in these materials .",
    "we anticipate a growing number of studies of criticality in this class of systems .    as in any developing field , there are controversies .",
    "the @xmath112 limit is actively debated in different iridates .",
    "the degree of spin - orbital entanglement can be addressed by several distinct experiments , and should vary from material to material , depending upon the strength of crystal fields , etc . while the @xmath112 picture is appealing and simple , it is probably , however , not essential to many of the phenomena we have discussed . also at issue is the nature of the correlated insulating state .",
    "some authors distinguish `` mott '' and `` slater '' insulators , where in the latter case insulating behavior is due to magnetic order .",
    "it is not clear whether this distinction is well - defined , especially at zero temperature , given that magnetic order itself can arise only from coulomb interactions . in general",
    ", there is no reason to have a phase transition as the interaction strength is increased up to the local moment regime , if the magnetic ordering pattern is unchanged .",
    "different experiments@xcite that try to differentiate the two may be formulated : is the system conducting or insulating above the magnetically ordering temperature ? is the charge gap @xmath203 large compared to the exchange @xmath202 ? is the mit continuous or first order ?",
    "these criteria need not agree .",
    "a related issue is the `` degree of correlation '' in , _",
    "e.g. _  iridates , with presumably slater insulators being less correlated .",
    "this question is typically posed by _ ab initio _ based approaches such as lda+u or dmft .",
    "we remark that by these techniques , even the correlation strength of high - t@xmath198 cuprates might be questioned@xcite , so the physical significance of this question is opaque to us . finally , the strong soc limit itself is open to question .",
    "the strong soc limit indeed depends not only upon the ratio of soc to non - cubic crystal fields , but also on the strength of hopping or exchange relative to soc .",
    "_  have suggested indeed that soc is not critical to the insulating state in na@xmath32iro@xmath33@xcite .    moving beyond these debates , perhaps one of the most ambitious programs for the future is `` engineering '' desired electronic states .",
    "an appealing possibility is combining the materials discussed in this review with advances in layer by layer atomic growth of oxides to produce designer heterostructures of iridates and other strong soc systems .",
    "for example , various heterostructures of perovskites@xcite , ( including sriro@xmath33 ) as well as of @xmath34ir@xmath32o@xmath35 along the [ 111 ] direction@xcite have been proposed and several non - trivial phases such as topological insulators and quantum hall states are predicted to exist under certain conditions .",
    "experiments of this type are within the realm of possibility in the near future .    at the time of writing",
    ", the materials synthesis and experimental characterization of diverse 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal oxides is only increasing .",
    "the effects of carrier doping , hydrostatic pressure , and high magnetic fields are under investigation .",
    "the outcome of these experiments and existing and future theory may uncover entirely new classes of many - body quantum ground states in strongly spin - orbit coupled systems .",

    "<S> we discuss phenomena arising from the combined influence of electron correlation and spin - orbit coupling , with an emphasis on emergent quantum phases and transitions in heavy transition metal compounds with 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 elements . </S>",
    "<S> a common theme is the influence of spin - orbital entanglement produced by spin - orbit coupling , which influences the electronic and magnetic structure . in the weak - to - intermediate correlation regime , </S>",
    "<S> we show how non - trivial band - like topology leads to a plethora of phases related to topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we expound these ideas using the example of pyrochlore iridates , showing how many novel phases such as the weyl semi - metal , axion insulator , topological mott insulator , and topological insulators may arise in this context . in the strong correlation regime </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that spin - orbital entanglement fully or partially removes orbital degeneracy , reducing or avoiding the normally ubiquitous jahn - teller effect . </S>",
    "<S> as we illustrate for the honeycomb lattice iridates and double perovskites , this leads to enhanced quantum fluctuations of the spin - orbital entangled states and the chance to promote exotic quantum spin liquid and multi - polar ordered ground states . connections to experiments , materials , and future directions </S>",
