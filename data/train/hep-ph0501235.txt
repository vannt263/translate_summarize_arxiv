    "the production of heavy quarkonium offers a unique perspective into the process of hadronization , because the creation of the relevant valence partons , the heavy quarks , is essentially perturbative .",
    "quarkonium production and decay have been the subject of a vast theoretical literature and of intensive experimental study , in which the effective field theory nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite has played a guiding role .",
    "nrqcd offers a systematic formalism to separate dynamics at the perturbative mass scale of the heavy quarks from nonperturbative dynamics , through an expansion in relative velocity within the pair forming the bound state . in nrqcd",
    ", the description of the relevant nonperturbative dynamics is reduced to the determination of a limited number of qcd matrix elements , accessible from experiment and , in principle , lattice computation .",
    "a characteristic feature of the application of nrqcd to production processes is the indispensible role of color octet matrix elements , which describe the nonperturbative transition of quark pairs in adjoint representation into quarkonia through soft gluon emission .",
    "an early success of nrqcd was to provide a framework for the striking tevatron run i data on high-@xmath2 heavy quarkonium production @xcite , and it has been extensively applied to heavy quarkonia in both collider and fixed target experiments . a wide - ranging review of theory and experiment for quarkonium production and decay has been given recently in ref .",
    "much of the analysis has been based on a factorization formalism proposed in @xcite , which offers a systematic procedure for the application of nrqcd to quarkonium production .",
    "it is fair to say , however , that , in contrast to quarkonium decay , fully convincing arguments have not yet been given for nrqcd factorization as applied to high-@xmath2 production processes @xcite .",
    "this omission may or may not be related to the current lack of confirmation for its predictions on quarkonium polarization at high @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper , we summarize progress toward the derivation of an appropriate factorization formalism for high-@xmath2 quarkonia , illustrating our considerations with results on infrared emission at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . at nnlo",
    "we find infrared divergences that do not fall precisely into the pattern suggested in ref .",
    "these divergences may , however , be incorporated into color octet matrix elements by a technical redefinition that makes the latter gauge invariant .",
    "it is not clear whether this pattern extends beyond nnlo , and we conclude that nrqcd factorization must be examined further for production processes . in any case ,",
    "all our results are consistent with the factorization of evolution logarithms in the ratio of momentum transfer to quark mass from nonperturbative matrix elements @xcite .    in the results presented below",
    ", the relevant infrared divergence is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the relative velocity of the heavy pair in the quarkonium rest frame .",
    "the rotational invariance of this result ( in the quarkonium rest frame ) makes it possible to match the long - distance behavior of an arbitrary cross section to an octet matrix element in a manner that does not depend on the directions of energetic final - state gluons . in other words",
    ", we may factorize the perturbative long - distance contributions from the short - distance cross section , and replace them with a universal nonperturbative matrix element that has the same perturbative long - distance behavior , just as proposed in @xcite and extended in @xcite .",
    "we begin our discussion with a brief review of nrqcd factorization at high transverse momentum .",
    "we discuss for definiteness the production of the @xmath5 and related heavy quarkonium states @xmath6 in leptonic or hadronic collisions , @xmath7 . to leading power in @xmath8 , which we assume to be a small parameter , production proceeds through gluon fragmentation . according to conventional factorization theorems @xcite",

    "is denoted by @xmath12 , and we have absorbed all information on the initial state into @xmath13 .",

    ", we will study the fragmentation function itself , concentrating on infrared divergences at nnlo .",
    "first , however , we make some observations concerning the gauge transformation properties of nrqcd color octet matrix elements .",

    "although the heavy ( anti)quark fields ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 are all at the same space - time point ( here @xmath26 ) , the operator @xmath27 is not truly local , because the operator @xmath28 creates particle @xmath6 for out states , in the far future . in particular , operator - valued gauge transformations do not commute with the product @xmath29 in general .",
    "a consequence of nonlocality is that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ondef1 ] ) is not gauge invariant in perturbation theory unless the individual product @xmath30 and @xmath31 are separately invariant .",
    "this is the case when the @xmath22 s specify color singlets , but not when they specify color octets .",
    "a related issue arises in the field - theoretic definitions of fragmentation functions @xcite , such as @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ cofact ] ) above .",
    "it is resolved by supplementing the bi - local products of fields by nonabelian phase operators , or wilson lines : @xmath33 = \\exp \\left[-ig\\int_0^\\infty d\\lambda\\ ,   l \\cdot a(x+\\lambda l ) \\right]$ ] .",
    "in contrast to parton distributions , moments of fragmentation functions do not result in expectation values of local operators @xcite , and the corresponding wilson lines are not guaranteed to cancel identically . for a color octet combination ,",
    "the gauge field @xmath34 is given in adjoint representation , just as for a gluon fragmentation function , for which the operator @xmath35 multiplies the gauge covariant field strength @xmath36 . to be definite , and for convenience in relating nrqcd operators to the gluon fragmentation function , we will choose @xmath37 as a lightlike vector in the minus directon : @xmath38 .",
    "our gauge invariant redefinition of production operators in octet representation is now found by the replacement ( which we refer to as a gauge completion ) , ^h_n(0 ) ^_n , c(0 ) _ l^ [ 0,a]_cb(a^_ha_h ) _ l [ 0,a]_ba ^_n , a(0 ) , [ replace ] where we have exhibited the color indices of the octets . in perturbation theory ,",

    "the full fragmentation function is found by cutting the remaining lines in all possible ways . when the gluon is cut in fig .  1b ,",
    "in particular , the resulting diagrams have an uncancelled infrared pole in dimensional regularization , beginning at order @xmath58 when the gluon momentum @xmath59 .",

    "an advantage of this expansion is that , because the field strength decouples from scalar polarized lines , all singularities associated with gluon momenta collinear to @xmath67 vanish on a diagram - by - diagram basis , and double poles in @xmath68 are entirely absent in the calculation . by the same token ,",
    "the integral in ( [ nlopt ] ) is gauge invariant in the polarization sum for the final - state gluon of fig .",
    "finally , in fig ,  1c , the soft gluon connects the pair to the wilson line .",
    "in covariant gauges , this diagram has double and single infrared / collinear poles in dimensional regularization .",

    "@xcite as an essential step in the justification of nrqcd factorization for production cross sections .",
    "to the extent that all the infrared poles of diagrams that do not share the topology of nrqcd matrix elements cancel , the matching of perturbative infrared poles with those of the effective theory is ensured .",
    "the result of this cancellation is referred to as topological factorization @xcite .",
    "the same considerations that lead to the inclusion of nonabelian phases to the fragmentation function , however , suggest that the cancellation of non - factored soft gluons may be nontrivial , and should be checked beyond nlo .",
    "of course , a full nnlo calculation of either cross sections or fragmentation functions would be daunting .",
    "fortunately , the analysis of the relevant infrared behavior at nnlo requires only the eikonal approximation , and is therefore a much more manageable , although still extensive , task , to which we now turn .",
    "we can readily generalize our nlo discussion to nnlo . once again , because we are interested in gluons whose energies are much less that @xmath50 , we can adopt the eikonal approximation , and neglect all dynamics at the scale of the quark masses . in nrqcd , these approximations are relevant to gluons of order @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the relative velocity , but of course in the perturbative calculation the gluon momentum goes to zero .",
    "we note that for octet - singlet transitions at nnlo , we need not include virtual gluon exchange between the quark and antiquark , except for diagrams that are already topologically factorized . as a result , we will not need not consider violations of the eikonal approximation from momentum regions at or below the scale @xmath71 , or the resulting @xmath72 singular behavior .",
    "representative diagrams for the fragmentation function are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the full infrared fragmentation function is again generated by taking all allowed cuts of the remaining lines of each such diagram .",
    "we are concerned only with diagrams that connect octet to singlet quark states , and which are not topologically factorized , since these are the potential sources of nonfactoring behavior in both the fragmentation function and related cross sections .",
    "we recall once more that the familiar argument for nrqcd factorization is based on the conjecture that all infrared regions in these diagrams cancel after this limited sum over cuts @xcite . in fact , we shall see that this is the case at nnlo only if we employ the gauge - completed definitions for nrqcd matrix elements , as in eq .",
    "( [ replace ] ) above .",
    "[ fig2 ]    as at nlo , we will concern ourselves here with infrared behavior at order @xmath3 , which may be computed by evaluating each diagram in eikonal approximation and then expanding their sum in @xmath73 , or by expanding the diagrams first , as in eq .",
    "( [ nlopt ] ) . noting that the two approaches give the same answer , we summarize the results here , and provide details of the calculations elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the presence of poles with this coefficient could indicate problems with factorization , that is , with matching the poles of the fragmentation function to those of the perturbative cross section .",
    "these could arise when the integration over @xmath48 is not rotationally invariant , as might happen for polarized final states , and/or final states with gluons of energies of order @xmath50 in the rest frame of @xmath6 , since their directions are arbitrary .",
    "we are unable at this stage to rule out the occurance of such terms at higher orders in the strong coupling , or in higher powers of @xmath3 .",
