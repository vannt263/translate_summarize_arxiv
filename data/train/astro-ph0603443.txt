    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars dominate the return of processed materials to the interstellar medium ( ism ) and therefore are an important component of galaxy evolution .",
    "high mass - loss rate objects are heavily obscured , so they can be missed in optical surveys and need to be observed in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "we have conducted a study using the _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ;",
    "@xcite ) of a sample of luminous 8  @xmath0 m sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "our sample was selected from a compilation of _",
    "2mass / msx _ sources @xcite , using near - infrared color and magnitude criteria to target high mass - loss , evolved objects .",
    "irs low - resolution spectra of 62 targets were obtained in cycle 1 .",
    "an atlas of the spectra has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the spectra reveal continuum and spectral features that allow the dominant chemistry of the dust circumstellar envelope to be determined .",
    "figure [ fig : egspec ] shows typical spectra of oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) , carbon - rich ( c - rich ) , and emission - line objects .",
    "we find that almost all the o - rich stars are red supergiants ( rsgs ) with infrared luminosities l@xmath1  l@xmath2 ( figure [ fig : lumhist ] ) .",
    "the lack of lower luminosity o - rich agb stars suggests that massive supergiants do not have long enough he - burning lifetimes to produce c - rich surfaces ( and hence c - rich ejecta ) , despite the low metallicity of the lmc .",
    "the c - rich stars are all agb stars with l@xmath3  l@xmath2 . the large number of c - rich agb stars stands in stark contrast to the lack of o - rich agb stars found .",
    "this result is consistent with the hypothesis that c - rich stars form more easily than o - rich ones due to the low metallicity environment of the lmc .",
    "we find that the emission - line objects are all hii regions with l@xmath4  l@xmath2 .",
    "these objects were all expected to be planetary nebulae ( pne ) based on _",
    "2mass / msx _ colors @xcite , but optical and ir images reveal diffuse nebulae around the objects , and the irs spectra show a jump in flux density between the short - low ( 5.2  14  @xmath0 m , slit width 3.6@xmath5 ) and long - low ( 14.0  38  @xmath0 m , slit width 10.5@xmath5 ) modules indicating the emission is extended on parsec scales .",
    "the spectra also show a lack of high - ionization narrow emission lines common in pne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "photometric tools such as color - color diagrams are invaluable for identifying and classifying stellar objects . however , photometric diagnostics must first be reliably associated with spectral properties using spectroscopy .",
    "we used our irs spectra to revise the _",
    "2mass / msx _ classification criteria of @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : nircols ] we present _",
    "2mass / msx _ color - color diagrams showing our improved photometric classification criteria .",
    "one of the primary goals of our _ spitzer _ program was to provide a spectroscopic basis for irac and mips photometric classifications of ir sources in external galaxies . to that end , we derived synthetic irac and mips magnitudes using the irs spectra and the imaging filter spectral response functions .",
    "figure [ fig : sstcols ] shows the resulting color - color diagrams and diagnostics for identifying spectroscopic classes .",
    "we have obtained low - resolution irs spectra of a sample of 60 luminous 8  @xmath0 m sources in the lmc and classified the sources according to their spectral properties .",
    "almost all of the agb stars in the sample are c - rich , while the o - rich objects are luminous rsgs .",
    "we use our spectroscopic classifications to develop revised infrared photometric diagnostics to classify luminous ir sources , thus correcting inaccuracies in current widely - used criteria .",
    "we propose new photometric diagnostics to identify ir sources in other galaxies , based on synthetic _ spitzer _ photometry and existing _",
    "2mass / msx _ photometry .",
    "a full discussion of the data analysis and additional results will appear in @xcite .",
    "thanks to the conference organizers for a great meeting .",
