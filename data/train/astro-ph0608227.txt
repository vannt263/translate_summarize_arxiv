    "understanding the role of dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster systems as building blocks of massive early - type and spiral galaxies is one of the great challenges of modern astrophysics . studying the chemical compositions and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) in the nearby low - mass galaxies",
