    "f - actin is a highly charged polyelectrolyte that plays a key role in the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells , where it forms a network of bundles made by crosslinking proteins @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that multivalent counterions can cause these macromolecules to attract each other ( the phenomenon known as like - charge attraction ) and form aggregates @xcite .",
    "when the separation between two polyelectrolytes like f - actin is considerably larger than their diameter , they can be modeled as uniformly charged lines , cylinders , or bead - spring chains , for the calculation of their electrostatic interaction potential @xcite . despite their simplicity ,",
    "such coarse - grained minimal models have been shown to suffice for obtaining the essence of the overall behavior of these polyelectrolytes in solution .",
    "analytical and computational studies using these models have shown that the interaction potential between two similarly charged stiff polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solution crucially depends on their separation , mutual orientation and the concentration and valence of the salt @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the collective behavior of stiff polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solution , such as the formation of aggregates of various structures and high sensitivity of these structures to the salt concentration and valence , are believed to originate from the complexity and high anisotropy of their interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the complexity is the result of the combination of the highly anisotropic shape of stiff polyelectrolytes and the simultaneous presence of short- and long - range interactions in the system , and is also known to lead to frustration and slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "the interaction between these macromolecules at close separations , however , can not be studied using such simplistic models . in this case , the detailed structure of the macromolecules such as their helical symmetry , charge distribution , thickness , dielectric constant , twist rigidity and so on , will need to be taken into consideration .",
    "it has been observed that like - charge attraction between helical polyelectrolytes such as f - actin and dna induced by multivalent salt could organize them in closely packed , hexagonally ordered bundles of parallel polyelectrolytes .",
    "native helical symmetry of these polyelectrolytes may be incommensurate with the mentioned hexagonal order@xcite . in this case",
    ", the interplay between twist rigidity of the polyelectrolytes and electrostatic correlations determines their equilibrium conformation in the bundle .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical studies on interaction between helical macromolecules in the literature @xcite .",
    "experimental study of bundle formation by f - actin in the presence of multivalent salt has shown that there are major differences between f - actin bundles formed in this way and those formed non - electrostatically @xcite . to study like - charge attraction between such polyelectrolytes in close separations",
    "the model should contain details of the charge distribution on the polyelectrolytes and their orientational and torsional degrees of freedom .",
    "coarse - grained models ( such as the bead - spring model ) are not suitable for such studies . on the other hand ,",
    "computer simulation of these macromolecules in atomistic scale is too time consuming , while a large number of the internal degrees of freedom will also be redundant and have no role in the interaction between the macromolecules .",
    "therefore , a sufficiently detailed coarse - grained model that incorporates the helical structure of the macromolecules seems to be the most appropriate starting point for such a study .    in this paper",
    ", we study the mechanism of like - charge attraction between coarse - grained model f - actins in the presence of multivalent counterions using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we find for two parallel f - actins that the maximum attraction occurs between monomers whose charged domains are in the closest separation .",
    "the attractive potential of mean force between f - actins reveals no detectable dependence on their helical symmetry .",
    "the like - charge attraction between f - actins organizes them in bundles of hexagonal lattice structure containing long - lived defects .",

    "section [ sec - conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we use a coarse - grained model for f - actin that takes into consideration a number of key macromolecular features such as its diameter ( that is relatively large , say as compared to the mobile ions ) , helical order of its charge distribution , persistent length , rotational and twist degrees of freedom , and its twist rigidity .",
    "we construct the model f - actin by assembling two kinds of spheres ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - actinmodel ] ) : a large neutral sphere that makes the backbone of f - actin ( that represents the volume of actin ) and a smaller negatively charged sphere that carry the net charge of f - actin ( which has a linear charge density @xmath2 ) .",
    "each g - actin monomer is thus modeled as a set of a large sphere and an attached small charged sphere .",
    "the adjacent large spheres are bonded to each other by a harmonic potential , @xmath3 , of spring constant @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the average separation between them and @xmath6 is the md length scale ( see below ) .",
    "three - particle angle potential , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 is used to mimic f - actin bending rigidity and keep our model f - actins as rod - like polymers ( since their lengths are considerably smaller than the persistence length of f - actin ) .",
    "the positions of the small spheres are determined from x - ray observation - based four - sphere model of g - actin @xcite .",
    "these spheres play the role of subdomain-1 ( sd1 ) , which is known to carry most of the g - actin charge . according to the four - sphere model , the position of the sd1 domain of the @xmath9th monomer in the regular conformation of f - actin ,",
    "can be given by @xmath10 in cylindrical coordinate system .",

    ", it can be calculated that each small sphere carries the charge of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the elementary charge ) .",
    "the charge of each small sphere is considered as a point charge in its center .",
    "we explicitly add 3-valent counterions of charge @xmath28 as lennard - jones ( lj ) particles of diameter @xmath29 ( md length scale in our simulations ) to neutralize the charge of f - actins .",
    "lennard - jones potential also introduces an energy scale , @xmath30 , to the system .",
    "we use 3-valent ( not 2-valent ) counterions to strengthen the electrostatic correlations in the system and probe the role of these correlations easily .",
    "one should note that because of the coarse - graining method in our model there is no essential difference between 2- and 3-valent counterions .    considering that in typical actin bundling experiments @xcite the salt concentration is 36 - 108 mm ,",
    "electrostatic interactions are strongly screened and act only at short ranges ( the screening length is @xmath31 ) . like - charge attraction between polyelectrolytes is known to originate from correlations and fluctuations of multivalent counterions in their vicinity . to account for the effect of salt and avoid the time consuming calculations of the long - ranged coulomb interactions ,",
    "we use a screened debye - hckel potential and explicitly add counterions to the system .",
    "the debye - hckel potential for the electrostatic interaction between the charged particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 is given as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the bjerrum length ( in water at room temperature ) , @xmath36(@xmath37 ) is the valence of charged particle @xmath32(@xmath33 ) and @xmath38 is the separation between charges @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the potential of mean force per monomer versus the separation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - potmeanforce ] .",
    "we calculate the potential of mean force for three different values of @xmath13 corresponding to helical symmetries @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath56 .",
    "our results show that the interaction potential as a function of the separation does not depend on f - actins helical symmetry and no detectable difference for above - mentioned symmetries is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - potmeanforce ] ) .",
    "we also observe that the difference between initial phases , @xmath12 , of the interacting f - actins tends to vanish in equilibrium .    to understand the mechanism of interaction between a pair of neighboring model f",
    "- actins it is instructive to look at the forces acting on each of their monomers .",
    "the average forces acting on monomers of two interacting f - actins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcealong ] , which shows that the mutual attraction is strongest between the few monomers in each helical period whose charged domains are closest to each other .",
    "interactions between the other monomers are found to be considerably smaller than that of the overlapping charged domains .",
    "the few overlapping domains produce a strong attractive potential for the counterions and gather them in the narrow space between these domains .",
    "to study the bundle formation of the filaments , we first fix @xmath40 parallel f - actins of length @xmath57 on a hexagonal lattice of spacing @xmath58 , larger than the value corresponding to the minimum of the potential of mean force ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - potmeanforce ] ) .",
    "we then leave the counterions to equilibrate , and subsequently release all the degrees of freedom of the f - actins , except that we constrain the two ends of the filament to move on the two boundary surfaces of the simulation box .",
    "we have also repeated the same procedure with non - hexagonal initial configurations of f - actins .",
    "we observe that regardless of the initial configuration of the f - actins they attract each other and form a bundle in which their axes form a hexagonal lattice .",
    "moreover , the initial phases of the helices ( variable @xmath12 in eq . [ eq_factin_helix ] ) are observed to approach each other in the course of the aggregation dynamics .    to visualize this behavior",
    "we represent the initial phase , @xmath12 , of each f - actin by a vector directed from f - actin axis to sd1 of its first monomer and probe the directional ordering of these vectors in the @xmath59 plane in our simulations .",
    "we perform these simulations for different system sizes , @xmath60 . in the case of @xmath54 ,",
    "the system easily finds its low - energy state in which parallel f - actins are ordered hexagonally and their phase vectors are mostly aligned in the same direction . for large @xmath40 , however , usually there are some defects in the hexagonal order of f - actins in the bundle , with their number increasing when the number of f - actins in    the system increases .",
    "these defects are very long - lived and for the systems larger than @xmath61 it is not possible to observe their disappearance and to find defect - less hexagonal order in the system in our simulations .",
    "moreover , defects in the long - range directional order of the phase vectors ( similar to those found in 2d xy model ) are also observed in the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - xysourcesink ] ) .",
    "the positional and the orientational defects are strongly correlated .",
    "namely , when there are positional defects in the system , certainly orientational defects are also present .",
    "orientational defects are also observed in systems without any positional defects .",
    "low - energy state of the system corresponds to a configuration in which f - actins form a hexagonally ordered bundle with no defect and with their phase vectors all aligned in the same direction .",
    "we define an order parameter , @xmath62 , as @xmath63 in which the summation runs over nearest neighbor pairs to probe directional ordering of the phase vectors .",
    "a typical behavior of the order parameter , @xmath64 , as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - orderpar ] .",
    "the figure shows that the order parameter starts from the initial value of zero corresponding to complete lack of order in the phase vectors orientation , and saturates to a value that represents the degree of alignment between the phase vectors .",
    "simulations of f - actins with the value of @xmath13 set to the native @xmath0 symmetry show no appreciable change in the f - actins helical symmetry upon bundle formation .",
    "although local deviations of dihedral angles between adjacent monomers along f - actins are observed , the average value of the dihedral angles agrees well with the native value .",
    "we performed these simulations with two other helical symmetries of the model f - actins , namely @xmath56 and @xmath1 , and observed no noticeable changes in the results .",
    "statistics and averages of deviations of dihedral angles between adjacent monomers from their native values for three different helical symmetries are the same within the error bars .",
    "we also performed simulations with model f - actins with native helical symmetry of @xmath0 but using initial conformations ( after equilibration of the counterions ) that had symmetries of @xmath56 and @xmath1 ( two separate simulations ) .",
    "we found that in both cases , after releasing the f - actins degrees of freedom their symmetry returned back ( in a short time ) to the native @xmath0 .",
    "these observations suggest that electrostatic correlations are not capable of keeping changing the helical symmetry of f - actins in bundle .    to study the counterion distribution and the force field acting on g - actin monomers in a bundle of hexagonally ordered parallel f - actins , we construct a bundle of @xmath40 fixed f - actins with their axes on a hexagonal lattice and leave the counterions to equilibrate .",
    "we choose the lattice constant as the value that corresponds to the minimum of the potential of mean force shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - potmeanforce ] .",
    "we then release the twist and rotational degrees of freedom of f - actins and allow them to equilibrate .",
    "after equilibration of the system we probe the counterion distribution and the forces acting on the monomers of f - actins and any deviation of the twist order of f - actins from its native symmetry . a typical counterion density profile chosen from a part of the system containing @xmath65 model f - actins",

    "[ fig - xydistcount ] , in which the distribution profile is obtained using the superposition of @xmath66 snapshots of the system chosen from @xmath67 integration time steps of the simulation .",
    "we also calculate counterion - counterion pair correlation function in @xmath16 direction .",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - pair_correlation ] ) .",
    "this result combined with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - xydistcount ] shows that the counterions are mostly distributed in the narrowest gap between two neighboring f - actins inside the bundle as domains of separation equal to monomer - monomer separation along the f - actins .",
    "the centers of the channels formed by three adjacent f - actins correspond to a lower density of the counterions despite the picture of charge density wave presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "time - average forces acting on the actin monomers in a bundle of @xmath54 model f - actins for two values of @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetries are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcefield ] .",
    "the main difference between helical symmetries @xmath0 and @xmath1 is related to their commensurability with the hexagonal lattice . despite the native @xmath0 symmetry of f - actin , symmetries like @xmath1 and @xmath56 are commensurate with hexagonal lattice ( considering its definition , symmetry @xmath18 is commensurate with hexagonal lattice if @xmath45 is divisible by @xmath68 ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig - forcefield ] shows , the strengths and directions of the forces that act on actin monomers are slightly more regular in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "apart from that , we observed no detectable difference between the time - average forces acting on the f - actins for the three different symmetries .",
    "we note that we have found some evidence suggesting that the number ( or density ) of positional defects for the same value of @xmath40 is higher for the native symmetry of @xmath0 as compared to those that are commensurate with the hexagonal order of f - actins .",
    "although this observation seems plausible , it needs to be probed more systematically using larger systems .",
    "here we consider a bundle of hexagonally ordered parallel f - actins with the neutralizing charge of the counterions distributed as equally charged domains inside the bundle .",
    "the charge domains form one dimensional lattices of spacing @xmath69 along f - actins and are regularly distributed inside the bundle .",
    "considering symmetries of the system , two different arrangements of the columns of charged regions are possible .",

    "the amount of the charge of these domains , which are considered as point charges in centers of gray spheres ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - simcodemodel ] ) , are determined in a way that the total charge of the system is zero . for both of these arrangements we calculate total energy of the system composed of electrostatic interactions ( debye - hckel potential with @xmath70 ) and twist energy of f - actins , for different values of regular deviation of f - actins helical",

    "[ fig - simcodeenergy ] , energy of the system versus the value of the deviation from the native symmetry for the separation between neighboring f - actins , @xmath71 , is shown .",
    "as it can be seen , there are some local minima in the energy of the system corresponding to symmetries of f - actin which are commensurate with hexagonal lattice .",
    "the global minimum corresponds to @xmath1 symmetry of arrangement ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - simcodemodel ] . also , as it can be seen in this figure , energy of the system is considerably lower and local minima are considerably deeper in the case of arrangement ( b ) relative to arrangement ( a ) .",
    "a similar study for arrangement of multivalent counterions inside a bundle of polyelectrolytes modeled as uniformly charged lines has been performed @xcite . despite the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , helical order of f - actin charge distribution enters the subject of commensurability into the problem in our model .",
    "we also looked at the effect of the slide of the neighboring one - dimensional lattices of charge domains with respect to one another and found that such slides increase the system energy and the low energy state of the system corresponds to the configuration with no slide of these columns relative to one another .",
    "considering these results in addition to the counterion distribution obtained from the bulk simulations at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig - xydistcount ] ) , it seems that the counterions have a high tendency to the narrowest gap between two f - actins in the bundle and the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - xydistcount ] is the dominant scenario relative to the other picture in which counterions are mostly distributed inside the channels formed by three adjacent f - actins .",
    "in conclusion , using a coarse - grained model and md simulations , the mechanism of like - charge attraction between f - actins and bundle formation in the presence of multivalent counterions have been studied .",
    "important macromolecular features of f - actin such as its diameter size , persistence length , helically ordered charge distribution , and twist rigidity have been considered in our model .",
    "it has been shown that parallel f - actins attract each other in the presence of 3-valent counterions and the maximum attraction occurs between monomers that their charged domains are in the closest separation . due to the like - charge attraction , f - actins aggregate and form closely packed bundles of parallel f - actins .",
    "it has been found that the phase difference between helical structure of neighboring f - actins in a bundle tends to vanish .",
    "defects in the long - range orientational order of the phase vectors with interesting similarities to those of 2d xy model have also been observed .",
    "in addition , long - lived positional defects in the hexagonal order of f - actins in the bundles have been observed that their number increases with increasing the bundle size .",
    "existence of similar defects have also been reported in experimental studies of similar systems @xcite .",
    "counterions inside the bundles have been observed that are mostly distributed in the narrowest gap between neighboring f - actins and the channels formed by three adjacent f - actins in the bundles contain lower density of the counterions .",
    "the density of counterions in the narrowest gap between neighboring f - actins in the bundles varies periodically along f - actins with a wave length approximately equal to the separation between consecutive g - actin monomers along the actin polymer .",
    "our results obtained from simulations presented in sec . [ sec - bundlemechanism ] show that in the bundle formation process , deviation of dihedral angle between consecutive monomers along f - actins from its native value happens .",
    "it seems that by these local deviations the system decreases the incommensurability effects of f - actins native structure with the hexagonal order . such local deviations from a regular symmetry in f - actin helical structure has also been reported in experimental studies @xcite .",
    "changing of f - actin helical symmetry from @xmath0 to other symmetries has not been observed in our simulations .",
    "positional defects of life time longer than our simulation times have been observed in the hexagonal order of f - actins in the bundles .",
    "the number of these defects has been found that increases with increasing the bundle size . also , it has been observed that no considerable coarsening of these defects happens in our simulations because of very slow dynamics of their evolution inside the bundle .",
    "although additional studies of these defects in larger systems are needed , existence of such defects could be a reason for finite sided bundles of f - actin in multivalent salt solution .",
    "study of a bundle of hexagonally ordered parallel f - actins with the charge of counterions distributed as columns of charge domains inside the bundle similar to the cdw picture of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the configuration of minimum energy corresponds to @xmath1 helical symmetry of f - actins with columns of charged regions in the middle of the separation between axes of neighboring f - actins . in this arrangement , sd1s of f - actins and the charge domains of opposite sign are closer to each other in comparison with the other possible arrangement in which the columns of charged domains are located on the axes of the channels formed by three adjacent f - actins .",
    "this calculation shows that if we arrange the counterions according to the scenario of the charge density wave presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimum energy of the system in our model corresponds to @xmath1 symmetry , not @xmath56 .",
    "considering f - actin torsional modulus , overtwisting it from its native helical symmetry to for example @xmath56 symmetry ( @xmath72 over - twist per monomer ) costs an energy of @xmath73 per monomer .",

    "energy cost of such a deviation ( undertwist ) is in the range of thermal fluctuations strength and under - twisting of f - actin to this symmetry seems to be possible . in our simulations",
    "however , we found that the system prefers the f - actins to have local deviations from their native symmetries instead of regularly changing of the helical symmetry",
