    "throughout the universe we observe powerful engines which accelerate particles to immense energies .",
    "the precise details of how these engines function are still poorly understood , but polarization measurements of the high energy radiation are pivotal to gain a deeper insight into the physical environment in these systems .",
    "+ highly ordered geometries are generally required to produce a net polarization signal in the emission from a source , and strong magnetic fields are usually thought to play a leading role in the emission processes .",
    "the strength and direction of a polarization signal will lead back to an understanding of the physical mechanisms and their geometry at the emission site .",
    "there have been few attempts at measuring hard x - ray polarization since measurements are hampered by large backgrounds and systematic effects within the detectors .",
    "however , the advent of modern fast computing clusters has made large scale simulation of an instrument s response now possible . by combining instrument data and results from detailed monte - carlo mass - model simulations using geant4",
    ", it is possible to put constraints on the polarization characteristics of the hard x - ray flux emitted by a source . using the compton scattered events in the spi instrument on _ integral _ ( 130 - 8000 kev ) ,",
    "constraints have been already put on the percentage polarization in the prompt gamma - ray flux of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; ) and the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "the latter showing a remarkable alignment to the rotational axis of the spinning neutron star .",
    "+ however , improvements on the methods and techniques employed in the search for polarization could be achieved .",
    "this paper discusses new developments that have been made in the mass - model and in the analysis procedure for the spi instrument .",
    "the signature of polarization in the source signal can be found through the interaction process of photons within detectors . + in the hard x - ray regime ,",
    "the dominant process is compton scattering . in the case of a linearly polarized flux ,",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath2 of the scattered photon is no longer isotropic .",
    "the probability for the photon to be scattered at a polar angle @xmath3 and an azimuthal angle @xmath2 is given by the klein - nishina differential cross - section @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the classical electron radius , @xmath6 is the ratio between the scattered and incident photon energies , and @xmath2 is the azimuthal scatter angle defined as the angle to the polarization unit vector .",
    "an azimuthal anisotropy is observed in the scattering direction , producing a greater number of scatters in a direction perpendicular to the emission polarization angle ( p.a .",
    "; see figure [ kn_plot ] ) .",
    "this formula shows that as the energy increases the angular distribution related to the polarization becomes more isotropic .",
    "+ using a suitable arrangement of detector elements , this anisotropy can be used to determine the direction and degree of polarization of any observed emission .",
    "spi is a coded - aperture telescope on board the _ integral _ observatory operating between 20 kev and 8 mev .",
    "the description of the instrument and its performances can be found in and .",
    "spi consists of 19 hexagonal germanium detectors measuring 5.6 cm flat - to - flat and 7 cm deep , tessellated into a hexagonal shape ( see figure [ ge ] ) .",
    "the center - to - center distance between detectors is 6 cm . originally designed for fine spectroscopy",
    ", spi can be used as a compton polarimeter .",
    "the measurement of polarization using compton events relies on the positions of the initial and final photon interaction in the detectors . in spi ,",
    "there is no positional information available inside a detector so only the multiple events where the photon deposits its energy in more than one detector can be used .",
    "this kind of event is identified by energy deposits occurring within a coincidence window of 350 ns and not detected by the anti - coincidence system .",
    "the effective area of spi for multiple events is reported in and range from 10 @xmath7 to 50 @xmath7 between 150 kev and 1 mev . since _ _",
    "integral__s launch , four detectors have failed : detector 2 ( 2003 ) , detector 17 ( 2004 ) , detector 5 ( 2009 ) , and detector 1 ( 2010 ) .",
    "these failures have resulted in a decrease of the effective area of the instrument down to @xmath8 of the original area for multiple events .",
    "+ besides its effective area , the quality of a polarimeter depends on the sampling of the compton scattered events distribution ( figure [ kn_plot ] ) by the detectors .",
    "an usual figure of merit for polarimeters is the @xmath9-factor , defined as the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular components of the scattered distribution .",
    "the @xmath9-factor , which is energy dependent , has been calculated for spi to be @xmath10 over the energy range of 0.1 - 1 mev @xcite .",
    "+ when searching for polarization in a source emission , any scattered distribution on the detector plane will be modulated by the coded mask shadow and the dead detectors .",
    "these effects can be mistaken for a polarization signal if they are not properly accounted for . instead of looking for an anisotropy in the scattered distribution ,",
    "a much simpler method is to simulate the detector response for a polarized flux and compare it to the measured data . in this way ,",
    "polarization analysis with spi is perform in the same way than imaging but using the instrument response with one additional dimension : the p.a .",
    "thus , for each spi observation we need simulations for different p.a.s in the source emission .",
    "the presented simulations are based on a model recoded from the geant3 timm ( for the integral mass model ; ) into the geant4 framework .",
    "geant4 @xcite uses object orientated c++ language and includes extra physics such as polarization and material activation . the geant4 software package has been tested against calibration data from a prototype detector array @xcite and reliably reproducing the instrument response to a polarized beam . in the new model of _",
    "integral _ , the spi and jem - x detectors have been both fully modeled .",
    "however , at the current time , the ibis detector is only described with an approximate geometry ( figure [ g4model ] ) .",
    "this is not a problem for our polarimetry studies , since the work revolves around the spi instrument .",
    "masses situated away from the spi instrument will have little or no impact on the results .",
    "conversely , the spi instrument has been modeled with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "it comprises the active veto , the ge detector elements inside al capsules , surrounded by the be housing , and the mask assembly .",
    "the geant4 incarnation of the _ integral _ model was specifically written to assess the background in the spi instrument .",
    "this means that several components of the geometry and particle generation processes have not been considered but could become important when looking at the emission from an astronomical object .",
    "for example , the exact geometry of the coded mask and the ability to generate photons with a given spectral shape had to be implemented .",
    "+ a great deal of effort has been spent on updating the simulation to produce a much more accurate model of the spi instrument , including several missing components in the geometry . in the current status ,",
    "our simulations take into account the effects of non - functioning ( dead ) detectors , off - axis illumination and mask shadowing .",
    "compared to the model version used by @xcite , we have included the degraded transparency of the central mask pixel which is 66% at 130 kev and 80% at 600 kev .",
    "we have also modified the anti - coincidence system .",
    "in fact , the most important part surrounding the detectors was not active in the code and we introduced the anti - coincidence thresholds ( @xmath11100 kev ) .",
    "these modifications have an important impact on the number of events in the outer detectors and drastically change the instrument response .",
    "the individual germanium crystal dimensions have been slightly reconsidered ( resulting in a few @xmath12 smaller volumes ) modifying the instrument sensitivity . in particular ,",
    "the misalignment of the spi telescope axis relatively to the _ integral _ satellite pointing axis has been corrected , which corresponds to a systematic of @xmath13 in the pointing accuracy .",
    "this correction is essential for the simulation of the instrument response because it modifies the mask shadowing and thus , the event distribution over the detectors ( @xmath14 of the events ) .",
    "these important changes in the instrument simulation lead to a good agreement with the spi standard response ( see section [ validation ] ) .",
    "+ the polarimetry capability of the spi instrument is based on the compton efficiency of the detector plane , i.e. , the non - diagonal terms of the response matrix ( @xmath15 of the total efficiency ) . this geant4 model",
    "allow us to carefully evaluate them , through their dependence on the p.a .",
    "of the incident radiation .",
    "it provides a robust technique , using the whole instrument response and thus giving the best sensitivity to the polarization characteristics .",
    "the simulated source is characterized by its direction in equatorial coordinates ( r.a .",
    ", decl . ) , an energy spectrum , and a p.a .",
    "this angle corresponds to the position angle of the electric vector measured from north to east on the sky . for each pointing ,",
    "simulations are carried out at 18 p.a.s ( 0@xmath1 - 170@xmath1 in @xmath16 steps ) and 1 unpolarized .",
    "only the p.a.s between @xmath17 and @xmath18 need be modeled due to the @xmath19 symmetry of the compton scattering process .",
    "+ to properly simulate the photons distribution , the data is pre - analyzed and fitted with a simple spectral shape .",
    "this is performed with the classical spi spectral analysis using the xspec software @xcite .",
    "the spectral models form the basis of a probability distribution for the fired photons so that a single photon may be simulated at any energy , but after millions of photons , the spectrum should resemble that of the observed data . in theory , it should be possible to simulate a flat input spectrum with a fixed number of photons in each energy bin and to normalize a posteriori the number of photons in each energy bin .",
    "simulations would need to be carried out only once and spectral changes could be handled in the analysis .",
    "however , this will needlessly simulate many photons at high energies and would drastically lengthen the running time of the simulations .",
    "+ besides , a small difference in the input spectrum will not lead to a big effect in the simulation .",
    "we have compared two simulations , with a power law slope of -3.0 and -1.5 , respectively .",
    "this results in differences less than @xmath20 in the count rate distribution recorded in the detectors .",
    "+ for each simulation , millions of photons are fired from the direction of the source .",
    "their initial positions are randomly distributed on a @xmath21 cm surface , 500 cm away from the detector plane , so as to illuminate all the instrument .",
    "this area has been chosen large enough to include the direct lighting from the source and the scattered events from the structure in the detected events . for a typical power law spectrum with a slope of -2.2 ,",
    "50 million of photons are processed for each simulation resulting in @xmath22 single events and @xmath23 multiple events in the detector . for a source flux of 1 crab",
    "observed during one pointing ( @xmath112 ks ) , this provides an oversampling of approximately 40 times .",
    "+ for one photon fired ( event ) , all the energy deposits inside the detectors are stored if no deposit occurred in the anti - coincidence system .",
    "+ the number of simulations needed makes this part of the analysis very time consuming .",
    "one simulation takes @xmath24 hr to run on a single processor . to produce data corresponding to 200 spi exposures ( @xmath11400 ks ) , we need to run 3800 simulations ( @xmath25 )",
    "using 32 10-core processors , the computing time is reduced from 950 to 3 days .",
    "the original data produced by geant4 is a list of energy deposits within sensitive volumes .",
    "these raw data require some selection and preparation before analysis . a low energy threshold of 20 kev is applied and the events occurring in dead detectors are removed .",
    "these reductions affect the multiple events : some triple events will become doubles and some doubles will become singles . for the data analysis , we select the double events with energy deposits occurring in adjacent detectors .",
    "there are 42 corresponding pseudo detectors for all the possible couples of adjacent detectors",
    ". then the simulated data are energy binned and recorded in the same format as the spi data to simplify the analysis procedure .",
    "+ for a single pointing , simulations are carried out for 18 p.a.s ( 100@xmath12 polarized ) and 1 unpolarized . however , the analysis requires simulated data for different polarization percentages for each angle .",
    "these data are produced by mixing the polarized simulated distributions with the unpolarized one using the formula @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the ( geant4 ) simulated data for a @xmath28 percent polarized flux at the angle @xmath2 , @xmath29 the @xmath30 polarized simulated data at angle @xmath2 , and @xmath31 the unpolarized simulated data .",
    "the search for polarization in a source emission requires accurate simulations of the instrument response , any differences would lead to a spurious polarization signal .",
    "figure [ 661 ] shows the spectral response of the geant4 simulation compared to the spi standard response matrix , for a mono - energetic source at 661 kev .",
    "the single events are summed over all the detectors and the counts per 1 kev bin are plotted in fraction of the photo - peak . with the implemented mass model improvements , the two curves differ by only @xmath32 in counts per bin with compton to total counts ratio of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the geant4 simulation and the spi response matrix , respectively .",
    "this ratio is important as it drives the production of multiples events .",
    "if the simulated detector geometry is too large or too heavy , this ratio would be smaller , i.e. , less multiple events and more single events will be produced .",
    "figure [ pseudodetcounts ] shows the spatial distribution produced by the geant4 code compared to the measured spi response , for the same configuration .",
    "compared to the spi response , the unpolarized theoretical curve ( blue ) differs by only @xmath14 in counts per pseudo - detector whereas the @xmath35 polarized one ( red ) differs by @xmath15 .",
    "it means that the signature of a polarized signal is contained in the difference , i.e. , @xmath36 of the recorded counts . the spatial distribution is highly modulated by the mask pattern and the telescope pointing accuracy .",
    "less obvious , the anti - coincidence system and especially its energy threshold has an important impact on the spatial distribution .",
    "a too high threshold will miss multiple events , increasing the recorded double events in the outer pseudo - detectors .",
    "in a single spi observation , the recorded flux is barely enough to produce an image or a spectrum of the source .",
    "this means that for a more complicated analysis such as polarization measurement , many observations need to be summed together .",
    "unfortunately , the instrument configuration changes along the time : the pointing axis is shifted by @xmath37 , every 30 - 40 minutes , while , on a longer timescale , detector failure must be accounted for together with other parameter ( i.e. , background ) evolution . for a given source ,",
    "our study relies on simultaneous analysis of a great number of pointings .",
    "considering one exposure , the recorded data are modeled as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the source normalization , @xmath40 , the simulated count distribution , @xmath41 is the background normalization and @xmath42,the background spatial distribution .",
    "the source model @xmath43 describes the number of counts for a science window @xmath44 , in the pseudo detector @xmath45 as a function of source polarization fraction , @xmath28 , and angle , @xmath2 .",
    "the background spatial distribution is taken from an empty field observation temporally close to the observation . to be comparable with the data , the counts issued from the simulation are renormalized to the corresponding detector livetimes .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath41 values are determined through a linear least squares resolution and the resulting @xmath0 value is stored . if the source and background flux can be considered constant on a long time scale , equation ( [ source_equ ] ) is solved for the corresponding set of science windows .",
    "+ note that it is different from previous polarization studies made with the spi instrument , where the source and the background were not adjusted by a fitting procedure . for grbs ,",
    "the background was estimated using appropriate time intervals before and after the source signal .",
    "this is not feasible with most of the sources .",
    "for the crab , @xcite considered a background with a constant pattern and its norm was calculated by subtracting the simulated counts from the data .",
    "this is hazardous because it implies the perfect knowledge of the instrument sensitivity and the source strength during each science window . in our code , the background pattern is built every six months from relevant empty field observations and its normalization is allowed to vary on a timescale from one science window to a revolution . estimating the source and the background fluxes in the analysis procedure introduces additional degrees of freedom ( dof ) but provides a better determination of the source contribution and allows polarization measurements for any ( strong enough ) source .",
    "the analysis process relies on the comparison between the recorded data and the theoretical ones .",
    "it can be described by the following procedure .    *",
    "science windows with the source closer than @xmath46 from the pointing direction are selected .",
    "this ensures a good illumination of the detectors .",
    "* a quick standard analysis is run to filter the science window list from obvious data anomalies . *",
    "the spi data are read into memory and the counts are summed over the selected energy range . *",
    "the corresponding simulated data are read into memory , the counts are summed over the selected energy range and weighted by the appropriate detector livetimes . * if the source and the background fluxes can be considered as constant , the science windows are grouped per data sets ( with a common @xmath39 and @xmath41 parameters ) . * looping over the entire range of p.a.s @xmath2 ( 0@xmath1 - 170@xmath1 ) and polarization fractions ( p.f.s ) @xmath28 ( @xmath47 to @xmath30 ) , equation ( [ source_equ ] ) is solved simultaneously for each data set through a linear least - squares resolution . *",

    "<S> the anisotropy characteristics of compton diffusions can provide information on the polarization parameters of the incident flux . by including the physics of the polarized compton process in the instrument simulation , we are able to determine the instrument response for a linearly polarized emission at any position angle . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed data with the simulation sets by a minimum @xmath0 technique to determine the polarization parameters of the source ( angle and fraction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested our analysis procedure with crab nebula observations and find a position angle similar to those previously reported in the literature , with a comfortable significance . since the instrument response depends on the incident angle , each exposure in the spi data requires its own set of simulations , calculated for 18 polarization angles ( from 0@xmath1 to 170@xmath1 in steps of 10@xmath1 ) and unpolarized emission . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of a large amount of observations for a given source , required to obtain statistically significant results , represents a large amount of computing time , but it is the only way to access this complementary information in the hard x - ray regime . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , major scientific advances are expected from such studies since the observational results will help to discriminate between the different models proposed for the high energy emission of compact objects like x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei or gamma - ray bursts . </S>"
