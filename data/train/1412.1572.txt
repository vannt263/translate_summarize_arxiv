    "the edge states are non - bonding and are located on only one of the two sublattices .",
    "it has been shown that the edge states are crucial in determining the magnetic and transport properties of nanostructured graphene systems  @xcite .    in conventional graphene qpcs , the edge states have negligible effects because they are far from the qpc .",
    "however , we show that electrons can be localized in qpcs as depicted in fig .",

    "these qbss can live up to @xmath1 for sufficiently large samples and their wave functions spread over only a few lattice constants .",
    "their lifetimes can be tuned by changing the geometry of the qpc and the size of the sample , whereas their energies @xmath2 are found to be insensitive to sample dimensions .",

    "( class iii ) our main interest lies in this third class .",
    "the interface edges @xmath9 and @xmath12 can be either ac or zz , while the edges @xmath10 and @xmath3 ( and hence @xmath11 and @xmath13 ) are zz .",

    ", the background contribution leads to an asymmetric lineshape for @xmath24 , i.e. , fano resonances .",
    "in this section , we analyze the electronic properties of graphene qpcs using transition matrix ( @xmath30-matrix ) formalism based on the nearest - neighbor tight - binding model  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the geometry shown in fig .",

    "explicitly , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the kronecker s function .",
    "we introduce the bare green s function , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 . for later use",
    ", we resolve the diagonal elements of @xmath50 as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the eigenstates of @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "now the @xmath30-matrix can be defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denots an infinitesimal positive number . in principle",
    ", this matrix captures all physical effects arising from scattering at the qpc .",
    "the qbs can be found by searching for the poles of @xmath57 .    for further analysis ,",
    "let us closely inspect the bonding character at the interface .",
    "we note that the @xmath31 connecting bonds fall into two categories : strongly connecting bonds ( scbs ) and weakly connecting bonds ( wcbs ) . introducing the bare local density of states ( ldos ) on atomic site @xmath58 at energy @xmath59 as @xmath60 $ ] , a scb",
    "is then defined to have nonvanishing @xmath61 on both @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath35 and @xmath64 denote the sites belonging to this bond .",
    "similarly , a wcb is defined to lack this property . in the qpc shown in fig .",

    "here we use two approximations .",
    "first , we neglect all inter - bond transitions ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is reasonable , because these transitions are higher - order processes in @xmath50 compared with intra - bond transitions .",
    "second , we assume @xmath66 at low energies if @xmath58 belongs to a wcb , which can be justified in the limit @xmath67 . then , we can easily derive that @xmath68 for wcbs and that @xmath69 for scbs  @xcite .",
    "basically , this expression describes the physical processes in which an electron travels back and forth between the sites @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in analogy with back - and - forth bounces experienced by an electron sandwiched between two potential barriers  @xcite .",
    "note that such processes increase returning probability and are responsible for the formation of qbss .",
    "the energy and broadening of qbs can be determined by seeking the poles of eq .",
    "( [ tf ] ) . rewriting @xmath70 ,",
    "the poles @xmath71 can be obtained via @xmath72 as will be shown later , in the large @xmath6 limit , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74l or r. @xmath75 and @xmath76 are real values , which vary from bond to bond .",
    "later , we will see that @xmath76 decreases to zero with increasing @xmath6 following a power law whereas @xmath75 approaches a constant @xmath77 . upon substitution",
    ", we immediately find @xmath78 from this it follows that , ( 1 ) there is a pair of qbs with each scb , whose energies are symmetric about zero ; ( 2 ) the energy of the qbs is not sensitive to the sample width , i.e. , @xmath79 ; ( 3 ) the qbs has a broadening , @xmath80 , which shrinks rapidly with @xmath6 , as explained below .",

    ", we consider the rectangular - corner qpc with @xmath218 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : f4 ] ) . in the absence of bearded sites ,",
    "the connecting bond would be a wcb .",
    "however , bearded sites transform an edge state initially located on the a- ( b- ) sublattice to edge state located on the b- ( a- ) sublattice  @xcite , and thus turn a wcb into a scb .",
    "then , one can show that @xmath219 and then the level broadening vanishes , implying a pair of genuine bound states on this bond .",
    "actually , bearded graphene is an insulator@xcite with a real band gap separating the edge states from the extended states .",
    "thus , the @xmath144 vanishes at the qbs energy , which is consistent with vanishing @xmath76 .",
    "the values of @xmath75 in the limit @xmath220 are expected to be similar to those of the scb @xmath168 in the same limit without bearded sites , because the wave functions in both cases are the same [ eq .  ( 17 ) ] .     without bearded sites.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "an essential element in the qbs theory presented above relates to the existence of non - bonding edge states at zero energy .",
    "generically , such states are originated from the breaking of pseudo time - reversal symmetry , which is unique to the graphene lattice .",
    "note that a perfect zigzag edge is not necessary for them to appear .",
    "indeed , they could show up in graphene edges of almost any shape except for the perfect armchair one ( in which case the symmetry is respected ) , even in the presence of a moderate external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the observation makes our theory more widely applicable .",
    "because the qbs extends over only a few lattice constants , the coulomb repulsion might be relatively strong .",
    "assuming an on - site repulsion of @xmath221  @xcite , the repulsion between two electrons in qbs can be as large as @xmath222 , much bigger than that in conventional semiconductor quantum dots ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "these interactions serve to manipulate spins for possible applications in spintronics and qubits . for sufficiently wide samples , the qbs lifetime can be very long . as a result , charges may accumulate in the qpc and may give rise to dynamical coulomb blockade effects  @xcite .",
    "the qbs may be visualized using stm , which probes the dressed local density of states ( ldos ) directly  @xcite .",
    "one can show that in comparison with the bare ldos , the dressed ldos is enhanced by an amount @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a function that decays as the stm tip moves away from a scb by @xmath226 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figure : f2v](c ) .",
    "the properties of the qbs can thus be directly determined .",
    "the qbs can also have optical signatures . specifically",
    ", we predict the optical absorption to be enhanced at the frequency @xmath227 , which corresponds to the energy required to excite an electron from the lower qbs at @xmath228 to the upper one at @xmath165 . for @xmath229 , this gives @xmath230 in the infrared regime .",
    "note that the qbs lifetime in this case is @xmath231 , which can be much longer than the optical oscillation period @xmath232 .",
    "thus , the system may be treated as an artificial two - level atom when dealing with its interaction with light at frequencies near or above @xmath233 .",
    "in addition , the qpcs can serve as the channel for a text - book single - level ( and single - electron in the presence of coulomb interactions ) resonant tunneling transistor . due to small level",
    "broadening , sharp turn - on can be expected at low temperatures .",
    "in conclusion , we elucidated a mechanism for the formation of atomic bound states in a type of graphene qpcs .",
    "these states arise because of the zero energy edge states that are associated with the breaking of pseudo time - reversal symmetry .",
    "their energies have been shown to be roughly independent of the sample dimensions .",
    "finite level broadening exists , which shrinks to zero following a power law as the sample width increases .",
    "because of the broadening , the states show up as breit - wigner resonances in the conductance of the qpcs .",
    "such resonances dominate the electronic transport properties in the low energy regime .",
