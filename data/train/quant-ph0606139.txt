    "the above definition of @xmath36 is in terms of the _ overcomplete _ spanning set @xmath38 , and so does little to elucidate the states that it encompasses .",
    "we shall provide a brief alternative definition in terms of a basis which is closely linked to the multinomial basis for the symmetric subspace .    the space @xmath39 is defined to be the span of states @xmath40 , given by@xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "it is possible to show that @xcite , and so the states @xmath43 provide an orthonormal _ countable _ basis of the coherent power subspace .",
    "they are analogous to the classical urn model of @xmath44 tosses of a fair @xmath3-sided coin .",
    "this second characterization allows us to gain an insight into the relative size of @xmath45 and the full symmetric subspace , @xmath46 . to do so ,",

    "the dimension of the @xmath44-weighted subspaces grows polynomially with @xmath44 , but in contrast @xmath45 contains only the state @xmath40 with weight @xmath44 .",

    "this allows the use of standard inequalities to bound @xmath56 from above .",
    "the displacement operator , defined below , plays the rle of the unitary transformations from @xcite .",
    "the crucial fact is that in our integral @xmath57 , analogous to that used in @xcite , we have no divergent dimension - dependent factor , which would be the case for a direct application of the existing proof . without this",

    "the counterexample given in @xcite shows that we shall never have a direct generalisation of the classical scenario .",
    "an important question concerns the characterization of the set of finitely exchangeable states for which approximate de finetti representations do exist .",
    "our work provides a partial answer to this question for a class of states to which the previously known de finetti theorems do not apply .",
    "it is possible to extend our results to a larger class of states by considering the countably infinite hilbert space @xmath26 as a tensor product of two , or possibly more , subsystems .",
    "for example , @xmath26 is equivalent to a tensor product of itself and a qubit , providing both a new family of de finetti states and a new bound on @xmath56 .",
    "this is the subject of ongoing work ."
