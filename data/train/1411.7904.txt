    "<S> the charge transport properties of hybrid halide perovskites are investigated with a combination of density functional theory including van der waals interaction and the boltzmann theory for diffusive transport in the relaxation time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find the mobility of electrons to be in the range 5 - 10  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 and that for holes within 1 - 5  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 , where the variations depend on the crystal structure investigated and the level of doping . </S>",
    "<S> such results , in good agreement with recent experiments , set the relaxation time to about 1  ps , which is the time - scale for the molecular rotation at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for the room temperature tetragonal phase we explore two possible orientations of the organic cations and find that the mobility has a significant asymmetry depending on the direction of the current with respect to the molecular axis . this is due mostly to the way the pbi@xmath2 octahedral symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly we find that substituting i with cl has minor effects on the mobilities . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the carrier mobility is probably not a key factor in determining the high solar - harvesting efficiency of this class of materials .    </S>",
    "<S> hybrid halide perovskites have made a breakthrough in the field of organic solar cells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their unique energy - harvesting efficiency , combined with the low manufacturing costs position them as an ideal materials class to focus research . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion of sunlight into electrical power has recently surpassed the outstanding efficiency of 15% for both mesoporous metal - oxide scaffolds and in planar heterojunction architectures  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the latest studies report a value exceeding 18%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a unique property of these materials is the ability to both act as light - harvesting medium and as charge carrier transporter . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite the intense research carried out in the past two years , some questions remain open regarding the nature of the material s working principles . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is still under debate whether the photo - generated charges have an excitonic or a free - carrier character , with results pointing towards contrasting conclusions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the origin of the high efficiencies of perovskite - based solar cell devices still needs to be unraveled , and it is not completely clear how the mobility of the active layer influences the overall performance .    </S>",
    "<S> savenije et al.@xcite have recently performed microwave photo - conductance and photo - luminescence experiments , measuring a mobility of 6.2  @xmath3/vs at 300  k. they found a band - like dependence of the mobility with temperature with a slope of @xmath4 . at the same time , using transient thz spectroscopy , wehrenfennig and coworkers have shown that ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 exhibits long charge - carrier diffusion lengths , exceeding 1  @xmath6 m , and a high - frequency mobility of 8  @xmath3/vs , an indeed remarkable result for a solution - processed material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they inferred that the low bimolecular recombination rate arises from a spatial separation of electrons and holes in the system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , early dielectric measurements  @xcite suggest a picosecond relaxation process at room temperature .    to our knowledge , to date no theoretical calculations have addressed the problem of evaluating the conductivity and charge mobility in hybrid perovskites . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this gap in the knowledge and by the intriguing rle that the charge transport is expected to play , here we present a first - principles analysis of the transport properties of organolead halide perovskites . in particular we consider the methyl - ammonium lead - iodide perovskite , ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 , which is the archetype of this class of materials . </S>",
    "<S> the cubic , tetragonal , and orthorhombic phases are explored . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , depending on the phase of the material and the doping level , the mobility spans a range between 5 and 12  @xmath3/vs for holes and 2.5 and 10  @xmath3/vs for electrons . furthermore , our results suggest that cl doping has little impact on the transport properties .    the electronic structure of ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 has been calculated with the all - electron fhi - aims code at the level of the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> long - range van der waals interactions are included via the tkatchenko and scheffler ( ts ) scheme  @xcite , which is constructed over a gga and a pairwise dispersive potential . in order to verify the goodness of the bandstructure , additional calculations with the hse @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> hse06  @xcite functional have been performed . </S>",
    "<S> since these give us rather similar mobilities than those obtained with gga , the results are not presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal space integration was performed over an 8@xmath78@xmath78 monkhorst - pack grid  @xcite in the case of the cubic cell , and a 6@xmath76@xmath74 one for both the tetragonal and the orthorhombic . a pre - constructed high - accuracy all - electron basis set of numerical atomic orbitals </S>",
    "<S> was employed , as provided by the fhi - aims `` tight '' default option . </S>",
    "<S> structural optimization was performed with the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno algorithm  @xcite , with the crystal geometry determined by optimizing both the internal coordinates and the supercell lattice vectors with a tolerance of @xmath8  ev /   and with the constraint of orthogonal cell vectors </S>",
    "<S> .    the charge mobility has been determined by mean of the semiclassical boltzmann theory within the constant relaxation time approximation , as implemented in the boltztrap code  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the code has been interfaced with fhi - aims and uses the fhi - aims - calculated wave - functions and eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> a very dense @xmath9-point sampling of 32@xmath732@xmath732 ( 32768 @xmath9-points over the full brillouin zone ) has been employed for the cubic cell , while for the tetragonal and orthorhombic cells it was reduced to 18@xmath718@xmath712 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly summarize the key steps of the scheme . from the first - principles bandstructure , @xmath10 , the @xmath11 component of the group velocity for a charge carrier in the @xmath12-th band </S>",
    "<S> is obtained as @xmath13 and used to compute the conductivity tensor @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electronic charge and @xmath16 is the relaxation time . by integrating @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , one can extract the conductivity as a function of the temperature , @xmath18 , and the chemical potential , @xmath19 , @xmath20   \\sigma_{\\alpha,\\beta}(i,{\\bf k } ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the fermi - dirac distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath19 is determined by the number of free carriers or , equivalently , by their concentration . </S>",
    "<S> once the conductivity is known , the charge mobility reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the free carrier ( electron or hole ) concentration . </S>",
    "<S> while eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3 ] ) is in principle exact within the semiclassical theory , it is very hard to compute unless some assumptions are taken . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for practical purposes the transport properties are calculated by introducing two approximations : ( i ) the relaxation time @xmath24 is constant , i.e. it is independent of the temperature , the band index and the chemical potential ; ( ii ) the band structure is treated as independent of temperature or doping and , therefore , is fixed independently of the chemical potential . nonetheless , despite such approximations , the method has been successful to predict the transport and thermoelectric properties of many materials  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will mainly focus on the tetragonal phase , the room temperature one , but results will be presented also for the cubic and orthorhombic . </S>",
    "<S> the geometries for the three phases are optimised by initializing the structures according to the experimental diffraction data  @xcite . in order to determine the impact of the molecular orientation on the stabilization of the inorganic matrix , which we previously discussed in the case of the cubic cell  @xcite , we consider two initial orientations for the ch@xmath5nh@xmath5 molecule , namely along ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxed structures are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] and will be referred to as _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra1 _ and _ tetra2 _ , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the configurational energy minimum is strongly correlated to the orientation of the organic cations , in fact by only twisting the methyl - ammonium orientation two qualitatively different configurations emerge . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our calculations confirm the strong mutual connection between the organic and inorganic subsystems . as a result of the interaction between the n and the i species , the ( 001 ) orientation induces an alternate tilting of the pbi@xmath2 octahedra of @xmath25 with respect to the ( 001 ) axis [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) ] . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the ( 110 ) orientation induces an alternate tilting of the same amount , @xmath25 , in the ( 110 ) plane [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) ] , while no disorder occurs along the ( 001 ) axis . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice parameter of _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra1 _ and _ tetra2 _ are 9.01   8.72   12.36    and 8.71   8.71   12.78    respectively , in agreement with experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of such two configurations is also similar , differing by @xmath26  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic band structures of the two tetragonal phases look also very similar , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that the bottom of the conduction band mainly originates from the @xmath27 orbitals of pb , while the top of the valence band is derived from the @xmath27 orbitals of i. the homo and lumo of methyl - ammonium are located approximately at @xmath28  ev below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the major difference in the bandstructure consists in a reduction of the gap from @xmath29  ev to @xmath30  ev in the case of _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra2 _ , arising from a downshift of the pb-@xmath31 band at the conduction band edge , with a larger separation from the manyfold composed of a mixture of pb-@xmath27 and i-@xmath32 bands . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the band curvature increases around @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> a larger conductance close to the conduction band edge is thus expected for _ tetra2_. the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor , @xmath34 , for the three phases of ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] as a function of the chemical potential . in the cubic phase </S>",
    "<S> the metal sublattice is almost isotropic along the three unit cell dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although the molecular cations may have different orientations , we find that the conductivity itself is isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the bands around the fermi level , @xmath35 , originate only from pb and i. in contrast , due to symmetry lowering the conductivity of the tetragonal and orthorhombic structures displays a significant anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> for both _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra1 _ and _ tetra2 _ , @xmath36 and @xmath37 assume very similar values . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in _ tetra1 _ @xmath38 is larger than @xmath39 , while for _ tetra2 _ we see the opposite behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained in terms of the distortion of the octahedra . in _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra1 _ , the octahedra tilting occurs along the @xmath40 axis , therefore the overlap of the i-@xmath27 orbital reduces and the transport along that direction is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the disorder in _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra2 _ is mainly in the @xmath41 plane , while along @xmath40 the i - pb - i bonds are aligned causing @xmath39 to be larger . for the orthorhombic geometry , being it qualitatively similar to _ tetra2 _ , the same considerations can be made . </S>",
    "<S> we point out here that our calculations are performed without the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , soc is known to play a role in lead - iodide materials , mainly due to the presence of pb . however , after comparing the bandstructures with those obtained with soc , we noticed that the major effect is a renormalization of the energy gap . for completeness , we computed the effective masses along two high - symmetry directions around the @xmath33 point with and without the soc , as reported in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:1 ] . in agreement with previous calculations  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that the effect of soc is sizeable , yet not dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> we can now turn our discussion to the mobility , which has been calculated from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) by considering @xmath42  ps , as determined experimentally in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement that we find between our calculated mobilities and those recently measured experimentally suggests that such estimate is indeed a valid one . </S>",
    "<S> the specially averaged holes and electrons mobilities , @xmath6 , are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] as a function of the charge carrier concentration , @xmath23 , a quantity that is experimentally hard to determine with certainty , as it depends on the device processing , and on the presence of defects and impurities . </S>",
    "<S> it has been often argued that in most of the measurements @xmath23 is actually very low , corresponding to a nearly intrinsic semiconductor  @xcite . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show a generally weak dependence of the mobility on carrier concentration for both electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we predict mobilities ranging from 5 to 12  @xmath3/vs for holes and from 2.5 to 10  @xmath3/vs for electrons . </S>",
    "<S> these values are in excellent agreement with the most recent measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when one compares the different phases it appears clear that the cubic structure presents the highest mobility for holes and for electrons in the high doping regime . </S>",
    "<S> then for holes the mobility of all the other phases is essentially the same , while for electrons there is more spread with the _ tetra2 _ and _ tetra1 _ displaying the highest and lowest values , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this essentially follows the size of the relative effective masses , as shown in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is however important to remark that at room temperature the molecules in the tetragonal phase are almost free to rotate , so that one expects the actual measured mobility to compare with an average of those of _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra1 _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> tetra2_.    in light of our results , we suggest that the spectacular light - harvesting performances of perovskite solar cells should not be ascribed to large charge carrier mobilities , as previously speculated  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . although the values that we have found are to be considered large for solution processed materials , they are not substantial in absolute terms , in particular if compared to those of conventional semiconductors like si or ge , which are three orders of magnitude larger . as such </S>",
    "<S> , the exceptionally long carrier lifetime of hybrid perovskites should be considered as the principal source of their high efficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> a still outstanding issue is whether or not mixing cl and i ( cl doping ) has an impact on the charge transport of hybrid perovskites . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has been argued that cl doping would improve the charge transport within the perovskite layer  @xcite , giving rise to better performance in solar cell devices . </S>",
    "<S> other works have shown that mixed halide perovskites have a bimolecular recombination rate an order of magnitude lower than that of their tri - iodide counterpart.@xcite . in order to partially solve this issue </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the average mobilities of ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath43cl@xmath44 for @xmath45 [ see lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig:4 ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations have been performed here for the tetragonal structure . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the mobility assumes values comprised between 2 - 5  @xmath3/vs , i.e. it lies within the same order of magnitude than ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 , regardless of the cl doping level . clearly our results represent only an upper bound in this case , since impurity scattering may lower down the relaxation time and hence the mobility . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we neglect here the effect arising from the spontaneous disorder of alloys , therefore we consider only the crystalline component of the mobility . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our estimate suggests that the improvement in the device efficiency has a different origin , and we endorse the idea that cl doping does not have much detrimental effects on the transport but may help the crystalline growth of the material .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider an additional aspect . </S>",
    "<S> it is understood that dynamic effects play a key role in materials containing organic and inorganic sublattices . as mentioned before , at room temperature the organic cations </S>",
    "<S> are free to rotate , and recent studies suggest that the typical time scale for the ch@xmath5nh@xmath5 rotation is of the order of 1  ps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus interested in determining the impact of the lattice dynamics on the transport properties of this class of materials . to this end , we have performed born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics ( md ) at 300  k with a cubic 2@xmath7 2@xmath72 supercell of ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbi@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is kept constant by the use of the bussi - donadio - parrinello thermostat  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system is thermalized with a 5  ps run , and the dynamics of the following 1  ps is subsequently analyzed . in this time interval , the electronic bandgap is found to have an average value of @xmath46  ev and a mean square deviation of @xmath47  mev . </S>",
    "<S> we have sampled 20 equally spaced frames of the last @xmath48  ps , and computed the boltzmann transport conductivity ( @xmath49 ) as previously for the selected configurations . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:5 ] displays the heat plot of the conductivity as a function of the chemical potential @xmath19 and the time during the last ps of the md trajectory . by inspecting the trajectory </S>",
    "<S> , we can also confirm that the cation orientation fluctuates , i.e. that the ma molecule rotates within that time interval . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the variation of the total cation polarization , which is depicted with triangles in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> such quantity is bound between 0 and 1 , and clearly spans almost all the range within 1  ps . </S>",
    "<S> the bandgap variations , due to the molecular rotation , are clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , apart from this minor effect , the conductivity remains independent of the thermal configurational fluctuations , especially close to the band edges . </S>",
    "<S> more noticeable differences appear at @xmath50  ev above the cbm , which however is not relevant to transport in realistic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis confirm that our results are robust against dynamical effects caused by thermal fluctuations . as a final consideration , </S>",
    "<S> we want to emphasize that our analysis can be taken as a tool for extracting the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the good agreement between our calculations and the most recent experiments sets the relaxation time in the ps range . </S>",
    "<S> this is the typical time scale of the ch@xmath5nh@xmath5 rotation at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the mobility is probably limited by phonon scattering , in particular from those soft vibrations involving the interplay between the organic / inorganic sublattices , which is responsible for the carrier relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> this work motivates further study on the theoretical determination of @xmath24 accounting for the electron - phonon scattering and for the other sources of scattering like impurities and defects . in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated the charge carrier mobilities of hybrid pb - halide perovskites , by using a combination of rigorous density functional theory and semiclassical boltzmann transport in the constant relaxation time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the calculated mobilities are in the experimental range , once the relaxation time is taken to be 1  ps . </S>",
    "<S> the particular crystal structure and the possibility of cl doping do not affect the above results significantly .    </S>",
