    "as location - based services become widely deployed , the importance of verifying the location information being fed into the location service is becoming a critical security issue .",
    "the main difference between a location verification system ( lvs ) and a localization system is that we are confronted by some _ a priori _ information , such as a claimed position in the lvs @xcite . in the context of a main target application of our system , namely intelligent transport systems ( its ) ,",
    "the issue of location verification has attracted a considerable amount of recent attention @xcite .",
    "normally , in order to infer whether a network user or node is malicious ( attempting to spoof location ) or legitimate ( actually at the claimed location ) , we have to set a threshold for the lvs .",
    "this threshold is set so as to obtain low false positive rates for legitimate users and high detection rates for malicious users .",
    "as such , the specific value of the threshold will directly affect the performance of an lvs .    one traditional approach to set the threshold of an lvs is to search for a tradeoff between false positive rate and detection rate according to receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve @xcite .",
    "another technique is to obtain the false positive and detection rates through empirical training data and minimize specific functions of the two rates to set the threshold @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the sum of false positive and false negative rates were minimized .",
    "however , although successful in many scenarios , the approaches mentioned above do not specify in any formal sense what the ` optimal ' threshold value of an lvs should be .",
    "in addition , in our key target application of our lvs , namely its , it is not practical to collect the required training data due to the variable circumstances .",
    "the main point of this paper is to develop for the first time an information theoretic framework that will allow us to formally set the optimal threshold of an lvs . in order to do this ,",
    "we first define a threshold based on the squared mahalanobis distance , which utilizes the fisher information matrix ( fim ) associated with the location information metrics utilized by the lvs . to optimize the threshold , the intrusion detection capability ( idc ) proposed by gu @xmath0 @xcite for an intrusion detection system ( ids ) will be utilized .",
    "the idc is the ratio of the reduction of uncertainty of the ids input given the output . as such",
    ", the idc measures the capability of an ids to classify the input events correctly .",
    "a larger idc means that the lvs has an improved capability of classifying users as malicious or legitimate accurately . from an information theoretic point of view",
    "the optimal threshold is the value that maximizes the idc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the system model , which details the observation model and the threat model we utilize . in section  3",
    ", the threshold is defined in terms of the fim associated with the location metrics .",
    "section  3 also provides the techniques used to determine the false positive and detection rates , which are utilized to derive the idc .",
    "section  4 provides the details of how the idc is used in the optimizing the threshold .",
    "simulation results which validate our new analytical lvs framework are presented in section  5 .",
    "section  6 concludes and discusses some future directions .",
    "let us assume a user could obtain its true position , @xmath1 $ ] , from its localization equipment ( @xmath2 , gps ) , and that the localization error is zero .",
    "thus , a legitimate user s claimed ( reported ) position , @xmath3 $ ] , is exactly the same as its true position @xmath4 .",
    "however , a malicious user will falsify ( spoof ) its claimed position in an attempt to fool the lvs .",
    "we denote the legitimate and malicious hypothesis as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and the _ a priori _ information can be summarized as @xmath7      although the framework we develop can be built on any location information metric , for purposes of illustration in this work we will solely investigate the case where the location information metric is the received signal strength ( rss ) obtained by a base station ( bs ) from a user .",
    "the rss of the @xmath8-th bs from a legitimate user , @xmath9 , is assumed to be given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a reference received power , @xmath12 is the reference distance , @xmath13 is the path loss exponent , @xmath14 is a zero - mean normal random variable with variance @xmath15 , the euclidean distance of the @xmath8-th bs to the user s true position @xmath16 $ ] is @xmath17 where @xmath18   $ ] is the location of the @xmath8-th bs , and @xmath19 is the number of bss . for @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ prior ] ) , @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ observ ] ) can be replaced by @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the euclidean distance of the @xmath8-th bs to the user s claimed position @xmath22 $ ] and can be expressed as @xmath23      let us assume a malicious user knows the positions of all bss and is able to boost its transmit power according to its claimed positions .",
    "the rss of the @xmath8-th bs from a malicious user , @xmath24 , can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the boost power .",
    "we assume the malicious user is equipped with only one omni - antenna , and thus @xmath26 is constant for all the bss .    in the following , one strategy to set a boost value of @xmath26 for the malicious user will be provided . a malicious user s claimed position",
    "is determined by its purpose and lvs parameters .",
    "constrained by the positions of all bss , the spoofed observations @xmath9 are not exactly the same as the ideal observations @xmath27 calculated according to its claimed position as follows @xmath28 however , the malicious user would like to spoof the observations @xmath9 as similar as possible to the ideal observations @xmath27 .",
    "thus , it will set a value of @xmath26 to minimize the divergence between @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "this divergence can be defined by the mean square error ( mse ) as follows @xmath29 ^ 2\\right\\}\\\\ \\nonumber      & = & \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[p_x - 10\\gamma \\log(\\frac{d_i^t}{d_0 } ) + 10\\gamma \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_i^c}{d_0}\\right)\\right]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the expectation with respect to all the observations .",
    "then , the value of @xmath26 can be expressed as @xmath31 .",
    "taking the first derivative of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath26 and setting it to zero , we can obtain @xmath33 as @xmath34 in the above we use @xmath35 instead of @xmath8 in the equations related to @xmath33 to avoid confusion them with the @xmath5 observation model .",
    "substituting @xmath33 into eq .",
    "( [ threat ] ) , the threat model ( observation model based on @xmath6 ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37 eq .",
    "( [ threat1 ] ) is the general threat model based on rss , but it is not practical since a malicious user s true position is unknown . we can approximate the threat model by assuming @xmath4 follows a distribution . here , due to the limited space ,",
    "let us assume a malicious user has an approximate infinite distance away from all bss to facilitate the lvs ( the more general case is discussed later ) .",
    "given this assumption , all the bss distance s from the user converge to one value .",
    "that is , the distance of a malicious user s true position to every bs is nearly a constant number @xmath38 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath40 can be rewritten as @xmath41 based on the above analysis , the threat model can be expressed as @xmath42",
    "in this section , we first present our threshold based on the squared mahalanobis distance , which utilizes the inverse fim .",
    "then , we provide techniques used to determine the false positive rate @xmath43 and the detection rate @xmath44 of our lvs .      the threshold is defined in terms of the squared mahalanobis distance of an estimated position vector @xmath45 $ ] .. in this alternative description , an error ellipse is derived directly from the fim , with the scale of the ellipse being set by @xmath46 and the orientation being set by the eigenvectors of the inverse fim . for different values of the threshold @xmath47 the ellipse size scales as @xmath48 , and the detection algorithm decides the user is malicious if the estimated position returned by the location mle lies outside of the ellipse . ]",
    "the squared mahalanobis distance can be expressed as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the covariance matrix of @xmath51 . according to the definition of @xmath53 ,",
    "it is a dimensionless scalar and involves not only the euclidean distance but also the geometric information . in an lvs , we are interested in the ` distance ' between a user s estimated position @xmath51 and its claimed position @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we will use @xmath54 instead of @xmath50 to calculate @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , without any _ a priori _ results from a localization algorithms , we can not obtain any estimate of the covariance matrix @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we will utilize the inverse fim , @xmath55 , to approximate @xmath52 . with this , the squared mahalanobis distance in our lvs can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the fim to be calculated as given below . in practice",
    ", the lvs works on the observation model based on @xmath5 , and the likelihood function of received powers can be obtained using eq .",
    "( [ observ ] ) .",
    "let us assume the observations received by different bss are independent , then the log - likelihood function can be expressed as @xmath59 ^ 2 + \\log   \\mathbf{c}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the @xmath19-dimension observation vector and the constant number @xmath61 is @xmath62 then , we can calculate the terms of the fim through @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 represents the expectation operation with respect to all observations .",

    "thus , the general form of @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath67}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the threshold @xmath47 can be encapsulated within the equation for an ellipse as follows @xmath68 therefore , the threshold @xmath47 can also be understood as an ellipse , denoted as @xmath69 , which is determined by extending the error ellipse provided by the fim with the threshold parameter @xmath47 .",
    "based on the above analysis , the overall process of an lvs includes four steps    * collect observations of the rss received from a user by each bs ; * apply a localization algorithm to obtain an estimated position @xmath70 ; * calculate the squared mahalanobis distance @xmath71 of @xmath70 to the user s claimed position @xmath72 ; * infer if the user is legitimate or malicious according to the decision rule in eq .",
    "( [ rule ] ) .    in practice ,",
    "the above are all the steps of our lvs . however , to evaluate an lvs , false positive and detection rates , which are functions of the threshold parameter @xmath47 and other lvs parameters , are always investigated in theory . in the following subsections , we provide techniques used to determine false positive and detection rates in order to optimize the threshold parameter @xmath47 .      the false positive rate @xmath43 is the probability by which legitimate users are judged as malicious ones . for a legitimate user , @xmath73 .",
    "then , in the 2-d physical space , the false positive rate can be expressed as @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the true positive rate ( @xmath75 ) is a well known metric that underlies the performance of unbiased localization algorithms .",
    "for example , in the 2-d physical space , it states that the probability by which an estimated position lies within the ellipse with @xmath76 is no more than @xmath77 .",
    "the detection rate @xmath44 is the probability that malicious users are recognized as malicious ones . in order to calculate @xmath44",

    ", if the user is malicious the observed signal vector @xmath60 will be one that has undergone a boost as described by eq .",
    "( [ threat2 ] ) .",
    "let us denote the average value of this spoofed observation vector as @xmath81 .",
    "given this , the likelihood function @xmath82 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ observ ] ) .",

    "from an information theoretic point of view , the idc is a metric that measures the capability of an ids to classify the input events correctly and is defined as @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the entropy of the input data @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the mutual information of input data @xmath95 and output data @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the conditional entropy . mutual information",

    "accordingly , the false positive rate @xmath43 is the probability @xmath107 , and detection rate @xmath44 is the probability @xmath108 .",

    "the simulated values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are calculated directly according to the realizations of estimated positions , and then the simulated @xmath102 is obtained from eq .",

    "the simulation parameters are shown in the figure caption and the theoretical optimal value @xmath113 can be seen to be @xmath118 ( note that in all the figures explicitly shown in this paper the four bss are fixed at the corners of a 200 m  x  200 m grid ) .",
    "the comparison between simulation and analysis shows excellent agreement . beyond the simulations explicitly shown in fig.1",
    ", we have investigated a range of other fixed bss positions ( up to 10 bss whose positions are randomly selected ) , and these simulation also show excellent agreement with simulations .",
    "collectively , these simulation results verify the analysis we have provided earlier .",
    "the simulation results with a malicious user having a certain distance to all bss are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the true position of the malicious user in the simulations is set at 10 km away from the claimed position .",
    "although the simulation and theoretical values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath102 do not match with each other exactly ( the theoretical analysis approximates the user as being at infinity ) , the simulation and theoretical optimal values @xmath113 are effectively the same .",
    "we find this result holds down to distance where the malicious user is a few km away from the claimed position .",
    "this shows that our framework is tenable when the assumption that malicious user is infinitely far away is relaxed down to the few km range .",
    "in order to verify the @xmath102 with the optimal value @xmath113 is correct , we also simulated @xmath102 for a range of @xmath15 .",
    "3 shows such results for the case where the user malicious user if effectively at infinity . here",
    "the optimal value @xmath113 is derived from the proposed theoretical analysis , but in the simulations the threshold is set to the other values of t shown ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) . from the results shown we can see that these other values do provide simulated false positive and detection rates which result in lower values of @xmath102 ( and therefore sub - optimal performance ) , which once again verifies the robustness of our analytical framework .",
    "4 shows the same results except that the malicious user is again set at 10 km away from the claimed position .",
    "again we see a validation of our analysis .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a novel and rigorous information theoretic framework for an lvs .",
    "the theoretical framework we have developed shows how the value of the threshold used in the detection of a spoofed location can be optimized in terms of the mutual information between the input and output data . in order to verify the legitimacy of our framework",
    "we have carried out detailed numerical simulations of our framework under the assumption of an idealized threat model in which the malicious user is far enough from the claimed location such that his boosted signal strength results in all bss receiving the same rss ( modulo noise ) .",
    "our numerical simulations mimic the practical scenario where a system deployed using our framework must make a binary yes / no  malicious decision \" to each snapshot of rss values obtained by the bss .",
    "the comparison between simulation and analysis shows excellent agreement .",
    "other simulations where we modify the approximation of constant rss at bss also showed very good agreement with analysis .",
    "the work described in this paper formalises the performance of an optimal lvs system under the simplest ( and perhaps most likely scenario ) , where a single malicious user attempts to spoof his location to a wider wireless network .",
    "the practical scenario we had in mind whilst carrying out our simulations was in an its where another vehicle is attempting to provide falsified location information the wider vehicular network .",
    "future work related our new framework will include the formal inclusion of more sophisticated threat models , where the malicious user is both closer to the claimed location and has the use of colluding adversaries .",
    "it is well known that no lvs can be made foolproof under the colluding adversary scenario , however , we will investigate in a formal information theoretic sense the detailed nature of the vulnerability of an lvs under such different threat models .",
