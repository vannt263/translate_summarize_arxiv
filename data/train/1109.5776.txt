    "brane - world models have proved to be very useful for model building , providing a way to not only address the hierarchy problem in the standard model  @xcite , but also to explain the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixings  @xcite .",
    "a variety of constructions are usually employed with fields , other than gravity , in the bulk and/or on the branes .",
    "furthermore , aided by the ads / cft correspondence , a dual description of strongly coupled four - dimensional ( 4d ) gauge theories can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "these fields are normally treated as test fields , where the corresponding energy density is sufficiently small not to disturb the background geometry .",
    "therefore , for a given geometry one performs a kaluza - klein ( kk ) decomposition . solving the field equations in this geometry gives the bulk profile and the eigenmasses of the kk modes .",
    "the profile , in turn , determines the couplings of the kk modes .",
    "eventually , a complete model has to provide the dynamical elements that determine the bulk geometry , and the brane positions ( when present ) .",
    "as an example , the randall - sundrum model @xcite , does not solve the hierarchy problem until the exact location of the tev brane is fully specified .",
    "most of stabilization mechanisms , starting from @xcite , typically employ one scalar field , due to its simplicity .",
    "the system of perturbations in the presence of a bulk scalar was studied , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis considered the properties of various excitations coupled to sm fields , which were assumed to be localized on the brane .",
    "of particular relevance was the study of the radion , which is the lightest of these scalar perturbations .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was limited to a regime of small backreaction of the bulk scalars on the bulk geometry .",
    "later , @xcite generalized this study to a bulk field with arbitrary bulk / brane potential .    however , there are systems in which more than one dynamical scalar field is relevant . for instance , in the soft - wall model of @xcite , two bulk scalar fields are used to obtain a solution of the einstein equations . furthermore in string theory , multiple scalar fields ( such as the dilaton and moduli fields ) are quite common .",
    "this motivates generalizing the study of @xcite to the case of @xmath0 bulk ( real ) scalar fields , which will be presented in this paper .",
    "the generalization to @xmath0 bulk scalar fields has also been previously considered in refs .  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we make no assumption on the form of the bulk and boundary potentials .",
    "the perturbations are obtained by studying the linearized problem .",
    "it is useful to distinguish them as scalar / vector / tensor modes under lorentz transformations of the ordinary 4d spacetime : we assume that the noncompact space has a minkowski metric . as a consequence",
    "the scalar / vector / tensor modes are decoupled from each other at the linearized level and therefore can be studied separately .",
    "the mode count proceeds as follows .",
    "there are 15 perturbations in the five - dimensional ( 5d ) metric , and @xmath0 perturbations from the bulk ( real ) scalar fields . of these ,",
    "@xmath1 are nondynamical and 5 more can be removed by a gauge choice .",
    "this leaves @xmath2 modes of which , @xmath1 are in the tensor sector ( transverse and traceless @xmath3 ) and @xmath0 remain as scalar modes .",
    "there are no vector modes .",
    "finally , there is a scalar mode for each brane ( representing the fluctuation of its bulk position ) ; however , we show that these modes are not excited as long as the branes have only a tension ( namely , no other brane source with a different equation of state is dynamically relevant ; this is the usual assumption in brane compactifications ) and so we will ignore them .    it is technically challenging to identify the @xmath0 scalar degrees of freedom because they can arise either from the components of the metric perturbations or the actual bulk scalar field perturbations .",
    "the number can be reduced to @xmath0 by using constraint equations to derive a manageable set of closed equations for the @xmath0 modes .",
    "this must be done for both the bulk and brane equations .",
    "the latter equations are boundary conditions and we will consider both cases either with or without branes at the boundaries ( in the second case , the boundary condition is typically given by the requirement of normalizability ) .",
    "we derive this system of equations , which for convenience is written as an eigenvalue problem , with the appropriate number of equations needed to obtain a solution .",
    "our goal is to provide an explicit formulation of the eigenvalue problem that can be used to study any 5d model with an arbitrary number of bulk scalar fields . by solving the eigenvalue problem the physical properties of the perturbations ( masses and couplings )",
    "can be obtained .",
    "this can then be used to check the stability of the model , so that if @xmath4 for some scalar modes , the background solution is unstable .    while the eigenvalue problem may be solved analytically for the simplest cases , in general a numerical method",
    "is needed to obtain a solution .",
    "we will employ the shooting method since the boundary equations at one boundary leave freedom for the choice of the mode functions , and of the mass eigenvalue .",
    "we show that , for @xmath0 scalars , the boundary conditions at one of the two boundaries leave @xmath0 unspecified quantities .",
    "the bulk equations are then used to evolve the solution to the other boundary , where there are precisely @xmath0 constraints that must be satisfied ( given by the boundary condition at this boundary ) .",
    "if these constraints are satisfied , then a physical mode has been found .    as an example of the numerical method , we study the perturbation properties , and the stability problem , for the dynamical soft wall model of ref .",
    "the model is characterized by two scalar fields with a coupled potential term .",
    "it is interesting because it leads to a kk mass spectrum with linear regge - like trajectories , similar to the hadron spectrum in qcd .",
    "we conduct a dense scan in parameter space and find approximately 100 modes with positive @xmath5 , and no mode with negative @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we find an interesting behavior of the radion mass .",
    "the mass is suppressed by a large logarithm , that in the dual cft interpretation corresponds to how scale invariance is broken by quantum corrections .",
    "this is the same suppression present in the goldberger - wise mechanism @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ models ] we introduce the class of models that we are studying ; we present the lagrangian , the background solutions , and the most general set of perturbations . in the following three sections we study the scalar , vector , and tensor perturbations , respectively .",
    "we identify the physical modes , and perform their kaluza - klein decomposition .",
    "we provide the explicit closed set of equations which can be solved to obtain the mass and the bulk profile of these modes through a boundary value problem . in section [ eigen - problem ]",
    "we formalize this boundary value problem for the two sectors ( scalar and tensor ) that contain physical perturbations . in section",
    "[ soft ] we study the perturbations of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite as an example of how to use our formalism to solve the eigenvalue problem . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we briefly summarize our main findings .",
    "some more technical steps are then given in the three appendices .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide the tools for studying the perturbations , and the stability , of a wide class of models with one extra dimension and @xmath0 bulk scalar fields @xmath6 . specifically , we consider models characterized by the action @xmath7 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\sum_{\\rm branes } \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-\\gamma } \\left\\ { 2 m^3 \\left [ k \\right]_j + u \\left",

    "contains the bulk terms , which are restricted to lie between two boundary branes , if they are both present , or else either between a boundary brane and infinity , or between @xmath9 .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath10 is adopted from @xcite , where the bulk was assumed to be @xmath11 symmetric across each brane , and the symmetry was accounted for by restricting the bulk integral only to one side of each brane .",
    "this notation will also be used here , even in the cases where one or both branes are absent ; it is trivial to reabsorb this factor away by a rescaling of @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the scalars have a standard kinetic term in the bulk .",
    "notice that the choice of sign for the kinetic term corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "if present , a bulk cosmological constant is included as a constant term in @xmath13 .",
    "the second line in ( [ action ] ) is instead the brane action ; @xmath15 denotes the induced metric on the brane , and the notation @xmath16_j$ ] with subscript @xmath17 denotes the jump of the quantity inside the square parenthesis across the brane , which in this case is the extrinsic curvature @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the potential of the scalars on the brane ( which is a function of the value that the @xmath12 fields have at the brane location ) , and , if present , a brane tension is included as a constant term in @xmath19 ( note that when both boundary terms are present , we do not require them to be equal ) .",
    "in addition we disregard the possibility of brane kinetic terms for the scalar fields .    from the action ( [ action ] ) we obtain the einstein equations in the bulk @xmath20 where capital latin indices run over all the coordinates and the energy momentum tensor",

    "the explicit definition and computation of the induced metric and the extrinsic curvature are given in appendix a.      at the background level , we assume a factorizable geometry with 4d minkowski slices : @xmath29~.\\ ] ] it follows that the background bulk scalars can have a nontrivial dependence on the extra coordinate only : @xmath30 the only nontrivial equations in ( [ einstein - eq ] ) then arise from the diagonal @xmath31 , and @xmath32 components .",
    "we write here one linear combination of these two equations , and the @xmath33 component : @xmath34 where prime @xmath35 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the scalar equations ( [ scalar - eq ] ) give instead @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to check that the first equation of ( [ ein - bck ] ) can be derived by combining ( [ sca - eq - bck ] ) and the second equation of ( [ ein - bck ] ) ( this redundancy is a consequence of a nontrivial component of the bianchi identity ) .    from the background expressions of the induced metric and the extrinsic curvature given in appendix a , the israel conditions ( [ israel ] ) have only a nontrivial part proportional to @xmath38 : @xmath39 while the boundary conditions ( [ jun - phi ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath40 where @xmath41",
    ". the upper ( lower ) sign at the right hand side of these two equations refers to a brane at the left ( right ) of the bulk interval .",
    "if one or both branes are absent , equations ( [ bou - bck - ein ] ) and ( [ bou - bck - phi ] ) can be replaced by different boundary conditions at spatial infinity along the bulk .    in the study of the perturbations , we often make use of the background equations written in this subsection in order to simplify the linearized equations for the perturbations , without writing this explicitly each time .      it is convenient to characterize the perturbations according to how they transform under 4d lorentz transformations . due to the background symmetry ,",
    "modes that transform differently under these transformations are decoupled at the linearized level , and can be studied separately in our analysis . we therefore have the following decomposition @xmath42~ , \\nonumber\\\\ g_{\\mu 5 } & = & a^2 \\left ( z \\right ) \\left [   \\partial_\\mu b + b_\\mu \\right]~ ,   \\nonumber\\\\ g_{5 5 } & = & a^2 \\left ( z \\right ) \\left [ 1 + 2 \\ , \\phi \\right]~. \\label{metric - modes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the modes @xmath43 are scalar ( with respect to 4d lorentz transformations ) ; the modes @xmath44 are vector ( we impose that they are transverse , @xmath45 ) , and @xmath3 is a tensor ( imposed to be symmetric , transverse , and traceless , @xmath46 ) .",
    "there are also additional scalar modes : the perturbations , @xmath47 of the bulk scalars @xmath48 , and the perturbations , @xmath49 of the brane positions @xmath50 ( @xmath51 runs over the number of branes ) .",
    "all the perturbations are functions of both @xmath52 and @xmath32 , except for @xmath49 which are functions of @xmath52 only .",
    "note that the decomposition ( [ metric - modes ] ) becomes ambiguous for massless scalar kk modes , but can be studied using the light cone decomposition of  @xcite .",
    "we assume that there are no massless scalar modes in the cases of interest .",
    "we need to fix the freedom of general coordinate transformations . under the infinitesimal transformation @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) the metric changes as @xmath55    we can use this relation to see how the various modes in ( [ metric - modes ] ) transform . in particular we obtain : @xmath56 where we have only given the transformations relevant for the present discussion .",
    "this allows us to set @xmath57 in ( [ metric - modes ] ) and removes the freedom of the transformations in ( [ change ] ) characterized by @xmath58 .",
    "similarly we can also set @xmath59 in ( [ metric - modes ] ) , which fixes @xmath60 , and choosing @xmath61 then fixes @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we see that one can always choose the gauge @xmath63 ; this completely fixes the freedom of the coordinate transformations ( [ change ] ) .",
    "this leaves the sets of scalar @xmath64 , vector @xmath65 and tensor @xmath66 modes ; these three systems are decoupled from each other at the linearized level , and we will study them separately in the following three sections .",
    "in this section we write the linearized equations for the scalar perturbations .",
    "the main goal is to remove the nondynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "as we wrote in the last paragraph of the previous section , we start from the system of perturbations @xmath64 , where @xmath67 runs over the number of bulk scalars ( @xmath0 ) , while @xmath51 runs over the number of branes .",
    "we can immediately show that the brane displacements are decoupled , and do not introduce any instability .",
    "they only enter in the boundary conditions .",
    "specifically , let us assume that a brane is present and consider the linearization of ( [ israel ] ) at that location ( omitting the index @xmath51 on the displacement @xmath49 ) .",
    "using the results in appendix a , we obtain @xmath68_j \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad=\\frac{u}{m^3 } a^3\\left ( 1 + 2 \\psi \\right ) \\eta_{\\mu \\nu}~. \\label{israel - scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( note that @xmath19 also has a perturbation part ) .",

    "using the @xmath11 symmetry at the brane , and the fact that @xmath70 is odd , this equation in turns gives @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the dalembertian operator in 4d minkowski space .",
    "as is well known for the single scalar case , the brane bending mode is not sourced by the scalar fields , and is just a decoupled massless mode in the current context .",
    "therefore , in the following we simply disregard this brane mode(s ) .    we are left with the @xmath73 scalar perturbations @xmath74 . as we discussed in the introduction , there are only @xmath0 physical perturbations in the scalar sector . in subsection",
    "[ scalar - bulk ] we present the linearized bulk equations for the scalars , and show how the two nondynamical modes can be eliminated from two constraint equations .",
    "we actually define @xmath0 scalar combinations @xmath75 , that correspond to the canonical variables of the system . in the following three subsections",
    "we then compute the boundary conditions for these variables for different relevant cases .",

    "this equation does not provide any additional information with respect to the bulk equations .",
    "we can indeed rewrite the right hand side in terms of bulk quantities using eq.([bou - bck - phi ] ) ; the resulting equation is simply the constraint equation ( [ con2 ] ) at the brane location .",
    "the linearization of ( [ jun - phi ] ) is instead nontrivial : @xmath85 where again the left hand side is evaluated in the bulk immediately next to the brane .",
    "the role of the boundary conditions is to complement the bulk equations ( [ eq - v ] ) and form an eigenvalue problem that can be immediately solved to obtain the physical scalar excitations of the system . by looking at eqs .",
    "( [ eq - v ] ) , we see that the most useful form in which these equations can be written is @xmath86 , where the coefficients @xmath87 depend on background quantities .",
    "considerable algebra is required to obtain this equation starting from ( [ jun2 ] ) .",
    "the final result is @xmath88 which are indeed equivalent to ( [ jun2 ] ) ( we show this in appendix c ) .",
    "we stress that these equations are valid at the brane location ; brane quantities are evaluated immediately next to the brane , and whenever an upper / lower sign appears on the right hand side , it refers to a brane at the left / right of the bulk interval , respectively .",
    "finally , let us clarify the role of the @xmath72 operator on the right hand side .",
    "the bulk equations ( [ eq - v ] ) allow for a factorizable solution @xmath89 with @xmath90 eq .",

    "equations ( [ eq - v ] ) and ( [ junction ] ) , with the substitution @xmath93 and @xmath94 , provide the complete eigenvalue problem to determine the eigenmasses and the bulk profiles of the scalar modes of the system .",
    "it is clear from the form of the equations that this problem is well posed , and can be uniquely solved .",
    "we discuss this in detail in section [ eigen - problem ] , and provide an explicit example in section [ soft ] .",
    "one can obtain a simpler set of boundary conditions than ( [ junction ] ) in the limit of infinitely stiff brane potentials .",
    "let us taylor expand the brane potential for small fluctuations @xmath47 around the background values @xmath95 : @xmath96 where the potential and its derivatives on the right hand side",
    "are evaluated at the background solution @xmath95 . as can be seen from ( [ bou - bck - ein ] ) and ( [ bou - bck - phi ] ) , only the expectation values of the brane potential @xmath19 and its first derivatives @xmath97 are relevant at the background level .",
    "the brane `` masses '' @xmath98 only enter in the boundary conditions for the linear perturbations ; higher - order terms in ( [ taylor - u ] ) are instead relevant only beyond the linearized level , and can be disregarded in our study .",
    "the stiff potential limit is the limit for which the `` masses '' @xmath99 are much greater than any other mass scale in the problem . in the original goldberger - wise @xcite stabilization mechanism , this is the limit of large @xmath100 ; it is also explicitly noted there , that the equations considerably simplify in this limit .",
    "this limit can always be imposed by simply adding a quadratic potential term @xmath101 centered on the background solution , and then taking the limit of large @xmath102 .",
    "adding this term does not modify the background solution .",
    "the simplification occurs because in this limit @xmath103 at the brane location ; this can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ jun2 ] ) .",
    "more precisely the fluctuations @xmath47 on the brane `` adjust themselves '' to the @xmath104 level required to satisfy ( [ jun2 ] ) .",
    "we actually do not need the explicit solutions for the scalar fluctuations . if we consider the equations in the original set of variables @xmath105 we see that the boundary conditions ( [ jun2 ] ) are the only terms in which the second derivatives @xmath106 are present .",
    "these equations can be solved for sufficiently small @xmath107 , but then , once they are satisfied , the only role that these equations play in the stiff limit is to impose that @xmath107 at the boundary can be set to zero in all the other equations of the system .",

    "an object of large mass @xmath8 acquires an infinitesimally small , @xmath108 , velocity in the scattering . for @xmath109",
    "we simply disregard the motion of the heavy object , and the value of @xmath8 drops from the problem ; the role of the heavy object is to ensure that the momentum conservation equation is satisfied , but then this momentum conservation equation plays no role in the dynamics of the light mass(es ) participating in the scattering .",

    "( [ v - bc - stiff ] ) provides a system of @xmath112 independent boundary conditions in the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the reason why the number is @xmath112 ( rather than @xmath0 ) is because the overall normalization of a mode - which is proportional to @xmath111 - can not be specified by the linearized problem we are solving ( if one multiplies the solutions of a linear system by a common factor , one still has a solution ) . fortunately , we do not need to know @xmath111 if we are only interested in solving the linearized problem for the eigenmasses of the modes , and therefore we can simply set @xmath111 to any convenient nonvanishing value ( see section  [ eigen - problem ] ) .   in eqs .",

    "one can typically start by fixing a provisory ( and , generally , incorrect ) normalization ; for instance , one can require that one of the wave functions evaluates to @xmath168 at one boundary .",
    "this , together with the @xmath121 conditions coming from the two boundaries , allows the system of linearized equations to be completely solved . in this way",
    ", one obtains the masses of the physical modes , and the wavefunctions , up to an overall , yet to be specified , normalization .",
    "we stress that the overall normalization of the solutions is an irrelevant quantity in a linearized system of equations ( if we rescale all the modes of a solution by a common factor , we still have a solution ) .",

    "still , the overall normalization is crucial to determine the couplings of the perturbations , ( since the couplings are determined by the values of the wavefunctions ) ; subsection [ kin - action ] explains how to rescale the solutions , so as to obtain the correct normalization , once the linearized system has been solved .",
    "in many cases , the bulk equations can not be solved analytically ; we expect this to be the norm in the scalar sector , where the perturbations are coupled in the equations ( this happens even if the bulk potential is a sum of separate terms , due to the mixing of the scalar field perturbations with the metric perturbations ) . in this case",
    ", the eigenvalue problem needs to be solved with a shooting method ; one fixes half of the @xmath167 parameters that are necessary to determine the bulk evolution , by enforcing the @xmath0 conditions at one of the two boundaries .",
    "next one guesses the remaining @xmath0 parameters , and solves the bulk equations which enable the wave functions to be evaluated on the other boundary .",
    "if the resulting solutions happen to satisfy the boundary conditions also there , then one has obtained a physical mode of the system . typically , the initial guess is not correct , and one needs to employ some numerical scheme to obtain the solutions .",
    "for example , one can compute by how much the wavefunctions evaluated at the second brane differ from the expected boundary conditions , as a function of the initial guesses .",
    "an @xmath0-dimensional newton s method can then be implemented to find the zeros of this function .",
    "we perform this algorithm in the example studied in the next section .",
    "the tensor sector is significantly simpler than the scalar sector .",
    "the wave functions @xmath169 , defined in equation ( [ deco - tensor ] ) , satisfy the second order differential equation ( [ sch - tensor ] ) in the bulk .",
    "each solution is in principle characterized by three parameters : the mass @xmath166 of the eigenmode , and two integration constants @xmath170 . however , as for the scalar case , only the ratio of these two constants , and not the overall normalization of the solution , can be determined from the linearized problem .",
    "therefore to just obtain the eigenmasses and bulk profiles we can simply fix an arbitrary normalization by requiring that @xmath156 acquires a nonzero ( but arbitrary ) value at a given position ( typically , at one boundary brane ) .",
    "this gives one condition .",
    "the other two conditions are enforced by the boundary branes ( each brane enforces one condition , given by the last expression in ( [ dpdm ] ) ) , or if a brane is absent , by the requirement that the wavefunction is normalizable .",
    "these three conditions then allow @xmath171 and @xmath172 to be determined with the bulk profiles known up to an overall normalization",
    ". the correct normalization can be then obtained from the quadratic action of the tensor modes , analogously to what we dicussed for the scalar sector .",

    "as an example , we studied the system of perturbations in the soft - wall model of @xcite , which is characterized by two bulk scalar fields .",
    "we found the scalar perturbations in this model behave identically to those of the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism @xcite ; namely , there is tower of kk modes with mass at the ir scale , and a lighter radion mode , whose mass is suppressed with respect to the kk tower by a large logarithm ; all these modes are peaked at ir values of the bulk coordinate .",
