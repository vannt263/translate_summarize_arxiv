    "a central dominant galaxy ( cd galaxy ) is frequently found at the center of a galaxy cluster .",
    "previous imaging x - ray observations revealed that x - ray emission from intra - cluster medium ( icm ; e.g. sarazin 1988 ) often exhibits strongly peaked brightness , which coincide with cd galaxies ( e.g. jones & forman 1984 ) . such clusters can be classified as xd clusters ( jones & forman 1984 ) or cd clusters .",
    "this phenomenon has generally been interpreted in terms of a temperature gradient in the icm , particularly due to cooling flows ( cf ; see fabian 1994 for a review ) occurring at the densest part of the icm where the radiative cooling time is considerably shorter than the hubble time . due to limited spectroscopic capabilities of pre-_rosat _ instruments ,",
    "however , the radial temperature profiles of the icm were usually estimated indirectly from the observed x - ray brightness profiles , assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm within a plausible shape of the gravitational potential ( i.e. deprojection method ; fabian et al .",
    "1981 ) . results of such calculations indicate that the icm temperature often decreases towards the center , typically down to @xmath5 kev .",
    "the existence of such a cool component was spectroscopically confirmed with the _ einstein _ sss and fpcs ( canizares et al .",
    "1979 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "1981 ; lea et al .",
    "1982 ; white et al . 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , excess absorption was observed with the _ einstein _ sss from central regions of a number of cd clusters ( white et al .",
    "1991 ; johnstone et al .",
    "1992 ) . with the advent of _ rosat",
    "_ ( trmper 1984 ) , the temperature gradient decreasing towards the cluster center have been detected in many cd clusters ( e.g. allen et al . 1993 ) .    in reality",
    ", the icm temperature structure is thought to be quite multi - phased , in such a way that there exist many temperatures and densities at a given radius ( e.g. inhomogeneous cooling flows ; nulsen 1986 ) .",
    "actually , such a multi - phase structure was suggested in the central region of the virgo cluster , through fine - resolution spectroscopy with the _ einstein _ fpcs ( canizares et al .",
    "nevertheless , single - phase approximations , in which a single temperature is assigned to each radius , have been used extensively as an approximation .",
    "this description has successfully explained the observed data , at least in energy bands below 3  kev , yielding results consistent with those from a multi - phase modeling ( thomas , fabian , & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "however , the single - phase approximation may no longer be valid in higher energy ranges , and may fail to reveal some important aspects of cd clusters .",
    "another key issue related to the central regions of clusters is spatial distribution of the icm metallicity , which directly reflects the evolutionary history of the cluster and its member galaxies .",
    "koyama , takano , & tawara ( 1991 ) , through scanning observations of the virgo cluster with the _ ginga observatory _ , showed that the iron abundance of the icm clearly increases towards its cd galaxy , m87 .",
    "white et al . ( 1994 ) , utilizing the different sizes of fields of view of the _ einstein _ sss and the _ ginga _ lac , revealed the central metal concentration in a496 , a2142 , and possibly in a1795 and a2199 .",
    "however , metallicity gradients in other clusters remained unknown or inconclusive ( e.g. for the perseus cluster ; mushotzky et al .",
    "1981 ; ponman et al .",
    "1990 ; kowalski et al . 1993",
    "; arnaud et al .",
    "this issue was rather hard to explore even with _",
    "rosat _ , because of the limited spectral resolution and the limited energy band ( 0.12.4 kev ) that does not cover the fe - k line energy ( 67 kev ) .",
    "the _ asca observatory _",
    "( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) , with its superior imaging spectroscopic capability up to 10 kev , has drastically improved our knowledge on the issues of temperature structure and metallicity distribution in icm . among many clusters",
    "so far observed with _ asca _ , the centaurus cluster ( cen cluster for short ) is of particular interest : it exhibits both the metallicity concentration and the central cool emission in a most outstanding manner , as already reported by ohashi et al .",

    "the phenomena are so fascinating that they deserve a still more detailed investigation .",
    "we have hence re - analyzed the previously and the newly obtained _ asca _ data of the cen cluster , together with those from the _ rosat _ pspc having a better angular resolution .",
    "for the _ asca _ data analysis , we have taken fully into account the complex response of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "1995 ; tsusaka et al . 1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1995 ) on board _ asca _ using the method described in ikebe et al .",
    "we have reconfirmed the conclusion made by fea94 , that the icm in the central region of the cen cluster is made up of hot and cool phases , and investigated their detailed characteristics . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review past x - ray results on the cen cluster , and point out relevant scientific issues .",
    "section 3 gives a brief description of the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ observations .",
    "results of the new analysis are presented in sections 4 through 6 , followed by discussion in section 7 .",
    "we assume @xmath6 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 throughout .",
    "the cen cluster , or a3526 , is a relatively poor cluster of galaxies ( e.g. dickens , currie , & lucey 1986 ) at a redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "it is one of the nearest and the most well studied abell clusters . at the cluster center , there exists a cd galaxy ngc  4696 .",
    "the cen cluster has been observed repeatedly in x - rays , with _ uhuru _",
    "( giacconi et al . 1972 ; forman et al . 1978 ) , _",
    "( mitchell & mushotzky 1980 ) , the _ einstein observatory _ ( matilsky , jones , & forman 1985 ; david et al . 1993 ) , _ exosat _ ( edge & stewart 1991 ) , and _ ginga _ ( yamashita 1992 ) .",
    "these observations indicate the 210 kev luminosity of @xmath8 erg s@xmath4 , and the icm temperature of @xmath9 kev except in the central region .",
    "a central excess brightness , interpreted as a cf , was detected within @xmath10 of the center ( matilsky et al .",
    "1985 ; edge & stewart 1991 ) .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1994 ; hereafter af94 ) analyzed the radius - sorted _ rosat _ pspc spectra of the cen cluster , and found that the projected icm temperature significantly decreases within @xmath11 of the cluster center , where they also found some evidence for increased metallicity or excess absorption .",
    "a single - phase deprojection solution derived by af94 implies that the icm temperature starts decreasing from @xmath12 kev at a radius of @xmath11 , roughly as @xmath13 as a function of the three - dimensional radius @xmath14 , reaching @xmath5 kev at the cluster center .",
    "they derived a mass deposition rate of 3040 @xmath15 yr@xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , the cen cluster was observed with _ asca_. the _ asca _ spectra within a central @xmath16 region can not be fit with a single temperature model , requiring at least two temperatures of @xmath17  kev and @xmath5  kev ( ohashi et al . 1994 ; fea94 ; ikebe 1995 ) .",
    "fabt94 analyzed the spectrum from the central region of the cen cluster obtained in the same observation , and spectroscopically estimated the mass deposition rate to be 1520 @xmath15 yr@xmath4 in terms of homogeneous - cf approximation .",
    "thus , the available x - ray data consistently indicate presence of the cool region at the center of the cen cluster .",
    "the _ asca _ data also revealed a drastic metallicity increase towards the center ( ohashi et al 1994 ; fea94 ; ikebe 1995 ) .",
    "this occurs within @xmath16 of the cd galaxy ngc  4696 and spatially coincides with the appearance of the cooler component .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data of the virgo cluster also show qualitatively similar temperature and metallicity profiles ( matsumoto et al . 1996 ) .    based on these new results , fea94 ,",
    "makishima ( 1994 ) , and ikebe ( 1995 ) developed a two - phased modeling of the icm , wherein a cool component is confined within @xmath18 of the center , immersed in a hot component that fills the entire cluster volume .",
    "this view is apparently supported by the fact that the two temperatures , @xmath17  kev and @xmath19  kev , are quite constant as a function of the projected radius from the center ( fea94 ; ikebe 1995 ) .",
    "however , an x - ray spectrum involving many temperature components , such as is implied by a single - phased icm after projection , or by inhomogeneous cfs , may well be approximated with just two model temperatures ( fabt94 ) .",
    "in addition , the apparent existence of the hot emission at the cluster center might be an artifact caused by the complex responses of the xrt on board _",
    "asca_. in short , the true three - dimensional temperature structure of the icm in the central region of this cluster is still unknown .",
    "the cen cluster was observed twice with _ asca _ , in 1993 and 1995 .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] , and the pointing positions are shown in figure  [ fig : images]a .",
    "the 1993 observation took place during the pv ( performance verification ) phase . because the x - ray emission from the cen cluster extends beyond edge of the @xmath20-radius field of view of the _ asca _ gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ; makishima et al .",
    "1996a ) , three separate pointings were made ; one right on the cluster center , and the others with @xmath21 offset from the cluster center .",
    "these data were already used by fea94 , fabt94 and ikebe ( 1995 ) .",
    "the 1995 observation was performed in the ao-3 period , by pointing on the cluster center for about 59 ksec .    in these observations ,",
    "the two gis detectors , gis2 and gis3 , were operated in the normal ph mode ( ohashi et al .",
    "the two detectors of the sis ( solid state imaging spectrometer ) instrument , sis0 and sis1 , were operated in 4ccd bright mode during the 1993 observation , while in 1ccd faint mode during the 1995 observation . in the following data analysis , we use the gis data (  4 ,  5 and  6 ) , as well as a limited portion of the sis data (  5 ) .",
    "we discarded the gis and sis data that were taken when the xrt view direction was within @xmath22 of the local horizon .",
    "this is to avoid the periods when the target is earth occulted , and to exclude the effect of solar x - rays scattered off the atmosphere .",
    "additional screening that the elevation angle from the sunlit earth is greater than @xmath23 and @xmath24 was applied to the sis0 and sis1 data , respectively . in order to ensure a low and stable particle background",
    ", we also discarded the gis and sis data acquired under geomagnetic cutoff rigidity smaller than 6 gev c@xmath4 .",
    "the background is composed of cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and non x - ray background ( nxb ) .",
    "the cxb component was derived from the data of blank - sky observations performed in 1993 and 1994 .",
    "we estimated the nxb component by using the data taken when the xrt is pointing at the dark ( night ) earth .",
    "detailed description of the _ asca _ background properties , and the method of background subtraction , are found in kubo et al .",

    "( 1995 ) , ueda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and ishisaki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    by analyzing the _ asca _ data taken in 1995",
    ", we found that the x - ray peak position is systematically displaced by @xmath25 from that measured in 1993 .",
    "this is most probably due to inaccuracy in the satellite attitude determination ( see gotthelf 1996 ) . in order to eliminate the discrepancy",
    ", we have adjusted the individual photon positions of the 1995 data so that the peak positions obtained in the two epochs become coincident .",
    "this does not affect our results , since we do not discuss absolute alignment x - ray features relative to the optical position , and we are mostly concerned with angular scales larger than @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : images]b shows the 0.710 kev gis image of the cen cluster obtained in this way .",
    "data from the two gis detectors are combined , and events from the four partially - overlapping pointings ( obtained in 1993 and 1995 ) are synthesized into a single image after correction for exposure and for the systematic attitude difference mentioned above . the background was subtracted but the image is not corrected for the xrt vignetting . the emission from the cluster is thus detectable up to the boundary of the gis field of view , exhibiting an approximate circular symmetry around the cd galaxy , which coincides with the x - ray peak .    although the gis has sensitivity in the 0.710  kev range ( ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ) , its response below @xmath27  kev is still subject to some uncertainties arising from complex xenon m - edge structures .",
    "this sometimes causes a noticeable discrepancy between the gis and sis spectra around 1  kev .",
    "furthermore the actual gis image of cygnus x-1 , which is needed in the image analysis with the gis data , is blurred in soft energies by interstellar grain scattering . as a consequence",
    ", the gis image analysis becomes less reliable below @xmath28 kev . throughout this paper",
    ", we hence discard the gis data below 1.6  kev .      in order to complement the limited angular resolution of _ asca",
    "_ , we also utilize the _ rosat _ all sky survey data and those from pointing observations with the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "rosat _ all sky survey observations over the cen cluster were performed in january 1991 with an average exposure time of 290 sec .",
    "the x - ray emission from the cen cluster was detected up to at least @xmath29 ( @xmath301.6  mpc ) from the center .",
    "pointings onto the cen cluster were also performed later with the pspc .",
    "our analysis of the _ rosat _ surface brightness distribution utilizes the all sky survey data , because the x - ray size of the cen cluster significantly exceeds the pspc field of view .",
    "the all sky survey data provide a virtually flat exposure over the whole cluster , and the point - spread function is averaged out to become nearly position independent .",
    "these properties of the all sky survey data make the analysis relatively simple .",
    "in contrast , for the spectral analysis (   5 ) that requires good photon statistics , we use the 7.5 ksec pspc pointing data taken on 1992 february 2 right on the cluster center .",
    "previous x - ray imaging observatories were sensitive only to soft x - rays below @xmath304  kev .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to investigate x - ray brightness distributions in broader energy bands using the _ asca _ data .",
    "accordingly , we here analyze the radial count - rate profiles obtained with the _ asca _ gis , in comparison with that from the _ rosat _ pspc . for the reason described later in  4.2",
    ", we do not analyze the sis data in this section .      by azimuthally averaging the data around the x - ray centroid , we have derived the gis radial x - ray count - rate profiles .",
    "the data from the two gis detectors ( gis2 and gis3 ) obtained in the 4 pointings were all summed up .",
    "figure  [ fig : gisrpro]a shows the background - subtracted gis profiles thus derived in 5 different energy bands , 1.62.4 , 2.44.5 , 4.56.0 , 6.07.1 , and 7.110.0  kev .",
    "the lowest energy band is sensitive to the cool component , while the fourth band covers the fe - k energy region .    to assist the gis data analysis",
    ", we also derived a radial count - rate profile of the _ rosat _ all sky survey data , from which we eliminated contaminating point sources .",
    "we used the pi channels from 52 to 201 , roughly corresponding to an energy range of 0.52.0  kev .",
    "figure  [ fig : pspcrpro ] shows the derived pspc count - rate profile , which includes the background .",
    "thus , we have altogether six radial profiles , one from _ rosat _ and five from _",
    "asca_.      in order to quantify the derived radial count - rate profiles , we fit them in a `` forward '' manner .",
    "that is , we represent the three - dimensional emissivity distribution of the icm by a spherically - symmetric numerical model involving a small number of adjustable parameters .",
    "the model emissivity is convolved with the image - response matrix ( irm : ikebe et al .",
    "1997 ) that represents the vignetting effects and the position- and energy - dependent point - spread function ( psf ) of the telescope plus detector system , and then with the energy response matrices of the focal plane instruments .",
    "the obtained model prediction , to which the expected background is added , is directly fitted to the observed count - rate profiles .",
    "we search for the best - fit model , through minimization of the @xmath31 function defined in ikebe et al .",
    "this approach allows us to fully take into account the known instrumental responses , and provides a particularly powerful analysis method of the _ asca _ data that are subject to the very complex psf .",
    "however , we must carefully choose the initial model in order to obtain meaningful results .",
    "the psf of the _ asca _ xrt+gis can be constructed using the actual images of cygnus x-1 ( takahashi et al .",
    "1995 ; ikebe 1995 ; markevitch et al .",
    "1996 ) . when fitting the _ asca _ gis profiles , we apply 2% systematic errors to the model prediction , and 10% systematic errors to the background intensity .",
    "however , cygnus x-1 is too bright to be observed with the sis .",
    "consequently the present analysis method is not applicable to the sis data , and hence we do not analyze the sis data in this section . as to the psf for the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( xrt+pspc ) data , we use the one calculated at 1.0  kev and averaged over the whole pspc field of view ( hasinger et al .",
    "the energy dependency of the psf is small , and negligible in the following analysis .",
    "the irm used here has a size of 102 in the sky - region dimension , both for the gis and the pspc .",
    "the 102 regions comprise 16 shell regions of @xmath32 width covering a spherical region within @xmath33 , where @xmath14 is three - dimensional radius from the center , and 86 shell regions of @xmath26 width covering @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we implicitly assume that no x - ray emission comes from outside the maximum radius of @xmath35 as is justified by the _",
    "rosat _ pspc image .      as the three - dimensional emissivity model",
    ", we first try a single-@xmath1 profile defined as @xmath36^{-3\\beta}~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is again the three - dimensional radius , @xmath37 is the core radius , and @xmath1 is the beta - parameter .",
    "the energy spectrum is assumed to be that of thermal x - ray emission from an isothermal plasma of temperature 4.0 kev with a constant metallicity of 0.3 solar , modified by galactic absorption of @xmath38 = 8.8 @xmath39 @xmath40 ( stark et al .",
    "although this assumption is inconsistent with the significant spectral changes seen from the cen cluster , its effect is negligible in the present analysis because we here _ individually _ treat count - rate profiles integrated over relatively narrow energy bands .",
    "we thus fitted the pspc profile over a range of @xmath41 with the single-@xmath1 model plus a constant background , where @xmath42 denotes the projected radius .",
    "as presented in table  [ tab : rprofit ] and figure  [ fig : pspcrpro]a , the fit was unacceptable , because of the long - known central excess emission ( matilsky et al .",
    "1985 ; af94 ) . by limiting the fit range to @xmath43 where the icm is virtually isothermal ( af94 ; fea94 ) ,",
    "the fit has become acceptable ( table  [ tab : rprofit ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : pspcrpro]b ) with the best - fit model revealing the strong central excess above it .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters ( table  [ tab : rprofit ] ) are close to those ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) derived previously by matilsky et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who used the 0.53.5  kev _ einstein _ ipc data over a narrower range of @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , we fitted the gis radial count - rate profiles with the single-@xmath1 model over @xmath47 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : rprofit ] and figure  [ fig : gisrpro]b .",
    "thus , the single-@xmath1 model failed to reproduce the gis profiles in the lower four energy bands .",
    "the failure is thought to be caused by the central excess emission , because the fit residuals behave qualitatively in the same manner as those in the unacceptable single-@xmath1 fit to the pspc profile using the entire radius range .",
    "we hence conclude that the strong central - excess emission of the cen cluster , previously known in x - ray energies below @xmath17 kev , is present in harder energy ranges at least up to 7.1 kev , although the excess may be rather energy dependent .",
    "the gis radial profile in the highest energy band ( 7.110  kev ) was fitted apparently well with a single-@xmath1 model . however , the obtained @xmath1 model is unusually flat with @xmath48 , and is inconsistent with that derived with the pspc profile outside @xmath10 ( @xmath49 ; table  [ tab : rprofit ] ) . if the 7.110  kev brightness profile in the outer cluster region were really flatter than that in 0.52  kev , the icm temperature would rise significantly towards outside , e.g. , from 3  kev at @xmath50 to 5  kev at @xmath51 , and 7  kev at @xmath52 ; this disagrees with the previous observational results ( af94 ; fea94 ) .",
    "such an unusually flat solution often occurs when we force a single-@xmath1 model to fit an x - ray radial profile having a strong central excess ( makishima 1995 ) .",
    "we hence infer that the central excess emissivity is present even in the highest gis energy band .",
    "this inference is supported by the fact that the single-@xmath1 solution in 7.110 kev has nearly the same shape as those unacceptable models which approximate the 2.44.5 , 4.56.0 , and 6.07.1 kev profiles , as can be seen in table  [ tab : rprofit ] .",
    "if the data statistics were somewhat better , the single-@xmath1 fit to the 7.110 kev gis profile would have been rejected as well .",
    "a further confirmation of these results is presented below .      to better quantify the count - rate profiles , we proceed to use a double @xmath1-model given as @xmath53^{-3\\beta_1 }    + \\epsilon_{0,2 }      \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm c,2 } }",
    "\\right)^2 \\right]^{-3\\beta_2}~~.\\ ] ] here @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are model parameters ; the term with suffix 1 ( wider @xmath1-component ) represents the overall cluster emission , while that with suffix 2 ( narrower @xmath1-component ) represents the central excess emission .",
    "this model has been applied successfully to the _ asca _ gis data of the fornax cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ) , the hydra - a cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1997 ) , abell 1795 ( xu et al . 1998 ) , and ngc  4636 ( matsushita et al .",
    "furthermore , mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ) used the same model to quantify the _ rosat _ pspc count - rate profiles of several galaxy groups .",
    "like in the previous subsection , the model is assumed to have the energy spectrum for the isothermal plasma of 4.0  kev temperature and 0.3  solar metal abundance . the core radius and beta value of the wider @xmath1-component , are fixed at @xmath56=@xmath60 and @xmath58=0.57 , respectively , as obtained with the @xmath61 pspc profile , while the other 4 parameters are left free .",
    "this procedure is justifiable , because the observed near - isothermality of the icm emission for @xmath62 requires the outer - region emissivity profile to be independent of x - ray energy , although the amplitude of the central excess may be rather energy dependent .",
    "furthermore in our final analysis made in ",
    "6 , we let @xmath56 and @xmath58 to vary freely .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab : rprofit ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : pspcrpro]c and [ fig : gisrpro]c , this double-@xmath1 model has given acceptable fits to most of the gis and pspc count - rate profiles , possibly except in the 1.62.4  kev band .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath57 and @xmath59 are roughly energy independent within rather large errors .",
    "in contrast , as shown in figure  [ fig : rce ] , we observe a significant energy dependence in relative strength of the central excess emission , or `` relative central excess '' ; this has been calculated in each gis or pspc energy band by integrating the flux implied by the narrower @xmath1-component and normalizing it to that carried by the wider @xmath1-component , both calculated within a sphere of @xmath63 .    from these results",
    ", we conclude that the central excess emission of the cen cluster results from a combination of three apparently separate effects .",
    "the first is the presence of the spectral cool component ( fea94 ; fabt94 ) , which causes the prominent increase in the relative central excess below @xmath17 kev .",
    "the second effect is the metallicity increase towards the center , which makes the relative central excess significantly higher in the fe - k energy band than in the adjacent energy ranges .",
    "the somewhat worse fit in the 6.07.1 kev band is probably due to an additional effect from the metallicity gradient .",
    "the last effect is the intrinsic shape of the gravitational potential , which is inferred since the central excess does not vanish in figure  [ fig : rce ] even in the highest energy band , where the former two effects are expected to be negligible .",
    "now that the three - dimensional emissivity distribution , @xmath64 , has been determined in the pspc energy band and in the five gis energy bands in terms of the double-@xmath1 model , we can calculate a `` deprojected '' 6-bin x - ray spectrum at any radius @xmath14 .",
    "this is possible because the best - fit double-@xmath1 model has been determined in each energy band including proper normalization , and the relative normalization between the pspc and the gis is known to an accuracy of @xmath3010% . in figure",
    "[ fig : deprojected ] , we show the deprojected spectrum in the central spherical region of @xmath65 ( 27 kpc )",
    ". for comparison , theoretically predicted x - ray spectra from thermal plasmas are illustrated in the same figure .",
    "thus , the deprojected spectrum at the cluster center does not agree with any of the single - temperature model predictions . above energies of @xmath17",
    "kev the spectrum is as hard as the @xmath66  kev model , while the data in lower energy bands require contributions from much cooler ( e.g. @xmath671  kev ) plasmas .",
    "since the projection effects have already been removed , we should conclude that the icm in the central @xmath68 region can not be isothermal : the cluster center volume must be filled with the hot icm , where",
    "there co - exists the cooler plasma .",
    "this nicely reconfirms the two - phased modeling adopted by fea94 and ikebe ( 1995 ) , who already found the hot - phase temperature of @xmath69  kev and the cool - phase temperature of @xmath70  kev .",
    "in contrast , the wide - band gis data are inconsistent with the _ rosat _ deprojection results ( af94 ) in which the spectrum at the cluster center is approximated by a single - phase emission with @xmath71  kev .",
    "evidently , this discrepancy arises because the _ rosat _ pspc works only below @xmath72  kev .    at this stage",
    ", we arrive at the following two important specifications for the forward - method modeling of the cen cluster icm : the double-@xmath1 model to represent spatial properties , and the two - phase picture to express spectroscopic properties .",
    "however , we have so far neglected the strong metallicity concentration which was discovered previously ( fea94 ) ; this will be taken into account in ",
    "in   4 we have studies the spatial properties of the x - ray emission , and obtained significantly new findings as to the central region of the centaurus cluster .",
    "however we did not fully utilize the spectral information there . accordingly in this section , we perform a detailed spectroscopic study of the central region by jointly analyzing spectra from the pspc , the sis , and the gis .",
    "we accumulated energy spectra from the pspc , gis , and sis , over the central region of @xmath73 radius .",
    "the energy ranges covered by the pspc , gis and sis are 0.22.0  kev , 1.610  kev , and 0.510  kev , respectively .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data used here were taken in a pointing observation in 1992 , and the _ asca _ data refer to the 1995 observation .",
    "the pspc background was estimated from the same observation in the annular region of @xmath74 from the x - ray peak .",
    "the data from the two gis detectors were combined together , as were those from the two sis detectors .",
    "the gis and sis backgrounds were produced as described in ",
    "3 , utilizing the blank sky observations and the night earth data .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra thus derived are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .    in the previous works by af92 ,",
    "fea94 , and fabt94 , individual spectra from different detectors were fitted separately .",
    "in contrast , we fit the three spectra simultaneously , using the xspec package ( ver . 10.0 ) .",
    "this allows us to perform the highest - quality spectroscopy of the icm in the central region of this important cluster .",
    "however to obtain reliable results under rather high data statistics , we need to consider in advance several technical issues , which are described in the next subsection .",
    "as a thermal plasma emission code , we use the mewe - kaastra model ( mewe , gronenschild & van den oord 1985 ; mewe , lemen , & van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ) modified by liedahl , osterheld & goldstein ( 1995 ) , which is implemented in xspec as mekal model .",
    "we use the fiducial solar abundances ( relative to hydrogen in number ) given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ; he=0.0977 , c=3.63@xmath75 @xmath76 , n=1.12 @xmath75 @xmath76 , o=8.51@xmath75 @xmath76 , ne=1.23 @xmath75 @xmath76 , mg=3.80@xmath75 @xmath77 , si=3.55 @xmath75 @xmath77 , s=1.62@xmath75 @xmath77 , ar=3.63 @xmath75 @xmath78 , ca=2.29@xmath75 @xmath78 , fe=4.68 @xmath75 @xmath77 , and ni=1.78@xmath75 @xmath78 . the abundances of si , s , ar , ca , and fe are left free , while that of ni is tied to that of fe .",
    "other elements are assumed to have the solar abundances .",
    "we should here remember a serious problem of the theoretical fe - l line modeling , as pointed out by several authors including fabt94 and arimoto et al .",
    "according to kaastra ( 1997 ) , even the improved mekal model has significant uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we assign 20% systematic errors to each spectral data point in the 0.41.6  kev range , as has been employed successfully by matsushita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in analyzing the _ asca _ spectra of the x - ray luminous elliptical galaxy ngc  4636 .",
    "we employ photoelectric absorption model due to the wisconsin cross section ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , which is implemented in xspec as wabs model .",
    "we fix the redshift for the pspc data to the optical value of 0.0104 , while we leave free those for the gis and sis data in order to compensate any possible slight mismatch in their detector gains .",
    "the relative normalizations among the three detectors are also left free .",
    "the _ asca _ spectra for extended sources are generally subject to significant flux mixing among different sky regions due to the widely extended psf of the xrt .",
    "however the spectra accumulated over the central @xmath73 of the cen cluster are contaminated by no more than 20% by photons from the sky regions outside , since the brightness profile is so peaked at the center .",
    "furthermore , both the vignetting and the xrt psf can be considered as virtually constant across the @xmath73-radius region .",
    "based on these considerations , we calculate the effective area of the _ asca _ xrt by assuming that a point source located at the x - ray peak is being observed .    finally , a residual uncertainty in the sis low energy efficiency is known to cause a systematic over estimate of the absorption column density ( dotani et al .",
    "1996 ; cappi et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore , only for fitting the sis spectrum",
    ", we artificially apply an additional absorption to spectral models by an equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath79 @xmath40 .      as already shown in   4 and in the previous works , the icm in the central region of the cen cluster can not be isothermal , but is more likely to consist of two components having different temperatures . accordingly",
    ", we fit the pspc , sis and gis spectra jointly with a two - temperature thermal emission model modified by photo - electric absorption . the metal abundance for each element",
    "is assumed to be common to the two components , and the two components are assumed to suffer the common absorption which is left free .",
    "other specifications of the fitting refer to  5.2 .",
    "then , the fitting model can be expressed as wabs*(mekal+mekal ) in xspec , to which we shall refer as model  1 .",
    "this model  1 has given an acceptable simultaneous fit , as shown in table  [ tab : specfit ] and figure  [ fig : specfit]a .",
    "however , a noticeable feature remains both in the sis and gis residuals at @xmath80  kev ( figure  [ fig : specfit]a ) .",
    "similar residuals have been noticed in the _ asca _ spectra of the perseus and virgo clusters ( fukazawa 1997 ) , and may still be caused by the uncertainty in the fe - l complex modeling .",
    "therefore we have modified model  1 by adding one artificial narrow gaussian line at @xmath80  kev , and refer to it as model  2 , which is expressed as wabs*(mekal+mekal+line ) .",
    "model  2 has given a satisfactory fit ( table  [ tab : specfit ] ; figure  [ fig : specfit]b ) with the line having a center at 1.74  kev and an equivalent width of 18  ev .",
    "the obtained absorption column density is consistent with the galactic value ( 8.8 @xmath39 @xmath40 ; stark et al .",
    "the redshifts for the sis and gis become 0.007 and 0.018 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the optical value of 0.0104 , because the sis and gis have systematic gain uncertainties of @xmath81% .",
    "the best - fit metal - abundances that are common to the two components are si=1.6 ( @xmath82 ) , s=1.7 ( @xmath82 ) , ar=2.0 ( @xmath83 ) , ca=2.0 ( @xmath84 ) , and fe = ni=1.00 ( @xmath85 ) in the solar unit .",
    "the si and fe abundance ratio , si / fe@xmath301.6 , is consistent with that of some other clusters having the similar icm temperature of @xmath304  kev ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; fukazawa et al . 1998 ) . when the abundance for each component was left free individually , the fe ( = ni ) abundances of the cool and the hot component were obtained to be 0.8 ( @xmath86 ) and 1.00 ( @xmath87 ) solar , respectively . all the other metal abundances were poorly constrained in this case , but at least have consistent values between the two components .",
    "previously , fabt94 reported that the two temperature model in which the cooler component has an significant excess absorption gives the best description to the sis spectrum of the cen cluster .",
    "however this could be caused by the systematic error in the sis low - energy response (  5.2 ) , which was not clearly known when fabt94 analyzed the data . in order to investigate this issue",
    ", we applied an additional absorption to the cool component .",
    "the model is expressed as wabs*(wabs*mekal+mekal+line ) , and referred to as model  3 .",
    "the fit with model  3 ( figure  [ fig : specfit]c ) reduced the minimum @xmath31 by only 1 from that with model  2 , and the excess absorption remained rather unconstrained ; it is not statistically significant but can be as high as @xmath88 @xmath40 at the cluster rest frame ( 90% upper limit ) .",
    "therefore , the current datasets do not require an excess absorption for the cool component .      in order to investigate other possible spectral models ,",
    "we replaced the cool component with a cooling flow model without and with the excess absorption ; they are respectively expressed as wabs*(mkcflow+mekal+line ) , referred to as model  4 , and wabs*(wabs*mkcflow+mekal+line ) , referred to as model  5 . here",
    "mkcflow is the cooling flow model by mushotzky & szymkowiak ( 1988 ) , employing the mekal model as a plasma emission code , in which the temperature is continuously distributed from the maximum temperature @xmath89 to the minimum temperature @xmath90 with emissivity inversely proportional to the cooling function at each temperature .",
    "we fix @xmath90 at 0.2  kev , while we tie @xmath89 to the hot component temperature .",
    "the fit results are summarized in table  [ tab : specfit ] and figure  [ fig : specfit]d , e .",
    "thus , neither model  4 nor model  5 gave acceptable fits , with significantly larger values of @xmath31 than has been obtained with the two - temperature models .",
    "the most prominent discrepancy with the model  4 is seen below 1  kev ( figure  [ fig : specfit]d ) .",
    "the discrepancy is somewhat relaxed with the model  5 ( figure  [ fig : specfit]d ) , but it requires no galactic absorption . therefore the emission is unlikely to have such a multi - temperature structure as is predicted by the cooling flow hypothesis .",
    "judging from the most advanced observational information thus obtained through the simultaneous fits to the pspc , sis , and gis spectra , the icm in the central region of the cen cluster can be regarded as consisting of the two distinct temperature components of @xmath301  kev and @xmath304  kev .",
    "this reconfirms the main conclusion obtained previously by fea94 , and justifies us to employ the two - temperature model rather than the cooling flow model .",
    "in order to unify the spatial results obtained in  4 and the spectral results derived in  5 , in this section we quantify the overall icm properties through a full forward - method analysis , considering simultaneously the spectroscopic and spatial dimensions .",
    "we start from a thee - dimensional model cluster , which takes into account three important ingredients ; the two - phase temperature structure , the double-@xmath1 brightness distribution , and the central metallicity increase .",
    "we use the 1.610 kev gis data and the 0.52.0 kev pspc data .",
    "although we do not use the sis data explicitly for the reason described in  4.2 , the analysis takes into account the spectral results obtained in   5 for which the sis data have significant contributions .",
    "we have sorted all the available gis data of the cen cluster into 10 spectra covering ten concentric annular regions , with outer boundaries at projected radii of @xmath26 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : wagirispec ] . using predictions derived from a common model cluster , we attempt to fit jointly these 10 spectra as well as the @xmath41 pspc radial profile ( figure  [ fig : pspcrpro ] ) .",
    "the fitting method is essentially the same as described in   4 , except that the gis data mainly constrain the spectroscopic properties while the pspc data strongly constrain the spatial properties .",
    "according to the two - phase ( two - temperature ) modeling established in  5 , we express the emissivity profile in a given energy range ( @xmath100 to @xmath101 ) as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the emission measure profile , @xmath104 is the cooling function , and suffices c and h denote the cool and hot phases , respectively .",
    "following  4.4 , we represent the emission measure profile of the hot phase , @xmath105 , by a double-@xmath1 model as @xmath106^{-3\\beta_1 }   + n_{0,2}^2 \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm c,2 } } \\right)^2 \\right]^{-3\\beta_2}~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are model normalizations , having a dimension of plasma density , to be utilized in place of @xmath54 and @xmath55 of equation ( [ eq:2beta ] ) , respectively . for the cooling function @xmath104",
    ", we employ mekal model as has been used in the previous section .",
    "the hot - phase temperature @xmath109 is assumed to be spatially constant , but left free to vary .",

    "we assume @xmath110 to be common to the two @xmath1-components of equation ( [ eq : em2beta ] ) .    as to the cool phase , we model its radial emission measure profile , @xmath115 , with a single-@xmath1 model involving three free parameters , as @xmath116^{-3\\beta_{\\rm c}}~~.\\ ] ] the cool - phase spectrum , @xmath117 ,",
    "is assumed to be spatially constant , with @xmath118 and @xmath119 being the temperature and metallicity , respectively .",
    "we also introduce a cut - off radius , @xmath120 , beyond which there no longer exists the cool phase . from the _ rosat _ results ( af94 ) , we fix @xmath121 .",
    "the cluster model introduced here involves many free parameters .",
    "the hot component involves at least 10 free parameters , @xmath109 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath122 .",
    "if the abundance ratios among the different elements are allowed to vary , the number of free parameters becomes still larger .",
    "for the cool component there are at least 5 parameters , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , and even more if allowing variable abundance ratios .",
    "in addition , we leave free the relative normalization between the pspc and the gis , as well as the pspc background which is assumed to be radius independent .",
    "thus , the number of model free parameters becomes at least 17 .      in actually fitting the 10 gis spectra and one pspc radial profile simultaneously with the cluster model described in  6.1 , it is not practical to leave all the parameters free .",
    "accordingly , we fix the chemical composition of the hot phase to obey the abundance ratios obtained with model  2 in   5.3 , and model the iron abundance profile with equation ( [ eq : metallicity ] ) , so that abundances of all the other heavy elements vary with @xmath14 in proportion to that of iron .",
    "this leaves the hot phase with 10 free parameters .",
    "we also fix the temperature and various abundances of the cool phase ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) , and the hydrogen column density , all to the values derived with model  2 in   5.3 .",
    "this also allows us to best utilize the sis information , which is not incorporated directly here .",
    "consequently , we have three free parameters specifying the cool component , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . adding the relative pspc / gis normalization and the pspc background , the number of free parameters becomes 15 .    by changing the 15 parameters and minimizing the chi - square",
    ", we search for the model which gives acceptable simultaneous fits to the 10 ring - sorted gis spectra plus the pspc radial profile .",
    "then , as shown in figure  [ fig:2phasefit ] , an acceptable best - fit model has been obtained with @xmath126 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : ringspecfit ] , and the model emission measures of the hot and cool components and the hot - component iron - abundance profile are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2phasefitmodel ] .",
    "the obtained hot - component temperature of @xmath127  kev is somewhat lower than the value derived from the central @xmath73 region ( table  [ tab : specfit ] ) , possibly indicating a global outward temperature decrease in the hot component as has been observed in many clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "however the difference is only 10% , so that we can safely regard the hot phase as being approximately isothermal .",
    "the wider - component parameters , @xmath128 @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 , are close to those derived in  4.3 using the @xmath132 _ rosat _ data . as shown in table  [ tab : ringspecfit ] , the narrower - component parameters are poorly constrained . to assess the relative spatial scales between the two @xmath1 components",
    ", we again performed the fit , forcing the narrower - component @xmath1 value , @xmath59 , to be equal to that of the wider - component , @xmath58 .",
    "the derived core radii are @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the wider and narrower @xmath1 components , respectively , with the common @xmath1 of 0.59 and the relative normalizations of @xmath107:@xmath108:@xmath135=1:3.9:16.4 , yielding a chi - square of @xmath136 .",
    "this agrees with the results in the double-@xmath1 fits ( table  [ tab : rprofit ] ) . also",
    "the values of @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 are not much different from those found previously ( e.g. fea94 ; ikebe 1995 ) .",
    "as to the cool - phase emission measure profile , @xmath115 , the best - fit solution yields @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 .",
    "therefore @xmath115 is inferred to have a slightly smaller core radius than the narrower @xmath1-component describing @xmath105 . in other words ,",
    "the cool emission is somewhat more concentrated to the cluster center than the hard - band central excess emission .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the two - phase model has been accepted by the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data .",
    "furthermore , the obtained parameters of the two - phase model are generally consistent with those obtained previously by fea94 , af94 , and ikebe ( 1995 ) .      in order to better illustrate the two - phase solution obtained in   6.2 , we introduce the volume filling factor @xmath144 of the cool phase .",
    "we assume , after fea94 and ikebe ( 1995 ) , that a local pressure balance is achieved between the two phases , i.e. , @xmath145 and the emission measure of the two phases can be expressed as @xmath146 here @xmath147 and @xmath148 are densities of the hot and cool phase , respectively , and @xmath144 is the volume filling factor of the cool phase .",
    "these two equations yield @xmath149 we may then substitute the best - fit double-@xmath1 model into @xmath150 , and the best - fit single-@xmath1 model into @xmath115 , to obtain @xmath144 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fillpro ] . within @xmath151 kpc ,",
    "the average filling factor of the cool phase becomes 68% .",
    "we may now substitute @xmath144 back into equation ( [ eq : emdens ] ) , and convert the emission measure distributions into radial density distributions of the hot and cool components , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "the calculated icm density distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : denspro ] .",
    "we can further calculate the mass profiles of the cool and hot icm components as @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively , where @xmath156 is the mean molecular weight which is set to be 0.6 , and @xmath157 is the proton mass . we show the calculated icm mass distributions in figure  [ fig : masspro]a , together with the spherically integrated stellar mass distribution derived assuming the mass - to - light ratio of 8 from the optical brightness data of schombert ( 1987 ) and dickens et al .",
    "the integrated iron mass profiles in the cool and hot phase were also calculated and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : masspro]b .",
    "using the best - fit two - phase model , we also calculated the radial profile of the total gravitating mass , @xmath158 , as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the icm pressure , @xmath161 is the mass density of icm , and @xmath162 is the constant of gravity .",
    "this equation is based on the standard formula for an isothermal icm in hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath160 is given as @xmath160 = @xmath163 = @xmath164 ( @xmath165 is the boltzmann constant ) , while the gas mass density @xmath166 can be expressed as @xmath167    the calculated @xmath168 is shown in figure  [ fig : masspro]c .",
    "there , we also present dark - matter distribution , @xmath169 , derived by subtracting the icm mass and the stellar mass from @xmath170 .",
    "@xmath170 agrees quite well with the result by af94 , except in the central region where the two - phases are coexisting .",
    "figure  [ fig : masspro]d gives the @xmath14-dependence of the baryon fraction , i.e. the stellar mass plus icm mass normalized to the total mass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : masspro]c , both @xmath168 and @xmath171 exhibit a shoulder - like feature at @xmath172 kpc .",
    "this feature arises through the following two effects .",
    "one is that the emissivity profile requires two @xmath1 components even in the high energy range , as shown in   4.4 and   6.2",
    "therefore , the gravitational potential must exhibit an additional drop within @xmath173 kpc , in order to confine the excess icm .",
    "the other is that the central excess in @xmath152 ( the gas density of the hot component , hence pressure ) is in fact still more prominent than that seen in @xmath174 or @xmath105 , because of the @xmath175 factor in equation ( [ eq : emdens ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the central excess is expected to be less prominent in the hard - band emissivity ( or emission measure ) than in the hot - phase pressure , because the hot phase is partly displaced by the cool phase near the cluster center .",
    "a further discussion is given in ",
    "we have analyzed the most advanced x - ray data of the centaurus cluster obtained with the _ rosat _ pspc , the _ asca _ gis , and the _ asca _ sis . in   4 , we showed that the radial count - rate profiles in several broad energy bands obtained with the gis and the pspc are described adequately with the double-@xmath1 models ( figure  [ fig : pspcrpro]c & [ fig : gisrpro]c , table  [ tab : rprofit ] ) .",
    "this means that the central excess brightness within @xmath176 that has been known in soft x - rays is present over the entire _ asca _ energy range up to 10  kev , although the excess fraction is lower in higher energies ( figure  [ fig : rce ] ) .",
    "the `` deprojected '' six - band spectrum at the center ( figure  [ fig : deprojected ] ) is clearly non - isothermal , indicating a multi - phase property .",
    "this implies that the single - phase approximation that was often used to describe soft x - ray results on clusters is no longer valid at least for the cen cluster .    in  5",
    ", we jointly analyzed the x - ray energy spectra taken with the pspc , gis , and sis , and showed that the two - temperature ( @xmath27  kev and @xmath177  kev ) thermal - emission model modified by the galactic absorption gives the best description of the spectra , reconfirming the main conclusion of the previous work by fea94 .",
    "the spectra did not require significant excess absorption to the cool component . the cooling flow model , either with or without the excess absorption , did not give acceptable fits to the spectra .    combining the spatial and spectral properties derived respectively in  4 and  5 , we have obtained in  6 the overall icm model by simultaneously fitting the ring - sorted gis spectra and the pspc radial profile .",
    "the best - fit solution indicates that , within @xmath11 ( @xmath178 kpc ) of the cd galaxy ngc  4696 , the icm can be regarded as an unresolved mixture of two disjoint phases ; a hot phase with @xmath69 kev of which the emission measure profile can be expressed by a double-@xmath1 model with core radii @xmath30175  kpc and @xmath3043  kpc , and a cool phase with @xmath70 kev of which the emission measure profile is described by a single-@xmath1 model having a small core radius of @xmath3010  kpc . the dramatic metallicity increase near the center , first revealed by fea94 , has also been confirmed .",
    "we summarize the characteristics of the two phases in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "these results consistently indicate that the central region within @xmath179 ( 50 kpc ) of the cen cluster is a site of three characteristic phenomena .",
    "one is the hard x - ray excess emissivity , revealed in   4.3 and reconfirmed in   6.2 .",
    "another is the co - existence of the hot and cool phases , with the cool - phase filling factor behaving as shown in figure  [ fig : fillpro ] .",
    "the other is the high metallicity in both phases , as shown in   5.3 and figure  [ fig:2phasefitmodel ] .",
    "the two - phase modeling of the cen cluster icm has yielded the integrated mass distributions as shown in figure  [ fig : masspro]c (  6.4 ) . at @xmath172 kpc ,",
    "the total mass curve exhibits a characteristic bending feature .",
    "although details of this feature may depend on the icm modeling , the deviation from a king - type profile is a robust result , because it directly results from the central hard x - ray excess above the single-@xmath1 model (   4.3 ) . in other words ,",
    "the potential profile of the centaurus cluster becomes deeper at the center than a king - type one that has a flat core , and this deepening causes the central excess brightness in hard x - rays . in soft x - rays ,",
    "the central excess emission is enhanced by the cool phase .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : masspro]d , this central mass excess is significantly contributed by the stellar mass in the cd galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , even after subtracting the stellar mass contribution , the dark matter profile ( figure  [ fig : masspro]c ) still appears to show an inflection point at @xmath172 kpc as the total mass profile .",
    "therefore , the dark matter distribution itself is inferred to deviate from a king - type profile .",
    "such a central excess in the dark - matter distribution has been observed in the fornax cluster ( makishima 1995 ; ikebe 1995 ; ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ) , abell 1795 ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) , the elliptical galaxy ngc  4636 ( matsushita et al .",
    "1998 ) , and several galaxy groups ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) .",
    "these dark matter profiles have been interpreted as representing a galaxy / cluster hierarchy ; the dark matter is clustering on two separate spatial scales corresponding to the central galaxy and the entire cluster .",
    "the effect is above all evident in the fornax cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ) , since the x - ray peak associated with the cd galaxy , ngc  1399 , is offset by 4050 kpc from the center of the cluster emission .",
    "furthermore in ngc  4636 , the presence of two separate spatial scales has been confirmed in a model independent manner by matsushita et al .",
    "then , the dark matter in the cen cluster may also show such a dual distribution .",
    "alternatively , this dual structure may be an artifact caused by our particular modeling using two @xmath1-models , and the dark matter may distributes on a single spatial scale with a central cusp .",
    "in fact , such a cuspy distribution of dark matter , called _ universal density profile _",
    ", has been proposed by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996,1997 : hereafter nfw model ) based on @xmath180-body simulations .",
    "the nfw model describes the dark - matter density profile as @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the critical density that is a constant , @xmath183 is a characteristic density , and @xmath184 is a scale radius . its integral form becomes ( suto , sasaki , & makino 1999 ) @xmath185 when an isothermal icm is hydrostatically confined in the gravitational potential corresponding to equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) or equation ( [ eq : nfw_mass ] ) , the gas density profile is expressed as ( makino , suto , & sasaki 1998 ) @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are parameters related to the central icm density and the icm temperature , respectively .",
    "actually , tamura ( 1998 ) has shown that the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data of the abell 1060 cluster can be explained by a nearly isothermal icm confined in the nfw - type potential ( possibly with an even steeper cusp ) .    in order to examine the interpretation in terms of the nfw model",
    ", we again perform a simultaneous fitting to the pspc and gis data , with an alternative two - phase icm model . in   6 we modeled the two emission - measure profiles , @xmath105 and @xmath115 , and then simulated the data . here",
    "we take a somewhat different approach ; while we model @xmath115 again in terms of a single-@xmath1 model via equation ( [ eq : em1beta ] ) as before , we specify the total mass profile instead of @xmath105 . specifically , we express the total mass profile as a sum of the stellar mass profile @xmath189 , and the nfw dark - matter profile @xmath190 given by equation ( [ eq : nfw_mass ] ) .",
    "this is because the nfw model neglects the baryonic contribution .",
    "we fix @xmath189 according to figure  [ fig : masspro]a , while we treat @xmath183 and @xmath184 in equation ( [ eq : nfw_mass ] ) as fitting parameters .",
    "we further assume , as in   6 , that the hot phase is isothermal , the cool and hot phases are in pressure balance , and the cool component is distributed up to @xmath10 from the center .",
    "then , in the outer region of @xmath62 where the cool phase and the stellar mass are both negligible , the hot - phase density profile @xmath147 can be given analytically by equation ( [ eq : nfw_icm ] ) .",
    "in contrast , within @xmath191 where @xmath147 is affected by the cool phase and the stellar mass , we must numerically solve the ordinary differential equation for @xmath147 as @xmath192 once @xmath115 , @xmath193 , and @xmath171 are specified .",
    "this relation refers to equation([eq : grav ] ) , into which equations ( [ eq : pbal ] ) through ( [ eq : meanrho ] ) have been substituted .    with this alternative icm model ,",
    "we have fitted the gis spectra and the pspc profile simultaneously as was performed in ",
    "the hot phase temperature was left free to vary , while the hot - phase metallicity profile was again modeled with equation ( [ eq : metallicity ] ) .",
    "the cool - phase temperature and the cool - phase metallicity were fixed to the values derived with model  2 in   5.3 ; so was the overall hydrogen column density .",
    "this has given an acceptable fit to the gis / pspc data , with a reduced chi - square of @xmath194=400/408 ( to be compared with @xmath195 derived in ",
    "6.2 using the double-@xmath1 modeling ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : nfwking ] and the model profiles are illustrated in figure  [ fig : nfwmodel ] .",
    "although we treated both the scale radius ( @xmath196 ) and the characteristic density ( @xmath197 ) as free parameters , the nfw model indicates that they are correlated in such a way that central densities are higher in lower mass systems ( navvaro , frenk , & white 1996 ) . in order to examine the nfw - model fit result for the mass - density relation",
    ", we calculated the virial mass , @xmath198 , which is the total mass within the sphere encompassing a mean overdensity of 200 .",
    "the derived virial mass is @xmath199 @xmath15 for @xmath200 = 50 , or @xmath201",
    "@xmath15 for @xmath200 = 75 , which agree with the mass - density ( @xmath202 ) relations derived with scdm ( @xmath203=1 , @xmath200=50 ) or cdm@xmath104 ( @xmath203=0.25 , @xmath200=75 ) cosmological models , respectively ( for detail see navvaro , frenk , & white 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the dark - matter density profile of the cen cluster is concluded to be consistent with the nfw model .    for comparison , we also tried a king - type profile for the dark matter distribution , instead of the nfw profile . in this case",
    ", we substitute into equation ( [ eq : nfw_diffeq ] ) @xmath204 where the hot component temperature @xmath109 , the core radius @xmath205 , and @xmath206 are free parameters . in the outer cluster region where the temperature structure becomes isothermal and the stellar mass contribution is negligible , the icm density profile is expressed with a @xmath1-profile as @xmath207 instead of equation ( [ eq : nfw_icm ] ) .",
    "the fit with the king - type profile yielded a minimum chi - square value of @xmath194=428/408 ( table  [ tab : nfwking ] ) , which is significantly worse than that with the nfw mass model .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : nfwmodel]a , the best - fit king - type profile is less massive than the nfw profile in the central region .",
    "these results confirm that the dark matter mass profile in the cen cluster indeed deviates from a king - type one , exhibiting a significant central excess .",
    "in other words , the central excess in the total mass distribution , which we have discovered , can not be attributed entirely to the contribution of stellar mass in the cd galaxy .",
    "the excess dark matter can be reproduced with the single nfw profile ; then , the double-@xmath1 modeling we used in   4 and",
    "  6 may be regarded as a conventional one rather than a physical one .",
    "of course , there still remains the alternative possibility that the dark - matter distribution in the central region in fact has two distinct spatial scales , like in the fornax cluster ; in that case , the double-@xmath1 modeling has a physical meaning . in short , the central excess in the total mass profile",
    "consists of a baryonic component and a dark component .",
    "the latter , in turn , is either a dark halo associated with ngc  4696 , or a central cusp in the cluster - scale dark matter distribution . with the current datasets alone , we can not distinguish these two alternatives .      our results indicate that the central volume of the cen cluster is permeated by the hot - phase icm , where a small amount of cool phase is mixed up . the cool phase , having an average filling factor of 68% within 60  kpc , presumably takes the form of blobs or filaments immersed in the hot phase on angular scales too small to be resolved with _",
    "asca_. indeed ,",
    "the _ rosat _ hri observations of some cd clusters have revealed evidence of small - scale ( a few kiloparsec ) x - ray inhomogeneities ( sarazin , oconnell , & mcnamara 1992ab ; prestwitch et al .",
    "then , what is the nature of the cool phase ?",
    "the failure of the cooling - flow model (   5.4 ) inspires us to explore an alternative interpretation .",
    "first of all , the cool phase has a temperature of @xmath208 kev , and a core radius of @xmath209 kpc centered on the cd galaxy .",
    "these values are similar to , or slightly higher ( larger ) than , those of inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of ordinary elliptical galaxies ( e.g. forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; awaki et al . 1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "it is hence suggested that the cool phase has a close connection to the ism of the cd galaxy ( fea94 ; makishima 1994 , 1996b , 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath118 is comparable to the virial temperature of the central dimple in the gravitational potential .    employing the two - phase picture together with equations ( [ eq : pbal ] ) and ( [ eq : emdens ] ) , and assuming the cool - phase abundance of 1.0 solar , the total emission integral and total mass of the cool phase are calculated to be @xmath210 @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "( note that the cool - phase mass derived in fea94 , @xmath213 , was subject to a trivial mistake . )",
    "these values are comparable to those of the ism associated with the most luminous non - cd elliptical galaxies ( forman et al . 1985",
    "; matsushita 1997 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the cool phase of the cen cluster lies on a smooth extension of the temperature vs. emission - integral relation or temperature vs. gas - mass relation seen among non - cd elliptical galaxies ( matsumoto et al . 1997",
    "; matsushita 1997 ) .",
    "the ratio of the cool - phase mass to the stellar mass of ngc  4696 is @xmath214% , which is also comparable to those of non - cd elliptical galaxies ( forman et al .",
    "therefore , the cool phase may be regarded essentially as the ism of the cd galaxy .    in comparison with the ism of the most x - ray luminous non - cd ellipticals , which is thought to have a filling factor of @xmath215 , the cool phase of the cen cluster may have a similar gas mass and a similar spatial extent with @xmath216 on average .",
    "then , we expect the cool phase of the cen cluster to be @xmath217 times more luminous than the ism of non - cd ellipticals . actually , the 0.54 kev luminosity of the cool phase of the cen cluster , @xmath218 erg s@xmath4 , is some 10 times higher than those of the most x - ray luminous ordinary elliptical galaxies ( e.g. forman et al .",
    "1985 ) , in good agreement with the above prediction .    in   5.3 ,",
    "we have determined the iron abundance of the cool phase to be @xmath219 solar .",
    "this should be compared with ism metallicity of non - cd elliptical galaxies . through observations with _",
    "( forman et al . 1993 ) , _ bbxrt _ ( serlemitsos et al . 1993 ) , and _ asca _ ( awaki et al . 1994 ; loewenstein et al . 1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , the ism of elliptical galaxies were found to be extremely metal poor .",
    "this was a serious theoretical problem , because the measured ism abundances , often below half a solar , fall even below those implied by the contribution from stellar mass loss , leaving essentially no room for the supernova contribution ( arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , the detailed recent work by matsushita ( 1997 ) and matsushita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) clearly indicates that the most x - ray luminous ellipticals have the ism abundances of 0.71.0 solar , in agreement with those from the stellar mass - loss .",
    "then , the cool - phase metal - abundance of the cen cluster that we measured is close to , or only slightly higher than , those of the most x - ray luminous non - cd ellipticals .",
    "thus , from every aspect including the temperature , angular extent , mass , and metallicity , the cool phase of the cen cluster can be regarded as the ism associated with the cd galaxy , ngc  4696 , which is among the most luminous ellipticals .",
    "the only basic difference is that the ism of ngc  4696 is confined not only by the central potential drop but also by external pressure from the surrounding hot phase to achieve the considerably low filling factor , hence the higher density and the higher luminosity , than those of ordinary ellipticals .      although the increased metallicity in the cool phase has been explained successfully in   7.3 using analogy to the ism of ordinary ellipticals",
    ", we must also explain the iron concentration seen in the hot phase .",
    "indeed , the metallicity increase in the central part of the hot phase is even more robust than the abundance enrichment in the cool phase , because the former can be directly evidenced by the central increase in the fe - k line equivalent width .",
    "such an effect is not limited to the cen cluster , because cd clusters generally exhibit statistically significant metallicity increases at the center ( fukazawa 1997 ) .",
    "obviously , the metals in the icm must have been supplied by individual stars in the member galaxies , as clearly demonstrated by the large - scale abundance gradient found by ezawa et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the awm7 cluster .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the spatial distribution of the iron mass and the optical light profile is crucial . in figure",
    "[ fig : imlr ] , we plot iron - mass to light ratio ( imlr ; ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) , i.e. ratio of the total iron mass ( contained in both icm phases ) within each radius to the total optical luminosity within the same radius , expressed in solar units .",
    "the plot clearly reveals an outward increase in the imlr , until it reaches @xmath220 ( at @xmath221 kpc ) which is a typical imlr found in clusters of galaxies ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; arnaud et al .",
    "1991 ; tsuru 1992 ; renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; renzini 1997 ) . in other words ,",
    "the iron is more widely spread than the stars contrary to the impression we get from the measured steep metal profile , while the iron is more concentrated than the icm mass profile as evidenced by the strong central metallicity enhancement . actually , another two - phase model , in which the constant imlr is assumed rather than equation  ( [ eq : metallicity ] ) is adopted , gave a significantly worse fit to the gis+pspc data with @xmath194=464/407 , because it predicts the iron concentration much stronger than is observed .",
    "note that this argument utilizes only the observed quantities , and unaffected by uncertainties in the supernova rate or its time evolution .",
    "reisenegger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued that the central metallicity increase , produced by the cd galaxy , may be reduced by the cooling flow , because the metal - rich plasma is swept inwards and then disappears .",
    "however , the value of @xmath222 ( table  [ tab : ringspecfit ] ) we have obtained is significantly larger than the scale length of the metallicity increase , @xmath223 , calculated by reisenegger et al .",
    "( note that the instrumental effects have already been removed from @xmath122 . ) furthermore , the prediction by reisenegger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , that the cf rate should negatively correlate with the metal concentration scaled to the stellar mass of the cd galaxy , has not been confirmed in a sample of poor clusters observed with _ asca _",
    "( tamura et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the outward increase in imlr need to be explained by some mechanism other than the cf : there are the following two possible mechanisms",
    ".    first , the supernova ejecta may be so energetic that they may not be confined by the gravitational potential of ngc  4696 .",
    "as a supporting evidence , we refer to a large number of imlr measurements in clusters , groups , and elliptical galaxies ( ciotti et al . 1991",
    "; arnaud et al .",
    "1991 ; tsuru 1992 ; renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; renzini 1997 ; matsushita 1997 ) . for clusters having the x - ray temperature higher than @xmath301  kev ,",
    "the imlr integrated over the whole system is remarkably constant at @xmath224 . on the contrary ,",
    "the imlr of systems that have temperature less than @xmath301  kev is significantly lower on average , and scatters widely .",
    "as the above authors argue , these results indicate that the metal - rich gas escapes significantly from smaller systems , such as groups and single elliptical galaxies , because their gravitational potential is not deep enough .",
    "then , a considerable fraction of the supernova products in ngc  4696 may well have escaped from its gravitational potential in the form of winds , to spread over the cluster space .",
    "in addition , motion of the cd galaxy can also contribute to the metal spread - out .",
    "although ngc  4696 now seems to sit at the bottom of the cluster potential , it may have been moving through the cluster space and gradually became stationary over its lifetime .",
    "then , the metal - enriched supernova products may have been continually spilling over the galaxy potential , or stripped off the host galaxy by ram pressure exerted from the icm , to be left over in the surrounding icm as the galaxy moves away .",
    "actually , the position of a cd galaxy , which generally coincides with the x - ray peak position , is often displaced from the centroid of the large scale x - ray emission ( e.g. ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ; neumann & bhringer 1995 ; lazzati & chincarini 1998 ) .",
    "offsets are seen also between the radial velocities of the central galaxies and the average velocities of the member galaxies ( e.g. beers & geller 1983 ; zabludoff , huchra , & geller 1990 ; zabludoff et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this suggests that the central galaxy is in an harmonic oscillation mode within the central potential minimum ( lazzati & chincarini 1998 ) , or that the central potential structure itself is still evolving with time .    from these considerations",
    ", we can interpret that the excess iron in the central region of the cen cluster was actually produced by the cd galaxy over the hubble time , and transported to a wider cluster space .",
    "we have so far argued that the cool phase is essentially the ism associated with the cd galaxy .",
    "however , our two - phase solution implies the central plasma densities of @xmath225 and @xmath226 @xmath211 , hence radiative cooling times of @xmath27 gyr and @xmath227 yr , for the hot and cool phases respectively ( both assuming 1 solar abundance ) .",
    "thus , the cool phase would be subject to a strong radiative cooling ; the stable presence of such a plasma component must be explained .    before attempting to solve this problem ,",
    "let us consider ism of non - cd elliptical galaxies .",
    "in many elliptical galaxies , the ism has been observed to be hotter than the stellar kinetic temperature by up to a factor of @xmath72 ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ; matsushita 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of some ubiquitous ism heating mechanism is indicated .",
    "this tendency becomes more prominent in x - ray fainter ellipticals ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , presumably because the heat input is less diluted and the ism cooling effect becomes less important in the x - ray fainter galaxies , which have smaller amount of ism . at the same time , the measured ism metal abundances clearly decrease towards x - ray fainter ellipticals ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ; matsushita 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the supernova heating can not be the main mechanism of the ism heating .",
    "we presume that the ism is heated by random stallar motion in each galaxy , through amplification of interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "the fields will in turn reconnect to heat up the ism , in particular near the magnetopause of each star .",
    "quantitatively , the random stellar motion in giant elliptical galaxies has a total kinetic energy of @xmath228 ergs .",
    "if a few tens percent of this energy is spent in the ism heating over the hubble time , we can expect a heating luminosity up to a few times @xmath229 ergs s@xmath4 , which is comparable to the observed x - ray luminosities of elliptical galaxies .",
    "as argued by kritsuk ( 1992 , 1996 , 1997 ) , this heating mechanism may balance the radiative cooling of the ism , and keep the ism in an apparent steady state .",
    "( microscopically , the ism may recycle between the cooling and heating stages . )",
    "this scenario is best supported by the observational fact that the ism emissivity is spatially proportional to the stellar light density ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ) , the latter being proportional to the local heat input .",
    "if we apply the same idea to the cool phase of the cen cluster , its high luminosity ( @xmath230 ergs s@xmath4 ) requires that nearly all the stellar kinetic energy of ngc  4696 has been released in the plasma heating . in other words",
    ", we must invoke a significant dynamical evolution of ngc  4696 .",
    "this is actually quite plausible , because ngc  4696 , being a cd galaxy , must have grown up via cannibalism .",
    "conversely , the merger process would not proceed without such energy dissipation , and the plasma heating is one of the most plausible dissipation mechanisms .",
    "suppose that the stellar mass of ngc  4696 has doubled to the present value by repeated mergers of dwarf galaxies over the hubble time",
    ". the total energy release will be @xmath231 ergs s@xmath4 if the infalling dwarf galaxies are assumed to have no dark - matter halos .",
    "when the dwarfs are thought to have mass - to - luminosity ratios similar to that of the present - day ngc  4696 , the energy release will be @xmath232 times larger .",
    "then , we expect an average heating luminosity in the range @xmath233 ergs s@xmath4 , which may be sufficient to sustain the cool - phase luminosity .",
    "finally , we must consider the spatial configuration of the cool and hot phases .",
    "if they were not thermally insulated from each other , the cool phase would be heated up and disappear quickly by conductive heat flux from the hot phase ( takahara , & takahara 1979 ) .",
    "therefore , the two phases must be thermally insulated from each other , presumably by magnetic fields .",
    "for example , the cool phase may fill up the interior of numerous magnetic loops anchored to the cd galaxy ( makishima 1997 ) , whereas the hot phase may permeate the open - field regions which connect to the outer cluster space .",
    "the heating process considered above in principle operates on both phases , but it must be much more effective on the cool phase due to the higher field strengths inside each magnetic loop and due to the closed magnetic configuration .",
    "any heating effect on the hot phase would be difficult to observe , because the heat deposit would be quickly transported to the outer region by the heat conduction within the hot phase , with a typical time scale of @xmath234 yr .    in summary , by invoking the merger process , magnetic reconnection , and a certain magnetic configuration , we can",
    "at least qualitatively give a self - consistent account of the two - phase nature observed in the central region of the cen cluster .",

    "<S> _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data of the centaurus cluster , holding a cd galaxy ngc  4696 , were analyzed , as a partial re - analysis after fukazawa et al . </S>",

    "<S> radial brightness profiles in different energy bands show that the central excess emission of this cluster , known previously in soft x - rays ( @xmath0 kev ) , is present also in the hard energy band up to 10  kev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the central excess emission can not be explained solely by a temperature drop together with a king - type potential having a flat core , and requires a deeper central potential . </S>",
    "<S> a double-@xmath1 brightness distribution gives a good account of the data . </S>",
    "<S> a deprojected energy spectrum within a spherical region of radius @xmath2 kpc at the cluster center indicates that the icm can not be isothermal there . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous fitting of the three ( pspc , gis , and sis ) energy spectra extracted from the central region within a projected radius of 3 arcmin showed that a two - temperature model that has temperatures of 1.4  kev and 4.4  kev and a common metallicity of 1.0 solar with the galactic absorption gives the best description to the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> a cooling - flow spectral model did not give satisfactory fit . </S>",
    "<S> these results reconfirm the two - phase picture developed by fukazawa et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1994 ) in which the hot icm fills nearly the entire cluster volume , wherein a small amount of cooler plasma is intermixed and localized near the cluster center . a 3-dimensional cluster model incorporating the two - phase picture , the double-@xmath1 brightness distribution , and the central metallicity increase reproduced the overall _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data successfully . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the dark matter that is derived by subtracting the stellar mass from the calculated total - gravitating mass deviates from a king - type profile and exhibits a central excess . </S>",
    "<S> another two - phase cluster model in which the dark - matter density profile is given with the _ universal density profile _ ( navvaro , frenk , & white 1996,1997 ) also gave a satisfactory account to the data . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison of the iron mass distribution with that of the stellar component reveals that the iron is more widely spread than stars , which may have been caused by energetic supernovae and the motion of the cd galaxy . since the derived characteristics of the cool phase including the temperature , angular extent , gas mass , and metallicity , are on a smooth extension of those of inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of elliptical galaxies , the cool phase can be regarded as the ism associated with the cd galaxy , while the high x - ray luminosity of the cool phase ( @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 in 0.54.0 kev ) is interpreted as a result of a compression by the surrounding hot phase </S>",
    "<S> the cool - phase x - ray emission is presumably sustained by energies dissipated by infalling mass to the cd galaxy in the course of cluster evolution . </S>"
