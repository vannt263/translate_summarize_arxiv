    "<S> how do conductance and fano factor now depend on the aspect ratio @xmath68 at @xmath57 ? on the one hand , the conductance starts from zero and increases linearly with @xmath68 for large aspect ratios , pointing towards a universal conductivity @xmath93 in the limit @xmath29 . on the other hand , </S>",

    "<S> however , the surprise comes if we now take finite values of @xmath67 and @xmath86 into account . </S>",
    "<S> in that situation , the dependence of conductance and fano factor on aspect ratio is crucially affected by the sign of @xmath65 . for @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> the conductance weakly increases and the fano factor weakly decreases with @xmath68 . for @xmath96 , in contrast , the conductance ( and fano factor ) are non - monotonic functions of @xmath68 , see , for instance , the pronounced maximum for the conductance ( and minimum for the fano factor ) at around @xmath97 in fig .  2 . due to the complexity of the underlying equations , we do not have a closed form of the position of the extremum . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can find an approximate result in the parameter regime @xmath98 with @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the distance between the leads at which the maximum in the conductance occurs is approximately given by @xmath100 ( see appendix for the derivation ) . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the non - monotonic behavior shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 does not depend much on the choice of boundary conditions ( pbc or apbc ) which makes us confident that it is rather robust and , thus , observable in real systems . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom line is that the predicted non - monotonicity is a unique signature of the inverted regime that makes it rather simple to distinguish it from the normal regime even on a qualitative level .    </S>",
    "<S> it becomes clear by looking at fig .  2 that the bulk transport can be of equal magnitude or even larger than the edge transport which is limited to a contribution of @xmath101 to the conductance and does not contribute to the fano factor at all ( because the edge current is noiseless ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our predictions are very important for the interpretation of future experiments certainly for noise measurements but also for conductance measurements of clean samples with a small band gap and a substantial aspect ratio . however , for samples used so far in experiments @xcite , the aspect ratios are in a range @xmath102 and , thus , our analysis shows that the corresponding bulk conductance is a very small fraction of the edge conductance @xmath103 in this case .     for the aspect ratio @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( dotted black lines ) , @xmath106 ( dashed blue lines ) and @xmath107 ( full green lines ) with the choice of parameters @xmath69 , @xmath72 , and @xmath70 . the figure and the inset </S>",
    "<S> are done for pbc . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding data points for apbc look similar . ]    finally , in fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to the fermi energy dependence of transport . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for certain aspect ratios , the conductance @xmath58 shows a distinct minimum for small fermi energies @xmath108 ( close to @xmath109 ) in the inverted regime ( @xmath110 ) while it behaves qualitatively different for the normal regime ( @xmath111 ) and the massless limit ( @xmath78 ) . compare the solid , the dashed , and the dotted lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> similar to the aspect ratio dependence , the topologically non - trivial insulator can be characterized by a non - monotonic fermi energy dependence for small fermi energies close to the charge neutrality point . for larger fermi energies </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath58 increases in a step - like manner corresponding to the opening of new propagating modes . on top of the step - like behavior of the conductance </S>",
    "<S> , one can see very pronounced fabry - perot oscillations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in this ( large fermi energy ) regime </S>",
    "<S> , the different types of topological order behave rather similarly and it is difficult to distinguish them from each other . in the inset , we show the fano factor as a function of fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the shot noise has a poissonian character for small @xmath37 and @xmath112 while it behaves non - monotonically and has sub - poissonian character for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between the noise of the system in the normal regime and the noise of the system in the inverted regime should be easily seen in experiments and is one of the key results of our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath59 corresponds to the minimum of @xmath58 . for larger fermi energy , </S>",
    "<S> the fano factor has an oscillating character corresponding to the fabry - perot oscillations in the conductance .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the ballistic transport in bulk hgte quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the bulk conductance complements the edge - state transport and will be important for the interpretation of future experiments in clean samples . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted dependence of the bulk shot noise should be directly observable because the edge current is noiseless . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that both the conductance and the noise behave qualitatively different depending on whether the quantum well is in the normal or the inverted regime . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a new opportunity to experimentally verify the topological order of 2d topological insulators on the basis of ballistic transport measurements .    </S>",
