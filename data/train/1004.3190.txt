    "ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos ( uhec@xmath0 ) are expected to be produced in association with the observed ultrahigh energy ( charged ) cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , either at the same sites responsible for uhecr acceleration , or via interaction of the uhecr during propagation , particularly with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "these neutrinos are unique probes of new physics as their interactions are uncluttered by the strong and electromagnetic forces and , upon arrival at the earth , they may experience collisions with center - of - mass energies up to @xmath1  tev .",
    "however , rates for new physics processes are difficult to test since the flux of cosmic neutrinos is virtually unknown .",
    "interestingly , it is possible in principle to disentangle the unknown flux and new physics processes by using multiple observables  @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory provides a promising way to detect uhec@xmath0 by looking for deeply  developing , large zenith angle ( @xmath2 ) or `` quasi - horizontal '' air showers  @xcite . at these large angles ,",
    "hadron - induced showers traverse the equivalent of several times the depth of the vertical atmosphere and consequently their electromagnetic component is extinguished before reaching the detector .",
    "only very high energy muons survive past about 2 equivalent vertical atmospheres .",
    "therefore , the shape of a hadron - induced shower front is very flat and prompt in time .",
    "in contrast , a neutrino shower exhibits the roughly same morphology as a vertical shower .",
    "it is therefore possible to distinguish neutrino induced events from background hadronic showers .",
    "moreover , because of full flavor mixing , tau neutrinos are expected to be as abundant as other species in the cosmic flux .",
    "@xmath3 s can interact in the earth s crust , producing @xmath4 leptons which may decay above to the auger detectors ; such events will be referred to as `` earth  skimming '' events  @xcite .",
    "possible deviations of the neutrino ",
    "nucleon cross - section due to new non - perturbative interactions can be uncovered at the auger observatory by combining information from earth - skimming and quasi - horizontal showers .",
    "in particular , if an anomalously large rate is found for deeply developing quasi - horizontal showers , it may be ascribed either to an enhancement of the incoming neutrino flux , or an enhancement in the neutrino - nucleon cross - section ( assuming non - neutrino final states dominate )",
    ". however , these possibilities can be distinguished by comparing the rates of earth - skimming and quasi - horizontal events .",
    "for instance , an enhanced flux will increase both quasi - horizontal and earth - skimming event rates , whereas an enhanced interaction cross - section will also increase the former but _ suppress _ the latter , because the hadronic decay products can not escape the earth s crust .",
    "essentially this approach constitutes a straightforward counting experiment , as the detailed shower properties are not employed to search for the hypothesized new physics .    in this paper , we compute how many earth - skimming _ vs. _ quasi - horizontal showers one would have to collect at the auger observatory to convincingly demonstrate new non - perturbative physics in which the final state energy is dominated by the hadronic component .",
    "we show that even a small number of events could be sufficient to rule out the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus the expected low neutrino `` luminosity '' is not at all a show - stopper , and the observatory has the potential to uncover new physics at scales exceeding those accessible to the lhc .    in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we first compute acceptances for earth - skimming and quasi - horizontal events using detailed models of the terrain in the vicinity of the observatory as well as detailed simulations of the response of the surface array to highly inclined air showers .",
    "we then perform a likelihood analysis to determine the event counts needed to exclude the sm at various confidence levels .",
    "the analysis includes systematic effects both from theoretical uncertainties in the ( perturbative qcd ) sm cross - section  @xcite and from uncertainties associated with the detector response .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : new ] we discuss some possible new physics scenarios which could manifest themselves as non - perturbative interactions at lhc energies and beyond .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sims ] we describe the detailed monte carlo studies of the acceptance for earth - skimming and quasi - horizontal showers under the assumption of sm interactions , including systematic uncertainties .",

    "[ summary ]",
    "the analysis techniques described herein constitute an entirely general approach to searching for non - perturbative interactions in which the final state is dominated by hadrons , without any dependence on what hypothetical mechanism might actually cause the ` hadrophilia ' . in order to illustrate some possible new physics signals which may be accessible using these techniques",
    ", we consider below two interesting possibilities .      in @xmath5-dimensional scenarios with large - compact - extra - dimensions ( of common linear size @xmath6 )",
    "the planck scale is related to the fundamental scale of gravity ( @xmath7 ) according to  @xcite @xmath8 if @xmath9  gev , microscopic black holes ( bh ) can be produced _ gravitationally _ in particle collisions with center - of - mass energies @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "subsequently a tev - scale bh would promptly decay via thermal hawking radiation  @xcite into observable quanta  @xcite .",
    "( for @xmath11  tev , the lifetime of a bh of mass 10 tev is less than @xmath12  s. ) since gravitational coupling is flavor blind , a bh emits all the @xmath13 sm particle and anti - particle degrees of freedom with roughly equal probability .",
    "accounting for color and spin , we expect @xmath14 of the particles produced in bh evaporation to be quarks and gluons , @xmath15 charged leptons , @xmath16 photons or @xmath17 bosons , and @xmath16 neutrinos .",
    "thus , tev bh production and evaporation constitutes a clear example of beyond - sm non - perturbative physics .",
    "although such bh production cross - section @xmath18 is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the qcd cross - section @xmath19 , it was proposed @xcite that such bhs could be produced copiously at the lhc , and that these spectacular events could be easily filtered out of the qcd background .",
    "this is possible by triggering on bh events with prompt charged leptons and photons , each carrying hundreds of gev of energy .",
    "cosmic ray collisions , with center - of - mass energies ranging up to @xmath20  gev , certainly produce bhs if the lhc does .",
    "the question is , can they be detected ?",
    "most cosmic rays are protons or heavier nuclei , which collide with hadrons in the upper atmosphere , producing cascading showers which eventually reach the earth s surface . at energies of interest , however , the cosmic ray luminosity ( @xmath21  @xmath22 s@xmath23 , taking a single nucleon in the atmosphere as a target and integrating over @xmath24 sr ) , is about 50 orders of magnitude smaller than the lhc luminosity , thus making it futile to hunt for bhs in hadronic cosmic ray interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrino interaction lengths are far longer than the earth s atmospheric depth , although they would be greatly reduced by the cross - section for bh production  @xcite .",
    "cosmic neutrinos therefore could produce bhs with roughly equal probability at any point in the atmosphere . as a result",
    ", the light descendants of the bh may initiate low - altitude , quasi - horizontal showers at rates significantly higher than sm predictions .",
    "analytic and numerical studies have revealed that gravitational collapse takes place at high energies and small impact parameters  @xcite . in the course of collapse , a certain amount of energy is radiated in gravitational waves , leaving a fraction @xmath25 available for hawking evaporation . here",
    ", @xmath26 is a _ lower bound _ on the final mass of the bh and @xmath27 is the center - of - mass energy of the colliding particles , taken to be partons .",
    "this ratio depends on the impact parameter of the collision , as well as on the dimensionality of space - time .",
    "the inclusive production of bhs proceeds through different final states for different classical impact parameters @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "these final states are characterized by the fraction @xmath29 of the initial @xmath30 which is trapped within the horizon . here",
    ", @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the maximum impact parameter for collapse , where @xmath33^{\\frac{1}{d-3}}\\ ] ] is the radius of a @xmath5-dimensional schwarzschild bh  @xcite , and @xmath34 is the form factor  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 dependance complicates the parton model calculation , since the production of a bh of mass @xmath36 requires that @xmath37 be @xmath38 , thus requiring the lower cutoff on parton momentum fraction to be a function of impact parameter . because of the complexity of the final state , we assume that amplitude intereference effects can be ignored and we take the @xmath39 cross - section as an impact parameter - weighted average over partonic cross - sections , with the lower parton fractional momentum cutoff determined by @xmath40 .",
    "this gives a lower bound @xmath41 $ ] on the parton momentum fraction @xmath42 .",
    "all in all , the @xmath43 cross - section reads  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 labels parton species and the @xmath46 are parton distribution functions ( pdf ) .    as an illustration",
    ", we consider the @xmath47 string inspired scenario . for , @xmath11  tev , @xmath48 , and primary neutrino energy @xmath49  gev , we obtain @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude above sm predictions .",
    "the bh production cross - section by uhec@xmath0 scales as @xmath51^{\\frac{d-2}{d-3 } }   \\ ,   .\\ ] ] a further suppression arises if @xmath52 is increased . for parameters in the semiclassical regime ( @xmath53  @xcite )",
    "the bh cross - section becomes comparable to the sm cross - section at @xmath54  tev ; this determines the multidimensional planck scale to which auger may be sensitive .",
    "however , the lhc will also be sensitive to extra - dimensional effects at a similar scale .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether auger may have access to new physics _ beyond _ the reach of the lhc and",
    "we now discuss such a possibility .",
    "in the electroweak theory , non - trivial fluctuations in @xmath55 gauge fields generate an energy barrier interpolating between topologically distinct vacua  @xcite .",
    "an index theorem describing the fermion level crossings in the presence of these fluctuations reveals that neither baryon nor lepton number is conserved during the transition , but only the combination @xmath56 inclusion of the higgs field in the calculation modifies the original instanton configuration  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of this modification ( called the `` sphaleron '' ) is that it provides an explicit energy scale of about 10 tev for the height of the barrier .",
    "this barrier can be overcome through thermal transitions at high temperatures  @xcite , providing an important input to any calculation of cosmological baryogenesis .",
    "more speculatively , it has been suggested  @xcite that the topological transition could take place in two particle collisions at very high energy . the anomalous electroweak contribution to the partonic process",
    "can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , the tunneling suppression exponent @xmath59 is sometimes called the `` holy - grail function '' , and @xmath60  tev .",
    "thus , it is even possible that at or above the sphaleron energy the cross - section could be of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to cosmic ray physicists would be enhancement of the neutrino cross - section over the perturbative sm estimates , say by an order of magnitude in the energy range @xmath62 . with the methods outlined in this paper ,",
    "this can be detected as an anomalous ratio of quasi - horizontal earth - skimming showers to upcoming showers .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that for the simple sphaleron configuration @xmath63-wave unitarity is violated for @xmath64  tev . for lower parton subenergies ,",
    "the cross - section is exponentially damped to values well below the perturbative sm electroweak value  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , at the higher parton subenergies , the cross - section may well be dominated by non - spherically symmetric classical field configurations  @xcite .",
    "if for @xmath65 tev we saturate unitarity in each partial wave then this yields a geometric parton cross - section @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is some average size of the classical configuration . as a fiducial value we take the core size of the manton - klinkhamer sphaleron , @xmath68  cm . in this simplistic model , the @xmath39 cross - section is @xmath69 where @xmath70 . in the region",
    "@xmath71 the pdf for the up and down quarks is well approximated by @xmath72 , so the expression for the cross - section becomes @xmath73 where the last factor of 2/2 takes into account the ( mostly ) 2 contributing quarks @xmath74 in this range of @xmath75 and the condition that only the left - handed ones contribute to the scattering .",
    "this is about 80 times the sm cross - section  @xcite .",
    "of course this calculation is very approximate and thecross - section can easily be smaller by a factor of 10 ( e.g. , if @xmath67 is 1/3 of the fiducial value used ) .",

    "<S> the pierre auger ( cosmic ray ) observatory provides a laboratory for studying fundamental physics at energies far beyond those available at colliders . </S>",
    "<S> the observatory is sensitive not only to hadrons and photons , but can in principle detect ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the cosmic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it may be possible to uncover new physics by analyzing characteristics of the neutrino flux at the earth . by comparing the rate for quasi - horizontal , deeply penetrating air showers triggered by all types of neutrinos , with the rate for slightly upgoing showers generated by earth - skimming tau neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the ratio of events which would need to be detected in order to signal the existence of new non - perturbative interactions beyond the tev - scale in which the final state energy is dominated by the hadronic component . </S>",
    "<S> we use detailed monte carlo simulations to calculate the effects of interactions in the earth and in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we find that observation of 1 earth - skimming and 10 quasi - horizontal events would exclude the standard model at the 99% confidence level . if new non - perturbative physics exists , a decade or so would be required to find it in the most optimistic case of a neutrino flux at the waxman - bahcall level and a neutrino - nucleon cross - section an order of magnitude above the standard model prediction . </S>"
