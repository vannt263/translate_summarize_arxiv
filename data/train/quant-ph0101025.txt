    "it is not possible to realize a unitary gate precisely , and even when we do not intend to apply a gate , the environment will interact with the qubits causing decoherence . both imprecision and decoherence can be considered in a unified way as @xmath3errors \" which can be quantified by a fidelity distance @xmath53 or a super - operator norm @xmath51 . a crucial step in the theory of quantum computing",
    "has been the discovery of error - correcting quantum codes @xmath54 and fault - tolerant quantum computation @xmath55 .",
    "these techniques cope with sufficiently small errors .",
    "however , the error magnitude must be smaller than some constant ( called _ an accuracy threshold _ ) for these methods to work . according to rather optimistic estimates",
    ", this constant lies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , beyond the reach of current technologies .",
    "the presumptive path toward a quantum computer includes these steps : ( 1 ) build physical qubits and physical gates ; ( 2 ) minimize error level down below the threshold ; ( 3 ) implement decoherence - protected logical qubits and fault - tolerant logical gates ( one logical qubit is realized by several qubits using an error - correcting code . ) as a counterpoint , the theme of this article is that implementing physical qubits might be redundant .",
    "indeed , one can @xmath3encode \" a logical qubit into a physical system which is not quite a set of qubits or even well separated into subsystems",
    ". such a system must have macroscopic quantum degrees of freedom which would be decoherence - protected . a super - conducting phase or anything related to a local order parameter",
    "will not work for if a degree of freedom is accessible by local measurement , it is vulnerable to local error .",
    "however , there is another type of macroscopic quantum degree of freedom .",
    "it is related to topology and arises in collective electronic systems , e.g. the fractional quantum hall effect @xmath58 and most recently in @xmath59 cuprate superconductors above @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "though much studied since the mid-1980 s the connection between fractional quantum hall effect and quantum computation has only recently been realized @xmath62 .",
    "it was shown by @xmath63 that the ground state of the @xmath64 electron liquid on the torus is 3-fold degenerate .",
    "this follows from the fact that excitations in this system are abelian anyons : moving one excitation around another multiplies the state vector by a phase factor @xmath65 ( in this case @xmath66 ) . the process of creating a particle - antiparticle pair , moving one of the particles around the torus , and annihilating it specifies a unitary operator on the ground state .",
    "by moving the particle in two different directions , one obtains two different unitary operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the commutation relation @xmath69 , implying a ground state degeneracy .",
    "this argument is very robust and only requires the existence of an energy gap or , equivalently , finite correlation length @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , the degeneracy is lifted only by spontaneous tunneling of virtual excitations around the torus .",
    "the resulting energy splitting scales as @xmath71 , where @xmath18 is the size of the system .",
    "interaction with the environment does not change this conclusion , although thermal noise can create actual excitation pairs rather than virtual ones .",
    "both the ground state degeneracy on the torus and the existence of anyons are manifestations of somewhat mysterious topological properties of the @xmath64 electron liquid itself .",
    "anyons can be regarded as @xmath3topological defects \" similar to abrikosov vortices but without any local order parameter .",
    "the presence of a particle enclosed by a loop on the plane can be detected by holonomy  moving another particle around the loop .    at @xmath64 , the electron liquid on the torus could be used as a logical @xmath3qutrit \" ( generalized qubit with 3 states ) .",
    "unfortunately , this will hardly work in practice .",
    "besides the obvious problem with implementing the torus topology , there is no known way to measure this logical qutrit or prepare it in a pure state .",
    "a more flexible and controllable way of storing quantum information is based on nonabelian anyons .",
    "these are believed to exist in the @xmath72 fractional quantum hall state . according to the theory @xmath73",
    ", there should be charge @xmath74 anyonic particles and some other excitations .",
    "the quantum state of the system with @xmath75 charge @xmath74 particles on the plane is @xmath76-degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy is gradually lifted as two particles come close to each other .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath76-dimensional hilbert space @xmath77 splits into two @xmath78-dimensional subspaces .",
    "they correspond to two different types of charge @xmath23 particles which can result from fusion of charge @xmath74 particles . thus observing the fusion outcome effects a measurement on the hilbert space @xmath77 .",
    "this model supports adaptive quantum computation when surfaces of high genus are included in the theory and admits a combinatorial description @xmath79 apparently in the same universal class as the fractional quantum hall fluid .    beyond this",
    ", a discrete family of quantum hall models exists @xmath80 based on @xmath81-fold hard - core interaction between electrons in a fixed laudau level which appears to represent the same universality class as witten - chern - simons theory for @xmath82 at level=@xmath42 @xmath83 .",
    "anyons in these models behave as topological defects of a geometric construction @xmath84 and their braiding matrices have been shown to be universal @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "even after the particle types and positions of anyons are specified , there is an exponentially large ( but finite dimensional ) hilbert space describing topological degrees of freedom . in combinatorial models ,",
    "this hilbert space becomes a @xmath3code subspace `` @xmath87 of a larger @xmath3quantum media '' @xmath88 .",
    "thus a fundamental concept of cryptography is transplanted into physics .",
    "let @xmath89 be a finite dimensional complex vector space , perhaps @xmath32 , and @xmath90 an @xmath21-fold tensor product ( where @xmath21 is typically quite large . )",
    "let @xmath91 be a linear subspace .",
    "we call @xmath91 @xmath42-code if and only if : @xmath92 is multiplication by a scalar whenever @xmath93 is a @xmath42-local operator ( an arbitrary linear map on any @xmath42-tensor factors of @xmath88 and the identity on the remaining @xmath94 factors ) and @xmath95 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath87 .",
    "we think of such spaces as resisting local alteration and in the usual interpretation of @xmath88 as the hilbert space of @xmath21 particles , quantum information stored in @xmath87 will be relatively secure .",
    "it is a theorem @xmath96 that the quantum information in @xmath87 can not be degraded by errors operating on fewer than @xmath97 of the @xmath21 particles .",
    "let us define a ( discrete ) quantum medium to be a tensor product @xmath98 as above , where now the set of indices @xmath99 consists of points distributed on a geometric surface @xmath100 , together with a local hamiltonian @xmath101 ( each @xmath102 is a hermitian operator defined only on those tensor factors whose index is within @xmath103 of the @xmath104-th point in the geometry of the surface . ) local hamiltonians @xmath105 have been found @xmath106 with highly @xmath107-degenerate ground states corresponding to modular functors @xmath108 , ( and thus braid group representation @xmath109 and link polynomials @xmath110 . ) in these cases , the ground state @xmath111 of @xmath105 will be @xmath42-code for @xmath112 .",
    "the topological degrees of freedom referred to above reside in @xmath111 .",
    "but we do not attempt a precise mathematical definition of topological degrees of freedom since we would like it to extend beyond discrete system , e.g. , to fractional quantum hall ground states .    in the case",
    "when @xmath100 is a disk @xmath113 with punctures  physically _ anyonic excitations_a sequence of local modifications to @xmath105 ( see @xmath84 ) effects a discrete 1-parameter family @xmath114 of hamiltonians , where the ground states @xmath115 and @xmath116 at consecutive time steps differ by a @xmath117-local operator @xmath118 , @xmath119 . note that if @xmath115 and @xmath116 are both @xmath42-code that for @xmath118 as above , @xmath120 must be unique up to a scalar ( for a distinct @xmath121 , consider the restriction of the @xmath42-local operator @xmath122 projected to @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) .",
    "this uniqueness property forces this discrete - cryptographic transport of code spaces to coincide ( up to phase ) with the differential geometric notion of adiabatic transport  integration of the canonical connection in the @xmath3tautological `` bundle of @xmath107-planes in @xmath125 . if the 1-parameter family is a closed loop , a projective representation of the braid group on @xmath126 is obtained . by choosing @xmath105 ,",
    "these can be engineered to be precisely the hecke algebra representations @xmath127 associated to the jones polynomial . from @xmath105 one",
    "can build a concrete model of quantum computation ; the model and its connection to the jones polynomial are described below .",
    "although the @xmath105 found in @xmath84 is enormously cumbersome , it appears to share the universality class @xmath3witten - chern - simons theory of @xmath82 at level @xmath128 '' with a simple @xmath129-body hamiltonian @xmath80 , which has been proposed as a model for the fractional quantum hall plateaus at @xmath130 .",
    "a family of unitary representations of all mapping class and braid groups with certain compatibility properties under fusion is known as a unitary topological modular functor . to define our model ,",
    "we take only the planar surface portion of the simplest universal modular functor , witten - chern - simons @xmath82 modular functor at level 3 , and this reduces to the jones representations of braids @xmath131 . for an appropriate family of local hamiltonians",
    "@xmath114 , these representations describe the adiabatic transport of the lowest energy states with @xmath21 anyonic excitation pairs , these states form a subspace @xmath87 of dimension fibonacci(2n) as the @xmath75 anyonic excitations are @xmath3braided `` around each other in 2 + 1 dimensional space time . in this theory ,",
    "( we denote it @xmath132 because of its link to the jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity ) , there are 4 label types 0,1,2,3 corresponding to the complete list of irreducible representations of the quantum group @xmath133 of dimensions 1,2,3 and 4 ( or equivalently the irreducible positive energy loop group representations of @xmath134 at level @xmath128 ) .",
    "we initialize our system on the disk @xmath113 in a known state by pulling anyonic pairs out of the vacuum .",
    "this theory is self - dual so the two partners have identical types .",
    "pairs are kept or returned to the vacuum according to the results of local holonomic measurement .",
    "finally we have a known initial state in the disk with @xmath75 punctures where each puncture has label=1 and @xmath135 has label=0 .",
    "we assume @xmath21 is even and group the punctures into @xmath136 batches of 4 punctures each .",
    "similar to @xmath137 , each batch @xmath138 is used to encode one qubit @xmath139 : the basis @xmath31 is mapped into the type ( @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) of the 2-fold composite particle ( round circle ) , which would result from fusing a ( fixed ) pair of the type 1 particles within @xmath138 .",
    "initially , both the double and 4-fold composites ( ovals ) have type 0 .",
    "by maintaining , at least approximately , this condition on the ovals after the braiding is complete , we define a @xmath3computational summand '' of the modular functor : it is spanned by @xmath21-bit strings of @xmath140 s and @xmath141 s residing on the 2-fold composites ( round circles ) .",
    "now as in the quantum circuit model , a classical poly - time algorithm looks at the problem instance @xmath142 and builds a sequence of @xmath3gates \" , but this time the gates are braid generators ( right half twist between adjacent anyons ) @xmath143 , and a powerful approximation theorem @xmath144 is used to select the braid sequence which approximates the more traditional quantum circuit solving @xmath142 .",
    "so the topological model may be described as :    1 .",
    "initialization of a known state in the modular functor .",
    "classical computation of braid @xmath145 effecting a desired unitary transformation @xmath146 of the computational subspace of the modular fucntor .",
    "adiabatic implementation of the braid by ( somehow ) moving the anyons in @xmath113 to draw @xmath145 in space - time .",
    "( here we keep the anyons separated by a scale @xmath18 . )",
    "application of a projection operator @xmath147 to measure the type ( @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) of the @xmath3left most \" composite particle ( as seen in figure 1 . ) .",
    "the last step is the direct analogue of measuring the first qubit in the quantum circuit model and the same formula ( 1 ) applies : the probability of observing type 0 ( the null particle ) is : @xmath148 where the @xmath140 s on the right hand side represent our carefully prepared initial state with @xmath75 type 1 excitations .    to close the topological discussion ,",
    "we note that the previous formula can be translated ( using the @xmath149 matrix ) into a plat closure ( see figure 2 ) of a braid @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a small loop inserted to measure the left - most qubit , and now the outcome of the quantum circuit calculation , @xmath152 , becomes a jones evaluation          @xmath153 ^ 2_5 }     \\left(1+\\frac{(-1)^{c(l ) + w(l ) } ( -a)^{3 w(l ) } v_l(e^{2 \\pi i/5})}{[2]_5^{m(l)-2}}\\right);\\ ] ] where @xmath154_5 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ ] ; @xmath155 , and @xmath156 are the number of components , number of local minima , and writhe of @xmath11 respectively ; and @xmath157 .",
    "details of this calculation will be posted at url : www.tqc.iu.edu .",
    "the braiding disturbs and reforms composite particle types with sufficient subtlety to effect universal computation . to reduce this model to engineering , very significant obstacles",
    "must be overcome : stable quantum media must be maintained in a suitable phase , e.g. , @xmath132 ; excitations must be readily manipulated , and electrical neutral particle types 0 and 2 must be distinguished , presumably by holonomy experiments .",
    "although these challenges are daunting , they are , perhaps , less difficult than a head - on assault on the accuracy threshold in the quantum circuit model .",
