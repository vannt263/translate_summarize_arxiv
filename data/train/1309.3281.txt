    "we stress that the only way to directly detect the far - infrared emission of such galaxies across multiple _ herschel _ bands is to target systems that are gravitationally lensed . even in the deepest pacs and spire blank fields , this mass / redshift / sfr regime is barely accessible through stacking of tens of galaxies @xcite . therefore , it is impossible to directly compare the fir properties of our lensed galaxies to those of a well - matched , un - lensed reference sample .",
    "such a comparison is however desirable .",
    "since the lensed galaxies were selected visually based on their rest - frame uv light , there is a possibility that they represent a biased sub - sample of the high - redshift star - forming galaxy population . for example",
    ", we could expect the selection technique to preferentially isolate objects that are particularly uv - bright and therefore dust- and metal - poor .    to answer this question , we create a control sample of un - lensed galaxies , matching on mass , redshift , and ir luminosity , where the latter is obtained either from pacs or mips 24@xmath17 m photometry when available , or else derived indirectly from the optical / uv photometry .",
    "we then compare the uv - to - ir ratio between the lensed and control samples .",
    "more exactly , for each lensed galaxy , we extract a control galaxy from the goods fields catalog @xcite , within 0.2 dex in @xmath4 , 0.2 dex in @xmath37 and 0.2 in @xmath38 . to check whether the lensed galaxies are less extincted than the control sample , the distributions of @xmath39 are compared . as described in ",

    "for the goods sample , @xcite used a ladder of star formation indicators to infer the respective contributions of obscured and un - obscured star - formation , even in the absence of flux measurements at fir wavelengths , therefore also allowing a measurement of @xmath39 .",
    "a ks test gives a probability @xmath42 that the distributions of @xmath39 in the lensed and control samples are representative of the same parent population .    as a second test",
    ", we study the uv slope @xmath43 of the lensed galaxies . in figure [ irxbeta ]",
    "the lensed galaxies are shown in the @xmath44 plane , where @xmath45 is the effective uv attenuation , @xmath46 the uv slope is measured from hst optical photometry using bands corresponding to rest - frame wavelengths redwards of lyman @xmath47 .",
    "the observed values are interpolated to derive the magnitudes at 1600  and 2800  ( rest - frame ) which are then used to compute @xmath43 . as a comparison ,",
    "we use again the goods fields sample for which @xcite have derived values of the uv slope @xmath43 . this reference sample",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ irxbeta ] as gray circles .",
    "as these are pacs - detected galaxies only in the goods fields , the sample is biased towards large values of @xmath45 . to circumvent the necessity of detecting individual objects in several herschel bands",
    ", @xcite used stacks of uv - selected galaxies to probe galaxies with typically lower masses and sfrs .",
    "their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ irxbeta ] for two different bins of @xmath43 .",
    "the lensed galaxies are located in the same region of the @xmath44 as the bx / bm galaxies of @xcite , and are also seen to follow the @xcite extinction law ( solid line ) .",
    "the only exception is the eyelash , which is an outlier with high uv attenuation as expected since it is the only submillimeter - selected galaxy in the sample . using the sample of @xcite (",
    "both herschel - detected and undetected galaxies ) we can also define a control sample for each of our lensed galaxies by matching on @xmath4 , sfr and redshift . in 10 of the 12 galaxies where we have sufficient data to conduct this experiment",
    "the median of the @xmath43 distribution in the control sample agrees with the measured value of @xmath43 for the lensed galaxy within its uncertainty .",
    "the two exceptions are j0900 and j1527 where measured values of @xmath43 are -1.8 while the control samples suggest -0.6 and -1.2 , respectively .",
    "we also note that while previous studies of the cosmic eye and cb58 suggested that these objects were better represented by an smc extinction law than by the @xcite relation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the new herschel data revise the ir luminosities upward and find these galaxies in agreement with the meurer / calzetti relation .    the lack of significant differences in either the effective uv attenuation ( @xmath45 ) or the uv slope ( @xmath43 ) between the lensed galaxies of this study and their respective matched control samples suggests that they are not a biased subsample of the underlying population .",
    "we therefore proceed under the assumption that they are representative of the bulk of the star - forming galaxy population at their specific redshifts and modest masses .      in table",
    "[ sampletab ] , we give the magnification factors used to correct measured quantities for the lensing effect .",
    "the magnification factors are derived from optical imaging ( typically from hst ) , and represent the average factor across the discs of these extended galaxies .",
    "however , in reality , different regions of the galaxies may be lensed differentially , with regions falling on or near caustics being more strongly magnified .",
    "therefore , components of the galaxy having different spatial extents and compactness may not be magnified uniformly .",
    "this effect is known as differential lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in practice",
    ", this could impact our analysis since both warm dust and high@xmath48 co transitions are typically emitted in denser , more compact regions than cold dust or co ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "both the far - infrared sed and the co spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) might be biased , and standard calibrations to measure dust masses and temperatures , as well as excitation corrections to extrapolate total gas masses from a ( 3 - 2 ) line flux , may not apply @xcite . for the specific case of galaxy lenses selected in large area , flux - limited submm / fir surveys , there is a bias towards galaxies with very compact dusty star - forming regions , as these are most likely to benefit from the strongest magnifications @xcite . with the exception of the eyelash ,",
    "our lenses are not submm / fir - identified , but rather selected from cluster fields and sdss imaging . in the discovery papers , sdss galaxy lenses were typically identified visually as blue arcs .",
    "this includes the arc length , driven by the basic geometric configuration of lens and background object , as well as flux",
    ". they will therefore not suffer the specific biases discussed by @xcite , but the rest - uv emission used to derive the lensing model may still differ in extent or centroid from that at longer wavelengths .",
    "it is difficult to directly assess the impact of differential lensing , as the exercise requires detailed magnification maps , and high resolution imaging of the different components ( optical / uv continuum , fir continuum , co line emission , ... ) .",
    "the effect has therefore been so far quantified only based on simulations and very few , special galaxies . in particular ,",
    "most of the literature on this concentrates on the special case of submm- or fir - selected galaxies such as the eyelash ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen in figure [ irxbeta ] , the eyelash is a very special object , the only one in our sample to be submm - selected , and any conclusions drawn from such extreme dusty systems may not apply to all normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "we can however use these studies to get a sense of the amplitude of the issue in the most extreme cases .    using a submillimeter galaxy as a model , @xcite estimate the impact of differential lensing on fir - selected galaxy samples .",
    "they find that even when comparing quantities measured from rest - frame optical / nir wavelengths ( e.g. stellar masses ) and fir observations ( e.g. sfrs ) , the median differential magnification ratio is @xmath49 with small dispersion . therefore even in these cases , differential lensing does not affect the position of a galaxies in the sfr - mass plane significantly .",
    "@xcite find a stronger effect of differential lensing on the co sled , but the effect manifests itself mostly for transitions with @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , for the few galaxies in our sample where co(1 - 0 ) measurements are also available , a typical ( 3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) line ratio of @xmath51 is retrieved @xcite , similar to what is measured in unlensed galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a common explanation for this ubiquitous value of the ( 3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) line ratio is that the lines are emitted from the same moderately excited component of the ism , but @xcite argue that it may instead reflect a generic feature of multi - component star - forming isms , in which the different lines are emitted by different but well mixed , optically thick and thermalized components with different but characteristic filling factors .",
    "since our _ herschel _ and iram observations are mostly unresolved , it is not possible to directly assess the impact of differential lensing on our measurements . generally , this effect has not yet been extensively studied for normal star - forming high - redshift discs ( as opposed to submm- or fir - selected galaxies ) . however , based on the arguments above and the hypothesis that the fir continuum and the co line emission originate from similar physical regions ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can conclude that if occurring , differential lensing is unlikely to significantly affect the results of this study .",
    "it may be biasing our gas masses high if the co sleds are affected , but by no more than 40% , comparing our adopted excitation correction @xmath52 and the value of 1.4 indicated by the observations of the eye , eyelash and cb58 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  [ mh2section ] ) .",
    "similarly , differential lensing could be biasing the inferred dust properties .",
    "if the more compact , hotter regions of the galaxies are more strongly lensed than the diffuse component , the inferred dust temperatures could be too high ( although * ? ? ?",
    "* show that the effect can be reversed in systems with lower magnification factors of @xmath53 ) .",
    "this would result in under - estimated dust masses as well .",
    "however , the fact that we do not observe a strong effect on the co sled argues against a strong effect , but we can not rule out the possibility of a small bias and include this caveat in the discussion in  [ evolution ] .",
    "we add to the @xmath14 lensed galaxy sample additional objects from the literature to serve as a comparison point .",
    "first , we use a compilation of 16 galaxies in the goods - north field for which co line fluxes as well as deep herschel photometry are available @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are located mostly at @xmath54 and sample well the sfr - stellar mass plane .",
    "we also use the compilation of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) from @xcite , which expand the sample toward higher sfrs at fixed stellar mass and redshift .",
    "all the smgs from the @xcite compilation are used in the analysis when only dust measurements are involved , and the subset of these also found in @xcite whenever co measurements are also needed .",
    "all the galaxies in the comparison sample have _ herschel _ pacs and spire photometry , which was processed identically as for the lensed galaxy sample in order to derive infrared luminosities , sfrs , dust temperatures and dust masses ( see details in  [ firproducts ] ) .",
    "the lensed and comparison galaxy samples are shown in figure [ sfrmass ] in the sfr-@xmath4  plane for two redshift intervals , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , using the goods and egs catalogs of @xcite to provide a reference and define the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "these are the samples onto which our measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate are calibrated ( sections [ mstarsection ] and [ sfrsection ] ) , making them the best matched reference catalogs .",
    "the ms we derive from these is @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] for the three redshift intervals of @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] , respectively .    when discussing the molecular gas properties of the lensed galaxies , we also use additional references .",

    "however , irrespectively of which one of these possible explanations is valid , we can conclude that when measuring dust and gas masses though standard techniques , an offset of 0.23 dex is obtained between the measured gas - to - dust ratio and the standard @xmath10 prescription of @xcite .",

    "we first show in figure [ tdustsfe ] how both @xmath172 and the @xmath177 ratio depend on the star formation efficiency ( sfe@xmath191 ) . a correlation between these quantities",
    "is expected as @xmath172 increases as a function of @xmath192 and @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ tdustfig ] ) , and there is also a positive correlation between sfe and @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "figure [ tdustsfe ] reveals that when the gas mass in each galaxy is taken into account , most of the offset between the @xmath5 lensed galaxies and the comparison samples disappears , although the @xmath5 normal star - forming galaxies still appear to have dust temperatures higher by @xmath193k at fixed sfe compared to the reference sample ( gray symbols ) .",
    "the offset is strongest for those galaxies with the lowest metallicities .",
    "while metallicity may account for part of the remaining offset in @xmath172 at fixed sfe , there could also be a contribution from differential lensing ( see  [ difflens ] ) , which if present at all , could manifest itself in an overestimation of the dust temperatures .    in figure [ tdustmdust ]",
    "we then show a similar relation , but using the dust rather than the gas mass as the normalization factor , allowing us to include a larger number of galaxies for which dust masses are measured , but gas masses are not available . in this case again , some of the lensed galaxies appear to be systematically offset to higher @xmath172 at fixed value of sfr@xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath5 lensed galaxies having typically low metallicities , each dust grain will be exposed to more uv photons for a fixed sfr per unit gas mass , and therefore will have a hotter temperature .",

    "for example , if a value of @xmath219 is used to set the evolution of @xmath212 , the mean gas fraction expected at any redshift is lower than in the first model .",

    "an important fraction of this atomic gas is located in the outer regions of galaxies , outside of the actively star - forming disks , but even within the central regions a significant fraction of the cold gas is in atomic form as the hi - to - h@xmath143 transition typically occurs at a radius of @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "we can therefore estimate that on average within @xmath235 , @xmath236 , raising the cold gas mass fraction from 8% when only the molecular phase was considered to @xmath237 .",
    "we can not directly quantify the fraction of atomic gas in our high redshift lensed galaxies , but it could be significant given the low stellar masses .",
    "not only do we know locally that the hi fractions increase as stellar masses decrease @xcite , it can also be expected that the gas surface densities are lower in the @xmath5 , @xmath238 lensed galaxies than in others at the high - mass end of the star - formation main sequence .",
    "therefore , an additional interpretation for the low mean value of @xmath239 at @xmath209 is that a higher fraction of the cold gas mass is in neutral form than in the sample at @xmath240 and 2.2 .",
    "however , were we missing a significant cold gas component , we would have measured lower than expected gas - to - dust ratios , as any dust should be mixed with both the molecular and atomic phases of the ism .",
    "figure [ gdr ] shows the opposite behavior , suggesting that the lower gas fraction measured at @xmath12 is not the result of neglecting the atomic component .",
    "the main observational results presented in this paper can be summarized as :    1 .",
    "we measure a mean molecular gas depletion time of 450 myr at @xmath241 .",
    "this decrease of @xmath212 by a factor of 5 since @xmath10 and 1.5 since @xmath9 is consistent with the expected scaling of @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) if the depletion time is linked to the dynamical timescale .",
    "our results validate up to @xmath202 and down to @xmath4@xmath1@xmath2  the calibration of this relation established by @xcite out to @xmath244 using data from the phibss and cold gass surveys and a metallicity - dependent conversion factor .",
    "the mean gas fraction measured at @xmath209 is @xmath13 ( 44% after accounting for sample incompleteness ) , suggesting that the trend of increasing gas fraction with redshift ( @xmath245 $ ] at @xmath246 $ ] ) does not extend beyond @xmath14 .",
    "this observation is consistent with recent studies suggesting that the evolution of the mean ssfr of main - sequence galaxies slows down or even reaches a plateau beyond @xmath221 .",
    "3 .   the lensed galaxies at @xmath5 exhibit high dust temperatures , with values of @xmath35k such as found typically only in galaxies with extreme ir luminosities .",
    "the high values of @xmath172 are a consequence of the fact that the lensed galaxies have low metallicities and short gas depletion times , as expected for their high redshifts and low stellar masses .",
    "4 .   using co line luminosities , dust masses , and direct metallicity measurements , the conversion factor @xmath154  for the lensed galaxies is estimated using the  inverse kennicutt - schmidt \" and the gas - to - dust ratio methods , and in both cases agrees with a scaling of @xmath154@xmath247 as parametrized by @xcite .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratios in the @xmath5 lensed galaxies exhibit the same metallicity dependence as observed in the local universe , but with a systematic offset ( fig .",
    "[ gdr ] ) . at fixed metallicity",
    ", we observe @xmath15 to be larger by a factor of 1.7 at @xmath5 , suggesting that applying the local calibration of the @xmath15-metallicity relation to infer the molecular gas mass of high redshift galaxies may lead to systematic differences with co - based estimates .",
    "most of these results could be explained by assuming that our lensed galaxies sample , mostly selected in sdss imaging based on high luminosities at rest - uv wavelengths , is heavily biased toward dust - poor objects .",
    "this could serve to explain for example the high dust temperatures , the low dust and gas masses , and the short depletion times .",
    "however , we have conducted extensive tests ( see  [ samplebias ] ) , and could not find evidence of any such bias .",
    "instead , the sample appears to be representative of the overall population of main sequence galaxies at @xmath241 with @xmath248@xmath2 . while it should be kept in mind that sample biases may be present , in the absence of evidence to the contrary we have proceeded with the analysis under the assumption that our results apply to the bulk of the high redshift galaxy population .",
    "the combined herschel and iram observations presented in this paper then suggest that main sequence galaxies with modest stellar masses ( @xmath249 ) at @xmath241 have high star formation efficiencies and a molecular gas mass fraction no larger than measured at @xmath230 , consistently with a simple model where the redshift evolution of the characteristic ssfr of main - sequence galaxies can be explained by a slowly varying gas depletion time and the measured gas fractions .",
    "the short depletion times and the possible redshift evolution of the gas - to - dust ratio imply that these high redshift galaxies have less dust at fixed sfr , producing the high @xmath172 values we measure as each dust grain is exposed to more radiation ( fig .",
    "[ tdustfig ] ) .    before concluding , we wish to point out that the equilibrium model on which this analysis relies requires that the gas depletion timescale is shorter than the accretion timescale .",
    "this balance is reached at a redshift @xmath250 . at @xmath251 ,",
    "the star formation process can not keep up with the accretion of new gas , and this is thus the epoch where the gas reservoirs of the galaxies are filling up with gas fractions expected to be high .",
    "the exact value of @xmath250 is however still debated .",
    "for example , @xcite found that @xmath252 in the absence of outflows , but that even modest outflows raised the threshold to @xmath253 , the latter value being in agreement with the analytical work of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath252 , and @xcite estimate that @xmath254 , using a sample of lyman break galaxies and an indirect measurement of gas fractions .    in this study , we have used direct measurements of co line fluxes and the power of gravitational lensing to push to higher redshifts the study of the redshift evolution of gas fractions . after correcting for sample incompleteness , @xcite measure a mean gas fraction of 47% at @xmath200 . in this study",

    "j1137 is a galaxy - scale gravitational lens system , where a luminous red galaxy ( i.e. the lens galaxy ) at @xmath257 is forming a bright blue arc of the background source ( i.e. the source galaxy ) .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of the bright blue arc by @xcite confirms a primary source galaxy redshift of @xmath258 and shows evidence of a secondary source galaxy at @xmath259 .",
    "as shown in figure 2 of @xcite , sdss imaging of the blue arc resembles two split knots and does not distinguish between the two background sources that are very close in redshift , forming nearly overlapping multiple images .",
    "however , multiwavelength _",
    "hst_-wfpc2 imaging of sdss j1137 indicates that the bright blue arc is comprised of several images , as shown in figure  [ fig : sdssj1137 + 4936](_left _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sdssj1137 + 4936](_right _ ) demonstrates the subtraction of the lens galaxy light profile , showing the lensed features more clearly :    * features * a * through * c * , which resemble three small knots merging together to form a faint secondary arc , result from the lensing of the source galaxy at @xmath259 * feature * d * is an extraneous , non - lensing object that is masked during the initial lens modeling process * feature * e * corresponds to the primary lensed arc , resulting from the lensing of the source galaxy at @xmath258 .",
    "therefore , an accurate lens model must account for all images except * d*.    we use lensfit @xcite , an extension of the galaxy decomposition software galfit @xcite for strong gravitational lens analysis , to derive the lens model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and bandara et al .",
    "( 2013 , apj submitted ) , for a detailed overview of lensfit and its application for the analysis of galaxy - scale gravitational lenses discovered in the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey , and summarize our methodology below . to describe the mass distribution of the lens galaxy ,",
    "we assume a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass model ( sie , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an external shear field to model the tidal effects by nearby objects .",
    "the projected mass density of the sie model is , @xmath260^{-1/2 } \\label{eq : sie}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath261 is the mass scale and @xmath262 is the axis ratio of the mass model .",
    "the mass scale parameter ( @xmath261 ) is approximately the einstein radius of the lens ( denoted as @xmath263 ) ; however , this relation is only exact at the @xmath264 limit @xcite . at this limit",
    ", @xmath263 is related to the physical quantities of the mass model by , @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the velocity dispersion of the mass model and @xmath267 and @xmath268 are angular diameter distances from the lens to the source galaxy and from the observer to the source galaxy respectively @xcite . the sie mass model of lensfit",
    "is characterized by the following parameters : mass model centroid ( @xmath269 ) , einstein radius ( @xmath263 ) , axis ratio of the mass model ( @xmath270 ) , position angle of the major axis measured e from n ( @xmath271 ) , external shear ( @xmath272 ) and the position angle of the external shear component measured e from n ( @xmath273 ) .",

    "the elliptically symmetric @xmath282 profile is characterized by the following parameters : position of the @xmath282 component ( @xmath283 ) , half - light radius ( @xmath278 ) , apparent magnitude ( @xmath284 ) , the @xmath282 index ( _ n _ ) , axis ratio of the elliptical profile ( @xmath262 ) and the position angle of the major axis measured e from n ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "we perform the lens modeling of j1137 in the _",
    "hst_-wfpc2 filters f814w , f606w and f450w .",
    "since the gravitational lensing phenomenon is achromatic , the mass - model should be identical across multiple filters within the systematic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , when modeling a gravitational lens in multiple filters , the mass - model parameters are typically fixed to those determined by the highest signal - to - noise filter ( in this case , the f814w filter ) . however , we allow the sie mass model parameters to vary freely for the f606w filter ( which also has high signal - to - noise ) , such that we can test whether the lens modeling process is sufficiently robust to converge to the same mass model parameters for different filters .",
    "we find that the sie mass model parameters from f814w and f606w imaging are virtually indistinguishable , thus confirming that the lens model solution is robust .",
    "since f450w imaging has a lower signal - to - noise , we initially fix the sie mass model parameters to those constrained by f814w and f606w imaging . during the final iteration of the f450w lens model , we allow the mass model to vary freely and find that the fractional difference between f450w parameters and those obtained from f814w / f606w imaging is less than @xmath285 .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath258 _ unlensed _ source galaxy ( which forms the lensed arc * e * on the image plane ) is best described by three @xmath282 components , in the f814w and f606w filters , and two @xmath282 components in the f450w filter .",
    "in addition , the morphology of the @xmath259 unlensed source galaxy ( which forms features a through c on the image plane ) is best described by a single @xmath282 component in all three filters .",
    "figure  [ fig : lensfit_breakdown1 ] shows the results of lens modeling of sdss j1137 in the f814w filter . as indicated by the `` double residual '' image of sdss j1137 , shown in the fourth panel of figure  [ fig : lensfit_breakdown1 ]",
    ", the complete lens model predicts images * a * through * c * and * e * but not * d * ( which was unmasked during the final steps of the lensing analysis ) .",
    "lensfit output parameters include the unlensed flux of each @xmath282 component of the source galaxy light profile . due to the circular feedback mechanism between the mass model and the source galaxy light profile , the use of multiple @xmath282 components to describe the unlensed source galaxy yields the best - fit mass model .",
    "in other words , it is important to minimize the residuals of the source galaxy light profile to fully constrain the mass model , using multiple @xmath282 components if necessary .",
    "however , from the standpoint of computing the overall intrinsic properties of the source galaxy ( e.g. for comparison with non - lensed galaxy samples ) , we require a simplified representation that mimics the analysis techniques of high - redshift studies which typically use a single @xmath282 component in galaxy fitting . therefore , we compute the _ global _ properties of the unlensed @xmath258 source galaxy ( i.e. the flux of a _ single _ @xmath282 component that best minimizes the overall residuals ) by performing an additional lensfit iteration using single @xmath282 components . the sie mass model , which was fully constrained by the use of multiple @xmath282 components to define the @xmath258 source galaxy , and the @xmath259 source galaxy light profile parameters are fixed to those implied by the best - fit lens model .    for this study ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the magnification factor of the source galaxy at @xmath258 resulting in lensed image * e * , defined as @xmath286 we use the sextractor photometry package @xcite to deblend and measure the flux within the lensed image * e * in all three filters .",
    "we then combine the total flux of the lensed image , obtained from the sextractor photometry , and the unlensed flux of the _ global _ source galaxy profile to derive the magnification factor , according to equation  [ eq : magnification ] .",
    "the total magnification factor of sdss j1137 is the mean value of f814w , f606w and f450w filters and corresponds to @xmath287 . to estimate the uncertainty on this measurement , we propagate the errors coming from the determination of both the unlensed and lensed galaxy fluxes , of which the magnification factor is the ratio .",
    "the former includes the error on the slope of the mass model @xcite , the error caused by the lens galaxy subtraction , and the error associated with the psf model , while the lensed galaxy flux uncertainty comes only from the sextractor photometry . including all these sources of uncertainty , we arrive at a total error of 18@xmath288 for the magnification factor of j1137 .",
    "this also justifies our choice of a blanket 20% uncertainty on the magnification factors taken from the literature when published without an uncertainty value ( see table [ sampletab ] ) .",

    "the _ spitzer _ archive was queried for observations of the lensed galaxies in the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath17 m bands , and the calibrated images retrieved .",
    "the only lensed galaxy in our sample without irac coverage is j1441 .",
    "the 3.6@xmath17 m images of the other 16 galaxies are shown in figure [ stamps ] .",
    "most of the lensed galaxies appear as extended arcs in the irac images , and they are generally located within the wings of the foreground lenses , which are typically bright at these wavelengths .",
    "for these two main reasons , standard photometry packages are not optimal and instead a custom idl script was written to measure accurate fluxes .",
    "we define an annulus , typically centered on the foreground lens , that encompasses fully the arc .",
    "the section of this annulus containing the arc is used to integrate the flux of the object , and the remaining section is used to estimate the background , as indicated n figure [ stamps ] .",
    "the advantages of this approach are twofold : ( 1 ) the shape of the aperture naturally matches well that of the lensed arcs , and ( 2 ) the background is estimated over a region with equivalent noise properties and contamination from the bright lens .",
    "the exact parameters defining the aperture ( inner and outer radii , position angle and opening angle ) are fixed using curve of growth arguments . in figure",
    "[ stamps ] , the curves of growth obtained by changing the outer radius of the apertures are shown . the background level within the aperture",
    "is estimated by measuring the mode of the sky pixels in the  background aperture \" and multiplying it by the area of the aperture .",
    "the mode is calculated with the mmm task in idl ( based of the daophot task of the same name ) , allowing an accurate measure of the sky properties even in the presence of bright point sources within the  background aperture \" .",
    "the error on the total flux of the lensed galaxy is obtained by adding in quadrature the uncertainty on the flux in the aperture from the irac error map , the scatter in the sky values , and the uncertainty in the mean sky brightness .    some of the lensed galaxies are however best modeled by a simple circular aperture than with an arc aperture .",
    "this is the case of the eye , the eyelash , cb58 , j0744 , j1149 and j1226 . in those cases ,",
    "a simple circular aperture is used , with a radius determined from the curve of growth ( see fig . [ stamps ] ) .",
    "the background is determined from an annulus around this aperture , using the same technique described above .",
    "for the lensed galaxy j0712 , neither technique produces reliable results , since the faint blue arc is heavily blended with the brighter lens , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stamps ] . for that galaxy ,",
    "we adopt the stellar mass of @xmath291 derived by @xcite from sed fitting to the hst photometry .",
    "the final , background subtracted fluxes at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath17 m are summarized in table [ masstab ] , and our methodology to derive stellar masses from these fluxes is described in  [ mstarsection ] .",
    "the lensed galaxy j0901 has been reported by @xcite to harbor an agn , based on a high [ nii]/h@xmath47 ratio , above the range expected from star forming galaxies , suggesting excitation of the lines through agn and/or shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "care must therefore be taken that the agn emission does not affect our estimates of stellar mass and star formation rate . since",
    "our stellar masses are derived from the irac photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath17 m , we compare in figure [ j0901sed ] the shape of the observed near - infrared spectral energy distribution to templates from the swire library @xcite .",
    "the emission observed in the irac bands is fully consistent with the starburst templates , suggesting that the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath17 m fluxes ( and therefore the stellar mass derived from them ) are not affected by the presence of an agn .",
    "@xcite also concluded from _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy that the contribution of the agn to the mid - infrared emission is insignificant and that the system is instead starburst - driven . in the absence of an agn signature at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths , it can be safely concluded that there is no contamination at even longer wavelengths and therefore that the sfr and dust mass / temperature derived from the herschel photometry are secure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of agn contamination in the far - infrared ) .",
    "however , given the un - physically high [ nii]/h@xmath47 ratio for star - forming regions , we adopt for this galaxy the metallicity given by the mz relation , @xmath292 .",
    "this value is consistent with the lower limit of 1.3@xmath293 reported by @xcite based on argon line fluxes from _ spitzer _ mid - infrared spectroscopy .      in the absence of a [ nii]/h@xmath47 ratio measurement",
    ", we computed the metallicity for j1226 using the @xmath144 and @xmath294 indicators , using h@xmath43 , [ oiii ] and [ oii ] line fluxes from the spectrum of @xcite , further corrected for extinction ( j.r . rigby , private communication ) .",
    "the values derived are @xmath295 and @xmath296 . to compute a metallicity from these line ratios",
    ", we use the calibration of @xcite as parametrized by @xcite .",
    "the measured values of @xmath144 and @xmath297 put this galaxy at the transition between the two branches of the relation , with 12@xmath298o / h@xmath2998.46 and 8.45 for the lower and upper branches , respectively .",
    "we can therefore obtain a reliable metallicity estimate , even without [ nii]/h@xmath47 to discriminate between the two branches .",
    "finally , we use the relation of @xcite to convert this metallicity on the @xcite scale , for consistency with the rest of the sample ( section [ metalsection ] ) .",
    "the final value we adopt for j1226 is therefore 12@xmath298o / h@xmath300 , where the uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the propagated measurement errors , and the average scatter of 0.15 in the @xcite calibration ."
