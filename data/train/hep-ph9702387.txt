    "<S> the pole - type terms given by @xmath11 and the @xmath12 intermediate states@xmath13 are individually of leading order @xmath4 , but their added contribution cancels at this order due to the gell - mann - okubo relation@xmath14 and is in effect of order @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , important to perform a complete analysis of the decays at this order . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the one - loop terms of order @xmath2 stemming from the odd - intrinsic parity terms of the @xmath3 non - leptonic effective hamiltonian of order @xmath4 and not previously evaluated , affect both types of decays in a potentially significant way . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in particular , a contribution to the amplitude of the two - gamma decay proportional to @xmath15 that can be a substantial addition to the pole - type term . in the case of the dalitz decays , the experimentally observed non - trivial form factor in terms of the dilepton invariant mass is usually described using the vmd model of bergstrm , mass and singer @xmath16 , which gives a satisfactory parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> the work of ko@xmath17 provides a thorough study of vmd in radiative decays . </S>",

    "<S> our calculation includes long distance pieces given by the chiral loops , and a short distance piece due to a counterterm needed to renormalize the loops is determined by fitting to the data . for our purpose , </S>",

    "<S> there is a long list of terms ( forty eight octet terms when external sources of different kinds are included ) @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant terms to us are those that affect the virtual transitions @xmath46 , including terms that break su(3 ) symmetry due to the quark masses , and terms that give the amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> , \\pi ^{+ } \\pi ^{- } + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second lagrangian we do not display terms that do not contribute in our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the su(3 ) singlet meson @xmath65 , being a massive state due to the @xmath66 anomaly , can be integrated out or , equivalently , included explicitly in a meson pole dominance model@xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath65 contribution to the decays is naturally of order @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath65 and @xmath68 mix with each other due to su(3 ) breaking , we find it more convenient to include @xmath65 explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> we need to consider both , the terms that contribute to the virtual transition @xmath69 as well as the wz term , which leads to the standard amplitude for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle between the @xmath71 mesons and the decay constants as obtained from their two - gamma decays and the @xmath72 result for @xmath73@xmath35 are : @xmath74 the virtual weak amplitude @xmath75 is not known , and is characterized in the following by a parameter @xmath76 .    in the limit of cp conservation , the @xmath77 amplitude has the most general form : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a virtual photon , and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for the two - gamma decay mode is @xmath81 and the dilepton distribution of the dalitz decays is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the mass of the lepton , and @xmath85    there are two different sets of diagrams contributing to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the first set are the pole terms shown in figures 1 and 2 involving the virtual transitions @xmath87 followed by the two - photon decay modes driven by the wz term . </S>",
    "<S> the second set of diagrams , shown in figure 2 , requires the weak interaction transitions @xmath29 and @xmath88 .    as mentioned before </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath49 contributions due to the @xmath11 and @xmath68 poles cancel each other due to the gell - mann - okubo ( gmo ) relation@xmath14 . at @xmath89 one - loop corrections and counterterms </S>",
    "<S> must be considered . from this </S>",
    "<S> various effects result . </S>",
    "<S> one is due to the deviation from the gmo relation , which is taken into account by replacing the lowest order masses by the physical masses . </S>",
    "<S> another one is due to su(3 ) breaking in virtual amplitudes @xmath90 with respect to @xmath91 , which we take into account by means of the parameter @xmath92 below . </S>",
    "<S> a final effect stems from the one - loop corrections to the wz term . as shown in@xmath93 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a @xmath94 independent piece that is taken into account by simply replacing the decay constants in the chiral limit by the physical decay constants , while the @xmath94 dependent piece requires renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the latter only appears in contributions to the @xmath95 decay of order @xmath96 , and can therefore be altogether disregarded . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the @xmath94-dependent corrections to the wz term have the same relative weight for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 as in the wz term itself@xmath93 , and therefore the mechanism of cancellation by the gmo relation eliminates the order @xmath2 terms . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath97 contribution is already of order @xmath2 at tree level , the one loop corrections are of order @xmath96 and , therefore , disregarded . from this , the pole piece of @xmath86 can be expressed as follows@xmath67 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 we emphasize that @xmath100 is very sensitive to the parameteres @xmath76 and @xmath92 , and therefore , can not be reliably predicted .      </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath94-dependent piece needs renormalization provided by the counterterm @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the t - independent uv divergencies cancel when the two diagrams in figure 2 are added . </S>",
    "<S> the t - dependent piece needs renormalization that is , as usual , accomplished by replacing in ( 14 ) @xmath109 plus the term proportional to @xmath110 by @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown later , this counterterm can be estimated by analyzing the data . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath112 is unaffected by counterterm uncertainties , and is non - vanishing and proportional to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this term is thus a new addition to the @xmath9 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> notice that one can write a finite counterterm for the @xmath113 piece . </S>",
    "<S> such a counterterm is included in @xmath100 , and in the pole model it is given by the @xmath97 intermediate state as already discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the situation here resembles that of the strong interaction case at order @xmath4 , where the term proportional to the low energy constant @xmath114 only provides a finite renormalization , and is in fact dominated by the @xmath97 pole@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath94 independent pieces of @xmath86 vanish in the chiral limit in accordance with the veltman - sutherland theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> the unknown parameters affecting the two - photon and dalitz modes are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , while the counterterm @xmath111 only affects the dalitz mode . </S>",
    "<S> when we neglect the t - dependence in @xmath117 , ( 10 ) gives @xmath118 and the ratios with the experimental values are @xmath20 : @xmath119 thus , ( 17 ) is an excellent approximation in the @xmath120 mode , where most of the rate is given by the low - t domain where the relative t - dependence is very small , while in the @xmath27 case @xmath121 is large enough for the @xmath94-dependence to be noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , on the basis of the total rate of the @xmath27 dalitz mode it is clear that there is a significant @xmath94-dependence in @xmath117 , as was first experimentally noticed by the e799 collaboration @xmath26 . denoting for the sake of convenience , @xmath122 from the ratio @xmath123 we find that they are approximately linearly related as @xmath124 with this relation we also find an excellent fit to both dilepton invariant mass distributions@xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the dalitz decays alone can not pin - down @xmath126 and the counterterm . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to invoke further observables for this to be possible . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath126 can also be estimated by means of two other processes , namely , @xmath9 and @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the first process is given in terms of @xmath128 with @xmath129 from the @xmath9 width ( 9 ) this combination has the value @xmath130 . on the other hand , the second process permits a model dependent estimate of a different combination@xmath30 , namely , @xmath131 while in ( 21 ) both terms are of the same chiral order , in ( 22 ) the first term is of lower order than the second . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath126 gives the strength of the direct emission @xmath132 amplitude of order @xmath4 , while the second term appears in the correction of order @xmath2 to that amplitude@xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> there is , in addition , the theoretically well known internal bremsstrahlung amplitude of order @xmath39 that is cp violating and can not interfere with the direct emission one because it is of electric type . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the direct emission decay rate can be cleanly identified , and the combination in ( 22 ) is then estimated to be in the interval 0.3 to 0.9 @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the positive sign of the combination is favored by a factorization model@xmath30 , but the possibility of a negative sign is not altogether ruled out . for a similar negative interval the conclusions we draw here remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> taking the estimated range at face value , we obtain @xmath126 and @xmath133 for the two possible signs of @xmath134 as shown in the table . </S>",
    "<S> a first consequence is that the amplitude for the two - gamma decay has a potentially important addition beyond the pole terms , depending on the scenario , defined by the sign of @xmath135 , one considers . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in the table by the ratio @xmath136 , which can be as large as @xmath137 .    </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the dalitz decay form factor defined by @xmath138 is consistent with the experimental value obtained from the @xmath120 mode , @xmath139@xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the acceptable range of @xmath126 ( 20 ) gives @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the chiral logarithm terms as well as the counterterm give positive contributions to the slope . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the slope due to the counterterm is shown in the last entry of the table . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in one case it is dominating , giving support to the vmd model@xmath16 , while in the other case there are important chiral logarithm terms as well .    </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath27 mode shows more prominently the t - dependence , the results are mostly determined by that mode . in turn , for the @xmath142 mode we predict @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is consistent within the @xmath144 error of the experimental result ( 18 ) .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our leading order analysis shows two acceptable scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> in one of them there are sizeable long distance contributions from one - loop diagrams to both types of radiative decays considered , while in the other such contributions are small , implying that vmd models are an excellent picture . </S>",
    "<S> the question of which of the two scenarios is actually realized is clearly important . </S>"
