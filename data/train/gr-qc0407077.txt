    "a progress related to several quantum phenomena that take place on the event horizon of black holes is outlined .",
    "one of the effects discussed here is the well known hawking radiation .",
    "the other two phenomena examined were found only recently .",
    "they are the reflection on the event horizon of black holes , and the escape of particles from the confinement within the inside region of the horizon into the outside world .",
    "the effect of the hawking radiation @xcite , and the closely related unruh process @xcite , have links with the entropy of black holes studied by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on the hawking effect and thermodynamics properties of black holes see @xcite .",
    "treatment of quantum phenomena on the event horizon , including the problem of the origin of the entropy of black holes , the density of its quantum states , and the brick wall model can be found in the reviews by t hooft @xcite , see also his ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of reflection on the event horizon , which will be discussed in detail in this work , has strong connections with the scattering problem .",
    "the first analytical results in the scattering problem were obtained by starobinsky @xcite for the scalar field and starobinsky and churilov @xcite for electromagnetic and gravitational waves scattered by the rotating kerr black hole . independently , unruh @xcite considered scattering of scalar and fermion particles by schwarzschild black holes .",
    "a detailed study of the scattering problem was given by sanchez @xcite .",
    "after these and a number of subsequent works , it has been assumed that the scattering problem is completely understood , see details and bibliography in the books .",
    "however , it was found recently in refs .",
    "@xcite that a particle approaching the black hole can bounce on the horizon back into the outside world .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to below as the reflection on the horizon ( rh ) .",
    "the effect arises due to pure quantum reasons , being obviously absent in the classical approximation .",
    "the rh prompts a strong decrease in the absorption cross section , reducing it to a zero value in the infrared region , as was shown explicitly in @xcite for scattering of scalar massless particles on schwarzschild black holes .",
    "this behavior of the cross section differs qualitatively from the previously accepted result , which stated that the low energy absorption cross section equals the area of the horizon @xcite .",
    "the similar reduction of the cross section is expected to take place for scattering of any massless particle by any black hole in the low energy limit .",
    "the quantum phenomena that prompt the existence of the rh have another unexpected manifestation , for particles confined inside the horizon .",
    "classically this confinement is absolute .",
    "however , the quantum treatment of the problem in refs .",
    "@xcite revealed that the wave function of any confined particle necessarily has a particular admixture that behaves on the horizon as the outgoing wave .",
    "this property of the wave function indicates that any confined particle has a chance to escape from the inside region into the outside world .",
    "thus , the confinement inside a black hole is not perfect , a particle locked inside has a chance to find its way out .",
    "we will refer to this opportunity as the escape effect ( ee ) .",
    "the hawking radiation process can be considered as a manifestation of the ee in particular circumstances , when a black hole is put inside the temperature bath . however , in the general case the ee allows the extraction of information from the inside region of the horizon into the outside world .",
    "this work briefly summarizes some of the arguments of @xcite related to the rh and ee .",
    "units @xmath0 are used , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the gravitational constant and the black hole mass ; the gravitational radius in these units reads @xmath3 .",
    "let us formulate briefly the results of refs.@xcite . consider for simplicity the scalar massless field in the vicinity of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "take a scalar particle with the energy @xmath4 and zero orbital momentum @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to verify ( see e. g. @xcite , or eqs.([in]),([outout ] ) below ) that the corresponding wave function exhibits behavior @xmath6 $ ] on the horizon @xmath7 , where the signs minus and plus describe the waves propagating inside and outside of the horizon respectively .",
    "the general form of the wave function on the horizon is therefore @xmath8       + \\mathcal{r }      \\exp [ i \\varepsilon \\ln ( r-1)\\,]~.       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] suppose we consider the scattering problem , the impact of scalar particles on the black hole . then the first term in eq.([gen ] ) is definitely present , it describes the flux of incoming particles .",
    "it seems also _ natural _ to expect that there is no second term , because the horizon is _ presumed _ to be a prefect absorber . in other words",
    ", it seems natural to put in eq.([gen ] ) @xmath9 .",
    "exactly this condition has always been used in the scattering problem for different particles ( scalars , spinors , electromagnetic and gravitational waves ) and different types of black holes ( schwarzschild , kerr and others ) , see the pioneering refs .",
    "@xcite , later developments can be found in the review @xcite and books @xcite .",
    "it was unexpected therefore that refs .",
    "@xcite argued that @xmath10 in eq.([gen ] ) has , in fact , a nonzero value , specifically that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hawking temperature . the fact that @xmath13 means that there is a reflected wave in eq.([gen ] ) that gives rise to the flux of outgoing particles .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath10 is to be called the reflection coefficient . the fact that it is nonzero indicates that a particle can bounce on the horizon back into the outside world .",
    "eq.([r ] ) presents an explicit form for the effect that was called the rh in section [ intro ] . for low energies @xmath14",
    "the rh is very effective , which makes the horizon a good _ reflector _ in the infrared region .",
    "this property is in contrast with the conventional point of view that presumes the horizon to be a perfect absorber .",
    "eq.([r ] ) has a profound influence on the absorption cross section for low energies of incoming particles @xmath15 . assuming conventional properties of the horizon ( @xmath16 ) unruh found @xcite that in the infrared region the cross section equals the area of the horizon @xmath17 ( here and in eq.([kf ] ) below conventional units are used . )",
    "taking the rh into account ref .",
    "@xcite arrived at a different result @xmath18 which means that the cross section vanishes for low energy .",
    "there is an appealing physical picture suggested in @xcite that describes the rh as a creation of a pair at the horizon followed by an annihilation of one of the created particles with the inner particle inside the black hole .",
    "this is close to the usual physical explanation of the hawking effect via the pair production .",
    "below . at this point , however , we stick to the conventional point of view , neglecting this complication in order to present the rh in the commonly used terms . ]",
    "eqs.([gen]),([r ] ) and ( [ kf ] ) summarize the main claims that refs .",
    "@xcite made for the outside region .",
    "later on , in section [ inside ] , we will discuss the implications of these results for the inside region .",
    "the book of khriplovich @xcite mentions qualitative arguments put forward by gribov in early 70 s , which indicated that black holes are capable of radiating .",
    "one of his reasons , as the book presents it , was that `` it is obvious that a black hole is incapable of containing radiation with the wavelength exceeding the gravitational radius '' ( p. 112 of @xcite , in our translation from russian ) .",
    "this argument may look simplistic ( though it was not the only one articulated by gribov ) , but keeping in mind that it was made before the hawking finding , its simplicity bears , arguably , an aura of a classical foreseeing .    if one allows oneself to rely on this argument in the scattering problem",
    ", one has to conclude that the absorption of particles with large wavelengths by a black hole should meet a difficulty , in other words it should be suppressed .",
    "this is exactly what eq.([kf ] ) which takes the rh into account predicts .",
    "in contrast , eq.([un ] ) which neglects the rh shows no sign of such suppression .",
    "thus , one may argue that the rh is in line with the gribov argument related to large wavelengths .",
    "let us discuss a simple argument used in refs .",
    "@xcite to justify validity of the rh .",
    "consider the schwarzschild geometry with the metric @xmath19 where @xmath20 describes the contribution of angular variables .",
    "take the scalar field , assuming for simplicity that it is massless .",
    "choose the most important for us wave with the zero orbital momentum @xmath5 .",
    "then the radial wave function @xmath21 for the stationary state with energy @xmath4 satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath22 making the substitution @xmath23^{1/2 } \\phi(r)$ ] one can rewrite eq.([phi  ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 reducing it to the form of the conventional schrdinger - type equation , if @xmath26 is considered as an effective , energy - dependent potential ( note that it is strictly attractive ) , and @xmath27 on the left - hand side is accepted as the eigenvalue .",
    "consider the scattering problem , the impact of scalar particles on the black hole .",
    "then , definitely there is the incoming wave that falls on the horizon . in the proximity of the horizon @xmath28",
    "this wave reads @xmath29,\\quad          r>1~ ,        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as can be verified using eq.([phi  ] ) , or ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "let us look at the problem from the traditional point of view .",
    "there is the incoming wave eq.([in ] ) , and there is the potential eq.([uu ] ) .",
    "one can expect therefore that there should exist also the outgoing wave , which is always present in quantum mechanical problems of this type .",
    "this is true even for attractive potentials .",
    "the only distinction for the attractive potentials is that the reflection for them is prompted by pure quantum reasons , being absent in the classical approximation . as a result ,",
    "the reflection coefficient is to be exponentially small . in the problem at hand ,",
    "the potential @xmath26 in eq.([uu ] ) is smooth in the region @xmath30 , the semiclassical approximation works well for it , with the only exception of the horizon @xmath31 , where the potential has a singular point @xmath32",
    ".    we can apply therefore conventional semiclassical methods by taking the incoming wave eq.([in ] ) and continuing it into the region @xmath33 by means of the analytical continuation over the lower semiplane of the complex plane @xmath34 that avoids the singularity at @xmath31 .",
    "the result , which reads @xmath35,\\quad r<1~ ,        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shows that the incoming wave exists in the inside region @xmath33 .",
    "we need to determine therefore what happens to the wave function at the origin @xmath36 , where , generally speaking , it behaves as @xmath37 . as usual",
    ", a solution regular at the origin should be chosen .",
    "such a solution can not be constructed from the incoming wave eq.([inin ] ) , which necessarily incorporates the part singular at @xmath36 .",
    "we derive from this fact that in the region @xmath33 there should exist also the outgoing wave , which combines with the incoming wave to make the total wave function regular at the origin . in the vicinity of the horizon",
    "the outgoing wave can be presented as @xmath38~,\\quad r<1 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it has the same magnitude as the incoming wave ( to allow a compensation of their singular parts at the origin ) , shifted , possibly , by a phase @xmath39 that depends on details of the wave propagation far away from the horizon .    this outgoing wave can now be continued into the region @xmath30 by using ( again ) the analytical continuation over the lower semiplane of the complex plane @xmath34 . as a result",
    "we find that there exists the outgoing wave in the outside region @xmath40~,\\quad r>1 ,        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient is @xmath41 we come to the important conclusion . alongside the incoming wave eq.([in ] ) , the wave function necessarily incorporates also the outgoing wave eq.([outout ] ) , in agreement with eq.([gen ] ) .",
    "the value for the reflection coefficient eq.([rr ] ) found here supports eq.([r ] ) .",
    "this reflection coefficient is exponentially small for high energies , in accord with the naive anticipation for scattering on an attractive potential .",
    "if one applies a different analytical continuation , over the upper semiplane , one ends up with the large reflection coefficient @xmath42 that is physically unacceptable .",
    "this fact can be used as an indication that the chosen way for the analytical continuation is correct .",
    "detailed validation of analytical properties of the wave function should be based on the causality condition , but we do not go into these details here , see more on the subject in @xcite ]    in conclusion , the effective attractive potential eq.([uu ] ) , which is associated with the horizon , is able to reflect the incoming wave , which means that the rh really takes place .",
    "the effect has a similarity with the well known quantum phenomenon of the above - barrier reflection .",
    "the methods used here for its derivation are close to the conventional semiclassical treatment of the above - barrier reflection .",
    "let us discuss another argument in favor of the rh , which was presented in @xcite .",
    "consider the wave function @xmath21 as an analytical function defined on the complex plane @xmath34 .",
    "take the real , physical value for @xmath34 in the vicinity of the horizon , @xmath43 , where eq.([gen ] ) is valid ; then rotate @xmath34 around the point @xmath31 on the complex plane @xmath34 over an angle of @xmath44 clockwise . , where we applied similar rotation on the complex plane .",
    "however in section [ reflection ] the angle of rotation was chosen @xmath45 , which brought @xmath34 into the inside region @xmath33 . in contrast , the @xmath44 rotation discussed here ends up with @xmath34 returning into the outside region @xmath30 . ]",
    "since we can keep @xmath28 , we can rely on eq.([gen ] ) throughout this transformation .",
    "the transformation results in a new wave function @xmath46 @xmath47 %     \\\\ \\nonumber       + \\frac{\\mathcal{r}}{\\varrho}\\ ,      \\exp[i \\varepsilon \\ln ( r-1 ) ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 the important feature of the problem is the discrete symmetry of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it can be expressed as a condition on functions @xmath21 and @xmath46 @xmath49^ * = \\exp(-i\\alpha ) \\phi(r)~ ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a phase , which is not determined by this condition .",
    "the origin and physical meaning of this symmetry are discussed below , see eq.([aa ] ) . meanwhile , to conclude the argument , note that from eqs.([sym]),([nv ] ) one immediately finds that the reflection coefficient @xmath10 satisfies eqs.([rr ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , thus verifying the rh .",
    "it is convenient to look at the presented argument using kruskal @xcite coordinates @xmath50 @xmath51 they are shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] in the conventional form , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "one observes that the rotation over the angle @xmath44 around the point @xmath31 on the complex plane @xmath34 described above leads to the transformation @xmath52 , which brings the point @xmath53 on the kruskal plane in fig .",

    "the direction of time flow in i and iii is opposite .",
    "the incoming particle follows _ ab _ crossing the horizon @xmath57 and residing in ii . the outgoing particle _",
    "cd _ escapes from iv crossing the horizon @xmath58 and coming to i. areas ii and iv are not connected , which ensures classical confinement in ii .",
    "the wave function ( [ gen ] ) ( or ( [ inout ] ) ) describe mixing of events that correspond to incoming and outgoing classical trajectories ( _ ab _ and _ cd _ ) , resulting in phenomena of the reflection on horizon ( rr ) and the escape from the inside region ( ee ) .",
    "the symmetrically located points _ a , a,a  _ are used to reveal the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) of the space - time . the wave function",
    "( [ gen ] ) describes mixing of events corresponding to incoming and outgoing trajectories ( _ ab _ and _ cd _ ) , which results in phenomena of rh and ee .",
    "_ , height=302 ]    the regions i ( @xmath59 ) and iii ( @xmath60 ) of the kruskal plane describe events that take place in the outside world @xcite . these two regions are known to be identical , which provides an opportunity to describe each event in the outside world by one of the two points , either by the one located in the region i , or by the other one located in the region iii .    if some event is described by a point @xmath53 that has the coordinates @xmath50 in the region i , then the point @xmath61 , which represents the same event in the region iii , has the coordinates @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , see fig .",
    "this identification of the points @xmath53 and @xmath61 is particularly transparent in the vicinity of the event horizon that surrounds the internal region ii in which all classical trajectories lead towards the singularity at @xmath36 .",
    "if a particle follows the incoming trajectory in the region i , then it crosses the horizon @xmath64 , which separates the region i from region ii . in this case",
    "the point @xmath53 accounts for an event that happens just before the particle reaches the horizon .",
    "alternatively , one can describe the incoming classical trajectory as the one that leads from the region iii to region ii .",
    "in that case the point @xmath61 shows the event that precipitates the crossing of the horizon , which is located at @xmath65 .",
    "this description is in line with the fact that the motion on the kruskal plane takes place `` from bottom to top . ''    in order to describe this motion one should choose appropriately a variable for the physical time . in the region i the time can be described conventionally , with the help of the variable @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the physical time in the region iii should be described by the variable @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the described properties of the kruskal plane have an important consequence .",
    "since two points @xmath53 and @xmath61 on the kruskal plane describe one and the same event in the physical world , the wave function in these two points must have the same , up to a phase factor , value @xmath69 where notation @xmath70 is used , and the phase @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "equation([aa ] ) represents a simple , but important symmetry condition related to the quantum properties of propagation in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "its origin can be traced to the fact that the full coordinate system necessarily double - covers the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "the kruskal coordinates provide a simple way to implement this fundamental property , though in deriving the symmetry condition eq.([aa ] ) one may rely on any other full system of coordinates .    let us return now to a set of three points @xmath71 shown on the kruskal plane in fig .",
    "[ one ] ; among them @xmath53 is the initial point , while @xmath54 appears after the complex transformation of the variable @xmath34 .",
    "this transformation leaves the time variable @xmath66 intact , therefore at the point @xmath54 we have @xmath72 . having in mind the symmetry condition eq.([aa ] ) , it is desirable to transform the point @xmath54 into @xmath61 .",
    "this transformation amounts simply to the inversion of time because at the point @xmath61 we have @xmath73 ( this inversion of time is in line with the property of the physical time @xmath74 discussed above ) .",
    "the time inversion presumes the complex conjugation of the wave function .",
    "returning now to eq.([sym ] ) one observes that its left - hand side includes the wave function @xmath46 , which can be associated with the event that takes place at the point @xmath54 .",
    "the complex conjugation of this function in eq.([sym ] ) gives another wave function , the one that is associated with the event that happens at the point @xmath61 on the kruskal plane .",
    "the symmetry condition eq.([aa ] ) validates the identity between this later wave function and the initial wave function , which describes the event at the point @xmath53 .    in conclusion , the discrete symmetry of the schwarzschild geometry combined with conventional analytical properties of the wave function validate the rh .",
    "it is convenient to generalize notation in eq.([gen ] ) , presenting the wave function of a particle in the form @xmath75 the first term here describes the wave function that has a conventional , incoming behavior in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "the second term is a wave that has an unexpected , outgoing behavior on the horizon .",
    "the arguments discussed above verified eq.([inout ] ) for the outside region .",
    "importantly , this equation remains valid for the inside region as well .",
    "the proof of this later claim given in @xcite goes along the following lines .",
    "first one recovers the time - dependence of the wave function in eq.([gen ] ) by simply multiplying it by a factor @xmath76 , i. e. writing @xmath77 .",
    "then one uses the kruskal variables eq.([u]),([v ] ) that allow one to present this wave function on the horizon more conveniently , as @xmath78+\\mathcal{r }      \\exp[i\\varepsilon \\ln(u^2)]~.        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the crossing of the horizon between , for example , regions i and ii corresponds to the change of sign of @xmath79 , see fig .",
    "[ one ] . obviously , this change does not affect the general structure of the wave function in eq.([psiuv ] ) that is even in @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this fact makes the methods of derivation of eq.([inout ] ) , which were used above for the outside region , applicable for the inside region as well .",
    "this discussion justifies the fact that the wave function always , including the inside region , has an admixture of the outgoing wave . for particles confined inside the horizon eq.([inout ] ) results in a new , unexpected and interesting phenomenon .",
    "conventional arguments state that a particle that comes inside the horizon would stay inside forever because all classical trajectories for this particle eventually lead to the singularity at @xmath36 . in quantum description",
    "these incoming trajectories correspond to the first term in the wave function in eq.([inout ] ) , which gives the incoming behavior in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "however , the second term in the wave function gives the outgoing behavior on the horizon . in the classical description",
    "this term corresponds to those classical trajectories that lead from the singularity at @xmath36 into the outside world .",
    "the presence of the two terms in the wave function means therefore that the events that describe the incoming particle are necessarily mixed in the wave function with the events that describe the outgoing particle , as was found in @xcite .",
    "simply speaking , the particle confined inside the horizon has a chance to escape into the outside world .",
    "we call this the escape effect ( ee )",
    ".      conventional qualitative explanation for the hawking effect refers to the virtual particle - antiparticle pairs that exist in the vicinity of the horizon due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the strong gravitational field on the horizon is able to separate the pair , bringing one of its components inside the black hole , and allowing the other component to go outside and constitute the flux of outgoing radiation .",
    "the ee provides a different , appealing explanation of the radiation phenomenon .",
    "the radiation happens due to the fact that a particle locked inside the horizon can escape from the confinement into the outside world , creating the flux of outgoing radiation .",
    "the ee is entirely related to the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([psiuv ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the probability that a particle escapes into the outside region is governed by a factor @xmath81 , @xmath82 which looks similar to the probability of the hawking radiation . however , to make this similarity complete , one has to presume that the distribution of particles inside the event horizon is governed by the same hawking temperature .",
    "this condition is satisfied when a black hole is put inside the temperature bath , which has the hawking temperature .",
    "this formulation of the problem was discussed by hartle and hawking @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that for this particular case the flux of radiation that appears due to the ee reproduces the spectrum of a black body with the hawking temperature .",
    "conventionally it is presumed that an outside observer can measure only few characteristics of the black hole , such as its mass , spin and charge .",
    "all other information related to the collapsing matter that created the black hole is supposed to be screened from the outside observer by the event horizon .",
    "thus , presumably the collapse produces large information loss .",
    "however , the wave function eq.([psiuv ] ) indicates that there is the ee , which provides a chance to retrieve the information from within the horizon back into the outside world .    to be specific ,",
    "consider a situation when the usual matter ( made of electrons , protons etc ) collapses producing a black hole .",
    "conventionally it is supposed that for the outside observer this black hole would not look different from a black hole made from the antimatter ( positrons , antiprotons etc ) .",
    "however , the discussion in section [ hawking ] indicates that the radiation of black holes takes place due to the ee .",
    "if the black hole is made of matter , then there are only electrons inside , but there are no positrons . in this case",
    "the outside observer would be able to see the flux of electrons , which escape from the inside region , while there would be no positrons in this spectrum .",
    "from this fact the observer concludes that the black hole is made from conventional matter .",
    "similarly , the outside observer is able to detect other signals that correspond to other characteristics of the collapsed matter , thus retrieving the information hidden inside the horizon .",
    "at this point it is instructive to return back and compare the ee with the phenomenon of the hawking radiation .",
    "there are some similarities . in both cases there",
    "is a flux of radiation due to processes that take place on the horizon , in both cases the exponential function of the ratio of energy to the hawking temperature is present .",
    "however , there are serious distinctions .",
    "the hawking process is often explained via the pair production on the horizon .",
    "this usual and clearly looking physical explanation possesses , though , an intrinsic difficulty .",
    "the component of the pair that goes inside the horizon should possess the negative energy .",
    "this is the only way that allows the black holes to reduce its mass in the process .",
    "this negative energy of the ingoing particle equals @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the positive energy of the outgoing particle .",
    "the point is that @xmath85 is supposed to be the total energy of the ingoing particle , the energy which is conserved , being equal therefore the energy that a particle would possess when located far outside of the black hole .",
    "this energy should definitely be positive .",
    "admitting that it is negative , one makes an assumption , which introduces a difficulty into this physical picture of the hawking radiation .    the ee does not have this problem .",
    "the ee states that a particle is able to escape over the horizon . during this process",
    "its positive energy remains intact .",
    "obviously , when a particle is left , the mass of the black hole becomes smaller .",
    "there is no need in this physical picture to introduce negative energies .",
    "another important feature that distinguishes the ee from the hawking radiation is the actual spectrum of a black hole . for the ee process",
    "it is _ not _ governed by the temperature .",
    "the temperature , as it appears in eq.([p ] ) , is a parameter that has only limited applicability , describing the probability of the escape of the particle from the inside region .",
    "but the flux of the outgoing particles depends also on the probability that particular particles exist inside the horizon . in other words , if there is some particular type of particles inside the horizon , then these particles can escape , giving a contribution to the radiation spectrum . if , however , there are no particles of this particular type inside , then this type of particles does not contribute to the radiation spectrum . accepting this `` limited '' point of view on the temperature , one should ,",
    "probably , also modify the point of view on the entropy and the thermodynamic properties of black holes , but we do not elaborate on this argument here leaving it for further considerations .",
    "the central point of the presented discussion is the claim of refs .",
    "@xcite that the wave function of any particle that approaches a black hole has an admixture which possesses unusual properties , describing the outgoing wave on the horizon .",
    "this important property originates from pure quantum reasons . in the classical approximation",
    "all trajectories cross the horizon smoothly , leaving no opportunity for a particle to switch from the incoming to outgoing trajectory . following the incoming trajectories",
    "all particles inevitably end up in the singularity at @xmath36 .",
    "in contrast , on the quantum level the incoming and outgoing waves are mixed in the wave function on the horizon .",
    "thus , it is impossible to describe the particle in terms of the wave that has only incoming component on the horizon .",
    "the existence of the outgoing wave on the horizon has important and unexpected implications .",
    "one of them is related to the scattering problem .",
    "any particle approaching the black hole can bounce on the horizon back into the outside world . the corresponding effect , called the reflection on the horizon , drastically reduces the absorption cross section in the infrared region @xcite .",
    "another notable phenomenon takes place for the collapsed matter that is confined inside the event horizon .",
    "classically such confinement is absolute , there is no way for a particle to return into the outside world .",
    "the quantum treatment shows that there is such a chance , a particle can escape .",
    "this opportunity was called the escape effect . the probability",
    "that some particle gets away is governed by the exponential factor , which looks very conventional , being dependent on the ratio of the energy of the particle to the hawking temperature . due to this reason",
    "the flux of escaping particles resembles the spectrum of the hawking radiation .",
