    "<S> a novel scalar field free approach to cosmic inflation is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary universe and the radiation dominated universe are shown , within the framework of unified brane cosmology , to be two different phases governed by one and the same energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition of second order ( the hubble constant exhibits a finite jump ) appears naturally and serves as the exit mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> no re - heating is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the required number of e - folds is achieved without fine tuning .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable idea that our universe has undergone , in its very earliest stages of evolution , a phase of exponential expansion@xcite is widely accepted as the solution to the horizon , flatness , and magnetic monopole puzzles . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary universe scenario@xcite , which has gained strong experimental support from the detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation@xcite , is now considered part of the standard hot big bang cosmology . with this in mind , it is highly frustrating that the physical mechanism underlying inflation is essentially obscure . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional ad - hoc theoretical prescription of the inflationary scenario invokes a scalar field of some sort , in analogy to the higgs field introduced in particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> the accompanying potential is carefully engineered to address certain desired features of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear what degrees of freedom are collectively represented by this so - called inflaton , and what actually determines the shape of its model dependent potential . </S>",
    "<S> the beginning and the end the inflationary era are theoretical challenges by themselves , with the major goal being the production of a sufficient number @xmath0 of @xmath1-folds . </S>",
    "<S> while the beginning may resemble a spontaneous creation , by means of quantum nucleation@xcite , the end traditionally occurs once the inflaton starts oscillating around the absolute minimum of the scalar potential .    in this paper , within the framework of unified brane gravity@xcite , we present a novel approach to cosmic inflation . the inflationary universe and the subsequent radiation dominated universe are shown to be two different phases governed by one and the same brane energy density . </S>",
    "<S> it differs from other models of inflation in that it does not involve scalar fields and/or scalar potentials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the model forces the brane energy / momentum tensor , predominantly in the inflationary phase , to consist of radiation and surface tension , which are essential standard cosmological ingredients . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the model offers a natural built - in exit mechanism , implemented by means of a second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the universe exiting the inflationary era is then necessarily radiation dominated and hot . in turn , </S>",
    "<S> no re - heating@xcite is needed , neither as a graceful end of guth s inflation , nor as the arena for recreating matter and fill the universe with radiation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the required number of @xmath1-folds emerges naturally without fine tuning .    </S>",
    "<S> dirac@xcite , in his extensible model of the electron , has paved the way for a consistent brane variation . </S>",
    "<S> he was concerned with the fact that the linearity of the variation may be in jeopardy . </S>",
    "<S> rephrasing dirac , a tiny deformation of the brane corresponding to the brane being pushed a little to the right will not be minus the variation corresponding to the brane being pushed a little ( equally ) to the left , on account of the left and right bulk sections not being a smooth continuation of each other. to bypass the problem , a general curvilinear coordinate system has been invoked , such that in the new so - called dirac frame , _ the location of the brane does not change during the variation process_. imposing dirac s prescription on modern brane theories based on an action principle , such as the collins - holdom@xcite model , which unifies the familiar randall - sundrum@xcite and the dvali - gabadadze - porrati@xcite models , and assuming a discrete @xmath2 symmetry on simplicity grounds , the corresponding brane field equations ( see ref.@xcite for the derivation ) take the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 denote the gravitational coupling constants in the bulk ( brane ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the conventional terms ( the israel@xcite junction term , the einstein tensor associated with the scalar curvature @xmath5 on the brane , and the physical energy - momentum tensor of the brane @xmath6 ) , unified brane gravity gives furthermore rise to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter tensor consists of lagrange multipliers associated with the fundamental induced metric constraint @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proven that @xmath7 is conserved , and that its contraction with the extrinsic curvature vanishes @xmath9 as is evident from the above field equations , @xmath7 serves as a geometrical ( embedding originated ) contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor of the brane , and as such , may have far reaching gravitational consequences . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus crucial to make sure that , although deviating from the rs approach , the gr limit is still there . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological analysis has been shown@xcite to reproduce the gr limit . on top of it , by analyzing the weak field perturbations caused by the presence of matter on the brane , we have already recovered@xcite the 4-dimensional newton force law .    within a cosmological framework , eq.([fieldeq ] ) can be integrated out@xcite , giving rise to a novel constant of integration @xmath10 , the finger print of unified brane cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding frw equation which governs the evolution of the @xmath11-dimensional brane can be conveniently written in the form @xmath12 if the only energy / momentum source in the bulk is a negative cosmological constant @xmath13 , then @xmath14 has been shown@xcite to be a solution of the cubic equation @xmath15 eqs.([frw],[cubic ] ) thus generalize the familiar rs , dgp and ch cosmologies , which are recovered at the @xmath16 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the regge - teitelboim@xcite cordero - vilenkin@xcite stealth universe models are manifest at the @xmath17 limit . like in all brane cosmologies@xcite , it is crucial to notice that @xmath18 defined in eq.([frw ] ) is no longer the physical energy density on the brane , but rather a function of it . </S>",
    "<S> it is @xmath19 which serves as the physical energy density on the brane .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first focus attention on the special case of _ eternal _ inflation , which clearly requires eq.([cubic ] ) to admit an _ </S>",
    "<S> exact _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20-independent solution . </S>",
    "<S> such a solution , conveniently written as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being a constant , as depicted by the straight horizontal ( dashed ) asymptote in fig.([xi ] ) , corresponding to a ( positive by assumption ) cosmological constant @xmath23 may exist for some conventional energy density @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the serendipitous observation now being that @xmath24 must solely consist ( as hinted first in ref.@xcite ) of radiation accompanied by a particular amount of surface tension @xmath25 the no - ghost condition @xmath26 is then naturally adopted .    </S>",
    "<S> counter intuitively , however , even eternal inflation can not last forever in our model . </S>",
    "<S> the slightest deviation of the physical surface tension @xmath27 from the particular @xmath28 value , will expose , as shown in fig.([xi ] ) , the hyperbolic structure of the @xmath14 roots . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of finite inflation , however , is insensitive to the value of @xmath27 .     </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath29 , two roots of cubic eq.([cubic ] ) exhibit a hyperbolic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the intersection point of the two asymptotes ( the straight horizontal one associated with eternal inflation ) sets a natural scale for terminating inflation . ]    the intersection point of the two asymptotes ( the straight one is associated with eternal inflation ) , as determined directly from eq.([cubic ] ) , with eq.([rho ] ) imposed , sets a natural frw scale @xmath30 for terminating inflation , namely @xmath31 the early universe cosmological constant @xmath32 is also not sensitive to the value of the surface tension @xmath27 . in fact , on realistic grounds ( to be revealed soon ) , @xmath28 will be traded for the randall - sundrum surface tension @xmath33 with the price being a finite , yet sufficient , amount of radiation driven inflation .    at very short scale factors </S>",
    "<S> , the situation may appear to be confusing . </S>",
    "<S> while the energy density @xmath24 clearly explodes as @xmath34 , the effective energy density @xmath18 stays finite in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> what this means is that , in the absence of an ultra - violet cutoff ( included in particular is the @xmath35 flat case ) , the inflationary era can in fact start at an arbitrarily small scale . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the total number of @xmath1-folds can become arbitrarily large . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , @xmath36 will mark the edge of validity ( set by the planck scale ) of our classical field equations . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath37 , on the other hand , the cosmological scale factor marking the entrance of inflation gets fixed by @xmath38 . interpreted as spontaneous creation of a closed baby universe , such an entrance </S>",
    "<S> is presumably governed by hawking - hartle@xcite no - boundary proposal , or alternatively , by davidson - karasik - lederer@xcite brane nucleation .    </S>",
    "<S> a great number of physical processes may occur during the later stages of cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> one of which , for example , reflecting the fact that the massive particles have eventually cooled down , is the appearance of a dust term @xmath39 in the energy / momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> our interest is focused , however , on the early universe exiting the inflationary era , and not on the very late universe . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , it remains to be seen whether radiation driven inflation , based on @xmath40 is capable of spontaneously inducing an exit mechanism , and whether the emerging universe happens to correspond to the physical one we know of . </S>",
    "<S> if we insist on @xmath41 , to assure a positive newton s constant at the general relativistic limit ( as well as brane stability ) , the cubic eq.([cubic ] ) admits three real roots such that @xmath42 as @xmath43 . only the largest of these roots , namely @xmath44 is capable of supporting an adjustably tiny cosmological constant @xmath45 , as required by the present universe ( the other two roots lead to a negative and a positive definite @xmath46 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally calls for the familiar randall - sundrum fine - tuning of the surface tension , given by eq.([simgmars ] ) , with the subsequent collins - holdom identification@xcite of newton s constant @xmath47 to probe the nature of the universe at the post inflationary era , we expand @xmath48 to learn that it is radiation dominated @xmath49 provided the enhancement factor ( in parentheses ) is positive .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , an apparent contradiction is encountered . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , inflation has been shown to single out the @xmath50 branch at the small-@xmath20 regime , whereas it is the @xmath48 branch which is required for the large-@xmath20 regime . </S>",
    "<S> one must thus closely follow the time evolution of the three roots , with the frw scale factor serving as the evolution parameter . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the role of a finite @xmath20 is to add the linear piece @xmath51 to the asymptotic ( @xmath43 ) expression of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> there are four cases to examine , corresponding to the different regions on the @xmath53-axis where @xmath54 can be located . </S>",
    "<S> a careful analysis reveals that ( i ) there is no @xmath10 for which @xmath14 would analytically evolve from @xmath55 at small-@xmath20 to @xmath48 at large-@xmath20 , ( ii ) there exists a range of parameters , namely @xmath56 for which @xmath55 at small-@xmath20 _ must _ connect with @xmath48 at large-@xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection is established by means of a second order phase transition , and ( iii ) within the above range , the radiation enhancement factor in eq.([radiation ] ) is positive , in fact @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the exiting universe is thus _ necessarily _ radiation dominated .     </S>",
    "<S> the roots @xmath14 of the cubic equation </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 serve to express the effective energy density @xmath18 as a function of the physical energy density @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> responding to the finite jump @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 , the universe undergoes an inflation @xmath60 radiation domination phase transition . ]    </S>",
    "<S> plotted in fig.([polynomial ] ) , with @xmath20 serving as the parameter , is the master cubic polynomial @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the frw scale factor is sub - critical , that is @xmath62 , there exist three real solutions , the central of which @xmath55 is recognized as the inflation oriented solution . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath20 approaches criticality , @xmath55 and @xmath63 merge , and are about to mutually disappear ( becoming complex ) as @xmath20 crosses the @xmath64 barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the only left over real solution is then @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> responding to the finite jump @xmath65 , the universe undergoes a second order phase transition . while the frw scale factor @xmath66 remains continuous , the ( positive ) hubble constant exhibits a sudden _ finite increase _ </S>",
    "<S> ( note that @xmath67 when nearing @xmath68 from below ) . as in any phase transition in physics </S>",
    "<S> , however , it is expected that fluctuations will smoothen the jump ( @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective energy / momentum tensor is characterized by a typical critical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> expanding near ( below ) the critical point , one finds @xmath70 for some positive constants @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is the corresponding effective pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the effective energy density @xmath18 , characterized by a finite jump at the critical scale , is plotted in fig.([rhoeff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the graph ( not necessarily its physics ) highly reminds us of the specific heat as a function of @xmath73 ( which in fact is the scale factor ) in @xmath74-transition of liquid helium . at any rate , </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath20 keeps growing in the radiation dominated phase , one will face once again three real roots , but this time for a change , real @xmath48 is never lost . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to remark that , due to the hysteresis - like nature of the evolution , time reversibility is not respected . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> a shrinking radiation dominated universe will _ not _ undergo deflation .     </S>",
    "<S> the early universe phase transition , connecting the inflationary ( @xmath75 ) and the radiation dominated ( @xmath76 ) eras , is characterized by a finite jump in the hubble constant @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the two phases share the one and the same physical energy density @xmath78 . ]    to estimate the total number @xmath79 of @xmath1-folds generated by radiation driven inflation , one needs to calculate the critical value @xmath64 of the frw scale factor . on simplicity grounds ( nothing to do with fine tuning ) , let us do it in the limit where @xmath10 approaches the right edge of the physically allowed range specified by eq.([range ] ) , that is for @xmath80 , which is fully equivalent to setting @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple limit is characterized by the fact that the two branches @xmath63 and @xmath55 intersect , with the intersection point serving as the origin of a local hyperbolic structure generated once @xmath10 deviates from the limit value . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now claim that , up to the @xmath45 fixing , which is a severe fine - tuning problem by itself , our model is free of the conventional inflation - oriented fine - tuning . to address the naturalness issue of the various ratios in the theory </S>",
    "<S> , we define the dimensionless positive constant @xmath84 combining the entrance and exit scales , we can estimate the total number of @xmath1-folds , and find @xmath85 it is customary to associate the entrance with the planck scale ( the alternative being the gut scale ) , that is @xmath86 , and further require , taking into account today s relative suppression of radiation versus matter densities , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes today s critical energy density . </S>",
    "<S> this brings us to the region around @xmath89 although the result is not that sensitive to the value of @xmath90 ( for example , changing @xmath90 by a factor of hundred will only contribute @xmath91 ) , it is fully consistent with @xmath90 being roughly @xmath92 , thus emphasizing the naturalness of radiation driven inflation    to summarize , the general idea of radiation driven inflation may seem to be self contradictory at the first glance . </S>",
    "<S> after all , it takes a deviation from general relativity to allow the physical energy density @xmath24 , stemming from the brane matter lagrangian , to differ from @xmath18 , the effective source of the frw geometry . within the framework of unified brane gravity </S>",
    "<S> , the interplay of these two energy densities is taken one step beyond the randall - sundram model , when noticing that @xmath93 actually dictates @xmath94 at small scales ( note that at such small scales all particles , massive as well , would be ultra relativistic and thus radiation like ) . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the door for the fascinating possibility that the inflationary universe and the subsequent radiation dominated universe are in fact two different phases governed by one and the same physical energy / momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , unlike other models of inflation , brane inflation models included , the present one does not invoke ad hoc scalar fields . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the universe must have been hot before as well as after the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> no re - heating is thus in order . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , notice that unlike in early models of inflation , @xmath95 and hence the number of @xmath1-folds does not depend here on initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , since a scalar potential is not a part of our theory , conditions such as starting almost at rest at the top of the hill and slow - roll are irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , up to the usual @xmath45 , radiation driven inflation is fine - tuning free . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , a number of theoretical questions are still to be addressed in our inflation model , most notably the issue of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is crucial to understand the behavior of the matter fields under such a transition . </S>",
    "<S> the research of fluctuations is also in order . as in any phase transition in physics </S>",
    "<S> , one expects the fluctuations to create `` islands '' of the second phase , that tend to expand and eventually consume the entire universe , thereby `` smoothening '' the phase transition . </S>"
