    "pre - main - sequence stars derive their luminosity from the gravitational contraction they experience prior to hydrogen ignition . within the hr diagram",
    ", they descend evolutionary tracks that start from the birthline and end at the zero - age main sequence .",
    "although these objects emit vigorous winds and undergo disk accretion , especially at earlier times , the net change in mass during the contraction phase appears to be relatively small ( e.g. , hartmann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus , it is still appropriate to consider the ensemble of tracks parametrized by the stellar mass .",
    "the masses and ages derived by placing stars on the tracks are fundamental data , not only for characterizing individual objects , but for assessing the mass distribution and history of formation activity within clusters and associations . following the initial calculations of the 1960s ,",
    "cohen & kuhi ( 1979 ) compiled a set of tracks that were used for many years .",
    "swenson et al . ( 1994 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) then offered new sets that utilized different phenomenological theories of convection .",
    "these later results not only differed substantially from each other , but also led to problematic distributions of stellar masses and ages ( e.g. green & meyer 1995 ; hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "a number of authors have reinvestigated the problem , in part to resolve these differences ( martn & claret 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ; baraffe et al . 1998 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1998 ; siess et al .",
    "1999 ) . our own recent calculation (",
    "palla & stahler 1999 ) utilized standard mixing - length theory for convection , along with modern determinations of the equation of state and low - temperature opacities .",
    "how are we to gauge the accuracy of pre - main - sequence tracks ?",
    "one test is the position of the birthline , i.e. , the upper envelope to the distribution of pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "stahler ( 1983 ) first predicted this locus theoretically by combining a protostellar mass - radius relationship with the cohen & kuhi tracks .",
    "palla & stahler ( 1990 ) then extended the curve into the regime of intermediate - mass objects .",
    "thus far , the predicted birthline does seem to match the observed envelopes in both t associations and groups containing herbig ae / be stars ( e.g. , chen et al .",
    "1997 ; van den ancker et al . 1998 ; luhman 1999 ) .",
    "this result attests to the essential validity of both protostar theory ( leading to the mass - radius relation ) and the pre - main - sequence tracks themselves .    for a more precise check",
    ", one should compare the stellar masses obtained using the tracks with those that can be derived empirically . on the observational side ,",
    "there has been some attempt to derive masses from spectroscopically determined surface gravities ( macnamara 1975 ; 1976 ) , but the precision of the latter is rather poor .",
    "bonnell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested using the infall speed of circumstellar matter , as gauged from the redshifted absorption of selected emission lines .",
    "the presumption here is that the detected motion occurs along magnetic flux tubes linking the inner edge of a disk to the stellar surface .",
    "quantitatively , however , one faces not only the problem of geometric projection along field lines of unknown topology , but also the complication that the physical velocities may not be truly free - fall .",
    "the most reliable technique is to use _ rotational _ speeds . here",
    ", one may employ the radial velocities of spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. , lee 1992 ) , or else molecular - line observations of disks around binaries ( white et al . 1998 ) or single stars ( simon et al . 2000 ) .    in this paper , we employ both spectroscopic binaries and circumbinary disks to gauge the accuracy of our own pre - main - sequence tracks .",
    "we begin , in  ii below , by verifying the endpoints of these tracks , through observations of main - sequence systems .",
    "we then consider , in  iii , a number of younger pairs .",
    "we focus initially on eclipsing , spectroscopic binaries , for which individual masses can be obtained with high accuracy .",
    "we analyze several systems that contain at least one pre - main - sequence member .",
    "mass ratios , as opposed to individual values , are available for double - lined spectroscopic binaries , from the relative amplitudes of the individual velocity curves . this ratio may be compared with pre - main - sequence theory , provided one can also assess the luminosities and effective temperatures of the binary components .",
    "we finally consider the special case of gg tau , where combined stellar masses can be derived from the rotational velocity of the circumbinary disk .    our conclusion , as presented in ",
    "iv , is that the pre - main - sequence tracks in question are indeed reliable , in the sense that they generally predict masses or mass ratios in excellent agreement with empirical values .",
    "moreover , we find that the derived ages within a pair are usually very similar .",
    "close binaries thus appear to be coeval , a tendency already adduced for wider systems ( hartigan et al .",
    "1994 ; brandner & zinnecker 1997 ) .",
    "we find two anomalous systems , ntts  162814@xmath02427 and p1540 , for which both the mass ratios and ages seem discrepant .",
    "the fault , we suggest , lies in the determination of the surface temperatures and luminosities , a conclusion reinforced by other observations .",
    "binary stars have traditionally been the main source of accurate stellar masses and radii , and are employed to calibrate the mass - dependence of the main sequence ( andersen 1991 ) .",
    "most useful in this regard are the detached , double - lined , eclipsing systems . here",
    ", one exploits both the radial velocity and light curves to obtain not only the masses of the individual components , but also their luminosities and effective temperatures .",
    "figure 1 shows a portion of our pre ",
    "main - sequence tracks in the hr diagram , with masses from 0.1 to 1.2 @xmath4 . toward the upper end",
    "we have placed the components of two eclipsing systems with primaries of roughly solar mass , ew ori and hs aur .",
    "it is evident that the measured luminosities and effective temperatures indeed place all four stars close to the end of our tracks . from table 1 of andersen ( 1991 ) ,",
    "the masses of the ew ori components are 1.19 and 1.16 @xmath4 . for comparison , the interpolation from our tracks yields values of 1.14 and 1.11 @xmath4 , respectively . for hs aur ,",
    "the measured masses are 0.90 and 0.88 @xmath4 , while our tracks give corresponding values of 0.94 and 0.90 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the number of known systems with lower - mass components diminishes rapidly . until recently",
    ", there were only two observed eclipsing binaries with subsolar primaries , yy gem and cm dra .",
    "the latter has a metallicity from a third to half of solar ( leggett et al .",
    "2000 ) , and thus can not be studied using our tracks .",
    "( for the effect of reduced metallicity on evolutionary tracks of low - mass stars , see , e.g. , dantona & mazzitelli 1998 , siess et al . 2000 ) .",
    "delfosse et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have discovered a third system , gj 2609 , a quadruple whose more massive component is itself an eclipsing binary .",
    "no estimates for effective temperature are yet available .",

    "we display the positions of both components in figure 1 .",
    "note the large uncertainties in effective temperature , a well recognized problem at these masses ( allard et al .",
    "our adopted t@xmath6-values for yy gem ( 3806 and 3742 k ) come from chabrier & baraffe ( 1995 ) . these nominal values , together with the measured luminosities , again place the stars close to , but not precisely at the ends of our tracks .",
    "our inferred masses , 0.57 and 0.49 @xmath4 for yy gem are also discrepant than for solar - mass systems , although the error is still under 20% percent .",
    "such declining accuracy at the lowest masses is expected , as our models lack the refined equation of state and atmosphere calculations needed for accurate treatment in this regime ( eg , chabrier & baraffe 1995 ) .",
    "this eclipsing , double - lined spectroscopic binary belongs to the recently discovered open cluster @xmath7 cha .",
    "the group itself contains about 50 members , and lies at a distance of just 97  pc ( mamajek et al .",

    "although this value is very close to unity , we have included the system in our sample because its eclipses allow accurate determination of individual masses .",

    "this object should therefore be pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone .",

    "both systems lie in regions of the hr diagram where the tracks are especially crowded , so that modest changes in effective temperature translate into large mass shifts .",
    "the overall agreement between theoretical and empirical ratios is good , but there is a systematic drift from unity for higher - mass systems .",
    "we attribute this trend to the difficulty in determining the secondary properties when the primary is a luminous , massive star . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not considered the effect of convective overshooting , which could be an important physical process to include in more realistic models of higher - mass stars ( e.g. , ribas et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have also obtained absolute mass values for the sample of stars recently investigated by simon et al .",
    "these authors used interferometric , molecular - line observations of disks around 9 stars in taurus - auriga . assuming the disks to be in keplerian motion",
    ", they were able to ascertain the masses of the central objects .",
    "we have placed all these objects in the hr diagram , and find masses that agree with those of simon et al .",
    "to within 8  percent . two exceptions , where we find substantially lower mass - values , are the single star bp  tau and the binary uz  tau . in both cases ,",
    "the molecular - line observations are problematic , as discussed in detail by simon et al .",
    "an interesting dividend from our study is the determination of contraction ages for each object above the zams . as seen in the lower panel of figure 4",
    ", there is a remarkably close match between the ages of the primary and secondary star within each binary .",
    "we stress that there is no reason _ a priori _ to expect such agreement , and there is no generally accepted theory of binary formation that predicts coevality .",
    "nevertheless , our finding extends the important , earlier investigations by hartigan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and brandner & zinnecker ( 1997 ) , which demonstrated a similar trend in visual binaries .",
    "the implication of all these studies is that the individual components of binaries are born _ in situ _ at the same time , regardless of their eventual configuration .",
    "now the widest pre - main - sequence binaries have separations of order @xmath77  au ( e.g. , mathieu 1994 ) , a distance comparable to the sizes of dense cloud cores ( myers & benson 1983 ) .",
    "it is an attractive hypothesis , therefore , that both components form through protostellar collapse within the same cloud fragment .",
    "a question of key importance for theory is how the structure and evolution of these molecular structures promotes simultaneous density buildup in at least two internal locations .",
    "returning to the stellar mass determinations , the tally of double - lined spectroscopic binaries is richer than that studied here .",
    "we have omitted a number of systems with mass ratios very close to unity , since they do not provide stringent tests on the accuracy of our tracks .",
    "these binaries include dq  tau ( @xmath781.03 ; mathieu et al .",
    "1997 ) , w134 ( @xmath781.04 , padgett & stapelfeldt 1994 ) , and v826  tau ( @xmath781.02 , lee et al . 1994 ) . adopting the quoted luminosities and temperatures for each star",
    ", we concur that the component masses all match to within 10  percent . we have also omitted the equal - mass , eclipsing binary gg ori in the orion ob1 association .",
    "our mass estimate of @xmath79 for each component is very close to the value of @xmath80 found by torres et al .",
    "finally , we have not analyzed rxj 0529.4 + 0041 , an eclipsing binary in the orion ob1a subgroup ( covino et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the measured masses are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , but the luminosity and temperature of the secondary are not yet firmly established .",
    "our own value for the primary mass is @xmath83 , in close agreement with the observational finding .",
    "our study by no means represents a thorough empirical test of pre - main - sequence tracks .",
    "future investigations would do well to concentrate on lower - mass stars , and on systems with larger mass ratios than those considered here .",
    "as we have discussed , the largest uncertainties in modeling are for objects near the brown dwarf limit .",
    "traditional studies of spectroscopic binaries have also emphasized nearly equal - mass systems , simply because of the practical difficulty in detecting a relatively dim companion .",
    "this purely observational bias has misled theorists considering the question of binary origin ( e.g. , boss 1988 , 1993 ) .",
    "recently , mazeh et al . ( 2000 ) have stressed the utility of near - infrared observations for ascertaining the properties of lower - mass secondaries . with a wider range of binary systems in hand",
    ", we may look forward to a more complete assessment of current pre - main - sequence tracks , and to the eventual refinement of the underlying theory .",
    "we are grateful to e.  covino , s.  shore , and h.  zinnecker for very useful discussions on young binaries .",
    "we also thank the referee , i. baraffe , for a very thoughtful report .",
    "the funding of f.  p. was partially supplied by asi grant ars  98 - 116 to the osservatorio di arcetri .",
    "support for s.  s. was through nsf grant ast-9987266 .",
    "this work has made extensive use of the simbad and ads data bases .",
