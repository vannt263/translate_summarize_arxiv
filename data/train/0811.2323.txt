    "the trace distance is one of the most natural distance measures used in quantum - information theory @xcite .",
    "it is one of the main tools used in distinguishability theory and it is connected to the average success probability when distinguishing two states by a measurement @xcite .",
    "it is also related to quantum fidelity , which provides the measure of similarity of two quantum states @xcite .",
    "both quantities are particularly important in quantum cryptography , since the security of quantum protocols relies on an ability to measure the distance between two quantum states @xcite .",
    "the trace distance is also related to other properties of quantum states like the von neumann entropy and relative entropy  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this work is to provide a lower bound for the trace distance using measurable quantities .",
    "we use nonlinear functions of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are density matrices . for such forms there exist feasible schemes to measure them in an experiment without resorting to state tomography @xcite .",
    "we give a lower bound based on the superfidelity introduced recently in @xcite .",
    "proof of this bound gives an answer to the conjecture stated by mendonca _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath3 the space of density matrices acting on @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 . for two density matrices",
    "@xmath6 the trace distance is defined as @xmath7 in the particular case of pure states we can use bloch vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "one can see that the trace distance between such states is equal to half of the euclidean distance between the respective bloch vectors @xmath10    the trace distance can be bounded with the use of the fidelity  @xcite @xmath11 where the fidelity is defined as @xmath12 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the inequality ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) shows that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are closely related indicators of distinguishability .",
    "the main result of this work is a lower bound for the trace distance , which we prove in the next section , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is called the _ superfidelity _ , and was introduced in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath17 it is defined as @xmath18 from the matrix analytic perspective the inequality ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) relates the trace norm on the space @xmath3 to the hilbert - schmidt scalar product on @xmath3 . for the sake of consistency we provide basic information about the superfidelity  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of superfidelity is that it provides an upper bound for quantum fidelity  @xcite @xmath19    the superfidelity also has properties which make it useful for quantifying the distance between quantum states .",
    "in particular we have : ( 1 ) bounds : @xmath20 .",
    "( 2 ) symmetry : @xmath21 . ( 3 ) unitary invariance : for any unitary operator @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 . ( 4 ) concavity : @xmath24 for any @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] . ( 5 ) supermultiplicativity : for @xmath27 we have @xmath28    note that the superfidelity shares properties 1 - 4 with the fidelity . however , in contrast to the fidelity , superfidelity is not multiplicative , but supermultiplicative .",
    "in @xcite the authors showed that @xmath16 is _ jointly _ concave in its two arguments , @xmath29 for @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "note that the property of joint concavity is obeyed by the square root of fidelity @xmath30 , but not by the fidelity ( [ eqn : fid ] ) .",
    "fidelity can be used to define the metric @xmath31 on the space @xmath3 as @xmath32 unfortunately the analog of the bures distance defined using the superfidelity @xmath33 is not a metric @xcite , but the quantity @xmath34 provides the metric on the space @xmath3 .",
    "finally one should note that the superfidelity is particularly convenient to use as the practical measure of similarity between quantum states .",
    "one of the main advantages of superfidelity is that it is possible to design feasible schemes to measure it in an experiment @xcite .",
    "also , from the computational point of view , calculation of the superfidelity is significantly less resource - consuming @xcite .",
    "the properties of superfidelity listed above suggest that it would be convenient to use it instead of fidelity to draw conclusions about the distinguishability of quantum states .",
    "this section show how this can be done by relating the superfidelity and trace distance .",
    "first we can observe that from the inequality @xmath35 and since we have ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) we get that @xmath36 our main aim is to prove the following inequality , which provides tighter bound .",
    "[ conjecture - general ] for any @xmath6 we have @xmath37 or equivalently @xmath38    this inequality was first stated as a conjecture in @xcite , where it was verified numerically for small dimensions .",
    "clearly it is motivated by the lower bound for trace distance provided by the inequality ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) .    to prove the theorem [ conjecture - general ] we need the following lemma .    for any @xmath6 let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the projectors onto @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "we have the following inequalities @xmath43    _ proof .  _ because of the similarity we will show only inequality ( [ ineq:1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to prove inequalities ( [ ineq:2 ] ) , ( [ ineq:3 ] ) and ( [ ineq:4 ] ) in a similar manner .",
    "we subtract the right- from the left - side of ( [ ineq:1 ] ) to get @xmath44 because @xmath45 is positive semidefinite .",
    "@xmath46    _ proof of theorem [ conjecture - general ] .",
    "_ adding the inequalities ( [ ineq:1 ] ) and ( [ ineq:2 ] ) we get @xmath47 similarly , by adding inequalities ( [ ineq:3 ] ) and ( [ ineq:4 ] ) we get @xmath48 now we notice that , if two non - negative numbers are greater than the third one , then so is the geometric mean of the first two numbers . using this fact we combine ( [ eqn : l1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : l2 ] ) to get @xmath49 on the other hand we can rewrite the trace distance with the use of projectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 now finally we can write @xmath53 which is equivalent to ( [ eqn : conjecture - general ] ) . @xmath46",
    "it is natural to consider the relation between the lower bounds in ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) and ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) .",
    "it is clear that bound ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is better than ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) whenever @xmath54 .    in the one qubit case or",
    "if one of the states is pure the bound ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is always better than ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) .",
    "this follows from the equality between fidelity and superfidelity in these situations  @xcite . on the other hand the inequality ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) provides a better lower bound if the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 have orthogonal supports . in this case",
    "the fidelity between states vanishes , but the superfidelity is not necessarily equal to zero  @xcite .",
    "to get some feeling about the difference between the bound given by fidelity and the present bound we will consider the following families of states .    1 .   the family @xmath57 is defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a pure state and in our case we take @xmath60 .",
    "the family @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the family @xmath64 is defined as : @xmath65     calculated for states ( [ eqn : ex - states ] ) and maximally mixed states as a function of the dimension @xmath4 and the parameter @xmath66 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ex - states ] ) ] . ]     calculated for states ( [ eqn : ex - states ] ) and ( [ eqn : ex - states - dim4 ] ) as a function of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : low - bound - diff ] we consider the family @xmath57 and calculate the difference @xmath68 .",
    "one can see that for small dimensions and states close to the pure state @xmath59 the superfidelity gives a much better approximation for the trace distance than the fidelity . for larger dimensions",
    "this is not the case , but nevertheless we can observe that still the superfidelity provides a better bound .",
    "this advantage is lost for states close to the maximally mixed state .",
    "a similar situation can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : low - bound - diff - dim4 ] where the difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is presented . for this particular family",
    "the bound ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is better than ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) , but the difference vanishes for states close to the maximally mixed state .     calculated for states ( [ eqn : ex - states ] ) and ( [ eqn : ex - states - k3 ] ) ( @xmath72 ) as the function of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath73 .",
    "solid line is a border that separates two regions . for the parameters in lighter one the inequality ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) provides better bound , while in darker region the inequality ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is better . ]",
    "unfortunately , the bound ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is not always tighter when compared with ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff - levels ] shows the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath72 ) . as one can see for this family of states there are regions for which the bound ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) is better than ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) but in this case for highly mixed states ( [ eqn : fid - dtr - ineq ] ) is better than ( [ eqn : main - ineq ] ) .",

    "this shows that superfidelity can be used to conclude about the distinguishablity of states .",
    "our bound provides the relation between the trace distance and the overlap of two operators supplementary to inequality from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.1 ) . as such it provides neat mathematical tool which can be used in quantum information theory .",
