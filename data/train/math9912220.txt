    "@xcite and references cited therein ) one typically deals just with the case where @xmath21 is a selfadjoint operator in a hilbert space or a symmetric operator admitting a selfadjoint closure .    the second condition in ( [ inicond ] ) yields that the product @xmath22 is a bounded linear operator .",
    "it follows that @xmath23 has a bounded extension @xmath24 to the whole space @xmath5 .",

    "we call @xmath31 the transfer function associated with the operator matrix @xmath20 .",
