    "non - linear sigma models in 1 + 1 dimensions play an important role in several areas of theoretical and mathematical physics , see e.g. @xcite for a review .",
    "they become accessible to analytical methods in particular when the target manifold is a coset manifold ( maximally symmetric ) , such as @xmath4 .",
    "this model by construction has a manifest internal @xmath2-symmetry as well as further hidden symmetries that make it integrable .",
    "its target space is the riemannian manifold @xmath5 , and its internal symmetry group is compact .",
    "string theory is closely related to non - linear sigma models , where the target space comes into play as the spacetime in which the strings propagate .",
    "often , it is assumed to be of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a suitable compact riemannian manifold representing the @xmath8 extra dimensions to have certain well - known special values , depending whether or not one includes fermions .",
    "we will not consider such symmetries in this paper , so in this sense the connection to string theory is not a direct one . ] .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason not to consider more general target spaces where not just the extra dimensions are curved .",
    "for instance , it seems natural to consider target spaces such as desitter spacetime @xmath9 , which , like the sphere , is a coset manifold ( maximally symmetric space ) .",
    "this type of non - linear sigma model would be expected to have an internal @xmath1-symmetry ( which is not compact ) together , perhaps , with further hidden symmetries by analogy with the @xmath2 non - linear sigma model .    to exploit the hidden symmetries , say , in the @xmath2-model",
    ", one may take advantage of the fact that its scattering matrix must be factorizing . in combination with the internal @xmath2 symmetry , natural assumptions about the `` particle spectrum '' ( basically the representation of @xmath2 ) , hints from perturbation theory , and the highly constraining relations imposed by crossing symmetry , yang - baxter relation , analyticity , etc .",
    ", one can often guess the form of the 2-body scattering matrix , which then consistently determines the @xmath8-body scattering matrix @xcite . in order to derive from such a scattering matrix quantities associated with the local operators of the theory",
    ", one can for example follow the bootstrap - form factor program  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this program is to determine the matrix elements of local operators between in- and out - states ( form factors ) , which are found using the scattering matrix and various a priori assumptions about the form factors .",
    "the program is largely successful but runs into technical difficulties when attempting to compute higher correlation functions in terms of the form factors , or , indeed , when trying to even show that the corresponding series converge .",
    "an alternative approach is to construct the operator algebras generated by the local quantum fields by abstract methods ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the input is again the scattering matrix , but the procedure is rather different .",
    "first , one constructs certain half - local generator fields .",
    "these `` left local fields '' @xmath10 play an auxiliary role and are constructed in such a way that with each of them , there is an associated `` right local field '' @xmath11 such that @xmath12=0 $ ] if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are space like related points in 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski space _ and _ @xmath14 is to the right of @xmath13 in a relativistic sense .",
    "we will actually work with a similar construction for a `` chiral half '' of a massless theory on a lightray , where @xmath15 = 0 $ ] if @xmath16 with @xmath17 lightray coordinates @xcite .",
    "both on two - dimensional minkowski space and in the chiral lightray setting , the left and right local fields generate left and right local operator algebras , and suitable intersections of these algebras then contain the truly local fields @xcite .",
    "the latter are thereby characterized rather indirectly , and indeed , the local fields do not have a simple expression in terms of the auxiliary semi - local objects , but rather reproduce the full complexity of the form factor expansion @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we will show that such constructions also work for non - compact target spaces such as @xmath18 .",
    "since the internal symmetry group , @xmath1 , is non - compact , its non - trivial unitary representations must necessarily be infinite - dimensional .",
    "this is an obvious major difference , say , to the @xmath2-model , where the basic representation under which the single particle states transform is the fundamental representation , which is finite ( @xmath19- ) dimensional . despite this difference",
    ", one may proceed and ask whether the algebraic method can be generalized to non - compact groups such as @xmath1 . for this ,",
    "one first needs a 2-body scattering matrix ( or rather , an `` @xmath1-invariant yang - baxter operator '' , see sect .",
    "[ subsection : invariant - yb - ops ] ) satisfying suitable properties such as yang - baxter - relation , crossing symmetry , analyticity , unitarity , etc . in turns out that the precise algebraic and analytic properties required to make the method work are related to each other in a rather intricate way , and one does not , a priori , see an obvious way to generate simple solutions to the requirements .",
    "one result of our paper is to provide such a yang - baxter operator for the spin-@xmath20 principal , complementary and discrete series representations of @xmath1 in sect .",
    "[ section : ybops - lorentzgroup ] .",
    "this is facilitated by using an invariant geometrical description of the corresponding representations due to bros , epstein , and moschella  @xcite ( sect .",
    "[ section : uir - lorentzgroup ] ) . our yang - baxter operator @xmath0 can hence be used to define left- and right half - local operator algebras for this model , as we show in a general framework in sect .",
    "[ section : crossing ] , and as concrete models in sect .",
    "[ subsection : chiral - models ] .",
    "if it could be shown that suitable intersections of such algebras are sufficiently large , then this would indeed correspond to ( a chiral half of ) a local 1 + 1 dimensional field theory describing , in some sense , the quantized left ( or right- ) movers of a non - linear sigma model with non - compact target space .",
    "the group @xmath1 is not just the isometry group of @xmath21-dimensional desitter spacetime @xmath18 , but also the conformal isometry group of @xmath22-dimensional _ euclidean _ flat space @xmath3 .",
    "this dual role becomes geometrically manifest if one attaches a pair of conformal boundaries @xmath23 to @xmath18 .",
    "each of these boundaries is isometric to a round sphere @xmath24 , which in turn may be viewed as a 1-point conformal compactification of @xmath3 via the stereographic projection .",
    "the induced action of @xmath1 by this chain of identifications provides the action of the conformal group on @xmath3 .",
    "this well - known correspondence is at the core of the so - called `` ds / cft - correspondence / conjecture ''  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this correspondence is that with the pair of infinities @xmath23 there is associated a pair of euclidean conformal field theories .",
    "one way to see this is that unitary representations of @xmath1 do not correspond to unitary representations of @xmath25 via `` analytic continuation '' @xcite . ] acted upon by @xmath1 . on the other hand , with the `` bulk '' @xmath18 ,",
    "there is associated a corresponding `` string - theory '' with internal symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "the action of the group essentially connects these two theories .    inspired by this circle of ideas",
    ", one might be tempted to ask whether one can , in our setup , also naturally construct a euclidean conformal field theory on @xmath3 associated with our sigma models with target space @xmath18 .",
    "we will demonstrate in the course of this article that this is indeed the case . in our approach ,",
    "the core datum is a 2-body scattering matrix / yang - baxter operator @xmath0 . in section  [ euclqft ]",
    "we will outline an abstract procedure how to obtain a corresponding euclidean conformal field theory from such an object .",
    "thus , within our framework , there is a sense in which the essentially algebraic quantity @xmath0 can relate a euclidean conformal field theory in @xmath22 dimensions and a kind of `` string theory '' in @xmath21-dimensional desitter target space , and thereby gives a model for the ds / cft correspondence .",
    "that correspondence manifests itself more concretely as follows in our construction .",

    "the idea is that the desired correspondence ( duality ) maps the states created by the operators @xmath41   to the states created by the operators @xmath42   in the `` continuum limit '' @xmath43 .",

    "this gives @xmath810 and after an inverse fourier transformation , we arrive at @xmath811 using the definitions of @xmath371 and @xmath785 , the desired equality then follows .",
    "we must also check the analyticity and boundedness of the @xmath48 factors in the definition of @xmath328 and @xmath371 .",
    "these follow from the well - known facts that @xmath48 is non - vanishing , has poles at the non - positive integers , and the standard asymptotic formula ( @xmath812 ) |(x+iy)|",
    "~(2)^  |y|^x- e^-|y|/2  .",
    "it follows that the @xmath48 factors are bounded by @xmath813 for large @xmath814 .",
    "the @xmath38-dependence of coming from the exponentials is analytic @xmath38 once we form the matrix elements of @xmath33 , and these exponentials are also clearly bounded in @xmath38 .",
    "if we take matrix elements with smooth wave functions , we get from these factors decay as @xmath815 where @xmath8 is as large as we wish .",
    "thus , all pieces in @xmath33 are analytic in the strip @xmath780 and decay faster than any inverse power @xmath815 for @xmath816 if we take matrix elements with smooth wave functions .    to derive the infinite product formula for @xmath817 quoted in is rather lengthy , and we only sketch the main steps .",
    "first , we expand the digamma functions in the definition of @xmath818 using the well - known series ( z ) = -_e + _ n=0^ ( - )  . substituting this series for each of the terms in the expression   for @xmath818 , we find that all contributions from euler s constant @xmath819 and from the sums over @xmath820 cancel each other .",
    "we next calculate @xmath821 by performing the integral over @xmath822 separately for each term in the series ( this is admissible , because both the series and the integral are absolutely convergent ) .",
    "the resulting integrals all have the form _ -^dt   = -  e^-(n+)|p|  , where the residue theorem was used , and where @xmath823 stands for the various constants that appear . the sum over @xmath8",
    "can then be easily done with the aid of a geometric series , resulting in the expression [ fint ] f__1 _ 2 ( ) = 4 _ 0^dp   [ ( _ 12^+ p ) + ( _ 12 ^ -p ) - e^-cp(1+e^p ) ]  . in order to perform this integral ,",
    "we expand out the factors @xmath824 using a geometric series , resulting altogether in a double series indexed by natural numbers @xmath825 .",
    "the integral can be pulled inside this double series and can then be performed fairly easily for each term .",
    "each such term turns out to be a logarithm , so the double series of these logarithms becomes a logarithm of a doubly infinite product .",
    "the end result can be written as @xmath826 the product over @xmath272 can be performed with the aid of the well - known infinite product ( z+1 ) = _ m=1^ ( 1 + ) ^-1 e^z / m  , and this results in the formula for @xmath827 quoted in the main text after choosing for @xmath663 the value @xmath787 .    in case",
    "we consider two coinciding complementary series representations @xmath828 , we have to take into account the different conjugation and different scalar product .",
    "one then finds that the same analytic properties , and in particular the same functional equation are required for the factor @xmath829 .",
    "the solution is given by the same infinite product formula quoted in the main text , but we now need to choose @xmath830 .",
    "this guarantees in particular absolute convergence of the infinite product , as one may see using standard asymptotic expansions of the gamma function .",
