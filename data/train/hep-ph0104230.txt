    "one of the main problems of searching for an intermediate mass higgs boson at a hadronic collider is that it is hard to observe the dominant @xmath9 decay mode due to the huge qcd @xmath2 background .",
    "an attractive possibility is to search for the process in which the higgs boson is produced with a large rapidity gap on either side .",
    "the cleanest situation is double - diffractive exclusive production [ eq : a1 ] pp p + h + p , where the plus sign is used to indicate a rapidity gap ( and similarly for @xmath10 collisions ) .",
    "however the predicted cross section is rather small @xcite .",
    "first , due to the proton form factors , the available phase space is strongly limited in the transverse momentum of the produced higgs , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the proton .",
    "second , we must include the probability that the rapidity gaps survive the soft rescattering effects of spectator partons which may populate the gaps with secondary particles see , for instance , ref .",
    "third , the cross section is also suppressed by qcd radiative effects .",
    "that is by sudakov - like suppression factors which allow for the possibility not to bremsstrahlung gluons which again may populate the rapidity gaps .    to enlarge the cross section we can consider semi - inclusive configurations @xcite in which the protons may dissociate , [ eq : a2 ] pp x + h + y , but where the higgs is still isolated by rapidity gaps . in this case there is no proton - form - factor suppression and the higgs bosons populate a much larger @xmath13 phase space .",
    "simultaneously the qcd radiative suppression becomes weaker , since the sudakov double @xmath14 takes the form @xmath15 , where now @xmath16 .",
    "moreover a significant contribution to process ( [ eq : a2 ] ) comes from higgs production via @xmath0 fusion ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , where on account of the large @xmath17 boson mass the cross section is rather flat in @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , since this process is mediated by @xmath18-channel @xmath17 exchange , which is a point - like colourless object , there is no corresponding bremsstrahlung in the central region @xcite and thus the sudakov suppression of the rapidity gaps does not occur .",
    "another contribution to ( [ eq : a2 ] ) comes from the qcd subprocess @xmath19 , where the colour flow of the hard @xmath18-channel gluons is screened by an accompanying , relatively soft , @xmath18-channel gluon as in fig .",
    "the double - gluon - exchange mechanism was first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also , for example , @xcite ) in terms of higgs production by pomeron - pomeron fusion , using a non - perturbative two - gluon model of the pomeron .",
    "however it was shown @xcite that , at best , the @xmath20 mechanism gives a contribution comparable to @xmath21 , for large rapidity gaps . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath22 fusion is the dominant mechanism for the qcd @xmath2 background to the semi - inclusive @xmath9 production process ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . in this respect the exclusive process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) appears to offer a better signal / background ratio since @xmath23 vanishes as @xmath24 in the forward direction due to a specific @xmath25 selection rule @xcite , and @xmath26 production is suppressed .",
    "@xmath27 is the transverse energy of one of the jets . as mentioned above , the only problem is that the predicted cross section is too small to exploit the exclusive higgs signal , at least at the tevatron .    for semi - inclusive production",
    "there is no @xmath25 selection rule to suppress the @xmath2 background .",
    "moreover the expected @xmath2 mass resolution is worse than in the exclusive case .",
    "thus the signal - to - background ratio is relatively small @xcite , [ eq : b2 ] ~ 0.01 ( ) ^3 ( ) , where @xmath28 is the mass resolution .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that it is possible to select a kinematic domain where semi - inclusive higgs production may be identified at the lhc .",
    "we exploit the much flatter @xmath13 dependence of semi - inclusive production and select higgs candidates with large @xmath13 , say @xmath29 .",
    "we show that it is possible to tune the @xmath13 and the rapidity cuts to select a domain where the predicted cross section is not too small so that the higgs stands out from the background higgs inclusively produced by @xmath0 fusion , and to suppress the @xmath30 background which is steeper in @xmath13 , was originally proposed in @xcite . ] .",
    "we use the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , and include the recent evaluations of the survival probabilities of the rapidity gaps @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath9 signal is described in section  2 , and the computation of the qcd @xmath2 background is the subject of section  3 .",
    "numerical predictions for the signal and background are given in section  4 for particular choices of the large @xmath29 cut and of the rapidity gaps .    in section  5",
    "we discuss the possibility of observing the higgs boson via process ( [ eq : a2 ] ) in the @xmath31 decay mode or , as the higgs becomes heavier , by @xmath32 decays . in both of these cases",
    "the branching ratio for an intermediate mass higgs is much smaller than that for @xmath9 , but there is almost no qcd background , provided that we select events with rapidity gaps . in section  6",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "the cross section for electroweak higgs production of fig .",
    "1(a ) is well known @xcite . to obtain the @xmath13 distribution of the higgs we need to perform the integration @xcite [ eq : a3 ] ^(2 ) ( _ 1 t + _ 2 t - q_t )  , where @xmath34 are the transverse momenta of the exchanged @xmath35 bosons .",
    "the parton - parton luminosity , which controls the normalisation of the cross section , was calculated using mrst partons @xcite . at first sight",
    "it appears sufficient to evaluate the parton distributions at scales @xmath36 , and at the corresponding @xmath37 values , but the situation is not so trivial .",
    "the problem is that the partons coupled to the @xmath17 bosons are emitted with rather large transverse momenta , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and materialise as jets with secondaries which may lie inside the rapidity gaps . in order not to have jets with rapidity close to that of the higgs boson , that is to have @xmath40 , with [ eq : a4 ]",
    "x_min^i = ( m_h + p_it ( |_min^i|)/ , see also @xcite .",
    "here we have assumed that the higgs boson is produced with rapidity , we simply make a boost and multiply the right - hand- side of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) by @xmath41 . ]",
    "@xmath42 .",
    "in order to retain a large part of the cross section , and also to have a favourable signal - to - background ratio , the experimental cuts must be chosen with care .",
    "for illustration we calculate the event rates for the particular configuration shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we require that the jet , say jet 2 , with the smaller @xmath5 ( @xmath43 ) satisfies [ eq : a6 ] _ 2 = _ 2 - _ h > 3.3 , while we allow jet 1 with the largest @xmath5 to be possibly closer to the higgs [ eq : a5 ] _ 1 = _ h - _ 1 > 1.8 .",
    "thus we have a rapidity gap @xmath44 , except for the @xmath9 decay .",
    "moreover , within the overall rapidity interval @xmath45 we require no other jets , apart from the @xmath46 jets and possibly the two jets coupled to the exchanged bosons .",
    "however we allow for the possibility of one extra jet arising from the usual parton structure function evolution associated with the larger @xmath5 jet lying in the interval with the smaller @xmath47 , see fig .  2 .",
    "in the leading @xmath14 approximation the separation between these two jets ( denoted @xmath38 and @xmath48 on fig .",
    "2 ) should be @xmath49 , but in reality the expectation is @xmath50 .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath51 jets do not have to be within the rapidity interval @xmath45 .",
    "the requirement is that the @xmath38 and @xmath48 jets have @xmath52 , and the @xmath39 jet has @xmath53 .",
    "the configuration reflected in the origin ( @xmath54 ) is also allowed .",
    "this combination of rapidity gaps and jets ( together with the possible tagging of @xmath55-jets and the reconstruction of their vertices ) can provide a strong signature for higgs production .",
    "the predicted cross sections corresponding to the configurations allowed by fig .  2 are presented in section  4 .",
    "the @xmath2 background is calculated using the formalism described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same jet configurations as given above .",
    "the cross section is given by the convolution of the parton - parton luminosity and the production of @xmath2 in a colour - singlet configuration via the fusion of two bfkl pomerons , see fig .",
    "the @xmath56 part of the cross section is given by [ eq : a7 ] = _ s^4 , where @xmath57 and the expression in brackets is the @xmath58 colour - singlet hard subprocess cross section @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the qcd pomerons , each represented by two - gluon exchange , are described by bfkl non - forward amplitudes @xcite .",
    "non - forward because the dominant contribution comes from the asymmetric region where the transverse momentum @xmath60 carried by the screening gluon is much smaller than the total momentum transfer carried by the pomeron . due to the asymmetry we have , besides @xmath61 , a second logarithm , @xmath62 in the bfkl evolution .",
    "the summation of the double logarithms accounts for the probability not to emit extra gluons within the rapidity gap covered by the pomeron .",
    "in addition , we must include the usual sudakov form factors which arise from the requirement that there is no gluon emission in the intervals @xmath63 to @xmath27 .",
    "the factor @xmath64 in the cross section formula ( [ eq : a7 ] ) arises from the integration over the @xmath18-channel gluon loop in the amplitude of the process shown in fig .",
    "@xmath64 contains the bfkl amplitude and all the suppression factors arising from the requirement that there should be no gluon emission in the rapidity gaps , and it is given by eq .",
    "( 27 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course the @xmath65 cross section , @xmath59 , becomes too large at small @xmath27 , see ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to suppress this qcd @xmath2 background we impose a cut @xmath66  gev in the @xmath2 rest frame . for a dijet system of mass @xmath67",
    "gev this corresponds to the restriction that @xmath55 and @xmath68 jets have polar angles @xmath69 .",
    "the same cuts must be applied to the @xmath70 decay and as a consequence we lose about half of the signal . in terms of rapidities",
    "it means that we select events with jets with @xmath71 , see fig .  2 .",
    "we have integrated the cross sections described above over the @xmath2 transverse momentum interval @xmath29 ( with @xmath72 or 40  gev ) , and over the rapidity of the @xmath2 pair .",
    "the main contribution comes from the central region , @xmath73 .",
    "we use a fixed in the double logarithmic form of the bfkl non - forward amplitude one obtains , after the loop integration over @xmath60 , essentially the same result @xmath74 as for the case of fixed @xmath75 . since we select @xmath2 events with @xmath76  gev , the transverse momentum of the harder gluon is in the region 10 - 30  gev , corresponding to @xmath77 . ]",
    "coupling @xmath77 , which represents the typical coupling in the selected kinematical domain , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    .@xmath78 and @xmath13 are in gev .",
    "the cross sections are in fb , and correspond to the rapidity cuts shown in fig .  2 , _ except _ for the @xmath3 values shown in brackets which correspond to the softer cuts given in the text .",
    "unlike the total @xmath79 , the @xmath9 signal and background cross sections include the @xmath1 branching fraction , the @xmath55 and @xmath68 tagging efficiency and the polar angle @xmath69 cut on the @xmath55 and @xmath68 jets .",
    "the upper and lower halves of the table correspond to using the survival probabilities of the rapidity gaps that were determined in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  1 we present the signal and background rates for two different values of the higgs boson mass and for the two choices of the @xmath80 cut .",
    "the upper and lower halves of the table correspond to different treatments of the survival probabilities of the rapidity gaps , as explained below .",
    "the column of values of @xmath79 shows the @xmath81 cross sections which allow for the rapidity gaps of fig .  2 and for the @xmath29 cut , but which do _ not _ include the @xmath9 branching ratio , or the @xmath82 jet cut or for the efficiency of the @xmath55 and @xmath68 jet tagging . if we include these latter effects and @xmath68 jets .",
    "] then we have the useful  @xmath83 signal shown in the next column in table  1 , followed by the cross section for the qcd @xmath56 background .",
    "these cross section values shown in the table correspond to ( [ eq : a7 ] ) convoluted with the parton - parton luminosity , with ( [ eq : a7 ] ) integrated over the @xmath55 and @xmath68 jet rapidities , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and over a small bin of transverse energy which corresponds to @xmath2 events in the higgs mass interval .",
    "the smallness of this interval is limited by the experimental jet resolution .",
    "here we assume @xmath86  gev in the @xmath2 centre - of - mass frame .    the predictions in the top half of the table correspond to using the values of the survival probability @xmath87 listed in the double - diffractive ( dd ) column of table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath88  tev .",
    "that is @xmath89 for the @xmath90 signal ( where we assume that the spatial distribution of the quarks is described by the electromagnetic form factor of the proton with slope 5.5  gev@xmath91 ) and @xmath92 for the @xmath56 background ( where the slope of the corresponding distribution is taken to be 4  gev@xmath91 ) . in this case for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath93 at the lhc we have , for @xmath94  gev and @xmath95  gev , about 1000 @xmath33 identified events sitting on top of a qcd @xmath2 background of 14,000 events , see table  1 .",
    "this would give an 8 standard - deviation signal .",
    "increasing the @xmath13 cut improves the signal / background ratio , but decreases the number of events , so in fact the quality of the signal declines if , for example , we were to choose the cut @xmath29 with @xmath96  gev .",
    "the above values of the survival probability @xmath87 of the rapidity gaps were calculated @xcite using a two - channel rescattering eikonal in which the diffractive eigen - channels have different cross sections of absorption , @xmath97 with @xmath98 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , arguments were given that the lower cross section arises mainly from the valence quark configurations and that the higher cross section comes dominantly from the gluon and sea quark configurations .",
    "adopting this simplified model would give a larger @xmath87 for @xmath21 production for the gaps surrounding @xmath90 fusion by observing the closely related central production of a @xmath99 boson with the same rapidity gap and jet signature @xcite .",
    "] where the valence quarks play a dominant role , and a lower @xmath87 for the qcd @xmath100 background , which originates from the gluons .",
    "of course , now the survival factor @xmath87 depends on the values of the mass and @xmath13 of the higgs boson ( or @xmath2-pair ) . for smaller values of the mass and @xmath13",
    "the screening corrections are stronger , since there is a larger contribution caused by gluon - gluon collisions . for a pure gluon - gluon interaction",
    "the factor @xmath101 in this model , while for a valence quark collision @xmath102 ( and @xmath103 for the case of gluon and valence quark collisions ) .    averaging over all contributions we obtain a suppression factor @xmath104 for qcd @xmath2-pair production , whereas @xmath105 for higgs production via the @xmath0-fusion .",
    "the limits of the range of @xmath87 correspond respectively to the largest and smallest values of @xmath13 and mass in table 1 .",
    "as was expected the factor @xmath87 is closer to @xmath106 for the case of qcd @xmath2 double - pomeron production , but for higgs production it is closer to the @xmath107 value .",
    "the results for this model are shown in the lower half of table  1 .",
    "thus for a luminosity 100  fb@xmath108  gev and @xmath76  gev , we have a chance to identify 1600 @xmath9 events sitting on a background of 11,600 events .",
    "this would be about a 15 standard - deviation effect . to put it another way",
    ", a luminosity of 12  fb@xmath93 would be enough to achieve a 5 standard - deviation signal .    of course , the above cuts and corresponding predictions are just examples .",
    "the experimental cuts should be optimized , taking into account the specifics of the detectors .",
    "also note that there is a factor of two uncertainty in the background prediction due to the use of the double @xmath14 approximation .",
    "fortunately the single @xmath14 contributions are suppressed in our asymmetric two - gluon - exchange domain , so that we are not so sensitive to the uncertain higher - order bfkl effects .",
    "another possibility is to observe the @xmath31 decay mode , where there is practically no qcd background . of course , the small @xmath31 branching fraction leads to a small cross section , as shown in table  1 .",
    "however we may increase the signal by choosing softer cuts .",
    "for example , the values of the cross section shown in brackets correspond to the cut @xmath112  gev , and the rapidity cuts of the accompanying jets @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( for the case @xmath42 , as in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the main background for the @xmath31 signal comes from the central production of the @xmath99 boson and its subsequent @xmath115 decay . if we were able to reconstruct the mass of the @xmath115 pair it would be easy to identify @xmath116 events .",
    "unfortunately there are two unobserved @xmath117 neutrinos from the @xmath118 decays .",
    "it does not mean @xmath119 is completely unknown .",
    "it may be estimated from the decay configurations and @xmath120 emerge back - to - back .",
    "since @xmath121 , the direction of the decay products is , to a good approximation , collinear with the parent @xmath118 .",
    "hence we can find the lorentz boost , @xmath122 , needed to restore the collinearity of the two @xmath118 s .",
    "also the transverse momentum @xmath123 can be measured as the momentum balancing that of the jets or simply as the missing @xmath27 .",
    "hence we can estimate the value of @xmath78 .",
    "] , but the accuracy is not so good . the cross section for the central production of a @xmath99 boson , accompanied by two jets , has been calculated for the lhc energy in ref .",
    "@xcite , however without including the survival probability @xmath87 of the rapidity gaps .",
    "if we include @xmath87 in their results then the @xmath124 jet cross section is predicted to be about 6  fb for the cuts similar to the ones that were chosen for the larger @xmath31 signal shown in brackets in table  1 .",
    "the background is therefore an order of magnitude , or more , larger than the higgs signal .",
    "nevertheless , if the mass resolution is not too bad , there is a chance to identify the @xmath31 signal .",
    "clearly the @xmath125 decay mode will pose less of a problem the higher the value of @xmath78 .",
    "for larger values of @xmath78 the @xmath31 decay mode decreases as the @xmath4 decay opens up .",
    "therefore for the heavier higgs boson it is more promising to search for the @xmath4 and @xmath126 signals signal may be considered as a discovery mode , even for a light @xmath127 higgs boson , if one selects events where the higgs is produced by @xmath0 fusion in association with two light quark jets .",
    "the corresponding kinematics ( similar to that shown in fig .",
    "2 ) were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "however another criteria for the large rapidity gap was used in @xcite ( within the gap no jets with @xmath128  gev are permitted ) and so another gap - survival factor was used . ] .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are listed in the last column of table  1 .",
    "we see , for @xmath129  gev , that the @xmath4 cross section is about 20  fb .",
    "again there is practically no qcd background in the configuration with two large rapidity gaps either side of the parent higgs .",
    "of course , we must allow for the detection efficiency of the various decay modes .",
    "it is difficult to extract the value of @xmath78 from the leptonic decays of both the @xmath17 and @xmath130",
    ". however it may be possible to use the decay configuration @xmath131 two quark jets and @xmath132 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath133 4 leptons process will provide a rather clean signature .",
    "finally , we emphasize if @xmath134 , then adding the rapidity signature to the gold - plated @xmath135 4 lepton channel , would practically eliminate the background due to @xmath30 .",
    "the higgs signal may be thus purified at the expense of introducing the survival probability factor @xmath87 , and in this way allow a more precise study of the properties of the higgs boson .",
