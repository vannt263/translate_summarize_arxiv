    "one of the main lessons from the general theory of relativity is that one can formulate theories that , in their lagrangian description , are diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "this means that one can perform generic diffeomorphism on the spacetime manifold and the theory remains invariant . in most instances diffeo invariance is achieved by formulating the theory as an action principle where the lagrangian density is defined without the use of background structures ; it is only the dynamical fields that appear in the action . in this manner one incorporates the ` stage ' , the gravitational field , as one of the dynamical fields that one can describe .",
    "the fact that one can write a term that captures the dynamics of the gravitational field is interesting by itself .",
    "it is then worth exploring all the freedom available in the definition of an action principle for general relativity .",
    "this is the main task that we shall undertake in this article .",
    "note that we shall restrict ourselves to general relativity and shall not consider generalizations such as scalar - tensor theories nor massive gravity in our analysis .",
    "the first question that we shall address is that of having a well posed variational principle .",
    "this particularly ` tame ' requirement seems , however , to be sometimes overlooked in the literature . it is natural to ask why we need to have a well posed action principle if , at the end of the day , we already ` know ' what the field equations are .",
    "while this is certainly true , one should not forget that the classical theory is only a ( very useful indeed ! ) approximation to a deeper underlying theory that must be quantum in nature .",
    "if , for instance , we think of a quantum theory defined by some path integral , in order for this to be well defined , we need to be able to write a meaningful action for the whole space of histories , and not only for the space of classical solutions .",
    "this observation becomes particularly vexing when the physical situation under consideration involves a spacetime region with boundaries .",
    "one must be particularly careful to extend the formalism in order to incorporate such boundary terms .",
    "another equally important issue in the definition of a physical theory is that of the choice of fundamental variables , specially when gauge symmetries are present .",
    "again , even when the space of solutions might coincide for two formulations , the corresponding actions will in general be different and that will certainly have an effect in the path integral formulation of the quantum theory . in the case of general relativity , the better known formulation is of course in terms of a metric tensor @xmath3 , satisfying second order ( einstein ) equations .",
    "but there are other choices of variables that yield alternative descriptions . here",
    "we shall consider one of those possibilities .",
    "in particular , the choice we shall make is motivated by writing the theory as a _ local _ gauge theory under the lorentz group . it is well known that one can either obtain einstein equations of motion by means of the einstein hilbert action or in terms of the so called palatini action , a first order action in terms of tetrads @xmath4 and a connection @xmath5 valued on a lie algebra of @xmath6 ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) and an affine connection @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the action we are considering here , in the so called  vielbein \" formalism , was developed in @xcite and in @xcite in the canonical formulation . ] .",
    "also , it is known that we can have a generalization of this action by adding a term , the holst term , that still gives us the same equations of motion and also allows us to express the theory in terms of real su(2 ) connections in its canonical description ( see . e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this action , known as the holst action , is the starting point of loop quantum gravity and some spin foam models . in the same first order scheme one can look for the most general diffeomorphism invariant first order action that classically describes general relativity , which can be written as the palatini action ( including the holst term ) plus topological contributions , namely , the pontryagin , euler and nieh - yan terms .",
    "furthermore , if the spacetime region we are considering possesses boundaries one might have to add extra terms ( apart from the topological terms that can also be seen as boundary terms ) to the action principle .",
    "thus , the most general first order action for gravity has the form , @xmath8 = s_{\\rm palatini } + s_{\\rm holst term } + s_{\\rm pontryagin } + s_{\\rm euler } + s_{\\rm nieh - yan } + s_{\\rm boundary}.\\ ] ] it is noteworthy to emphasize that in the standard textbook treatment of hamiltonian systems one usually considers compact spaces without boundary , so there is no need to worry about the boundary terms that come from the integration by parts in the variational principle .",
    "but if one is interested in spacetimes with boundaries we can no longer neglect these boundary terms and it is mandatory to analyze them carefully .",
    "in order to properly study this action in the whole space - time with boundaries , we need the action principle to be well posed , i.e. we want the action to be _ differentiable and finite _ under the appropriate boundary conditions , and under the most general variations compatible with the boundary conditions .",
    "it has been shown that under appropriate boundary conditions , the palatini action plus a boundary term provides a well posed action principle , that is , it is differentiable and finite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the analysis for asymptotically flat boundary conditions was extended to include the holst term . here",
    "we will refer to this well posed holst action as the generalized holst action ( gha ) .    in order to explore some properties of the theories defined by an action principle",
    ", the covariant hamiltonian formalism seems to be particularly appropriate ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in this formalism",
    ", one can introduce the standard hamiltonian structures such as a phase space , symplectic structure , canonical transformations etc , without the need of a @xmath9 decomposition of the theory .",
    "all the relevant objects are _ covariant_. the most attractive feature of this formalism is that one can find all these structures in a unique fashion given the action principle .",
    "furthermore one can , in a ` canonical ' way , find conserved quantities . on the one hand one can derive hamiltonian generators of canonical transformations and ,",
    "on the other hand , noetherian conserved quantities associated to symmetries .",
    "one important and interesting issue is to understand the precise relation between these two sets of quantities .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explore all these issues in a systematic way .",
    "more concretely , we have three main goals .",
    "the first one is to explore the well - posedness of the action principle with generic boundary terms .",
    "for that we shall study two sets of boundary conditions that are physically interesting ; as outer boundary we shall consider configurations that are asymptotically flat , and in an inner boundary , those histories that satisfy isolated horizon boundary conditions .",
    "the second objective is to explore the most basic structures in the covariant phase space formulation .",
    "more precisely , we shall study the existence of the symplectic structure as a finite quantity and its dependence on the various topological and boundary terms . finally , the last goal is to explore the different conserved quantities that can be defined .",
    "concretely , we shall consider hamiltonian conserved charges both at infinity and at the horizon .",
    "finally we shall construct the associated noetherian conserved current and charges .",
    "in both cases we shall study in detail how these quantities depend on the existence of the boundary terms that make the action well defined .",
    "as we shall show , while the hamiltonian charges are insensitive to those quantities , the noether charges _ do _ depend on the form of the boundary terms added .",
    "while some of these results are not new and have appeared somewhere else , we have several new results and clarifications of several issues . equally important",
    "is the fact that in no publication have all the results available been put in a coherent and systematic fashion .",
    "thus , the final goal of this article is to fill this gap and to present the subject in a pedagogical and self - contained manner .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] we review what it means for an action principle to be well posed , which is when it is finite and differentiable . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we use some results discussed in the previous section , to review the covariant hamiltonian formalism taking enough care in the cases when the spacetime has boundaries .",
    "we begin by defining the covariant phase space and its relation with the canonical phase space .",
    "then we introduce the symplectic structure with its ambiguities and its dependence on boundary terms in the action .",
    "finally we define the symplectic current structure , and the hamiltonian and noether charges . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we use the covariant hamiltonian formalism to study the action of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we find the generic boundary terms that appear when we vary the different components of the action . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we consider particular choices of boundary conditions in the action principle .",
    "in particular we study spacetimes with boundaries : asymptotically flatness at the outer boundaries , and an isolated horizon as an internal one . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we study symmetries and their generators for both sets of boundary conditions .",
    "in particular we first compute the hamiltonian conserved charges , and in the second part , the corresponding noetherian quantities are found .",
    "we comment on the difference between them .",
    "we summarize and provide some discussion in the final section  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "in this section we review the action principle that plays a fundamental role in the formulation of physical theories . in order to do that we need to be precise about what it means to have a well posed variational principle .",
    "in particular , there are two aspects to it .",
    "the first one is to define the action by itself .",
    "this is done in the first part of this section . in the second part",
    ", we introduce the variational principle that states that physical configurations will be those that make the action stationary .",
    "in particular , we entertain the possibility that the spacetime region under consideration has non - trivial boundaries and that the allowed field configurations are allowed to vary on these boundaries .",
    "these new features require an extension of the standard , textbook , treatment .      in particle mechanics",
    "the dynamics is specified by some action , which is a _ function _ of the trajectories of the particle . in turn , the action @xmath10 is the time integral of the lagriangian function @xmath11 that generically depends on the coordinates and velocities of the particles . in field theory",
    "the dynamical variables , the fields , are geometrical objects defined on spacetime ; now the lagrangian has as domain this function space . in both cases ,",
    "this type of objects are known as functionals . in order to properly define the action we will review what is a functional and some of its relevant properties .",
    "a _ functional _ is a map from a _ normed space _ ( a vector space with a non - negative real - valued norm ) into its underlying field , which in physical applications is the field of the real numbers .",
    "this vector space is normally a functional space , which is why sometimes a functional is considered as a function of a function .",
    "a special class of functionals are the definite integrals that define an action by an expression of the form , @xmath12 = \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\mathcal{l } ( \\phi^{\\alpha } , \\nabla\\phi^\\alpha, ...",
    ",\\nabla^n\\phi^{\\alpha})\\,\\d^4 v,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are fields on spacetime , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is an abstract label for spacetime and internal indices , @xmath16 their first derivatives , and @xmath17 their @xmath18 derivatives , and @xmath19 a volume element on spacetime .",
    "this integral @xmath20 $ ] maps a field history @xmath21 into a real number if the lagrangian density @xmath22 is real - valued .",
    "prior to checking the well posedness of this action , we will review what it means for an action to be finite and differentiable .",
    "we say that an action is _ finite _ iff the integral that defines it is convergent or has a finite value when evaluated in _ histories _ compatible with the boundary conditions .      as the minimum action principle states , the classical trajectories followed by the system are those for which the action is a stationary point .",
    "this means that , to first order , the variations of the action vanish .",
    "as is well known , the origin of this emphasis on extremal histories comes from the path integral formalism where one can show that trajectories that extremise the action contribute the most to the path integral .",
    "first , let us consider some definitions :    let @xmath23 be a normed space of function .",
    "a functional @xmath24 is called differentiable if we can write the finite change of the action , under the variation @xmath25 , as f [ + ] -f [ ] = f + r , where @xmath26 ( we are assuming here that vectors @xmath27 belong to the space @xmath23 , so it is a linear space ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 $ ] depends linearly on @xmath29 , and @xmath30 = { \\mathcal o}((\\de\\phi)^2)$ ] .",
    "the linear part of the increment , @xmath31 , is called the _ variation of the funcional _ @xmath32 ( along @xmath29 ) .",
    "a stationary point @xmath33 of a differentiable funcional @xmath34 $ ] is a function @xmath33 such that @xmath35=0 $ ] for all @xmath29 .    as is standard in theoretical physics , we begin with a basic assumption : the dynamics is specified by an action . in most field theories",
    "the action depends only on the fundamental fields and their first derivatives .",
    "interestingly , this is not the case for the einstein hilbert action of general relativity , but it _ is _ true for first order formulations of general relativity , which is the case that we shall analyze in the present work .    in general",
    ", we can define an action on a four dimensional manifold @xmath14 , with topology @xmath36 depending on the fields , @xmath37 and their first derivatives , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath39 = \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\mathcal{l } \\left ( \\phi^{\\alpha } , \\nabla_{\\mu } \\phi^{\\alpha } \\right)\\ , \\d^4 v\\ , .\\ ] ] its variation @xmath40 is the linear part of _ ^4 v , where @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that @xmath42 = \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\left [ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{l } } { \\partial \\phi^{\\alpha } } -   \\nabla_{\\mu } \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{l } } { \\partial ( \\nabla_{\\mu } \\phi^{\\alpha } ) } \\right ] \\delta \\phi^{\\alpha }   \\,\\ , \\d^4 v + \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\nabla_{\\mu } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{l } } { \\partial ( \\nabla_{\\mu } \\phi^{\\alpha } ) } \\ , \\delta \\phi^{\\alpha } \\right ) \\d^4 v\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have integrated by parts to obtain the second term .",
    "let us denote the integrand of the first term as : @xmath43 .",
    "note that the second term on the right hand side is a divergence so we can write it as a boundary term using stokes theorem , @xmath44 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath45 that will be relevant in sections to follow .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath46 $ ] can be interpeted as the directional derivative of the funtion(al ) @xmath10 along the vector @xmath29 .",
    "let us introduce the simbol @xmath47 to denote the exterior derivative on the functional space @xmath48 .",
    "then , we can write @xmath49=\\ed\\ , s(\\de\\phi)=\\de\\phi(s)$ ] , where the last equality employs the standard convention of representing the vector field , @xmath29 , acting on the function @xmath10 .    as we mentioned before ,",
    "if we want to derive in a consistent way the equations of motion for the system , the action must be differentiable .",
    "in particular , this means that we need the boundary term ( [ standardsymplecticpotential ] ) to be zero . to simply demand that @xmath50 , as is usually done in introductory textbooks ,",
    "becomes too restrictive if we want to allow _ all _ the variations @xmath51 which preserve appropiate boundary conditions and not just variations of compact support .",
    "thus , requiring the action to be stationary with respect to all compatible variations should yield precisely the classical equations of motion , with the respective boundary term vanishing on any allowed variation .",
    "let us now consider the case in which the spacetime region @xmath52 , where the action is defined , has a boundary @xmath53",
    ". this could be the case , for example , is we have @xmath54 and we consider certain asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "we could then regard ` infinity ' as a boundary of the spacetime region .",
    "another possibility is to consider an internal boundary , as would be the case when there is a black hole present .",
    "now , given an action principle and boundary conditions on the fields , a natural question may arise , on whether the action principle will be well posed .",
    "so far there is no general answer , but there are examples where the introduction of a boundary term is needed to make the action principle well defined , as we shall show in the examples below .",
    "let us then keep the discussion open and consider a generic action principle that we assume to be well defined in a region with boundaries , and with possible contributions to the action by boundary terms .",
    "therefore , the action of such a well posed variational principle will look like , @xmath55 = \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\mathcal{l } \\left ( \\phi^{\\alpha } , \\nabla_{\\mu } \\phi^{\\alpha } \\right)\\ , \\d^4 v + \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{m } } \\varphi ( \\phi^{\\alpha } ) \\,\\ , \\d^3 v\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have considered the possibility that there is contribution to the action coming from the boundary @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the variation of this _ extended _ action becomes , @xmath56 = \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } e_{\\alpha}\\ ; \\delta \\phi^{\\alpha } \\ ; \\d^4 v +   \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{m } }   \\theta ( \\phi^{\\alpha } , \\delta \\phi^{\\alpha } ) \\ ; \\d^3 v +   \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{m } }   \\delta \\varphi ( \\phi^{\\alpha } ) \\ ; \\d^3 v\\ , .\\ ] ] the action principle will be well posed if the first term is finite and @xmath57 is a boundary term that makes the action well defined under appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "that is , when the action is evaluated along _ histories _ that are compatible with the boundary conditions , the numerical value of the integral should be finite , and in the variation ( [ generalwellposedvarprin ] ) , the contribution from the boundary terms must vanish .",
    "now , asking @xmath46=0 $ ] , for arbitrary variations @xmath27 of the fields , implies that the fields must satisfy @xmath58the _ euler - lagrange _ equations of motion .",
    "note that in the `` standard approach '' , i.e. when one simply considers variations , say , of compact support such that @xmath50 , we can always add a term of the form @xmath59 to the lagrangian density , @xmath60 with @xmath61 arbitrary .",
    "the relevant fact here is that this term will _ not _ modify the equations of motion since the variation of the action becomes , @xmath62 thus , by the boundary conditions , @xmath50 , the second term of the right - hand side vanishes , that is , @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it does not matter which boundary term we add to the action ; it will not modify the equations of motion .    on the contrary ,",
    "when one considers variational principles of the form ( [ generalwellposedaction ] ) , consistent with arbitrary ( compatible ) variations in spacetime regions with boundaries , we can not just add arbitrary total divergences / boundary term to the action , but only those that preserve the action principle well - posedness , in the sense mentioned before .",
    "adding to the action any other term that does not satisfy this condition will spoil the differentiability properties of the action and , therefore , one would not obtain the equations of motion in a consistent manner .",
    "this concludes our review of the action principle .",
    "let us now recall how one can get a consistent covariant hamiltonian formulation , once the action principle at hand is well posed .",
    "in this section we give a self - contained review of the _ covariant hamiltonian formalism _",
    "( chf ) taking special care of the cases where boundaries are present .",
    "if the theory under study has a _ well posed initial value formulation _ , then , given the initial data we have a unique solution to the equations of motion . in this way we have an isomorphism @xmath64 between the space of solutions to the equations of motion , @xmath2 , and the space of all valid initial data , the ` canonical phase space ' @xmath65 . in this even dimensional space , particles ,",
    "we need to specify as initial data their initial positions and velocities , so the space of all possible initial data is an even dimensional space .",
    "we can easily extend this to field theory .",
    "] we can construct a nondegenerate , closed @xmath66form @xmath67 , the symplectic form .",
    "together , the phase space and the symplectic form constitute a symplectic manifold @xmath68 .",
    "we can bring the symplectic structure to the space of solutions , via the pullback @xmath69 of @xmath67 and define a corresponding 2-form on @xmath2 .",
    "in this way the space of solutions is equipped with a _",
    "symplectic form , @xmath70 , since the mapping is independent of the reference cauchy surface one is using to define @xmath64 .",
    "together , the space of solutions and its symplectic structure @xmath71 are known as the _ covariant phase space _ ( cps ) .    however , most of the field theories of interest present _ gauge _ symmetries . this fact",
    "is reflected on the symplectic form @xmath70 , making it _",
    "degenerate_. when this is the case , @xmath70 is only a pre - symplectic form , to emphasize the degeneracy .",
    "it is only after one gets rid of this degeneracy , by means of an appropriate quotient , that one recovers a physical non - degenerate symplectic structure .",
    "this section has three parts . in the first one ,",
    "we introduce the relevant structure in the definition of the covariant phase space , starting from the action principle .",
    "in particular , we see that boundary terms that appear in the ` variation ' of the action are of particular relevance to the construction of the symplectic structure .",
    "we shall pay special attention to the presence of boundary terms in the original action and how that gets reflected in the hamiltonian formulation . in the second part",
    ", we recall the issue of symmetries of the theory .",
    "that is , when there are certain symmetries of the underlying spacetime , these get reflected in the hamiltonian formalism . of particular relevance",
    "is the construction of the corresponding conserved quantities , that are both conserved and play an important role of being the generators of such symmetries .",
    "in particular we focus our attention on the symmetries generated by certain vector fields , closely related to the issue of diffeomorphism invariance . in the third part we compare and contrast these hamiltonian conserved quantities with the so - called noether symmetries and charges .",
    "we show how they are related and comment on the fact that , contrary to the hamiltonian charges , the corresponding ` noetherian ' quantities _ do _ depend on the existence of boundary terms in the original action .",
    "in this part we shall introduce the relevant objects that define the covariant phase space . before proceeding we shall make some remarks regarding notation .",
    "it has proved to be useful to use differential forms to deal with certain diffeomorphism invariant theories , and we shall do that here . however , when working with differential forms in field theories one has to distinguish between the exterior derivative @xmath47 in the infinite dimensional covariant phase space , and the ` standard ' exterior derivative on the spacetime manifold , denoted by @xmath72 . in this context ,",
    "differential forms in the cps act on vectors tangent to the space of solutions @xmath2 .",
    "we use @xmath73 or @xmath74 to denote tangent vectors , to be consistent with the standard notation used in the literature .",
    "we hope that no confusion should arise by such a choice .",
    "let us now recall some basic constructions on the covariant phase space .",

    "in the language of forms the spacetime index referring to the nature of the object in space - time will not appear explicitly , so we are left only with internal indices that we shall denote with @xmath81 to distinguish them from spacetime indices @xmath82 .",

    "note that we are using @xmath85 and @xmath73 , to denote _ the same _ object .",
    "for simplicity in the notation , sometimes the @xmath78 part is dropped out .",
    "here we wrote both for clarity . as we mentioned in the previous section",
    ", the second term of the rhs is obtained after integration by parts , and using stokes theorem it can be written as , @xmath86 this term can be seen as a @xmath87form in the covariant phase space , acting on vectors @xmath85 and returning a real number .",
    "also it can be seen as a potential for the symplectic structure , that we already mentioned in the preamble of this section and shall define below .",

    "the `` next best thing '' is that this integral is `` controllable '' .",
    "let us be more specific .",
    "if , after imposing boundary conditions , the integral takes the form , @xmath130 we can still define a _ conserved _ pre - symplectic structure . from ( [ intjzero ] ) , and assuming the integral over the outer boundary vanishes , we now have @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the intersections of space - like surfaces @xmath119 and @xmath120 with the inner boundary @xmath121 , respectively",
    ". therefore we can define the _ conserved _ pre - symplectic structure as , @xmath134 note that by construction , the two form @xmath135 is closed , so it is justified to call it a ( pre-)symplectic structure .",
    "let us now explore how the covariant hamiltonian formulation can deal with the existence of symmetries , and their associated conserved quantities .",
    "before that , let us recall the standard notion of a hamiltonian vector field ( hvf ) in hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "a hamiltonian vector field @xmath136 is defined as a symmetry of the symplectic structure , namely @xmath137 from this condition and the fact that @xmath138 we have , @xmath139 where @xmath140 means the _ contraction _ of the 2-form @xmath70 with the vector field @xmath136 .",
    "note that @xmath141 is a one - form on @xmath2 acting on an arbitrary vector @xmath73 .",
    "we can denote it as @xmath142 . from the previous equation",
    "we can see that @xmath143 is closed , @xmath144 .",
    "it follows from ( [ lieomegazero ] ) and from the poincar lemma that locally ( on the cps ) , there exists a function @xmath145 such that @xmath146 .",
    "we call this function , @xmath145 , the _ hamiltonian _",
    ", that generates the infinitesimal canonical transformation defined by @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , and by its own definition , @xmath145 is a _ conserved quantity _ along the flow generated by @xmath136 .",
    "note that the directional derivative of the hamiltonian @xmath145 , along an arbitrary vector @xmath73 can be written in several ways , @xmath147 some of which will be used in - distinctively in what follows .",
    "so far this vector field @xmath136 is an arbitrary hamiltonian vector field on @xmath2 . later",
    "on we will relate it to certain space - time symmetries .",
    "for instance , for field theories that possess a symmetry group , such as the poincare group for field theories on minkowski spacetime , there will be corresponding hamiltonian vector fields associated to the generators of the symmetry group .",
    "in this article we are interested in exploring gravity theories that are diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "that is , such that the diffeomorphism group acts as a ( kinematical ) symmetry of the action .",
    "of particular relevance is then to understand the role that these symmetries have in the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "in particular , one expects that diffeomorphisms play the role of _ gauge _ symmetries of the theory",
    ". however , the precise form in which diffeomorphisms can be regarded as gauge or not , depends on the details of the theory , and is dictated by the properties of the corresponding hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "another important issue is to separate those diffeomorphisms that are gauge from those that represent truly physical canonical transformations that change the system .",
    "those true motions could then be associated to symmetries of the theory .",
    "for instance , in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes , _ some _ diffeomorphism are regarded as gauge , while others represent nontrivial transformations at infinity and can be associated to the generators of the poincar group . in the case when the vector field @xmath136 generates time evolution , one expects @xmath145 to be related to the energy , the adm energy at infinity .",
    "other conserved , hamiltonian charges can thus be found , and correspond to the generators of the asymptotic symmetries of the theory .    in what follows",
    "we shall explore the aspects of the theory that allow us to separate the notion of gauge from standard symmetries of the theory .",
    "in the standard treatment of constrained systems , one starts out with the kinematical phase space @xmath148 , and there exists a constrained surface @xmath149 consisting of points that satisfy the constraints present in the theory .",
    "one then notices that the pullback of @xmath70 , the symplectic structure to @xmath149 is degenerate ( for first class constraints ) .",
    "these degenerate directions represent the gauge directions where two points are physically indistinguishable . in the covariant hamiltonian formulation we are considering here , the starting point is the space @xmath2 of solutions to _ all _ the equations of motion , where a ( pre-)symplectic structure is naturally defined , as we saw before .",
    "we call this a pre - symplectic structure since it might be degenerate .",
    "we say that @xmath135 is degenerate if there exist vectors @xmath150 such that @xmath151 for all @xmath152 .",
    "we call @xmath150 a degenerate direction ( or an element of the kernel of @xmath135 ) .",
    "if @xmath135 is degenerate we have a gauge system , with a gauge submanifold generated by the degenerate directions @xmath150 ( it is immediate to see that they satisfy the local integrability conditions to generate a submanifold ) .    note that since we are on the space of solutions to the field equations , tangent vectors @xmath152 to @xmath2 must be solutions to the _ linearized _ equations of motion .",
    "since the degenerate directions @xmath153 generate infinitesimal gauge transformations , configurations @xmath154 and @xmath155 on @xmath156 , related by such transformations , are physically indistinguishable .",
    "that is , @xmath157 and , therefore , the quotient @xmath158 constitutes the physical phase space of the system .",
    "it is only in the reduced phase space @xmath159 that one can define a non - degenerate symplectic structure @xmath70 .    in the next subsection",
    "we explain how vector fields are the infinitesimal generators of transformations on the space - time in general",
    ". then we will point out when these transformations are diffeomorphisms and moreover , when these are also gauge symmetries of the system .",
    "let us start by recalling the standard notion of a diffeomorphism on the manifold @xmath160 .",
    "later on , we shall see how , for diffeomorphism invariant theories , the induced action on phase space of certain diffeomorphisms becomes gauge transformations .",
    "there is a one - to - one relation between vector fields on a manifold and families of transformations of the manifold onto itself .",
    "let @xmath161 be a one - parameter group of transformations on @xmath14 , the map @xmath162 , defined by @xmath163 , is a differentiable mapping .",
    "if @xmath164 is the infinitesimal generator of @xmath161 and @xmath165 , @xmath166 also belongs to @xmath167 ; then the lie derivative of @xmath168 along @xmath169 , @xmath170 , represents the rate of change of the function @xmath168 under the family of transformations @xmath171 .",
    "that is , the vector field @xmath169 is the generator of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms .",
    "now , given such a vector field , a natural question is whether there exists a vector field @xmath172 on the cps that represents the induced action of the infinitesimal diffeos ?",
    "as one can easily see , the answer is in the affirmative .    in order to see that ,",
    "let us go back a bit to section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the action is defined on the space of histories ( the space of all possible configurations ) and , after taking the variation , the vectors @xmath173 lie on the tangent space to the space of histories .",
    "it is only after we restrict ourselves to the space of solutions @xmath2 , that @xmath174 .",
    "now these @xmath85 represent _ any _ vector on @xmath175 ( tangent space to @xmath2 at the point @xmath78 ) .",
    "as we already mentioned , these @xmath85 can be seen as `` small changes '' in the fields . what happens if we want the infinitesimal change of fields to be generated by a particular group of transformations ( e.g. spatial translations , boosts , rotations , etc ) ?",
    "there is indeed a preferred tangent vector for the kind of theories we are considering .",
    "given @xmath169 , consider _ ^a:=_^a . from the geometric perspective , this is the natural candidate vector field to represent the induced action of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 .",
    "the first question is whether such objects are indeed tangent vectors to @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that , _ for kinematical diffeomorphism invariant theories , lie derivatives satisfy the linearized equations of motion_. is a symmetry of the background spacetime .",
    "] of course , in the presence of boundaries such vectors must preserve the boundary conditions of the theory in order to be admissible ( more about this below ) . for instance",
    ", in the case of asymptotically flat boundary conditions , the allowed vector fields should preserve the asymptotic conditions .",
    "let us suppose that we have prescribed the phase space and pre - symplectic structure @xmath135 , and a vector field @xmath176 .",
    "the question we would like to pose is : when is such vector a degenerate direction of @xmath135 ?",
    "the equation that such vector @xmath177 must satisfy is then : | ( _ , ) = 0 , .",
    "[ cond - chida ] this equation will , as we shall see in detail below once we consider specific boundary conditions , impose some conditions on the behaviour of @xmath169 on the boundaries .",
    "an important signature of diffeomorphism invariant theories is that eq.([cond - chida ] ) _ only has contributions from the boundaries_. thus , the vanishing of such terms will depend on the behaviour of @xmath169 there . in particular , if @xmath178 on the boundary , the corresponding vector field is guaranteed to be a degenerate direction and therefore to generate _ gauge _ transformations . in some instances , non vanishing vectors at the boundary also satisfy eq .",
    "( [ cond - chida ] ) and therefore define gauge directions .",
    "let us now consider the case when @xmath169 is non vanishing on @xmath179 and eq .",
    "( [ cond - chida ] ) is not zero . in that case",
    ", we should have |(,_)= h _ ( ) = h _ , [ ecuacion - chida ] for some function @xmath180",
    ". this function will be the generator of the symplectic transformation generated by @xmath177 .",
    "in other words , @xmath180 is the _",
    "hamiltonian conserved charge _",
    "associated to the symmetry generated by @xmath169 .",
    "remark : one should make sure that eq .",
    "( [ ecuacion - chida ] ) is indeed well defined , given the degeneracy of @xmath135 . in order to see that , note that one can add to @xmath177 an arbitrary ` gauge vector ' @xmath136 and the result in the same : @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , if such function @xmath180 exists ( and we know that , locally , it does ) , it is insensitive to the existence of the gauge directions so it must be constant along those directions and , therefore , projectable to @xmath159 . thus , one can conclude that even when @xmath180 is defined through a degenerate pre - symplectic structure , it is indeed a physical observable defined on the reduced phase space .",
    "this concludes our review of the covariant phase space methods and the definition of gauge and hamiltonian conserved charges for diffeomorphism invariant theories . in the next part we shall revisit another aspect of symmetries on covariant theories , namely the existence of noether conserved quantities , which are also associated to symmetries of field theories .",
    "let us briefly review some results about the noether current 3-form @xmath182 and its relation to the symplectic current @xmath114 .",
    "for that , we shall rely on @xcite .",
    "we know that to any lagrangian theory invariant under diffeomorphisms we can associate a corresponding noether current 3-form .",

    "the most general action that gives the desired equations of motion and is compatible with the symmetries of the theory is given by the combination of palatini action , @xmath198 , holst term , @xmath199 , and three topological terms , pontryagin , @xmath200 , euler , @xmath201 , and nieh - yan , @xmath202 , invariants .",
    "as we shall see , the palatini term contains the information of the ordinary einstein - hilbert 2nd order action , so it represents the backbone of the formalism . since we are considering a spacetime region @xmath14 with boundaries , one should pay special attention to boundary conditions . for instance",

    "namely , for asymptotically flat spacetimes , we can see that the surface term in the variation of neih - yan term cancels the surface term in the variation of the holst term , and the action @xmath256 , given by [ hny ] s_= - _ ^ijf_ij- _",

    "the coupling constants @xmath266 and @xmath267 , are not fixed by our boundary conditions , while different choices for the holst - nieh - yan sector of the theory , discussed in the previous part , imply particular combinations of @xmath268 and @xmath269 . to see that , consider @xmath270 that represents the boundary term that we need to add to holst term in order to make it well defined . as we have seen in the previous analysis , if @xmath271 then the combination of the holst and nieh - yan terms is well defined and no additional boundary term is needed , so @xmath272 in that case . for every other value of @xmath273",
    "we need to add a boundary term , and in that case @xmath274 .",

    "this result is consistent with the expression for the entropy of the euler term in @xcite , obtained in the second order formalism for stationary black holes . though the noether charge of the euler term over a wih is non - vanishing , the corresponding contribution to the energy is nonetheless , zero .",
    "as we have previously seen in section  [ sec:6.1 ] , the variation of the energy at the horizon is h^_= _",
    "s_q_- ( ) , with @xmath589 . for the euler term",
    "we obtain _ s _ cl _ ( ) = 4c_s _ l()=16c_(l ) , since @xmath555 and @xmath590 .",
    "we see that this term cancels the variation of ( [ noether_euler_horizon ] ) in the expression for the energy at the horizon .",
    "finally , we have seen in section  [ sec:4.3 ] that the variation of the neih - yan term on shell is proportional to the variation of the holst term , so all the results for the noether charge of the holst term apply directly here .",
    "namely , for the neih - yan term , with its boundary term , given in ( [ well_defined_ny ] ) , we obtain that its noether charge 2-form is q_=2q _ , so that its integrals over @xmath528 and @xmath514 vanish as well .",
    "let us end this section with a remark .",
    "as we have shown , the noether charges at infinity of all the topological terms vanish for asymptotically flat boundary conditions , but this is not the case for locally asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) space - times . in @xcite , aads asymptotic conditions are considered and the noether charge at infinity of the palatini action with negative cosmological constant term turns out to be divergent . in that case the euler term is added in order to make the action well defined and finite . with this modification , the non vanishing ( infinite ) noether charge becomes finite for the well defined action .",
    "let us start by summarizing the main results that we have here presented .    1 .",
    "we have analyzed whether the most general first order action for general relativity in four dimensions has a well posed variational principle in spacetimes with boundaries .",
    "we showed that it is necessary to introduce additional boundary terms in order to have a differentiable action , which is finite for the field configurations that satisfy our boundary conditions : asymptotically flat spacetimes with an isolated horizon as an internal boundary .",
    "we discussed the impact of the topological terms and boundary terms added in order to have a well defined variational principle , to the symplectic structure and the conserved hamiltonian and noether charges of the theory .",
    "we showed that neither the topological terms nor the holst term modify the symplectic structure .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian structure of the theory remains unaffected by the introduction of boundary and topological terms .",
    "it is important to note that this result proves incorrect several assertions that have repeatedly appeared in the literature .",
    "we have shown that even when the hamiltonian conserved charges remain insensitive to the addition of boundary and topological terms , the corresponding noetherian charges _ do _ depend on such choices .",
    "this has as a consequence that the identification of noether charges with , say , energy depends on the details of the boundary terms one has added . for instance , if one only had an internal boundary ( and no asymptotic region ) , several possibilities for the action are consistent , and the relation between energy and noether charge depends on such choices .",
    "we have also seen that one particular topological terms , namely the euler term , contributes non - trivially to the noether charge at the horizon .",
    "our analysis was done using the covariant hamiltonian formalism , that has proved to be economical and powerful to unravel the hamiltonian structure of classical gauge field theories",
    ". it should be interesting to perform a similar analysis using a 3 + 1 decomposition of spacetime and taking special care on the effects of boundaries , extending the analysis of @xcite , where the boundaries were ignored .",
    "a natural question is whether the two hamiltonian approaches to treat this system are equivalent and , if not , understand the underlying reasons for that discrepancy .",
    "this work is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
