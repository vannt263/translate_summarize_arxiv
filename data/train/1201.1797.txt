    "it is well known that for the _ kerr _ and _ reissner  nordstrm _ families of spacetimes , then unless the rotation or charge parameter vanishes , the maximal globally hyperbolic region @xmath0 determined ( as a solution to the cauchy problem for the einstein or einstein  maxwell system , respectively ) by initial data is smoothly extendible to a larger spacetime @xmath1 so that _ all _ future incomplete causal geodesics @xmath2 in @xmath3 pass into the extension @xmath4 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath3 in @xmath5 defines what is known as a _ cauchy horizon _ ( denoted @xmath6 ) and is in fact a bifurcate null hypersurface . in the case of reissner ",
    "nordstrm , this situation can be illustrated formally in the well - known penrose diagrammatic notation : @xmath7    the above situation may be considered to be undesirable from the physical or epistemological point of view as it means that the fate of classical observers is not determined by what ( from local considerations ) would appear to be an impeccable initial hypersurface @xmath8 .",
    "the question will not easily go away in view of a celebrated result of penrose  @xcite which implies in particular that if one perturbs the initial data on @xmath8 , there will still always exist observers who , like @xmath2 above , have incomplete worldlines .",
    "thus , addressing the fate of such observers who live only for a finite time is an unavoidable issue for the theory .    from the above point of view , the situation in the celebrated _ schwarzschild _ solution ( thought of as a special case of the reissner  nordstrm / kerr family corresponding to vanishing charge / rotation ) can be considered to be preferable .",
    "recall the penrose diagramme : @xmath9 here the curvature blows up along * all * incomplete inextendible causal geodesics @xmath2 as the supremum of affine time is approached , and , in fact , one can not extend nontrivially @xmath3 to an @xmath1 such that @xmath10 is a @xmath11 metric .",
    "this means that those macroscopic observers who live only for finite time do not just encounter infinite curvature but are pulled apart by an infinite tidal deformation .",
    "though perhaps not so pleasant for those observers , this situation gives the classical theory an attractive sense of `` closure '' .",
    "macroscopic observers either live forever or are destroyed ( as classically well - defined objects ) ; no one is left unaccounted for !",
    "since the schwarzschild metrics constitute a one - parameter subfamily of reissner  nordstrm or kerr , then in the class of explicit stationary solutions , it is the ( undesirable ) reissner  nordstrm / kerr behaviour that would appear to be generic .",
    "it turns out , however , that the reissner ",
    "nordstrm cauchy horizon @xmath6 is a surface of infinite _ blueshift _ , and an old heuristic argument due to simpson and penrose  @xcite suggested that this would cause it to be unstable to _ dynamic _ perturbations of the metric , which would be amplified by a blueshift effect .",
    "this motivated the so - called strong cosmic censorship conjecture :    for generic asymptotically flat initial data for `` reasonable '' einstein ",
    "matter systems , the maximal cauchy development is future inextendible as a suitably regular lorentzian manifold .    the word `` reasonable '' above is meant to exclude in particular matter models for which the analogue of the above is false even when one does not couple to gravity dimensional case , such a class can be built based on the space @xmath12 , at least for sufficiently small solutions . see the discussion in kommemi  @xcite . ] .",
    "in particular , the conjecture is meant to apply for the vacuum equations , where no matter is present .",
    "we shall comment on various formulations of ` suitably regular ' further down .    according to the above conjecture , the schwarzschild inextendibility property , though special in the class of explicit , stationary solutions , would turn out to be generic after all in the class of dynamical solutions . in particular , for this conjecture to be true , the internal structure of the black hole region of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm / kerr family would have to be unstable to perturbation of initial data .    since at the time of the formulation of the above conjecture , schwarzschild was the main example exhibiting the phenomenon postulated therein as generic , it naturally served as a basic model for the expected picture . in particular , it was expected that generically , the singular boundary of spacetime should be spacelike , meaning that typically , observers `` falling into the singularity '' eventually become causally independent , and , moreover , the singularity should be strong , meaning that the volume element ( with respect to a suitable foliation ) vanishes and macroscopic observers falling into the singularity are `` crushed '' ( cf .",
    "locally , it is well known that these properties are similar to the `` big bang '' type singularities of model cosmological spacetimes like frw or the bianchi class .",
    "( indeed , the black hole interior of schwarzschild may be considered a homogeneous `` cosmological '' solution with spatial topology @xmath13 or quotients thereof . ) motivated primarily by the cosmological case , a much cited approach to uncover the form of the `` generic singularity '' attempted to infer ( via a series of approximations ) the existence of an infinite dimensional family of spacetimes of prescribed singular behaviour with free functions , naively identifying the latter with the degrees of freedom of initial data  @xcite .",
    "this approach was extremely influential in shaping a ` standard ' picture of the interiors of generic black holes , represented by the schwarzschild penrose diagramme , but where the singularity exhibits behaviour as prescribed in  @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes known as the bkl scenario .",
    "this neat ` standard picture ' of spacetime singularities fell apart ( at least as a universal prescription ) thanks to the careful study of what turned out to be a very fruitful class of toy models , namely spherically symmetric models of collapse in the presence of charge .",
    "these are the simplest models which on the one hand allow for the formation of cauchy horizons ( i.e.  they admit reissner  nordstrm as a particular solution ) , while on the other hand , provide a dynamic degree of freedom on which the blue - shift mechanism can operate and affect a backreaction on the metric .",
    "there is in fact a hierarchy of progressively more complicated spherically symmetric charged models one can consider . by",
    "far the simplest model quantifying backreaction is that of a self - gravitating ingoing null dust . here",
    "the spacetime can be described by an explicit solution , the _ reissner  nordstrm  vaidya _ metric .",
    "this was studied already in 1981 by hiscock  @xcite .",
    "these solutions admit a null boundary across which the spacetime is extendible continuously .",
    "all curvature scalars remain bounded on the boundary , suggesting at first instance that the spacetime is regular there , just as for the reissner ",
    "nordstrm cauchy horizon ; more careful analysis quickly reveals that various components blow up with respect to a freely falling frame .",
    "thus , continuous spacetime extensions beyond the boundary fail to have @xmath14 metric , and the boundary can be viewed as a null singularity , whose singular nature is however not manifest in curvature scalars . in the language of  @xcite ,",
    "it is a `` whimper '' .",
    "the above model can easily be criticised in that it does not allow for any sort of backscattering of radiation .",
    "this fact , coupled perhaps with the general expectation that `` whimper '' singularities are unstable  @xcite , led to the null geometry of the singularity not receiving the attention it deserved .",
    "in seminal work , poisson and israel  @xcite `` irradiated '' the above spacetime with a second `` outgoing '' null dust , starting at a retarded time subsequent to the event horizon .",
    "the future evolution can no longer be represented as an explicit solution , but poisson and israel were nonetheless able to deduce that the hawking mass would diverge on the null boundary as soon as one entered the domain of influence of the second null dust  hence _ `` mass inflation''_. the divergence of the hawking mass implied in particular that the kretschmann scalar diverged  thus , the null boundary turned into a stronger `` curvature singularity '' ( in the language of  @xcite ) .",
    "it turned out , however , that the most interesting aspect of the singularity of poisson and israel  @xcite was not that it was `` stronger '' than that of hiscock  @xcite , but rather , as shown by ori  @xcite , that it too was `` weak '' , now from the point of tipler s classification  @xcite .",
    "specifically , ori  @xcite studied a slightly more tractable model where the ingoing null dust was replaced by a shell , and in the context of this model , showed that the backreaction _ would not be sufficient _ to immediately contract the area of the symmetry spheres to @xmath15 , in fact , the metric would remain well behaved on the null boundary and could continue beyond .",
    "this implies in particular that macroscopic objects might not be `` destroyed '' by the singularity .",
    "in retrospect , as we shall see , the proper characterization of the singularity in all of the above models  @xcite is not at the level of blow up of the curvature but at the level of the non - square integrability of the christoffel symbols .",
    "this notion is perhaps less familiar than the traditional classifications of singularity  @xcite , but more relevant to pde properties governing the dynamics of the einstein equations as well as the equations of continuum matter , for which the pointwise blow - up of curvature per se is of no particular significance  @xcite . from this point of view , all above examples are in fact at the _ same _ level of singularity , which , though fully deserving of the appelation `` weak '' in view of the properties discovered by ori  @xcite , is at the same time sufficiently strong so as to be `` terminal '' .",
    "we shall return to this issue after discussing the results for einstein  maxwell  real scalar field model in section  [ proofofmassinflation ] .",
    "see in particular footnote  [ uposnmeiwsn ] .      while better than the vaidya model of  @xcite , the above models  @xcite are still open to criticism .",
    "backscattering is put in by hand , and only occurs strictly after horizon formation ; i.e.  the above spacetimes coincide with the model of  @xcite in a small neighborhood of @xmath16 . moreover",
    ", the rate of decay of radiation before this artificial backscattering occurs is also put in by hand .",
    "it was clear ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) that a more realistic model was necessary . in this regard ,",
    "a natural candidate was the _",
    "einstein  maxwell ",
    "real scalar field model_. here the einstein equations are coupled to the maxwell and wave equations , but the scalar field is uncharged , thus the latter two interact only through the gravitational coupling ( see section  [ themodelsec ] ) .",
    "the above model admits true wave - like behaviour and allows for the decay rate of radiation on the horizon to arise dynamically .",
    "it is a generalisation of the spherically symmetric einstein ",
    "scalar field model whose mathematical study was initiated by christodoulou leading to his seminal proofs of both weak and strong cosmic censorship  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to christodoulou s model , however , the einstein  maxwell ",
    "real scalar field equations have a peculiar feature : in view of the absence of charged matter , then for the maxwell tensor to be non trivial , a complete spacelike hypersurface must have _ two _ asymptotically flat ends , just like in maximally extended schwarzschild or reissner  nordstrm .",
    "_ we will return to this global feature in section  [ globalstarts ] as this will be central to considerations of the present paper . _ these global features _",
    "per se _ do not however directly relate to the question of existence of weak null singularities arising from the `` point '' @xmath16 of the penrose diagramme , which can be addressed restricting to an arbitrary small neighbourhood of @xmath16 .",
    "the above model was first approached numerically , starting with a study by gnedin and gnedin  @xcite .",
    "though in retrospect , the numerics of  @xcite are best viewed as inconclusive ( see the discussion of  @xcite ) , the authors themselves interpreted their results as suggesting that the entire singular boundary is spacelike , casting doubt on the mass - inflation / weak null singularity scenario .",
    "the heuristic study of the scalar field model by bonnano  _ et al _",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , gave arguments in favour of the scenario .",
    "this was followed finally by more careful numerical work by brady ",
    "smith  @xcite , starting from data on the horizon , and later burko  @xcite starting from characteristic data on a cone terminating on null infinity ; the results of these later numerics supported the picture proposed by poisson ",
    "israel and ori of a non - empty piece of null boundary emanating from @xmath16 on which the mass blows up but across which the metric is continuously extendible .",
    "the mass - inflation scenario and the associated weak null singularities were finally mathematically proven in  @xcite to indeed occur in the einstein  maxwell  real scalar field model .",
    "the first result concerns the persistence of a piece of null boundary of spacetime :    [ thes1 ] for arbitrary asymptotically flat spherically symmetric data for the einstein  maxwell  real scalar field system for which the scalar field decays suitably at spatial infinity @xmath17 , then if the charge is non - vanishing and the event horizon @xmath18 is asymptotically subextremal , it follows that the penrose diagramme contains a subset which is as below @xmath19 where @xmath6 is a non - empty piece of null boundary .",
    "moreover , the spacetime can be continued beyond @xmath6 to a strictly larger manifold with @xmath11 lorentzian metric , to which the scalar field also extends continuously .",
    "the @xmath11 extendibility statement captures the `` weakness '' of the singularity discussed by ori in the context of  @xcite .",
    "the above thus suggests that if by ` sufficiently regular ' in the formulation of strong cosmic censorship , one only requires that the metric extend @xmath11 ( see  @xcite ) , then the conjecture is false .",
    "the proof of the above mathematical theorem appeals in particular to the fact that price s law tails hold as an * upper * bound for the behaviour of the scalar field on the horizon @xmath18 , a statement which in turn was proven in joint work with rodnianski  @xcite . see theorem  [ plt ] of section  [ persistence ] . if such a polynomial decay rate is also assumed as a * lower * bound ( cf .",
    "the numerical work  @xcite and conjecture  [ isitgen ] in section  [ globsingsec ] below ) , then one obtains that the null boundary piece @xmath6 is in fact singular :    [ thes2 ] if a suitable * lower * bound on the decay rate of the scalar field on the event horizon @xmath18 is assumed , then the non - empty piece of null boundary @xmath6 of theorem  [ thes1 ] is in fact a weak null singularity on which the hawking mass blows up identically . in particular , the metric can not be continued beyond @xmath6 as a @xmath14 metric .",
    "the scalar field can not be extended beyond @xmath6 as a @xmath20 function .",
    "we have stated above the @xmath14 inextendibility result for the metric because it is the easiest to give a self - contained proof in view of the fact that curvature is a geometric invariant .",
    "one expects to be able to make a much stronger statement , however , namely that _ _ the metric can in fact not be continued beyond @xmath6 as a continuous metric with christoffel symbols in @xmath21 . _",
    "particular _ extension with continuous metric .",
    "] this notion of inextendibility , though not sufficient to show that macroscopic observers are torn apart , ensures that the boundary of spacetime is singular enough so that one can not continue as weak solutions to a suitable einstein  matter system . in this sense",
    ", it is sufficient to ensure a version of determinism .",
    "the above results suggest that `` inextendiblity as a lorentzian manifold with continuous metric and with christoffel symbols in @xmath21 '' may be the correct formulation of `` inextendible as a suitably regular lorentzian metric '' in the statement of strong cosmic censorship .",
    "this formulation is due to christodoulou .",
    "see the discussion in the introduction of  @xcite.we note that these inextendibility remarks apply equally to the models of section  [ nulldustmodels ] .",
    "in particular , from this point of view , the singularity in the model studied by hiscock  @xcite is not really less singular than that of poisson ",
    "israel  @xcite , when both are examined primarily from the perspective of the blow - up of their christoffel symbols . in this regard , see also the discussion in  @xcite . ]",
    "we remark finally that there is an additional level in the hierarchy of spherically symmetric models which one can consider  namely the einstein  maxwell_complex _ scalar field system . in this model ,",
    "the scalar field carries charge which can source the maxwell field , and thus charged black holes can form in collapse from data which are topologically euclidean and contain no horizons .",
    "this model has been studied numerically in  @xcite while results similar to theorem  [ thes1 ] ( conditional , however , on an analogue of theorem  [ plt ] ) have been obtained in upcoming work of kommemi  @xcite .      as we have already discussed in section  [ themodels ] ,",
    "in contrast to the model of  @xcite just referred to , the einstein  maxwell ",
    "real scalar field system is such that for the maxwell tensor to be non - trivial , complete initial data necessarily will have two asymptotically flat ends .",
    "the theorems of the previous section only probed the structure of the boundary of spacetime in a neighbourhood of @xmath16 . _ what about the remaining boundary ? _ this will be the subject of the present paper .    a preliminary result , using the fact that the matter model is , in the language of  @xcite , `` strongly tame '' , implies that , if the initial data hypersurface @xmath8 is moreover assumed to be `` future admissible '' ( see section  [ genframsec ] ) , this boundary in general is as below : @xmath22 where in addition to the null boundary components @xmath6 emanating from @xmath16 , on which @xmath23 is bounded below ( at this level of generality , _ these components are possibly empty _ , but are indeed non - empty if theorem  [ thes1 ] applies ) , there is an ( again , _ possibly empty ! _ )  achronal boundary on which @xmath23 extends continuously to @xmath15 , depicted above as the thicker - shaded dotted line .",
    "see proposition  [ frameprop ] for a precise statement .",
    "note that the boundary decomposition implicit in the above diagramme already represents a non - trivial statement about possible singularity formation , as it excludes in particular `` first '' singularities corresponding to tips with compact intersection with @xmath8 and whose spherically symmetric spheres do not contract in the limit to zero area . in view of the topology of the initial data and the monotonicity properties inherent in the einstein equations",
    ", it follows that @xmath24 has ( as depicted ) a non - empty complement and @xmath25 is complete .",
    "thus , in particular , the above result contains the statement of `` weak '' cosmic censorship .    in this short paper",
    ", it is shown that when one restricts to suitably small perturbations of sub - extremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm , the @xmath26 boundary * is in fact empty * , and the two null components join to form a bifurcate null boundary across which the spacetime is globally extendible as a manifold with @xmath11 lorentzian metric ( to which the scalar field also extends continuously ) ! moreover , if the assumption of theorem  [ thes2 ] holds on both components of the event horizon @xmath18 , then the hawking mass blows up _ identically _ on this bifurcate null boundary and the spacetime is _ inextendible _ as a lorentzian manifold with @xmath14 metric , the scalar field is intextendible as an @xmath27 function , and in fact , one can make a statement about the blow up of the @xmath28 norm of the christoffel symbols . specifically :    [ introtheo ] let @xmath29 be the maximal development of sufficiently small spherically symmetric perturbations of asymptotically flat two - ended data corresponding to subextremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm with parameters @xmath30 , under the evolution of the einstein  maxwell  real scalar field system .",
    "then there exists a later cauchy surface @xmath31 which is future - admissible and such that to the future of @xmath31 , the penrose diagramme of @xmath0 is given by : @xmath32    similarly , there exists also an earlier cauchy surface @xmath33 which is past - admissible , such that to the past of @xmath33 , the penrose diagramme of @xmath0 is given by a time reversed depiction of the above , with boundary components @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc .    the global bound @xmath36 holds for the area - radius @xmath23 of the spherically symmetric spheres , where @xmath37 as the ` size ' of the perturbation tends to @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the metric extends continuously beyond @xmath6 to a strictly larger lorentzian manifold @xmath1 , making @xmath6 a bifurcate null hypersurface in @xmath5 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath38 extends to a continuous function on @xmath5 .",
    "all future - incomplete causal geodesics in @xmath3 extend to enter @xmath5 .",
    "finally , if @xmath38 satisfies the assumption of theorem  [ thes2 ] on both components of the horizon @xmath18 , then the hawking mass extends `` continuously '' to @xmath39 on all of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is future inextendible as a spacetime with @xmath14 lorentzian metric , and continuous extensions @xmath38 as in the previous paragraph fail to be @xmath27 in a neighborhood of every point of @xmath40 .",
    "exactly analogous statements hold for @xmath41 , @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , one can hope to show that , under the assumption of theorem  [ thes2 ] , given an extension @xmath1 with @xmath11 metric , the christoffel symbols fail to be @xmath42 everywhere on @xmath6 , and , wherever @xmath43 is not locally constant , the christoffel symbols in fact fail to be locally @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the latter holds in a neighbourhood of @xmath44 . as in  @xcite , we will here , however , only show these statements _ for a particular @xmath11 extension _ and not address the geometric issues in generalising this for all such extensions .",
    "if one only considered , say , future evolution , the proof of the stability part of the above theorem would be much easier ( but much less interesting ) if one moreover restricted to data which is supported strictly between the two components of the future event horizon @xmath18 , as such solutions would coincide with reissner ",
    "nordstrm in a neighbourhood of @xmath16 . evolving to the past",
    ", however , this property would be lost .",
    "we have stated our result as a statement about both future and past evolution to emphasise that we are not dealing with that essentially uninteresting case .",
    "in fact , our smallness condition does not require that @xmath38 be initially of compact support .",
    "the analogy of the reissner  nordstrm and kerr families suggests that the situation for solutions of the vacuum equations ( with no symmetry assumed ! ) in a neighbourhood of the kerr family may be similar .",
    "this is further supported by a perturbative analysis by ori  @xcite .",
    "one may thus conjecture :    [ introconj ] let @xmath0 be the maximal vacuum cauchy development of sufficiently small perturbations of asymptotically flat two - ended kerr data corresponding to parameters @xmath45 .",
    "then there exist both a future and past extension @xmath1 of @xmath3 with @xmath11 metric @xmath10 such that @xmath46 is a bifurcate null cone in @xmath5 and * all * future ( past ) incomplete geodesics in @xmath2 pass into @xmath47",
    ".    moreover , for generic such perturbations , any @xmath11 extension @xmath5 will fail to have @xmath28 christoffel symbols in a neighbourhood of any point of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , according to the above conjecture , not only should black holes generically have part and  [ thes2 ] , should apply to generic black holes forming in collapse from one asymptotically flat end , in view of the fact that it is believed that these always approach kerr in a neighbourhood of @xmath16 in the domain of outer communications",
    ". the above conjecture can not however address the * global * structure of the boundary of such spacetimes as these are * globally * far from the kerr family .",
    "we note , for instance , that the numerical work of  @xcite in the context of the spherically symmetric charged scalar field model suggests , in addition to a null component , also a non - empty spacelike portion of the singularity in the case of collapse of data with one end .",
    "see also conjecture  1.11 of  @xcite and subsequent comments therein .",
    "] of their singular boundary null , but a small neighbourhood ( in the moduli space of vacuum metrics ) of the kerr family would , in both future and past , generically * be entirely free of spacelike singularities*.    we end this introduction with a final remark : until a few years ago , `` large data '' problems for the einstein vacuum equations without symmetry seemed mathematically intractable .",
    "this view changed completely with the seminal work of christodoulou  @xcite on black hole formation in vacuum , which demonstrated how largeness can be `` tolerated '' in the analysis as long as it appears in a controlled way and is `` coupled '' with a corresponding `` smallness '' . in broad terms",
    ", this is in fact quite reminiscent of structure that plays a role in the analysis here .",
    "an even more directly related link is provided by the recent luk ",
    "rodnianski theory  @xcite of interacting impulsive gravitational waves , reviewed briefly in section  [ lukrodtheory ] of this paper , which illuminates a new hiearchy in the vacuum equations which is almost certainly key to understanding solutions in the presence of null singularities .",

    "the role of theorem  [ plt ] ) , give hope that conjecture  [ introconj ] , and its `` cosmological twin '' conjecture  [ cosmocon]but also , quite ominously , conjecture  [ cosmocon2]both stated in section  [ epilogue ] , will soon be amenable to mathematical analysis .",
    "the einstein  maxwell(real)-scalar field system describes the interaction of a gravitational field , an electromagnetic field , and an uncharged scalar field .",

    "in a different guise , `` weak null singularities '' have a long history in general relativity .",
    "they occur in the explicit colliding plane wave spacetimes constructed by khan ",

    ", however , the singularities are even * weaker * than the `` weak null singularities '' of our theorem  [ thes2 ] , in that the christoffel symbols remain bounded . in view of this",
    ", the plane waves of  @xcite were not interpreted as terminal singular boundaries of spacetime , but rather as singular hypersurfaces in an ambient spacetime continuing on both sides of the hypersurface , whose dynamics should still be uniquely prescribed by the einstein equations , interpreted in a weak sense . i.e.  the situation should be much like that for well known shock fronts of classical fluid dynamics , where the equations uniquely determine the dynamics ( after imposing in addition a suitable entropy condition ) .    a mathematical theory incorporating the above ( and more general ! )",
    "singular hypersurfaces has only been achieved very recently .",
    "the reason this problem is so difficult is that this type of singularity , despite being sufficiently `` weak '' so as to allow for the spacetimes to be interpreted as weak solutions of the einstein equations across the singularity , is still below the general well - posedness regularity threshold for the einstein equations ( even after the recent seminal improvement due to klainerman",
    " rodnianski ",
    "szeftel  @xcite requiring only that the metric be in the sobolev space @xmath465 on a cauchy surface ) . in remarkable very recent work of luk ",
    "rodnianski  @xcite , a well - posedness result has been achieved for the characteristic initial value problem with characteristic data admitting a delta - function singularity of the curvature across a @xmath62-sphere , but otherwise smooth .",
    "this singularity is then shown to propagate along a null hypersurface emanating from the @xmath62-sphere .",
    "these null singular hypersurfaces can be thought of as impulsive gravitational waves , generalising the plane symmetric examples of khan  penrose and imbedding them finally in a dynamical framework for which uniqueness is understood .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite , luk and rodnianski show that two impulsive gravitational waves interact so that the singularity is supported in the union of two null cones . in particular , a singularity does not form before their intersection , and their `` wake '' is completely regular !    although as we have said , the null singularities of luk  rodnianski are less singular than the weak null singularities of the present paper ( as they must be to allow for a well posedness theorem for spacetimes continuing beyond them ! ) , it is impossible not to compare the situation established in  @xcite with the picture of theorem  [ introtheo ] , where again two weak null singularities propagate and interact ( albeit now as the terminal boundary of spacetime ) without a `` stronger '' singularity occuring first.@xmath104 and solve only the `` evolution '' equations @xmath333@xmath388 , then one may still reasonably interpret the evolution equations alone in a generalised sense _ across _",
    "@xmath6 , and extend the spacetime so as to satisfy these .",
    "the hypersurfaces @xmath114 can then be thought of precisely as interacting singularities in such a spacetime , which again would effectively pass through one another .",
    "it is interesting that it is specifically the impossibility of satisfying the constraint equations that exclude such extensions from being thought of as weak solutions of the einstein equations . in this sense , the constraint equations can be thought to play a role analogous to that of an entropy condition in classical continuum physics . ]",
    "the methods introduced by  @xcite thus give hope that * vacuum * spacetimes with singular structure similar to that of theorem  [ introtheo ] ( and without underlying symmetries ) will soon be constructed , parameterised by free initial data .",
    "this will be an important first step toward understanding the validity of conjecture  [ introconj ] .",
    "as discussed before , the original expectation of `` bkl''-type behaviour inside black hole regions starts from the observation that locally the interior of a schwarzschild black hole can be viewed as a cosmological region .",
    "this relation goes both ways , however .",
    "in particular , perturbing the reissner  nordstrm  de sitter solution , similar considerations to reissner ",
    "nordstrm apply .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the situation is even more interesting , and the conclusions for strong cosmic censorship potentially ominous .",
    "let us first state a basic stability result , an exact analogue of the stability part of theorem  [ introtheo ] , which can be proven following the methods of this paper and  @xcite , depends on a relatively rough understanding for the decay properties of the scalar field between the event and cosmological horizons , and holds for all subextremal values of the reissner  nordstrm  de sitter solution .",
    "[ canbeshown ] for sufficiently small spherically symmetric perturbations of subextremal reissner  nordstrm  de sitter initial data ( with topology @xmath466 and @xmath467 black hole regions ) , the maximal future ( past ) cauchy development has penrose diagramme given by : @xmath468 and the spacetime is extendible as a manifold with @xmath11-lorentzian metric ( to which @xmath38 also extends continuously ) , such that each connected component of @xmath6 is a bifurcate null cone in the extension .",
    "the above already motivates a conjecture which is stated here in the kerr case so as to apply in fact for vacuum :    [ cosmocon ] let @xmath0 be the maximal cauchy development ( for the einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant ) of sufficiently small perturbations of subextremal kerr  de sitter data ( with @xmath467 black hole regions ) and initial topology @xmath469 . then @xmath0 is future ( past ) extendible to a @xmath1 with @xmath11 metric @xmath10 , such that @xmath46 is the union of @xmath467 bifurcate null cones , and all incomplete , future(past)-intextendible geodesics of @xmath3 pass into @xmath4 .    according to this conjecture",
    ", there is an * open set in the moduli space * of vacuum , `` cosmological '' spacetimes whose singularities , whether past or future , are * _ nowhere _",
    "spacelike*.      the question of the precise generic singular nature of the null boundary of these spacetimes is more delicate and depends on the parameters of the reissner  nordstrm ",
    "de sitter spacetime which is initially perturbed .",
    "this problem was plagued by much confusion and several incorrect claims .",
    "the original studies of the charged spherical toy models gave a detailed analysis of the expected singular behaviour , identifying a parameter range ( i ) where the mass inflation scenario holds just as in the asymptotically flat case , a parameter range ( ii ) where the curvature blows up without the mass blowing up , and , finally , and most surprisingly , a parameter range ( iii ) where the curvature remains continuous .",
    "see in particular  @xcite and the survey  @xcite .",
    "these original studies  @xcite , however , had failed to properly address the effect of backscattering in the region between the cosmological and event horizons , already present in the scalar field model , which heuristically generates an exponentially decaying tail with the slower exponential rate governed by the surface gravity of the _ event horizon _ , as opposed to the faster rate governed by the surface gravity of the _ cosmological horizon_. when this was taken into account , the range of stability ( iii ) predicted in  @xcite disappears .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the `` @xmath14-inextendibility formulation '' of strong cosmic censorship holds in the case of positive cosmological constant  hence the reassuring title of  @xcite .",
    "subsequent insights  @xcite into the proper formulation of strong cosmic censorship coming from the pde point of view , coupled with the recent luk ",
    "rodnianski theory  @xcite described in the previous section , suggest that@xcite not withstanding  one should revisit the more detailed previous analyses of the studies described just above .",
    "a revised heuristic analysis in the spirit of  @xcite but correctly taking into account the behaviour of the scalar field outside the event horizon  @xcite suggests that there is still a qualitative difference in the nature of the blow - up , depending on the parameters , corresponding to ( i ) and ( ii ) above .",
    "in particular , close to extremality , this suggests that although the curvature blows up , _ this is not associated with mass blow up _ , and , particularly relevant to the point of view advanced here , the metric in fact extends lipschitz ( its christoffel symbols are uniformly bounded ) , and the scalar field extends in @xmath27 .    in theorem  [ canbeshown ] , if the initial data is sufficiently close to a reissner  nordstrm",
    " de sitter with parameters in turn sufficiently close to extremal ( but still subextremal ! ) , then the spacetime extensions @xmath1 can be chosen so that @xmath10 is lipschitz , and such that the scalar field extends to @xmath5 as an @xmath27 function .",
    "for generic such initial data ( for all sub - extremal values of the reissner  nordstrm ",
    "de sitter reference solution ) , @xmath10 can not be @xmath14 and @xmath38 can not extend @xmath424 .",
    "in fact , the linearised analysis suggests that the scalar field will extend in @xmath470 , where one can take @xmath471 as the initial data approaches extremality .",
    "it is slightly amusing that the closer the black hole is to extremality , the more `` stable '' its cauchy horizon , when set against the backdrop of the novel instability discovered by aretakis  @xcite in his study of the wave equation on exactly extreme reissner  nordstrm ; this then suggests that , as the parameters of the initial reference reissner ",
    "de sitter are pushed towards extremality , the size of the allowed `` open set '' in the moduli space of data , corresponding to the domain of stability , must be taken to shrink .",
    "when `` translated '' to the vacuum case ( see the comments at the end of section  [ ssred ] ) one may expect that the @xmath424 blow up of the scalar field will be reflected as a @xmath11 blow up of the christoffel symbols , and thus , the metric will not be lipschitz .",
    "on the other hand , the above still suggests that the christoffel symbols will be in @xmath21 ( in fact , in any @xmath472 , given data sufficiently close to extremality ) .",
    "this would represent a type of singularity which , although outside the general @xmath465-well posedness theory of  @xcite , may be describable by a suitable generalisation of luk  rodnianski theory  @xcite outlined in the previous section , and thus such solutions may in fact admit a local uniqueness characterization .",
    "thus , one is led to :    [ cosmocon2 ] let @xmath0 be the maximal cauchy development of sufficiently small perturbations of kerr  de sitter data ( with @xmath467 black hole regions ) and initial topology @xmath469 with parameters sufficiently close to extremality",
    ". then one can choose extensions @xmath1 as above such that @xmath10 has locally square integrable christoffel symbols and such that moreover the extensions satisfy the einstein equations in a generalised sense .",
    "in particular , the `` inextendible as a metric with @xmath21 christoffel symbols '' formulation ( see  @xcite ) of strong cosmic censorship does not hold in the case of positive cosmological constant .    from a sufficiently coarse point of view , the spacetimes @xmath0 described by the above conjecture would be stable examples of * cosmological black hole spacetimes without singularities ",
    "full stop*.      it may be tempting , in view of conjecture  [ cosmocon2 ] , to prefer the @xmath14 formulation of strong cosmic censorship , and to invoke the pointwise blow - up of curvature as an indication that the effects of quantum gravity will somehow save the day . until that time where such considerations can be well formulated ,",
    "however , the local pde - properties governing the cauchy problem for the einstein equations provide the best insight into the theory that we have , and its conclusions  like them or not  cannot be taken lightly .",
    "thus , these considerations suggest that while the uniqueness property captured by strong cosmic censorship may indeed hold in the realm of gravitational collapse , its validity as a fundamental physical principle now appears in doubt .",
