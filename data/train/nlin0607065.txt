    ". it might be natural to regard this structure as originating from the asymmetry of the root lattice .",
    "actually in other cases where this situation arises , such as the @xmath265 surface(``@xmath0-p@xmath266 '' and `` @xmath0-p@xmath267 '' , @xmath268-symmetry)@xcite , @xmath269 surface(``@xmath0-p@xmath270 '' , @xmath269-symmetry)@xcite or @xmath271 surface(``@xmath0-p@xmath272 '' , @xmath273-symmetry)@xcite , the determinant structure is symmetric .",
    "such an asymmetric structure of the determinant is known for several discrete painlev equations - one example is the `` standard '' discrete painlev ii equation@xcite @xmath274 where @xmath275 are parameters . equation ( [ eq : standard_dp2 ] ) may be regarded as a special case of the `` asymmetric '' discrete painlev ii equation@xcite @xmath276 when @xmath167 , which is actually a discrete painlev equation associated with the @xmath273 surface and arises as a bcklund transformation of the painlev v equation ( p@xmath270 ) .",
    "therefore the hypergeometric solutions for ( [ eq : asymmetric_dp2 ] ) are expressible in terms of the whittaker function and are the same as those for p@xmath270@xcite .",
    "however , the hypergeometric solutions for eq.([eq : standard_dp2 ] ) are quite different ; the relevant hypergeometric function is the parabolic cylinder function and the determinant structure has the same asymmetry as that for dp(@xmath8 ) eq.([eq : qp2 ] ) .",
    "a similar structure is known for the `` standard '' discrete ( @xmath0-)painlev iii equation ( dp@xmath267)@xcite @xmath277 and the @xmath0-painlev vi equation ( @xmath0-p@xmath272 ) @xcite , @xmath278 where @xmath279 , @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) , @xmath282 and @xmath283 ( @xmath284 ) are parameters . the hypergeometric solutions for eq.([eq : qp6 ] ) are given by the basic hypergeometric series @xmath285 @xcite while those for eq.([eq : standard_dp3 ] ) are given by jackson s @xmath0-bessel function@xcite .",
    "thus the results of our study sheds some light on the `` degenerated '' equations such as eqs.([eq : standard_dp2 ] ) or ( [ eq : standard_dp3 ] ) .",
    "they are not just special cases of the original `` generic '' equations .",
    "our results imply that putting @xmath167 in eq.([eq : asymmetric_dp2 ] ) is not just killing the `` parity '' , but causes qualitative change of the root lattice which in turn results in different hypergeometric solutions and an asymmetry of the determinant formula .",
    "therefore they should be studied independently of the `` generic '' discrete painlev equations in the sakai s classification@xcite . + * acknowledgement * we acknowledge profs .",
