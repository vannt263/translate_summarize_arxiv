    "in the last decades , the intense theoretical and experimental investigations of the qcd phase diagram in the regime of partonic and hadronic gas phases led us to the picture depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the dashed - dotted red ( online ) line represents the crossover from quark gluon plasma to the hadronic state procured from the lattice qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "the experiemntal measurement of hadronic species abundances allows us to outline the dotted blue ( online ) line as the chemical freeze - out of the hadronic gas .",
    "it is remarkable that at low baryo - chemical potential that two curves overlap , albeit at large @xmath2 a significant gap between the temperature of the transition from the partonic to the hadronic phase , @xmath8 , and the temperature of chemical freeze - out is predicted .",
    "the data of elliptic flow @xcite and p/@xmath9 @xcite around midrapidity ( low @xmath2 ) have shown that the final hadronic state remembers the partonic fluid features .",
    "this is reflected in constituent quark scaling of @xmath10 and an enhancement of baryon - to - meson ratios that scales with the size of the created systems ( see @xcite , fig .",
    "these results support the view of hadronization process driven by the parton recombination @xcite with the negligible final state interactions between produced hadrons . from fig . 1",
    "one can conclude that at large @xmath2 this picture might be spoiled by the final state hadron interactions leading to the transition from parton recombination scheme to the hydrodynamical description with the common velocity field of baryons and mesons @xcite .",
    "the brahms detector setup @xcite consists of two movable , narrow spectrometer arms : the midrapidity spectrometer which operates in the polar angle interval from @xmath11 ( that corresponds in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath12 ) and the forward spectrometer that operates in the polar angle range from @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "additionally , brahms setup consists of the global detectors used to determine the overall particle multiplicity , collision vertex and centrality .",
    "the midrapidity spectrometer is composed of the single dipole magnet ( d5 ) placed between two tpcs which are made use of tracking .",
    "particle identification is based on the cherenkov detector ( c4 - signs like in @xcite ) and time of flight wall ( tofw ) measurement .",
    "the front forward arm is composed of two time projection chambers ( constituted track recognition in a high multiplicity enviroment ) , the back part - of three drift chambers and in the aggregate deliver particle track segments with high momentum resolution using three dipole magnets . to identify low momentum particles the time of flight ( hodoscope h2 )",
    "is used . for higher",
    "mometa , particle identification is provided via then ring imaging cherenkov detector , situated behind h2 hodoscope .    for data analysis",
    "we assume that acceptance and tracking efficiency are canceled in the baryon - to - meson ratio but the proton and pion yield have been corrected for pid efficiency , interactions of emitted particles with the beampipe , the spectrometers natural budget and for the decays in fly .",
    "for au+au system at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev for @xmath15 = 3.2 in comparison with p+p collisions .",
    "the errors are only statistical.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it has been already shown that the p/@xmath6 ratios at the intermediate @xmath16 range can vary very strongly depending on both charge and pseudorapidity of indicated species , as well as on energy and size of colliding system .",
    "2 , @xcite , presents the p/@xmath17 ratio at midrapidity for au+au at @xmath0 = 200 gev ( @xmath2 = 26 mev ) in comparison with theoretical predictions based on parton recombination model @xcite and hydrodynamical descritpion .",
    "the characteristic growth at intermediate @xmath16 region , predicted by above - mentioned descriptions , seems to be more consistent with the depiction of recombination model .",
    "the hydrodynamic scenario , proposed in @xcite , describes properly only the low momentum data associated mainly with the soft component .",
    "fig . 2 compares the p/@xmath6 ratio from p+p and au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev and @xmath15 = 3.2 ( @xmath18 250 mev , @xcite ) .",
    "unexpected high value of 10 at @xmath16 = 1.5 gev / c of proton - to - meson ratio @xcite is observed .",
    "there is remarkably little difference in the pi / p ratios from a very wide range of systems .",
    "this is in contrast to the trends at midrapidity and forward rapidity regimes for au+au at @xmath0 = 200 gev where significant medium effect of baryon - to - meson ratios depending on system size is seen .",
    "however , it must be admitted that at forward pseudorapidity a lot of protons come from beam fragmentation , that high value of proton - to - pion ratio for all intervals of centrality for nucleus - nucleus collisions is a puzzle indicating that mechanism of baryons - to - mesons production is taking place rather on elementary interaction domain .",
    "3 presents the au+au collisions for @xmath15 = 0.0 at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev marked with open red ( online ) triangles and the au+au reactions for @xmath15 = 2.2 at @xmath0 = 200 gev marked with the black triangles .",
    "the selection of pseudorapidity intervals namely @xmath15 = 0.0 for au+au @ 62.4 gev and @xmath15 = 2.2 for au+au @ 200 gev allow to obtain overlap in @xmath19 , thus @xmath2 , for the observed phase space of system at various energies . as indicated in fig .",
    "1 the shown data are measured at @xmath20= @xmath21 = 62 mev .",
    "considerably lower value depicted by grey stars displays the p/@xmath22 ratio for p+p system at @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "the astonishing conformity proton - to - pion ratios for collate heavy ions collisions evidences that the baryon and meson production at the covered @xmath16 interval is dominated by medium effects .",
    "these effects can be seen throughout the observed enhancement of p/@xmath17 for nucleus - nucleus systems with reference to the results for elementary interactions .",
    "the data infer possible scaling of baryon - to - meson ratio with baryo - chemical potential for dense systems .",
    "in addition it is presented the comparison with therminator model with well - defined collective expansion and successive evaporation of hadrons from the hypersurface of the fireball @xcite .",
    "the errors are only statistical.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "concluding , the brahms experiment has presented the proton - to - pion ratios in au+au and p+p collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev and @xmath0 = 200 gev as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality . as it has been shown",
    "the indicated data give the possibility of studying baryon and meson production in the wide range of baryo - chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "for au+au and p+p measurement at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev for @xmath15 = 3.2 the astounding value of p/@xmath17 ratio has been noted . at these energy and pseudorapidity interval",
    "no centrality dependency of p/@xmath6 ratio is observed .",
    "furthermore , the baryon - to - meson ratio of nucleus - nucleus data are consistent with results obtained for elementary p+p reactions .",
