    "fast and ultra - sensitive displacement and force detection is of great interest for a broad range of fundamental applications .",

    "standard quantum limit \" ( sql ) @xmath4 , and in the radio - frequency range .",
    "considering , for instance , a micron - sized cantilever with a resonant frequency of @xmath2 and quality factor @xmath3 , the detection of quantum squeezed states requires a displacement sensitivity of about @xmath0.@xcite as another example , in detecting single - spin magnetic resonance , the interaction force between a nano - magnet with a targeted electron spin is typically on the order of about @xmath5.@xcite if a micron - sized cantilever on which the nano - magnet is mounted is directly coupled at the spin precession frequency ( @xmath2 or higher ) , the magnetic force will cause the cantilever to oscillate at an amplitude of about @xmath6 for a single spin .    following the development of the rf - set,@xcite it has been proposed to use an rf - set - based displacement detector for measuring sub - angstrom motion of micron - scale and smaller mechanical oscillators.@xcite in the rf - set , @xmath7 noise which limits the applications of the conventional dc - set",
    "is considerably improved .",
    "a shot noise limit of @xmath8 may be achievable by using an rf - set displacement detector,@xcite provided the coupling ( gate voltage ) between the set and micro - mechanical oscillator is strong enough .",
    "however , the back - action of the set onto the mechanical oscillator must also be taken into account:@xcite the fluctuating force acting on the oscillator due to the fluctuating island charge produces another contribution to the displacement noise .",
    "the total displacement noise will be the sum of contributions from two sources - the shot noise in the tunneling current and the force noise due to the fluctuating island charge .    in this paper , we give a calculation of the displacement noise of the rf - set displacement detector . by using the intrinsic noise analysis method of korotkov,@xcite the spectral density of the shot noise @xmath9 in the tunneling current and the spectral density of the force noise @xmath10",
    "are determined , and the total spectral density of the displacement noise @xmath11 is then deduced .",
    "we also present two simple expressions from which good estimates of the displacement noise due to the shot noise and the fluctuating island charge can be obtained .",
    "results for the ultimate intrinsic noise limit of the detector for different parameter values are presented and discussed .",
    "the displacement and force sensitivities are estimated for an optimized rf - set displacement detector and we find that they meet the requirement for detecting quantum squeezing and single - spin magnetic resonance .",
    "the scheme of the rf - set displacement detector is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the basic principle of the device involves locating one of the gate capacitor plates of the set on the cantilever so that , for fixed gate voltage bias , a mechanical displacement is converted into a polarization charge fluctuation .",
    "the stray capacitance @xmath12 of the leads contacting the set and an inductor @xmath13 form a tank circuit with resonant frequency @xmath14 , loaded by the set .",
    "a monochromatic carrier wave is sent down the cable . at the resonant frequency",
    "the circuit impedance is small and the reflected power provides a measure of the set s differential resistance @xmath15.@xcite when the gate capacitor is biased , mechanical motion of the cantilever is converted into differential resistance changes , hence modulating the reflected signal power .    to simplify the algebra and make the final results concise",
    ", we shall in fact consider a symmetric dc - set in the calculations with junction resistances @xmath16 and junction capacitances @xmath17 .",
    "the differences between the rf- and dc - set noise formulae are inessential , with appropriate time - averages required in the former@xcite resulting in only small quantitative differences in the noise values .",
    "referring to fig .  1 , when the drain - source voltage @xmath18 is small compared to the voltage @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total capacitance of the set , and also the thermal energy @xmath21 , the peaks of the tunneling current @xmath22 will be well separated in gate voltage @xmath23 . to derive an expression for @xmath22 in the tunneling region , we consider only the two most probable island electron numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 , resulting in the following approximation:@xcite @xmath26\\sigma(n)+e[b_{1}(n+1)-t_{1}(n+1)]\\sigma(n+1 ) .",

    ", we compare the displacement noise for different cantilevers .",

    "we mainly focus our attention on the detector using the cantilever with geometry @xmath66 in @xmath67 , quality factor @xmath68 , resonant frequency @xmath69 , and effective spring constant @xmath70 .",
    "the standard quantum limit of the fundamental flexural mode of this cantilever is @xmath71 , so that the minimum detectable force at the resonant frequency is @xmath72 .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the displacement noise @xmath73 on the gate voltage @xmath23 at the resonant frequency @xmath69 of cantilever .",

    "the solid line is obtained by using expressions ( [ current1 ] ) , ( [ currentnoise ] ) , and ( [ sxi ] ) and the dashed line using ( [ approxsxi ] ) .",
    "the minimum displacement noise occurs near the edges of the tunneling current @xmath22 , and decreases approximately in inverse proportion to increasing gate voltage .",
    "the displacement noise diverges in the center of tunneling current peaks and in the coulomb blockade region where the tunneling current is suppressed .",
    "the result here is similar to fig .  2 in ref .",
    "the dependence of the displacement noise @xmath80 on the gate voltage @xmath23 at the resonant frequency @xmath69 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the result assumes the same parameters as above .",

    "the maximum displacement noise increases linearly with the increasing gate voltage .",
    "4 shows the total displacement noise @xmath81 as a function of gate voltage .",
    "the tunneling current is shown as the dashed lines . considering the opposite dependences of @xmath82 and @xmath83 on gate voltage",
    ", we will expect an optimum gate voltage value for the lowest displacement noise and best sensitivity .",
    "but there are two problems involved in the determination .",
    "the first problem is that near the edges the tunneling current @xmath84 may be too small to be measured accurately .",
    "the second is that because @xmath82 and @xmath83 change in different ways with increasing gate voltage @xmath23 , it is rather involved finding the most optimum value of @xmath23 at which the total noise is minimum ; the positions of the minima in the displacement noise doublets will change relatively to the tunneling current peaks with increasing gate voltage .",
    "an alternative , simpler strategy is to investigate the displacement noise at the gate voltage for which the tunneling current is fixed and measurable , say between @xmath85 and @xmath86 of its maximum value @xmath87 . fig .",
    "5 shows the total displacement noise @xmath81 for our rf - set displacement detector using different cantilever parameter values listed in table i. the above method is utilized with the displacement noise determined where the tunneling current is half its maximum value .",
    "for the detector using a cantilever with resonant frequency @xmath69 , the minimum displacement noise is @xmath88 , corresponding to an absolute displacement sensitivity of @xmath89 and force sensitivity @xmath90 .",
    "note that the minimum displacement noise increases and shifts to lower gate voltage for increasing cantilever length . as is evident from ( [ approxsxf ] ) , this is a direct consequence of the effective spring constant dependence : obviously a stiffer cantilever will be displaced less by the same applied force .",
    "6 shows the detector displacement noise for different junction capacitance values .",
    "both @xmath82 and @xmath83 decrease with decreasing @xmath91 . because small displacements are detected by monitoring changes in tunneling current , taking a smaller junction capacitance serves another advantage for the experiment : with @xmath92 kept fixed",
    ", a smaller junction capacitance corresponds to a larger source - drain voltage , so that the maximum tunneling current @xmath87 increases according to expression ( [ currentmax ] ) .",
    "7 shows the displacement noise when the tunneling current is biased at various values between @xmath93 and @xmath94 of @xmath87 .",
    "we see that performing detection at a smaller percentage of the maximum tunneling current becomes another effective way to further decrease the displacement noise .",
    "the lowest displacement noise we obtain is @xmath95 , assuming @xmath74 , @xmath76 , and @xmath96 , biased at @xmath93 of its maximum value .",
    "the optimum gate voltage is @xmath97 in this case .    in conclusion ,",
    "approaching the sql will become possible for a carefully engineered rf - set displacement detector .",
    "a sensitivity at , or even beyond the sql may be achievable by using the same parameters as in the above analysis but with the smaller junction capacitance @xmath98 .",
    "such a sensitivity would enable us to observe quantum squeezed states in micro - mechanical systems .",
    "the proposed displacement detector also meets the crucial requirement for advances in mrfm .",
    "the radio - frequency micro - mechanical cantilever used in our model allows direct coupling at the spin precession frequency , therefore allowing fast read - out , while the predicted force sensitivity would allow the measurement of single - spin resonance .",
