    "the problem of electron - electron interactions in bilayer graphene has been of great interest both experimentally and theoretically , especially the problem of what interaction - induced spontaneous symmetry - breaking orders appear . in particular",
    ", we refer to two recent works@xcite by one of the authors where the role of electron - electron interaction in producing novel emergent quantum phases in gapless bilayer graphene was discussed in great detail using the renormalization group ( rg ) theoretical approach .",
    "the current work is a generalization of this previous work@xcite to an experimentally relevant situation where the layer symmetry is broken explicitly by an external electric field so that the non - interacting energy spectrum has an energy gap , and thus the starting bilayer graphene system is a semiconductor with a gap rather than a gapless semimetal as in refs .  .",
    "the original motivation for studying the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking theoretically was twofold .",
    "first of all , near two special points in the brillouin zone , labeled @xmath0 , the electronic bands make contact with each other at four dirac - like cones@xcite ( trigonal warping ) .",
    "if we ignore all but the nearest - neighbor hopping , however , then these cones merge into parabolic degeneracies . in two dimensions ,",
    "this parabolic dispersion results in a logarithmic divergence of the ( non - interacting ) susceptibilities to various symmetry - breaking orders at zero temperature .",
    "second of all , the fact that the susceptibilities to many different orders are all divergent makes the problem of determining which will appear once interactions are taken into account interesting and technically challenging .",
    "when one accounts for trigonal warping , however , the logarithmic divergences of the susceptibilities will be cut off .",
    "nevertheless , symmetry - breaking order is still possible , even with trigonal warping@xcite .",
    "much theoretical work has already been done on this problem using a variety of methods .",
    "in addition to numerous mean - field studies@xcite , many of which consider the effects of applied electric and magnetic fields , as well as numerical work@xcite , a few studies have employed rg techniques as we do @xcite . while most of these consider the problem at zero temperature , two of them@xcite treat the problem at finite temperature .",
    "the first of these@xcite is dedicated to mapping out the possible leading instabilities toward spontaneous symmetry breaking , while the second@xcite considers the leading instability for finite - range interactions as a function of overall interaction strength and range .",
    "this second paper finds that the system is unstable to a layer antiferromagnetic phase for short - range interactions , in which the electronic spins enter a ferrimagnetic arrangement in each layer , with the overall polarizations of each layer oppositely directed@xcite , to a nematic phase for long - range interactions , in which the rotational symmetry of the system is broken and the electronic spectrum is reconstructed to have two dirac cones , and instabilities to both for intermediate - range interactions .",
    "the short - range result agrees with that obtained in ref .  , and the long - range result with that obtained in refs .  , , and .",
    "in addition , a more recent rg study considers the effect of a finite chemical potential@xcite , while all of the other rg studies only considered the half - filled case , as we will be doing here .",
    "there are also a number of experiments@xcite that claim to see signatures of symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene .",
    "most of these observe a gap , but one@xcite performed on an especially clean sample ( reported mobility on the order of @xmath1 ) sees evidence for a nematic phase .",
    "the rest of the experiments , which observe gaps , are inconclusive about the exact nature of the gapped phase .",
    "two of these experiments@xcite have also looked at electric field effects and find that the gap closes for a sufficiently strong electric field applied in either direction .    a great deal of both experimental and theoretical work has also been done on various possible quantum hall phases in bilayer graphene in the presence of an applied perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we do not consider or discuss the bilayer graphene quantum hall phases at all in the current work since the quantum hall physics is qualitatively different from the zero magnetic field situation of our interest because of the quenching of the non - interacting kinetic energy .",
    "all quantum hall phenomena are well beyond the scope of this work .",
    "as is implied in this summary of the previous work , the effect of an electric field on symmetry - breaking orders has been studied in some earlier works experimentally and , at the mean - field level , theoretically .",
    "while the problem has been addressed to a limited extent using rg methods@xcite , we wish to perform a comprehensive rg - based study of the effect of an electric field on the system .",
    "we therefore dedicate this work to extending the previous finite - temperature rg work@xcite to include the effect of an electric field applied perpendicular to the sample .",
    "in particular , we will determine what effect the presence of such a field has on the possible leading instabilities that the system can in principle exhibit , as well as how this field affects the instabilities that the system shows for a microscopic finite - range electron - electron interaction ( i.e. , for initial coupling constants corresponding to a finite - range interaction term present in the original tight - binding model ) .",
    "our main reason for embarking on a comprehensive rg study analyzing the effect of an external electric field on the interaction - driven instabilities in bilayer graphene is the possibility that such an analysis will enable a direct and unambiguous experimental determination of the quantum phase diagram of interacting bilayer graphene by carefully studying the experimental data as a function of the applied electric field which is fairly straightforward to carry out in the laboratory .",
    "another reason motivating our work is the question of how an existing energy gap in the non - interacting dispersion affects the quantum criticality in bilayer graphene , in particular , which symmetry - broken phases are relatively enhanced ( suppressed ) by this new tuning parameter ( i.e. , the electric field ) .",
    "given that earlier works have looked systematically at the effects of interaction range and strength , finite temperature , finite chemical potential , etc .",
    ", on the bilayer interaction - driven quantum instabilities , it makes sense for us to do the same in the presence of an external electric field , which is an adjustable parameter that can be easily controlled experimentally .",
    "we begin with a tight - binding model of bilayer graphene with a layer energy difference added to represent the effect of the applied electric field and a density - density interaction term for the electrons , from which we derive the corresponding effective low - energy theory . at first sight",
    ", it may appear that the problem becomes intractably difficult because of the explicit breaking of the layer symmetry with many new fermionic interaction terms getting generated compared with the zero electric field situation .",
    "while , in principle , the reduced symmetry of our problem would allow for additional four - fermion interaction terms beyond the nine that are possible without an electric field present@xcite , it turns out that these additional coupling constants are not generated in our rg flows unless they are present to begin with , which they are not for any realistic electron - electron interaction .",
    "therefore , the problem effectively only has the original nine coupling constants .",
    "we then make use of the same set of rg equations already derived in ref .   in the presence of an applied electric field to determine the possible fixed rays that the rg flows can tend to , along with their associated leading instabilities , as well as to determine the leading instabilities of the system for finite - range ( microscopic ) electron - electron interactions through numerical integration of the rg equations .",
    "the fact that the number of distinct coupling constants in the current problem , although large ( 9 ) , remains the same as in the previous work considerably simplifies the theoretical analysis .",
    "we only consider the case of a coulomb - like interaction screened by the presence of two parallel infinite conducting plates placed equidistant from the electron , as this corresponds to the only experimental setup that would allow one to realize a finite electric field while maintaining the system at half filling , which is precisely the problem that we are interested in : the quantum phase diagram of interacting intrinsic undoped bilayer graphene in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "we find that a number of the fixed rays present on the `` target plane , '' a two - parameter family of such fixed rays found in ref .  , are no longer valid fixed rays , but the four isolated rays found therein are still valid . in particular , we find that the region corresponding to the layer - polarized state , in which there is an imbalance of charge on one layer with respect to the other , is completely excluded , which is not surprising , considering that that phase no longer breaks any symmetries of the system since the starting non - interacting system already has a broken layer symmetry .",
    "in addition , we find five other fixed rays that are not present in the zero - field case , thus making the current problem technically more difficult than the corresponding zero - field case .",
    "we then construct a map of the leading instability ( or instabilities ) of the system as a function of overall interaction strength and interaction range for the screened coulomb - like interaction described above for four values of the electric field .",
    "we find that the sequence of instabilities that one observes is the same as in the zero - field case@xcite ; we see an antiferromagnetic instability for short - range interactions , a nematic instability for long - range interactions , and both instabilities for intermediate - range interactions . however , we find that , if the interaction is too weak or too long - ranged , then the system will exhibit no instabilities at all , in contrast to the zero - field case",
    ". the ranges at which the nematic instability first appears , at which the antiferromagnetic instability disappears , and at which the nematic instability disappears all decrease with increasing electric field .",
    "the interaction strength below which all instabilities disappear , regardless of interaction range , also increases with increasing layer energy difference .",
    "thus , a generic effect of the applied electric field is to suppress various interaction - driven instabilities , which is perhaps not surprising since we expect the electric - field - induced energy gap in the non - interacting dispersion to act as a cut off on the minimal interaction strength necessary to effect many - body instabilities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the starting model , both the tight - binding model and the corresponding effective low - energy theory .",
    "section iii is dedicated to explaining our rg analysis and how we determine the fixed rays of our system ; we also state the results for various fixed rays there .",
    "we consider the case of a microscopic finite - range interaction in sec .",
    "iv , and then present our conclusions in sec . v. we give a number of technical equations and formulas , namely , definitions of various functions and coefficients appearing in the rg equations , in the appendices .",

    "the vectors @xmath19 are the positions of the dimerized sites within a unit cell projected into the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the @xmath21 vectors are each one of the three vectors connecting an @xmath22 site to a nearest - neighbor @xmath23 site , and may take on the values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the lattice constant .",
    "whenever there is a sum on @xmath21 , we sum over these three values , while we choose one of the three values if @xmath21 appears without a summation over it .",
    "the second part of the hamiltonian , @xmath28 , is the interaction , given by @xmath29[n_k({{\\bf r}}')-1 ] \\cr & + & \\sum_{{{\\bf r}}{{\\bf r}}'}v_{\\bot}({{\\bf r}}-{{\\bf r}}')[n_1({{\\bf r}})-1][n_2({{\\bf r}}')-1].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 runs over all lattice sites , once again projected into the @xmath20 plane , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 or @xmath32 , as appropriate .",
    "we assume that the interaction @xmath33 depends only on distance , i.e. , @xmath34 . in the above expression",
    ", we define @xmath35 to be the intralayer interaction and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance between the two layers , to be the interlayer interaction .    like the system without a layer energy difference , this hamiltonian describes an undoped system at half - filling when the chemical potential is zero . while it is not invariant under a particle - hole transformation alone@xcite ,",

    ", one may prove that the total occupation number of the @xmath38 sites per unit cell is @xmath39 , as is that of the @xmath32 sites .",
    "therefore , while there will be an imbalance of occupation numbers between layers , the overall system is still at half - filling .",
    "if we now write the partition function associated with the above hamiltonian and integrate out the high - energy modes , or equivalently the dimerized sites , as the hopping between them sets the splitting of the high - energy bands in the absence of an electric field@xcite , we obtain the equivalent low - energy effective theory , which is @xmath40\\,\\exp\\left ( -\\int_{0}^{\\beta}d\\tau\\,l_{\\text{eff}}\\right ) , \\label{eq : partfunc}\\ ] ] where the lagrangian @xmath41 is @xmath42\\psi\\cr & + & \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{g}}g_s\\int d^2{{\\bf r}}\\,(\\psi^{\\dag}s\\psi)^2-\\mu'\\int d^2{{\\bf r}}\\,\\psi^{\\dag}\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : efflagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the fields @xmath43^t$ ] are eight - component grassmann spinors in layer ( 1 and 2 ) , valley ( @xmath0 ) , and spin ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) spaces and @xmath46 we omit the explicit dependence of these fields on @xmath17 and @xmath47 for brevity ; all of these fields are at the same point and imaginary time .",

    "however , it turns out that , under the rg transformation that was employed in the previous work@xcite and will be employed here , the coefficient of this term is irrelevant in the rg sense ; therefore , we do not include it in our analysis .",
    "the experimental values@xcite of the effective mass @xmath54 and of the trigonal warping velocity @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the above low - energy theory is valid up to energy scales of @xmath58 , since it is at this energy that the high - energy bands begin to affect the physics of the system , and thus where the low - energy theory breaks down .",
    "in fact , for the purpose of our later renormalization group calculations , we will impose a momentum cutoff @xmath51 corresponding to this energy scale , i.e. @xmath59 .    in the last term , the interaction term , @xmath60 is the set of @xmath61 matrices operating on valley and layer space . in the zero - field case , there are @xmath62 independent coupling constants@xcite , all multiplying these four - fermion interaction terms .",
    "these independent coupling constants correspond to representations of the @xmath63 point symmetry group of the hamiltonian at the @xmath64 point in the absence of an electric field and to representations of the @xmath65 symmetry group at the parabolic touching points , @xmath0 .",
    "application of an electric field reduces the point symmetry group of the lattice and at the @xmath64 point to @xmath66 , but leaves all other symmetries ( translation , spin @xmath67 , and time reversal ) intact .",
    "similarly , the point symmetry group at @xmath0 is reduced to @xmath68 .",
    "this would , in general , allow for additional four - fermion interactions and , as a consequence , more coupling constants .",
    "these possible interaction terms are @xmath69 these are the possible coupling constants before applying fierz identities , which are @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 range over all matrices of the form @xmath73 , and @xmath47 acts in the valley subspace , @xmath18 in the layer subspace , and @xmath74 in the spin subspace .",
    "all fields in the above identity are at the same position and imaginary time .",
    "some of these interaction terms would be eliminated if we were to apply these identities .",
    "however , these coupling constants will always be zero in any realistic situation because they will not be generated under our rg transformation unless they start with non - zero values .",
    "they also do not generate , nor are generated by , the terms that are possible in the zero - field case via the above fierz identities .",
    "we may see this by noting that the additional terms only allowed in the non - zero - field case are all of the form , @xmath75 where @xmath76 , while those that appear in the zero - field case all have @xmath77 . for these reasons",
    ", we will not include these additional interaction terms in our analysis .",
    "this restriction to nine coupling constants , and no more , keeps our rg analysis reasonably tractable .    note",
    "that we also include a chemical - potential - like term proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this is a counterterm that is introduced in order to cancel out similar terms that are generated from the interaction terms .",
    "while this term must , strictly speaking , be present , we do not explicitly calculate this term for similar reasons as those discussed in the previous work@xcite , namely , that it would be cumbersome and unnecessary to do so .",

    "groups of matrices enclosed in parentheses can be `` rotated '' into one another by the symmetries of the system ; matrices separated by commas are `` rotated '' into each other by the point operations , while groups separated by semicolons are `` rotated '' into each other by translations .",
    "note that some of the operators that transform identically under the _ geometric _ symmetries of the system transform differently under time reversal , and thus belong to different representations of the full symmetry group of the system .",
    "also note that , even though @xmath68 has only one - dimensional irreducible representations , the point operations can `` rotate '' a given matrix in the @xmath83 set into another ; this is because they form a _",
    "reducible _ , two - dimensional , representation of @xmath68 .    as a result of the reduced symmetry of our problem compared to the zero - field case",
    ", we will change the notation for the coupling constants from what was used before@xcite .",

    "we employ a finite - temperature wilson momentum shell renormalization group procedure@xcite .",
    "to summarize , we integrate out electronic modes in thin shells in momentum space , and then rescale the momenta and temperature to restore the theory to its previous form , but with rescaled constants .",
    "this allows us to derive differential equations , which we will call flow equations , describing how these constants evolve as we integrate out electronic modes .",

    "the net effect of these tendencies is to cause the coupling constants to saturate at finite values as @xmath109 at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "however , at a certain temperature , the critical temperature @xmath110 , the coupling constants diverge as @xmath109 ; we associate this divergence with the appearance of an instability toward one or more symmetry - breaking orders . while the coupling constants themselves diverge",

    "this phase is also gapped .",
    "we mentioned earlier that the fixed ray that we would have approached in the case of an infinite - range repulsive interaction in the absence of an applied layer energy difference is no longer valid ; in this case , we instead approach the ray given by @xmath193 above .",
    "the system is thus still unstable to a nematic order .",
    "we now turn our attention to the leading instability ( or instabilities ) of the system with finite - range electron - electron interactions , as was done for the zero - field case in ref .  .",
    "once again , we will consider the coulomb interaction screened by the presence of conducting plates parallel to the sample . in this work , however , we will only consider the case of the graphene sample exactly halfway between two infinite conducting plates , as this corresponds to the only physical situation of the two considered in the zero - field work in which we can simultaneously realize a finite electric field and maintain the sample at half - filling .",
    "the form of the microscopic electron - electron interaction is @xmath194 here , @xmath195 is the overall strength of the interaction , while @xmath196 is the distance between the conducting plates and the sample , which sets the range of the interaction .",
    "we may determine the corresponding starting values of the coupling constants from eqs .",
    ". this interaction is , as is , infinite for two particles on the same site .",
    "we therefore set the interaction to a finite value of @xmath197 times the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the physical reason for doing this is that , in reality , two electrons at the same site can no longer be treated as points for the purpose of determining how strongly they interact due to the finite spread of their wave functions ; this finite spread results in a finite on - site interaction .",
    "the infinite interaction is simply an artifact of our model , and we regularize it by setting the interaction to a large value .    in our calculation , we determine the leading instability as a function of the interaction range , parameterized by @xmath196 , and the interaction strength , parameterized by the initial value of @xmath198 .",
    "we do this for four different values of the layer energy difference .",
    "the values of @xmath101 that we choose are @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 . in determining these maps of the leading instability ,",
    "we impose a lower cutoff on the critical temperature , @xmath203 , below which we consider the system to be in the symmetric phase ( i.e.  there are no instabilities ) . in this calculation",
    ", we set the trigonal warping velocity to zero ; doing so simplifies the calculations , and we do not expect this to change the overall qualitative picture that we obtain . while we would not expect any qualitative changes in the map even for the case with no electric field , we expect this statement to hold even more strongly when there is a field present due to the fact that the electric field opens up a gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "this is because the presence of this gap makes the effects of trigonal warping less `` visible '' in the physics of the system . in the absence of the field , it would change the density of states noticeably , switching from that of a parabolic band structure to that of a dirac cone band structure at low energies .",
    "when the field is applied , on the other hand , then no such distinct qualitative change can easily be seen .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasemaps ] . as in the case with no layer energy difference@xcite , we find that the system is unstable to an antiferromagnetic state for short interaction ranges , to a nematic state for long ranges , and to both for intermediate ranges . however , unlike in the zero - field case , the critical ranges change noticeably with the interaction strength .",
    "we also see that , below a certain interaction strength or above a certain interaction range , the system has no instabilities at all .",
    "the critical interaction strength ranges from @xmath204 for @xmath205 to @xmath206 for @xmath207 , implying a large change ( by a factor of @xmath208 ) in the critical interaction strength for an approximate factor of @xmath209 change in the layer energy difference .",
    "the interaction range at which the system goes from a pure antiferromagnetic instability to instabilities toward both the af and nematic states remains steady at around @xmath210 unless the interaction strength starts approaching the critical value .",
    "the other boundaries , namely those at which the antiferromagnetic and nematic instabilities disappear , on the other hand , vary much more as the interaction strength is changed .",
    "the interaction range at which the antiferromagnetic instability disappears for an interaction strength of @xmath211 ranges from @xmath212 for @xmath205 to @xmath213 for @xmath207 , while the range at which the nematic instability disappears for the same interaction strength varies from @xmath214 for @xmath205 to @xmath215 for @xmath207 .",
    "thus , the main quantitative effect of the applied electric field is a strong suppression of the tendency toward the instability since a much larger critical interaction is necessary to induce a particular instability in general .",
    "we have extended previous rg studies of the problem of interacting electrons in bilayer graphene at half filling and at finite temperature@xcite to include the effects of an applied electric field perpendicular to the sample .",
    "we consider both the problem of determining the possible leading instabilities that one can in principle obtain and that of mapping out the leading instability of the system for a coulomb interaction screened by the presence of two parallel infinite conducting plates as a function of the interaction strength and of the interaction range .",
    "we discover that parts of the `` target plane '' , a two - parameter family of fixed rays found in the zero - field case@xcite , are no longer valid fixed rays , but that the four isolated fixed rays found therein are still valid .",
    "in particular , we find that the layer - polarized instability completely disappears ; this is not surprising , as such an instability no longer breaks any symmetries of the system .",
    "however , a number of new stable fixed rays appear , and we are able to determine five of them .",
    "we then construct maps of the leading instability ( or instabilities ) of the system as a function of interaction strength and interaction range for a screened coulomb - like interaction , like that between two electrons situated equidistant from two parallel infinite conducting planes , for four values of the applied electric field , or , equivalently , of an applied layer energy difference .",
    "we also find that the instabilities of the system as a function of interaction strength and range follow the same general pattern as they did in the absence of an electric field@xcite .",
    "we see an antiferromagnetic instability for short - ranged interactions , a nematic instability for long - ranged interactions , and both instabilities for intermediate - ranged interactions . however , these instabilities disappear if the interaction range becomes too long or the interaction strength becomes too low .",
    "thus , the applied electric field in general suppresses instabilities toward antiferromagnetic ground states .",
    "our results imply that an applied electric field can induce a nematic instability in a purely antiferromagnetic sample , or eliminate any tendencies towards antiferromagnetism when tendencies toward both antiferromagnetic and nematic instabilities are present in the absence of a field . in the previous work at zero electric field ,",
    "one conclusion was that it was possible that , in some of the experiments , the system had both antiferromagnetic and nematic orders@xcite .",
    "we predict that , should this in fact be the case , then , as one applies an increasingly strong electric field , one should see the antiferromagnetic order disappear first , leaving behind only a nematic order , followed by the nematic order vanishing as well for even stronger electric fields .",
    "this may be seen by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : phasemaps ] .",
    "consider , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasemaps](a ) in particular , which is the leading instability map for the smallest layer energy difference considered , @xmath207 .",

    "[ fig : phasemaps](b ) , which shows the same map , but now for a larger layer energy difference , @xmath217for the same interaction range and interaction strength , the system is only unstable to a nematic phase . if one now increases the layer energy difference even further , then , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasemaps](d ) , for which @xmath205 , there are no instabilities at all for that interaction range and strength",
    ".    there are several mean field studies that have considered the effect of an electric field on the ground state of bilayer graphene .",
    "two of these@xcite conclude that the ground state should be a quantum anomalous hall state , in which the system has a non - zero hall conductivity , even in the absence of an applied magnetic field , while two others@xcite conclude that it should be antiferromagnetic .",
    "one other@xcite considers various `` ( layer ) pseudospin magnetic '' states . in all cases , the application of an electric field suppresses the predicted orders .",

    "the only overlap between our rg study and these mean field studies is the prediction of suppression of symmetry - breaking order with the application of a sufficiently strong electric field .",
    "note that most of these works do not consider the possibility of a nematic state , and one@xcite rules it out .",
    "all of these only consider the possibility of a single order parameter .",
    "it is possible that , if these works had allowed for a coexistence of a nematic state with the gap - opening states that they do consider , then they would have obtained a non - zero nematic order parameter as well . while this problem would be of interest , it is beyond the scope of this work",
    ".    the existence of an antiferromagnetic gap would be consistent with our prediction about short- and intermediate - ranged interactions theoretically and with the results obtained in some experiments@xcite . in these experiments",
    ", it is found that the observed gap decreases as an electric field is applied in either direction , then increases again as the field is further strengthened .",
    "this would be consistent with an antiferromagnetic order being suppressed by the application of an electric field , thus reducing the overall gap , followed by an increase in the gap entirely due to the action of the electric field .",
    "while our theoretical predictions only consider the leading instabilities of the system as we approach the critical temperature , we expect that the associated symmetry - breaking orders should persist even well below said temperature . in principle",
    ", one may see additional instabilities appear as we cool the system below the critical temperature at which instabilities first appear , but investigating this interesting possibility is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the fact that the cleanest bilayer systems report@xcite only a nematic instability is also consistent with our finding , this time for long - ranged interactions , but much more controlled experimental work as a function of an applied electric field will be necessary to verify our predictions in the future .",

    "<S> we develop a theory for quantum phases and quantum multicriticality in bilayer graphene in the presence of an explicit energy gap in the non - interacting spectrum by extending previous renormalization group ( rg ) analyses of electron - electron interactions in gapless bilayer graphene at finite temperature to include the effect of an electric field applied perpendicular to the sample , which produces an energy gap in the single - particle electron - hole dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the possible outcomes of the resulting rg equations , represented by `` fixed rays '' along which ratios of the coupling constants remain constant and map out the leading instabilities of the system for an interaction of the form of a coulomb interaction that is screened by two parallel conducting plates placed equidistant from the electron . </S>",
    "<S> we find that some of the fixed rays on the `` target plane '' found in the zero - field case are no longer valid fixed rays , but that all four of the isolated rays are still valid . </S>",
    "<S> we also find five additional fixed rays that are not present in the zero - field case . </S>",
    "<S> we then construct maps of the leading instability ( or instabilities ) of the system for the screened coulomb - like interaction as a function of the overall interaction strength and interaction range for four values of the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pattern of leading instabilities is the same as that found in the zero - field case , namely , that the system is unstable to a layer antiferromagnetic state for short - ranged interactions , to a nematic state for long - ranged interactions , and to both for intermediate - ranged interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the interaction becomes too long - ranged or too weak , then the system will exhibit no instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the ranges at which the nematic instability first appears , the antiferromagnetic instability disappears , and the nematic instability disappears all decrease with increasing applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> our main qualitative finding , that the applied electric field opposes the emergence of symmetry - broken phases in general , suppressing , however , the antiferromagnetc phase more strongly compared with the nematic phase , is directly testable experimentally . </S>"
