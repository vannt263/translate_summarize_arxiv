    "i  zw  18  ( mkn 116 ) is a dwarf blue compact galaxy presently experiencing a strong burst of star formation which has produced a pair of bright hii regions .",
    "this galaxy has the smallest known abundance of heavy elements as derived from the ionized gaseous component .",
    "its oxygen abundance is only @xmath6 1/50 of that of the sun .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen derived from aperture synthesis observations have been discussed in several works .",
    "these works have derived hi masses in the range @xmath7@xmath8m@xmath9 and dynamical masses in the range @xmath7@xmath10m@xmath9 ( lequeux & viallefond 1980 ; viallefond et al .",
    "1987 ; van zee et al .",
    "van zee et al . (",
    "1998 ) have emphasized the complexity of the hi velocity fields , while martin ( 1996 ) and petrosian et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have discussed the ionized component .",
    "it has been suggested that objects with localized massive star formation surrounded by large hi envelopes might contain a significant reservoir of molecular hydrogen .",
    "such material could represent a significant fraction of the dark matter ( lequeux & viallefond 1980 ) .",
    "attempts to detect co in hii galaxies have so far been unsuccessful ( combes 1986 ; young et al . 1986 ; arnault et al . 1988 ; sage et al . 1992 ; isral et al . 1995 ; gondhalekar et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this lack of detection does not necessarily imply a lack of h@xmath0 : the co excitation could be lower than for molecular clouds in our galaxy or co might be more photodissociated than h@xmath0 ; but perhaps most importantly , c and o are highly underabundant in these metal deficient galaxies .",
    "the lack of detectable molecular material also has other important implications for galaxies like i  zw  18 . given the chemically unevolved nature of i  zw  18  and its lack of organized gas dynamics and/or spiral arms , it is unclear where and how this galaxy formed the molecular gas thought to be required to form the current generation of young stars",
    ".    therefore , we observed i  zw  18  with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ , moos et al .",
    "2000 ) with the aim of detecting cold molecular hydrogen lines in absorption against the stellar continuum of blue massive stellar clusters . in sect .  2 we describe the observations and the data analysis ,",
    "the results are discussed in sect .  3",
    "i  zw  18  has been observed for 31600 seconds on november 28 , 1999 with _ fuse _ through the two lif channels ( @xmath6 980 to 1187  ) .",
    "the large entrance aperture ( 30x 30 ) has been used , fully covering the galaxy .",
    "the data have been processed with the pipeline version 1.5 .",
    "the spectral resolution is defined by both the instrument and the size of the galaxy ( 10 ) .",
    "we find a resolution of about @xmath11 with a s / n ratio of @xmath12 per resolution element .",
    "many absorption lines are clearly detected .",
    "they correspond to three main components at different radial velocities : @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath15  km  s@xmath14 , and @xmath16  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "these can easily be identified respectively with the known high velocity cloud at @xmath17  km  s@xmath14 , the clouds within the galaxy expected at low radial velocity , and i  zw  18  itself with a redshift of @xmath18  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "we thus conclude that there is a systematic wavelength shift in the whole spectrum corresponding to a blueshift of about 100  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "this systematic wavelength shift can be explained by the preliminary wavelength calibration of _ fuse _ and by the position of the target possibly off the center of the slit .",
    "all the velocities quoted below refer to the observed velocities corrected by this systematic effect assumed to be exactly 100  km  s@xmath14 .    the high velocity cloud at @xmath17 km  s@xmath14  is detected in cii , crii , feii , and siii lines .",
    "the second component identified with galactic clouds shows absorption lines not only from atoms and ions ( e.g. , cii , oi , feii and siii ) but also from molecular hydrogen . lines from h@xmath0 at levels up to at least j=5 are detected .",
    "this is the only component showing the presence of these electronic transitions of h@xmath0 .",
    "this component shows a complex structure , suggesting the presence of several interstellar clouds separated by up to 20  km  s@xmath14 , and will not be detailed further .",
    "finally the third component detected at 750  km  s@xmath14  is seen in ari , ni , feii , and siii ( fig .",
    "[ atomic lines ] ) .",
    "in addition to these three main components , a complex structure is observed around 1032    and 1037    .",
    "this corresponds to the presence of ovi lines with radial velocities between @xmath15  km  s@xmath14  and @xmath19  km  s@xmath14  originating in the galactic halo .",
    "no line from h@xmath0 is observed at the radial velocity of i  zw  18  ( fig .",
    "[ plot h2 ] ) .",
    "we calculated the upper limits of the h@xmath0 column densities assuming an intrinsic width of the lines of @xmath20  km  s@xmath14  ( van zee et al .",
    "the limits have been estimated by calculating the difference between a simulated spectrum and the observed spectrum in 9 lyman bands ( 0 - 0 to 8 - 0 ) and calculating the corresponding increase of the @xmath21 of the fit to the spectrum .",
    "the upper limits quoted in table  [ h2 izw18 ] give an increase of the @xmath21 larger than 100 , corresponding to a non detection at the @xmath22  level .",
    "these limits are thus very conservative and correspond to a total column density @xmath23  @xmath2",
    ". a different intrinsic width of the lines would not change the result significantly .",
    "the hi lyman @xmath24 line is strongly perturbed by the airglow lines .",
    "however using only the blue wing of the absorption line and assuming that this wing is due to the hi of i  zw  18  at 750  km  s@xmath14 , it is possible to obtain an estimate of the hi column density .",
    "we find n(hi)@xmath25@xmath2 .",
    "this value is consistent with n(hi)@xmath26@xmath2 obtained with hst with a narrow slit ( kunth et al .",
    "1994 ) and the peak column density of @xmath27@xmath2 obtained with observations of the 21  cm emission line . assuming a constant n(h@xmath0)/n(hi ) ratio across the whole galaxy , we can scale the upper limit on h@xmath0 column density to a limit for the total mass of diffuse h@xmath0 , yielding @xmath28m@xmath9 .",
    "other lines of atoms and ions are observed in the i  zw  18  system at 750  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "for instance , lines of ari , ni , feii , and siii are clearly detected .",
    "neither ovi , nor the electronic transitions of co are detected at the i  zw  18  radial velocity .",
    "the lack of co absorption lines is not surprising since , contrary to diffuse h@xmath0 , co should be confined in very dense clouds opaque to uv sources .",
    "the problem of ovi will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the interpretation of the lack of absorption lines of h@xmath0 in the spectrum of i  zw  18  deserves a detailed discussion .",
    "note first that _ fuse _ gives access to the average absorption over the full body of i  zw  18 , providing @xmath29  lines of sight to stars emitting in the far  uv and gathered in a central region approximately @xmath30 wide . some of these stars are resolved by the hst ( dufour et al .",
    "our observations are not sensitive to dense molecular clouds since : i ) dust , even in minute amounts will hide the background stars in the far  uv .",
    "ii ) even if such clouds were transparent to uv photons , h@xmath0 absorption lines would not be detected at our s / n ratio unless the covering fraction is larger than @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , our observations are very sensitive to diffuse h@xmath0 .",
    "its absence is very unusual . indeed in our galaxy",
    ", h@xmath0 is strongly detected for hi column densities larger than a few @xmath32  @xmath2 , and is often detected for lower n(hi ) ( dixon et al .",
    "1998 ) . with 2n(h@xmath0)/n(hi)@xmath5 and hi column density as high as n(hi)@xmath4@xmath2",
    ", our observation is placed in the extreme bottom right corner of fig .",
    "5 of dixon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) representing the fraction of molecular hydrogen versus n(hi ) .",
    "such an extreme situation has never been observed within a galaxy .",
    "even the magellanic clouds , with sub - solar metallicities and high far  uv radiation fields , show detectable h@xmath0 along sightlines with lower hi column densities ( e.g. , friedman et al . 2000 , shull et al .",
    "we also would like to stress that this result raises an interesting similarity with what is observed in the damped ly@xmath33 systems in qso lines of sight at higher redshift . despite their high levels of hi , having low metalicity , low dust content and high uv environment",
    ", they also present no detectable h@xmath0 ( black et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "we now show that the lack of h@xmath0 in the diffuse ism of i  zw  18is a consequence of the low abundance of grains , of the high ultraviolet flux and of the low atomic density in the hi cloud surrounding i  zw  18 .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms for the formation of h@xmath0 in the hi cloud : formation via h@xmath34 ( see e.g. jenkins & peimbert 1997 ) , or combination of two h atoms on a dust grain ( hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ) .",
    "a third mechanism involving the production of h@xmath35 by radiative association of h and h@xmath36 is very inefficient in the present case since the reaction is slow and will not be considered further .",
    "the first mechanism for h@xmath0 formation starts with the formation of a negative ion , @xmath37 with a rate @xmath38 @xmath39 exp@xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath14 , @xmath39 being the temperature in units of 10@xmath42 k ( jenkins & peimbert 1997 ) .",
    "this is followed by the faster associative detachment reaction h@xmath34 + h @xmath43 h@xmath0 + @xmath44 .",
    "the electrons come mainly from the photoionization of carbon : @xmath45(c / h)@xmath46(h ) .",
    "we assume that the abundance of carbon in the hi cloud is the same as in the hii region : c / h = @xmath47 ( garnett et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the rate of formation is then as low as @xmath48  @xmath41s@xmath14 at a temperature of 10@xmath49 k , the most favorable case , so that the mechanism is very inefficient unless the medium contains clumps with very high densities .",
    "the formation of h2 on grains is a more efficient mechanism if the dust is cold enough for the h atoms to stick and remain on the grain surface long enough to combine . to estimate the grain temperature , we examine what happens at the edge of the hi cloud of i  zw  18 , where the uv flux which photodissociates h@xmath0 is minimal .",
    "the angular radius of the hi cloud is approximately 30  from the vla map of van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , corresponding to a radius @xmath50 = 1.7 kpc at the distance of i  zw  18 , taken as 11.5 mpc from its radial velocity of 750 km s@xmath14 ( @xmath51  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 ) .",
    "the radiation flux from the ionizing stars of i  zw  18  around 1000     measured by _ fuse _ or extrapolated from iue observations is about @xmath52  erg s@xmath14 @xmath2  @xmath14 . correcting for the galactic extinction ( @xmath53 mag .",
    ", kunth et al . 1994 ) , we obtain a uv flux at the earth of approximately @xmath54  erg s@xmath14 @xmath2  @xmath14 .",
    "this yields at @xmath50 a flux @xmath55 erg s@xmath14 @xmath2 @xmath14 .",
    "we finally find the grain temperature at @xmath50 by solving the temperature equilibrium equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the radius of the grain assumed to be spherical , @xmath58 its absorption efficiency , @xmath59 the incoming uv flux and @xmath60 the planck function at the temperature t of the grain . as any kind of grain is strongly absorbing in the far - uv which dominates strongly the radiation field , we take @xmath61 in the left side of the equation . in the far - ir where the grains emit ,",
    "we take @xmath62 ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "it is then possible to solve the temperature equation analytically , finding at @xmath63 @xmath64 this grain temperature is close to that in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium and allows the formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "however @xmath65 increases as @xmath66 closer to i  zw  18  and h@xmath0 can not form on grains in the inner parts of the hi cloud .    in the steady state , the molecular hydrogen is also destroyed through absorption in the lyman bands , and the resulting h@xmath0 column density can be estimated .",
    "we can take for the formation rate on grains @xmath67 the canonical galactic value of @xmath68  @xmath41  s@xmath14 ( hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ) divided by 50 since the dust - to - gas ratio is less than 1/50 of the galactic value ( kunth et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the present case where the h@xmath0 electronic bands are optically thin the fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath69 $ ] is ( jura 1974 )      where @xmath71 is a photodissociation rate .",
    "jura ( 1974 ) has calculated @xmath71 for different cases and we simply use his estimate close to the o9.5v star @xmath72 oph , scaled to @xmath73 , the flux at 1000    at the radius @xmath50 of i  zw  18 .",
    "we will assume that the cloud is spherical and uniform , in which case its density is @xmath74 = 0.4 atom @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the column density we measure in front of i  zw  18 .",
    "we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath0 is still smaller closer to i  zw  18  since the uv flux is accordingly larger .",
    "thus the calculated column density of h@xmath0 is        we thus conclude that our observation shows that the diffuse ism surrounding i  zw  18  can not be very inhomogeneous at large scales , otherwise h@xmath0 would have been observed .",
    "however it can not be excluded that this medium contains molecular clouds and in particular the kind of very dense , discrete molecular clumps proposed by pfenniger et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to account for the dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "these clumps would escape detection since the associated absorption would be observed only in front of stars which , although very numerous , have a very small total surface coverage .",
    "however the suggestion of lequeux & viallefond ( 1980 ) that the dark matter seen dynamically in i  zw  18  is made of widespread diffuse molecular hydrogen is no longer tenable after the present observations .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "financial support to u.s .",
    "participants has been provided by nasa contract nas5 - 32985 .",
    "we thank e. roueff for providing h@xmath0 transition data in electronic format ."
