    "traditional galaxy surveys trace large - scale structures visible through stellar light or radio emission of cold neutral gas . stars and known gaseous components",
    "account for roughly 12% of all baryons in the local universe and the rest are thought to reside in ionized gaseous halos around galaxies or in intergalactic space ( e.g.fukugita 2004 ) . in principle , the diffuse halo gas and intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be probed by the forest of absorption line systems observed in the spectra of background qsos .",
    "studies of qso absorption - line systems are therefore expected to provide important constraints for theoretical models that characterize the growth of large scale structures .",
    "indeed , the  forest is found to account for @xmath12% of the total baryons at redshift @xmath13 ( e.g.  rauch @xmath14  1997 ) . in the nearby universe ,",
    "penton , stocke , & shull ( 2002 , 2004 ) have argued that  absorbers of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath15  may contain between @xmath16% of the total baryons based on a simple assumption for the cloud geometry .",
    "various numerical simulations have further suggested that approximately 40% of the total baryons reside in diffuse intergalactic gas of temperature @xmath17 k ( e.g.  dav @xmath14  2001 ; cen & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "this temperature range makes high - ionization transitions , such as ovi@xmath181031,1037 and neviii@xmath18770 , 780 , ideal tracers of this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( see e.g.  verner @xmath14  1994 ; mulchaey @xmath141996 ; tripp @xmath14  2000 ) . however , recent studies have shown that roughly 50% of ovi absorbers are better explained by photo - ionized gas of cooler temperatures ( e.g.  tripp @xmath14  2008 ; thom & chen 2008a , b ) . therefore , the nature of these high - ionization systems does not appear to be unique .",
    "whether or not qso absorption - line systems trace the typical galaxy population bears directly on the efforts to locate the missing baryons in the present - day universe ( persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) , and to apply known statistical properties of the absorbers for constraining statistical properties of faint galaxies .",
    "this issue remains , however , unsettled ( lanzetta @xmath14  1995 ; stocke @xmath14  1995 ; chen @xmath14  1998 , 2001a ; penton @xmath14  2002 ; churchill @xmath14  2007 ) .",
    "while nearly all galaxies within a projected physical distance of @xmath19 kpc from a background qso have associated absorbers produced by civ@xmath181548,1550 and mgii@xmath182796,2803 ( chen @xmath14  2001b ; chen & tinker 2008 ) and nearly all galaxies within @xmath20 kpc have associated  absorbers of @xmath21  ( chen @xmath141998 , 2001a ) , not all  absorbers have a galaxy found within 1 @xmath22 mpc physical distance to a luminosity limit of @xmath23 ( morris @xmath14  1993 ; tripp @xmath14  1998 ; stocke @xmath14  2006 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether these absorbers are associated with fainter galaxies or not related to galaxies at all .",
    "in addition , the origin of ovi absorbers in terms of their galactic environment is also poorly quantified . while stocke @xmath14  ( 2006 ) found 95% of ovi absorbers at @xmath24",
    "are located at @xmath25 kpc from an @xmath26 galaxy , only three of the six ovi absorbers studied in prochaska @xmath14  ( 2006 ) have an @xmath26 galaxy found at @xmath27 mpc .    to understand the origin of qso absorption - line systems , chen @xmath14(2005 ) presented a pilot study of the galaxy  absorber cross - correlation function based on the  absorbers and galaxies identified along a single sightline toward pks0405@xmath0123 .",
    "the two - point cross - correlation analysis provides a quantitative measure of the origin of the absorbers based on their clustering amplitude .",
    "more massive systems arise in relatively higher overdensity environments and are expected to exhibit stronger clustering amplitude than low - mass objects arising in lower - overdensity environments .",
    "a primary result of chen @xmath14  ( 2005 ) was that the cross - correlation function @xmath28 including only emission - line dominated galaxies and strong  absorbers of @xmath4 showed a comparable strength to the galaxy auto - correlation function @xmath29 on co - moving , projection distance scales @xmath30 mpc , while there remained a lack of cross - correlation signal when using only absorption - line dominated galaxies .",
    "absorption - line dominated galaxies have red colers and are presumably evolved early - type galaxies , while emission - line dominated galaxies are blue and presumably younger star - forming systems .",
    "early - type galaxies are found to cluster more strongly than younger , star - formig galaxies ( e.g.  madgwick @xmath14  2003 ; zehavi @xmath14  2005 ) , and are therefore expected to reside in regions of higher matter overdensity .",
    "the comparable correlation amplitudes of emission - line galaxies and strong  absorbers therefore suggested that strong absorbers of @xmath4 reside in the same overdensity regions as emission - line dominated galaxies .",
    "it appeared that these absorbers do not trace regions where more massive galaxies with dominant absorption spectral features reside .",
    "this result of chen @xmath14  ( 2005 ) provided the first quantitative constraint on the origin of  absorbers in terms of the significance of the underlying matter density fluctuations around the regions where they reside .",
    "it also offered a physical explanation for the on - average weaker clustering amplitude of  absorbers relative to the clustering amplitude of the luminous galaxy population reported earlier ( e.g.  morris @xmath14  1993 ) .",
    "wilman @xmath14  ( 2007 ) performed a similar analysis based on a galaxy and  absorber pair sample established over 16 qso sightlines . while these authors concluded that a spectral - type dependent galaxy and  cross - correlation function",
    "was not confirmed by their analysis , the two - dimensional cross - correlation function presented in figure 4 of wilman @xmath14clearly displays a strong signal between  absorbers and emission - line galaxies that is absent in the cross - correlation function measured using only absorption - line galaxies .    to examine whether the initial results of chen @xmath14  ( 2005 ) obtained based on a single field are representative of the general  absorber population , we have been conducting a deep , wide - area survey of galaxies in fields around qsos at @xmath31 .",
    "the qso fields are selected to have ultraviolet echelle spectra available from the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the high - resolution uv spectra are necessary for finding intervening hydrogen  and  absorbers to form a statistically representative sample ( see e.g.  thom & chen 2008a ; tripp @xmath14  2008 ) , as well as identifying their associated metal - line transitions for constraining the ionization state of the gas .",
    "the galaxy sample from our survey program therefore also allows us to expand upon the initial  absorber study to understanding the galactic environment of ionized gas traced by the ovi absorbers .",
    "the primary objectives of our galaxy survey program are ( i ) to examine the physical origin of  and  absorbers based on their respective clustering amplitudes , and ( ii ) to constrain the properties of extended gas around galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the design of our galaxy survey program . in section 3 , we describe our observing program that includes both imaging observations , the selection of candidate galaxies , and multi - slit spectroscopic observations of three qso fields . in section 4 , we summarize the results of the spectroscopic survey and examine the survey completeness . in section 5 , we summarize the properties of known absorption - line systems along individual qso sightlines and present a new  absorber catalog for the sightline toward pg1216@xmath1069 . descriptions of individual fields are presented in section 6 .",
    "results of a galaxy  absorber cross - correlation study are presented in section 7 , and their implications are discussed in section 8 .",
    "finally , we summary the main results of the paper in section 9 . we adopt a @xmath32cdm cosmology , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath35 throughout the paper .",
    "the primary objectives of our galaxy survey program are ( i ) to examine the physical origin of  and  absorbers based on their clustering amplitudes , and ( ii ) to constrain the properties of extended gas around galaxies . to reach the goals , we have been conducting a wide - area survey of galaxies in fields around qsos at @xmath36 , for which echelle spectra at ultraviolet wavelengths are available from fuse and hst / stis .",

    "these luminous galaxies are thought to reside at the peaks of the underlying dark matter density fluctuations with a small fraction ( @xmath39% ) arising in group / cluster environments ( zheng @xmath14  2007 ) .",
    "therefore , they offer a unique tracer of the large - scale matter overdensity in the distant universe . under the @xmath32cdm paradigm , the relative clustering amplitudes of qso absorption - line systems with respect to these galaxies",
    "provide quantitative measures of the overdensities of the regions where the absorbers reside ( mo & white 2002 ; tinker @xmath14  2005 ) .    to examine the properties of extended gas around galaxies , we aim to establish a complete sample of sub-@xmath26 galaxies at @xmath38 within a projected co - moving distance of @xmath40 kpc of the qso lines of sight",

    "taking into account previous findings of chen @xmath14  ( 1998 ; 2001a ) , we conclude that emission - line dominated galaxies are surrounded by extended gas of nearly unity covering fraction and that strong  absorbers primarily probe extended gaseous halos around young star - forming galaxies .",
    "second , these strong  absorbers exhibit on average @xmath5 times weaker amplitude with the absorption - line dominated galaxies ( solid points with solid errorbars panel d ) at all separations of @xmath6 mpc .",
    "the weaker clustering amplitude between strong  absorbers and absorption - line dominated galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the clustering amplitude of mgii absorbers and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) found by gauthier @xmath14(2009 ) using a flux - limited lrg sample .",
    "it suggests that the incidence of strong  absorbers is very low around these absorption - line dominated galaxies .",
    "third , weak  absorbers of @xmath7 exhibit only a weak clustering signal to galaxies of all type at separations @xmath965 mpc ( solid points with dotted errorbars in figure 13 ) .",
    "the weak clustering amplitude indicates that the majority of these weak absorbers do not share the same dark matter halos as the galaxies .",
    "this result extends the finding of grogin & geller ( 1998 ) to @xmath966 galaxies that weak  absorbers of @xmath7 occur far more frequently in underdense regions in comparison to these dwarf galaxies .",
    "clustering amplitudes measured at large separations of @xmath967 mpc are necessary to constrain the mean overdensities where these weak  absorbers reside .",
    "finally ,  absorbers exhibit similar clustering amplitudes as strong  absorbers .",
    "specifically , they show a comparable clustering amplitude ( crosses in panel c of figure 13 ) with emission - line galaxies on scales of @xmath968 mpc but a factor of @xmath5 times lower ( petagon points in panel d of figure 13 ) than absorption - line dominated galaxies . despite large uncertainties , the differential clustering amplitudes suggest a direct association between  absorbers and star - forming galaxies and a lack of physical connections between the majority of  absorbers and the gaseous halos around these massive , early - type galaxies .",
    "we have also attempted to investigate possible dependence of the cross - correlation amplitude on the strength of ovi absorbers using a mark two - point correlation statistic ( see e.g.  sheth et al .",
    "2005 ) . applying the absorber column density as a mark",
    ", we could not distinguish whether such dependence is present .",
    "it appears that the sample size is still too small for such study to yield statistically significant results .",
    "nevertherless , the comparable clustering amplitude among emission - line galaxies , strong  absorbers , and  absorbers is , however , difficult to interpret , because the number density of  absorbers is found to be @xmath969 per unit redshift interval per line of sight ( e.g.  tripp @xmath14  2008 ; thom & chen 2008a ) and the number density of strong  absorbers is found to be @xmath970 ( weymann @xmath14  1998 ; dobrzycki @xmath14  2002 ) .",

    "available high - resolution hst / wfpc2 images of five absorbing galaxies show that these galaxies exhibit disk - like morphology with mildly disturbed features on the edge , suggesting that tidal disruption may be in effect .",

    "<S> we present an imaging and spectroscopic survey of galaxies in fields around qsos he0226@xmath04110 , pks0405@xmath0123 , and pg1216@xmath1069 . </S>",

    "<S> hst / wfpc2 images of the fields around pks0405@xmath0123 and pg1216@xmath1069 are available for studying the optical morphologies of absorbing galaxies . combining the absorber and galaxy data , we perform a cross - correlation study to understand the physical origin of  and  absorbers and to constrain the properties of extended gas around galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our study are ( 1 ) both strong  absorbers of @xmath4 and  absorbers exhibit a comparable clustering amplitude as emission - line dominated galaxies and a factor of @xmath5 weaker amplitude than absorption - line dominated galaxies on co - moving projected distance scales of @xmath6 mpc ; ( 2 ) weak  absorbers of @xmath7 appear to cluster very weakly around galaxies ; ( 3 ) none of the absorption - line dominated galaxies at @xmath8 kpc has a corresponding absorber to a sensitive upper limit of @xmath9  , while the covering fraction of  absorbing gas around emission - line dominated galaxies is found to be @xmath10% ; and ( 4 ) high - resolution images of five  absorbing galaxies show that these galaxies exhibit disk - like morphologies with mildly disturbed features on the edge . together , the data indicate that absorbers arise preferentially in gas - rich galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , tidal debris in groups / galaxy pairs may be principally responsible for the observed  absorbers , particularly those of @xmath11 m . </S>"
