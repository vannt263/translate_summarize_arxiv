    "raman scattering from molecules in proximity to a rough noble - metal surface or near a metal nanoparticle is strongly enhanced due to the interaction with surface plasmon modes and to the formation of metal  molecular complexes .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon , which allows for the measurement of raman spectra of extremely low concentrations of molecules @xcite with a single - molecule detection as its ultimate limit , @xcite is very attractive for sensor applications . in particular",
    ", it could be utilized for detection and identification of hazardous materials @xcite or for probing of biological structures , @xcite for which raman fingerprints provide unique information about molecular composition .",
    "recent achievements in the design of nanostructured materials demonstrate substantial progress toward resolving the long - standing problem of low reproducibility of sers substrates .",
    "arrays of nanoantennas fabricated with electron beam lithography @xcite or nanoimprinting @xcite utilize extended control of optically excited surface plasmons to tune the plasmon resonance frequency and to focus the near field in particular areas .",
    "lithographically engineered @xcite or laser - engineered @xcite structures allow the observation of a spatially homogeneous enhancement of the raman signal by 7 orders of magnitude @xcite when an excitation laser frequency far below intramolecular resonances is employed . however , there remains a number of open questions which are related to the formation of hot spots and to the homogeneity of the raman response throughout a sample . the enormous raman cross section reported for fluorescent dyes in hot spots",
    "@xcite has a substantial contribution from an intramolecular resonant excitation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , many important analytes do not have electronic excitations in the available range of laser frequencies . for these systems , a relevant question is whether modification of the local environment of the molecule can be used to boost the limit of raman detection sensitivity .",
    "the importance of the so - called chemical enhancement @xcite has been debated since the early years after the discovery of sers .",
    "the contributions of the electromagnetic coupling and the chemical binding are not clearly separable in the experiments , @xcite because the first process is essential for sers detection .",
    "this adds to ambiguity in the interpretation of sers experiments .",
    "moreover , the electronic coupling effects are sensitive to the local environment of adsorbed molecules , which makes a systematic analysis of chemical effects more difficult .",
    "general theories of chemical enhancement @xcite provide an intuitive picture of the mechanism , but rely on phenomenological parameters . in this context ,",
    "first - principles modeling @xcite is a useful tool that complements experimental studies and provides additional information about microscopic properties of a metal surface / adsorbed molecule interface .",
    "complete modeling of a molecule chemisorbed on a rough metal surface requires multi - scale simulations , in which the electronic structure of a molecule and its local environment are treated by quantum chemical methods while a larger - scale environment is accounted for by a mean - field approximation .",
    "however , to understand the chemical bonding effects in sers , it is enough to simulate only the local environment of a molecule .",
    "this is consistent with the `` adatom model '' , @xcite which assumes that the atomic - scale roughness features determine the hot spots on a metal surface .",
    "obviously , such an approach does not account for the electromagnetic enhancement due to the excitation of surface plasmons in the metal .",
    "an interference between the chemical and the electromagnetic effects is ignored as well . to get the total enhancement factor one has to use a conventional phenomenological relation @xcite which assumes that both effects enter in multiplicative fashion . in most previous theoretical studies of sers ,",
    "only a few metal atoms were used to model the molecule / surface interaction .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered a complex with a single ag atom to mimic a chemisorption of phthalimide on a silver surface and obtained a reasonable agreement with experiments .",
    "recently , schatz and co - workers reported a resonance raman response calculation procedure using phenomenological lifetime parameters for electronic polarizability derivatives .",
    "@xcite this procedure has been applied to study sers of pyridine adsorbed on silver clusters up to a few tens of atoms .",
    "@xcite the authors identified three different mechanisms contributing to sers : change in static polarizability of the molecule upon adsorption , resonant enhancement due to charge  transfer transitions , and electromagnetic enhancement due to coupling with a strong excitation in a metal cluster , and discussed their role in sers . in ref .",
    "@xcite some examples of different molecules and pyridine with substituents have been considered .",
    "however , no systematic studies of other molecular structures have been done yet .",
    "given the differences in the chemical bonding of pyridine and thiols to metal surfaces , it is important to know how general these findings are and whether they can be applied to other types of metal  molecular coupling or to other molecules .    in this paper , we address effects related to chemical bonding on raman scattering from benzenethiol adsorbed on silver clusters ag@xmath2 , @xmath3 , which is one of the most commonly used analytes in sers experiments .",
    "we link the enhancement of raman response to the modification of the molecular electronic structure due to adsorption .",
    "excitation energies and transition moments of the metal ",
    "molecular complexes are substantially different from those of bare metal clusters and of isolated benzenethiol . for off - resonant excitations ,",
    "raman response is enhanced by one order of magnitude . to understand the importance of the cluster geometry",
    ", we modeled a pool of 7 different metal  molecular complexes .",
    "we identify the effects that contribute to the off - resonant raman enhancement , such as the _ molecular orientational effect _",
    ", the effect of the _ local symmetry _ of the adsorbate , and the effect of the _ proximity _ of the vibrational mode to a binding site .",
    "stochastic modulation of these effects by thermal motion is related to `` blinking '' events observed in recent sers experiments on 4-aminobenzenethiol .",
    "@xcite we compare the computed vibrational frequency shifts and relative raman scattering cross sections of the the metal  molecular complexes to experimental sers data for benzenethiol adsorbed on silver surfaces .",
    "@xcite    our theoretical approach to compute raman scattering cross section is based on analytical derivatives of frequency - dependent polarizabilities .",
    "@xcite the frequency dependence of polarizability derivatives includes resonance enhancement effects in an approximate fashion , which allows us to describe both off - resonance and resonance enhancement effects on an equal footing and to study resonance excitation profiles of raman scattering cross sections .",
    "however , this approach does not take into account the finite lifetime of the excited states . as a result ,",
    "the raman scattering cross sections computed within our approach diverge in the strictly resonant case .",
    "we demonstrate that formation of mixed metal ",
    "molecular electronic states results in a resonance structure in the raman excitation profiles ( reps ) for molecular vibrations within the excitation range @xmath1  ev , which is far below the purely intramolecular transitions .",
    "our lower - bound estimates of the raman signal enhancement due to chemical bonding is of the order of @xmath4 in the absence of intramolecular resonances .",
    "the chemical bonding effect thus provides additional flexibility in controlling the enhancement of raman scattering from chemisorbed species .",

    "@xcite triple-@xmath5 valence - polarization basis sets ( def2-tzvp @xcite ) were used for the main group elements while for silver atoms we employed split - valence basis sets with polarization ( def2-sv(p ) @xcite ) and effective core potentials ( ecp ) comprising the 28 core electrons and accounting for scalar relativistic effects .",
