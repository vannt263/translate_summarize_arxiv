    "in many heavy fermions systems ( hfs ) a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) separates a non - magnetic from a magnetic ground state at @xmath8 k. such a transition is governed by the competition between kondo screening of localized moments and rkky - like intersite interactions .",
    "it can be tuned by applying an external pressure , a magnetic field or by chemical substitution . in the vicinity of a qpt ,",
    "the critical fluctuations have a quantum feature characterized by an effective dimension @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the spatial dimension and @xmath11 the dynamical exponent@xcite .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath11 is related to the imaginary time direction ( @xmath12 for antiferromagnetic fluctuations ) .",
    "when @xmath13 is increased , a cross - over regime ( also called quantum classical ( qc ) ) sets up when the fluctuations lose their quantum features and become controlled by @xmath13 .",
    "the dimension is then reduced from @xmath14 to @xmath10 . in a simple picture",
    "this can be seen as a finite - size scaling @xcite , where the `` finite size '' @xmath15 of the system in the time dimension is decreased when @xmath13 is increased @xcite : the time dimension is then progressively suppressed .",
    "if @xmath16 is the relaxation time of quantum fluctuations , the quantum regime is the low @xmath13 regime for which @xmath17 , where the dynamical properties behave as functions of @xmath18 and do not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "the cross - over regime is then expected for @xmath19 , its dynamical properties behaving as functions of @xmath20 .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is a unique tool for studying dynamic magnetic properties .",
    "enhancements of spin fluctuations ( sf ) have already been reported by ins around the qpt of hfs ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13-dependence of those low - energy excitations is believed to be related to the low - temperature non fermi liquid behavior observed by bulk measurements near the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of such systems @xcite .",
    "that is why it is necessary for the understanding of qpt to study precisely how sf evolve with @xmath13 and to search for scaling laws specific to the qc regime .",
    "several ins studies report @xmath20 scaling of the dynamical spin susceptibility in hfs or high @xmath21 superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , some insight was given by the detailed study of schrder et al .",
    "at the qcp of cecu@xmath22au@xmath23 @xcite : they obtained a collapse of the dynamical spin susceptibility on a single curve when plotted as @xmath24 .",
    "a general form of this law was found to work with the same @xmath13-exponents for each vector of the reciprocal lattice and down to the smallest accessible temperatures .",
    "this @xmath3-dependence became the starting point of a local description of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "such a description is opposed to itinerant scenarii where the qpt is only driven by fluctuations at some critical wavevectors @xcite .",

    "large single crystals are available , which makes it possible to investigate precisely the reciprocal space via ins . in this system , the observed excitation spectra consist in short range magnetic correlations enhanced at the wavevectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , while uncorrelated sf are obtained away from these wavevectors and cover most of the brillouin zone ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed survey of the sf repartition in the reciprocal space of this system ) .",
    "previous neutron measurements have shown the continuous behavior of the sf through the qcp @xcite and several tests led to a rather good accordance between moriya s itinerant theory and experimental data @xcite .",
    "ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 constitutes consequently an opportunity to study quantum criticality in a case for which the itineracy of the @xmath37 electrons is established . for this purpose , we present here new measurements at the critical concentration @xmath38 that were made not only to benefit from much better statistics but also to measure a broader range of temperatures ( between 40 mk and 294 k ) and energies ( between 0.1 and 9.5 mev ) .",
    "such extended data are required for a precise determination of the temperature dependence of the sf . in this paper",
    "we report an anomalous scaling behavior of the dynamical spin susceptibility at the qcp of ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 : instead of @xmath20 , @xmath39 scalings with @xmath7 are obtained .",
    "contrary to the other cases reported in literature , the laws found here depend on the wavevector , and each wavevector is characterized by a different low - temperature cut - off below which a nearly @xmath13-independent quantum regime is obtained .",

    "were added to eliminate higher - order contaminations . in both cases",
    "pg was used for the vertically focusing monochromator and for the horizontally focusing analyzer .",
    "the final neutron energy was fixed to 4.65 mev on in12 and to 14.7 mev on in22 with the resulting energy resolutions of about 0.17 mev on in12 and 1 mev on in22 ( fwhm of the incoherent signal ) . for temperatures between 2.5 and 80",
    "k the high - energy points obtained on in22 were combined with the ones obtained on in12 , with an appropriate scale factor chosen for the collapse of the data in their common range 1.9 - 2.5 mev .",
    "a complementary neutron experiment was carried out on the inverted - geometry time - of - flight spectrometer iris at isis ( didcot , u.k . ) using a fixed final neutron energy of 1.84 mev ( pg analyzer ) resulting in 18 @xmath45ev resolution fwhm .",
    "the susceptibility measurements were performed both in a commercial squid dc magnetometer for temperatures between 5 and 300 k and in a dilution refrigerator squid dc magnetometer for temperatures between 250 mk and 5 k , with the magnetic field along the @xmath46 $ ] easy axis in both cases .",
    "the data presented here consist in energy scans obtained by ins at two wavevectors : the antiferromagnetic momentum transfer @xmath47 = ( 0.69 1 0 ) = @xmath48 - @xmath34 , where @xmath48 = ( 1 1 0 ) is a reciprocal lattice vector , and the wavevector @xmath49 = ( 0.44 1 0 ) , which is sufficiently far from @xmath34 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , so that no spatial correlations are observed . in fig . 1 the excitations spectra obtained at those two vectors are plotted for three representative temperatures : their shape is characteristic of a relaxation process . at @xmath52",
    "k , antiferromagnetic fluctuations are enhanced in comparison with the ones obtained at @xmath49 . when the temperature is raised",
    "the difference between the two signals is attenuated and above the correlation temperature @xmath53 80 k they are almost identical ; the system has lost its antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "we can also notice that the two signals are identical for @xmath54 mev at all temperatures .",
    "the observed intensity is proportional to the scattering function @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) , from which the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath4 is deduced using : @xmath57    for the two wavevectors the dynamical susceptibility is well fitted by a single quasi elastic lorentzian shape of the form @xcite : @xmath58 that corresponds to the simplest approximation that can be made to treat the spin fluctuations . the general form of the dynamical susceptibility is the fourier transform of a single exponential decay of relaxation rate @xmath59 .",
    "it can be expressed by : @xmath60 in such a case , the static susceptibility is given by the kramers - kronig relation : @xmath61    however , in a previous thermal ins experiment on ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 , adroja et al . observed a broad crystal field ( cf ) excitation at about 30 mev that dominates the excitation spectra for @xmath62 10 mev , its width ( hwhm ) being about 15 mev @xcite .",
    "bulk susceptibility measurements also indicate that the cf scheme do not change very much with concentration @xmath63 in ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider that in ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , as well as in ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 , the cf excitations dominate the low - energy sf for @xmath62 10 mev . instead of ( 4 ) it is finally better to approximate the static susceptibility of the low - energy sf by introducing an energy cut - off of 10 mev such as : @xmath64    @xmath55 and its fits using ( 2 )",
    "are plotted for the two wavevectors and 2.5 @xmath65 80 k in fig . 2 a and b. @xmath66 , which corresponds to antiferromagnetic sf ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 a : it is found to decrease in intensity and to broaden when @xmath13 is increased . for uncorrelated sf , the scattering intensity @xmath67 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "2 b , is characterized by the collapse of the data on a single curve for positive energy transfers and @xmath68 k. the negative energy points are strongly @xmath13-dependent because of the detailed balance condition @xmath69 .",
    "such a behavior was also reported for the polycrystalline compounds ucu@xmath70pd and cerh@xmath71pd@xmath2sb , where the scattering is temperature independent for positive energy transfers @xcite . for @xmath72 and 5",
    "k the uncorrelated signal @xmath67 moves to higher energies .",
    "although better fits are obtained using an inelastic symmetrized lorentzian instead of the quasielastic lorentzian shape ( 2 ) , it is difficult to conclude about their inelasticity , since the widths of these peaks are too important . for both @xmath47 and @xmath49 , a strong @xmath13-dependence of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath4 deduced from ( 1 ) ( and its fits using ( 2 ) )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 c and d. contrary to @xmath55 , @xmath4 has a decreasing intensity for both wavevectors and is strongly broadened when @xmath13 is raised .",
    "finally , for each spectrum , the relaxation rate @xmath59 and the static susceptibility @xmath73 are extracted using ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) . in the next two subsections ,",
    "the results of the fits of low - energy sf are separately analyzed for the momentum transfers @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "the analysis of the antiferromagnetic sf at the momentum transfer @xmath47 is only made below @xmath53 80 k. the variations with @xmath13 of the relaxation rate @xmath74 and the static susceptibility @xmath75 for antiferromagnetic sf are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . as seen , there are clearly two different regimes : a nearly @xmath13-independent low - temperature and a strongly @xmath13-dependent high - temperature regimes .    below a characteristic temperature of @xmath76",
    "k , @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the relaxation rate is found to have the value @xmath78 in this regime : this is thus the low - temperature regime for which @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath15 , as presented using a simple picture of scaling in the introduction .",
    "the saturation of antiferromagnetic sf corresponds thus to their quantum regime .",
    "because of the limited resolution on in12 and in22 , a complementary experiment was made on the time - of - flight backscattering spectrometer iris .",
    "measurements were carried out at 100 mk and 2 k with a resolution of 18 @xmath45ev .",

    "we will focus on the anomalous form of this scaling law obtained for the antiferromagnetic low - energy sf .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath89 and the static susceptibility @xmath90 of uncorrelated sf are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . as for the antiferromagnetic",
    "sf , we can define a characteristic temperature @xmath91 k at the intercept of the asymptotic low and high - temperature regimes .",

    ", @xmath13-power laws can be extracted ; the fits made on @xmath90 for @xmath95 k and on @xmath89 for @xmath96 k give : @xmath97 with @xmath98    however , higher energy scales and smaller intensities make the study of uncorrelated sf more difficult than for the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "indeed , the corresponding quantum regime differs from the antiferromagnetic one in its energy scale @xmath99 that is 5 times larger than the antiferromagnetic energy scale @xmath100 .",
    "then , the @xmath13-dependent regime must be analyzed at temperatures sufficiently higher than @xmath92 .",
    "for those temperatures , the ground state sf and the cf excitations are no more completely separate entities in the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "this affects the determination of @xmath101 and @xmath102 and makes their uncertainties larger than in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "part of the uncertainty is removed by introducing a cut - off when determining the susceptibility with ( 5 ) .",
    "this procedure is justified a posteriori by the recovery of a curie - like behavior of @xmath90 at high temperature in good agreement with the bulk susceptibility ( see section 4.1 ) . since the susceptibility @xmath90 estimated from ( 5 )",
    "is notably different from the one estimated with @xmath103 , a scaling plot for the uncorrelated fluctuations at @xmath49 , as done in fig .",
    "4 for @xmath47 , is not meaningful using the raw neutron data .",
    "however , the analysis of each individual spectrum that leads to ( 7 ) implies that @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the bulk susceptibility @xmath105 , measured along the @xmath106 axis , is compared in fig . 6 with the microscopic static susceptibilities",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath90 . for @xmath107 k , @xmath108 follows a curie - weiss law with a curie temperature @xmath109 k , i.e. @xmath110 . for @xmath107 k , the static susceptibilities @xmath73 deduced from ins have also been fitted by curie - like laws that are undistinguishable from curie - weiss laws , within the uncertainty in @xmath73 . from the cf scheme of ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite , it is known that the van vleck term is negligible in the bulk @xmath106-axis susceptibility @xcite . since the high - energy cf excitation is not taken into account in the integrated susceptibilities from ins , both macroscopic and microscopic susceptibilities @xmath108 and @xmath73 correspond only to low - energy sf .",
    "the bulk susceptibility being a measure at the wavevector @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 when @xmath73 is obtained using ( 5 ) . for @xmath113 , there are no more magnetic correlations and @xmath73 does not depend on @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus adequate to adjust @xmath73 to @xmath108 at high temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "6 .    as for @xmath75 and @xmath90",
    ", we can define for @xmath108 a characteristic temperature @xmath114 k at the intercept of the two asymptotic low and high - temperature regimes . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the fluctuations are spatially - correlated , and the hierarchy @xmath116 is obtained in the low temperature quantum regime .",
    "this means that low energy sf are slightly more important at @xmath117 0 than at @xmath49 , both being much smaller than the antiferromagnetic sf .",
    "the slight enhancement of the sf at @xmath117 0 is most likely due to weak ferromagnetic correlations and is linked to the metamagnetic transition of the system ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 : the application of a magnetic field induces an increase of ferromagnetic sf that are maximal at the metamagnetic field @xmath118 @xcite .    at low temperatures",
    ", we can also express @xmath75 and @xmath90 in cgs units , which gives : @xmath119 if @xmath5 is the characteristic temperature of the sf at the wavevector @xmath3 , we have thus @xmath120 independent of @xmath3 , within the error bars .",
    "since @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we can assume @xmath123 , so that the product @xmath124 is independent of @xmath3",
    ". hence , the low - temperature magnetic properties are in good agreement with a fermi liquid description of a correlated system governed by an antiferromagnetic instability , for which @xmath125 is expected to be constant @xcite .",
    "this fermi liquid picture is broken when , at high temperatures , @xmath125 drops because of the different @xmath13-behaviors of @xmath59 and @xmath126 .",
    "contrary to the simple picture of scaling presented in the introduction @xcite and also to the different cases of scaling reported in the literature @xcite , we obtain @xmath39 instead of @xmath20 scalings of the dynamical spin susceptibility of low - energy sf . we have showed that the low - energy sf of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 obey scaling laws that depend on the wavevector @xmath3 , each one being characterized by a different low - temperature cut - off @xmath5 , below which a @xmath13-independent fermi liquid - like quantum regime is obtained . while a local description of quantum criticality was proposed to explain the behavior of cecu@xmath22au@xmath23 @xcite , the itinerant character of our system is a key element to understand its behavior @xcite , and a scenario for which the qpt is driven by itinerant magnetism should be preferred .",
    "however , our system does not enter the framework of existing itinerant theories for qpt @xcite : two main discrepancies are obtained between theoretical and experimental features .",
    "a first disagreement comes from the saturation below a finite temperature @xmath127 3 k of @xmath77 : we do not observe any divergence of the dynamical spin susceptibility at the qpt of ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 and a low - temperature cut - off has to be taken into account .",
    "the saturation of antiferromagnetic sf at the qpt of this system was already reported for both cases of tuning by concentration or pressure @xcite .",
    "the origin of this cut - off is not yet well understood .",
    "it could be linked to the appearance of a tiny magnetic moment below @xmath128 k @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the dynamical spin susceptibility is in marked contrast with its expected divergence at a quantum critical point .",
    "the second discrepancy comes from that , in the qc regime , itinerant sf theories @xcite predict for 3d antiferromagnetic sf a @xmath130 scaling law with @xmath131 = 3/2 instead of our experimental @xmath132 = 0.8 ; more generally , a value of @xmath131 smaller than 1 can not be obtained in the theories of qpt @xcite . in sf theories",
    "@xcite , a mean - field picture is used to build a @xmath3-dependent dynamical susceptibility @xmath133 from a bare susceptibility @xmath134 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the exchange interaction . in ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 ,",
    "the correlated signal corresponds only to a small part of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "this fact together with the saturation of the corresponding signal imply that the correlated response has a small spectral weight ( of about 10 @xmath137 ) when integrating the dynamical spin susceptibility over the brillouin zone .",
    "the bare susceptibility can thus be approximated by the susceptibility measured at @xmath49 .",
    "the principle mechanism of relaxation of 4@xmath138 electrons contributing to the bare susceptibility is the kondo effect .",
    "the kondo temperature , @xmath139 , is then usually estimated by the low temperature neutron linewidth .",
    "this will lead here to @xmath140 k. this estimation of @xmath139 is in very good agreement with the values deduced from thermodynamic and thermoelectric power measurements @xcite and the approximation of considering the susceptibility at @xmath49 for the bare susceptibility is thus reasonable .",
    "in sf theories , the bare susceptibility is supposed to be weakly temperature dependent .",
    "this corresponds to a low temperature regime below the kondo temperature where the @xmath37 moments on cerium sites are screened by conduction electrons and where the renormalized fermi surface is fully formed . on the contrary",
    ", we experimentally found a scaling in a temperature range where the bare susceptibility has a strong temperature dependence .",
    "this is certainly the main reason why unexpected exponents are found .",
    "since antiferromagnetic sf saturate below @xmath141 k , a search for the @xmath142 3/2 scaling predicted by sf theories can consequently only be done in the range @xmath143 , which is experimentally very difficult to verify because of the closeness of @xmath82 and @xmath92 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic sf being built from the bare one , these two quantities are not independent .",
    "a theory including the temperature variation of the bare kondo susceptibility is thus needed to explain the anomalous scaling law we obtain for the susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath47 for @xmath144 .",
    "an impurity kondo model seems to be a good starting point to describe the bare susceptibility measured at @xmath49 , since it leads , for @xmath13 sufficiently higher than @xmath145 , to the curie - weiss static susceptibility and to the @xmath146-like behavior of the relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "indeed , we experimentally obtained at high temperature for the wavevector @xmath49 a curie susceptibility and a value of @xmath102 quite close to 0.5 .      in the present study , we have determined the energy and temperature dependence of the sf at the qcp of ce@xmath25la@xmath23ru@xmath2si@xmath2 .",

    "the first study , using a triple - axis spectrometer , established a scaling law of the form @xmath24 at an antiferromagnetic wavevector @xcite .",
    "however , the extension of this law to other parts of the reciprocal lattice was done using a time - of - flight spectrometer @xcite , which limits the information that can be obtained concerning the @xmath3-dependence .",
    "nevertheless , they found a single general form of scaling for every @xmath3 of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "they also found their scaling law to work down to @xmath8 k , as theoretically expected for critical sf at a qcp .",
    "in table i are reported the main physical quantities that characterize the paramagnetic heavy fermion compounds cecu@xmath148 and ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 at low temperatures .",
    "for those two compounds , a fermi liquid regime is obtained at low temperatures and characterizes their strong coupling renormalized state : the linear coefficient @xmath150 of the specific heat is found to be constant and highly renormalized for temperatures @xmath151 @xcite , and the resistivity behaves as @xmath152 for @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the temperatures @xmath82 , @xmath92 , and @xmath154 have been obtained by ins @xcite , as in the present study .",

    "this is probably because these scaling laws are obtained in a @xmath13-range where kondo sf are temperature dependent . even at the qcp of an itinerant heavy fermion system ,",
