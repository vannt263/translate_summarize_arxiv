    "the estimate is inherited in the limit .",
    "note that this estimate excludes the trivial solution @xmath110 .",
    "our proof consists of a geometric part and a pde part .",
    "the geometric part is concerned with positivity ; it utilizes the gradient flow @xmath111 in the sobolev space of equivariant maps @xmath112 .",
    "we establish that the set of positive maps @xmath113 is strongly ( positively ) invariant under the flow . with the help of this invariance",

    "they proceed via dirichlet problems and build up a higher - dimensional object out of lower - dimensional solutions .",
    "we instead construct a nontrivial solution via neumann problems , which can later be dissected ( not done in the present paper ) .",
    "the paper @xcite contains some seeds of the present work .",
    "symmetry is a rather restrictive assumption . a possible approach for relaxing it could be to establish the stability of the constructed solution(s ) in the class of general compact perturbations .",
    "this is reasonable for at least some of these solutions which enjoy extra minimality properties ( as , for example , the triple - junction solution ) .",

    "finally , in light of @xcite , uniqueness should not be expected in general .",
    "the scalar problem related to , for @xmath126 , and without any symmetry hypotheses on the potential , has been the object of intensive investigation for many years , with the de giorgi conjecture and the related contributions at the center of this activity ( see the expository article of farina and valdinoci @xcite ) .",

    "a triple - well in @xmath128 or a quadruple - well in @xmath129 would be appropriate for modeling coexistence of three or four phases correspondingly , with the origin @xmath130 representing the coexistence point .",
    "on the geometric side , the rescaled solution @xmath131 in the triple- and quadruple - well cases is expected to converge , as @xmath132 , to the solution of the corresponding partitioning problem ( see baldo @xcite ) .",
