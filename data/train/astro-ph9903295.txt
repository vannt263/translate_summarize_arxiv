    "bl lacertae objects are a very enigmatic type of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "they are highly luminous ( e.g. , log @xmath0 44 - 46 ergs s@xmath1 ; morris et al . 1991 , hereafter m91 ) , dominated by a non - thermal , nearly - featureless continuum ( which often makes redshift determinations difficult ) and exhibit several characteristics indicative of relativistic outflows nearly along the line of sight ( e.g. , doppler - boosted luminosity : padovani & urry 1990 ; apparent superluminal motion of vlbi radio components : zensus 1989 ; and variability on timescales as short as minutes to hours : heidt & wagner 1996 ) . indeed ,",
    "bl lacs display some of the most extreme behavior of any class of agn .",
    "given their large x - ray luminosities bl lacs are found in modestly large numbers in x - ray surveys ( e.g. , 43 in the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) : stocke et al .",
    "1991 , rector et al . 1999 ; 66 in the _ einstein _  slew survey \" : perlman et al . 1996b ; and 120 in the rosat - green bank ( rgb ) catalog : laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "there may well be of order 1000 bl lacs hidden among all the sources in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; e.g. , nass et al .",
    "1996 ; bade et al .",
    "1998 ) .    many observations ( e.g. , extended radio luminosity and morphology : antonucci & ulvestad 1985 ; perlman & stocke 1993 ; host galaxy luminosity and morphology : abraham et al .",
    "1991 ; wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ; comparative space densities and luminosity functions : padovani and urry 1990 , m91 ) suggest that bl lac objects are relativistically - beamed `` fanaroff & riley class 1 '' ( fr-1 ) radio galaxies , which are low - luminosity , edge - darkened sources often found in rich and poor cluster environments .",
    "bl lacs discovered by both x - ray - selection ( xbls ) and radio - selection ( rbls ) techniques share these characteristics , strongly suggesting that xbls and rbls are from the same parent population .",
    "and although xbls and rbls have somewhat different observed properties ( e.g. , xbls have larger starlight and smaller polarized flux fractions optically : m91 ; jannuzi et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 and lower radio core dominance values : perlman & stocke 1993 , laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1993 ) , most of these differences can be accomodated either by invoking different mean viewing angles , wherein xbls are viewed further from their beaming axis ( e.g. , stocke et al .",
    "1989 ) or by invoking different electron energy distributions ( giommi & padovani 1994 ) .",
    "but many rbls have extended radio and optical emission - line luminosities inconsistent with being fr-1s ( rector & stocke 1999 ) and , most suprising , stocke & rector ( 1997 ) have found a large excess of mgii absorption systems in the 1jy rbl sample , suggestive of gravitational lensing .",
    "thus , while xbls seem mostly consistent with being beamed fr-1s , rbls seem to be a mixture of beamed fr-1s and fr-2s as well as a few gravitationally - lensed quasars .    recent work on the clustering environments of bl lacs by wurtz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) finds that bl lacs avoid rich clusters and the most luminous galaxies ( i.e. , the brightest cluster galaxies ) at low redshifts , suggesting that there may be a problem with this simple picture .",
    "also , owen , ledlow & keel ( 1996 ) failed to find substantial numbers of bl lac candidates among their large ( @xmath2 ) sample of rich cluster radio galaxies .",
    "either there exists some physical reason why bl lacs avoid rich clusters at low @xmath3 or current surveys systematically miss bl lacs in rich clusters ( see wurtz et al .",
    "1997 for suggested reasons ) .",
    "another observation that does not fit the simple beamed fr-1 picture is the disparity in  values for rbls and xbls ( @xmath4 for rbls in the 1jy survey ; rector & stocke 1999 ; @xmath5 for xbls in the emss ; m91 , perlman et al .",
    "1996b ) , which suggests that they may be from different populations and/or that one or both samples are incomplete .",
    "indeed , della ceca ( 1993 ) first pointed out that raising the x - ray flux limit of the emss sample to @xmath6 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 raises  to @xmath8 , which is consistent with no evolution .",
    "thus incompleteness of the emss sample at faint fluxes is a real concern .",
    "browne & march ( 1993 ; hereafter bm93 ) and march & browne ( 1995 ; hereafter mb95 ) describe an effect which can make radio- and x - ray - selected bl lacs difficult to recognize optically , thus introducing the possibility that such samples are incomplete : a bl lac object at low redshift with a flux density near the survey limit ( i.e. , a  low - luminosity bl lac \" ) would be difficult to identify optically because the weak nonthermal continuum from the agn could be fainter than the starlight from the luminous host elliptical galaxy , thus causing these x - ray or radio sources to be misidentified as either `` normal '' elliptical galaxies or as clusters of galaxies rather than as bl lacs .",
    "this effect ( hereafter called the",
    " b - m effect \" ) will result in a paucity of bl lacs at low @xmath3 , thus flattening the observed x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) at the low - luminosity end ( mb95 ) .",
    "the  for the sample will also be artificially decreased , as this effect causes the flux limit of the sample to be underestimated .",
    "bm93 suggested that the emss bl lac sample may be incomplete on the basis of the sample flux limit and the xlf .",
    "however , in a more detailed analysis mb95 find that , while there is some evidence for `` hidden '' bl lacs , the xlf and  statistics of the emss sample can not be altered significantly by this selection effect ; and so it probably can not explain the  discrepancy between the emss and 1jy samples ( mb95 ) .",
    "in this paper we present evidence for a small population of low - luminosity bl lac objects that were originally misidentified as clusters of galaxies in the emss (  2 ) .",
    "these objects were identified using rosat hri observations which reveal the presence of point - like x - ray emission at the location of a low - power radio galaxy , thus revealing the presence of a weak agn (  3 ) .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy and vla imaging confirm that these sources are bl lacs (  4 ) .",
    "individual sources are discussed in  5 . since the emss is the only statistically - complete x - ray - selected sample of bl lacs for which the xlf and evolution have been calculated",
    ", these results affect the xlf and evolution determinations as well as physical models of bl lacs ( e.g. , ghisellini & maraschi 1989 ) .",
    "however , based upon the small number of new emss bl lacs discovered , the modifications to earlier xlf evolution and  determinations are slight (  6 . )",
    "the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia et al .",
    "1990 ; stocke et al . 1991 ; maccacaro et al .",
    "1994 ) contains 835 faint ( @xmath9 x @xmath10 ergs",
    "@xmath7 s@xmath1 in the @xmath11 kev soft x - ray band ) x - ray sources discovered serendipitously with _",
    "einstein _ imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) images obtained of various targets at high galactic latitude ( @xmath12 ) . to be included in the emss a source detection limit of 4@xmath13 above the x - ray plus detector backgrounds is imposed .",
    "the full emss sample of bl lac objects currently consists of 43 objects with x - ray fluxes from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 in the 0.3 - 3.5 kev band ( rector et al .",
    "the identification of these objects followed both a spectroscopic and a photometric set of criteria as outlined in stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , as did the identification of the other classes of x - ray sources identified in the emss ( e.g. , qsos and seyferts , clusters of galaxies , normal galaxies and galactic stars ) .",
    "based upon the nearly complete identifications of sources in the emss survey , we assembled a list of the best candidates of potentially misidentified clusters of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we concentrated our efforts on the emss subsample from which the `` complete '' bl lac sample of m91 was extracted .",
    "this sample of bl lacs was selected by the following criteria : an x - ray flux of @xmath16 x @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 and a declination limit of @xmath17 .",
    "the x - ray - selected objects drawn from the emss using these constraints are fully identified ; thus incompleteness of the m91 bl lac sample can only occur from the misidentification of sources .",
    "the sample selected for rosat hri observations includes all suspect sources within the bounds of the m91 subsample plus the best cases for misidentified bl lacs in the rest of the emss .",
    "our criteria for what constitutes a suspect source are detailed below .      in compiling the suspect source list we eliminated",
    "very well - resolved x - ray sources whose extended flux so dominates over any possibly embedded point source that it would be below the flux limit of the emss .",
    "many of the emss clusters have been studied with rosat , confirming their extended nature .",
    "so , using either rosat pspc or hri or the original _ einstein _",
    "ipc images , the maximum point source contribution to the ipc detect cell counts is measured by fitting a point source at the location of the the detected cluster radio galaxy or galaxies . since most emss sources were detected quite close to the signal - to - noise limit ( 4@xmath13 ) , it was unlikely that any point source contribution to extended cluster emission would be detected on its own .",
    "but , it is important to note that , while these radio galaxies might be excluded from being emss bl lacs , they still could be low - luminosity bl lacs ; i.e. , the cluster is the correct x - ray identification , but a low - luminosity bl lac is nevertheless present within the cluster .",
    "one such source ( ms 0011.7 + 0837 ) was discovered in the course of this study .",
    "x - ray clusters lacking radio sources were also eliminated from the suspect list , as radio - quiet bl lacs are not believed to exist ( stocke et al .",
    "vla surveys of emss clusters ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 , stocke et al .",
    "1999 ) have been conducted , which are deep enough to detect most fr-1 radio galaxies in a cluster .",
    "the vla snapshot survey of all emss sources reported in stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) has a 5@xmath13 detection limit of @xmath18 1 mjy at 5 ghz , which should be sufficient to detect radio galaxies in nearby clusters ( a detection limit of log @xmath19 w hz@xmath1 for @xmath20 ) .",
    "a deeper vla survey has recently been completed at 1.4 ghz for all emss clusters with z @xmath21 0.3 ( stocke et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these new observations were timed to achieve a point - source radio power limit of log @xmath22 23.5 w hz@xmath1 . while this limit is not quite deep enough to detect all fr-1s , bl lacs have doppler - boosted cores which add significantly to the total radio power level of an fr-1 .",
    "thus , the combination of these two sets of radio observations should be adequate to detect all potential bl lacs in emss clusters .",
    "using the observed optical luminosities of bl lac host galaxies from wurtz , stocke & yee ( 1996 ) , the power limits of the above mentioned vla surveys require that any non - detection falls at @xmath23 0.2 , well below the level of bl lacs ( see stocke et al .",
    "1991 and section 6 herein ) .",
    "therefore , we have eliminated clusters from the suspect list if no radio sources were detected by these surveys .    clusters with radio galaxies whose optical spectra are dominated by bright emission lines ( i.e. , `` cooling flow '' clusters ) were originally eliminated from the suspect list due to the usual bl lac classification criterion which requires `` featureless '' optical spectra ( see below )",
    ". however , the luminous , low - ionization optical emission lines found in the spectra of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in cooling flow clusters are very extended and not directly related to either the broad- or narrow - line regions of an agn .",
    "moreover , these clusters also contain central `` cusps '' in their x - ray surface brightness distributions , which could hide the presence of a low - luminosity point source associated with the bcg and these bcgs are often weak radio emitters .",
    "thus , these bcgs are potential low - luminosity bl lac objects if we ignore the optical line emission .",
    "so , although the presence of an x - ray point source is not the usual interpretation for the x - ray `` cusps '' in cooling flow clusters ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) , we have scrutinized all the cooling flow clusters whose bcgs are radio galaxies to ensure that the excess central surface brightness could not hide a point source so luminous that a potential emss bl lac could be present ( see above ) .",
    "eleven such clusters were scrutinized using archival rosat and/or einstein data .",
    "all but four of these clusters are easily too extended to harbor a point source luminous enough to be a member of the emss sample .",
    "two of these four ( ms 0102.3 + 3255 & ms 1244.2 + 7114 ) are marginally resolved by current observations so that a bl lac could be present .",
    "another cooling flow cluster ( ms 1455.0 + 2232 ) is very well - resolved by a pointed pspc observation .",
    "but , because this source was detected at a very high significance level in the emss , an embedded point source of only @xmath18 20% of the ipc detect cell flux would still be an emss source . since the cooling flow `` cusp '' in the pspc image of this source could hide a point source which is @xmath18 15% of the detect cell flux , we must consider the bcg in ms 1455.0 + 2232 a possible low - luminosity bl lac . the final source ( ms 2348.0 + 2913 ) appears unresolved both in the rosat all - sky survey and in an off - axis pspc pointing and so must be considered a likely bl lac object . however , since we had not considered the possibility that `` cooling flow clusters '' could contain bl lacs until this point was raised by the referee , we were unable to obtain rosat hri images of these interesting sources .",
    "no emss sources identified as `` normal '' galaxies meet the above criteria to be suspect ; most normal galaxies have quite extended x - ray emission and only a few are radio emitters .",
    "we note that deep rosat hri observations of normal galaxies from the emss catalog by ourselves and others ( dahlem & stuhrmann 1998 ; stocke , rector & griffiths 1999 ) do not find galaxies with strong , nuclear point sources .",
    "any point sources present do not dominate the total x - ray flux ; thus these objects were not detected as bl lacs on the basis of their x - ray emission and so would not be included in the emss bl lac sample .",
    "a total of seven candidates for misidentification emerged from this selection process , all of which have been observed by the rosat hri ( excepting the four cooling flow clusters identified as suspect only after the hri observations were obtained ) .",
    "these are all of the sources in the emss subsample of m91 that meet the above criteria .",
    "because it is possible that low - luminosity bl lacs may be present in the emss but not in the bright m91 complete subsample , we have also included five additional emss sources which meet the selection criteria to be suspect identifications but are below the flux or declination limits of the m91 sample .",
    "these five may not be all of the suspect sources in the emss sample which are outside the m91 subsample , but are just the best cases we have found to this date .",
    "all of these objects have been observed by the rosat hri as well .    besides these new hri observations , the classification criteria previously used to classify an x - ray source as a bl lac require both optical spectroscopy and radio imaging .",
    "therefore , we obtained new optical and radio data to determine whether these new candidates meet these bl lac criteria .",
    "but , because these new sources may stretch the boundaries of the bl lac class , the previously used criteria may need modification .",
    "these criteria are ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) : ( 1 ) unresolved at x - ray wavelengths ; ( 2 ) comparable to or more luminous than a typical fr-1 radio galaxy at radio wavelengths ( e.g. , log @xmath19 w hz@xmath1 ) .",
    "( 3 ) `` featureless '' optical spectra in terms of emission lines ( i.e. , any emission line must be quite weak ; i.e. , @xmath24 ) ; and ( 4 ) `` featureless '' optical spectra in terms of absorption lines ( i.e. , the presence of a nonthermal component to the optical continuum , as indicated by a caii break `` contrast '' of @xmath25 ; which corresponds to @xmath26 as defined in dressler & shectman 1987 ) .",
    "the last two criteria are somewhat arbitrary as originally described by stocke et al .",
    "specifically , criterion # 4 is violated by three objects herein which are otherwise bl lac - like , as bm93 predicted .",
    "further , march et al . ( 1996 ) proposed a further relaxation of the criteria , which is discussed in  6 .",
    "also because some low - luminosity bl lacs may be embedded in extended cluster x - ray emission , criterion # 1 may need reevaluation as well . for sources observed with the vla ,",
    "an edge - darkened fr-1 extended radio luminosity and morphology surrounding a bright point source is expected but is not required for classifying the source as a bl lac , since a few bl lacs have fr-2 morphologies . also implicit in the above criteria is that the x - ray and radio core positions must coincide .",
    "we note that optical polarization , often a criterion used for classification of bl lacs , is not considered here primarily because polarimetry has not yet been obtained for these objects .",
    "however , polarimetry blueward of the caii break would provide important confirmation that the present candidates are bl lac objects .",
    "a secondary set of photometric criteria were also used in stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to cross - check potential identifications . specifically for bl lac objects ,",
    "a broad - band color criterion is made possible by their unique spectral energy distributions .",
    "that is , xbls are found to occupy a nearly unique area in the ( @xmath27 ) plot ( see  4 ) , where these spectral indices refer to radio - to - optical and optical - to - x - ray respectively as defined in stocke et al .",
    "this criterion was rigorously tested by using the _ einstein _ slew survey data to predict bl lac object identifications ( perlman et al .",
    "1996a ) and was found to be @xmath28% successful in predicting such identifications prior to optical spectroscopy . as with",
    "previously identified emss bl lacs , we will use this photometric criterion to check low - luminosity bl lac candidates .",
    "twelve bl lac candidates were observed with the rosat hri during ao1 , ao5 and ao7 . the log of rosat observations for our sample are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "[ 1 ] is the emss object name",
    "[ 2]-[4 ] list the rosat observation request ( ror ) number , the date of the pointed observation , and the effective exposure time ; col [ 5 ] indicates whether or not the object meets the emss complete subsample criterion of m91 described above ; and cols [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] list the hri position of the source ; for extended sources the position marks the peak flux .",
    "ximage ( v2.5 ; part of the xanadu package ) and ftools ( v.4.0 ) were used to determine whether or not a source was resolved by matching the nominal on - axis encircled energy function ( eef ) of the hri to the radial profile of each source .",
    "the eef should be viewed as the hri response function to a point source ; however , other effects ( e.g. , pointing  jitter \" and aspect solution errors ; morse 1994 ) may alter the actual point source response from the eef .",
    "the radial profiles for the unresolved and resolved sources are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] respectively .",
    "radial profiles for ms 1317.0 - 2111 and ms 1520.1 + 3002 are not shown because no x - ray source was detected by the hri at the position of the radio galaxy for either source .",
    "six sources are unambiguously unresolved , one ( ms 0011.7 + 0837 ) is marginally resolved and the remaining are well - resolved by these observations .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that even the unresolved sources do not exactly match the the eef at a radius of @xmath29 , whereas 87% of the point - source flux should be within this radius .",
    "this is due to a halo in excess of the nominal eef at a radius of @xmath30 .",
    "this `` excess halo '' has been noted in other hri observational programs , including the calibration star hz 43 , but an explanation has not yet been found ( d.e .",
    "harris 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "since the `` excess halo '' is also consistently present in the point spread function of stars within the fields of our observations , we are confident that these sources are not resolved despite this @xmath31 excess over the nominal eef . contoured , grey - scale hri maps of the resolved sources are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "two sources ( ms 0011.7 + 0837 and ms 1826.5 + 7256 ) did not exactly match the hri eef and it was questionable as to whether or not they were resolved . after further analysis of ms 0011.7 + 0837",
    "we are confident that it is spatially resolved . to confirm that its extended flux was not due to misalignment of the individual observation intervals ( `` obis '' ) or jitter within each obi",
    ", the following test was done on the nearby emss source ms 0011.6 + 0840 , a bright k0 v star fortuitously within the field of the hri and sufficiently `` on axis '' to have the same eef ( its offset from field center is 4.8 ) .",
    "the observation was split into the four different obis and the centroid for ms 0011.6 + 0840 was determined for each obi .",
    "the obis were then restacked , with each obi linearly shifted to align the centroids .",
    "ms 0011.7 + 0837 and ms 0011.6 + 0840 were then compared to the hri eef .",
    "the original stacking of obis suffered from minor misalignment , and there is some evidence for jitter within two of the four obis .",
    "however , the energy profile for ms 0011.6 + 0840 extracted from the restacked image matches the nominal hri eef quite well while the energy profile for ms 0011.7 + 0837 does not ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) ; the probability that the energy profile of ms 0011.7 + 0837 is the same as ms 0011.6 + 0840 is @xmath32% ( the variance summed over all the annuli is @xmath33 ) .",
    "further , ms 0011.7 + 0837 is significantly elongated along the e - w axis ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , because ms 0011.7 + 0837 contains either a radio galaxy or low - luminosity bl lac embedded in extended cluster emission , we have included it in the other tests of the unresolved sources for thoroughness ( see below ) .",
    "the hri field for ms 1826.5 + 7256 also contains an unidentified star at @xmath34 ( b1950 ) , which allowed us to perform the same analysis as above .",
    "the radial energy profiles for neither ms 1826.5 + 7256 nor the in - field star match the hri eef .",
    "however , the radial energy profile for ms 1826.5 + 7256 is completely consistent with that of the star ; the probability that they are the same is @xmath35% ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the cause of the poor fit of ms 1826.5 + 7256 and the star to the nominal hri eef is unknown , but the integration time for this source was significantly longer than for the other sources , so it may have been caused by excessive jitter ( ms 1826.5 + 7256 was observed in ao1 ) .",
    "the hri position of ms 1826.5 + 7256 coincides with the optical position of a faint m5 v star ( v @xmath37 ) at @xmath38 ( b1950 ) .",
    "so ms 1826.5 + 7256 is unresolved , but it is not a bl lac . note that the optical position of ms 1826.5 + 7256 given in maccacaro et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is in error ; the optical position given is that of a k star @xmath39 to the ne of the true optical identification at the position quoted above .",
    "the fluxes of the unresolved sources were measured by using an aperture of 75  in radius to determine the source count rate . as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "this radius is more than sufficient to enclose all the flux from the source .",
    "the background count rate was determined by using a 100  to 200  annulus around the source ; the background was then subtracted from the source count rate .",
    "the hri has essentially no spectral resolution so the counts are modeled using a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray spectral index @xmath41 was estimated using the luminosity vs. x - ray spectral index correlation from padovani & giommi ( 1996 ) for all but ms 1019.0 + 5139 and ms 1209.0 + 3917 . the spectral index for these two sources",
    "was determined by rosat pspc observations ( blair et al .",

    "it is possible that faint , very extended structure from an associated cluster may be present around some of the unresolved sources .",
    "this extended emission may have been detected by the low - resolution _",
    "ipc but was undetected by the higher - resolution rosat hri due to a lower signal - to - noise ratio per pixel for the hri . to determine whether or not there was any `` missing flux '' in the hri observations we converted the hri flux to an `` expected '' ipc flux by accounting for the different bands of the rosat hri ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) and the _ einstein _ ipc ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) .",
    "we assume the x - ray spectral index @xmath47 for the bl lac to be valid across the _ einstein _ ipc band , which is reasonable because the hri and ipc bands significantly overlap .",
    "the hri flux measurements are comparable ( i.e. , within 50% ) to the ipc flux for three of the five bl lac candidates .",
    "the exceptions , ms 1019.0 + 5139 and ms 1205.7 - 2921 , are approximately three times brighter than measured by the ipc .",
    "allowing for the variability of bl lac x - ray emission ( factors of @xmath48 are typical ; e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "1995 ) we conclude that the hri flux levels for the five bl lac candidates are consistent with the _ einstein _ ipc flux being entirely from an unresolved bl lac x - ray emitter and that significant amounts of extended diffuse flux are not present . on the other hand ,",
    "the total detected hri flux for ms 0011.7 + 0837 is only 17% of the ipc flux . while it may be possible that this source is a bl lac that was observed by the ipc in a flaring state , it is much more likely that the hri has simply missed faint extended flux associated with a cluster because it is marginally resolved by the hri .",

    ". these objects do meet the relaxed @xmath89 , @xmath52 criteria proposed by march et al .",
    "( 1996 ; see figure  [ fig7 ] ) . like ms 1019.0 + 5139 , the strength of the h@xmath41+[n ii ] emission lines in 3c 264 and ic 310 are comparable to fr-1s ( log @xmath110 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "owen , ledlow & keel ( 1996 ) argue against a bl lac identification for these four objects because they are lobe - dominated radio sources ( @xmath111 ) . while this is unusual for bl lacs , it is consistent with being a source that is not highly beamed .",
    "the relationship of these objects to the low - luminosity bl lacs discovered here is not yet known , although they are similar in many ways .",
    "rosat pspc observations are available for two of these four weak bl lac candidates ( 3c 264 in abell 1367 ; prieto 1996 and ic 310 in the perseus cluster ; rhee et al .",
    "both of these agn have apparent point - source detections which coincide with the radio core , strongly suggestive that they are low - luminosity bl lac objects .",
    "3c 264 and ic 310 have been placed in the ( @xmath27 ) plot in figure  [ fig8 ] by estimating the point - source x - ray fluxes and by correcting the optical flux for the presence of the host elliptical .",
    "their location in the bl lac area confirms our inference that these objects are weak bl lacs .",
    "rosat hri point - source detections at the location of the other two radio galaxies ( 1005 + 006 and 1442 + 195 ) would confirm these to be bl lac objects as well as provide confirmation of an important new method for finding low - luminosity bl lacs .",
    "we note that 3c 264 is a member of the 1jy catalog ( khr et al .",
    "1981 ) ; thus , if it is indeed a bl lac the 1jy sample of bl lacs ( stickel et al . 1991 ) is incomplete ( mb95 ) .",
    "we investigate this issue further in another paper ( rector & stocke 1999 ) .",
    "of the five newly discovered emss bl lacs only two are in the complete m91 sample .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these two new bl lacs are the two lowest in the m91 sample , with an average luminosity ( log @xmath112@xmath113@xmath114 = 44.10 ) somewhat lower than the other bl lacs in the m91 sample ( log @xmath112@xmath113@xmath114 = 45.32 ) .",
    "a @xmath115-test shows the difference in luminosity distributions to be significant ( probability @xmath116% ) ; so a few low - luminosity bl lacs were systematically misclassified as clusters of galaxies in the original accounting of the emss .",
    "are these the  low - luminosity \" bl lacs predicted by bm93 ?",
    "bm93 estimate that the probability of correctly identifying a bl lac with a flux near the sample limit drops dramatically with decreasing redshift because the weak nonthermal continuum from the agn will be dominated by the host galaxy starlight .",
    "optically this object s spectrum could have too strong a caii break to be classified as a bl lac using the criterion suggested by stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . based upon this optical classification criterion bm93 estimate that a bl lac in the emss sample at @xmath117 would have a probability of less than 30% ( and those at @xmath118 have less than 5% ) of being correctly identified as bl lacs in the emss survey .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that both of the newly identified bl lacs in the m91 sample are at a @xmath119 and have caii breaks which slightly exceed the bl lac criterion .",
    "however , in their analysis bm93 assume an x - ray flux limit for the emss sample of @xmath120 jy ( @xmath121 x @xmath10 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 for the ipc band ) , which is more than six times fainter than the cutoff for the the complete m91 sample .",
    "due to its bright flux limit the m91 complete sample is relatively immune to the problem of misidentification described in bm93 .",
    "mb95 estimate that 25% of the full emss cluster sample ( 5 or 6 objects ) were misidentified ; therefore it is not surprising that we have discovered only two instances of misidentification in the m91 sample .",
    "an analysis of a complete x - ray sample with a much fainter flux limit ( @xmath122 jy ) is necessary to confirm the bm93 hypothesis .",
    "such an analysis is in progress using the fainter sources in the emss ( rector et al .",
    "1999 ) .    because of its moderate sensitivity and substantial sky coverage the emss is a suitable survey for discovering low - luminosity bl lacs .",
    "these new objects allow the xbl x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) to be extended to slightly lower energies ( @xmath123 log @xmath124 ) .",
    "the number of objects discovered at these lower energies ( two : ms 1019.0 + 5139 and ms 1050.7 + 4946 ) is consistent with an extrapolation of the previous xlf derived in m91 ; that is , we do not measure any significant steepening or flattening of the xlf to lower luminosities ( log @xmath125 ) than the previously published xlf in m91 .",
    "including these two new low - luminosity bl lac objects slightly raises the  value for the m91 xbl sample to @xmath126 .",
    "since the latest value for the 1jy radio - selected bl lac sample is  @xmath127 ( rector & stocke 1999 ) , these newly discovered bl lacs do not ameliorate the discrepancy between xbls and rbls . therefore , the possibility that these two selection techniques are sensitive to finding different types of bl lacs must still be considered .",
    "because the emss is a  serendipitous \" survey , it is possible the m91 sample may have been biased against previously known low-@xmath3 , bright bl lacs which were targets of ipc observations .",
    "however , the number of such objects in the 835 deg@xmath68 sky coverage of the emss is likely quite small , @xmath128 object based upon known space densities ( m91 , perlman et al .",
    "1996a ) . a recent sample selected by the rass ( bade et al .",
    "1998 ) confirms this effect as it finds three bl lacs at @xmath118 in a sky area rougly three times that surveyed by the emss ; two of these bl lacs ( mkn 180 and i zw 187 ) were previously known .",
    "if either of these two objects were included in the emss , the  would slightly decrease due to their high flux .",
    "therefore , the xbl / rbl  discrepancy remains despite this selection bias in the emss .",
    "further , the new rass xbl samples of bade et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and giommi , menna & padovani ( 1998 ) confirm the negative evolution of xbls .    a discussion of the impact of these observations on the cluster x - ray luminosity function will be included in a future publication ( lewis , stocke , ellingson & gioia 1999 ) .",
    "we have used the rosat hri to search for bl lac objects originally misidentified as galaxies or clusters of galaxies within the emss sample .",
    "five new bl lacs have been identified by this process , two of which are new members of the m91 complete subsample . therefore , such misidentifications do not significantly affect the completeness of the bl lac sample of m91 . because only two of the seven potential m91 subsample objects were found to be bl lacs ( and only 5 of 12 overall ) ; and because these 12 were reobserved with the rosat hri as the most likely misdentifications we expect that there are very few remaining misidentified sources in the emss .",
    "it is also unlikely that many more low - luminosity bl lacs will be discovered within the emss as nearly all the potential candidates have been investigated .",
    "thus we believe that contamination of the emss sample from misidentification is not significant .    while it was the intention of this observing program to obtain rosat hri images of all suspect x - ray sources in the m91 subsample , we had not considered the possibility ( raised by the referee ) that `` cooling flow '' clusters might hide point x - ray sources in their central surface brightness `` cusps . ''",
    "we had not made this consideration heretofore because this is not the usual interpretation of these cusps ( fabian 1994 ) and because the bcgs / radio galaxies in these clusters contain luminous emission lines in their optical spectra which easily exceed the equivalent width limits proposed for bl lacs in stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . however , these luminous , low ionization emission lines are also very spatially extended and so not obviously related to an agn broad- or narrow - line region .",
    "once we reconsidered these cooling flow clusters , most were found to be too extended to harbor point sources luminous enough to be members of the emss sample on their own ; but four clusters could not be so eliminated and so remain as potential ( but not proven to be ) bl lac objects .",
    "these are ms 0102.3 + 3255 , ms 1244.2 + 7114 , ms 1455.0 + 2232 & ms 2348.0 + 2913 .",
    "so , while it was the intention of this study to complete the m91 bl lac sample , these four clusters were not observed with the hri and so the m91 bl lac sample may , indeed , contain a few more low - luminosity bl lacs .",
    "nevertheless , our results generally agree with the predictions of bm93 .",
    "the properties of the low - luminosity bl lacs we have discovered are consistent with the low - luminosity bl lacs predicted . and at the relatively bright flux limit of the m91 sample , mb95 predict very few low - luminosity bl lacs would be misidentified , as we have found .",
    "thus the b - m effect does not explain the  discrepancy between the m91 emss sample and 1jy bl lac sample , even if all four of the cooling flow clusters are included in the m91 bl lac sample .",
    "the properties of the newly discovered bl lacs are suggestive of a transition population between bl lacs and fr-1 radio galaxies , however their properties are too similar to that of the other bl lacs in the emss sample to completely  bridge the gap \" between xbls and standard fr-1s in all their properties . but based upon this small study , surveys with significantly larger sky area and similar sensitivity ( e.g. , the rass ) will likely find numerous examples of low - luminosity bl lacs whose properties are continuous between luminous x - ray selected bl lacs , as found in the emss and slew surveys , and normal fr-1 radio galaxies like m87 . indeed , the rgb ( laurent - muelheisen et al . 1999 ) and deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ; perlman et al .",
    "1998 ) surveys have found significant numbers of bl lacs within this gap .",
    "these fainter surveys are also more susceptible to the problem of recognition of low - luminosity bl lacs at low redshift , thus allowing for a more definitive test of the b - m effect .",
    "finally , the confirmation of ic 310 and 3c 264 as low - luminosity bl lac objects suggests that other , nearby x - ray luminous clusters could harbor low - luminosity bl lacs ( similar to the case presented here for ms 0011.7 + 0837 ) .",
    "since many x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath118 were targeted by the _ einstein _",
    "ipc , the emss would not have included these sources .",
    "however , the spectral results of owen , ledlow & keel ( 1996 ) , which included enormous numbers of nearby abell cluster radio galaxies , suggests that the numbers of low - luminosity bl lacs in rich clusters is quite small .",
    "still , rosat hri images of suspect radio galaxies in nearby rich clusters , particularly the `` cooling flow '' clusters , should be targeted as potential bl lac objects ( e.g. , 1005 + 006 & 1442 + 195 from the owen et al .",
    "similarly , hri ( or axaf hrc ) observations should be obtained for the five @xmath117 bl lac candidates discovered in march et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which exceed the @xmath89 , @xmath52 criteria of stocke et al .",
    "their ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) values , once corrected for the presence of the host galaxy , could confirm their classification as bl lac objects , thus accounting for the marked absence of bl lacs at @xmath117 .",
