    "a direct coupling of the bond stretching ( bs ) inplane ( @xmath0 ) phonon modes to density fluctuations of strongly correlated electrons has been discussed as a possible reason of their anomalous properties @xcite,@xcite .",
    "doping dependent anomalies of these high energy ( @xmath1 mev ) phonon branches are observed in a number of perovskite materials like cuprates , bismuthates , manganites , nickelates @xcite-@xcite . in particular , presence of a strong ( more than @xmath2 ) softening of the bs phonon dispersion towards the brillouin zone boundary in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions contrasts a very week dispersion in the diagonal direction @xmath5 this is paralleled by the phonon linewidth that reaches unusually large values too , @xmath6 mev , in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in some materials softening can also be non - monotonous and one observes a minimum at intermediate momenta , e.g. @xmath7 r.l.u .",
    "a number of theories and models have been developed to explain the properties of bs phonons .",
    "to mention a few possible scenarios , such as incommensurate charge density wave instability or stripes , acoustic and optical plasmons or unusual dielectric properties ( overscreening , when the dielectric constant becomes negative at some momenta ) as well as calculations based on ab - initio lda , e.g. falter , or strong electron correlations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "different scenarios refer to different energy scale of the charge excitations coupled to bs phonons . in most cases",
    "its direct experimental measurement is not available , because it requires a sufficient momentum resolution at relatively low energies .",
    "most of the present knowledge comes from optical experiments , i.e. small momentum @xmath8 where the coupling to the bs phonon mode is vanishing . in this context",
    "it seems interesting to consider the phonon itself as a probe of the charge excitation .",
    "we employ a semiphenomenological model where the charge response coupled to the phonon is parametrized in a simple form . to determine all three parameters",
    "some additional measurements of the bs mode properties are required .",
    "we propose to consider dependence on oxygen isotope substitution of phonon dispersion and linewidth .",
    "this would allow not only to determine the parameters of the model but also to test its validity , since the number of equations is larger than required by selfconsistency .",
    "the dyson equation for the renormalized phonon propagator can be written in the form@xmath9 where the structure factor corresponds to @xmath3 , @xmath10 is the bare frequency , @xmath11 is the coupling constant @xcite and @xmath12 the charge susceptibility .",
    "the latter is taken in the lorentzian form@xmath13 with unknown dispersion @xmath14 linewidth @xmath15 and oscillator strength @xmath16 the model ( [ phonon ] ) , ( [ mode ] ) defines the equation for the phonon frequency@xmath17 and linewidth@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "analysis of above equations shows that according to observed features of the bs softening , dispersion @xmath20 along @xmath3 and @xmath4 should be much smaller than in diagonal direction , that agrees with results based on @xmath21 model @xcite .",
    "we then estimate the values of @xmath15 by substituting known data on @xmath22 and @xmath23 into ( [ damping ] ) and changing the values of @xmath24 after these results are confronted with data on optical absorption , it follows that the relevant charge excitation should be located in the mid infrared region , @xmath25 ev .",
    "this is further corroborated by the analysis of its doping dependence in some cuprates @xcite as compared to softening of the bs phonons .",
    "additional information can be extracted by considering the effect of the isotope mass shift @xmath26 on dispersion @xmath27 and linewidth @xmath28 . in particular ,",
    "the model yields@xmath29@xmath30 in the lowest order of the @xmath31 expansion .",
    "we further define the momentum dependent isotope coefficient @xmath32 @xmath33 that allows to introduce a new relation to the parameters of the charge excitation derived in the same approximation@xmath34if @xmath31 is not small , i.e. dynamic effects are important , the full expressions should be used ( not given here ) .",
    "( [ q1]-[e3 ] ) contain the relation between experimentally measurable characteristics of the phonon spectrum and the parameters of the model describing the charge excitation . on the basis of available data",
    "the model predicts that the energy of charge excitation responsible for the renormalization of the bs phonon mode is located in the mid infrared region .",
    "its energy is lowered with hole doping and respectively its effect on the bs phonon increases . to be noted that the sign of the differential isotope coefficient ( [ e3 ] ) depends on the ratio of @xmath35 to the linewidth .",
    "we expect that the fingerprint of the broad mir structure will show up in a positive value of this coefficient .",
    "another observation is that phonon linewidth could be a more sensitive probe of the isotope effect than phonon dispersion as seen from ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) ."
