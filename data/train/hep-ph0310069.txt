    "the basic property of the quantum theory of angular momentum is its transformation for the rotation from the longitudinal to transverse direction , making the interference helicity - flip effects the probabilistic ones .",
    "the simplest way to see that is to observe that @xmath0 pauli matrix is a diagonal one , contrary to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and this is a core of the role played by the transversity basis .",
    "the important further distinction comes when free and interacting particles are considered .",
    "the state of free particle is completely described by its wave function , which determines the density matrix @xmath3 , and the coefficients of all mutually orthogonal dirac matrices are fixed . at the same time",
    ", the parametrization of transverse polarized nucleon matrix element [ et82 ] of light - cone quark operator leads to the similar expression , which may be therefore interpreted as a quark density matrix @xmath4 the mass of free particle is now substituted by a parameter of the order of hadron mass @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of various dirac matrices are now different parton distributions .",
    "the transverse spin may be therefore described by the axial or pseudotensor terms .",
    "as the first one enters together with hadron mass , it corresponds to the subleading twist 3 , while the second is just the twist 2 transversity .",
    "the independence of these two functions is not a complete one .",
    "the operator equations of motions [ et82 ] , which are crucial to guarantee both electromagnetic and colour gauge invariance lead to the integral relations between them , including also another important non - perturbative input , namely the quark - gluon correlator @xmath5 : @xmath6 there are two extreme cases : when one may neglect these correlators , and the quark mass @xmath7 is of order of the hadron one @xmath8 , one is coming back to the free particle case and transversity happens to be equal to other spin distributions [ et82 ] .    in the opposite case of very light quark , realized in nature , transversity decouples , so that the very existence of such independent distribution is closely related to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , being the mechanism of generation of the most of the observable mass .",
    "the relation between various spin distributions is restored in some models .",
    "let me briefly discuss the recent calculation @xcite of transversity , which uses the elegant interpretation @xcite as a dis for the interfering vector and scalar currents .",
    "the obtained result is convoluted with the probabilistic momentum space distribution of quark in nucleon .",
    "this allows to perform the calculation in complete analogy with the earlier treatment @xcite of unpolarized and polarized quark distribution .",
    "the obtained result looks especially simple when one neglects the quark mass . in the same approximation within this model",
    "@xcite one reproduces the standard wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) relation , so it may be called the ww approximation for transversity : @xmath9 in particular , taking into account the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule , @xmath10 which is not far from the model estimation @xcite .",
    "although model , in principle , may be applied to any quark flavour , one may have the violation of soffer inequality if @xmath11 , i.e. for d - quarks .",
    "this shows that the adopted probabilistic consideration of parton - hadron transition ( while the interference effects are taken into account on the level of vector and scalar currents only ) works worse for @xmath12-quarks .",
    "one may recall , that standard ww approximation for d - quarks may also violate the positivity bound @xcite .",
    "the appearance of transversity in sidis may be only in the combination with chiral - odd fragmentation function , the most popular one being the t - odd collins fragmentation function @xcite ,    as this quantity does not correspond to the standard one , being the intrinsic transverse momentum dependent , the notion of twist is not so trivial .",
    "the relevant tensor structure is @xmath13 , factor @xmath14 appearing due to the dimensional reasons .",
    "as soon as @xmath8 and @xmath15 are of the same order , any power suppression is absent which is usually considered as a manifestation of leading twist ( two ) contribution .    at the same time , the consideration of transverse momentum dependent functions did not yet receive the full field - theoretical justification beyond the born approximation .",
    "the exception is provided by their expansion over the powers of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , linear in @xmath15 terms constitute nothing else but ww approximation to inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite processes .",
    "it is interesting , that ww approximation may be also obtained in the coordinate representation @xcite , when no reference on the transverse direction is needed .",
    "this suggests the possibility @xcite to consider the collins function in the coordinate space as well .",
    "the tensor structure is than @xmath16 , so that the transverse momentum of the quark @xmath15 is not present and the factor @xmath8 appears now in the numerator , rather in the denominator , due to the dimensional reasons .",
    "however , when one is calculating the weighted ( with @xmath17 , being the transverse momentum of the produces _ pion _ ) average , one is coming to the same result , and @xmath18 corresponds to the _ moment _ of the collins function : @xmath19 and the factor @xmath20 in the denominator of the r.h.s .",
    "is exactly the one resulting from the various appearance of @xmath8 in the definitions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath22 to @xmath8 makes this function the twist-3 one , according to the standard classification ( like , say , the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the trace of the twist-3 nature of @xmath22 is the necessity of @xmath14 factor in the definition of the weighted cross - section , @xmath25 so that the @xmath8 should compensate the dimension of @xmath26 , in order to get the unsuppressed expression .",
    "consequently , if such a factor is not introduced by hand , the result should be suppressed like @xmath8 , analogously to any other twist-3 observable",
    ". this suppression is absent , when @xmath26 of order @xmath8 ( where factorization is , generally speaking , unapplicable beyond born approximation ) are considered .",
    "let us also briefly comment on the complementary mechanism of generation of single spin asymmetry in sidis , namely the sivers function . as it was already discussed earlier @xcite , such a function can be only _ effective _ , ( such a nortion first suggested in @xcite ) or non - universal ( like it is referred to now @xcite ) , in the sense , that the imaginary phase emerges in the interaction , involving also the hard scattering and depending on its type .",
    "in other words , the respective cut , providing the imaginary phase , involves both hard and soft variables .",
    "moreover @xcite , the model calculation @xcite of brodsky , hwang and schmidt , clearly exhibits this property , as well as elegant interpretation of collins @xcite .",
    "let us also mention in this connection , that the similar calculation was performed earlier in twist-3 qcd @xcite for the crossing related process of dilepton photoproduction .",
    "that result , when continued to the region @xmath27 , will also not have any power suppression and looks formally as a twist 2 one .",
    "at the same time , the imaginary phase in the collins function should come from the cut with respect to the jet mass , and is therefore universal .",
    "the recent analysis @xcite seems to confirm this picture .",
    "the description of collins function in coordinate space leads to its twist being equal to 3 , while the absence of power suppression is related to the definition of observables .",
    "the sivers function is expected to be an effective , or non - universal one , contrary to collins function .",
    "the earlier calculation in twist 3 qcd @xcite , when continued to low @xmath26 region , shows no power suppression and may be considered as an estimate of effective sivers function ."
