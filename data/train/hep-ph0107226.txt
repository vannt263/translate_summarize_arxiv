    "<S> we study semileptonic decays @xmath0 , which are suggested to be used to extract the hadronic form factors of @xmath1 meson decays to @xmath2 and the angle of @xmath3 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this would be of great benefit to theoretical studies of @xmath1 nonleptonic decays involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and could lead to a reliable and complementary determination of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratios are estimated to be @xmath7 , which could be extensively studied experimentally at @xmath8 and belle . + * pacs numbers : 13.20he , 12.15hh *    ( 0,0 ) ( 305,290)hep - ph/0107226    semileptonic @xmath1 decays are subjects of considerable interests that have been extensively studied with applications of various nonperturbative theorectical frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> they offer the most direct method to determine the weak mixing angles and to probe strong interaction confinement phenomenology of hadronic transitions . recently </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 has been determined from semileptonic @xmath1 decays and becomes the third most accurately measured cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cleo collaborations @xcite have made measurments of the decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the results @xmath12 it is known that extracting @xmath13 from the measured decay rates require significant inputs from theoretical estimations of the hadronic form factors which involve complex strong - interaction dynamics . with @xmath8 and belle taking data , we are entering a new era of @xmath1 physics . </S>",
    "<S> prospects for accurate measurement of these decay modes become excellent . </S>",
    "<S> we can foresee that the decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 could be also observed at @xmath1 factories in the near future . in this brief report , we study the decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 to show that many interesting physical observables can be extracted from measurments of these decays </S>",
    "<S> .    amplitudes of exclusive semileptonic @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) can be written as @xmath19 where the hadronic transition matrix can be parameterized as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the relevant form factors . </S>",
    "<S> using these notations , the double differential decay width is @xmath23,\\ ] ] where we have neglected the lepton mass .    to calculate the semileptonic decay width </S>",
    "<S> , we have to know precisely the form factors @xmath24 , which challenge our poor knowledge of nonperturbative qcd . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , considerable progress has been made in the calculations of @xmath25 with various theoretical approaches : quark models @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite . combining the results of different approaches , say , predictions of qcd sum rules in low @xmath26 region and of lattice qcd in high @xmath26 region </S>",
    "<S> , we could possibly obtain a good theoretical description of @xmath25 in the whole @xmath26 region . however , both qcd sum rule and lattice calculations of the form factors @xmath27 are not yet available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will use @xmath28 symmetry to relate them to @xmath25 . for @xmath3 mixing , we adopt the scheme @xcite @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the fitted mixing angle @xcite . assuming @xmath28 symmetry , the form factors @xmath32 are related to @xmath33 by the relations @xmath34 the form factor @xmath35 is known to be dominated by @xmath36 pole in the small  recoil region @xmath37 and to scale as @xmath38 in the heavy quark limit @xcite . recent studies @xcite imply the dipole behavior for @xmath39 in the large  recoil region @xmath40 . the easiest way to extrapolate the @xmath26 dependence is to suppose the dipole behavior for @xmath39 @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the pole mass of @xmath43 associated with the weak current induced by the decay .    </S>",
    "<S> becirevic and kaidalov ( bk ) @xcite have also proposed a numerical parameterization which satisfies the heavy quark scaling laws @xcite and most of the known constraints @xcite , @xmath44 we can read from here @xmath45 . using bk parameterization to fit their light  cone qcd sum rule ( lcsr ) calculations , khodjamirian @xmath46 . found @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent results from lattice qcd are @xcite @xmath49 where the two sets of results ( lattice  i , ii ) correspond to two different methods used in ref . @xcite .    to eliminate the effect of large uncertainty in @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> we relate the branching ratios @xmath50 to @xmath51 , and get @xmath52 using the cleo reslut @xcite , @xmath53 , and the relations @xmath54 , @xmath31 , we get @xmath55 we can see that the predictions of lcsr form factors @xcite agree very well with those of lattice ( i , ii ) qcd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> averging predictions from lattice qcd and lcsr , we obtain @xmath56    we note that the ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 are independent of the value of @xmath59 , but very sensitive to the details of its @xmath26 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that to give the same numerical predictions for @xmath60 , the @xmath59 for dipole parameterization should be smaller than that for bk parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> if the same value @xmath59 is used in both bk and dipole parameterizations , one will find @xmath61 which implies that the dipole form factor will overestimate the decay rates because @xmath62 meson is very light and the lepton pair invariant mass @xmath26 can be very near the @xmath63 pole . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , theoretical predictions for @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 in turn ) are very sensitive to the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath66 . it is well known that the extraction of @xmath6 from decay rates of @xmath67 suffers from large theoretical uncertainities in the hadronic form factors . </S>",
    "<S> testing the predictions and eventual measurements of @xmath68 can provide valuable information on the hadronic form factors governing @xmath69 decays , and hence lead to a reliable determination of @xmath6 . with much more data to arrive soon from @xmath1 factories , the @xmath26 and the lepton energy distributions </S>",
    "<S> can be precisely measured and be used to distinguish these form factor parameterizations , and to extract @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of @xmath6 from @xmath70 would represent a powerful method complementary to the determination of @xmath6 from other exclusive decay modes , e.g. , from @xmath71 .    in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we plot the @xmath26 distributions and the lepton energy @xmath72 distributions of the decays @xmath73 , where we have normlized the form factors to give @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both lcsr and lattice qcd predict very consistent lepton energy distributions as well as consistent decay rates for the decays . </S>",
    "<S> integrating out the lepton energy in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , one obtains @xmath75^{\\frac{3}{2}}.\\ ] ] at maximum recoil point @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 as indicated by qcd sum rule calculations @xcite , the value of @xmath78 is rather stable under the variation of @xmath26 when the value of @xmath26 is small . </S>",
    "<S> so the ratios @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be safely extrapolated to few gev@xmath81 to make the phase spaces sizable . </S>",
    "<S> once the ratios are measured , they can be used to extract the form factor @xmath82 and the mixing angle @xmath83 from the above relations .    in the literature </S>",
    "<S> , semileptonic decays @xmath84 have been taken as sources of extracting @xmath85 mixing angle and testing the mixing schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the decays @xmath84 involve strange contents @xmath86 of @xmath87 , and @xmath88 involve non - strange contents @xmath89 of @xmath87 , therefore @xmath88 and @xmath84 could provide combined testing of @xmath85 mixing scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known that @xmath4 and @xmath90 are too complicated objects to be reliably described within qcd yet , it may be very hard to calculate the transition form factors @xmath91 within the frameworks of lattice qcd and qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental extraction of those form factors will improve our theorectical understanding of many interesting nonleptonic @xmath1 decay modes involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and might shed light on the problem , currently under discussion @xcite , of the puzzling large branching ratios of @xmath92 observed by cleo @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note a few experimental comments : background for @xmath70 would be much smaller than that of @xmath93 , due to much lower multiplicity , since the random background caused by @xmath94 is about an order of magnitude smaller than that by @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of @xmath96 in experimental analyses may be much easier than @xmath97 , even though the signal / noise ratio is worse , because the mass of @xmath4 is much bigger than that of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> and we could even require the momentum of @xmath4 to be bigger than 1 gev to remove combinatorial backgrounds substantially .    to conclude , we studied semileptonic decays @xmath0 , which can be used to extract the hadronic form factors of @xmath1 meson decays to @xmath2 and the angle of @xmath3 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratios are found to be @xmath99 . </S>"
