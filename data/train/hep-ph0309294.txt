    "a new narrow resonance has been discovered at mass 3872 mev by the belle collaboration@xcite through the process , @xmath1 following belle@xcite , we denote this resonance tentatively by @xmath2 in this paper .",
    "the invariant mass of @xmath3 extends to the upper end of its kinematical boundary ( @xmath4 775 mev ) , but it is not known at present whether the dipion is in @xmath5-wave , @xmath6-wave , or even @xmath7-wave .",
    "experiment does not exclude the possibility that the dipion in the @xmath8 mass region is actually in @xmath5-wave .",
    "we should keep in mind that the @xmath5-wave @xmath9 scattering cross section rises rapidly starting just below the @xmath8 mass .",
    "in fact , this partial - wave or spin of the dipion provides the most important clue to the quantum numbers of this resonance .",
    "search of the radiative decays @xmath10 has so far not produced a positive result@xcite . as the upper bound set on the raditative decay branching",
    "becomes more severe , it will impose a strong constraint on the nature of the resonance .",
    "the most likely candidate for @xmath2 is an excited charmoniun state .",
    "in fact , the experimental study of the @xmath0 final state in @xmath11 decay was motivated with search of the excited charmonia@xcite . meanwhile",
    ", closeness of the @xmath12 threshold to 3872 mev suggests another explanation , a loosely bound molecular state of @xmath12 and @xmath13@xcite .",
    "however , both the charmonium and the molecule interpretation may encounter some problems . in this paper",
    "we are not rigidly constrained by the potential model predictions on charmonia since uncertainties are large for the excited charmonium states near the open charm thresholds .",
    "we will be open minded about dynamics of the molecules .",
    "instead we narrow down the possible quantum numbers of @xmath2 with the information extracted from the belle experiment and then focus on possibility of determining the quantum numbers purely experimentally by the decay angular distributions and correlations .",
    "the belle experiment@xcite has so far imposed the following constraints on this resonance .",
    "the width is narrow ( @xmath14 2.3 mev@xcite ) despite the ample phase space ( @xmath15 mev ) for the decay @xmath16 . for comparison",
    ", the width of @xmath17 is 24 mev with @xmath18 mev .",
    "provided that the decay into @xmath19 is forbidden by selection rules of quantum numbers rather than by some unknown dynamical suppression , we expect that @xmath2 should have an unnatural spin - parity , @xmath20 or an unnatural spin - charge - parity , @xmath21 to select a right @xmath22 out of these choices , the dipion quantum numbers provide the most important clue .",
    "if @xmath3 forms a scalar dipion of @xmath23 or a tensor dipion of @xmath24 , charge parity @xmath25 of @xmath0 is negative and isospin is @xmath26 or 2 .",
    "we do not consider @xmath27 further in view of lack of any candidate .",
    "combining @xmath3 with @xmath28 in relative orbital angular momentum @xmath29 , one can make the unnatural spin parity and charge - parity states of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 with a scalar or a tensor dipion .",
    "if @xmath3 forms a vector dipion of @xmath33 , charge parity of @xmath0 is positive and isospin is @xmath34 . the most relevant unnatural spin - parity state is @xmath35 with @xmath36 in this case .",
    "these unnatural quantum number states are listed in table i. since only a limited phase space is available for the @xmath0 decay , the table includes only the cases of @xmath37 for the scalar dipion , and @xmath38 for the vector and tensor dipion .",
    "since @xmath26 for the charmonia , the folllowing quantum numbers are selected for charmonium candidates : @xmath39 the charmonia carrying these quantum numbers are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the mass spectrum calculations by potential models@xcite suggest that the @xmath42 state should be much closer to the @xmath43 state , which is believed to be @xmath44 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath45 state was predicted at 30@xmath4660 mev lower than 3872 mev@xcite .",
    "however , the charmonium levels near the @xmath19 and @xmath12 thresholds are subject to large uncertainties due to the open charm channel coupling and the large relativistic corrections ( @xmath47 in one estimate@xcite ) . therefore we are not too concerned with the discrepancy between experiment and the potential model expectation for the masses in the case of those higher excited charmonia .",
    "the radiative decay into @xmath48 is allowed for both @xmath49 and @xmath31 by quantum numbers .",
    "the decay @xmath50 is the @xmath51 transitions and should occur without suppression .",
    "let us compare it with a similar radiative decay of @xmath52 .",
    "we know @xmath53 kev and @xmath54 mev from experiment .",
    "the strong decay @xmath55 occurs into a scalar dipion with @xmath5-wave ( @xmath36 ) relative to @xmath28 .",
    "apart from difference in the dipole strength @xmath56 between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the spin factors and phase space corrections combined enhances @xmath59 by a factor of @xmath60 relative to @xmath61 .",
    "the dipole matrix element is sensitive to the coupling to the @xmath6-wave @xmath12 channel .",
    "comparison of the strong decay is at least as sensitive or even more uncertain since the decay @xmath62 involves @xmath7 wave either in the dipion or in the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the rescaling factor of the three - body phase space can be as large as @xmath63 , which is severely compensated by the @xmath7-wave suppresion factor , @xmath64 for a scalar dipion and @xmath65 for a tensor dipion .",
    "it depends sensitively on the dipion mass distribution . despite the larger phase space for @xmath66 than for @xmath55 ,",
    "the net result is most likely that @xmath67 is smaller than @xmath68 . with this order of magnitude consideration",
    "we expect @xmath69 .",
    "then the non - observation of the radiative decay @xmath70@xcite , @xmath71 poses a problem on the @xmath42 assignment .",
    "the belle collaboration @xcite compares the upper bound of eq.([ub ] ) above with the potential model prediction of 5@xcite . considering the large uncertainties involved in the potential model calculations , however , it is prudent to take a `` wait and see '' attitude .",
    "the other possibility of the radially excited @xmath41 encounters a larger discrepancy with the mass prediction of the potential models .",
    "the mass 3872 mev is roughly 100 mev lower than the potential model .",
    "nonetheless we do not reject @xmath72 at present for the same reason stated above for @xmath45 .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath73 is an @xmath74 transition that is caused by spin flip .",
    "since the spatial wave functions are orthogonal between @xmath75 and @xmath72 in the nonerelativistic limit , the @xmath74 transition is considerably weaker than the allowed @xmath51 transitions .",
    "the strong decay @xmath76 occurs into a scalar dipion with @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the radiative branching fraction is much smaller , relative to the @xmath0 decay branching , for @xmath72 than for @xmath45 .",
    "it can be easily consistent with the current upper bound .",
    "if the non - observation of the radiative decays into @xmath48 continues to a higher precision , we should consider @xmath72 as a better candidate than @xmath45 .",
    "we should keep in mind , however , that even the lowest @xmath80 charmonium @xmath81 has not yet been reported in @xmath11 decay despite continuing searches by both the belle and the babar collaboration .    to wit ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a charmonium , it should be either the @xmath82 state or the @xmath83 state .",
    "the idea of loosely bound molecule states of two hadrons has been entertained for a long time@xcite , but no meson has so far been positively identified as such a state . the close proximity of the mass 3872 mev to the @xmath12 thresholds ( 3971.2 @xmath84 0.7 mev for @xmath85 and 3979.3 @xmath84 0.7 mev for @xmath86 ) has prompted reconsideration of this possibility for @xmath2@xcite : @xmath87",
    "hereafter we refer to the charge - parity eigenstates of the molecule states simply by @xmath12 .",
    "then the following unnatural spin - parity and charge - parity states can be formed as a molecule : @xmath88 since charge parity of @xmath0 is correlated to isospin by @xmath89 , the molecule should be in @xmath26 for @xmath90 and in @xmath34 for @xmath91 .",
    "for the relative orbital angular moementum of @xmath12 , the closeness of 3872 mev to the @xmath12 threshold strongly favors @xmath92 over @xmath93 .",
    "a qualitative argument of dynamics based on the one - pion exchange favors formation of the @xmath26 molecules over the @xmath34 ones , in particular , @xmath94 and @xmath35@xcite .",
    "however , the states of @xmath94 and @xmath35 with @xmath26 are not found in table i since they are inconsistent with the decay into @xmath95 .",
    "is it possible that the states of @xmath94 and @xmath35 with @xmath26 decay into the @xmath34 channels of @xmath0 with isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the answer is affirmative , but such a state can not feed a scalar dipion in @xmath0 because of @xmath25 invariance .",
    "in this case , the dipions observed with mass below the @xmath8 region would be entirely due to the vector dipion produced by isospin breaking .",
    "we do expect a large isospin violation in a molecular bound state of @xmath12 at 3872 mev , since the mass 3872 mev almost coincides with the @xmath96 threshold but as much as 7 mev below the @xmath97 threshold .",
    "no matter how large isospin violation is , however , no single resonance can produce both a scalar dipion and a vector dipion in @xmath0 by @xmath25 invariance : any strong interaction resonance of zero net flavor must be an eigenstate of charge conjugation even when isospin is broken . since the states of @xmath26 and @xmath34 have opposite @xmath25 , a single resonance can not be responsible for both the @xmath26 final state ( a scalar dipion ) and the @xmath34 final state ( a vector dipion ) of @xmath0 . in order to feed both the scalar / tensor and the vector dipion",
    ", there must be two ( almost perfectly degenerate ) resonances of opposite charge parities , one with @xmath26 and odd @xmath25 and the other with @xmath34 and even @xmath25 .",
    "forming two such molecules in degeneracy in hidden flavor channels would be a highly unlikely accident . with these observations",
    ", we should consider only a molecule of either @xmath98 with @xmath26 or @xmath99 with @xmath34 as the molecule candidates among the entries in eq .",
    "( [ molecules ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the branching fractions of the radiative transitions to @xmath48 are naturally small for the @xmath12 molecules in general . for @xmath99 , the radiative transitions into @xmath48",
    "is completely forbidden by @xmath25 invariance .",
    "even for the molecules of @xmath31 , the radiative decay width should be rather small .",
    "hence a small or negligible radiative decay width poses no problem for the interpretation in terms of a molecule .",
    "if @xmath22 of the most attractive channel of @xmath12 coincides with those of a charmonium , a substantial mixing can occur between @xmath12 and the charmonium@xcite .",
    "this is a real possibility for our most favorite charmonium candidates with @xmath100 and @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath2 is such a mixed state of a molecule and a charmonium , its radiative decay width is suppressed relative to that of a pure charmonium by the fraction of the molecule mixing .",
    "in fact , this kind of mixing is needed for a very loosely bound molecule state to be produced in @xmath11 decay with a significant rate@xcite .",
    "the production amplitude of a bound state is proportional to the `` wave function at origin '' @xmath101 for the same reason that the produciton amplitudes of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are proportonal to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , which are interpreted as the wave functons at the origin of quark - antiquark . for a loosely bound state with binding energy @xmath106",
    ", @xmath107 is a small quantity proportional to @xmath108 . for the @xmath12 molecule , this is much smaller than @xmath107 of the charmonia for which the charm quark mass is not sharply defined . if one accepts this argument , production of a pure @xmath12 molecule is minuscule relative to charmonium produciton in @xmath11 decay .",
    "physically speaking , @xmath109 and @xmath110 must fly in parallel with practically zero relative velocities in order to form a molecule in @xmath11 decay .",
    "such a phase space is a tiny , almost negligible fraction of the final - state phase space of @xmath11 decay .",
    "the only way to enhance the molecule production in @xmath11 decay is through a substantial mixing with a charmomium .",
    "molecule , a more favorable environment is near the @xmath12 threshold in @xmath111 annihilation where the relative motion of @xmath109 and @xmath110 is restricted to be small . ]",
    "the most important information in determining the quantum numbers of @xmath2 is the spin of the dipion in @xmath0 .",
    "let us first consider the case that the dipions of @xmath26 are entirely in @xmath5-wave , @xmath23 .",
    "if one recalls that the d - wave @xmath9 cross section is negligibly small in this region , this is a reasonable possibility .",
    "however , it is experiment that should eventually determine whether @xmath112 or not .",
    "if @xmath3 is really a scalar dipion , the @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) momentum in dipion rest frame should show no angular correlation with other vectors ; @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the solid angle of @xmath117 in the dipion rest frame , as measured with respect to the direction of any momentum , e.g. the @xmath28 momentum in the @xmath118 rest frame .",
    "if this test shows that the dipion is indeed a scalar , the dipion angular distribution in the rest frame of @xmath2 happens to be independent of dynamics and unique for @xmath119 and @xmath49 since the zero - helicity amplitude of @xmath28 is forbidden for them .",
    "we elaborate on this below .",
    "the @xmath2 state is produced in the zero - helicity state in the @xmath11 rest frame when it is produced in @xmath120 . in the @xmath118 rest frame",
    ", @xmath2 is in @xmath121 when the quantization axis ( call it the @xmath122-axis ) of @xmath123 is chosen along @xmath124 in the @xmath11 rest frame . according to the parity constraint of the helicity formalism@xcite , the helicity amplitudes @xmath125 for @xmath126 in the @xmath127-rest frame obey @xmath128 where @xmath129 are the instrinsic parities of @xmath130 . in the present case , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "we apply this relation to the case of a scalar dipion , @xmath134 . denoting the helicity of @xmath28 by @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 ,",
    "we obtain from the parity constraint @xmath137 the factor @xmath138 is equal to @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the @xmath142 amplitudes of @xmath28 must vanish : @xmath143 let us suppose that one measures the angular distribution of the dipion momentum @xmath144 in the @xmath118 rest frame , choosing the @xmath122-axis along the @xmath118 momentum in the @xmath145 rest frame .",
    "following the standard formulae@xcite , we obtain with eq .",
    "( [ zero ] ) @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the polar angle of @xmath148 .",
    "( see fig.1 . )    for the positive parity states other than @xmath98 , the longitudinal polarization decay amplitude enters the angular distribution : @xmath149 where @xmath150 with @xmath151 . the angular distribution for @xmath152 can mimic that of @xmath49 when @xmath153 is small .",
    "the zero total helicity state @xmath154 can be produced as well as the nonzero helicity states for the tensor dipion .",
    "that is , more than one value of @xmath29 is allowed for a given @xmath155 of @xmath2 in the case of the tensor dipion .",
    "consequently the angular distributioins and correlations are dependent on dynamics .",
    "however , kinematics of the @xmath2 decay allow us to make a special approximation .",
    "since the tensor dipion mass is produced with the invariant mass close to the upper end of the kinematical boundary ( @xmath156 mev ) , the dipion and @xmath28 are most often produced nearly at rest in the @xmath118 rest frame .",
    "let us select those fat dipions .",
    "we then expect that the relative orbital angular momentum between the dipion and @xmath28 is in s - wave ( @xmath36 ) and that the nonrelativistic approximation should be good . therefore , first of all , the angular distribution of the tensor dipion momentum should be flat in the @xmath118 rest frame : @xmath157 where the sign of @xmath4 means `` in the nonrelativistic approximation '' .",
    "this may not be an easy test since the fat dipions do not move much in the @xmath118 rest frame so that determination of the @xmath148 direction is subject to large errors .",
    "( [ flat ] ) only tests @xmath36 , not directly the quantum numbers of the dipion .",
    "we shall be able to test the tensor nature of dipion by measuring the angular correlation of @xmath158 of the dipion rest frame with the @xmath118 momentum in the @xmath145 rest frame .",
    "since angular momenta conservation holds among spins alone for @xmath36 , the spin components of @xmath3 and @xmath28 make up @xmath159 of @xmath2 as @xmath160 when the spin quantization axis is chosen along the @xmath118 momentum in the @xmath145 rest frame .",
    "the @xmath161 states are missing in the right - hand of eq .",
    "( [ cg ] ) , which is characteristic of the clebsch - gordan composition involving @xmath162 .",
    "this leads to the angular distribution of @xmath163 as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the polar angle of @xmath166 in the dipion rest frame as measured from the @xmath118 momentum in the @xmath11 rest frame .",
    "( [ ac1 ] ) can be obtained by an elementary calculation of the nonrelativistic decay amplitude made of three polarizations , @xmath167",
    ". the test will be done most accurately if one selects the dipions of 700 mev @xmath168 775 mev .",
    "the belle data show many events in this mass region relative to the region below it@xcite .      the spin parity of interest in the case of the vector dipion is @xmath99 for the molecule .",
    "the vector dipion most often forms a @xmath8 meson .",
    "since @xmath8 and @xmath28 are nearly at rest in the x rest frame , the relative orbital angular momentum between them should be @xmath36 just as in the case of the tensor dipion . in this circumstance",
    "the same simplification occurs .",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath148 tests @xmath36 by eq .",
    "( [ flat ] ) .",
    "the vector nature of the dipion can be tested by the angular correlation , @xmath169 where @xmath165 is defined in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ ac1 ] ) .",
    "the most likely candidate for the narrow resonance discovered by the belle collaboration is the @xmath45 charmonium state . depending on the outcome of the radiative decay measurement , however",
    ", the @xmath72 charmonium may become a better alternative . among the molecules , the @xmath170 molecule states of @xmath171 are acceptable as far as quantum numbers are concerned and",
    "furthermore would easily satisfy the constraints imposed by the absence of radiative decay mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the final states of @xmath0 with a scalar dipion and a vector dipion can not be produced by a single resonance because of charge conjugation invariance no matter how badly isospin symmetry is violated .",
    "the crucial information leading to determination of the quantum numbers of this resonance should come from spin of the dipion .",
    "the various angular distributions and correlations that have been presented here will help us in identifying the nature of this resonant state conclusively .",
