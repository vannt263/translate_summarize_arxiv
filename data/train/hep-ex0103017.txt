    "hadron production in high energy neutrino - nucleon charged current ( cc ) interactions can be represented as a two - step process .",
    "the first step is the interaction of a w boson with a quark of the target nucleon changing it into a quark of a different flavour .",
    "the second step is the hadronization of the quarks during which coloured partons fragment into colourless hadrons .",
    "perturbative qcd not being applicable to the soft process of hadronization , phenomenological models must be used .",
    "the most successful models are the string @xcite and cluster fragmentation @xcite models .",
    "+ a significant fraction of the particles in the hadron jets directly observed are produced through the production and decay of a large variety of very short lived particles , the so - called resonances .",
    "consequently , the study of inclusive meson and baryon resonances is believed to reveal more directly the primary interaction mechanism than the studies of stable particles ( such as pions and kaons ) .",
    "therefore , resonance production provides a better ground for comparisons between models and experimental results .",
    "inclusive resonance production has been extensively studied in @xmath5 annihilation @xcite , photoproduction @xcite , electroproduction by muons @xcite , in hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "+ the role of the orbitally excited mesons , for example @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is of special interest in view of the possibly different production mechanisms .",
    "both mesons have an orbital angular momentum equal to 1 and a sum of spins of the valence quarks also equal to 1 resulting in a total spin of 0 for the @xmath1 and of 2 for the @xmath2 .",
    "+ a number of nonstandard interpretations of the @xmath1 state have been suggested .",
    "one approach regards the @xmath3 as a four quark bound state @xcite , another as a two - kaon molecule @xcite .",
    "gribov @xcite has proposed a new theory of qcd confinement , in which the @xmath3 plays the special role of a novel vacuum scalar state .",
    "close et al .",
    "@xcite noticed that the signature of gribov s vacuum scalar state would be an enhanced yield in low multiplicity events .",
    "robson @xcite proposed an interpretation of the @xmath3 as a scalar glueball .",
    "a recent opal study of the @xmath3 at lep @xcite does not confirm the gribov interpretation .",
    "all measured characteristics of @xmath3 production in @xmath8 decays are consistent with the @xmath3 being a conventional scalar meson . however , an analysis of the wa102 data by close and kirk @xcite selects the enigmatic @xmath3 as a glueball candidate together with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "+ bubble chambers used to be the only detectors where inclusive production of @xmath12 and other resonances in neutrino interactions could be studied . in such detectors detailed information about the final state particles in each event can be obtained .",
    "the neutrino experiments @xcite studied inclusive production of @xmath0 and , in some cases , of @xmath4 resonances . bebc wa59",
    "@xcite studied @xmath13 ( all three charge states ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath4 .",
    "the resonance production properties were measured as a function of the mass of the hadronic system , of the charged hadron multiplicity and of various other kinematical variables .",
    "+ the main problem common to these studies was the small statistics ( the total of all experiments amounts to about 60000 @xmath16 events ) .",
    "the level of accuracy corresponding to this statistics did not necessitate taking into account the reflections of other resonances ( for the definition of reflections see section  [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    "they were not accounted for in most of the previous neutrino experiments .",
    "due to low statistics there were no attempts to look for the @xmath3 meson in neutrino data .",
    "as to the other orbitally excited meson , bebc wa21 @xcite using 17750 @xmath17 interactions found 615@xmath18226 @xmath4 mesons .",
    "but later , in the combined wa21 + wa25 + wa59 + e180 @xcite data sample ( 58866 @xmath16 events ) , no observation of @xmath4 was reported .",
    "+ all previous experiments reported an overestimation of the average multiplicities of @xmath0 by the lund model by 50 - 70% , while the shapes of the lund distributions were in agreement with the experimental distributions .",
    "+ the nomad experiment in 4 years of data taking ( 1995 - 1998 ) has collected about @xmath19 interactions .",
    "in addition , a short antineutrino run has provided about 32000 @xmath20 events .",
    "the large statistics of the nomad data and the good quality of the event reconstruction make possible the study of processes that could not be studied in previous neutrino experiments .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : section  [ sec : setup ] describes the experimental setup including the nomad detector , the neutrino beam and the nomad simulation software ; in section  [ sec : vardef ] the kinematical variables used in this analysis are defined ; section  [ sec : selection ] and section  [ sec : fit ] describe the details of the analysis ; the results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : analysis ] ; section  [ sec : systematics ] is devoted to the systematic uncertainties ; the multiplicities measured in this analysis are compared with the results of previous experiments in section  [ sec : compprev ] ; summary and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the nomad detector ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nomad_detector ] ) has been described in details elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it consists of a number of sub - detectors most of which are located inside a 0.4 @xmath21 dipole magnet with an inner volume of 7.5@xmath223.5@xmath223.5 m@xmath23 : an active target made of drift chambers ( dc ) @xcite with a mass of 2.7 tons , an average density of @xmath24 g/@xmath25 and a total length of about one radiation length ( @xmath26 ) , followed by a transition radiation detector ( trd ) @xcite , a preshower detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) consisting of 875 lead glass cells @xcite .",
    "the low density and the good instrumentation of the active target ( there is less than 1% of a radiation length between two consecutive measurements ) allow to obtain detailed information about the final state of neutrino interactions .",
    "the momentum resolution for reconstructed tracks is , on average , 3.5% for momenta below 20",

    "the preshower detector is used for electron and gamma identification . + a hadron calorimeter is located just after the magnet coil .",
    "it is followed by an iron absorber and a set of muon chambers .",
    "the muon identification efficiency is 97% for muons of momentum higher than 5 gev / c .",
    "+ the neutrino interaction trigger @xcite consists of a coincidence between signals from two planes of counters located after the active target in the absence of a signal from a large area system of veto counters located upstream of the nomad detector .",
    "+ the nomad target consists mainly of carbon ( on which about 80% of the @xmath16 interactions",
    "occur ) and of other elements with similar atomic numbers ( mostly oxygen and nitrogen ) .",
    "the nomad detector is located in the wanf neutrino beam line @xcite at cern . in the main focusing mode ( positive focusing )",
    "the beam is an essentially pure @xmath29 beam ( about 93% ) . in negative",

    "the inclusive production of the meson resonance @xmath0 in neutrino - nucleon charged current interactions has been studied with much better statistical accuracy than in previous experiments .",
    "+ we also looked for other resonances decaying to @xmath31 pairs .",
