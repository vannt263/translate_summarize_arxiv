    "in fact , we will prove this result for a fixed finite field extension @xmath33 of @xmath4 , and for subanalytic families of functions instead of for individual subanalytic functions .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    let us start by explaining the real ( globally ) subanalytic and semi - algebraic situation , according to kurdyka @xcite , giving a rough sketch of the main arguments for functions in up to two variables . the one variable case becomes trivial by the mentioned relation between distance and the integral of the derivative once one notes that any globally subanalytic subset of @xmath6 is a finite union of points and open intervals ( compare with @xmath34-minimality ) . for @xmath35 a globally subanalytic function",
    ", kurdyka proves that @xmath14 can be partitioned into finitely many pieces which are @xmath34-minimal cells ( sometimes called cylinders ) , for example of the form @xmath36 or of the form @xmath37 where moreover the `` boundary functions '' @xmath38 and @xmath39 are ( globally ) subanalytic or semi - algebraic and have bounded derivatives .",
    "for such a decomposition in so - called @xmath40-regular cells to exist , it is important that for each piece @xmath41 separately , affine coordinates on @xmath42 are chosen so that @xmath41 has indeed such a nice description ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "using such a decomposition into @xmath40-regular cells and affine coordinates adapted to each cell individually , the lipschitz continuity result follows using a path integral of the derivative of @xmath24 along a well chosen path inside the cell , after noticing that any two points in an @xmath40-regular cell can be connected by a path whose length is not much bigger than the distance between the two points it connects .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    over @xmath4 , it seems not possible to follow a strategy similar to kurdyka s , since there is no clear notion of paths connecting two points , let alone of the length of a path , which are basic ingredients for kurdyka s approach over the reals .",
    "more generally speaking , as far as we know there is no clear connection between integrals and distances between points in @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a new approach had to be devised .",
    "let us sketch this new approach in the one and the two variable case .",
    "let @xmath43 be a subanalytic function ( globally subanalytic , as always in this paper ) which is locally lipschitz continuous with constant @xmath1 .",
    "we know that we can partition @xmath14 into finitely many @xmath3-adic cells , all of which are very roughly of a form similar to @xmath44 with constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and where @xmath48 is the set of all @xmath3-adic numbers of the form @xmath49 for some @xmath50 and some @xmath51 ( see [ def::cell ] and [ thm : celldecomp ] for precise statements ) .",
    "we call @xmath52 the center of @xmath41 ( note that @xmath52 may lie outside @xmath41 , which happens precisely when @xmath53 ) .",
    "we define the balls of the cell @xmath41 as the collection of maximal balls ( with respect to inclusion ) contained in @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "[ ballcell ] ) .",
    "it then follows from a certain jacobian property [ jacprop ] that we can select the cells @xmath41 in such a way that each ball of @xmath41 is mapped to either a point or a ball under @xmath15 .",
    "we refine this jacobian property so that we can ensure that the images of the balls of @xmath41 form up to a single cell which has moreover as collection of maximal balls precisely the collection of the images of the maximal balls in @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "proposition [ celcel ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 is a cell with a certain center @xmath55 .",
    "then , roughly , distances between points in @xmath41 are compared to distances to @xmath52 and similarly in the range of @xmath15 , using the center @xmath55 . a calculation based on this comparison of distances and",
    "the jacobian property then finishes the one variable case .",
    "actually , these arguments also show that the analogue statement for subanalytic _ families _ of functions @xmath56 ( instead of for individual subanalytic functions ) holds .",
    "such families are used in the several variable case for the induction argument .    in the two variables case",
    ", we obtain a result vaguely reminiscent of real partitions into @xmath40-regular cells .",
    "let @xmath57 be locally lipschitz continuous with some constant @xmath1 .",
    "roughly , we partition the family @xmath58 into finitely many families of cells @xmath59 with center @xmath52 and boundaries @xmath38 and @xmath39 now depending on @xmath60 .",
    "we show that , after possibly switching the role of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we can ensure that the center @xmath52 is lipschitz continuous in @xmath60 ( see proposition [ lipcenter ] ) . by a piecewise bi - lipschitz transformation",
    ", we may then assume that the center is identically zero for each of the cells .",
    "this is already an important reduction , but the obstacles due to the lack of a good notion of paths and integrals to control distances remain . instead of working with paths as is done in the real case , we work with a finite sequence of points with given starting point and endpoint , and one could understand such a finite sequence of jumps from one point to the next as a @xmath3-adic analogue of a real `` path '' .",
    "for such a sequence of jumps to be of use , the following is required : after each jump , one should still stay in the same cell so that one can still evaluate the function @xmath15 , the total ( cumulative ) distance of the jumps should be comparable to the distance between the starting point and the endpoint , and the function should not vary too much at each jump so that one can control @xmath62 for any jump from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in the sequence .",
    "this is done in the two variable case as follows .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath65 be given in @xmath41 .",
    "either @xmath66 has bounded derivative , and then we can use induction for the one - variable function @xmath67 and roughly jump from @xmath63 to @xmath68 , then to @xmath69 and finally to @xmath65 . in the at first sight more difficult case where @xmath66 has large derivative , we invert the role of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the parametrization of the function @xmath70 , namely , we essentially work with the one - variable function @xmath71 and use induction for this function and then roughly make similar jumps as before : from @xmath63 to @xmath72 , then to @xmath73 and finally to @xmath65 , for some @xmath74 .",
    "this `` path '' allow us to bound @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 as needed for lipschitz continuity , uniformly in @xmath63 and @xmath65 in the cell .",
    "of course , some fine tuning is required in order to guarantee injectivity before one starts inverting functions like @xmath38 , which is provided e.g. by corollary [ inj - cons ] .",
    "as already indicated , the bulk of the paper is concerned with a fixed finite field extension @xmath33 of @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude the paper by extending our main theorem to elementary extensions of @xmath33 , see proposition [ ext ] .",
