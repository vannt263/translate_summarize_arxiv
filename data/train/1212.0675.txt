    "bubble clustering in pseudo - turbulence has attracted much attention because of its importance in applications , and lack of understanding of the fundamental physics ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have conducted numerical simulations and found that deformability of the bubbles plays an important role in the clustering phenomenon : bubbles with small deformability ( spherical bubbles ) show a horizontal alignment , while deformed bubbles display a preferential clustering in the vertical direction .",
    "meanwhile , experiments have found both horizontal and vertical clustering depending on parameters like bubble deformation , size , and other flow properties ( @xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "we revisit the issue of bubble clustering , using a vorono analysis technique , which has been proven to be a powerful tool for quantifying the clustering behavior of bubbles and particles in fluid flow , see e.g. @xcite , or @xcite . here , we extend the vorono analysis to study the geometric morphology of the clusters formed by freely rising deformable bubbles .",

    "every point inside a vorono cell is the nearest to the particle location compared to the neighbors ; the exceptions being borderlines , vertices , and facets , which have the same distance between two or more particles . in a given three - dimensional distribution of particles ,",

    "there are two specific issues that are addressed below .",
    "first , the vorono cells of particles located near the edges of the domain are not well - defined , i.e. the vorono cells either do not close or close at points outside of the domain .",
    "these vorono cells located near the domain edges are usually discarded from the vorono analysis ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the present data , the number of bubbles in the domain are small . in this case",
    ", we can not afford to ignore the edge cells , as it will result in poor statistics .",
    "we take advantage of the periodic boundary condition of the numerics to overcome this problem .",
    "the periodic boundary condition enables us to form a box ( 3@xmath123@xmath123 larger , and including all particles ) surrounding the original box .",
    "we then apply the three - dimensional vorono tesselation on the particle positions in this larger box .",
    "we can now ignore the cell edges on this larger box , as we have sufficient number of particles for good statistics .",

    "the value @xmath17 decreases with increasing @xmath15.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    secondly , the number of particles available for the vorono analysis is a key parameter that can significantly affect the results ( see fig.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "we check the dependence of the number of particles on the standard deviation of vorono volumes in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](a ) for randomly distributed point - like particles .",
    "we vary the number of particles inside each of the boxes that are replicated to form the larger box as mentioned above .",
    "the vorono tesselations are applied and the standard deviation of vorono volumes for each case of the varying number of particles is shown in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](a ) . also , the standard deviation of vorono volumes is normalized by that of randomly distributed particles with numbers @xmath1310@xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "each error bar has been calculated by repeating this procedure more than 10@xmath18 times .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](a ) that when the particle number is less than 100 , the value of the standard deviation changes quite significantly .",
    "we note the peculiarity that when a box includes just one or two particle(s ) , the vorono volumes are the same or half of the volume of the domain , respectively , and hence the standard deviation is zero . for a larger number of particles , the standard deviation grows with increasing number of particles and shows an asymptotic behavior , and saturates to the value of unity when the particle numbers approach @xmath19 1000 . in previous work ( @xcite )",
    "we have used a value of @xmath20=1 for the vorono analysis as we had 1000 particles in our simulations . in the present work",

    "figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](a ) gives the corresponding value of the standard deviation as @xmath21 = 0.82 .",
    "we account for this change by using @xmath16 = 0.82@xmath22 in the equation which describes the vorono volume pdf fit using the single parameter @xmath9 ( @xcite ) : @xmath23 this equation indeed results in a nice fit as shown in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](b ) , where we plot the vorono volume pdf for 16 randomly distributed particles ( blue upper triangles ) and the curve from equation  ( [ eq : fitting ] ) ( thin black line ) .",

    "table  [ tab : cond ] lists the different parameters used in the numerics .",
    "thus , we need to first understand the effect of finite particle size on the vorono volume distributions .",
    "for this , we artificially generate random positions in three - dimensions ( see   [ sec : simulation ] ) for 16 perfect spheres of diameter @xmath25 and change the domain size @xmath26 to vary the sphere - domain length ratio @xmath15 .",
    "this sphere - domain length ratio @xmath15 is related to the void fraction @xmath27 by the expression : @xmath28 . for clarity of presentation",
    ", we have chosen to describe the clustering results using @xmath15 instead of @xmath27 . in figure",
    "[ fig : randomfiniteeffect](b ) we show the vorono volume pdfs for the 16 randomly distributed spheres at different @xmath15 .",
    "the pdf of the vorono volume for the randomly distributed point - particles and for spheres at the small value of @xmath15 = 0.02 show quite a similar behavior , i.e. the finite - size effect is then negligible .",
    "the finite - size effects become more significant with increasing @xmath15 , and this is seen in the shape of the pdf .",
    "the pdfs become narrower with increasing @xmath15 , implying that the bubbles are distributed more evenly throughout the domain . at a large value of @xmath15 ,",
    "each of the spheres occupy relatively larger volumes in the box , which reduces the available free - space ( for other spheres ) , leading to a more constrained distribution and narrower pdf shape .",
    "the standard deviations of the vorono volume pdfs as a function of @xmath15 are shown in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](c ) .",
    "the values @xmath7 are normalized by the standard deviation obtained from the @xmath2-distribution fit for randomly distributed point particles , @xmath16 .",
    "the indicator @xmath17 decreases monotonically with @xmath15 , starting at 1 ( at @xmath15 = 0 ) and reduces to @xmath191/5 for @xmath29 , clearly indicating the effect of finite - size .",
    "the normalization of the clustering indicator @xmath30 for each case used in the discussion below is carried out at the same bubble - domain length ratio @xmath15 , in order to fully focus on dynamical effects .",
    "the total runtime for numerical simulations is about t=2 s , and the vorono volume time series reveals that the clustering is initially transient and settles to a quasi - steady state after t=1 s. hence , we only consider data after t=1 s from the starting time .",
    "the clustering results are averaged over different snapshots at intervals of t=0.05 s.",
    "three - dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) have been performed to simulate bubbles rising in a swarm , using periodic boundary conditions in all directions to mimic an ` infinite ' swarm without wall effects , similarly to what has been done by @xcite .",
    "the simulations have been carried out using a model that incorporates the front - tracking ( ft ) method ( @xcite ) , which tracks the interfaces of the bubbles explicitly using lagrangian control points distributed homogeneously over the interface .",
    "compared to interface reconstruction techniques , such as volume - of - fluid or level - set methods , the advantage of the ft method is that the bubbles are able to approach each other closely ( within less than the size of 1 grid cell ) and can even collide , while preventing ( artificial ) merging of the interfaces .",
    "therefore , the size of the bubbles remains constant throughout the simulation . especially for bubble swarm simulations with high void fractions as studied in this work , this is an important aspect .",
    "in addition , the interface is sharp allowing the surface tension force to act at the exact position of the interface .",
    "each bubble was tracked individually , using the locations of the control points on the interface to acquire the bubble position ( center of mass ) and bubble shape ( aspect ratio ) , which were stored for further analysis .",
    "the aspect ratio is calculated from the ratio between the major and the minor axis @xmath0 along the cartesian axes : @xmath42 .",
    "note that this procedure neglects diagonal shape deformations , so that strongly deformed bubbles oriented diagonally may be attributed an aspect ratio of @xmath43 ( nearly spherical ) . in this work",
    "we consider bubbles with limited deformability and under mild flow conditions so that these effects can safely be neglected .",

    "is discarded .",
    "the simulation parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : cond ] .",
    "an initial structured configuration of the bubble positions can cause streaming ( @xcite ) and liquid channeling , and may take a significant part of the simulation time to break up into a non - structured configuration . to prevent such initialization effects from influencing our simulation results , the bubble positions were initially set to a non - ordered fashion in the domain . especially at",
    "higher void fractions it is not efficient to subsequently place a bubble randomly in the domain without allowing overlap .",
    "therefore , a monte - carlo simulation procedure has been used to generate the initial positions of the bubbles which works for all void fractions ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , the bubbles are placed as spheres in a structured configuration in the domain in a simple cubic configuration .",
    "depending on the void fraction , the bubbles might overlap with each other .",
    "we now define the potential energy of the system as : @xmath52^n$ ] , with a variable @xmath53 characterizing how steep the potential is .",
    "the position of a bubble @xmath37 is given by @xmath54 and its radius by @xmath55 .",
    "each bubble is now moved by a small amount in a random direction and the potential energy is determined .",
    "a move is accepted whenever the potential energy remains equal or becomes less , whereas a move that increases the potential energy is accepted only if it is smaller than a critical number @xmath56 : @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath58 was set to 50 . in a single iteration , each bubble is allowed 200 ( attempts of ) displacement .",
    "then , the power @xmath53 is gradually increased from an initial value of 6 up to a final value of 100 , and a new iteration starts .",
    "the potential energy of the system as a whole decreases during this process , and when the final state has been reached and the bubbles show no overlap at all , the positions of the bubbles are accepted for use as starting positions in the front tracking model .",
    "additionally , in the initial transient of the front tracking simulations , the bubbles accelerate , deform and move through the domain , which also changes their relative positions .",
    "this start - up stage is discarded from further analysis .",
    "for the random positions of the point - particles as shown in figure  [ fig : randomfiniteeffect](c ) , the same procedure was used , except that we chose the number of allowed displacements for each particle per iteration to be 10@xmath18 .",
