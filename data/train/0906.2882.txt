    "graphene is an atomically thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system composed of carbon atoms on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "several experimental groups have recently  @xcite introduced techniques which enabled isolation and study of systems with one or a small number of graphene layers .",
    "the interesting physics of graphene systems stems from the fact that its envelope - function of low - energy schrdinger equation is equivalent to the massless 2d dirac equation . in the case of graphene",
    "the spinor structure in the dirac equation refers to sublattices of its honeycomb structure and its brillouin - zone valleys , instead of the spin degrees of freedom and the electron - positron picture .",
    "graphene , therefore , presents a new type of many - body problem in which the noninteracting low energy quasiparticle dynamic  @xcite is effectively described by a 2d massless dirac hamiltonian @xmath0 , with two chiral eigenvalues , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , with @xmath3m / sec , is the fermi velocity of carriers .",
    "the chirality plays an important role in the novel electronic properties of graphene .    the strength of interaction effects in an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) increases with decreasing the carrier density .",
    "at low densities , the effective velocity is suppressed , the charge compressibility changes sign from positive to negative , and the spin - susceptibility is strongly enhanced . in the dirac - like electrons in graphene , it has been shown  @xcite that the velocity is enhanced rather than suppressed , and that the compressibility , always remains positive , and the spin - susceptibility is suppressed .",
    "these qualitative differences are due to the exchange interactions between electrons near the fermi surface and electrons in the negative energy sea .",
    "the interband excitations are closely analogous to the virtual particle - antiparticle excitations of a truly relativistic electron gas .",
    "conventional 2deg has been a fertile source of surprising new physics for more than four decades . in recent years , because of the important and novel physical properties found in both theoretical and technological applications , there has been a large amount of theoretical and experimental studies on the effects of parallel magnetic field @xmath4 in a 2deg . a great deal of activity",
    "was spawned in the last decade to understand the apparent metal - insulator transition observed in si - mosfet and gaas based structures.@xcite although the basic mechanism and the existence of a quantum phase transition is still a matter of on - going debate , experiments have amassed a wealth of data on the transport properties of the 2d electron systems in the metallic state .",
    "zhang and das sarma@xcite investigated the ground - state properties of the 2deg in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath4 using random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "they showed that for small wigner - seitz density parameter @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the bohr radius in the medium of interest and in the absence of the magnetic field the system prefers to be in a paramagnetic state .",
    "as @xmath4 increases the ground - state energy is minimized at a special nonzero spin polarization denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the degree of spin polarization is defined as @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is electron density with spin up ( down ) .",
    "when @xmath4 increases to a critical value @xmath10 in which the system is fully spin polarized , there exist two @xmath7 values , smaller and equal to one , where the total energy is minimized .",
    "they have shown that the first order phase transition from paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic takes place .",
    "importantly , beyond the critical field the energy minimum is at @xmath11 and the system is fully spin polarized .",
    "subai and tanatar@xcite , on the other hand , studied the same system by using a parameterized expression for the correlation energy provided by the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations.@xcite they found that the 2deg in the presence of an in - plane magnetic filed @xmath4 ( @xmath12 ) undergoes a first order phase transition to the ferromagnetic state ( bloch ferromagnetism ) in the density regions associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while for @xmath15 their results predicted a continuous phase transition ( stoner ferromagnetism ) .    in an electron gas system the physical observable quantities most directly related to the energy are the compressibility which measures the stiffness of the system against changes in the density of electrons and the spin - susceptibilities . in bulk electronic systems ,",
    "the spin - susceptibility can usually be extracted successfully from total magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "this is , however , likely to be challenging in the case of single - layer graphene . in the 2deg ,",
    "on the other hand , information about the spin - susceptibility can often be extracted from weak - field magneto - transport experiments using a tilted magnetic field to distinguish spin and orbital response .",
    "recently , hwang and das sarma@xcite have shown that the in - plane magnetic field induces graphene magneto - resistance which is negative for intrinsic gapless graphene while for extrinsic gapless graphene , magneto - resistance is a positive value at fields lower than the critical magnetic field and negative above the critical magnetic field .",
    "the effect of in - plane magnetic field on microwave magneto - transport  @xcite in doped graphene is an open problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of in - plane magnetic field on disorder free doped graphene at zero temperature .",
    "these effects are very important and have some novel and unusual properties in comparison to the conventional 2deg .",
    "we have revisited the problem of the compressibility and spin - susceptibilities in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field and find that the charge compressibility exhibits a crossover between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases depending on the carrier density and the gap values . before describing the details of the theory and presenting our results ,",
    "we point out that the most novel electronic properties of graphene which will be discussed here are based on interband interaction and exchange interaction between electrons near the fermi surface in graphene sheets .",

    "eventually , section iv contains the summery and conclusions .",

    "there are two eigenvalues @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spectrum of particle with @xmath20 is the gap energy .",
    "the results of gapless graphene can be obtained by setting @xmath21 . it should be noted that the in - plane magnetic field couples not only to the spin degrees of freedom in a quasi 2deg which leads to the spin polarization of the carriers , but also to the orbital motion of the carriers  @xcite due to the finite quantum well thickness .",
    "however , because of the absence of thickness in graphene , the applied @xmath4 couples only with spin of the carriers and leads to the spin polarization of them . due to the zeeman spin - splitting effect",
    "we have a shift in the fermi wave vector for up and down spins @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unpolarized fermi wave vector , @xmath24 is the 2d electron density and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the spin and valley degeneracy , respectively .",

    "this particular feature is in contrast to the 2deg in which the reduction of carrier density leads to the decline of the critical field.@xcite this distinguished behavior is a direct result of the chirality in the massless dirac fermions and interband interaction features .",
    "the critical fields , on the other hand , have a non monotonic behavior at small gap values .",
    "it increases by decreasing the density till it reaches to the maximum value and then decreases at very low density values because of the competition between the exchange and correlation energy contributions , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have found that @xmath10 vanishes at about @xmath64 @xmath65 for @xmath57 mev .",

    "the hartree - fock exchange contribution to the ground - state energy is positive . in our work",
    "we clearly show that the rpa correlation energy is negative .",
    "furthermore , it is shown  @xcite that the kinetic energy enhancement of the spin - polarization phase nearly cancels the exchange enhancement and the correlation energy plays a dominant residual role .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the correlation energy suppresses the spin - polarized phase found in the exchange only calculation in gapless graphene . in examining the tendency of the system to develop magnetic order in the presence of electron - electron interactions",

    "the system remains in the ferromagnetic phase .",

    "@xcite clearly there is no longer jump in the magnetization at @xmath73 due to a continuous - phase transition in graphene . in the conventional 2deg",
    ", the transition to the ferromagnetic state near the critical magnetic field value happens with a discrete jump in the polarization indicating a first order transition to the fully polarized state .",
    "the magnetization @xmath7 is a semi - linear function of the magnetic field versus the large gap values .",

    "we found that at the given @xmath81 which is associated with a special density , @xmath79 starts from @xmath60 and slowly tends to the paramagnetic results of the gapless one .",
    "this special behavior is a consequence of the fact that @xmath82 is smaller than @xmath81 as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "however at gapped graphene , say @xmath57 , we chose a value of the critical magnetic field @xmath83 and observed that @xmath79 switches to its fully polarized system value with a kink - like behavior as shown in the fig .  6 .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the fact that @xmath84 is larger than @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that in the compressibility measurements the effect of the polarizing magnetic filed could be discerned .",
    "the physical reason for having two different behaviors at small and large @xmath46 is that the critical magnetic field behaves in different ways at small and large energy gap values .",
    "note that at very large gap energy , @xmath79 decreases by increasing @xmath85 .",

    "in summary , we study the effects of in - plane magnetic field on the ground state properties of both gapless and gapped graphene where the conduction band is partially occupied .",
    "the present work is demonstrative the increasing behavior of the critical field in which the system becomes fully spin polarized by decreasing the density for gapless graphene .",
    "accordingly , it means that there is no longer a spontaneous para - to- ferromagnetic phase transition for gapless graphene at zero - magnetic field .",
    "the critical magnetic field decreases by decreasing the density at large gap values .",
    "quite interestingly , we find a continuous quantum magnetic phase transition for the whole range of the density at zero temperature .",
    "the novel in - plane magnetic field dependence of charge and spin susceptibilities are obtained .",
    "the inverse compressibility as a function of inverse density exhibits a crossover from the fully polarized state to the paramagnetic case for gapless graphene , which should be identifiable experimentally .",
    "mev as a function of inverse square root of density ( in units of 10@xmath86 cm ) for both fully spin polarized and unpolarized states.,width=283 ]    it is worth noticing that the aforementioned results are in contrast to those results calculated for a conventional 2deg due to the effect of interband interaction .",
    "we suggest these results should be verified by experiments .",
    "it is recently shown that ripples in graphene induced a gauge field .",
    "it is convenient to emphasize that the study of the effects of parallel magnetic field on physical quantities in graphene sheets at the presence of such an induced gauge filed is an interesting problem which might be taken into account .",
