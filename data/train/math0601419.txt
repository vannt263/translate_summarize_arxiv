    "in fact the vacuum condition can be removed if @xmath6 is non - twisting ; we will discuss this further in section [ confvac ] .",

    "note that this is a tensor equation since the difference between two connections is a tensor .",

    "one can associate a second - order ode to a projective structure by picking a connection in the equivalence class , choosing local coordinates @xmath142 say , and eliminating the parameter from the geodesic equations .",
    "the resulting equation determines the geodesics in terms of the local coordinates , without the parameter .",
    "the equation is as follows :    [ eqnwithgammas ] = ^x_yy ( ) ^3 + ( 2 ^x_xy - ^y_yy ) ( ) ^2 + ( ^x_xx - 2 ^y_xy ) - ^y_xx .",
    "a general projective structure is therefore defined by a second - order ode ( [ secondorderode ] ) .",
    "in fact , two of the four functions @xmath30 can be eliminated by a coordinate transformation @xmath143 which introduces two arbitrary functions .",
    "on @xmath144 , the horizontal lifts of @xmath145 are defined by @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 are the fibre coordinates of @xmath144 . the geodesics on @xmath11 lift to integral curves of the following spray on @xmath144 : @xmath149 now @xmath150 is homogeneous of degree 1 in the @xmath147 , so it projects to a section of a one dimensional distribution on @xmath151 .",

    "then the spray has the form @xmath160 there is a unique curve in any direction through a point in @xmath11 , which is why the curves can be lifted to a foliation of the projective tangent bundle @xmath161 .    to obtain ( [ connectiondifference ] ) we argue as follows",

    "this gives @xmath165 from which ( [ connectiondifference ] ) follows , using the fact that the connections are torsion - free ( i.e. symmetric in their lower indices ) .",
    "now suppose we have a _ holomorphic _ projective structure on a local patch of @xmath166 , which we still denote @xmath11 .",
    "all of the above is still valid , with real coordinates replaced by complex ones .",
    "the functions @xmath167 are now required to be holomorphic functions of the coordinates . given a real - analytic projective structure",
    ", one can complexify by analytic continuation to obtain a holomorphic projective structure that will come equipped with a _ reality structure _ ( see below ) .",
    "the space @xmath151 is obtained from @xmath144 on quotienting by @xmath168 , which defines a tautological line bundle @xmath169 over @xmath151 .",
    "as the @xmath170 are weight zero in the @xmath171 coordinates , they push down to vector fields on @xmath151 , giving a two - dimensional distribution @xmath172 .",
    "since @xmath150 is weight one in the @xmath171 , one must divide by a homogeneous polynomial of degree one in the @xmath171 to get something that pushes down to a vector field on @xmath151 .",
    "the resulting vector field will have a singularity at a single point on each fibre , where the degree one polynomial vanishes .",
    "different choices of polynomial will result in different vector fields on @xmath151 , but they will always be in the same direction .",
    "in other words , @xmath150 defines a one dimensional distribution which we shall call @xmath173 .",
    "restricting to a @xmath156 fibre , @xmath173 defines a line bundle over @xmath156 .",
    "a section of this line bundle corresponds to a vector field in @xmath173 , i.e. a choice of polynomial as described above , and has a pole at a single point .",
    "therefore by the classification of holomorphic line bundles over @xmath156 , it must be @xmath169 .    restricting to a @xmath156 fibre ,",
    "one obtains the following exact sequence of vector bundles over @xmath156 @xmath174 where the first bundle is @xmath173 , the second is @xmath172 , and the last is the quotient .",
    "in fact , the quotient is @xmath175 , for the following reason .",
    "consider for instance the push down of @xmath176 to @xmath151 .",
    "this defines a subbundle of @xmath172 that is different to @xmath150 everywhere except at a single point , the image of @xmath177 .",
    "hence it determines a section of @xmath178 which vanishes at a single point .",
    "therefore , again using the classification of holomorphic line bundles over @xmath156 , we have @xmath179 .",
    "the twistor space @xmath15 is the two dimensional quotient of @xmath151 by @xmath173 .",

    "the normal bundle of an embedded @xmath183 is given by the quotient bundle in the above sequence , i.e. @xmath175 .",
    "this is summarized by a double fibration picture : @xmath184 the left arrow denotes projection to @xmath11 , and the right arrow denotes the quotient by @xmath173 .",
    "the converse is also valid :    @xcite [ hitchin_lebrun ] there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between local two dimensional holomorphic projective structures and complex surfaces containing an embedded @xmath156 with normal bundle @xmath175 .",

    "it turns out that a second order ode must be of the form ( [ secondorderode ] ) to be flat , and in addition the functions @xmath191 must satisfy some pdes . defining @xmath192 the following must hold @xcite :    [ flatprojstructure ] f_11 - 4f_01-f_1f_11 + 4f_1f_01 - 3f_0f_11 + 6f_00=0 , where @xmath193 this is a set of pdes for the functions @xmath191 .",
    "a reality structure for @xmath15 is an anti - holomorphic involution that leaves invariant a two real parameter family of twistor lines , and fixes an equator of each line . given a line in this real family , all the sections pointing to nearby lines in the real family have a zero at some point , and the union of these points gives an equator of the line ; this equator must be fixed by the reality structure .",
    "the real family of twistor lines then corresponds to a real manifold @xmath11 with a projective structure .    in this paper",
