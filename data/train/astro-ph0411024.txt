    "in the past seven years , tremendous progress in understanding the cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been achieved from the detections of long - lived grb embers ( or afterglows ) in low frequency bands ( for reviews see van paradijs , kouveliotou , & wijers 2000 ; cheng & lu 2001 ;  2002 ; zhang &  2004 ; piran 2004 ) .",
    "the simple standard shock model (  & rees 1997 ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) responsible for the afterglow has been successfully established ( wijers , , & rees 1997 ; vietri 1997 ; waxman 1997 ; galama et al .",
    "1998 ) .    as more and more afterglows",
    "being detected , the energetics of grb remnants and shock microphysics have been inferred within the context of the standard model . although the standard model are in rough agreement with afterglow observations , problems still exist since the standard scenario is oversimplified at least in two aspects .",
    "first , in the standard afterglow model the relativistic shock is usually assumed to be quasi - adiabatic",
    ". however , the shock in fact may be partially radiative .",
    "fittings to observed afterglows reveal that the shock imparts an equipartition amount of energy into electrons , which is responsible for both the afterglow emission and the shock energy loss ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 , 2002 ) . the temporal evolution of the shock energy would affect the estimation of the grb energetics from late time afterglows , as well as the profiles of afterglow light curves ( lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ; bttcher & dermer 2000 ) .",
    "second , multi - wavelength fittings to several afterglows also indicate that post - shock energy density imparted to electrons is statistically much larger than that of the magnetic fields ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "it implies that the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering plays an important role in grb afterglows .",
    "the ic scattering has two effects .",
    "one is to enhance the cooling rate of the shock - accelerated electrons and hence delay the transition from early fast - cooling phase to late slow - cooling phase .",
    "it finally influences the observed flux density .",
    "another effect is to cause a high energy spectral component typically above the soft x - ray band .",
    "these ic effects have been taken into account by numerous authors ( waxman 1997 ; wei & lu 1998 , 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; dermer , bttcher , & chiang 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ; bjrnsson 2001 ; wang , dai , & lu 2001 ; zhang &  2001 ; li , dai , & lu 2002 ) .    as for the circum - burst environment , in the standard model it is once assumed that the surroundings of grbs are homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "over the past several years , a lot of evidence has been collected linking grbs to the core collapse of massive stars ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "the most important evidence came from the direct association between grb @xmath13 and the supernova sn @xmath14dh ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ) , as well as the previous tentative association between grb @xmath15 and sn @xmath16bw ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ; galama et al .",
    "these associated supernovae have been confirmed to be type ib / c sne .",
    "the progenitors of type ib / c sne are commonly recognized as massive wolf - rayet stars . during their whole life ,",
    "the massive progenitors eject their envelope material into their surroundings through line pressure and thus the stellar wind environments are formed .",
    "this means that the circum - burst medium for grb afterglows may be the stellar wind ( dai & lu 1998 ; , rees , & wijers 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 , 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the afterglow properties of realistic grb shocks , considering the effect of energy losses .",
    "the circum - burst environment is assumed to be either the ism - type or the stellar wind type .",
    "we present an analytical solution for the realistic blast wave during the fast - cooling phase of grb afterglows in  [ sec : fastcooling ] .",
    "this semi - radiative hydrodynamics is applied to the late slow - cooling phase with quite reasonable argument in  [ sec : slowcooling ] .",
    "constraints on the ic components in the soft x - ray afterglows are given in both sections . in  [ sec : lightcurves ] we illustrate typical analytical light curves for the realistic model in detail .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the realistic model for grb remnants has been extensively investigated in the past few years ( huang , dai , & lu 1999 ; huang et al .",
    "it has been shown that this model is correct for both adiabatic and radiative fireballs , and in both ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic phases .",
    "the basic hydrodynamic equation of this model can be derived as follows . in the fixed frame ,",
    "which is rest to the circum - burst environment , the total kinetic energy of the fireball is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lorentz factor of the blast wave , @xmath19 is the initial mass of the blast wave ejected from the central engine , @xmath20 is the mass of the swept - up ambient medium , @xmath21 is the speed of light , and @xmath22 is the total radiation efficiency ( huang et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the comoving frame of the blast wave ,",
    "the total internal energy instantaneously heated by the shock is @xmath23 , which is implied from the relativistic jump conditions ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .",
    "the differential loss of the kinetic energy @xmath24 , when the blast wave sweeps up an infinitesimal mass @xmath25 , can be formulated as @xmath26=-\\epsilon\\gamma(\\gamma-1)\\rm{d}\\textit{m}_{\\rm{sw}}\\textit{c}^{2}.\\ ] ] assuming a constant @xmath22 and inserting the expression for @xmath27 , it is then easy to obtain the hydrodynamic equation of the realistic model ( huang et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) @xmath28 feng et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have relaxed the assumption of a constant @xmath22 , and found that the results differ little from the above equation .",
    "as we show later , the epoch for a constant radiation efficiency will not end just at the transition from the fast cooling phase to the slow cooling phase of the fireball evolution .",
    "in fact , it would last for a time much longer than that transition time , because the radiation efficiency of the shock - accelerated electrons in the slow cooling phase decreases very slowly for typical values of the index of electron energy distribution , e.g. @xmath29 indicated both from observations of the afterglow spectra , and from the shock acceleration theory ( achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "throughout this paper , we focus on the early epoch when the afterglow of a relativistic jet is spherical - like , which requires the lorentz factor of the jet ( @xmath18 ) being larger than the inverse of the half - opening angle .",
    "the swept - up mass is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the proton mass , and the ambient density is @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 for the ism case , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xmath37 for the stellar wind case .",
    "such a blast wave begins to decelerate at the radius @xmath38 , when the swept - up mass reaches @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the initial lorentz factor .",
    "the corresponding decelerating time measured by an observer is @xmath41 , here @xmath42 is the cosmological redshift of the grb .",
    "we neglect the effect of reverse shocks in the early afterglow for simplicity .    at early times , electrons cool rapidly .",
    "the blast wave is therefore semi - radiative with a constant radiation efficiency @xmath2",
    ". the typical energy equipartition factor of electrons is @xmath43 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : hydro ] ) can then be analytically integrated by neglecting the first two terms in the denominator at the right side when @xmath44 .",
    "the scaling laws for the hydrodynamics are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the hydrodynamic self - similarity index @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the observed time since the burst .",
    "the @xmath22 term in the denominator in equation ( [ eqn : m ] ) shows the deviation of the hydrodynamics of a semi - radiative blast wave from that of an adiabatic one of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) .",
    "since the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath50 , it decreases as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the initial isotropic energy at @xmath38 .",

    "the maximum lorentz factor of the shock - accelerated electrons , @xmath58 , is obtained by assuming that the acceleration timescale , which is typically the gyration period in the magnetic field , equals the hydrodynamical timescale .",
    "the cooling lorentz factor of electrons is determined by considering both synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering , i.e. ( sari et al . 1998 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) @xmath59 } , \\label{eqn : fc : gc}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the thomson cross section , and the compton parameter @xmath61 is a constant during the fast cooling phase ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",

    "although the flattening of the optical / x - ray light curve around @xmath62 predicted in the inverse compton dominated cooling regime in the stellar wind case is more obvious than in the ism case , the change of the temporal decaying index is only @xmath326 for the former case . the detailed theoretical optical light curves taking into account the equal arrival time surface effect and the large error bars in x - ray afterglow observations prevent us from the identifications of such flattening .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated analytically the grb afterglow hydrodynamics and constructed the semi - radiative light curves realistically .",
    "we focus on the case that the electron cooling is in the inverse compton dominated regime , i.e. @xmath65 or @xmath327 .",
    "the realistic hydrodynamics is applicable for spherical blast waves with the assumption that the electron energy equipartition factor @xmath0 is not much larger than @xmath328 , which seems to be reasonable based on theoretical expectations and observations as well . in fact , the analytical solution for afterglow hydrodynamics is almost tenable throughout the relativistic stage when @xmath329 ( see equation [ eqn : hydro ] ) .",
    "the only uncertainty is the actual evolution of the radiation efficiency in the late slow - cooling phase .",
    "given @xmath330 , we conclude that a constant radiation efficiency is a good approximation for a fairly long time in the slow - cooling phase .",
    "the transition from fast - cooling to slow - cooling happens much later in the ic dominated cooling regime than in the purely synchrotron cooling regime .",
    "since the actual radiation efficiency decreases very slowly in the slow - cooling phase , the semi - radiative epoch is further prolonged typically by two orders of magnitude in time , other than the whole fast - cooling phase as commonly used . as the grb ejecta sweeps up more and more external medium , the lorentz factor @xmath18 of the shock decreases .",
    "when @xmath18 equals the inverse of the initial half - opening angle @xmath331 of the grb conical ejecta , or jet , the following afterglow light curves deviate from the previously spherical - like ones , and the light curves in this paper are not suitable at this late stage .",
    "generally , our semi - radiative afterglow light curves hold true when the shock is relativistic after the initial deceleration time and before the jet - like stage , with the radiation efficiency satisfying @xmath332max@xmath333 .",
    "the adiabatic afterglow light curves in the synchrotron dominated cooling regime have been well studied in previous works ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; granot & sari 2002 ) .",
    "sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have considered the light curves of a fully radiative ( @xmath334 ) blast wave .",
    "however , our analytical results can not be directly applied to this case .",
    "actually , in the fully radiative case , equation ( [ eqn : hydro ] ) can also be directly integrated and the hydrodynamics and the resulting light curves are the same as derived by sari et al .",
    "the radiative corrections to the afterglow light curves in the wind model have been discussed by chevalier & li ( 2000 ) .",
    "they had adopted the scaling laws of a semi - radiative shock given by bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) .",
    "the temporal exponents of the hydrodynamics and light curves in bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) differ from ours .",
    "in fact , the radiation corrections for these exponents in their work are smaller than that in our work .",
    "cohen , piran & sari ( 1998 ) had studied the hydrodynamics of a semi - radiative relativistic blast wave considering a more complicated post - shock material distribution ( similar to blandford & mckee 1976 ) than that of the simple thin - shell approximation as in our work .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic evolution differs in all these three treatments of cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) and this paper .",
    "the hydrodynamic self - similarity index @xmath335 we obtain lies between the other two s . despite the difference between the hydrodynamics due to",
    "different approximations / treatments , we can see that the radiative corrections to afterglow light curves are significant .",
    "for example , the temporal decaying index of x - ray afterglows at around @xmath178 hours since the main bursts varies in the range of @xmath336 in the ism case , and @xmath337 in the stellar wind case for @xmath291 and @xmath338 , provided that the ic component is neglected . this range is consistent with the observations ( berger , kulkarni & frail 2003 ) . in observations ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 and @xmath5 can be inferred for a particular x - ray afterglow from the so called  closure relation \" between the temporal index @xmath295 and spectral index @xmath287 , provided that the ic component can be neglected .",
    "such a closure relation can be obtained from case a described in  [ sec : lightcurves ] in either ism or wind cases .",
    "the application of this method to optical afterglows should be cautious .",
    "the early optical light curve has a broken power law profile around @xmath252 . in contrary to the early x - ray afterglow",
    "whose @xmath252 is much earlier and which can be regarded as a simple power law one , the optical light curve might be affected moderately when the equal arrival time surface effect is included .",
    "another reason is that the reddening in optical spectra is unknown .",
    "while the galactic extinction can be empirically decoupled , the extinction and reddening within the circum - burst environment and host galaxy are less constrained .",
    "these two facts prevent the credible measurements of the temporal and spectral indices of optical afterglows , respectively .",
    "we have got the criteria for the emergence of ic components in soft x - ray afterglows , through giving the lower limits of external medium densities . in the ism case ,",
    "the lower limit of @xmath175 is @xmath339 @xmath10 in the fast - cooling phase , while it is @xmath12 @xmath10 in the slow - cooling phase ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "these are typical densities of interstellar media in our galaxy . in the wind case ,",
    "the lower limit of the wind parameter is always @xmath340 ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "such a critical @xmath11 is also typical for wolf - rayet stars in our galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that the wind parameter obtained from fitting afterglows within the wind interaction model seems to be quite small ( chevalier & li 1999 , 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; dai & wu 2003 ; chevalier , li , & fransson 2004 ) .",
    "the contradiction may be due to the limitation of our knowledge about the mass losses of massive stars at the last stage before their collapses .",
    "taking the inferred low @xmath11 from afterglows , we draw a tentative conclusion that the ic components in x - ray afterglows are insignificant in the stellar wind case .",
    "for such a low @xmath11 , a wind bubble would be produced and surrounded by either an outer giant molecular cloud , a slow wind at previous evolutionary stage , or an extremely high pressure in a star - burst environment ( dai & wu 2003 ; chevalier , li , & fransson 2004 ) .",
    "the termination shock radius of the wind bubble will be reached by the grb shock within hours in observer s frame .",
    "the environment of the shock will change from wind type to uniform medium type after this time .",
    "we have neglected such a complicated case in this work . recently , yost et al .",
    "( 2003 ) had relaxed the assumption of a constant magnetic equipartition factor @xmath1 and broadened the circum - burst medium types .",
    "they had made a detailed comparison between the results of different assumptions as well as different circum - burst media , and found the degeneracy of different assumed evolutions of @xmath1 and different medium types .",
    "anyway , we adopt the constant @xmath1 assumption and consider the most possible medium types , i.e. the ism and the stellar wind .    the radiative corrections in modelling afterglows are important .",
    "such an effect should be taken into account seriously in analysis of afterglows , especially when a large number of afterglows will be observed in the _ swift _ era .",
    "it will affect directly the energetics of grb remnants and therefore the actual efficiency of prompt grbs ( wu et al . in preparation , which also includes the ics effect ) .",
