    "also , in the case when @xmath0 is edge  transitive the distance  balance triples are unique up to switching of left and right components .",
    "semisymmetric graphs have no automorphisms which switch adjacent vertices , and therefore , may arguably be considered as good candidates for graphs which are not distance  balanced .",
