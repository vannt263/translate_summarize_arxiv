    "the nonstandard polymer quantization @xcite is a quantization procedure for mechanical models which implements some of the techniques of the loop quantization program @xcite .",
    "its main feature is a singular representation of the weyl algebra @xcite in a non - separable hilbert space and as a result , the canonical commutation relations @xcite can not be recovered by using the stone - von neumann theorems @xcite .",
    "polymer quantization can be applied to a broad range of mechanical systems related with atomic physics @xcite as well as in cosmology @xcite or in quantum field theory @xcite and statistical mechanics @xcite just to mention some examples .",
    "each of them serves as a toy model which provides specific hints about the procedure required to compare the non - regular and regular quantizations in the much more complicated context of quantum space - time .",
    "nevertheless , on its own it represents an interesting model to study from a mathematical physics perspective @xcite .",
    "the non - regularity of the weyl algebra representation avoids the definition of the momentum operator and makes impossible the usual dynamical characterization of the system .",
    "this obstacle is circumvented by proposing an operator that mimics the role of the absent operator @xcite .",
    "this artificial operator is formed as a combination of holonomies @xmath3 and depends on a length parameter @xmath4 . for the case of the polymer harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the standard kinematical term @xmath5 is replaced by the operator @xmath6 , \\label{kterm}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the ` holonomy operator ' with a fixed value for the parameter @xmath4 .    in the loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "scenario , the analogous of the parameter @xmath4 possesses a fixed value given by the planck length . for mechanical models ,",
    "the nature of the parameter is ambiguous due to its non - fundamental characterization .",
    "however , its value is fixed although undetermined and can be seen as providing a measure of discretization of space .",
    "since no discreteness of space has been detected , the deviations of the polymer physical quantities from those observed within the regular quantization can not be experimentally tested . on the other hand , the physical quantities involved in polymer systems",
    "acquire corrections which are proportional to ( powers of ) @xmath4 . as a consequence , in mechanical systems",
    "@xmath4 must be much smaller than the natural length parameters associated with the system .",
    "the estimated value of the parameter @xmath4 for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator is about @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the quantum corrections of these systems become significant in regimes where quantum mechanics would be inapplicable .",
    "hamiltonian commutation relations between the operator @xmath8 and an arbitrary holonomy @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 = - \\alpha \\widehat{v}_\\alpha$ ] .",
    "they are irreducibly represented on the hilbert space @xmath11 which is given by @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the bohr compactification of the real line and @xmath14 is a regular haar measure on it @xcite .",
    "this hilbert space was built by mimicking the loop quantization program as was mentioned before @xcite . in this case , the representation of the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an element of the uncountable basis on @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "a particular effect of the polymer construction coming as a result of the introduction of the aforementioned parameter is the modification of the dynamical equation of the quantum system .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system when using the kinetic term ( [ kterm ] ) takes the form @xmath18 + \\frac{1}{2 } m \\omega^2 \\widehat{x}^2 . \\label{phamiltonian}\\ ] ] hamiltonian ( [ phamiltonian ] ) splits the full polymer hilbert space @xmath11 as an ( uncountable ) direct sum of separable hilbert spaces @xmath19 of the form @xmath20 or in the notation used in @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the countable measure on the interval @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the non - separability of the hilbert space @xmath11 renders discrete the nature of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "each @xmath19 is given by @xmath24 and their observables algebra is now generated by @xmath8 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 . as a result",
    ", these hilbert spaces @xmath19 , each of them labeled by @xmath2 , are superselected .",
    "notice that the spatial scale given by @xmath4 naturally induces a scale with momentum dimensions given by @xmath27 the schrdinger equation for a given state @xmath28 takes the form @xmath29 \\psi^{(\\lambda)}(p ) = e^{(\\lambda ) } \\psi^{(\\lambda)}(p ) , \\label{schrp}\\ ] ] with the additional condition @xmath30 in order to properly generate states in the entire polymer hilbert space using states of each superselected sector .",
    "observe that when @xmath31 in ( [ bcondition ] ) , then the wave functions @xmath32 are @xmath33 periodic functions . on the other hand , the parameter @xmath2 in ( [ bcondition ] ) can be seen as a fixed dual bloch wave vector .",
    "the equation ( [ schrp ] ) can be written into the more familiar form of the mathieu equation @xcite by using a dimensionless variable @xmath34 within the interval @xmath35 as @xmath36 where the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 in ( [ mequation ] ) are given by @xmath39 the spectrum of the eq .",
    "( [ mequation ] ) is given by a series derived with a recursive method and the appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the expression for any of the eigenvalues of the mathieu equation are very difficult to handle at analytical level , and hence , only its approximate expressions can be used . if we consider periodic solutions ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) then the spectrum of the mathieu equation @xcite given by ( [ mequation ] ) tends to the spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the formal limit @xmath41 ( figure [ eigenvalues ] ) . in this limit , the known results of the standard theory of the quantum harmonic oscillator are recovered as we already mentioned . for cases in which @xmath42 ,",
    "the equation can be solved by using floquet theory for non - periodic mathieu functions @xcite .     in terms of the quotient @xmath43.,width=302 ]    as can be seen , an interesting result of the replacement of the kinetic term given in ( [ kterm ] ) is that in the momentum representation , this term turns out to be a periodic potential , in sharp contrast to the quantum harmonic oscillator in which this property is absent .",
    "nevertheless , it also renders periodic the semiclassical description , via path integral formulation @xcite which is , in this sense , a desired result .",
    "this feature results from the fact that ( [ kterm ] ) is a particular case of an almost periodic schrdinger operator @xcite i.e. , operators formed by a finite sum of holonomies .",
    "recently , barbero et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the energy spectrum of ( [ phamiltonian ] ) consists of an uncountable number of eigenvalues grouped in bands , very much like those appearing in the study of periodic potentials in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the main difference is that the polymer energy spectrum is entirely discrete although grouped in bands whereas in the standard periodic potentials is continuum and grouped in bands .",
    "this peculiarity of the spectrum creates some difficulties in the development of the formalism both to define unitary evolution and to build suitable statistical ensembles .",
    "it also emerges both , at the full loop theory and , in its symmetry reduced quantum mechanical versions @xcite .",
    "however , some proposals for constructing a separable hilbert space are recently given for the case of quantum mechanical models @xcite .",
    "they essentially propose replacing the countable measure @xmath22 by a lebesgue measure @xmath44 on the same interval .",
    "a key point in barbero s results is the burnat - shubin - herczyski theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem establishes that the spectrum of an almost periodic operator is the same no matter if the representation is regular or singular .",
    "representations only modify the nature of the spectrum of almost periodic schrdinger operators in that if it is discrete or continuous . in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ phamiltonian ] )",
    ", its spectrum is identical to that of the quantum pendulum in the standard representation @xcite .",
    "periodic potential systems are very familiar in standard quantum mechanics , particularly in solid state physics @xcite . among other features , these potentials have an infinite set of oscillators - like eigenstates only when barrier penetration is ignored . otherwise , tunneling effect between each of",
    "the ` classical vacuums ' gives rise to the band structure of the spectrum . in standard",
    "quantum mechanics , the tunneling effect can be realized by instanton and anti - instanton pseudo - particles in the long imaginary time regime @xcite although it may be obtained within the deep quantum regime @xcite .",
    "instanton methods are a non - perturbative technique developed for handling phenomena in quantum field theory , and in particular in quantum chromodynamics , analogous to barrier penetration in quantum particle mechanics .    in the polymer quantization",
    ", the tunnel effect can also yields the band structure of the spectrum indicated by barbero et al . in this scenario ,",
    "the long time behavior of the penetration amplitude of the polymer harmonic oscillator by using instanton methods can be considered . in this case , each well at @xmath45 entails a classical vacuum from which the tunneling effect can occur in analogy to the result in the standard quantum pendulum @xcite .",
    "having said this , our goal here is to determine the penetration amplitude of the tunneling effect on the polymer harmonic oscillator between the minima in the entire polymer hilbert space and to obtain the band structure of the minimum of the spectrum .",
    "for this purpose , we are going to apply instanton methods to the polymer harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mathematical structure of the polymer harmonic oscillator ( and other polymer quantum systems ) is very much similar to that of the lattice quantization of such systems @xcite .",
    "notice for example that the super - selected hilbert space @xmath19 is the same hilbert space used in the lattice quantization of the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "however , although they coincides in this hilbert space , in both schemes there are conceptual aspects which makes them considerably different .",
    "for example , the polymer quantum mechanics ( pqm ) , as mimicking the lqg procedure , can be seen as a result of the gns - construction of the weyl algebra with a non - regular positive linear functional @xcite .",
    "the discreteness of the space in pqm is a result of such positive linear functional ( see @xcite for details ) and there is not a preferred lattice or so involved at this point .",
    "the lattice - type similarity emerges when the fictitious operator @xmath46 given in ( [ kterm ] ) is invoked . as a result",
    ", the fundamental discreteness of the space is unveiled by the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , the limit @xmath41 can be seen as a formal mathematical trick in order to compare the physical quantities within the polymer description with their similar in the standard quantization .    on the other hand ,",
    "lattice quantum mechanics is a generalization of the standard quantization techniques on a discrete space .",
    "its powerful cousin , the lattice quantum field theory , provides remarkable results in removing the awkward divergences of the quantum field theory within a continuous space .",
    "such results has proven to be particularly useful in quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , in these cases , the lattice structure together with the discreteness of the space are fixed by hand , that is to say , the lattice is not a fundamental description of the space . in order to recover the physical description of the system , the limit when the lattice parameter tends to zero is the ultimate step .",
    "summarizing , both schemes coincide mathematically once the super - selected sector in polymer quantum mechanics is fixed .",
    "the differences between both quantum models are twofold : the non - separability of the hilbert space which is a distinguishing feature of the polymer quantum mechanics , whereas in lattice quantum mechanics the hilbert space is separable .",
    "secondly , the limit of the lattice parameter @xmath41 , which is a mathematical trick in polymer quantum mechanics , is the final procedure in lattice quantization .    in this spirit",
    ", the present work is directed to establish a link between the known results of lattice quantum mechanics and instanton methods applied to the quantum pendulum and the polymer quantization of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the discrete nature of the parameter @xmath2 in these results offers new insights for instance in the statistical mechanics of the polymer harmonic oscillator and in the polymer quantization of the scalar field as we will discuss in the last section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ pho ]",
    "we express the transition amplitude of the polymer harmonic oscillator in terms of the amplitudes of non - restricted regular hilbert spaces . in section [ instantonsol ]",
    "we obtain the instanton solutions and discuss its main properties .",
    "the analysis of the quantum fluctuation of the instanton solution together with the penetration barrier amplitude calculation is reported in section [ qfinst ] . finally in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary state @xmath47 .",
    "this state can be decomposed as @xmath48 , where @xmath28 .",
    "as we already mentioned , the hilbert spaces @xmath19 are superselected and therefore , the hamiltonian @xmath49 given in ( [ phamiltonian ] ) acts on this state as @xmath50 and notice that the hamiltonian operator moves inside the summation on the right hand side . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution operator of a given state @xmath51 takes the form @xmath52 where the hamiltonian operator is now understood as the one acting on the hilbert space @xmath19 . from now on let us fix the value of @xmath2 and let us make all the calculations on this specific hilbert space @xmath19 . the symbol @xmath2",
    "will be omitted for simplicity unless it is required to avoid confusion .",
    "the momentum variable @xmath53 in the quantum configuration space of @xmath19 is confined to the interval @xmath54 and this is a topological constraint @xcite . in this section , we obtain an expression ( [ amplitude ] ) in terms of the amplitude of a system without the topological constraint , i.e. , a system in which the momentum variable @xmath55 . to do so ,",
    "let us follow the procedure given in @xcite for these systems .",
    "first , let us decompose the time interval @xmath56 given in ( [ amplitude ] ) into @xmath57 pieces @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the exponential in ( [ amplitude ] ) can now be written as @xmath57 products of infinitesimal time interval exponentials @xmath61    in the polymer construction , within the @xmath62polarization , the completeness relation of the momentum basis @xcite is of the form @xmath63 notice that the integration must end at an infinitesimal piece below @xmath64 to avoid the double - counting of contributions of the identical points @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we now introduce ( [ completep ] ) on each product and obtain @xmath67 \\prod^{n+1}_{j=1 } \\langle p_j , t_j | p_{j-1 } , t_{j - i } \\rangle , \\label{tdecomp}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this expression allow us to derive separately the infinitesimal amplitudes @xmath70 which can be written as @xmath71 and in order to calculate ( [ finfiam ] ) we consider apart the zeroth hamiltonian infinitesimal amplitude @xmath72    in an unconstrained system , the right hand side of the previous expression is the dirac delta orthonormality condition of the basis elements @xmath73 , that is to say , @xmath74 . in the present case , we can not use this relation because is not well defined .",
    "the reason is that it gives rise to a boundary condition different to that in ( [ bcondition ] ) . for our case ,",
    "the adequate orthonormality condition in @xmath19 reads as @xmath75    to verify that we recover the relation ( [ bcondition ] ) from the relation ( [ driacdin ] ) , let us add @xmath76 to the @xmath53 variable on both sides of ( [ driacdin ] ) .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations we obtain @xmath77 and now , removing @xmath78 from both sides and multiplying by @xmath79 we recover ( [ bcondition ] ) .    using ( [ driacdin ] ) the zeroth hamiltonian amplitude in ( [ samplitude ] ) can be written as @xmath80 where the dirac deltas inside the summation in the first line are written in terms of its fourier transforms in the second line .",
