    "* hereafter paper-1 ) , using the combined greenwich ( may/1874 to 1976 ) and solar optical observatories network ( 19772009 ) data on sunspot groups , we studied the long - term variations in the daily mean percentage growth and decay rates of sunspot groups .",
    "two of the main results found from this study are : ( i ) from the beginning of cycle  23 the growth rate is substantially decreased and near the end ( 20072008 ) the growth rate is lowest in the past about 100 years .",
    "( ii ) in the extended part ( beyond the length of the declining part of a normal cycle ) of the declining phase of this cycle , the decay rate steeply increased and it is largest in the beginning of the current cycle  24 .",
    "these unusual properties of the growth and the decay rates during cycle  23 may be related to cause of the very long declining phase of this cycle with the unusually deep and prolonged current minimum .",
    "however , no significant correlation was found either between spot group growth rate and sunspot number or between the latter and spot group decay rate .",
    "the patterns of variations in the growth and decay rates are found to be considerably different in different cycles .",
    "in fact , the mean percentage growth rate of the spot groups in the declining phases of some cycles is found to be considerably large and the mean percentage decay rate of the spot groups in the rising phases of some cycles is found to be considerably large ( see fig .  6 in paper-1 ) . in the present paper we showed that the annual amounts of growth and decay of spot groups well correlated to the annual amount of activity and discussed the implications of this result on the solar cycle variation of the solar energetic phenomena such such as solar flares and that of the total solar irradiance ( tsi ) .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the growth and decay rates of the spot groups on their sizes .",
    "such a study may help for understanding the underlying mechanism of the emergence / growth and decay of magnetic flux .    in the next section",
    "we describe the methodology and the data analysis . in section  3",
    "we present the results . in section",
    "4 we draw conclusions and briefly discuss the implications of them .",
    "here we have used the combined greenwich ( may/1874 to december/1976 ) and solar optical observation network ( soon ) ( january/1977 to may/2011 ) sunspot group data , which are taken from david hathaway s website , http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwich.shtml .",
    "these data included the observation time ( the greenwich data contain the date with the fraction of the day , in the soon data the fraction is rounded to 0.5 day ) , heliographic latitude and longitude , central meridian distance ( cmd ) , and corrected umbra and whole - spot areas ( in millionth of solar hemisphere , msh ) , etc .",
    ", of the spot groups for each day of observation .",
    "the positions of the groups are geometrical positions of the centers of the groups . in case of soon data , we increased area by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "david hathaway found this correction was necessary to have a combined homogeneous greenwich and soon data ( see aforementioned web - site of david hathaway ) .",

    "we analysed a large and reliable sunspot group data and found that the total amounts of growth and decay of spot groups whose life times @xmath0 days in a given time interval ( say one - year ) well correlate to the amount of activity in the same interval .",
    "we have also found that there exist a reasonably good correlation and an approximate linear relationship between the logarithmic values of the decay rate and area of the spot group at the first day of the corresponding consecutive days , largely suggesting that a large / small area ( magnetic flux ) decreases in a faster / slower rate .",

    "the growth of spot groups ( enhancement of magnetic flux ) may have a large contribution from the emergence of new magnetic flux .",

    "magnetic reconnection is believed to be the main mechanism behind the solar energetic phenomena such as the solar flares , coronal mass ejection , etc .. thus , the solar cycle variation in the decay of spot groups may have significant roles in the corresponding variations in the solar energetic phenomena , particularly solar flares which are mainly originate at sunspot locations .    * the relationship ( [ eqn4 ] ) ( see foot note of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 relations in sec .",
    "3.1 ) largely implies a change in the topology of surface magnetic flux in every 10 days , which is consistent with the following results / inferences : @xcite analysed mt .",
    "wilson magnetograph data during the period 1967 to mid-1980 and found that the rate at which the magnetic flux appears on the sun is sufficient to create all the flux that is seen at the solar surface within a period of about 10 days .",
    "the magnetic structures of the sunspot groups may rise from near the bottom of the convention zone to the surface in about 10 days  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a @xmath54  10-day periodicity seems to be predominantly present in the solar surface differential rotation , total solar irradiance ( tsi ) , solar coronal holes , solar wind , auroral electron power , and geomagnetic parameters  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ,",
    "all these may be related to the topology of the sun s surface magnetic field .",
    "*    it is known that tsi varies by about 0.1% over the solar cycle .",
    "a number of statistical models of tsi variability have been constructed on the basis of inhomogeneities of surface magnetic field .",
    "these models helped to identify the surface magnetic structures are responsible for the variation of tsi and also provided widely accepted theoretical explanations . according to these models ,",
    "the dominant part of the tsi variations on time scales longer than about a day is caused by the evolution of solar surface magnetic features .",
    "however , the exact mechanism behind the tsi variation is not known  @xcite .",
    "tsi is well correlating with the solar activity ( for example with sunspot number ) and during the current unusually low and prolonged minimum tsi also seems to be unusually low  @xcite .",
    "sunspots and faculae act in opposite to modulate tsi @xcite .",
