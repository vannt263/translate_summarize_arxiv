    "the classical view of comets as icy conglomerations and asteroids as chunks of rock has been supplanted in the last decade by the realization that a population of objects exists between the two traditional extremes  comets are dirty iceballs and asteroids are icy dirtballs with the relative contribution and morphological structure of the ice and rock giving rise to the classical views of each object .",
    "thus , in the classical view , asteroids always exhibit bare nuclei photometric properties @xcite while comets are characterized by a transient atmosphere and/or tail @xcite .",
    "the early compositional distinction between asteroids and comets was further supported by the apparent bimodality in their orbit distributions  the known asteroids had nearly circular orbits confined to the torus of objects between mars and jupiter while the known comets had highly eccentric orbits taking them beyond jupiter , neptune and even out to the oort cloud ) - comets typically have @xmath7 while asteroids generally have @xmath8 . ] .",
    "the modern view was ushered in by the discovery of comet - asteroid transition objects . in the ensemble of known small bodies there",
    "exist comets with asteroidal dynamical properties ( _ e.g. _ ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , asteroids on cometary orbits @xcite , and damocloids ( inactive comets with dynamical properties of halley - family and long - period comets ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work focuses on those objects that appear to be comets  their morphology being consistent with a cometary nature in the sense that they exhibit comae or tails  but have asteroid - like orbits embedded in the main belt of asteroids . to this end , we have performed a well - characterized search for low - level cometary activity amongst a sample of nearly 1000 asteroids fromtalcs @xcite .",
    "the first cometary main belt object , now known as a main belt comet ( mbc ) or an `` activated asteroid '' , was identified in observations of what is now known as comet 133p / elst - pizarro ( hereafter , ep ; * ? ? ?",
    "it exhibits recurrent dust ejection over several weeks or months @xcite .",
    "@xcite described a detailed study of ep and showed that its cometary activity is correlated with heliocentric distance .",
    "@xcite then showed that ep s activity is also seasonal  there is a region on the surface that becomes active when it experiences its local ` summer ' .",
    "they then explored two dynamical scenarios that might explain ep s transient cometary activity and its orbital characteristics embedded in the outer region of the main belt .",
    "their first scenario is that ep began as a jupiter family comet ( jfc ) but migrated inward via both non - gravitational ( _ i.e. _ ,  cometary outgassing ) and gravitational influences .",
    "however , none of the simulations of the dynamical evolution of jfc test particles under solely gravitational influences result in an inclination as low as ep s @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that non - gravitational forces can be strong enough to bring ep to its contemporary orbit , but its current activity level is unlikely to have produced enough of a perturbation to do so @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that ep could be the first of a large number of asteroids containing a reservoir of ice beneath their surface .",
    "this scenario is consistent with thermal evolution models of large asteroids that escaped primordial heating and with evidence of aqueous alterations in meteorites ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that crystalline water ice from the time of their formation can survive within the interior of outer main belt asteroids .",
    "the mbcs were not discovered earlier because they are rare and their activity is both weak and/or transient .",
    "the release of buried volatiles requires some triggering event like an impact ( even a small one ) or the warming effect of perihelion passage ( @xcite ) , and their detection requires regular monitoring of a large sample of asteroids .",
    "these conditions were not met until the advent of modern wide - field asteroid surveys .",
    "the origin of ep and other mbcs is of interest in planetary formation in part because they offer an opportunity to identify the location of the ` snow line '  the heliocentric distance at which ices condensed in the early solar system ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "mbcs should only be found outside the snowline assuming that there has been only limited heliocentric mixing of the asteroids .",
    "furthermore , the existence and properties of a large sample of mbcs will provide tests of asteroid thermal models , common origin scenarios , and dispersion mechanisms .",
    "for example , considering significant instead of limited heliocentric mixing , mbc studies can provide hints on how this mechanism functioned in the early solar system environment .    in an attempt to identify more mbcs",
    "when only two were known , @xcite conducted a targeted survey of about 300 asteroids in the outer main belt and found one more in the orbital region of the other two mbcs .",
    "all three have similar orbit characteristics with @xmath9 au , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( table [ tab : knownmbcs ] ) .",
    "two of the three belong to the themis dynamical family while the third ( p / read ) has an eccentricity slightly higher than the themis family s upper limit .",
    "@xcite suggest that p / read used to be a themis family member that is dynamically evolving away from its parent cluster .",
    "@xcite estimated that the mbc : mba ratio is @xmath11:300 and measured mbc mass loss rates in the range of @xmath12 kg / s compared to typical cometary mass loss rates of @xmath13 ( kg / s ) @xmath14 ( _ e.g. _ ,   * ? ? ?",
    "since then , four additional mbcs have been discovered outside the vicinity of the original three mbcs with two of them located in the middle belt .",
    "some characteristics of all seven objects are provided in table [ tab : knownmbcs ] . for at least two of the mbcs in table [ tab : knownmbcs ] ,",
    "the observed activity is most likely the result of asteroid collisions and be devoid of recurrent activity characteristic of comets ( 596 scheila and p/2010 a2/linear ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the major difficulties in searching for new mbcs and mapping their distribution is detecting and quantifying their subtle cometary nature .",
    "several techniques have been employed in the past to identify low activity comets ; most were designed to search for faint comae .",
    "one method is to identify optical emission lines of typical cometary gases ( _ e.g. _ ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . detecting these faint spectroscopic features ( _ e.g. _",
    ",  the cn(0 - 0 ) and c@xmath15 bands at 388 nm and 517 nm , respectively ) requires high @xmath16 objects and a relatively large amount of telescope time for each object making it difficult to employ on a large sample of main belt candidates .",
    "another method to search for cometary activity requires multiple photometric observations of the targets over a wide range of phase angles to identify non - asteroidal photometric behavior .",
    "the flux of scattered light off an asteroidal target is proportional to the product of its phase function , the inverse square of its heliocentric distance , and the inverse square of its geocentric distance .",
    "failure of the target s photometric profile to follow this behavior suggests a variable coma @xcite .",
    "speckle interferometry has also been used to distinguish comae but it is limited to only the brightest objects with @xmath17 , limiting this process to the largest @xmath128,000 asteroids or @xmath17% of the known main belt objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "the process also requires considerable telescope time for each target .",
    "@xcite attempted to identify main - belt comets morphologically using the expected fwhm - broadening of the target psf perpendicular to the direction of motion . in a follow - up paper , @xcite identified one object that may be either an mbc candidate or a regular comet and set an upper limit on the number of mbcs in the main belt of @xmath18 to a limiting size of @xmath19  km ( absolute magnitude @xmath20 ) .    to identify mbc candidates @xcite compared mbc candidates to stellar profiles with the expectation that a wider asteroidal profile would indicate the presence of coma .",
    "we adopted and refined this method in our search for new mbcs amongst the asteroids identified in talcs @xcite .",
    "that survey identified 924 asteroids with multiple @xmath21 detections of each object using the cfht s megaprime camera .",
    "our goal was to carefully examine each talcs asteroid for low - level cometary activity and determine the mbc number distribution as a function of semi - major axis ( @xmath22 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath23 ) , inclination ( @xmath24 ) , and absolute magnitude ( @xmath25 ) or diameter ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we used two techniques to identify cometary activity around otherwise asteroidal objects : one for tail detection and another for comae detection .",
    "we then corrected for observational selection effects and derived limits on the unbiased orbit and number distribution of the mbcs .",
    "we obtained a large set of asteroid detections from talcs @xcite which was designed to measure light curve properties of @xmath27 main belt asteroids with diameters in the range 0.5  km @xmath28 10  km .",
    "the survey was conducted with the canada - france - hawaii telescope s megaprime camera whose image plane is instrumented with an array of 36 ccds that each contain @xmath29 pixels . with a pixel scale of @xmath30/pixel megacam covers a field of @xmath31 .",
    "talcs used the @xmath32 and @xmath33 filters with integration times of 20 and 40 seconds yielding 5-@xmath34 detections at about 23.3 and 24.3 magnitudes respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dist_talcs_vs_ast ] shows that the number distribution of talcs objects is well - sampled through the main belt . in the inner belt ( @xmath35  au ) , middle belt ( @xmath36  au ) and outer belt ( @xmath37  au )",
    "there were 286 , 287 and 352 objects respectively .",
    "it is unsurprising that the distribution of talcs objects in semi - major axis and eccentricity matches that of the known objects because in these elements the talcs survey is similar to most other asteroid surveys .",
    "talcs is biased against high - inclination objects ( see figure [ fig : dist_talcs_vs_ast]c ) because it surveyed a relatively small region on the ecliptic for a short period of time .",
    "the median @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath38 km in diameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this size range is well suited to a mbc search based on the known objects listed in table [ tab : knownmbcs ] .",
    "the three mbcs observed by @xcite had tails or dust trails but weak or nonexistent comae .",
    "this observation motivated us to develop an algorithm to identify mbc tails but the problem is complicated by the facts that they 1 ) are much fainter than typical cometary tails , 2 ) are transient and may appear or disappear during the course of the talcs survey and 3 ) may appear at any position angle and change their orientation from night - to - night . our tail detection algorithm needed to be robust against all these possibilities .",
    "our tail identification strategy was to divide an annulus of sky around each detection into eighteen @xmath39 truncated pie segments ( figure [ fig : elstpizpie ] ) and search for an anomalously bright segment , comparing the result to a set of comparison stars .",
    "using segments is preferable to summing the light in the entire annulus because the @xmath16 of a tail detection increases as the square root of the number of segments as long as the tail falls into only one segment .",
    "the benefit of noise suppression dominates even though the number of opportunities for a false detection scales with the number of segments .",
    "this technique is an analog to a traditional matched detection kernel using a detection region that mimics the shape of the detected object .",
    "we used a detection annulus extending from @xmath40 to @xmath41 from the asteroid .",
    "for an asteroid at a geocentric distance of @xmath42 au , this is equivalent @xmath43 km from the nucleus . to reduce contamination of the mbc candidate by other faint astronomical sources in the image we rejected asteroid and comparison star detections with a neighboring object within @xmath44 .",
    "a larger annulus increases the @xmath16 only modestly but greatly increases the number of images rejected because of neighboring objects .",
    "the diameter of the inner edge of the annulus was selected to avoid most of the light from the target s psf .",
    "trailing is not an issue because the inner radius of the detection aperture is much larger than the typical trailing distance of @xmath45 .    for each image ( detection ) @xmath24 of each asteroid",
    "we determine the flux of the brightest annular segment and repeat the procedure for nearby stars in the same image with fluxes similar to the asteroid .",
    "next , we rank the brightest segment of the asteroid among the brightest segment of the stars with a cumulative parameter @xmath46 . for example",
    ", @xmath47 would mean that the brightest segment for asteroid detection @xmath24 is in the top 10% of all the brightest segments of the comparison stars . under the null hypothesis of no mbc activity the values of @xmath46",
    "are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 . in the presence of mbc activity",
    "there is an excess of detections having small values of @xmath46 .",
    "a compelling feature of this method is that the null hypothesis distribution of @xmath46 is well defined , non - parametric , and immune to many types of systematics .",
    "the set of @xmath46 that are used to combine data across observing nights are independent of variations in observing conditions and concentrations of background contamination ( _ e.g. _ ,  unresolved galaxies ) because it is calibrated with stars observed under the same conditions within the same image .",
    "the sensitivity of any search method depends on the strength of the signal ( in our case , the tail ) relative to random background noise and systematic background artifacts . to test the sensitivity of our tail identification method we performed a monte carlo simulation using simplified gaussian statistics to generate a set of @xmath46 with signal strengths expressed as a fraction of the standard deviation of counts over the entire annulus .",
    "we then compared the set to the uniform null hypothesis .",
    "we assumed 50 identical observations per object and 100 calibration stars . in the actual data , we have @xmath48 valid measurements of each asteroid , and each measurement uses @xmath49 calibration stars within @xmath50 magnitude of its object .",
    "we repeated the procedure for @xmath51 1 , 9 , 18 , and 36 segments corresponding to angular widths of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "for each @xmath56 we conducted 1000 trials and computed the median kolmogorov - smirnov is derived if it is unlikely that the two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution . ] probability with which a tail of the given strength is recovered . for comparison",
    ", we also computed the recovery strength for simple additive and median stacking of the images assuming no systematic noise and perfect tail alignment among images .",
    "figure [ fig : slicemethodstrength ] shows that our 18 segment scheme can detect tails at the @xmath57 significance if they have a tail s / n of @xmath58 .",
    "increasing @xmath56 allows the detection of fainter tails but we chose @xmath5118 as a compromise between sensitivity and the ability to detect wide tails .",
    "we selected a @xmath59 significance as our threshold detection level because a given asteroid will achieve this level by chance only 1 time out of @xmath60 , so our @xmath27 asteroid sample has a 1 in 100 chance of containing a value this large .",
    "in other words , a signal at this level for an asteroid in our sample would provide roughly 100 to 1 evidence for mbc activity if we believe that there is a good chance that there is one mbc in our sample .",
    "additive or median stacking of the images followed by selecting the brightest segment can detect fainter tails than our approach but these techniques are sensitive to image artifacts as well as tail rotation and transience . even though additive",
    "stacking is the most sensitive method in fig .",
    "[ fig : slicemethodstrength ] , it would not suppress image artifacts and we do not consider it a viable option .",
    "relative to median stacking our method trades a factor of two in sensitivity in the ability to connect images obtained under different observing conditions .",
    "it permits the tail to rotate in position angle between images and allows for the possiblity that activity ceases in some images ( in which case median stacking could lose the signal entirely ) .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of our method on real data using mbc images obtained with the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2-m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the three known mbcs there are 17 to 25 300s exposures totaling 1.5 to 2.1 hours of exposure time  the equivalent of forty minutes cumulative exposure on the larger cfht telescope used for talcs .",
    "hence , the total exposure time for the three mbcs is similar to that of a cfht talcs object imaged on a hundred 30s exposures . the shorter talcs / cfht exposure , with four times less signal than the 2.2-m data , will suppress the @xmath16 of the brightest segment by a factor of 2 in any individual exposure relative to the uh 2.2-m data .",
    "thus , the uh 2.2-m data set allows the identification of tails that are half as bright as the cfht / talcs data but the larger number of exposures in talcs allows a more robust rejection of the null hypothesis uniform @xmath61 distribution .",
    "figure [ fig:88mbcstats ] shows the @xmath61 distributions produced by our method for three known mbcs .",
    "the number of entries in the histograms are considerably smaller than the number of exposures because our stringent background rejection criteria removed many images from the sample . in each case",
    ", the kolmogorov - smirnov probability @xmath62 is much smaller than unity , strongly ruling out the null hypothesis .",
    "even the faintest mbc , 176p / linear , for which a tail is invisible to the eye in individual exposures , shows a tail detection in each frame using our polar segment method .",
    "moreover , from the inset circular histograms it is evident that the brightest segment consistently points in the same direction providing a second signature of mbc activity .",
    "table [ tab : knownmbcstails ] provides two measures of the technique s sensitivity for three known mbc tails : in terms of 1 ) the tail flux as a fraction of the object s central flux and 2 ) the @xmath32 magnitude within the brightest detection segment .",
    "we used the published @xmath63 magnitudes for the three mbcs @xcite and the color transformations of @xcite to calculate @xmath32 .",
    "two of the mbcs have a total tail magnitude in the detection aperture of @xmath64 while the third is about one magnitude brighter .",
    "thus , the technique is capable of detecting tail activity corresponding to a few percent of the brightness of the object itself .",
    "finally , we measured our ability to recover artificial tails inserted into the talcs data .",
    "figure [ fig : talcssimtail ] shows that tails with @xmath65 in the detection slice , comparable to the tail brightness of the fainter known mbcs , would almost always be recovered with @xmath66 . since any detection with @xmath67 in our sample of @xmath68 objects is indicative of genuine mbc activity at the 99% confidence level , this technique is clearly sensitive to mbc activity at the level of the known objects .",
    "figure [ fig : talcssimtail]c shows that tails that are only 0.5 magnitudes fainter than 23.12 would not be reliably detected .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of fainter tails is detectable over the ensemble as a whole and their magnitude is recovered correctly as shown in figure [ fig : talcssimtail]d .",
    "comets may exhibit a coma despite having a weak or undetectable tail ( _ e.g. _ ,  49p / arend - rigaux , * ? ? ? * ) but detecting the contribution of faint coma to the nuclear psf is difficult .",
    "thus , we developed a technique to identify faint comae by expanding upon the work of @xcite .",
    "for each talcs object @xmath69 , we fit a stacked image of all detections for the object ( @xmath70 ) to a linear combination of a target - specific asteroid psf model ( @xmath71 ) and target - specific isotropic coma psf model ( @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 where ( @xmath74 ) is the pixel in the stacked image . modeling",
    "the target flux is necessarily imprecise because 1 ) the psf varies from night - to - night and across the field - of - view of the wide - field cfht megaprime camera , 2 ) asteroids move during the course of the exposures producing trails of different lengths for each object and even for the same object in different images because they were taken up to two weeks apart , and 3 ) not all comae are isotropic .",
    "the mass loss rate ( @xmath75 ) from a comet is given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the grain density , @xmath78 is the average expelled grain radius , @xmath79 is the ratio of the flux density of the coma to that of the nucleus , @xmath80 is the radius of the target , @xmath81 is the photometric diaphragm , and @xmath63 and @xmath82 are the heliocentric and geocentric distances , respectively .",
    "we expect the particles ejected from mbcs are small - similar to cometary material with grain radii of 0.5 @xmath83 m , and we expect that they have densities typical of solid rocky material @xcite .",
    "we therefore used 0.5 @xmath83 m for grain radius and 3000 kg / m@xmath84 for grain density in our calculations . from eq .",
    "[ eq.fnfafc ] , @xmath85 , and thus we can determine the mass loss rate for the talcs objects .",
    "we calculated each objects s heliocentric and geocentric distances from their orbits and estimate their radii using @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the geometric albedo . while talcs did obtain photometry in two different filters for most of the targets the @xmath16 was not sufficient to measure accurate colors for most objects",
    "( from which we could have assumed a taxonomic type and albedo ) .",
    "therefore , we resorted to assigning a heliocentric distance - dependent albedo : @xmath88 for objects in the inner / middle / outer main belt bounded by 2.064  au@xmath892.501  au , 2.501  au@xmath892.824  au , and 2.824  au@xmath893.277  au , respectively ( @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sampleimages ] provides a schematic representation of how we produced the three components of our linear fits in eq .",
    "[ eq.fnfafc ] : 1 ) the stacked target object images , @xmath90 , to which we fit our models , 2 ) the synthetic asteroid models specific to each object , @xmath91 , that incorporate the same psf , trailing and stacking as the target objects , and 3 ) the synthetic coma models , @xmath92 , that , again , incorporate the same psf , trailing and stacking as the target objects .",
    "we began by extracting 200 @xmath93 200 pixel ( @xmath94 ) thumbnail images ( hereafter `` thumbnails '' ) for each target object @xmath69 from each image @xmath95 .",
    "the thumbnail is large enough to encompass background and a broad coma profile but also small enough to exclude most field stars .",
    "we median - stacked thumbnails of each background - subtracted flux - normalized object from images with @xmath96 seeing as determined by nearby stellar profiles . the stacking was performed with sub - pixel offsets when centroiding the objects .",
    "we combined @xmath97 and @xmath98 images because our concerns are with a morphology that would manifest itself similarly in both bands .",
    "the background was assumed to be the median of all pixels in the thumbnail excluding those within @xmath99 of the target s center and was subtracted from each raw image . since each target object appeared in multiple images under different seeing conditions and moving at slightly different rates each night the stacked object images had complicated psfs .",
    "we retrieved thumbnails for five nearby bright but unsaturated stars ( @xmath100 adu ) for each object in each image ( the median object flux being @xmath101 adu ) .",
    "we then background - subtracted , flux - normalized , and median - combined the field star thumbnails in a fashion parallel to  4.1.1 to produce stacked star images @xmath102 to be used as psf models for point sources specific to each talcs object @xmath69 in each image @xmath95 .",
    "constructing models from nearby field stars in this way maximized the similarities between the model and target psfs morphological properties .",
    "then , since the asteroids moved during each @xmath103 second exposure at rates that may have changed slightly from night to night , we artificially trailed the stacked star image ( @xmath102 ) at the corresponding object s rate of motion on a night - by - night basis to create an object - specific synthetic asteroid psf .",
    "to create the trailed psfs we created @xmath104 shifted sub - images ( @xmath105 with @xmath106 ) of the stacked stars .",
    "the shift in pixels for each sub - image @xmath107 is given by : @xmath108 where the pixel scale @xmath109/pixel and we used @xmath110 ( _ i.e. _ ,  11 sub - images ) .",
    "we need not consider cross terms because the cfht megacam @xmath111 axes are precisely aligned with ( ra , dec)=(@xmath112 ) but we did take into account the @xmath113 term for the motion in ra .",
    "the flux in each shifted stellar profile thumbnail ( @xmath105 ) was then combined such that the flux in pixel ( @xmath74 ) in the trailed , unnormalized asteroid model thumbnail ( @xmath114 ) for object @xmath69 in image @xmath95 is @xmath115 @xmath114 was then normalized by its total flux within a @xmath116radius of the center to create the synthetic asteroid model ( @xmath117 ) specific to each talcs object and image .",
    "the models were then median - combined to sub - pixel accuracy across the images with seeing @xmath118and normalized to create a synthetic asteroid model specific to each talcs object , @xmath71 .",
    "we also constructed one synthetic coma model ( @xmath72 ) per talcs object @xmath69 using a method similar to the construction of the asteroid model ( see  4.1.2 ) .",
    "we convolved a spherically symmetric @xmath119 coma profile with each synthetic asteroid model before stacking ( @xmath117 ) to create an unnormalized , image- and object- specific coma model @xmath120 .",
    "these models were then normalized by the total flux within the central @xmath116 radius , median - combined across images as for the stacked talcs objects themselves , and then once again normalized to produce the final object - specific coma model , @xmath72 .      fitting the stacked target object image to the linear combination of the stacked asteroid and coma models in eq .",
    "[ eq.fnfafc ] requires an error model for the image(s ) . the photometric error ( @xmath121 ) on each pixel of @xmath122  the normalized thumbnail for each talcs detection before median combining  is the square root of the raw photon count including the background , normalized by the total flux from the background - subtracted image . we then median - combined @xmath121 using only those images @xmath95 for which the seeing was @xmath123 ( as with the construction of the stacked target images and their asteroid and coma models ) to produce @xmath124 .",
    "the error on each pixel of the stacked target object image is then : @xmath125 where a standard factor of 1.253 is included to account for combining the median rather than the mean of the images and @xmath126 is an integer array of the number of images included in the stack at each pixel .",
    "@xmath126 is pixel - dependent because centroid shifting in the stack causes the thumbnails from different images to not overlap perfectly .",
    "a parallel method was used to determine errors for the synthetic asteroid and coma model images , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the fitting algorithm assumes that the model , the right hand side of the equation , is error - free .",
    "we incorporated all the error into our stacked target object image as @xmath129 the coma model s contribution to the error , @xmath128 , is negligible because it is a convolution of a perfectly symmetric , error - free model .      despite the care devoted to creating customized psf models for each object we found that our resulting formal errors on the fits to the stacked asteroid thumbnails could not compensate for all the systematic problems to the technique .",
    "_ i.e. _ ,  the formal errors on the derived @xmath130 values suggested that a large fraction of the objects had significant coma and mass loss rate despite there being no obvious visually detectable coma .",
    "instead , like the tail detection method described above , we resorted to using a ranking method .",
    "ranking statistics are more robust than parametric statistics because they do not assume any properties of the data ( _ e.g. _ ,  gaussian psfs ) .",
    "ranking each talcs object s coma fraction requires a set of similar objects that have no coma .",
    "we constructed the coma - free asteroid comparisons in the manner described below .",
    "first , we defined a metric @xmath131 to quantify the similarity between 1 ) a target stacked asteroid image with magnitude @xmath132 and rates of motion in the @xmath133 and @xmath134 direction of @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively and 2 ) detections of other asteroids ( @xmath107 ) with magnitude @xmath137 and rates of motion @xmath138 and @xmath139 in image @xmath24 : @xmath140 the values of @xmath22 and @xmath141 were determined empirically to be the inverse of the limit at which psfs of different magnitudes and trailing rates were similar enough to combine ( @xmath142  differential magnitudes and @xmath143  pixels ) .",

    "for each set of null - images we used the coma fitting procedure described above to determine @xmath130 and used the @xmath150 largest @xmath130 from each set ( @xmath151 ) to represent the @xmath152 statistical significance level - _ i.e. _ ,  there is a 1 in 1000 chance that a random stacking of assorted randomly chosen asteroids with mutually similar magnitudes and trailing rates ) would produce @xmath153 .",

    "figure [ fig : talcssliceresult ] shows the results of applying our segmented annulus tail detection technique described in  [ s.searchforcometarytails ] to all the asteroids in the talcs data set .",
    "the strongest detection is at the ks probability level @xmath157 which is expected to randomly occur about one third of the time in a sample of nearly 1000 asteroids .",
    "we conclude that we find no evidence of mbc tail activity in any individual asteroid within the talcs data set",
    ". this result may not be surprising because half the talcs sample has @xmath158 and thus are smaller than the smallest known mbc .",
    "smaller objects may be less likely to have tails because there is less volume to store the volatiles and less regolith to protect buried volatiles from seasonal thermal effects .",
    "it is important to note that the center panel of figure [ fig : talcssliceresult ] shows that the distribution of ks probabilities is biased to low probability events . but",
    "a numerical simulation of 1000 stars with uniform randomly chosen brightest - slice rankings @xmath61 shows that the distribution should be uniform . applying a ks test to the tail detection",

    "the right panel of figure[fig : talcssliceresult ] shows the angular distribution of the brightest detection segment compared to the distribution for matched stars .",
    "although the distributions for both stars and asteroids are non  uniform , possibly from angular asymmetries in the telescope optics , the bottom panel of the right panel shows that there is a @xmath160 excess of asteroids over stars in the @xmath161 direction .",
    "_ i.e. _ ,  the brightest segment is aligned with the expected antisolar tail direction . if the sample is restricted to asteroids where the total ks probability is limited to @xmath162 or @xmath163 , the excess at zero angle remains at the @xmath164 to @xmath165 level .",
    "thus , barring any systematic biases that we have not already taken into account , we conclude that there is evidence for low level excess directionalized flux around many of the talcs asteroids and , generalizing further , that main belt asteroids as a class exhibit weak tails or trails .",
    "unfortunately , the evidence is too weak to identify specific asteroids in our sample because none have @xmath166 . in a sample of 1000 asteroids",
    "we expect one object to have @xmath167 by chance so the small ks objects in our talcs data are not likely candidates .    while we can not select individual objects as candidates for faint mbc tails we can estimate that there is an excess of about 50 objects with faint tails in the talcs data set . in other words about 5% of the main belt objects in the talcs data set might exhibit very faint tail or trail activity .",
    "if the result is correct it implies that deep images of a large sample of main belt objects acquired in a manner suitable for analysis with our technique would identify low - level activity in main belt objects that otherwise appear asteroidal .    considering that the known mbcs are transient in their activity our result that @xmath15% of asteroids are active at _",
    "any _ time implies that a large fraction of main belt asteroids could be active at _ some _ time .",
    "this result further blurs the traditional distinction between asteroids and comets . on the other hand",
    ", we speculate that the mechanism driving the low - level tail activity might not be volatile driven ejection but the result of regolith ejection due to impacts of small meteoroids . in this case , our results offer constraints on the main belt collisional environment such as the amount of primordial implantation of ice - rich bodies and the fraction of those bodies that were collisionally disrupted ( _ e.g. _ ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we applied the technique of  [ s.searchforcometarycomae ] to fit each of the talcs objects to an asteroid and coma model and thereby measure the fractional contribution of the putative coma ( @xmath130 ) to the objects s flux .",
    "figure [ fig : comasensitivity ] shows that most of the resulting @xmath130 were below our sensitivity threshold and effectively consistent with zero .",
    "but that sensitivity threshold is sensitive to object - specific parameters such as magnitude , rates of motion , psfs , and the number of frames used in creating the stacked asteroid .",
    "thus , for each stacked asteroid the null - image stacking procedure described in  [ ss.dealingwithsystematics ] was repeated 50 times per target . in the absence of coma the distribution of @xmath147-values for",
    "all talcs objects should be uniform so that after 50 trials no more than @xmath168 of the talcs objects should have @xmath169 , as discussed in  4.1.5 .",
    "but instead of the @xmath170 expected objects we found 34 .",
    "we then subjected those 34 objects to an additional 500 trials after which we expected only @xmath42 talcs objects with @xmath169 but 8 objects fell into this bin .",
    "an additional 5000 trials for each of those 8 objects should have produced zero objects with @xmath169 but 3 remained .",
    "in other words , at this stage it appeared that we had identified 3 mbc candidates  the problem was that under detailed visual examination none of these objects displayed any visible coma .    to further investigate the 8 candidates with very high @xmath147-values ( @xmath171 ) we divided the set of images for each object in half and separately processed each half with the detection and sensitivity algorithms .",
    "if the positive detections remained in each half of the data it would suggest the coma is real . on the other hand , if the coma candidates were not detected in both halves of the data it would suggest either systematic errors in the detection and/or sensitivity algorithms or a transient phenomenon resembling a coma .    only 1 of the 8 objects had consistently positive coma detections in both halves of its data and , upon visual inspection , it was found to exhibit transient coma - like phenomena in 2 of its 6 images , one in each half .",
    "the transient phenomena may be due to it passing over a faint background source . since we expect real comae to persist over the two weeks spanned by the talcs observations , and since the signal - to - noise was poor in both the individual and combined frames for this object , we conclude that it is not a mbc candidate .",
    "thus , we have a null result in our search for cometary - like comae in the talcs survey .",
    "the derived mass loss rates for the talcs objects are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comasensitivity ] and it is no surprise that our derived mass loss rates are small and below our sensitivity limits .",
    "typical comets have mass loss rates in the range @xmath172 kg@xmath173s@xmath174 ( _ e.g. _ ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the mbcs falling in the smaller decades of the distribution but still within the range of our sensitivity limit of about @xmath175  kg@xmath173s@xmath174 .",
    "@xcite estimated that there is one active mbc for every 300 main belt asteroids based on their hawaii trails survey that focused primarily on themis family members in the outer main belt .",
    "that family and heliocentric range were of particular interest because the mbcs ep and 176p were already known to be themis family members and it seemed reasonable to expect that if sub - surface volatiles could survive since the formation of the solar system they would most likely do so in objects that are farther from the sun . considering that @xcite did not account for these observational selection effects the 300:1 ratio of main belt asteroids to active mbcs is a lower limit  the ratio could be considerably larger when averaged over the main belt as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , at face value , the estimate suggests that we should identify @xmath176 mbcs within the talcs sample since our detection techniques are sensitive to the same cometary activity levels as the known mbcs .",
    "our null result allows us to set new upper limits on the number distribution of mbcs in absolute magnitude , semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination by employing the technique of @xcite .",
    "given the false - positive rate ( @xmath177 ) , the differential absolute magnitude distribution of talcs objects , @xmath178 , the probability of detecting an active mbc within the survey ( @xmath179 ) , and the completeness of the survey as a function of absolute magnitude , @xmath180 , the actual number of mbcs as a function of absolute magnitude is given by : @xmath181 we take @xmath182 ( @xmath11/924 ) because of the one questionable detection described at the end of  [ ss.comasearchsensitivity ] though it is functionally equivalent to a zero false - positive rate .",

    "we might expect a gradient of subsurface water ice abundances across parent body sizes , local number densities , semi - major axes , etc . and , hence , varying mbc activity levels throughout the main belt . in any event ,",
    "given the lack of knowledge about the evolution of the snowline in proto - solar nebulae , attempts to identify its location or to measure the water gradient in the solar system could provide useful constraints on modelling solar system formation . perhaps the solar system maintains a record of evolutionary transitions in the proto - solar nebula as the snowline advanced further from the sun much like glacial moraines leaving permanent records of changes in climate as glaciers recede .    the ability to constrain the location of the primordial snow line in our own solar system is further complicated by recent revelations involving massive reorganization of the distribution of the small bodies during early solar system evolution .",
    "the ability to constrain the location of the snow line presupposes that the current distribution of small bodies is mostly representative of their primordial distribution .",
    "the observed taxonomic distribution of small bodies progressing from s - complex asteroids in the inner belt , to c - complex in the middle and outer belt , to d- and p - type asteroids in the hilda and jupiter trojan regions may represent a relic of their original distributions .",
    "@xcite have thrown this assumption entirely upside down in suggesting that an inward - then - outward migration of the giant planets caused planetesimals from beyond neptune s orbit to scatter into the main belt region , particularly the outer belt . in this scenario",
    "objects currently in the main belt do not represent the primordial distribution of planetesimals nor do nearby objects in semi - major axis necessarily have a common origin and formation mechanism .",

    "the customary poisson frequentist model begins with the fact that the probability of observing @xmath69 mbcs given an expected number @xmath232 is @xmath233 where in the rightmost component we have defined the survey completeness ( sensitivity ) as @xmath234 $ ] and identified @xmath235 . under the frequentist paradigm , @xmath236 , the 90% upper confidence limit on @xmath61",

    "the alternative interpretation is that we are 10% confident that mbcs represent more than 23% of asteroids but this is easily seen to be wrong because of prior knowledge from other surveys .",
    "next , the statistical implications are altered by binning the data .",
    "if we observe @xmath246 asteroids and @xmath238 mbcs we would compute @xmath247 for the entire sample , meaning that we have 10% confidence that a typical sample of asteroids contains 2.3 or more mbcs . however , if were to divide the sample into 100 semi  major axis bins of 10 asteroids",
    "each and re  apply the statistics we would assign @xmath244 to each bin .",
    "_ i.e. _ ,  that each bin of 10 asteroids has a 10% chance of containing more than 2.3 mbcs , an expected mbc count that far exceeds what was obtained when the data were contained in a single bin .",
    "both examples show the formal poissonian @xmath236 does not represent a genuine confidence limit ( in the sense of betting odds ) because we overestimate the @xmath248 probability assigned to @xmath249 . in the first case , this happens because we assign a prior probability that ignores previous knowlege . in the second case",
    "we pretend that each bin is independent when we know that a failure to find an mbc in 99 bins means it is very unlikely to find one in the @xmath250 bin .        a bayesian approach remedies at least the first flaw described above at the cost of ` contaminating ' our confidence intervals with knowledge from other surveys .",
    "indeed , the above poisson approach was simply a bayesian method with a constant prior on @xmath61 .",
    "we begin our analysis by assuming a prior for @xmath61 @xmath251^{-1 } & \\mbox{\\qquad for \\qquad } f\\in[f_0,1 ] \\\\    0                   & \\mbox{\\qquad elsewhere }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath252 is the smallest allowed value of @xmath61 and is assumed to approach @xmath253 .",
    "the @xmath254 prior is the basis of benford s law ( @xcite ) and implies that @xmath61 is equally likely to reside in each decade of magnitude within the range of interest . by allowing @xmath255",
    "we assert an initial belief that mbcs are extremely unlikely to exist .",
    "next , we modify our prior using the study of @xcite ( hence hj06 ) who found one mbc in a targeted survey of @xmath256 asteroids .",
    "bayes theorem informs us that an experimental result @xmath257 modifies our prior belief for @xmath231 according to @xmath258    here @xmath257 is an experiment consisting of an observation of some number of mbcs @xmath69 in a given sample of @xmath230 asteroids .",
    "assuming completeness or survey sensitivity @xmath234 $ ] gives the binomial probability distribution : @xmath259 where we use the notation that items after a semicolon are fixed parameters .",
    "then the probability of observing experimental result @xmath257 , or @xmath69 objects , is @xmath260 thus the posterior probability of @xmath61 given experiment @xmath257 is obtained by combining equations [ eq : bayesprior ] , [ eq : bayestheorem ] , [ eq : bayesexp ] and [ eq : bayespf ] @xmath261 where the normalization given by @xmath262 and the factorial terms have cancelled .",
    "the denominator of equation [ eq : bayespost ] is a constant normalization term and for @xmath263 we may allow it to reach the limiting value @xmath264 without encountering a singularity .    using hj06 s result of @xmath265",
    "the posterior probability is @xmath266 this probability is relatively constant for @xmath267 compared to the original divergent prior @xmath268 and we have assumed @xmath269 because the observations of hj06 are deeper than ours .",
    "this posterior is effectively the distribution of @xmath61 for objects that could have been detected by hj06 and might be detected by us after adjusting for our completeness , @xmath270 .",
    "finally , we may use @xmath271 as a bayesian prior for our talcs study where we find @xmath69 mbcs in @xmath230 asteroids : @xmath272 to compute uncertainties it is necessary to integrate @xmath273 up to the desired confidence boundary . for the case @xmath243 , equation [ eq : pfetalcs1 ]",
    "simplifies to a ratio of incomplete beta functions .",
    "although the bayesian approach addresses the problem of inconsistency with prior knowledge it does not resolve the binning difficulty .",
    "as smaller bins of new data are considered the recovered mbc fraction defaults to the bayesian prior .",
    "in fact , the absence of mbcs in neighboring bins should provide information on the number expected in a particular bin because there is no reason to believe that the bins are completely independent .",
    "for instance , we do not genuinely believe that the mbc fraction for semimajor axis @xmath274 $ ] is given by @xmath275 when we oberved zero mbcs out of a thousand asteroids at other values of @xmath22 .",
    "a correct treatment would require assigning a prior probability to the independence of the bins .",
    "because of the problems discussed above , one can not view the formal bound @xmath236 as a simple `` betting '' confidence and any interpretation of the limits must be in light of the caveats of this appendix .",
    "the simplest interpretation may be the most reliable : if we use the hj06 result as a bayesian prior and consider our sample as a whole , we arrive at @xmath276 which is identical to a single combined experiment that discovered one mbc ."
