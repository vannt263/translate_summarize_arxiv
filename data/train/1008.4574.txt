    "in many experimental situations , linear polymers are present in a disordered medium .",
    "for example , a free polymer chain inside an elastomeric network , or a dna molecule in an agarose gel .",
    "the properties of single chains in such situations have been the subject of numerous theoretical and numerical work  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the problem is of great interest in part because of its strong connection to the phenomenon of quantum mechanical localization  @xcite .",
    "the greens function for a single ideal polymer chain in a potential is mathematically identical to that of an electron in the same potential , but in imaginary time  @xcite .",
    "therefore a polymer chain is expected to collapse to a small region in space .",
    "however the presence of excluded volume of the chain prevents this from occurring .",
    "the statistics of a chain in this case was the subject much controversy .",
    "this was settled by the work of cates and ball  @xcite who showed that the statistics of a chain on an infinite lattice with frozen disorder , that is the quenched case , was identical to that of a chain with mobile defects , that is the annealed case .",
    "they showed this by dividing up the infinite lattice into large finite regions with frozen disorder .",
    "the average properties of a chain are obtained by averaging over all these large finite regions .",
    "this is equivalent to performing an annealed average .",
    "it is easy to perform the annealed average over uncorrelated random disorder and show that this has no effect of chain statistics .",
    "simulations  @xcite away from the percolation threshold bear out this prediction",
    ". work on off - lattice models of spherical obstacles show more complicated behavior , because the correlations in the disorder are no longer point - like , so this influences the conformation of a chain . for low obstacle volume fraction ,",
    "these correlations induce an effective attraction causing a decrease in chain size .",
    "as the volume fraction gets close to the percolation threshold  @xcite , the exclusion of phase space for finite lattice sizes leads to an increase in the average chain size .",
    "although chain statistics in the above situation are not affected by frozen disorder , there is another important physical quantity that does change .",
    "consider the density of monomers for a given background of disorder .",
    "if this is averaged over time , one expects that the density will fluctuate because of the fluctuations in the random potential .",
    "this problem was studied numerically by gersappe et al  @xcite in two dimensions  @xcite where it was shown this time averaged monomer density ( tamd ) obeyed multifractal statistics  @xcite over the parameter range studied .",
    "the spectrum of multifractal dimensions was computed numerically and gave strong evidence for multifractal scaling .",
    "more recently  @xcite , the properties of a polymer chain on the backbone of a percolating cluster were examined numerically at the percolation transition .",
    "they found that it exhibited multifractal properties in agreement with the theoretical work of janssen and stenull  @xcite .",
    "a measure of bond density for an ensemble of chains of varying lengths that connect two points separated by a distance @xmath0 was calculated numerically .",
    "that measure was analyzed and shown to have a spectrum of multifractal exponents .",
    "the earlier work of gersappe et al  @xcite in two dimensions claimed that multifractal statistics were true even far from the percolation transition where the disorder is dilute .",
    "in other words , the multifractal nature of polymers in disordered systems is much more general and in fact , a simpler more experimentally accessible quantity , namely the time averaged monomer density , can be used as a measure .",
    "multifractal distributions are characterized by very large fluctuations , so in this case , we expect that the tamd @xmath1 will have a probability distribution that becomes increasingly broad as the system size in increased .",
    "we also expect multifractal statistics to be present for scales less than the average radius of gyration , @xmath2 , of the chain . on larger scales ,",
    "the density fluctuations should saturate so that the distribution @xmath3 of @xmath4 should obey  @xcite @xmath5    in this paper , we study this problem in two dimensions for different amounts of disorder and show that multifractality is seen in all cases . the original work of gersappe et al only presented results for one value of disorder .",
    "next we study this system in three dimensions and show that multifractal statistics persist for this case as well .",
    "next we consider many chains at finite concentrations and demonstrate how this smooths out density fluctuations so that the statistics are no longer multifractal .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we describe the model that we will apply to study this problem . in section [ sec : singlechains2d ] we study the tamd in two dimensions .",
    "the results are similar to what was found earlier  @xcite but with much improved data providing more solid evidence for multifractality of a range of obstacle densities .",
    "section [ sec : singlechains3d ] considers the same problem in three dimensions .",
    "although box sizes are smaller , this work provides solid support for the case the tamd is also a multifractal measure in this case as well . in section [ sec : manychains3d ]",
    "this problem is analyzed for a solution of chains at finite concentration where it is clear that the system ceases to be multifractal over the scale of the radius of gyration of a chain .",
    "an interesting bimodal distribution for the distribution of the tamd is found .",
    "we consider a cubic lattice in @xmath6 and @xmath7 dimensions , with @xmath8 self avoiding walks of unit step length of @xmath9 monomers .",
    "the monomers move in a cubic box of width @xmath10 .",
    "skew boundary conditions are employed  @xcite .",
    "obstacles are randomly placed on sites which are excluded from occupation by polymer chains .",
    "we denote the average fraction of excluded sites as @xmath11 .",
    "the chains are moved using  reptation dynamics \"  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the head or chain of a chain is picked at random and an attempt is made to move it to the other end .",
    "the attempt fails if the site is occupied by a chain or an obstacle , otherwise it succeeds .",
    "after equilibrating , statistical properties of the chains are measured , such as the radius of gyration and the time averaged monomer density .    to test this method",
    ", we checked that the internal chain statistics of a single chain with random disorder were identical within statistical error to that of a self avoiding walk with no disorder .",
    "next we considered density fluctuations .",
    "moments of the normalized time averaged monomer density @xmath12 can be calculated by summing moments of the density over all lattice sites and inferring how this depends on lattice size @xmath13 the average is over different realizations of the disorder .",
    "however , it is more accurate to obtain the exponents @xmath14 by coarse graining , making use of the self - similar nature of multifractals .",
    "if we coarse grain over boxes of width @xmath15 , and define @xmath16 as the density measure coarse grained over that length scale , then it is straightforward to show that @xmath17    by analyzing how this sum depends on @xmath15 , @xmath14 can then be determined .",
    "the above model was studied for a single chain in two dimensions for different values of the disorder and chain lengths .",

    "similarly , for distances smaller than some cut - off distance @xmath25 , related to the density of obstacles , the density should become smooth so that multifractal scaling no longer applies .",
    "but over intermediate scales , as can be seen , the density appears self similar .",
    "this will be now quantified below .",
    "coarse graining of @xmath4 is done by recursive decimation of the original lattice into @xmath26 blocks .",

    "the data give strong evidence for multifractal behavior for a range of different obstacle densities .",
    "the simulation was run in three dimensions and analyzed for the possibility of multifractal scaling , following the same procedure as in two dimensions .",
    "we first plot @xmath41 as a function of the coarse grained length scale @xmath15 , as is defined in relation to eq .",
    "[ eq : coarsetaudef ] .",
    "[ fig:3dscaling ] shows the case @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . because the box size and the chain length are smaller than in two dimensions , power law scaling",
    "can only be seen over a more limited range , however , it does support the hypothesis that the tamd is multifractal . for @xmath34",
    "a slight curvature can be seen in the log - log plot which is to be expected from finite size effects .",

    "therefore is appears that in three dimensions , our simulations and analysis also support the idea that the tamd is multifractal for obstacle densities away from the percolation .",
    "the internal statistics of a self avoiding walk ( saw ) in a much larger lattice of quenched random obstacles was shown to be equivalent to that of an annealed average and hence that of a saw without disorder  @xcite .",
    "for the case of a many chain solution , extending this result is not completely straightforward .",
    "the difficulty in this case is that the polymer solution extends throughout the entire lattice .",
    "however , this problem is easily amenable to numerical simulation .",
    "various equilibrium internal averages for chains were calculated and found to be almost entirely unaffected by the disorder . as an example , we considered @xmath49 chains each of length @xmath42 with an obstacle density of @xmath45 in a box of size @xmath43 . excluding obstacles",
    ", this corresponds to a chain filling fraction of @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 in this case . in comparison",
    "@xmath52 when run with no obstacles .",
    "the difference between these two cases is less than @xmath53 .",
    "as the obstacle density approaches the percolation point , one would expect the difference between these two cases to increase due to the increasing likelihood of islands that are inaccessible , similar to the single chain case  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to internal chain statistics , such as the average radius of gyration , we expect that the tamd for the many chain case to be greatly affected by the presence of disorder , as it was for the single chain case .    for a system of chains at finite density in three dimensions , the fluctuations in chain density will be quite different than for a single chain . above the correlation length , correlations in density will decrease rapidly .",
    "therefore the distribution of the tamd is no longer expected to be multifractal over these scales .",
    "this problem was simulated using the same approach as above .",
    "the distribution of the tamd was averaged over lattice sites and different realizations of the obstacle density in three dimensions .",

    "[ fig : rhohist ] for the same system as discussed above : @xmath49 chains each of length @xmath42 with an obstacle density of @xmath45 in a box of size @xmath43 .",

    "the tamd @xmath4 was normalized so that @xmath56 .",
    "the results show that the distribution @xmath57 has two peaks .",
    "one peak is close to @xmath58 and most values of the density are clustered around that value .",
    "however , there is another peak for very small values of the obstacle density @xmath59 .",
    "the second peak is unexpected because it implies that there are intermediate values of the density that are much less probable .     for @xmath60 chains , an obstacle density of @xmath45 in three dimensions with @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "]    the same feature persists when the obstacle density @xmath61 is reduced to @xmath62 and in both cases it is clear that this second peak is not due to random statistical fluctuations .",
    "this is likely due to the presence of some particular local configurations of obstacles , for example a cul - de - sac .",
    "in this case there will be entropic exclusion of chain for such a region leading to a lower monomer density .    the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhohist ] is is not compatible with the prediction of multifractal statistics ( eq . [ eq : falpha ] ) as the distribution must be convex .",
    "in addition , the coarse graining analysis of the last two sections does not yield a spectrum of exponents .",
    "@xmath63 over the same range as fig .",
    "[ fig:3dtauq ] varies by less than @xmath64 .",
    "the lack of large fluctuations is to be expected due to the presence of a screening length .",
    "although it is likely that the tamd is multifractal below this scale , it is not possible to investigate this numerically because the accessible sizes only cover a small range in scales .",
