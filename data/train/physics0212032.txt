    "when double - stranded dna is subjected to longitudinal forces greater than about 65@xmath1 it undergoes a radical conformational change , marked by a sudden , almost twofold increase in contour length@xcite .",
    "the structural characterization of the resulting overstretched or ( `` s - state '' ) dna is complicated by the fact that techniques such as x - ray crystallography are not applicable to single molecules . in this letter , we instead characterize overstretched dna by examining its elastic constants , and to this end formulate and solve a model that synthesizes features of both the worm like chain ( wlc ) and the bragg  zimm model of the helix ",
    "coil transition in peptides .",
    "thus we model dna as consisting of two different , coexisting conformations , each with its own elastic constants .",
    "we solve this model and show that it gives a good fit to recent data on the overstretching transition in nicked , double - stranded dna . from these fits , we conclude that the bend stiffness of s - dna is intermediate between the known values for single stranded and double stranded dna .",
    "our result supports the work of lger _",
    "@xcite , who argued that s - dna has a definite helical pitch and hence is a new duplex conformation of dna .",
    "our model and solution method differ from those offered by marko @xcite , who assumes the bend stiffnesses of the two conformational states to be identical ; our analysis will show that on the contrary the stiffnesses are markedly different .",
    "the analysis of viovy and cizeau @xcite is essentially a mean - field approximation to the model we study here ; in addition , the authors did not quote any value for the s - dna bend stiffness , presumably because the experimental data available at that time did not permit such a determination .",
    "the model studied here is a continuum limit of a more general class of discrete persistent - chain models .",
    "such models give better fits to the stretching curves of _ _ single-__stranded dna than either the continuum wlc or the freely jointed chain models .",
    "details will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our model and method are also of some general interest beyond dna .",
    "for example , both can be adapted to the study of the stretching of polypeptides with a helix - coil transition .",
    "we begin by formulating a discretized form of the wlc , which we call the the `` discrete persistent chain . ''",
    "later we will introduce an ising - like variable on each chain link describing a cooperative transition from b- to s - form .",
    "the dpc models the polymer as a chain of @xmath2 segments of length @xmath3 , whose conformation is fully described by the collection of orientation vectors @xmath4 for each segment . thus the relaxed total contour length is @xmath5 .",
    "bend resistance is taken into account by including an energy penalty at each link proportional to the square of the angle @xmath6 between two adjacent links . the energy functional describing this model",

    ".    the force - extension relation can be obtained from @xmath10 by differentiating with respect to the force .",
    "it is here that the transfer matrix formulation can be used to greatly simplify the calculation of the force - extension relation , since all that is needed to compute the logarithmic derivative of @xmath10 in the limit of long chains is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath20 , which we will call @xmath21 : @xmath22    analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to add an intrinsic stretch modulus to the calculation outlined above , obtaining an `` extensible dpc '' model .",
    "to study overstretching , we now extend the extensible dpc by giving each link a discrete variable @xmath23 , which takes the values @xmath24 . we will take @xmath25 to mean the segment is in the b - state and @xmath26 for the s - state .",

    "we assign a bend stiffness parameter @xmath30 to b - dna , and a different @xmath31 to s - dna ; @xmath32 is a dimensionless parameter with @xmath33 .",

    "( [ smithfit ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "our model contains the following seven parameters .",
    "@xmath93 is the free energy per unit length required to flip b - dna into the s - state , and is measured in [ j / nm ] .",
    "@xmath94 measures the cooperativity of the transition and has units [ 1/nm ] .",
    "@xmath30 is the bend stiffness parameter of b - dna , with units [ nm ] .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 is the ratio of the b- and s - dna bend stiffnesses . @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the stretch stiffnesses of b and s - dna , and are measured in pn .",
    "finally , @xmath27 is the dimensionless elongation factor associated with the b@xmath38s transition .",
    "fig .  ( [ smithfit ] ) shows a fit to some recent experimental data ( similar data appear in @xcite ) . our model reproduces the experimental data rather well , but with so many fit parameters one may ask whether it actually makes any falsifiable predictions . to answer this question we note that the data below the transition suffice to fix @xmath30 and @xmath95 as usual , roughly speaking from the curvature and slope of the curve below the transition .",
    "similarly , the data above the transition fix @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "the vertical jump in the curve at the transition fixes @xmath27 .",
    "the horizontal location of the jump fixes @xmath79 , and the steepness of the jump fixes the cooperativity @xmath98 .",
    "should be regarded as an average of the two different costs to convert at or gc pairs .",
    "the fit value of @xmath94 has no direct microscopic significance , as the apparent cooperativity of the transition will be reduced by the sequence disorder .",
    "] thus all of the model s parameters are fixed by specific features of the data .",
    "two additional , independent features of the data now remain , namely the rounding of the curve at the start and end of the transition .",
    "our model predicts these features fairly succesfully .",
    "the fit recovers the known values for the effective persistence length of b - dna of around @xmath99 nm and its stretch modulus of about @xmath100pn .",
    "our first result is that the bend stiffness of s - dna from our fit as @xmath101 nm .",
    "similar results were obtained using the older data of cluzel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . if s - dna consisted of two unbound , single strands",
    ", we might have expected @xmath102 to be twice as large as the value @xmath103 nm appropriate to single - stranded dna ( as obtained from stretching experiments on ssdna , restricted to forces above those required to pull out secondary structure @xcite ) . on the contrary",
    ", we find that the bend stiffness of s - dna is intermediate between that of b - dna and that of two single strands .    finally , our fit gives the stretch modulus of s - dna is substantially higher than that of b - dna .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the idea that the contour length of s - dna is determined by its covalently bonded sugar - phosphate backbones , which are much straighter than in b - dna ; the contour length of b - dna is instead determined by weaker , base - stacking interactions .",
    "several authors have studied the entropic elasticity of two - state chains . as soon as the overstretching transition was discovered , cluzel proposed a pure ising model by analogy to the helix - coil transition @xcite .",
    "others then introduced entropic elasticity , but required that both states have the same bending stiffness as b - dna @xcite or took one of the two states to be infinitely stiff @xcite , or to be a fjc @xcite .",
    "also several earlier works made a mean - field approximation instead of diagonalizing the full transfer matrix .",
    "we believe our ising - dpc model to be the first consistent formulation incorporating the coexistence of two different states with arbitrary elastic constants .",
    "our approach also is calculationally more straightforward than some , and minimal in the sense that no unknown potential function needs to be chosen .",
