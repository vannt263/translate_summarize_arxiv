    "drell - yan(dy ) production of lepton pairs  @xcite from nucleons and nuclear targets is an important tool to study the quark structure of nucleons and its modification in the nuclear medium .",
    "in particular , the proton induced dy production of muon pairs on nucleons and nuclei provides a direct probe to investigate the quark parton distribution functions(pdfs ) . in a dy process(shown in fig.[fig0 ] ) , a quark of beam(target ) hadron gets annihilated from the antiquark of target(beam ) hadron and gives rise to a photon which in turn gives lepton pairs of opposite charge . the basic process is @xmath2 , where b and t indicate the beam proton and the target nucleon / hadron .",
    "a quark(antiquark ) in the beam carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 interacts with an antiquark(quark ) in the target carrying longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath4 of the target momentum per nucleon to produce a virtual photon .",
    "the cross section per target nucleon @xmath5 in the leading order is given by  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fine structure constant , @xmath8 is the charge of quark / antiquark of flavor f , @xmath9 is the photon virtuality and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the beam(target ) quark / antiquark pdfs of flavour f.    this process is directly sensitive to the antiquark parton distribution functions @xmath12 in target nuclei which has also been studied by dis experiments through the observation of emc effect .",
    "quantitatively the emc effect describes the nuclear modification of nucleon structure function @xmath13 for the bound nucleon defined as @xmath14 $ ] and gives information about the modification of the sum of quark and antiquark pdfs  @xcite which is dominated by the valence quarks in the high @xmath4 region ( @xmath15 ) . in the low @xmath4 region ( @xmath16 ) , where sea quarks are expected to give dominant contribution , the study of @xmath13 gives information about sea quark and antiquark pdfs .",
    "thus , nuclear modifications are phenomenologically incorporated in @xmath17 and @xmath18 using the experimental data on @xmath13 and are used to analyze the dy yields from nuclear targets .",
    "some authors succeed in giving a satisfactory description of dis and dy data on nuclear targets using same set of nuclear @xmath19 and @xmath12  @xcite , while some others find it difficult to provide a consistent description of dis and dy data using the same set of nuclear pdfs  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are many theoretical attempts to describe the nuclear modifications of quark and antiquark pdfs to explain dis which have also been used to understand the dy process on nuclear targets  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the known nuclear modifications discussed in literature in the case of dis are ( a ) modification of nucleon structure inside the nuclear medium , ( b ) a significantly enhanced contribution of subnucleonic degrees of freedom like pions or quark clusters in nuclei and ( c ) nuclear shadowing .",

    "experimental points are data of e772 experiment  @xcite . ]    however , in the case of dy processes there is an additional nuclear effect due to initial state interaction of beam partons with the target partons which may be present before the hard collisions of these partons giving rise to lepton pairs . as the initial beam traverses the nuclear medium it loses energy due to interaction of beam partons with nuclear constituents of the target .",
    "this can be visualized in terms of the interaction of hadrons or its constituents with the constituents of the target nucleus through various inelastic processes leading to energy loss of the interacting beam partons .",
    "this has been studied phenomenologically using available parameterization of nuclear pdfs or theoretically in models based on qcd or glauber approaches taking into account the effect of shadowing which also plays an important role in the low @xmath4 region , however , any consensus in the understanding of physics behind the beam energy loss has been lacking . in this scenario",
    "most of the calculations incorporate a phenomenological description of beam energy loss to explain the experimental data on dy yields  @xcite . in this region of @xmath4 the nuclear modification of sea quark pdf and mesonic contributions also become important . thus in this process ,",
    "main nuclear effects are due to nuclear structure , mesonic contributions and shadowing ( as in the case of dis ) with additional effect of parton energy loss in the beam parton energy due to the presence of nuclear targets .",

    "the model uses a relativistic nucleon spectral function to describe target nucleon momentum distribution incorporating fermi motion , binding energy effects and nucleon correlations in a field theoretical model .",

    "when dy process takes place in nuclei , nuclear effects appear which are generally believed to be due to + ( a ) nuclear structure effects arising from fermi motion , binding energy and nucleon correlations , + ( b ) additional contribution due to subnucleonic degrees of freedom like mesons and/or quark clusters in the nuclei , + ( c ) shadowing effect , and + ( d ) energy loss of the beam proton as it traverses the nuclear medium before producing lepton pairs .    in the case of proton",
