    "high resolution measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and chemical composition will improve our understanding of the acceleration and propagation of high energy cosmic rays . for cosmic ray particles with energies above some 100tev",
    "this becomes a challenge since all information is derived indirectly from measurements of extensive air showers .",
    "recently , several experiments reported spectral features or deviations from the smooth power law of cosmic ray energy spectrum between the knee at about 4pev and the ankle at about 4eev @xcite . in this paper we investigate the spectrum in the region from 1.58pev up to 1.26eev .",
    "we report on the measurement of the spectrum by the icetop air shower array in its 73 station configuration using the shower size for energy estimation and zenith dependence of the shower attenuation for estimating the uncertainty on flux due to primary composition . in section [ dd ]",
    "the icetop experiment and experimental data are described and simulation data are described in section [ sim ] . the reader is referred to reference @xcite for detailed technical information on the icetop detector .",
    "the main analysis will be described in section [ analysis ] .    )",
    "icetop @xcite is the surface air shower array of the icecube neutrino observatory at the geographical south pole .",
    "it is located on top of the antarctic ice sheet at an altitude of 2835 m above sea level where the measured average atmospheric depth is 692g/@xmath0 .",
    "icetop is designed to detect air showers from primary cosmic rays in the 300tev to 1eev energy range . for reference , proton",
    "primary air showers reach shower maxima around 550g/@xmath0 at 1pev and 720g/@xmath0 at 1eev @xcite .",
    "being around shower maxima is beneficial for energy resolution since shower fluctuations are smallest at shower maxima .",
    "icecube measures air showers on the surface with icetop , high energy muon bundles with the in - ice detector , and both components in coincidence provided that the air shower triggers icetop and the axis goes through the in - ice detector .",
    "the icetop array consists of 81 stations in its final configuration , covering an area of one square kilometer with an inter - station separation of 125 m on average .",
    "each station consists of two ice cherenkov tanks separated by 10 m .",
    "two digital optical modules ( dom ) @xcite are deployed per tank .",
    "each dom contains a 10 inch hamamatsu photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and electronics for signal processing and readout @xcite .",
    "the two doms in the tank operate at different pmt gains for increased dynamic range , covering signals equivalent to more than 10@xmath1 muons before saturation .",
    "an icetop station is considered triggered when a local coincidence ( lc ) condition is satisfied initiating the readout of all waveforms and the data transfer to the icecube lab ( icl ) at the surface .",
    "the lc condition requires that at least one of the high gain doms has passed the discriminator threshold and any one of the doms in the neighboring tank has a discriminator trigger within @xmath2s .",
    "dom charges are calibrated using signals from single muons and all charges are converted to the tank and dom independent unit of vertical equivalent muon ( vem ) @xcite .",
    "event triggers are formed in the icl from the signals of all doms which have transferred data .",
    "the basic icetop trigger for air shower physics is the icetop simple majority trigger ( icetopsmt ) which requires at least 6 doms to have waveforms within a sliding window of 6@xmath3s .",
    "icetopsmt trigger rate is 30hz .",
    "examples of previous analyses , using smaller icecube configurations , can be found in reference @xcite for analysis using surface detector only , and reference @xcite for coincident events that trigger both surface and deep ice strings .",
    "this analysis uses the surface detector only , and it is based on the data taken in the period from june 1 , 2010 to may 13 , 2011 when icetop consisted of 73 stations ( fig.[array ] ) forming a hexagon .",
    "the effective livetime of the dataset used is 327 days .",
    "the uncertainty on livetime is less than 0.07 days which is negligible .",
    "all events which triggered at least 5 stations were processed for final analysis .",
    "this choice of selection brings the effective threshold up to 1pev .",
    "detailed simulations were used to relate measured air shower parameters to the properties of primary cosmic rays .",
    "air showers were simulated in a wide energy range from @xmath4gev to @xmath5gev with corsika v6990 @xcite .",
    "showers above @xmath6gev were thinned @xcite to reduce computational time and storage volume .",
    "hadronic interaction models used were sibyll 2.1 @xcite for interactions with energies greater than 80gev and fluka @xcite at lower energies .",
    "a smaller set was simulated using qgsjet - ii-03 @xcite for systematic studies .",
    "corsika atmosphere 12 was used as the simulated atmospheric model which is based on the july @xmath7 , 1997 south pole atmosphere with an atmospheric overburden of 692.9@xmath8 ( 680hpa ) . the snow cover on top of the tanks used in simulation",
    "was the same as measured in february , 2010 .",
    "air showers were simulated with equal numbers of showers per @xmath9 bin where additional @xmath10 term accounts for the projected detector area .",
    "simulated zenith range was 0 to 40 degrees .",
    "four primary types ( h , he , o , fe ) were simulated with an @xmath11 differential spectrum and 42000 corsika showers per primary . during the analysis",
    ", showers are reweighted by different assumed spectra .",
    "each corsika shower was re - sampled 100 times to increase statistics .",
    "shower cores were uniformly distributed over areas larger than the detector area with an energy dependent resampling radius .",
    "resampling radii were chosen as the largest distance possible for the shower to trigger the array .",
    "the detector response was simulated using icecube software that simulates the entire hardware and data chain @xcite .",
    "interactions of charged particles with the icetop tanks were simulated using the geant4 @xcite package .",
    "the simulations of single primary elements were weighted by a power law spectrum , @xmath12 . for a mixed composition assumption we used the model from reference @xcite referred to as h4a .",
    "figure [ h4a_fr ] shows the fractional mass composition for the h4a model .",
    "the h4a model consists of five elemental groups : h , he , cno , mgsi and fe .",
    "each group has three spectral components .",
    "each spectral component is described by a power law function with an exponential cutoff that depends on magnetic rigidity .",
    "the first component represents galactic cosmic rays from supernova remnants , the second component represents cosmic rays of unknown galactic origin , while the third component represents extra - galactic cosmic rays . due to lack of simulation for mgsi group , oxygen simulations were weighted by the combined spectra of cno and mgsi groups .",
    "the icetop reconstruction algorithm @xcite uses information from individual tanks , including location , charge and pulse time . shower direction ,",
    "core location and shower size are reconstructed by fitting the measured charges with a lateral distribution function ( ldf ) and the signal times with a function describing the geometric shape of the shower front .",
    "the lateral distribution function is defined as :      where @xmath14 is the shower size or signal at a reference distance @xmath15 to the shower axis , and @xmath16 is the slope of the logarithmic ldf at @xmath15 . the shower front is described using the signal times as :        where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the signal time of the tank at position @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the position of shower core on the ground and @xmath25 is the unit vector in the direction of movement of the shower . @xmath26",
    "describes the deviation from the plane perpendicular to the shower axis containing @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "equations [ eq : ldf ] and [ eq : time ] describe the expectations for the charge and time of air shower signals .",
    "they are fitted to the measured data using a maximum likelihood method with additional terms accounting for the probability that the signal did not pass the threshold ( no - hit likelihood ) and that the signal was saturated ( saturation likelihood , not yet implemented in @xcite ) .",
    "the shower size , s@xmath27 , is defined as the fitted value of the ldf ( eq . [ eq : ldf ] ) at a reference distance of 125 m away from the shower axis .",
    "+ snow accumulates on top of icetop tanks with time , which reduces the measured signal in a tank . to correct for this reduction , the expected signal in the likelihood fitting procedure",
    "is reduced according to :      where @xmath29 is the depth of snow cover on top of the tank , @xmath30 is the measured zenith angle of the shower and @xmath31 m is the effective attenuation length of the electromagnetic component of the shower in the snow .",
