    "human behavior is profoundly affected by the influenceability of individuals and the social networks that link them together .",
    "well before the proliferation of online social networking , offline or interpersonal social networks have been acknowledged as a major factor in determining how societies move towards consensus in the adoption of ideologies , traditions and attitudes @xcite . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of social influence has been heavily studied in sociological , physics and computer science literature @xcite . in the sociological context ,",
    "work on _ diffusion of innovations _ has emphasized how individuals adopt new states in behavior , opinion or consumption through the influence of their neighbors .",
    "commonly used models for this process include the threshold model @xcite and the bass model @xcite .",
    "a key feature in both these models is that once an individual adopts the new state , his state remains unchanged at all subsequent times . while appropriate for modeling the diffusion of innovation where investment in a new idea comes at a cost , these models are less suited to studying the dynamics of competing opinions where switching one s state has little overhead .",
    "here we address the latter case . from among the vast repertoire of models in statistical physics and mathematical sociology",
    ", we focus on one which is a 2-opinion variant @xcite of the naming game ( ng ) @xcite and that we refer to as the _ binary agreement model_. the evolution of the system in this model takes place through the usual ng dynamics , wherein at each simulation time step , a randomly chosen speaker voices a random opinion from his list to a randomly chosen neighbor , designated the listener .",
    "if the listener has the spoken opinion in his list , both speaker and listener retain only that opinion , else the listener adds the spoken opinion to his list ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the order of selecting speakers and listeners is known to influence the dynamics , and we stick to choosing the speaker first , followed by the listener .",
    "it serves to point out that an important difference between the binary agreement model and the predominantly used opinion dynamics models @xcite is that an agent is allowed to possess both opinions simultaneously in the former , and this significantly alters the time required to attain consensus starting from uniform initial conditions .",
    "numerical studies in @xcite have shown that for the binary agreement model on a complete graph , starting from an initial condition where each agent randomly adopts one of the two opinions with equal probability , the system reaches consensus in time @xmath6 ( in contrast , for example , to @xmath7 for the voter model ) . here",
    "@xmath8 is the number of nodes in the network , and unit time consists of @xmath8 speaker - listener interactions .",
    "the binary agreement model is well suited to understanding how opinions , perceptions or behaviors of individuals are altered through social interactions specifically in situations where the cost associated with changing one s opinion is low @xcite , or where changes in state are not deliberate or calculated , but unconscious @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by its very definition , the binary agreement model may be applicable to situations where agents while trying to influence others , simultaneously also have a desire to reach global consensus @xcite .",
    "another merit of the binary agreement dynamics in modeling social opinion change seems worth mentioning .",
    "two state epidemic - like models of social  contagion \" ( examples in @xcite ) suffer from the drawback that the rules governing the conversion of a node from a given state to the other are not symmetric for the two states .",
    "in contrast , in the binary agreement model , both singular opinion states are treated symmetrically in their susceptibility to change .    here",
    "we study the evolution of opinions in the binary agreement model starting from an initial state where all agents adopt a given opinion @xmath9 , except for a finite fraction @xmath0 of the total number of agents who are _ committed agents _ and have state @xmath10 .",
    "committed agents , introduced previously in @xcite , are defined as nodes that can influence other nodes to alter their state through the usual prescribed rules , but which themselves are immune to influence . in the presence of committed agents adopting state @xmath10 , the only",
    "absorbing fixed point of the system is the consensus state where all influenceable nodes adopt opinion @xmath10 - the opinion of the committed agents .",
    "the question that we specifically ask is : how does the consensus time vary with the size of the committed fraction ?",
    "more generally , our work addresses the conditions under which an inflexible set of minority opinion holders can win over the rest of the population .",
    "the effect of having un - influencable agents has been considered to some extent in prior studies .",
    "biswas et al .",
    "@xcite considered for two state opinion dynamics models in one dimension , the case where some individuals are  rigid \" in both segments of the population , and studied the time evolution of the magnetization and the fraction of domain walls in the system .",
    "mobilia et .",
    "@xcite considered the case of the voter model with some fraction of spins representing  zealots \" who never change their state , and studied the magnetization distribution of the system on the complete graph , and in one and two dimensions .",
    "our study differs from these not only due to the particular model of opinion dynamics , but also in its explicit consideration of different network topologies and of finite size networks , specifically deriving how consensus times scale with network size for the particular case of the complete graph .",
    "the above mentioned studies do not explicitly consider the initial state that we care about - one where the entire minority set is un - influencable .",
    "a notable exception to the latter is the study by galam and jacobs @xcite in which the authors considered the case of  inflexibles \" in a two state model of opinion dynamics with opinion updates obeying a majority rule .",
    "while this study provides several useful insights and is certainly the seminal quantitive attempt at understanding the effect of committed minorities , its analysis is restricted to the mean - field case , and has no explicit consideration of consensus times for finite systems .",
    "we start along similar lines as @xcite by considering the case where the social network connecting agents is a complete graph with the size of the network @xmath11 .",
    "we designate the densities of uncommitted nodes in states @xmath12 as @xmath13 respectively .",
    "consequently , the density of nodes in the mixed state @xmath14 is @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is the fraction of the total number of nodes , that are committed . neglecting correlations between nodes , and fluctuations , one can write the following rate equations for the evolution of densities :    @xmath16    the terms in these equations are obtained by considering all interactions which increase ( decrease ) the density of agents in a particular state and computing the probability of that interaction occurring .",
    "table  1 lists all possible interactions . as an example , the probability of the interaction listed in row eight is equal to the probability that a node in state ab is chosen as speaker and a node in state b is chosen as listener ( @xmath17 ) times the probability that the speaker voices opinion @xmath10 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    ".shown here are the possible interactions in the binary agreement model .",
    "nodes can possess opinion @xmath10 , @xmath9 or @xmath14 , and opinion updates occur through repeated selection of speaker - listener pairs . shown in the left column",
    "are the opinions of the speaker ( first)and listener ( second ) before the interaction , and the opinion voiced by the speaker during the interaction is shown above the arrow .",
    "the column on right shows the states of the speaker - listener pair after the interaction .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ interactions ]    the fixed - point and stability analyses ( see appendix ) of these _ mean - field _ equations show that for any value of @xmath0 , the consensus state in the committed opinion ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) is a stable fixed point of the mean - field dynamics .",
    "however , below @xmath21{5+\\sqrt{24}}-1\\right)^2-\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\sqrt[3]{5-\\sqrt{24}}-1\\right)^2 $ ] , two additional fixed points appear : one of these is an unstable fixed point ( saddle point ) , whereas the second is stable and represents an _ active _ steady state where @xmath13 and @xmath22 are all non - zero ( except in the trivial case where @xmath23 ) .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows ( asterisks ) the steady state density of nodes in state @xmath9 obtained by numerically integrating the mean - field equations at different values of the committed fraction @xmath0 and with initial condition @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the stable density of @xmath9 nodes @xmath25 abruptly jumps from @xmath26 to zero at the critical committed fraction @xmath27 .",
    "a similar abrupt jump also occurs for the stable density of @xmath10 nodes from a value very close to zero below @xmath27 , to a value of @xmath28 , indicating consensus in the @xmath10 state ( not shown ) . in the study of phase transitions ,",
    "an  order parameter \" is a suitable quantity changing ( either continuously or discontinuously ) from zero to a non zero - value at the critical point .",
    "following this convention , we use @xmath25 - the density of uncommitted nodes in state @xmath9 - as the order parameter appropriate for our case , characterizing the transition from an active steady state to the absorbing consensus state .    in practice , for a complete graph of any finite size , consensus is always reached .",
    "however , we can still probe how the system evolves , conditioned on the system not having reached consensus .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows the results of simulating the binary agreement model on a complete graph for different system sizes ( solid lines ) . for @xmath3 , in each realization of agreement dynamics , neglecting the initial transient , the density of nodes in state @xmath9 , @xmath25 , fluctuates around a non - zero steady state value , until a large fluctuation causes the system to escape from this active steady state to the consensus state .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows these steady state values of @xmath25 conditioned on survival , for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "as expected , agreement of simulation results with the mean - field curve improves with increasing system size , since eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) represents the true evolution of the system in the asymptotic network size limit .",
    "accordingly the critical value of the committed fraction obtained from the mean - field equations is designated as @xmath29 , although , for brevity , we refer to it simply as @xmath27 throughout this paper .",
    "the existence of the transition as @xmath0 is varied and when the initial condition for densities is ( @xmath30 ) can be further understood by observing the motion of the fixed points in phase space .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows how the stable fixed point and the unstable fixed point move in phase space as @xmath0 is varied from @xmath31 to @xmath27 .",
    "the active steady state moves downward and right while the saddle point moves upwards and left . at the critical value @xmath27 the two meet and",
    "the only remaining stable fixed point is the consensus fixed point .",
    "a similar observation was made in the model studied in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath25 converges to @xmath32 and does not smoothly approach zero as the stable fixed point and the saddle point approach each other , explains the origin of the _ first - order _ nature of the phase transition .",

    "= 16 cm      even though consensus is always reached for finite @xmath8 , limits on computation time prohibit the investigation of the consensus time , @xmath2 , for values of @xmath0 below or very close to @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore adopt a semi - analytical approach prescribed in @xcite that allows us to estimate the consensus times for different @xmath8 for an appreciable range of @xmath0 including values below @xmath27 .",
    "we start with the master equation which describes the evolution of the probability that the network of size @xmath8 has @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) uncommited nodes in state @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 , the number of committed nodes , and by @xmath40 , the number of uncommitted nodes in state @xmath14 . @xmath41",
    "the factor of @xmath42 in the lhs comes from the fact that a transition between states takes place in an interval of time @xmath42 .",
    "the transition rates in each term are the product of two densities , which is responsible for the overall factor of @xmath43 in the rhs .",
    "the probabilities are defined over all allowed states of the system ( i.e. @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for given @xmath37 ) and the allowed transitions from any point @xmath46 in the interior of this state - space are @xmath47 .    we know from the mean field equations that in the asymptotic limit , and below a critical fraction of committed agents , there exists a stable fixed point .",
    "for finite stochastic systems , escape from this fixed point is always possible , and therefore it is termed _",
    "metastable_. for a finite system , the probability of having escaped to the metastable fixed point as a function of time is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the survival probability .",
    "the surviving fraction is constrained to be in the allowed region of @xmath50 quadrant excluding the true fixed point @xmath51 .",
    "if the number of committed agents is far lower than @xmath52 we expect that this surviving fraction will occupy configurations around the metastable fixed point , and the occupation probabilities @xmath53 will be peaked around the metastable fixed point . in systems which exhibit such long lived metastable states in addition to an absorbing fixed point , applying a quasistationary ( qs )",

( [ mastereq ] ) ) , we get : @xmath55 considering transitions from states @xmath56 and @xmath57 to the absorbing state @xmath51 , we obtain the decay rate of the survival probability @xmath58 : @xmath59 \\label{survival}\\ ] ] substituting eq .",

    "( [ tc ] ) . in order to obtain @xmath66 ( for all @xmath72 ) , we adopt the iterative procedure proposed in @xcite . following this procedure , we start with an arbitrary initial distribution @xmath73 , and obtain a new distribution using : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an arbitrary parameter , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are all obtained using the probability distribution at the current iteration , @xmath78 . with sufficient number of iterations ,",
    "this procedure is expected to converge to a distribution that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ qseq ] ) and which is thus , the desired qs distribution . in our case",

    "following the above method , we obtain the qs distribution , and consequently the mean consensus times @xmath2 for different values of committed fraction @xmath0 and system size @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows how the consensus time grows as @xmath0 is decreased beyond the asymptotic critical point @xmath27 for finite @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath81 , the growth of @xmath2 is exponential in @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , consistent with what is known regarding escape times from metastable states . for @xmath5 , the qs approximation does not reliably provide information on mean consensus times , since consensus times themselves are small and comparable to transient times required to establish a qs state .",
    "however , simulation results show that above @xmath27 the scaling of mean consensus time with @xmath8 is logarithmic ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) . a snapshot of the qs distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) near @xmath27 ( @xmath82 ) for a system of size @xmath83 shows clearly the bimodal nature of the distribution , with the two modes centered around the stable fixed point , and the consensus fixed point .",

    "next , we present simulation results for the case when the underlying network topology is chosen from an ensemble of erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs with given size @xmath8 and given average degree @xmath90 .",
    "the qualitative features of the evolution of the system in this case are the same as that of the complete graph , although the critical fraction @xmath27 displays some dependence on @xmath90 . for small @xmath90 and",
    "fixed @xmath8 , the drop in consensus times occurs slightly earlier in @xmath0 for er graphs than for a complete graph of the same size , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",

    "the difference between consensus times for a graph with average degree @xmath90 and the complete graph , @xmath91 , decays approximately as power law with increasing @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "the deviation from a perfect power law is likely due to other weaker @xmath90 dependent terms , presumably logarithmic in @xmath90 .",

    "we leave a detailed analysis of the dependence of the critical fraction @xmath27 and the consensus times @xmath2 on the average degree @xmath90 of sparse networks , for future work .",
    "in closing , we have demonstrated here the existence of a _ tipping point _ at which the initial majority opinion of a network switches quickly to that of a consistent and inflexible minority .",
    "there are several historical precedents for such events , for example , the suffragette movement in the early 20th century and the rise of the american civil - rights movement that started shortly after the size of the african - american population crossed the @xmath92 mark .",
    "such processes have received some attention in sociological literature under the term _ minority influence _ @xcite .",
    "our motivation here has been to study this process in more detail through semi - analytical methods and simulations for finite - sized and sparse networks , within the realm of a particular social influence model - the binary agreement model .",
    "there are several open questions and extensions of this work that are worth studying , in our opinion : for example , given a network with non - trivial community structure , what is the optimal scheme for selecting committed agents ( for a given committed fraction ) that would minimize consensus times , and reduce @xmath27 ? secondly , extensions of the model to include utility - driven opinion switching by agents may be useful in designing optimal incentive schemes for opinion spreading .",
