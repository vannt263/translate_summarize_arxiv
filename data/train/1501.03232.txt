    "the development of thermoelectric materials is at the forefront of the research related to energy conversion and storage . while research on thermoelectricity in bulk materials goes back to the middle of the last century  @xcite , measurements at the nanoscale ( and in particular , studies of thermoelectricity in molecular junctions )",
    "were only reported recently  @xcite .",
    "the small size of the junctions gives rise to new physical phenomena , not accessible at the macroscopic level , and which are considered promising for reaching more effective energy conversion .",
    "the thermoelectric properties of nanoscale junctions have indeed received a lot of attention in the last years , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies on thermoelectricity in nanoscale junctions make use of the macroscopic theory of thermoelectricity to asses the junction s performance .",
    "the latter is characterized by the figure of merit , a quantity exclusively defined in terms of linear response transport coefficients and thus ill - defined out of nonequilibrium . while the linear theory is reasonable in bulk material",
    ", it fails in small thermoelectric junctions which can operate in the nonlinear regime ( for instance in the resonant tunneling regime ) .",
    "this fact motivated a number of studies to consider the macroscopic efficiency of the junction as an alternative to the figure of merit to characterizes the performance of the junction @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic efficiency is the traditional thermodynamic efficiency of a heat engine defined as the fraction of average power output extracted from the heat arising from the hot source .",
    "it is well defined far from equilibrium and upper bounded by the carnot efficiency .",
    "the nonequilibrium features of the junction are not the only characteristic to be accounted for at the nanoscale . due to the small size of the system , thermal fluctuations will play a much more import role than in bulk samples , resulting in a high variability in the junction s performance .",
    "this variability requires a statistical characterization of the energy conversion which can be performed using the methods of stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such studies have been recently done for small classical energy converters  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to define the efficiency along a single realization of the operating device and to develop techniques to study its fluctuations .",
    "experimental studies of efficiency fluctuation have been very recently performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the third central feature of small thermoelectric junctions which needs to be accounted for are quantum effects . indeed , quantum coherences can significantly affect charge and energy transfers in molecular junctions as discussed theoretically in refs  @xcite and shown experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide a general method to study the performance of nanoscale thermoelectric junctions based on efficiency fluctuations .",
    "this methods accounts for the three key features characterizing small junctions , namely , the variability in performance due to fluctuations , operation modes arbitrary far from equilibrium , and quantum effects .",
    "it is based on the joint energy and particle full counting statistics ( fcs ) which we calculate within the nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) formalism .",
    "while the quantum fcs of particle currents ( e.g. electrons ) in junctions is well developed  @xcite , that of energy was mostly limited to the quantum master equation ( qme ) approach  @xcite with its known limitations  @xcite . by numerically calculating efficiency fluctuations for a set of simple models and comparing our negf results with those obtained using a qme approach",
    ", we identify the regimes where efficiency fluctuations display truly quantum features .",
    "moreover , we propose an approximate gaussian scheme enabling to estimate efficiency fluctuations solely based on experimentally measurable quantities in molecular junctions  @xcite , namely the nonequilibrium energy and matter currents and noises .    the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "after introducing the fcs of energy , work , and heat within negf in section  [ fcs ] , we consider efficiency fluctuations in section  [ efffluct ] . in section  [ numres ] , we numerically evaluate efficiency fluctuations for various models , compare our results with the qme approach and describe the approximate scheme to estimate efficiency fluctuations experimentally .",
