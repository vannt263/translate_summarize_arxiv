    "over the last few years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the investigation of metallo - dielectric photonic crystals , partially stimulated by the appearance of remarkable optical properties associated with the excitation of surface - plasmon polaritons.@xcite these are self - sustained collective excitations corresponding to fluctuations of the surface electron density.@xcite    to understand the properties of surface - plasmon polaritons , and their possible role in the optical properties of artificially structured metallo - dielectric metamaterials , we need the photonic band structure of lattices of metallic inclusions with frequency - dependent dielectric functions .",

    ", we consider the _ evolution _ of plasmon bands in a 2d square lattice made up of long metallic cylinders embedded in a homogeneous medium , as the cylinder size increases from the non - interacting limit ( small radius compared to the lattice constant ) to touching cylinders where interactions play a key role .",
    "we shall consider electromagnetic modes with the wavevector perpendicular to the cylinders , in which case the modes fall into two categories : @xmath2- ( or @xmath3- ) polarization , in which the electric field is parallel to the cylinder axis , and @xmath4- ( or @xmath5- ) polarization , in which the electric field lies in the 2d plane .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the plasmonic regime , where the radius of the cylinders is much smaller than the wavelength of the interacting electromagnetic radiation .    at long wavelengths ,",
