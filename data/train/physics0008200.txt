    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the nonlinear beam / accelerator physics problems described by some forms of vlasov - maxwell - poisson equations .",
    "such approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential equations with or without some ( functional)constraints . wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us the possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and gives for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases the maximum sparse forms .",
    "our approach in this paper is based on the variational - wavelet approach from [ 1]-[10 ] , which allows us to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities .",
    "the solution has the following multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes @xmath0 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all time / space scales .",
    "formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into the slow part @xmath1 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary",
    "n , m. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first term in the rhs of formulae ( 1 ) corresponds on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second one to detail space . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time / space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution .",
    "starting in part 2 from vlasov - maxwell - poisson equations we consider in part 3 the approach based on variational - wavelet formulation in the bases of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes .",
    "analysis based on the non - linear vlasov - maxwell - poisson equations leds to more clear understanding of the collective effects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high intensity beam propagation in periodic - focusing and uniform - focusing transport systems .",
    "we consider the following form of equations ( [ 11 ] for setup and designation ) : @xmath2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_x}-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big[k_y(s)y+\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\big]\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y }    \\big\\ } f_b(x , y , p_x , p_y , s)=0 , \\\\ & & \\big(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\big)\\psi= -\\frac{2\\pi k_b}{n_b}\\int { \\mathrm{d}}p_x { \\mathrm{d}}p_y f_b,\\\\ & & \\int{\\mathrm{d}}x{\\mathrm{d}}y{\\mathrm{d}}p_x{\\mathrm{d}}p_y f_b = n_b\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding hamiltonian for transverse single - particle motion is given by @xmath3 +      h_1(x , y , p_x , p_y , s)+\\psi(x , y , s ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is nonlinear ( polynomial / rational ) part of the full hamiltonian . in case of vlasov - maxwell - poisson system",
    "we may transform ( 2 ) into invariant form @xmath5=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the first main part of our consideration is some variational approach , which reduces initial problem to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage .",
    "multiresolution expansion is the second main part of our construction . because affine group of translation and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of increasing closed subspaces @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "the solution is parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems , one is nonlinear and the second are some linear problems , which are obtained by the method of connection coefficients ( cc)[12 ] .",
    "we use compactly supported wavelet basis .",
    "let our wavelet expansion be @xmath8 if @xmath9 for @xmath10 , then @xmath11 has an alternative expansion in terms of dilated scaling functions only @xmath12 .",
    "this is a finite wavelet expansion , it can be written solely in terms of translated scaling functions . to solve our second associated linear problem we need to evaluate derivatives of @xmath11 in terms of @xmath13",
    "let be @xmath14 .",
    "we consider computation of the wavelet - galerkin integrals .",
    "let @xmath15 be d - derivative of function @xmath11 , then we have @xmath16 , and values @xmath17 can be expanded in terms of @xmath13 @xmath18 where @xmath19 are wavelet - galerkin integrals .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 are 2-term connection coefficients . in general we need to find @xmath20 @xmath21 for quadratic nonlinearities we need to evaluate two and three connection coefficients @xmath22 according to cc method [ 12 ] we use the next construction . when @xmath23 in scaling equation is a finite even positive integer the function @xmath13 has compact support contained in @xmath24 $ ] . for a fixed triple @xmath25",
    "only some @xmath26 are nonzero : @xmath27 .",
    "there are @xmath28 such pairs @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be an m - vector , whose components are numbers @xmath31 .",
    "then we have the first reduced algebraical system : @xmath32 satisfy the system of equations",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 by moment equations we have created a system of @xmath35 equations in @xmath36 unknowns .",
    "it has rank @xmath36 and we can obtain unique solution by combination of lu decomposition and qr algorithm .",
    "the second reduced algebraical system gives us the 2-term connection coefficients ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 for nonquadratic case we have analogously additional linear problems for objects ( 9 ) .",
    "solving these linear problems we obtain the coefficients of reduced nonlinear algebraical system and after that we obtain the coefficients of wavelet expansion ( 7 ) . as a result we obtained the explicit time solution of our problem in the base of compactly supported wavelets .",
    "also in our case we need to consider the extension of this approach to the case of any type of variable coefficients ( periodic , regular or singular ) .",
    "we can produce such approach if we add in our construction additional refinement equation , which encoded all information about variable coefficients [ 13 ] .",
    "so , we need to compute only additional integrals of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 are arbitrary functions of time and trial functions @xmath41 satisfy the refinement equations : @xmath42 if we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets then only a finite number of coefficients do not vanish . to approximate the non - constant coefficients , we need choose a different refinable function @xmath43 along with some local approximation scheme @xmath44 where @xmath45 are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of @xmath46 and then replace @xmath47 in ( [ eq : var1 ] ) by @xmath48 . in particular case",
    "one can take a characteristic function and can thus approximate non - smooth coefficients locally . to guarantee sufficient accuracy of the resulting approximation to ( [ eq : var1 ] )",
    "it is important to have the flexibility of choosing @xmath43 different from @xmath49 . in the case when d is some domain , we can write @xmath50 where @xmath51 is characteristic function of d. so , if we take @xmath52 , which is again a refinable function , then the problem of computation of ( [ eq : var1 ] ) is reduced to the problem of calculation of integral @xmath53 the key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of refinement equation [ 13 ] : @xmath54 this equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigenvector .",
    "thus , the problem of extension of the case of variable coefficients are reduced to the same standard algebraical problem as in case of constant coefficients .",
    "so , the general scheme is the same one and we have only one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we can parameterize the solutions of corresponding problem in the same way .",
    "so , we use wavelet bases with their good space / time localization properties to explore the dynamics of coherent structures in spatially - extended stochastic systems . after some ansatzes , reductions and constructions",
    "we give for ( 2)-(6 ) the following representation for solutions @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are both wavelets or nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes and @xmath58 .",
