    "over the last two decades nuclear energy density functionals ( nedf ) , and structure models based on them , have become the tool of choice for the description of ground - state properties and low - energy collective excitation spectra of medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "a variety of structure phenomena have been successfully analysed using the nedf framework , from clustering in relatively light nuclei to the stability of superheavy systems , and from bulk and spectroscopic properties of stable nuclei to the physics of exotic nuclei at the particle drip lines . in nuclear structure physics",
    "no other theoretical method can achieve the same level of global precision and accuracy over the entire chart of nuclides , at a comparable computational cost .",
    "the unknown exact nuclear edf is approximated by functionals of powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities and currents , representing distributions of matter , spin , isospin , momentum and kinetic energy . a generic density functional is not necessarily related to the underlying inter - nucleon interactions and , in fact , some of the most successful functionals are entirely empirical . a major long - term goal , however , is to build a fully microscopic foundation for a universal edf framework , that is , an _ ab initio _ approach based directly on a microscopic nuclear hamiltonian that describes two - nucleon and few - body scattering and bound - state observables .",
    "important advances have been reported in the derivation of microscopic constraints on the analytical form of the functional and the values of its couplings from many - body perturbation theory starting from the underlying two- and three - nucleon interactions , as well as in establishing the connection between microscopic edf methods with _ ab initio _ many - body techniques applicable to light nuclei @xcite .",
    "an alternative and relatively simpler approach considers semi - empirical functionals that start form a microscopically motivated ansatz for the nucleonic density dependence of the energy of a system of protons and neutrons .",
    "most of the parameters of such a functional are adjusted , in a local density approximation , to reproduce a given microscopic equation of state of infinite symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and eventually neutron matter .",
    "parameters that correspond to derivative terms can be determined , in a generalised gradient approximation , from microscopic calculations of inhomogeneous or semi - infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the remaining , usually few , terms that do not contribute to the energy density at the nuclear matter level , are then adjusted to selected ground - state data of an arbitrarily large set of spherical and/or deformed nuclei .",
    "a number of semi - empirical functionals have been developed over the last decade @xcite , and very successfully applied to studies of a diversity of structure properties of the entire chart of nuclides .",
    "there are , of course , also dozens of fully phenomenological functionals and effective mean - field interactions that have been adjusted and analysed over almost forty years .",
    "most of these functionals make use of some properties of nuclear matter at saturation , such as the saturation density , binding energy at saturation , compression modulus , symmetry energy , etc . , but this input is not based on microscopic many - body calculations , rather it is empirical .",
    "all the parameters , with a possible exception of few determined by an educated guess , are usually adjusted in a least - square fit to empirical properties of nuclear matter at saturation and ground - state data of finite nuclei .",
    "a variety of skyrme , gogny , and relativistic edfs have been employed , particularly in the last decade @xcite , to explore many nuclear properties , from masses , radii and deformations , to modes of collective excitation and rotational bands , and also been used in astrophysical applications .",
    "based on these functionals , structure models have been developed that extend the framework beyond the self - consistent mean - field , and are currently employed in spectroscopic studies of excitation spectra and decay rates .",
    "one of most serious problems with the development of the nedf framework is that it is difficult to compare results obtained with different functionals , either because they significantly differ in the functional dependence on the nucleonic density , or because they include different subsets of terms of a general functional characteristic for a certain class , that is , microscopic , semi - empirical or phenomenological .",
    "ideally , model dependence could be removed by including all terms allowed by symmetries .",
    "however , available data can only constrain a relatively small subset of terms in a general expansion , and additional criteria are required for selecting the optimal energy density functional form .",
    "recently a series of studies have been initiated on uncertainty quantification and propagation of errors in nuclear density functional theory . using statistical methods and advanced computing techniques , the stability and interdependence of parameters that determine various functionals , the inherent parameter uncertainties and their propagation , and the corresponding uncertainties of predicted observables",
    "have been analysed @xcite .",
    "many new and useful results have been obtained , and some common characteristics have become apparent .",
    "nuclear energy density functionals , with typically ten or more adjustable parameters depending on the specific application , display great flexibility but essentially depend on just a few stiff parameter combinations that can be tightly constrained by the underlying microscopic theory and/or experimental observations .",
    "predicted results generally display accurate interpolations in known regions of the nuclide chart .",
    "however , predictions from various models tend to diverge when extrapolated to areas where data are insufficient .",
    "more importantly , nedfs often exhibit an exponential range of sensitivity to parameter variations , and one finds many soft linear combinations of bare model parameters that are poorly constrained by data .",
    "this characteristic , however , does not necessarily correspond to a trivial case of too many parameters adjusted to insufficient data .",
    "it might actually point to the presence of low - dimensional effective functionals associated with the few stiff parameter combinations .",
    "this general property shared by many effective macroscopic models of complex but unresolved microscopic degrees of freedom , also referred to as `` sloppines '' , occurs in many fields of science .",
    "the interesting problem of a systematic construction of reduced low - dimensional models from a complete but sloppy framework of much higher dimension has recently attracted considerable interest in diverse areas of physics , chemistry , biology , medicine , etc .",

    "work concepts from information geometry are applied to analyse sloppiness of semi - empirical nuclear energy density functionals and , in particular , a recently introduced method @xcite is employed to reduce a sloppy functional to a simpler effective functional of lower dimension in parameter space . as an illustrative example we consider the relativistic density functional dd - pc1 @xcite , which has successfully been used in studies of many nuclear properties , both at the self - consistent mean - field level , as well as a basis for recent beyond - mean - field spectroscopic calculations . the functional is introduced and briefly discussed in sec .",

    "stiff directions in the parameter space are characterised by large eigenvalues .",
    "small eigenvalues , on the other hand , refer to soft directions in the parameter space , along which @xmath9 exhibits little variation and the corresponding linear combinations of parameters display large uncertainties and , therefore , are irrelevant for the behaviour of the functional .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the hessian span ten orders of magnitude and this spectrum suggests the existence of a lower - dimensional model @xcite . to remove the irrelevant parameters and construct a simpler functional of lower dimension we employ the manifold boundary approximation method ( mbam ) @xcite .",

    "it can easily be shown that close to the best - fit point the hessian matrix @xmath6 can be approximated by the metric tensor : @xmath17 since the residuals @xmath18 vanish at the best - fit point , the second term can be neglected to a good approximation @xmath19 which means that @xmath20 .",

    "sloppy models are characterised by an exponential distribution of eigenvalues of the hessian matrix and , therefore , an exponential sensitivity to parameter combinations .",

    "as a parametrisation independent measure of sloppiness , it has been noted that model manifolds of nonlinear sloppy models have boundaries @xcite , corresponding to points on the manifold where the metric becomes singular .",
    "boundaries of model manifolds can be analysed using geodesic paths .",

    "a geodesic is defined as a curve whose tangent vectors remain parallel if they are transported along it : @xmath24 where the connection coefficients @xmath25 are defined by the relation @xmath26 the parameters corresponding to a geodesic path can be found as the solution of the second - order differential equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the connection coefficients defined in eq .",

    "we have also found that , as the sloppiness of the functional is successively reduced by eliminating soft parameter combinations , the distance in the data space between the best - fit point and the data point , measured by the square root of the cost function , increases progressively .",
    "an interesting problem , therefore , is to find the right balance between the sloppiness of the functional and the level of agreement with data obtained by optimising the parameters .",
    "as it has been shown in our illustrative example with dd - pc1 , after a certain number of mbam iterations the model becomes sensitive to parameter variations in the softest direction .",
    "even though the model manifold might still be characterised by boundaries , namely its dimension can in principle be further reduced , the resulting best - fit models do not achieve an acceptable agreement with the data point .",
    "this is quantified by a pronounced increase of the cost function @xmath30 for the optimised model with a reduced number of parameters . to construct a predictive model , therefore",
    ", it becomes more effective to include additional data in the nonlinear least - squares fit that correspond to observables @xmath62 particularly sensitive to soft directions : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the softest eigendirection in parameter space ( cf .",
    "( [ delta_chi ] ) ) .",
    "covariance analysis can then be used to identify the effect of new observables , quantify correlations between different observables predicted by the model , and estimate uncertainties of model predictions @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additional uncorrelated observables in the calculation of the cost function can reduce the sloppiness of the model by stiffening formerly soft eigendirections in the parameter space and , therefore , improve the performance of the model when extrapolated to regions of the data space not included in parameter optimisation .",
    "this study presents an exploratory analysis that has demonstrated the applicability of methods of information geometry , and the mbam in particular , to the construction and optimisation of nuclear energy density functionals .",
    "it suggests that a viable strategy is to start with a very general ansatz for the functional form of the density dependence , derived or motivated by a microscopic many - body calculation , even if the resulting functional is manifestly sloppy .",
    "the complexity and the sloppiness of the functional can then be systematically reduced , with the successively smaller set of parameters optimised to both empirical properties of nuclear matter , e.g. the eos , and to selected nuclear data .",
    "the latter will , of course , be very challenging computationally as the mbam necessitates the calculation of both first and second derivatives of observables with respect to model parameters along geodesic paths on the model manifold .",
    "the important result is that , instead of _ a priori _ deciding on the form of the functional density dependence to be used in calculations of finite nuclei , and then optimising the given set of parameters , by using the mbam it becomes possible that the data that one wishes to describe determine the form of the functional . ideally the final result should be a non - sloppy functional that contains only stiff combinations of parameters and can",
    ", therefore , be reliably extrapolated to regions where no data are available .",
