    "if dark - matter particle states are discovered at the lhc , how will the masses of these new particles be measured ? determining the mass of the dark - matter particle ( or other states which decay to dark matter ) will be difficult because we do nt expect the dark - matter particles to leave tracks or have a displaced vertex , and because we do not know the rest frame of the initial parton collision .    if one has confidence about the specific model and process responsible for the observed events , then the magnitude of the process s cross - section constrains the mass .",
    "if one does not yet know the model , then model - independent techniques will be needed to determine properties of the newly discovered particles such as couplings , spin , phases , mixing angles , and masses .",
    "proposed methods for finding the gluino phase @xcite or spin @xcite , rely on our ability to make model - independent kinematic mass measurements .",
    "thus , model determination needs a suite of model - independent tools to provide initial constraints on the mass .",

    "edges in invariant mass combinations provide information about mass differences or mass squared differences @xcite .",
    "if the hadron collider accesses many new states , then we may be able to determine the masses by combining the relationships provided by many different invariant - mass edges of a cascade decay @xcite .",
    "there is also a series of approaches called mass shell techniques ( mst ) where one uses an assumption about the topology and on - shell conditions to solve for the unknown masses .",
    "one mst variant assumes a long symmetric cascade decay chain and counts which multiplets of masses have solution to the most events @xcite , another assumes the masses in two events must be equal @xcite , and another hybrid combines a mst with the information from the many edges in cascade decays @xcite .",

    "the ` kink ' in @xmath2 can be quantified by the constrained mass variable @xmath0 that we introduced in a previous letter @xcite . even in models where new invisible particles are nearly massless ( like the gravitino studied in @xcite )",
    ", one would rather not just assume the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is needed as an input to the traditional @xmath6 analysis , without measuring it in some model independent way .",

    "our study shows that this technique rivals other invisible - particle mass determination techniques in precision and accuracy . in this paper",
    ", we provides a demonstration of the use of the variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 in lhc conditions .",

[ figeventtopology ] and the mass difference @xmath10 . to get the mass difference , we use events where @xmath9 decays into @xmath11 and two visible states via a three - body decay in which we can easily determine the mass difference from the end point of the visible - states invariant - mass distribution , @xmath12 .",
    "one might also conceive of a situation with @xmath0 supplementing an alternative technique that gives a tight constraint on the mass difference but may have multiple solutions or a weaker constraint on the mass scale @xcite@xcite . given this mass difference and enough statistics , @xmath0 s endpoint",
    "gives the mass of @xmath9 .",
    "however the main advantage of the @xmath0 method is that it does not rely simply on the position at the endpoint but it uses the additional information contained in events which lie far from the endpoint . as a result it gives",
    "a mass determination using significantly fewer events and is less sensitive to energy resolution and other errors . to illustrate the method , in this paper we study in detail the performance of the @xmath0 constrained mass variable in a specific supersymmetric model .",
    "we study events where each of the two branches have decay chains that end with a @xmath13 decaying to a @xmath14 and a pair of opposite - sign same - flavor(ossf ) leptons .",
    "thus the final states of interest contain four isolated leptons ( made up of two ossf pairs ) and missing transverse momentum .",

    "nonzero @xmath18 could be the result of initial state radiation ( isr ) or decays of heavier particles further up the decay chain .",
    "events with four leptons and missing transverse momentum have a very small standard - model background . to give a detailed illustration of the @xmath0 methods , we have chosen to analyze the benchmark point p1 from @xcite which corresponds to msugra with @xmath19 gev , @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "our susy particle spectrum was calculated with isajet @xcite version  7.63 .",
    "we stress that the analysis technique employed applies generically to models involving decays to a massive particle state that leaves the detector unnoticed .",
    "a powerful feature of the @xmath0 distribution is that , with some mild assumptions , the shape away from the endpoint can be entirely determined from the unknown mass scale and quantities that are measured .",
    "the ideal shape fit against early data therefore provides an early mass estimate for the invisible particle .",
    "this study is meant to be a guide on how to overcome difficulties in establishing and fitting the shape : difficulties from combinatoric issues , from differing energy resolutions for the leptons , hadrons , and missing transverse momentum , from backgrounds , and from large upstream transverse momentum ( utm ) .",
    "as we shall discuss , utm actually provides surprising benefits .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ secub ] , we review @xmath0 and introduce the new observation that , in addition to an event - by - event lower bound on @xmath24 , large recoil against utm enables one also to obtain an event - by - event _ upper _ bound on @xmath24 .",

    "the @xmath0 calculations depend on the mass difference , the four - momenta of the four leptons , and the missing transverse momentum .",

    "uncertainty calculations differ amongst groups , some use repeated trial with new sets of monte carlo data , and others use @xmath137 . without a direct comparison under like circumstance , the optimal method is not clear ; but it is clear that fitting the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distributions can determine the mass of invisible particles at least as well , if not better than the other known methods in both accuracy and precision .    in summary , we have developed a mass determination technique , based on the constrained transverse mass , which is able to determine the mass of a dark - matter particle state produced at the lhc in events with large missing transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath0 method , which bounds the mass from below , was supplemented by a new distribution @xmath1 which bounds the mass from above in events with large upstream transverse momentum .",

    "<S> we develop techniques to determine the mass scale of invisible particles pair - produced at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the constrained mass variable @xmath0 , which provides an event - by - event lower - bound to the mass scale given a mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> we complement this variable with a new variable @xmath1 which provides an additional _ upper _ bound to the mass scale , and demonstrate its utility with a realistic case study of a supersymmetry model . </S>",
    "<S> these variables together effectively quantify the ` kink ' in the function @xmath2 which has been proposed as a mass - determination technique for collider - produced dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of the @xmath0 method is that it does not rely simply on the position at the endpoint , but it uses the additional information contained in events which lie far from the endpoint . </S>",
    "<S> we found the mass by comparing the herwig  generated @xmath0 distribution to ideal distributions for different masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the case studied , with @xmath3 of integrated luminosity ( about @xmath4 signal events ) , the invisible particle s mass can be measured to a precision of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this technique s precision and accuracy is as good as , if not better than , the best known techniques for invisible - particle mass - determination at hadron colliders . </S>"
