    "entanglement is a physical resource that enables one to carry out classically impossible tasks such as teleportation@xcite and dense coding@xcite .",
    "as such tasks require only special entangled states to be used in their implementation , the transformation of entanglement has become a major problem that has been widely studied .",
    "entanglement purification@xcite is an example of such transformations where mixed states , which are necessarily produced by noisy quantum communication channels when the entangled particles are distributed to distant parties , are converted into pure states .",
    "the main problem in entanglement transformations is to understand the conditions and the necessary protocols of the conversion process of a given state by local quantum operations assisted with classical communication ( locc ) to another desired state .",
    "the transformations between pure bipartite - entangled states have been understood best due to the existence of the schmidt decomposition of such states .",
    "the first important result on such transformations is the pioneering work of bennett _ _ et al.__@xcite on the asymptotic transformations where multiple copies of the same state are needed to be converted , which establishes the entropy of entanglement as the sole currency of conversion .",
    "the next major step was taken by lo and popescu@xcite who laid much of the groundwork for the transformation of single copies of pure bipartite states .",
    "subsequently , nielsen@xcite discovered the rules of deterministic transformations where a simple connection between the entanglement transformations and the mathematical theory of majorization is established .",
    "based on these developments , the conditions for probabilistic transformations have also been determined@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bipartite case , schmidt decomposition is not available for multipartite entanglement between three or more particles@xcite , and hence not much is known about the transformations of such states .",
    "some general results about the transformations of multipartite pure states are given in ref . .",
    "apart from this , all known transformation rules are obtained for a restricted class of states .",
    "for example , it has been shown that if the given and desired states in question have a schmidt decomposition , then the transformation rules for bipartite states can be directly applied@xcite .",
    "there are also works focusing on states that lack a schmidt decomposition .",
    "namely , the probabilistic distillation of the tripartite ghz state@xcite and some aspects of the deterministic transformation between ghz class states@xcite of three qubits have been studied .",
    "a systematic treatment of transformations of this kind of state is the subject of this article .",
    "first , consider @xmath0 particles distributed to @xmath0 distant persons ( parties ) where @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be a state of these particles .",
    "this state can be written as a sum of product states as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are vectors in the state space of the @xmath5th particle ( but these @xmath6 vectors are not necessarily orthogonal to each other ) .",
    "the minimum possible value of the number of terms @xmath6 in that expression is called the _ tensor rank _ of the state @xmath2 .",
    "the tensor rank is sometimes also called the _ schmidt rank _ , and its base-2 logarithm gives the _",
    "schmidt measure _ of the multipartite states@xcite .",
    "the main subject of this article is states with tensor rank 2 , which will be simply called as rank 2 states . as the matrix rank of the reduced density matrices for each party is at most 2 ,",
    "these states can always be considered as states of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "they can be obtained by locc with non - zero probability from the generalized ghz state @xmath7 but note that they also contain states that can not be used to distill the ghz state , i.e. , states where some parties are unentangled from the rest , even some bipartite entangled states are also included in the set of rank 2 states .",
    "the rank 2 states can be considered as the simplest type of entangled states . since",
    "any local operation on such states produces either a rank 2 or a product state , the analysis of their transformations should be somewhat simpler than the ones on other multipartite states .",
    "since they also lack a schmidt decomposition , it will be interesting to investigate their transformations .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first , it proposes a simple parametrization of rank 2 states .",
    "this parametrization essentially does the same job that the schmidt decomposition does for the analysis of bipartite states : it simplifies the identification of states that can be converted to each other by local unitaries , an essential task in the analysis of transformations .",
    "it also simplifies the analysis and parametrization of local operations .",
    "second purpose of this article is to completely describe the deterministic transformations between truly multipartite rank 2 states .",
    "it is hoped that , the results obtained in this article will shed light on future studies on transformations between more complicated states .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : param ] , a parametrization of the rank 2 states is given and the equivalence relation under the local unitaries is described .",
    "after that , using the established parametrization of states , local quantum operations that can be carried out by each party are described and two possible parametrizations of these operations are proposed . in section [ sec : deter ] , the necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of deterministic transformations between two given multipartite states are obtained . finally , a brief conclusion is given in [ sec : conc ] .",
    "by definition , any rank-2 state @xmath2 can be expressed in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are _ normalized _ states in the hilbert space @xmath11 of the particle possessed by the party-@xmath5 , where their relative phases are adjusted suitably such that they have a real , non - negative inner product @xmath12 ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is a complex number . here @xmath15 is a normalization factor .",
    "the overall phase of the state @xmath2 can be eliminated by absorbing it into the overall phase of a pair @xmath16 for one of the parties .",
    "apart from the vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , this state depends on one complex parameter @xmath14 , and @xmath0 real parameters @xmath17 , which will simply be called as the _ cosines _ , belonging to the closed interval @xmath18 $ ] . the collection of these parameters will be denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20-tuple @xmath21 will be considered as a point in a space @xmath22 which is essentially @xmath23^p$ ]",
    ". however , there are a few adjustments to be made before defining the space @xmath22 precisely .",
    "first , if @xmath2 is a rank-2 state , then the complex number @xmath14 has to be non - zero .",
    "however , treating the product states ( i.e. , rank-1 states ) by the same parametrization has some advantages .",
    "for this reason , @xmath24 values are also included as possible values of this parameter .",
    "moreover , the value @xmath25 should also be included as a possible value for this parameter , where @xmath2 is again a product state . in other words ,",
    "the parameter @xmath14 can be chosen from the extended complex numbers @xmath26 . apart from this ,",
    "note that the point @xmath27 can not possibly be identified with a state . as a result ,",
    "this point is excluded from @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the parameter space @xmath22 is defined as @xmath28^p \\setminus \\{(-1;1,1,\\ldots,1)\\}$ ] .",
    "consequently , any rank-2 or rank-1 state can be expressed by using a point @xmath21 in so - defined space @xmath22 .",
    "it is possible to distinguish three types of states that can be represented as a point in @xmath22 .",
    "the following list describes these types and gives the necessary rules for understanding the type of the state a point @xmath29 represents .",
    "* the product states , which are included into @xmath22 for completeness due to the fact that some local operations produce them .",
    "the point @xmath21 corresponds to a product state if and only if either ( i ) @xmath24 , or ( ii ) @xmath25 , or ( iii ) the cosines of at least @xmath30 parties are @xmath31",
    ". * bipartite entangled states .",
    "a point @xmath21 is a bipartite entangled state if and only if @xmath32 and _ exactly _ @xmath33 of the cosines are @xmath31 and the remaining two cosines are strictly less than @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath21 is a bipartite state between parties @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then we should have @xmath36 . for all of these states ,",
    "the cosines can be chosen in a multitude of different ways , proving that the current parametrization is rather inconvenient for these types of states . *",
    "the rest of the states , i.e. , those that are neither product nor bipartite entangled , will be called _ truly multipartite _ states .",
    "the point @xmath21 corresponds to a truly multipartite state if and only if @xmath32 and at least three of the cosines are strictly less than @xmath31 .",
    "note that the concurrence@xcite can be used as a measure of the entanglement of a given party @xmath5 with all the other parties . when the state @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_psi_defined ] ) is considered as an entangled state between the party-@xmath5 and the rest of the parties , the related concurrence can be computed as , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the reduced density matrix for the party @xmath5 , which is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute these concurrences for the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_psi_defined ] ) as @xmath40 note that for @xmath32 , the concurrence @xmath41 can be non - zero ( and hence the party-@xmath5 is entangled with the others ) if and only if @xmath42 and there is another cosine which is less than @xmath31 . using this , all of the rules listed above can be justified easily .      next",
    ", a description of local unitary ( lu ) equivalence between states that are expressed by using the parametrization given above must be provided .",
    "two states @xmath2 and @xmath43 are called lu - equivalent , if there are local unitary operators @xmath44 on each local hilbert space @xmath11 such that @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , lu - equivalent states can be converted into each other by locc , with necessary local quantum operations being the indicated unitaries .",
    "the opposite is also true .",
    "if two states @xmath2 and @xmath43 are locc - convertible into each other , then @xmath2 and @xmath43 are lu equivalent@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that any two states described by the same parameter @xmath29 are lu - equivalent .",
    "such states differ only in the pairs of states @xmath16 which have a common inner product @xmath46 , and therefore it is possible find a unitary operator that converts such pairs into similar pairs .",
    "hence , the point @xmath29 denotes a collection states which are all lu - equivalent to the following representative state @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49    apart from this , it is possible to express the _ same _ state by using two different points of @xmath22 , say @xmath21 and @xmath50 .",
    "expressed in a different but equivalent way : there might be different points @xmath21 and @xmath50 of @xmath22 such that the representative states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are lu - equivalent .",
    "the points @xmath21 and @xmath50 will be called ( lu ) equivalent if this happens and that relation will be denoted as @xmath53 .    for any given point @xmath29 ,",
    "let us define its _ conjugate _",
    "point by @xmath54 , i.e. , point obtained by inverting the @xmath14-parameter only .",
    "it can be seen easily that @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that , if none of the cosines of @xmath21 vanish , then the equivalence class of @xmath21 is formed by the pair of points @xmath56 .",
    "precise criteria for deciding whether two given points of @xmath22 are equivalent are given below .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath57 . the rules of equivalence depend on the types of the states as follows .",
    "* if @xmath21 is product state , then @xmath53 if and only if @xmath50 is a product state . * if @xmath21 is a bipartite entangled state between party-@xmath34 and party-@xmath35 , then @xmath58 if and only if @xmath50 is also a bipartite state between the same parties and they have the same concurrences , in other words @xmath59 * if @xmath21 is truly multipartite then @xmath60 if and only if ( a ) the corresponding cosines are identical ( i.e. , @xmath61 for all @xmath5 ) and ( b ) the following condition holds for @xmath14 depending on whether there is a vanishing cosine or not : * * when no cosines vanish : either @xmath62 or @xmath63 , * * when there is a vanishing cosine : either @xmath64 or @xmath65 .    the statements for the product and bipartite states are straightforward",
    ". the last rule follows simply from the following theorem .",
    "+    _ proof : _ to simplify the proof , it can be assumed that the parties are relabelled so that the first @xmath66 sets of vectors , i.e. , @xmath67 , are linearly independent .",
    "this assumption is employed in all of the cases treated below .    for ( a ) ,",
    "suppose that there are numbers @xmath68 such that @xmath69 let @xmath70 be an arbitrary vector in the hilbert space of all parties except the @xmath31st .",
    "the inner product with this state gives @xmath71 due to linear independence of @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "as @xmath75 is arbitrary and each @xmath76 is non - zero , it necessarily follows that @xmath77 .",
    "this shows that the set of vectors @xmath78 is linearly independent .    for ( b )",
    ", suppose that @xmath79 and @xmath80 without loss of generality . the reduced density matrix for the second party is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the overlap matrix given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 . using the result in ( a )",
    ", it can be seen that the set of @xmath6-vectors @xmath85 is also linearly independent .",
    "therefore , the overlap matrix @xmath82 is strictly positive definite .    from the expression of @xmath86 , it is obvious that the support of @xmath86 is included in @xmath87 . to show that these two subspaces are identical ,",
    "let us assume the contrary .",
    "let @xmath88 be a non - zero vector in @xmath87 but orthogonal to the support of @xmath86 .",
    "then , at least one of @xmath89 is non - zero and therefore @xmath90 , which is a contradiction .",
    "this then shows that the two subspaces are identical , i.e. , @xmath91 .    for ( c ) , note that both @xmath72 and @xmath92 are linearly independent and hence by ( b ) , @xmath93 for all parties @xmath5 . in particular , @xmath94 has matrix rank @xmath6",
    "this shows that @xmath2 can not be written as a sum of product states with less than @xmath6 terms .",
    "hence , the tensor rank of @xmath2 is @xmath6 .    finally , consider the statement in part ( d ) .",
    "let @xmath95 . since the tensor rank of @xmath2 is @xmath6 , all of the vectors @xmath96 are non - zero .",
    "moreover , since the matrix rank of @xmath38 is @xmath6 for @xmath97 , the sets @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are linearly independent . in short ,",
    "the prerequisite conditions for the theorem and part ( d ) are satisfied for the new vectors @xmath96 as well .",
    "hence we have @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 and @xmath98 is also linearly independent , there is an @xmath103 invertible matrix @xmath104 such that @xmath105 inserting this into the expansions of @xmath2 we get @xmath106 using the linear independence of @xmath72 , we get @xmath107 which must hold true for all @xmath6 . in here , a rank-1 state ( product state ) is expanded as a sum of @xmath6 product states .",
    "note that @xmath99 and @xmath100 are both linearly independent and therefore part ( c ) of the current theorem can be applied to this expression .",
    "it then directly follows that only one number in the sequence @xmath108 can be non - zero ( otherwise we get a contradiction for the tensor rank of the state on the left - hand side ) .",
    "as @xmath104 is a square matrix , each row and each column contains only one non - zero entry .",
    "let @xmath109 be the permutation that gives the index of the non - zero entry for a given column .",
    "in other words , @xmath110 only for @xmath111 . then , we have @xmath112 which is what is aimed to be proved.@xmath113    at this point , let us briefly investigate the implication of the theorem for the rank-2 states .",
    "let @xmath2 be the state defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_psi_defined ] ) and suppose that @xmath32 . in this case",
    ", the conditions in the theorem are satisfied with @xmath114 . here , the statement that the set @xmath115 is linearly independent is equivalent to @xmath42 . hence , part ( c ) is the case for truly multipartite states . as a result , the expansion of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_psi_defined ] ) is unique .",
    "the most one can do in here is to exchange the places of the two terms , which essentially changes @xmath21 to @xmath116 .",
    "consequently , the cosines of individual parties do not change .",
    "the rest of the rule follows trivially .",
    "a local quantum operation ( measurement ) applied by a single party-@xmath5 can be described by the general measurement formalism , i.e. , there is a set of possible outcomes and for each outcome @xmath117 , there is an associated measurement operator @xmath118 on @xmath11 , all of which satisfy the probability - sum condition @xmath119 if the state before the operation is @xmath2 , then the outcome @xmath117 occurs with probability @xmath120 and the state collapses to @xmath121 ( up to normalization ) , where @xmath122 denotes the identity operator acting on all parties except the @xmath5th one .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to provide two alternative descriptions of the general measurement formalism that are more suitable to work with when using the @xmath22 space for state parametrization .",
    "suppose that the initial state @xmath2 is given as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_psi_defined ] ) and consider a local operation described by @xmath118 .",

    "@xmath125 is taken to be a non - negative real number and the phase @xmath126 is defined accordingly .",
    "it follows that @xmath127 by schwarz inequality .",
    "the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 are also necessarily non - negative .",
    "if the state before the operation corresponds to the point @xmath29 , then the collapsed state for the outcome @xmath117 corresponds to the point @xmath130 where @xmath131 and the probability of that outcome is given by @xmath132    hence , when describing the effect of a local operation by a single party , the values of four real parameters for each outcome are needed : @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . obviously , possible values of these parameters are restricted by the probability - sum condition ( [ eq : probabilitysumrule ] ) and the schwarz inequality , which read @xmath133 when party-@xmath5 is carrying out the operation .",
    "it appears that these are the only restrictions on these parameters . in other words , if a set of non - negative numbers @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath125 and angles @xmath126 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq : par1]-[eq : par3 ] ) , then it is possible to construct measurement operators @xmath118 on the space @xmath11 which would produce the same set of parameters . for showing this ,",
    "consider only the case where @xmath42 ( otherwise , party @xmath5 is unentangled with the remaining parties and what she does has no effect on the state ) .",
    "let @xmath134 be the dual basis in @xmath11 , which satisfy @xmath135 the associated vectors are simply given by @xmath136 next , define a new set of operators @xmath137 on @xmath11 as @xmath138 it is straightforward to show that @xmath137 is positive semidefinite ( where the inequality @xmath127 is employed ) and @xmath139 ( where the remaining restrictions , ( [ eq : par1 ] ) and ( [ eq : par2 ] ) , are employed ) . in short ,",
    "the set of operators @xmath140 forms a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "the measurement operators can be simply defined as @xmath141 .",
    "it is then easy to check that the same parameters are produced by these measurement operators .",
    "this completes the proof that one only needs to satisfy the conditions ( [ eq : par1]-[eq : par3 ] ) when employing the parametrization of local operations by party-@xmath5 .",
    "there are a number of remarks that should be made about the parametrization of local measurements described above .",
    "first , notice that this parametrization _ depends on the initial parameter point @xmath21 _ through the appearance of the cosine @xmath46 in ( [ eq : par2 ] ) .",
    "second , if an alternative , lu - equivalent point is used for the initial point , then the parametrization of the operation changes accordingly , even though it is the same operation on the same state .",
    "for example , if @xmath116 is used instead of @xmath21 , then the parameters of the operation change as @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath125 remains same so that @xmath144 .",
    "third , local operations do not change the cosines of the other parties , i.e. , if party-@xmath5 is carrying out the operation , then @xmath145 remains the same for all @xmath146 .",
    "the only changes are in the cosine of party-@xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath46 becomes @xmath125 now ) and the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "fourth , any two different outcomes that produce the same final point ( e.g. , outcomes @xmath147 with @xmath148 ) can be combined to a single outcome by choosing a new set of parameters .",
    "hence , when analyzing local operations , it can be supposed without loss of generality that different outcomes correspond to different final points of @xmath22 .",
    "however , different outcomes corresponding to different but lu - equivalent points of @xmath22 ( e.g. , outcomes @xmath147 with @xmath149 but @xmath150 ) can not in general be combined to a single outcome by a simple redefinition of local operation parameters .    finally , the special outcomes where either @xmath151 or @xmath152 produces a product state where @xmath153 is either @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "the outcomes for which @xmath156 can be simply discarded from consideration because they will always have zero probability of occurrence .",
    "a nice application of the first parametrization is the following theorem which essentially expresses the idea that any non - unitary local operation produces an outcome which is closer to the product states .",
    "+    _ proof : _ the statement in ( a ) holds trivially for the special case @xmath157 ; it also holds when the local operation is a unitary transformation or a set of random unitary transformations which never change the state parameters @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , proving ( b ) also proves ( a ) . to prove ( b ) , assume the contrary , i.e. , suppose that @xmath158 and the final cosines do not exceed @xmath46 for all outcomes ( @xmath159 for all @xmath117 ) .",
    "then , @xmath160 and , as a result , all inequalities must be equalities .",
    "namely , we should have @xmath161 when @xmath162 , @xmath163 when @xmath164 and @xmath165 from the schwarz inequality .",
    "the last relation rules out the product - state producing outcomes ( which are the cases where either @xmath151 or @xmath152 , but not both ) .",

    ", again assume the contrary and suppose @xmath167 for all outcomes @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that @xmath168 .",
    "however , @xmath169 which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore the statement in ( c ) holds.@xmath113      for the local operation described above , the restrictions ( [ eq : par1],[eq : par2 ] ) imply the following identities @xmath170 an important feature of these relations is that they are expressed entirely in terms of two real parameters ( the probability @xmath171 and the final cosine @xmath125 ) and one complex parameter ( @xmath153 ) , which are all one needs for describing the effect of the local operation .",
    "more importantly , these relations form a basis for an alternative parametrization of the local operation by party-@xmath5 . in other words , if a set of outcomes are given and for each outcome @xmath117 , two real numbers , @xmath171 and @xmath125 , and one complex number , @xmath153 , are given such that they satisfy : ( i ) @xmath172 are probabilities , ( ii ) @xmath173 and ( iii ) the relations ( [ eq : rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rel3 ] ) are satisfied , then it is possible to construct a local operation for party-@xmath5 such that the final point @xmath174 is obtained with probability @xmath171 . to prove this , we simply define @xmath175 and check that eq .",
    "( [ eq : par1]-[eq : par3 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "( the special cases @xmath176 or @xmath177 can be handled by a limiting procedure without any problem . )",
    "the second parametrization shares many features with the first .",
    "for example , it depends on the initial point @xmath21 , different outcomes corresponding to same point in @xmath22 can be combined into a single outcome , etc",
    ". however , the second parametrization is more convenient , and thus more useful because of the direct appearance of the parameters of the final states in the conditions ( [ eq : rel1]-[eq : rel3 ] ) .",
    "consider the general locc transformation by successive local operations carried out by many parties on rank 2 states .",
    "using classical communication , the parties can coordinate their actions depending on the outcomes of previous measurements .",

    "moreover , the special case where the final state @xmath50 is a bipartite state appears to be a complicated problem due to the presence of an enormous number of points in the lu - equivalence class of all bipartite states in @xmath22 .",
    "hence , in the rest of this section , it will be assumed that both of the initial and the final states are truly multipartite .",

    "whenever convenient , this freedom will be used to choose @xmath21 and @xmath50 so that their @xmath14 parameters have modulus greater than or equal to 1 .",

    "this then leads to @xmath206 .",
    "part ( a ) follows from the corollary again .    for proving sufficiency , first suppose that the first party has vanishing cosine for the initial state , i.e. , @xmath292 . in theorem 3 , it is shown that all parties except the first can increase their cosines to any desired value without changing anything else .",
    "hence , the initial state @xmath188 can be transformed into @xmath293 . at this point ,",

    "the most important of these is the existence of some invariants .",
    "many of these can be derived from the particular relation in condition ( b ) of theorem 4 .",
    "for example , the phase angle of @xmath296 modulo @xmath297 is an invariant for states having only non - zero cosines .",
    "although the deterministic transitions from a given state @xmath21 are allowed only to a restricted set of states , it might be useful to consider also the sets of states that can be transformed into @xmath21 . with this in mind",
    ", it can be seen that the set of truly multipartite states can be partitioned into various disjoint sets , between which no deterministic transformations are possible .",
    "an invariant that is capable of finely describing such a partition is given by @xmath298 for @xmath29 .",
    "the existence of such an invariant has been first discussed by spedalieri@xcite .",
    "the invariance of this quantity follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : result1 ] ) which is valid for all deterministic transformations into truly multipartite states .",
    "note that @xmath299 has the same value for all lu - equivalent truly multipartite points of @xmath22 .",
    "note also that @xmath299 takes on values in the open interval @xmath300 .    for any @xmath301 with @xmath302 , define @xmath303 to be the set of all truly multipartite @xmath21 for which @xmath304 .",
    "hence , any element of @xmath303 can only be deterministically converted _ into _ or _ from _ some element of the same set .",
    "this is the finest partition of the rank 2 states having that property .",
    "any state point @xmath21 ( or its whole lu - equivalence class ) in these sets will called as an _ ancestor _ if it can not be obtained deterministically from a different state . in that respect",
    ", the ancestors can be thought as _",
    "the most entangled _ states , meaning that there are no other candidates for being even more entangled .",
    "all states represented in @xmath303 can be obtained from one of the ancestors but it appears that some of these sets contain different lu - inequivalent ancestors .",
    "the transformations within the set @xmath305 are treated in all three of the theorems 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "this set contains the states that have either a vanishing cosine or a purely imaginary @xmath14 parameter .",
    "all states in this set can be obtained from a single ancestor , the ghz state @xmath306 , in other words states which are lu - equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ghz ] ) .",
    "an interesting special subset of @xmath305 is formed from states with non - zero cosines having a @xmath14-parameter equal to @xmath270 , i.e. , the set @xmath307 , which is defined as @xmath308 note that @xmath307 is also invariant under deterministic locc .",
    "if a state in @xmath307 is transformed deterministically to a truly multipartite state , then the final state must be in @xmath307 as well . as a result",
    ", only the cosines of the state can be increased in a deterministic transformation .",
    "it is not possible to change the @xmath14 parameter to any value other than @xmath270 .    the transformations within the sets @xmath303 for which @xmath309 are covered in theorem 4 .",

    "the ancestors are those members of @xmath303 that have a @xmath14 parameter equal to @xmath310 ( if @xmath311 ) or @xmath312 ( if @xmath313 ) .",
    "note that a given ancestor can generate through deterministic locc transformations only a subset of the points in @xmath303 .",
    "moreover , all non - ancestor states can be generated from different ancestors .",
    "hence , the partial order in @xmath303 induced by the locc - convertibility relationship is very non - trivial .",
    "all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of converting truly - multipartite rank-2 states into each other are given .",
    "the main theorems are listed under three different headings depending on whether the states have vanishing cosines or not .",
    "it is found that the multipartite states can be partitioned into disjoint subsets , which are defined by a single continuous parameter , in such a way that all deterministic transformations are allowed within each subset only .",
    "the ancestor states , which can be considered as the most entangled states for deterministic transformations , are identified .",
    "they are either the ghz state or the states that correspond to @xmath21 for which the @xmath14-parameter is @xmath277 and all cosines are non - zero .    for allowed transformations , a specific protocol for converting the initial state to the final one",
    "is also proposed . in all of the special cases",
    "investigated , the whole transformation can be divided into a series of @xmath0 successive steps .",
    "each step is associated with one of the parties and is a deterministic transformation by itself . in each step",
    ", the associated party carries out a local generalized measurement ; subsequently informs all other parties about the outcome by classical communication ; and finally , all parties apply an appropriate local unitary transformation . depending on the initial and final states , some of the parties may not need to do carry out any measurement in their steps but every party makes _ at most one _ such measurement .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the precise ordering of the parties can be changed arbitrarily ; but the individual steps of local operations may depend on the ordering .",
    "these protocols have sufficient simplicity so that a comparison to transformations of bipartite states can be made .",
    "any deterministic or probabilistic transformation between bipartite states can be carried out with a protocol where ( i ) one of the parties carries out a single general measurement , ( ii ) sends the outcome to the other party by one - way classical communication , ( iii ) and the other party subsequently carries out a local unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "it does not matter which party , the 1st or the 2nd , does the local measurement .    for the transformations of truly multipartite states , it is obvious that , in general all parties must carry out a non - trivial local measurement .",
    "for example , if the @xmath5th cosines of initial and final states are different , then party-@xmath5 must carry out a local measurement because there is no other way for changing that parameter .",
    "associated with this necessity , each party must be able to send classical information to all of the other parties for the generic case , i.e. , multi - way classical communication is also needed .",
    "hence , keeping these restrictions in mind , it can be argued that the protocols proposed in this article , which require _ at most one local operation for each party _ , are the simplest possible protocols .",
    "this feature is also present in the protocol used in ref . for the distillation of the three - partite ghz state with maximum probability .",
    "an interesting question is this : for which kind of multipartite entanglement transformations it is sufficient to carry out the conversion by at most one local operation for each party ?    there are still unsolved problems in the locc transformation of rank-2 states .",
    "one of those is the transformation into bipartite entangled states and the other is the probabilistic transformations .",
    "hopefully , the approach taken in this article , i.e. , particular @xmath22 representation of the states and the associated description of local operations will prove useful in the solution of these problems as well .",
