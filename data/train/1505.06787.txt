    "<S> entropy of all systems that we understand well is proportional to their volumes except for black holes given by their horizon area . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the microstates of any quantum theory of gravity drastically different from the ordinary matter . </S>",
    "<S> because of the assumption that black holes are the maximum entropy states there have been many conjectures that put the area , defined one way or another , as a bound on the entropy in a given region of spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> here we construct a simple model with entropy proportional to volume which exceeds the entropy of a single black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a homogeneous cosmology filled with this gas exceeds one of the tightest entropy bounds , the covariant entropy bound and discuss the implications .        </S>",
    "<S> bekenstein s discovery @xcite of black hole entropy and hawking s calculation @xcite of the temperature are among the most important clues we have on a quantum theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> these show a significant difference between the microstates of quantum gravity and ordinary matter . </S>",
    "<S> quantum field theory , the way we understand it , implies that the density of states in momentum space is proportional to the volume and so is the entropy .    the assumption , or the bias , that black holes are the highest entropy states brought about many conjectures on the maximum entropy confined in a region . </S>",
    "<S> in the absence of gravity , one can put arbitrary entropy in a region by inserting enough energy in it . </S>",
    "<S> gravity changes this picture . </S>",
    "<S> energy distorts the geometry and volume in such a way that the entropy is no longer arbitrarily large . </S>",
    "<S> bekenstein @xcite conjectured that in a system where gravity is not the dominant interaction , the entropy in a region is bounded by the entropy of a black hole of the same size . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture fails in well known examples . </S>",
    "<S> consider a cosmology with flat spatial slices and ordinary matter , like radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is proportional to the volume which grows much faster than the area and exceeds it for large enough regions . </S>",
    "<S> later , several more refined versions of this conjecture were stated @xcite that survive in more general circumstances .    </S>",
    "<S> all of these conjectures assume some constraint on the energy - momentum tensor like the weak or dominant energy conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to put any bound on entropy if one allows an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider a combination of positive and negative energy states with a zero net energy - momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these states would not have any feedback on geometry and hence , can violate any entropy bound . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in a sense , the entropy bounds are limitations on the form of energy - momentum tensor rather than restricting the entropy . putting enough restrictions on the energy - momentum tensor , one can prove some of the bounds in weak gravity limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should be cautious about putting too much constraint on the states of a theory ( quantum gravity ) that we do not understand well .    here </S>",
    "<S> we motivate a heuristic model which satisfies the dominant energy condition and breaks one of the tightest entropy bounds , the covariant ( bousso ) bound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the details and the subtleties of this model is discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let s investigate the maximum entropy one can put in a cube of size @xmath0 . as depicted in fig.[fig : entorpy ] , at small energy densities we expect a gas of relativistic particles to have the highest entropy . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the energy in the box makes it collapse into a black hole which indeed has a much higher entropy . </S>",
    "<S> can we put more entropy and energy in this box ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is yes and a simple configuration is motivated in fig.[fig : singlevslattice ] . </S>",
    "<S> each of the 27 smaller holes on the right panel have 1/9 of the area and entropy of the hole on the left .        </S>",
    "<S> hence , the net entropy of the right panel is 3 times of the single hole configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath1 holes of size @xmath2 , we get @xmath3 times more entropy than a single black hole . </S>",
    "<S> if this box is put in empty space , it is entropically favorable for the smaller ones to merge into a single black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a black hole of size @xmath4 and @xmath5 times the entropy of the original lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the whole universe is filled with this black hole lattice , there is no room for them to merge . </S>",
    "<S> it is entropically favorable to have this lattice until the universe expands enough and they can merge then .    </S>",
    "<S> we may worry that this system is completely unstable to gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> however , to surpass the single black hole entropy we do not necessarily create strong gravitational fields . </S>",
    "<S> one can build a gas of small black holes where each is well outside the schwarzschild radius of the others . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the separation between the black holes is @xmath6 times larger than their schwarzschild radius . to exceed the entropy of the single black hole configuration , we need small black holes of size @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> consider a solar system size box in which the black holes are separated by 10000 times of their horizon radius . </S>",
    "<S> we will need small black holes of size 5 meters to surpass the single black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the big separation of the black holes prevents an immediate coalescence .     contains a single black hole . </S>",
    "<S> right , the same box , filled with 27 smaller black holes of size @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined horizon area of smaller black holes is 3 times larger than the left panel.,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]   contains a single black hole . </S>",
    "<S> right , the same box , filled with 27 smaller black holes of size @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined horizon area of smaller black holes is 3 times larger than the left panel.,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]    this example shows that even using the simple ingredients of classical gravity we can get entropies larger than the one for a single black hole .    in more realistic scenarios obtained form string theory </S>",
    "<S> we replace this lattice of black holes with a set of intersecting branes . </S>",
    "<S> these branes interact with each other and have pressure and thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> let s consider a gas of these black holes with typical sizes @xmath9 and separation of the same order @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> each black hole has entropy @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 and there are @xmath12 of them in a volume @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy and entropy is given by @xmath14 eliminating @xmath9 between these two equations we get s~1r_s vg~ ( veg)^-vg ~ introducing a constant @xmath15 of order unity and rewriting in terms of energy and entropy densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 we get [ entropyformul ] s = k  . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an extensive equation for entropy . </S>",
    "<S> using the first law of thermodynamics @xmath18 we get @xmath19 this corresponds to the equation of state @xmath20 which satisfies the dominant energy condition . </S>",
    "<S> although we derived eq . using a heuristic model , this equation has been derived from many different approaches including :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> veneziano @xcite obtained it assuming that the entropy is given by the area of the apparent horizon with radius @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> banks and fishcler @xcite derived @xmath20 using coalescing horizon size black holes . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> horowitzand and polchinski @xcite derived it for a gas of string states near the point where the strings are large enough to collapse into a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> sasakura @xcite conjectured it by demanding a ` spacetime uncertainty relation ' . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> verlinde @xcite argued that a similar relation correspond to the cardy formula for the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> 6 .   brustein and veneziano @xcite obtained it by using the notion of a causal connection . </S>",
    "<S> 7 .   </S>",
    "<S> masoumi and mathur @xcite showed that eq . </S>",
    "<S> is the only entropy formula which is manifestly invariant under s and t - dualities and approaches the black hole entropy at small densities .    </S>",
    "<S> now we show that this high - entropy matter can violate one of the most beautiful entropy bounds , the covariant ( bousso ) bound . </S>",
    "<S> this bound is based on the entropy in the light sheet and has a very different philosophy and formulation . </S>",
    "<S> the question of interest in the earlier bounds was : how much is the maximum entropy one can put in a given region ? </S>",
    "<S> the answers were typically the area of that region in planck units . </S>",
    "<S> the covariant entropy bound changes the question : given a two - dimensional surface @xmath22 of area @xmath23 , what is the region which has a maximum entropy given by @xmath23 ? </S>",
    "<S> the conjecture was expressed in terms of non - expanding null geodesic congruences . </S>",
    "<S> take a bundle of null rays perpendicular to @xmath22 and follow them until they reach a caustic or start diverging . </S>",
    "<S> the region covered by this bundle is called the light - sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the conjecture expresses that the entropy of this light - sheet is bounded by @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a homogeneous cosmology with entropy density given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> exceeds this bound . </S>",
    "<S> assume a bianchi type i metric @xmath24 this is a homogenous anisotropic universe . </S>",
    "<S> the friedmann equations for this universe filled with the matter discussed in eq . </S>",
    "<S> have a power law solution in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> let s choose a surface @xmath27 in the @xmath28 plane . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath29 is the maximum entropy allowed by the covariant bound , we can show @xmath30 this ratio can get bigger than one for _ any _ value of @xmath15 if @xmath31 is close enough to one . </S>",
    "<S> for example if @xmath32 we need @xmath33 which is a mild anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio remains the same even if we do not follow the light sheet all the way to the initial singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the conditions for ordinary matter like radiation . to break the bound for radiation </S>",
    "<S> we must follow the light sheet to planckian densities where we have no good understanding .    </S>",
    "<S> here we constructed a model which violates the tightest of entropy bounds . </S>",
    "<S> there is no simple reason to assume this model is not allowed on first principles . if a shear viscosity prevents large anisotropy we may be able to find a deeper connection between the viscosity and entropy bounds . </S>",
    "<S> if this violation stands as it is , it has important consequences . the simplest would be tightening the assumptions of the area - based entropy bounds </S>",
    "<S> this would render these conjectures less useful . as mentioned above , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy bounds are really constraints on the type of matter allowed by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds would not be very impressive under too much limitation . </S>",
    "<S> a deeper consequence would be returning to the more natural bounds based on the volume instead of area . </S>",
    "<S> this will bring the number counting for the states allowed by gravity to the same footing as other quantum theories where we have a much better understanding and control . </S>"
