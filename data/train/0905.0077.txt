    "an embedded cluster is not always understood clearly because of observational constraints .",
    "the near - infrared all sky survey , two micron all sky survey , has given astronomers a chance to look into the clouds .",
    "@xcite claimed that the number of embedded clusters declines rapidly with age and the infant mortality of clusters ( i.e. , disruption not long after birth ) is more than 90% in our galaxy .",
    "galactic tidal forces , close encounters with giant molecular clouds @xcite , shock heating , and mass loss of the system by massive member stars , such as uv radiation , stellar winds , and supernova explosions @xcite , are possible disruption mechanisms for stellar groups , whether they are embedded or not .",
    "nonetheless , most of these mechanisms ( such as the first three aforementioned mechanisms ) have a destruction timescale longer than the upper limit of the lifetime of molecular clouds , which is about a few to a few tens of myr @xcite . co observations in our galaxy suggested that the lifetime of molecular clouds is of the order of 10 myr @xcite .",
    "timescale estimation of photoevaporation and statistics on the expected numbers of stars per cloud showed that giant molecular clouds of mass @xmath0 are expected to survive for about 30 myr @xcite .",
    "the most promising disruption mechanism for embedded clusters seems to be the dispersion of the parent cloud by uv radiation , stellar winds , and supernova explosions in early cluster evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they concluded that the clusters had to form with sfe @xmath1 30% in order to survive gas expulsion , and the external tidal fields have significant influences only if the ratio of half mass radius to tidal radius is larger than 0.05 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite addressed a similar problem and found that the embedded clusters would be destroyed within a few tens of myr if the `` effective star formation efficiency '' ( hereafter esfe ) @xmath2 30% .",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of embedded clusters when the parent cloud is dispersing ( i.e. , the size increases but the total mass remains constant , thus the cloud becomes more and more diluted ) . from a large survey of simulations we found that the final structure can be classified , according to the expansion ratio of @xmath3 ( the 45% lagrangian radius of the cluster ) , into three groups : ( i ) destroyed , ( ii ) loose structure , and ( iii ) compact core .",
    "empirically , the expansion ratio is related to the cluster - cloud mass ratio ( which will be defined later in this paper ) .    in this work ,",
    "we address the problem of what determines the fate of the embedded cluster .",
    "we consider that the cluster and the parent cloud could have different initial density profiles .",

    "the velocity distribution depends on the potential of the parent cloud .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) with @xcite slope from 0.3 to 30 @xmath7 is also considered , and there is no primordial mass segregation .",
    "all clusters , with the parent clouds , are required to be in virial equilibrium prior to cloud dispersion .",

    ", we define the expansion ratio of the half - mass radius @xmath20 as @xmath22 here final means 30 myr .",
    "figure  [ eps_rhm ] represents the results for the expansion ratio of @xmath20 at the end of the simulations , 30 myr , as a function of sfe in different dispersing timescales .",
    "different dispersing timescales produce different expansion ratios for the same sfe . for each dispersing timescale",
    ", there is a simple relation between @xmath12 and @xmath23 .",
    "each relation has two branches jointed by a turnover point .",
    "specifically , the turnover points for @xmath24 myr are at @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the steeper branch corresponds to destroyed clusters and the flatter branch to survived clusters .",
    "hence the sfe , @xmath12 , is a good indicator for the survivability of embedded clusters .",
    "figure  [ boundmass ] depicts the bound mass fraction as a function of sfe in different dispersing timescales ( or gas removal timescale ) . both figures",
    "[ eps_rhm ] and [ boundmass ] nicely demonstrate the expected result : a cluster might survive in a slowly dispersing cloud but might be destroyed in a fast dispersing one .",
    "the dependence of the bound mass fraction on sfe is also reported by @xcite .",
    "based on this relation , @xcite discussed the shape of the initial cluster mass function .          we suppose that it is too idealized to consider both cluster and cloud have the same initial density profile ( as in the previous section ) , and it is conceivable that they are more likely to have different initial profiles .",
    "to study the cases with different initial profiles , we fixed the plummer length scale of the cluster at 0.6 pc , but varied the plummer length scale of the cloud from four times smaller to four times larger than that of the cluster .",
    "thus , there are two parameters to describe the initial profile of the cloud : @xmath26 , its mass and the initial plummer length scale .",
    "( one can use the sfe @xmath12 and @xmath18 instead . )",
    "it is obvious that @xmath12 alone is not sufficient to describe the results with different @xmath18 and @xmath11 ( or equivalently @xmath12 , see equation  ( [ eta_definition ] ) ) .",
    "when we plot the expansion ratio @xmath23 of 20 @xmath18 cases against @xmath12 ( see figure  [ eps_rhm_eta ] ) , no discernible relation(s ) can be found .",
    "( we should point out that if we plot the result of one @xmath18 , the graph will be similar to figure  [ eps_rhm ] . )",
    "however , @xmath23 does show a `` simple relation '' with @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ eps_mb_a0 ] shows the contours of @xmath23 in the parameter space @xmath26 for the dispersing timescale @xmath27 myr .",
    "understandably , @xmath23 is large / small ( cluster is destroyed / remains intact ) when @xmath18 is small / large and @xmath11 is large / small ( or @xmath12 is small / large ) .",
    "in fact , there are three final configurations for the cluster : ( i ) destroyed , ( ii ) loose structure , and ( iii ) compact core .",
    "the boundaries between these configurations closely match the contours @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the cases with different dispersing rates ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , on the one hand for a fixed effective size of the natal cloud , it is clear that the survivability of the cluster is higher when the sfe is larger . on the other hand , for a fixed sfe ,",
    "the survivability increases when the effective size of the natal cloud increases .",
    "for example , when the cloud contains 90% of the mass of the system ( i.e. , total sfe 10% ) , the half - mass radius of the cluster expands at least twice in 30 myr .",
    "the smaller the size of natal cloud , the more the star cluster will expand .",
    "apparently , the reason is the dynamics of the cluster is dominated more by the cloud when the mass of cloud initially enclosed within the cluster is more , such as the cases of small sfe and small effective natal cloud size . and in contrast for the cases of large sfe and large effective natal cloud size , the dynamics is dominated by the cluster .    although sfe @xmath12 fails to be a good survivability indicator of the two - parameter system , we are able to identify other survivability indicators : the initial cluster - cloud mass ratio and the initial kinetic energy .",

    "we find that the initial kinetic energy is nicely correlated with the expansion ratio of half - mass radius @xmath23 , see figure  [ ki_eps ] .",
    "since the initial system is in virial equilibrium , the initial virial energy is just twice of the kinetic energy , hence it should also be a good indicator .",
    "the initial kinetic energy and the initial virial energy show how the cloud mass affect stars inside the cluster .",

    "we find that @xmath49 is also a good indicator for the level of mass segregation .",
    "figure  [ mfs_beta ] shows the mass function slope derived from within the final half density radius as a function of @xmath49 for cases with @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath49 is small ( i.e. , cloud mass is the dominant factor ) , the mass segregation of the cluster is less severe .",

    ", the broken power law observed in the arches cluster @xcite is also seen in our simulations .",
    "we note that this could also be obtained by dynamical evolution without a natal cloud ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , we can not find an obvious relation between the broken power law and sfe @xmath12 or the cluster - cloud mass ratio @xmath67 .",
    "this may be due to poor statistics in our runs ( 2500 stars initially ) .",
    "moreover , the broad distribution of the final mass function slope in figure  [ mfs_beta ] is perhaps a result of the simple single power law fitting .",

    "we studied the consequence for clusters after parent clouds disperse in different dispersing timescale , cloud mass , initial cloud length scale , and imf .",
    "we mimic cloud dispersal by increasing cloud size or length scale , but keeping the total cloud mass unchanged .",

    "it fails badly if the cluster and cloud have different density profiles .",
    "the latter cases can be described by two parameters @xmath26 , the mass of the cloud and the length scale of the plummer model .",
    "the expansion ratio of the cluster is obviously depending on the two parameters .",
    "although we can not use @xmath12 as a survival indicator , we find two quantities that can serve the same purpose .",
    "the two quantities are ( i ) the initial cluster - cloud mass ratio ( within a certain lagrangian radius of the cluster ) , @xmath37 ( see equation  ( [ beta ] ) ) , and ( ii ) the initial kinetic energy ( or virial energy ) .",
    "each of them can organize the data of itself and the expansion ratio ( of a certain lagrangian radius of the cluster ) at a dispersing timescale into a ` one - dimensional ' relation ( effectively collapsing data from a surface into a line ) .",
    "moreover , the relation is very nice in the sense that it has two branches , one corresponds to cluster destruction and the other to survival .",
    "hence the two quantities are good indicators for the survivability of embedded clusters .",
    "we should point out that for different cloud dispersing timescales we need to choose somewhat different lagrangian radius to obtain the tightest correlation between the cluster - cloud mass ratio and the expansion ratio .",
    "having said that , in fact , @xmath49 fits the data reasonably well for all different cloud dispersion rates .",
    "the tight correlation strongly suggested that the evolution of the embedded cluster depends on the total mass enclosed within the corresponding lagrangian radius of the cluster .",
    "we thus propose that the relevant ( initial ) effective timescales should be defined in terms of the total mass enclosed within the best - fit lagrangian radius ( or roughly the half - mass radius where @xmath68 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,        furthermore , for clusters with salpeter mass function , the slope of the final mass function shows a roughly linear relation with the cluster - cloud mass ratio at half - mass radius , @xmath49 , see figure  [ mfs_beta ] .",
    "in addition , all the dispersing rates we considered share the same relation .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : model ] , similar works have been done with an equal - mass model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the survivability of the clusters is only slightly higher in the cases of equal mass than cases with mass function .",
    "for comparison with the result of mass function presented here , we also did the same simulation survey for the cases of equal mass .",
    "we confirm that there is no significant difference on the total mass of escaping stars .",
    "however , the mass distributions would be different for radii larger than @xmath72 ( 70% lagrangian radius ) in these two models .",

    "<S> we are interested in three of the governing parameters of the parent cloud : ( i ) the mass , ( ii ) the size , and ( iii ) the dispersing rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the final stage of the cluster is well correlated with the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) for systems with the same cluster and cloud profile . </S>",
    "<S> we deem that the sfe alone is not enough to address systems with clouds of different sizes . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that the initial cluster - cloud mass ratio at a certain lagrangian radius , and the initial kinetic energy are better indicators for the survivability of embedded clusters . </S>"
