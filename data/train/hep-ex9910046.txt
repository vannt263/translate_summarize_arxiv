    "[ eq : amu ] , we perform a numerical integration employing the gounaris - sakurai model , with @xmath67 included , using the best fit parameters given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the externally measured quantities used to infer @xmath203 from our corrected @xmath4 mass spectrum are listed in table  [ tab : amu ] . from this procedure",
    "we obtain , prior to application of the corrections described below , @xmath204 = ( 514.8 \\pm 2.1 ) \\times 10^{-10},\\ ] ] where the error is statistical only .",
    "the advantages of this procedure relative to direct integration of the data points ( summing the histogram entries ) are ( 1 ) mitigation of the effects of statistical fluctuations particularly in the low - mass bins and ( 2 ) operational simplicity .",
    "the disadvantages include possible biases associated with choice of model .",
    "we have checked this method of integrating the functional form of @xmath205 by reproducing the cmd-2 evaluation  @xcite of @xmath206 $ ] to within @xmath207 of the value they obtained via direct integration of their data .",
    "we have also verified with our data that direct integration gives comparable results to those obtained by integrating the fit function .",
    "several corrections are needed to account for sources of isospin violation that bias the naive application of cvc .",
    "the corrections can be classified according to three quantities : ( 1 ) the magnitude of the @xmath72-@xmath78 interference arising from the isospin - violating electromagnetic decay @xmath208 ; ( 2 ) possible isospin splittings between charged and neutral @xmath72 meson masses and widths ; and ( 3 ) kinematic effects associated with the @xmath63/@xmath109 mass difference .",
    "these corrections are listed in table  [ tab : amu ] , and are described below .      to account for the absence of @xmath72-@xmath78 interference in @xmath35 data , we modify the g&s function to include it , introducing the parameter @xmath188 ( following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to quantify the @xmath78 admixture , analogous to the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 which quantify the @xmath210 and @xmath67 amplitudes relative to that of the @xmath72 meson . from fits to the @xmath1 data , we find @xmath211 . modifying our fit function in this way",
    "leads to an increase in @xmath172 by @xmath212 units .",
    "following the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the charged - neutral @xmath72 mass splitting , expected to be small , is taken to be zero .",
    "we use their evaluation  @xcite of the pole width splitting @xmath213 .",
    "the dominant source of this splitting is the @xmath214 mass difference , which gives rise to different kinematic factors for charged and neutral @xmath72 decay ( see eq .  [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "additional small differences between charged and neutral @xmath72 meson decay also affect the widths , some of which are included in the above estimate .",
    "one possibly significant difference , not accounted for here , is the effect of final state coulomb interactions in @xmath215 decay which would tend to enhance the @xmath216 width  @xcite . finally , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the charged and neutral @xmath66 and @xmath67 parameters are the same .    in determining the effect of the estimated @xmath217 on @xmath172 , we modify @xmath93 as it appears in the denominator of the expression for @xmath52 ( see , for example , eq .",
    "[ eq : bw ] ) . in the context of the k&s and g&s models , where the @xmath83 constraint is enforced",
    ", the @xmath93 factor does not appear explicitly in the numerator of the squared breit - wigner formula , unlike the general form for @xmath52 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : bw ] .",
    "modifying @xmath93 in the denominator only leads to an additive correction to @xmath172 of @xmath218 .",
    "this is contrary to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the correction is given as @xmath219 .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath214 mass difference contributes to @xmath217 through the @xmath59-wave phase space factor @xmath220 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] .",
    "this factor also characterizes the @xmath40 dependence of the @xmath72 width and affects the numerator as well as the denominator of @xmath52 in the models considered .",
    "this effect influences the spectral function strongly at low values of @xmath40 , since that is where the values of @xmath60 for charged and neutral @xmath72 meson decay differ most significantly .",
    "accounting for this difference leads to a decrease in @xmath172 by @xmath221 .          since we use external measurements to normalize our spectral function , the statistical errors considered here are those associated with the bin - by - bin fluctuations in our mass spectrum .",
    "statistical errors associated with the monte carlo based corrections for backgrounds , bin migration and acceptance also enter .",
    "we assess the overall statistical error by generating a large number of g&s parameter sets , with the parameters determined randomly about the central values returned by our nominal fit , weighted according to the covariance matrix returned by the fit , assuming gaussian errors .",
    "we determine @xmath172 separately for each parameter set . the r.m.s . of the distribution of values",
    "was found to be @xmath222 .",
    "internal systematic errors are those associated with our analysis of @xmath36 decays .",
    "they originate from the sources indicated in sec .",
    "[ s - syserr ] in the context of our fits to models of the @xmath4 mass spectrum . as with the statistical error",
    ", these errors pertain to the shape , rather than the normalization , of the spectral function .    as expected from table  [ tab : syserr ] , the dominant sources are uncertainties associated with the background subtraction and bin migration corrections .",
    "possible biases in these corrections would tend to affect the low end and @xmath72 peak regions of the mass spectrum , on which @xmath172 depends most sensitively .",
    "we have also considered energy scale and acceptance uncertainties .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainties associated with these sources , shown in table  [ tab : amu ] , in the same ways as described in sec .",
    "[ s - syserr ] .",
    "we have also estimated the bias associated with the model dependence of the approach used to compute @xmath172 .",
    "this has been done by comparing values of @xmath172 obtained with different models , as well as by directly integrating the data points .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath223 from this source . adding this in quadrature with the errors described above yields an overall internal systematic error of @xmath224 .",
    "external systematic errors are those associated with the parameters used to infer @xmath172 from our corrected @xmath225 mass spectrum .",
    "they include uncertainties associated with normalization factors , of which @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath184 , and @xmath49 contribute the dominant errors .",
    "they also include the uncertainties associated with the corrections for isospin - violating effects described in the previous section .",
    "adding the errors listed in table  [ tab : amu ] for these sources in quadrature gives an overall external systematic error of @xmath228 .      with the normalization and correction factors listed in table  [ tab : amu ] , we obtain @xmath229 & = &        ( 513.1 \\pm 2.1 \\pm 3.0 \\pm 4.5)\\times 10^{-10 }   \\nonumber",
