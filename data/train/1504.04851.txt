    "the goal of this paper is to offer some perspectives on a number of significant developments in the field of dynamic fracture that have taken place over the past decade or so .",
    "the subjects that we chose to describe are topics that we have worked on , so this paper is , by definition , quite subjective .",
    "we believe that in these chosen areas there has been significant progress  and each is interesting in its own right .",
    "we will make no attempt to present any of these subjects in depth .",
    "the idea is to present a schematic , non - technical , overview of the main discoveries and fundamental insights that have evolved from recent research in each of these different areas .",
    "many of these topics have been driven forward by new experiments that have utilized a variety of new techniques to obtain measurements that had not previously been possible . in these cases ,",
    "comparison of these experiments to the existing theoretical predictions revealed previously unappreciated gaps in our understanding .",
    "these , in turn , provided incentives to expand the theoretical framework to encompass these observations .",
    "some , but not all , of the topics addressed in this perspective piece were systematically reviewed in two relatively recent review papers @xcite .",
    "our goal here , as explained above , is different .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : eom ] we consider the equation of motion for dynamic tensile ( mode i ) cracks that has been predicted in the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) .",
    "we will describe recent experiments that have quantitatively shown that the ideas of energy balance that had been the cornerstone of dynamic fracture mechanics indeed provide an excellent quantitative description of crack dynamics as long as rapid fracture is mediated by single `` simple '' cracks ; i.e. cracks that propagate along prescribed paths and have not undergone dynamic instabilities .",
    "section  [ sec : wnfm ] considers the form of the singular fields surrounding the tips of these `` simple '' cracks .",
    "we first discuss a few rather peculiar features of the @xmath0 singular fields predicted by lefm .",
    "we then show that experiments which utilize soft materials to  slow down \" crack dynamics , making them accessible to direct measurements , revealed that the fields in the vicinity of dynamic crack tips may significantly deviate from the lefm predictions .",
    "these fields were explained by theoretically incorporating the leading nonlinear elastic behavior of the medium that becomes important at the high strains that invalidate lefm as the tip is approached .",
    "this theory also predicts the existence of a new intrinsic length scale emerging from the competition between linear and nonlinear elastic constitutive behaviors .",
    "thus , while energy balance predicts the overall dynamics of simple cracks , the structure of the elastic fields driving fracture is modified by elastic nonlinearities near the crack s tip , where linear elasticity starts to break down .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : instabilities ] we go on to consider tensile cracks that are no longer simple .",
    "this happens when simple cracks become unstable to different instabilities .",
    "we briefly mention the micro - branching instability , where frustrated microscopic branches are spawned at the crack tip , highlighting both its role in significantly limiting crack velocities and its 3d nature .",
    "we then show that when micro - branching is suppressed by approaching the 2d limit , cracks accelerate to extremely high velocities , where they become unstable to spontaneous shape oscillations at extreme velocities .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental developments have shed new light on the origin of this instability , and its relation to crack tip nonlinearities through an intrinsic length scale .",
    "the results discussed in sects .  [ sec : eom]-[sec : instabilities ] mainly focus on cracks that propagate in an effectively 2d medium .",
    "section  [ sec:3d ] discusses phenomena that entail an intrinsically 3d description of fracture dynamics .",
    "based on very recent experiments , we provide additional insight into the properties and origin of the micro - branching instability and provide evidence that it is related to the oscillatory instability .",
    "we then briefly discuss both in - plane and out - of - plane crack front dynamics .    while sects .",
    "[ sec : eom]-[sec:3d ] consider cracks that are ostensibly tensile in nature , sect .",
    "[ sec : friction ] briefly reviews studies that reveal relations between frictional motion and dynamic shear ( mode ii ) cracks .",
    "experiments over the last decade or so have revealed tight connections between interfacial friction dynamics and crack - like ruptures that appear similar to earthquakes along natural faults .",
    "recent experiments , moreover , suggest that at least some of these can be described with classical mode ii crack solutions .",
    "understanding others requires richer coupling of bulk elasticity to constitutive descriptions of friction .",
    "we conclude with some opinions on various directions in which the field of dynamic fracture may evolve in the future .",
    "what are `` simple '' cracks ? let us define a simple crack as a single crack that propagates along a single ( straight ) fracture plane  @xcite .",
    "a simple crack is , basically , a crack that does not undergo any path instabilities .",
    "how is the motion of such cracks described ?",
    "the equation of motion for simple cracks is based on the principle of energy balance @xcite ; the energy release rate @xmath1 ( the elastic energy released per unit crack surface ) is balanced by the fracture energy @xmath2 ( the energy dissipation per unit crack surface ) .",
    "as long as the surrounding material is elastic , @xmath2 represents all of the energy dissipated by a crack . for brittle materials , the `` small scale yielding ''",
    "assumption is valid ; all of the dissipative processes are encompassed in a sufficiently small region surrounding the crack tip @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is , in general , a material function that may depend on the crack velocity , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "its @xmath4-dependence is often unknown , but in some cases can be measured  @xcite .    the other  leg \" of the energy balance equation",
    "is the energy release rate , @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is a property of the elastodynamic solution of a moving crack and can be obtained by the j - integral for steady - state cracks or more generally by the dynamic stress intensity factor . within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) ,",
    "the near tip stress @xmath5 ( as well as displacement gradient ) fields are characterized by a universal singularity , @xmath6 , where the intensity of the singularity is quantified by the stress intensity factors @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 corresponds to mode i fracture , i.e. tensile cracks , and @xmath9 corresponds to mode ii fracture , i.e. shear cracks .",
    "the stress intensity factors depend on the loading configuration and geometry of a given fracture problem .",
    "once they are known , the energy release rate @xmath1 can be readily calculated .",
    "the equation of motion for a straight crack is then given by @xmath10 .",
    "next , we briefly discuss two such equations , which were quantitatively tested in recent experiments .    the most well - known equation of motion was obtained for a finite crack propagating in an infinite medium . in this case",
    ", the equation takes the form  @xcite @xmath11 where a pre - factor of order unity was omitted . here",
    "@xmath12 is the crack length ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the externally imposed tensile stress far from the crack , @xmath15 is young s modulus and @xmath16 is the rayleigh wave - speed . once @xmath3 is known , eq .",
    "is a first - order nonlinear evolution equation for @xmath17 .",
    "it is valid as long as `` small scale yielding '' conditions prevail ( i.e. linear elasticity is valid everywhere except for a small region near the tip , the so - called process zone ) .",
    "additionally , the externally applied stresses should be able to be mapped to tractions applied to the crack faces and the crack can not interact with the external boundaries ( i.e. it propagates in an effectively unbounded medium ) .    the most interesting properties of eq .",
    "are that the crack tip dynamics are not inertial , i.e. the tip behaves as a massless `` particle '' where the acceleration @xmath18 plays no role ( of course _ material _ inertia is essential for this equation to hold ) , and that the limiting propagation velocity is @xmath16 .",
    "the equation has been shown to beautifully describe crack s motion when its underlying assumptions are met @xcite . in particular , this description was shown to be valid in experiments in the brittle acrylic , pmma , for @xmath19 ( when cracks are indeed simple )  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments showed the equation of motion to be in excellent quantitative agreement with measurements of dynamic cracks in brittle gels for an unprecedented range of velocities , @xmath20 , approaching the limiting velocity  @xcite .",
    "this wide velocity range was only accomplished by suppressing crack instabilities .",
    "this excellent agreement with theory , presented in fig .",
    "[ equmotion ] , was obtained entirely from first principles with no adjustable parameters .     as a function of the crack length @xmath12 ( circles ) compared to the lefm predictions in eq .",
    "( solid lines ) , for various values of the far field tensile stress @xmath21kpa ( top to bottom ) .",
    "all measurements are for single cracks propagating in effectively `` infinite medium '' conditions ( @xmath22 mm ) . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "less known is an equation of motion for simple cracks which is valid when the crack `` knows '' about the external boundaries . while energy balance is always respected , eq .",
    "was derived for an system of infinite extent and , therefore , does not account for energy reflected back to the crack from external boundaries .",
    "when the waves that the crack emits during propagation are reflected back from the outer boundaries , the crack s dynamics may undergo a qualitative change .",
    "let us consider the important particular case of a crack propagating in a long strip of width @xmath23 which is loaded uniaxially by fixed tensile displacements . when the crack is sufficiently long , @xmath24 , there is a fixed amount of strain energy per unit area @xmath25 stored way ahead of the tip and no stored energy well behind the tip .",
    "consequently , under steady state conditions the crack velocity is simply determined by @xmath26 .",
    "marder derived the crack evolution approaching this steady state to leading order in the dimensionless acceleration @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dilatational wave - speed @xcite .",
    "in this case , the crack length plays no role ( the relevant length scale is @xmath29 , not @xmath12 ) , but the acceleration ( which quantifies the deviation from steady state ) is the relevant dynamical quantity .",
    "it is worth noting that this acceleration dependence is entirely due to the crack s interaction with the system boundaries and not to , for example , large acceleration corrections to the stress fields predicted for rapidly accelerating cracks in an infinite system @xcite .",
    "this ( little known ) equation of motion takes the form @xcite @xmath30 \\ .\\ ] ]    this equation is qualitatively different from eq .   in one major aspect :",
    "the crack tip dynamics are effectively inertial , involving acceleration and an `` effective mass '' proportional to @xmath31 , rather than being `` massless '' as in eq .  .",
    "these effective inertial dynamics are inherited from the interaction of the crack with the strip boundaries ( and hence with its own history , giving rise to `` memory '' ) .",
    "since @xmath25 is externally controlled and @xmath3 is a bounded material function ( attaining a finite value as @xmath32 ) , one can impose @xmath33 . in this case ,",
    "the divergence of the effective mass proportional to @xmath31 as @xmath32 ensures that @xmath16 is still the limiting velocity as in eq .",
    "( here @xmath34 such that @xmath35 remains finite as @xmath32 ) .",
    "the predictions of eqs .  - can be tested in a single experiment involving a long strip under fixed displacement boundary conditions . for short times and @xmath36",
    ", we expect eq .   to be valid , while for longer times and @xmath37 , we expect eq .   to be valid , with some crossover in between . a comparison to such an experiment , shown in fig .",
    "[ stripcompare ] , demonstrates that both eqs .  -",
    "are quantitatively correct when valid and that the transition between them is rather sharp .",
    "mm ( circles ) compared to the lefm prediction for an infinite medium ( small @xmath17 ) , eq .",
    "( red line ) , and to the lefm prediction for an infinite strip ( large @xmath17 ) , eq .",
    "( black line ) .",
    "the rather sharp transition between the two regimes occurs at @xmath38 ( @xmath29 is the half - width of the strip and @xmath39 is the shear wave - speed ) , when reflected waves from the vertical boundaries interact with the crack tip .",
    "adapted from @xcite . ]    therefore , while for many the equation of motion described by eq .",
    "is unjustifiably thought to be universal , eq .   explicitly demonstrates that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , we fully expect that the qualitative dynamics which are inherent in eq .",
    "are in many ways general .",
    "if , for whatever reason , a crack is allowed to interact with its past history , we should expect strong memory , inertial - like , effects .",
    "examples where such interactions may occur are when a crack tip / front encounters a localized inhomogeneity or obstacle in its path . in such cases ,",
    "when the translation invariance along the singular crack front  the crack s leading _ edge _ in 3d  is broken , it has been shown that waves will propagate along the crack s front @xcite .",
    "these waves , which transfer energy between different points along the crack front , may influence crack dynamics in much the way that the reflected waves that lead to eq .   impart a crack with inertia .",
    "moreover , experiments have shown that the crack front indeed retains a memory of an obstacle after it has passed it ; damped oscillations of the front are observed immediately in the wake of a localized obstacle  @xcite .",
    "these issues will be briefly discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:3d ] .",
    "the equations of motion for simple cracks , which were discussed above , are based on energy balance .",
    "we would like now to consider the actual fields that mediate the transport of energy to the crack tip region and may control the fracture process itself .",
    "lefm predicts that sufficiently close to the crack tip the stress field features a universal square - root singularity , @xmath40 , where the pre - factor incorporates a universal tensorial function of the angle @xmath41 and the propagation velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath42 and @xmath41 are polar coordinates co - moving with the tip ) , and the scalar multipliers  the stress intensity factors . due to linearity ,",
    "the displacement gradients feature the same singularity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the linear elastic displacement field .",
    "the lefm fields possess certain peculiar features that are worthwhile noting .",
    "for example , in mode i ( tensile ) fracture , the crack parallel component of the stress tensor ahead of the tip , @xmath45 , is _ larger _ than the tensile component @xmath46 for every finite crack velocity @xmath47   @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath48 diverges as @xmath32 .",
    "this feature implies that it is not easy to explain why mode i cracks propagate perpendicularly to the tensile loading ( @xmath49 ) axis based on the lefm universal fields . while this feature has been recognized in the past , it has not received much attention .",
    "a corollary of this is that there always exists a crack propagation velocity @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "( 49 ) in  @xcite and note that @xmath39 is the shear wave - speed ) above which @xmath51 becomes _ negative_. that is , the universal lefm fields predict that tensile cracks , which ultimately involve extending  and eventually breaking  bonds ahead of their tips , propagate with a predominantly compressive displacement gradient ahead of their tip @xcite .",
    "these features suggest that the lefm universal fields are insufficient to fully explain the fracture process , which is supported by explicit measurements of the strain fields surrounding dynamic cracks  @xcite .",
    "this by no means implies that lefm is wrong , this theory accurately predicts the flux of energy into the tip region and the universal lefm fields pose the proper boundary conditions on any inner problem which is defined inside the process zone .",
    "it does imply , though , that the _ length scale _ at which these fields are valid is quite distinct from the scale where fracture actually takes place .",
    "lefm , however , is a scale - free theory that provides no specific information about where it is valid and on what length scale it breaks down .",
    "this issue of the absence of an intrinsic length scale may have serious consequences in the context of dynamic instabilities , as will be discussed below .",
    "recently , these issues have been addressed in the framework of the  weakly nonlinear theory of fracture \" @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on a general expansion of the strain energy functional @xmath52 in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] is the nonlinear green - lagrange strain tensor @xcite and @xmath55 is the displacement field . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the standard lam ( second order ) constants and @xmath58 are the third order elastic constants  @xcite , which are basic physical quantities that are related to the leading anharmonic contributions to the interatomic interaction potential . the third order elastic constants are not free parameters , but rather quantities that are either calculated from a fully nonlinear elastic energy functional , if known , or measured directly in experiments @xcite .    as is evident from eq .",
    ", the weakly nonlinear theory takes into account the leading elastic nonlinearities when lefm breaks down .",
    "the basic idea is that in the presence of the intense displacement gradients near crack tips in brittle materials , linear elasticity first gives way to nonlinear elasticity , rather than to dissipation . as such",
    ", it is an asymptotic ( in space , where lefm breaks down near the tip of a crack ) and perturbative ( in the magnitude of displacement gradients ) theory based on the expansion @xmath59 , where the superscripts denote different orders in the displacement gradients .",
    "@xmath44 simply corresponds to lefm and @xmath60 satisfies a new equation that depends both on the nonlinearity and @xmath44 .",
    "the solution to this equation takes the form ( see details in @xcite ) @xmath61 , \\quad u_y^{(2 ) } \\sim \\frac{k_{i , ii}^2}{\\mu^2 } f_y^{i , ii}(\\theta , v ) \\label{wnfm}\\ ] ] and is inherently mode i ( tensile ) for @xmath44 corresponding to _ both _",
    "mode i _ and _ mode ii . that is , the explicitly calculable functions @xmath62 satisfy @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath42 inside @xmath65 in eq .   should be made non - dimensional , but",
    "this simply adds a constant and is not included here .    the theory , as is clearly observed in eq .  , predicts a stronger than @xmath66 divergence of the displacement gradient tensor field , @xmath67 , and a logarithmic stretching of the crack tip opening displacement , which is strictly parabolic in lefm  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath68 displacement gradient singularity has a fundamentally different status compared to apparently similar singularities in lefm @xcite .",
    "in particular , its contribution to the j - integral vanishes identically .",
    "this , and other properties , are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "these predictions were quantitatively verified by direct experiments on rapid cracks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wnfm ] .",
    "in particular , it is explicitly shown ( panel b ) that for a propagation velocity for which lefm predicts a negative displacement gradient @xmath69 near the tip ( i.e. @xmath70 , where in this case @xmath71 ) , both the experimentally observed and theoretically predicted @xmath72 are positive , the latter _ directly _ due to the nonlinear contribution @xmath73 .    -component of the displacement gradient tensor @xmath74 ahead of a crack propagating at @xmath75 ( circles ) compared to the lefm prediction ( dashed line ) and the weakly nonlinear theory prediction ( lefm supplemented with eq .  ) ( b ) the same for @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : wnfm]b ) .",
    "the latter at least recovers the basic physical intuition that mode i fracture occurs under extensional deformation ahead of the propagating tip .",
    "as was mentioned above , when nonlinearities are taken into account for mode ii cracks @xcite , a symmetry - breaking effect in which lefm mode ii ( shear ) cracks feature mode i ( tensile ) properties naturally emerges in this theoretical framework  @xcite .    as the weakly nonlinear theory features two different singularities associated with two different constitutive relations , it predicts the existence of a new intrinsic ( i.e. non - geometric ) length scale , @xmath85 , which characterizes the scale at which the two singular solutions are comparable in magnitude , i.e. roughly when @xmath86 .",
    "this intrinsic length scale is a dynamic quantity ( i.e. it exhibits a non - trivial velocity dependence ) that depends on the third order elastic constants .",
    "its length dimension is inherited from @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 , with a nontrivial and not necessarily order unity pre - factor .",
    "finally , we note that very recently an extended finite element method ( xfem ) analysis of nonlinear fracture problems based on the weakly nonlinear theory has been performed  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that using the analytic properties of the solution in eq .",
    "to construct crack tip enrichment functions provides an accurate and efficient tool for solving finite strain fracture problems .    the weakly nonlinear theory of fracture , which invokes three directly measurable third order elastic constants , provides a general and systematic way to go beyond lefm at smaller scales near the tip .",
    "it naturally resolves apparently paradoxical physical features of the lefm universal fields and gives rise to a new intrinsic length scale , which is missing in lefm . as will be discussed soon",
    ", the latter plays an important role in dynamic instabilities .",
    "historically , early measurements showed that a running crack did not seem to be described by the equations of motion described in sect .",
    "[ sec : eom ] .",
    "in particular , these measurements suggested that even as robust a prediction as the limiting velocity of a dynamic crack seemed to be off ; cracks in brittle materials rarely surpassed even 60% of @xmath16 .",
    "these observations suggested that something was seriously wrong with our fundamental understanding of rapid crack dynamics , but it was unclear where the root of the problem lay .",
    "one could always `` blame '' the velocity dependence of the fracture energy , @xmath3 , but then one had to explain why , in brittle amorphous materials @xmath3 needed to increase precipitously in order to prevent eq .   from allowing a crack to approach @xmath16 .",
    "even more puzzling was the fact that this behavior occurs in a variety of materials whose molecular dissipative mechanisms are expected to be wholly unrelated ; these materials ranged from brittle ( cross - linked and uncross - linked ) polymers to glasses .",
    "the answer to the apparent paradox suggested above is that at high velocities , the crack is no longer a `` simple crack '' . instead , as first observed in @xcite , a crack s structure at relatively high propagation velocities",
    "is entirely different from that envisioned in the picture of simple crack ; high - speed photographs of rapid cracks showed that the structure of the crack tip was anything but simple . instead of the propagation of a single simple crack",
    ", these experiments showed that rapid cracks are composed of an ensemble of simultaneously propagating cracks .",
    "later experiments  @xcite , suggested that the break - up of a simple crack to multiple cracks occurred at a critical velocity , at which a single crack became unstable .",
    "this instability , which became known at the `` micro - branching '' instability , was later shown to be characteristic of many brittle amorphous materials  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of some of the early work on the micro - branching instability can be found in  @xcite .    , a single `` simple '' crack may become unstable to the micro - branching instability . at this point ( top ) the instantaneous velocity of the crack undergoes violent oscillations that correspond to the formation of subsurface frustrated micro - branches ( center ) , where side views ( @xmath89 plane ) of micro - cracks in both materials are presented ( @xmath90 is the propagation direction , @xmath49 is the loading direction and @xmath91 is the direction along the crack front ) .",

    "the cartoon in the center describes the geometry ; the @xmath92 fracture surface is formed by a propagating cracks whereas micro - branches ( dotted lines ) extend below the surfaceadapted from @xcite . ]",
    "what is the micro - branching instability ?",
    "for low crack velocities , the crack propagates smoothly and the fracture surfaces formed are smooth and mirror - like , with the only apparent structure caused by material defects interacting with the singular front @xcite . at a critical velocity of @xmath95 ,",
    "the crack undergoes a dynamic instability . as shown in fig .",
    "[ instabilities1 ] , rapid fluctuations appear in the instantaneous crack velocity and , at the same time , non - trivial structure emerges on the fracture surface . the fracture surface structure is accompanied by frustrated crack - branching , as multiple microscopic crack branches ( `` micro - branches '' ) are observed below the fracture surface . as the crack velocity increases beyond @xmath96 , both the length and density of the micro - branches increase with @xmath4 . the increased length and density of the micro - branches",
    "gives rise to correspondingly rougher fracture surface features , larger velocity fluctuations , and a sharp increase of the fracture energy that is proportional to the total micro - branch length @xcite .",
    "as fig .  [ instabilities1 ] demonstrates , these characteristic features are independent of the brittle material ; shown are two extremely different classes of material , poly - acrylamide gel ( an aqueous elastomer ) and soda - lime glass which exhibit identical characteristic behavior  @xcite .",
    "note the use of brittle gels has enabled experiments to probe the fracture process in unprecedented detail , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ instabilities2 ] .    over the past two decades",
    ", there have been a number of notable attempts to describe the micro - branching instability by supplementing or extending lefm in various ways .",
    "these include phase - field models @xcite , phase transformation models @xcite , cohesive - zone models @xcite , lattice models  @xcite , models based on the `` principle of local symmetry '' @xcite , energetic bounds on crack branching @xcite and models based on non - linear constitutive behavior near the crack tip @xcite .",
    "although many of these models exhibited some properties that were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations , they are inherently deficient because they focussed on 2d ( i.e. they actually studied macro - branching , which appears as a tip - splitting instability ) . as will be shown below , micro - branching appears to be an intrinsically 3d instability that can not be satisfactorily described as a 2d phenomenon .",
    "on the conceptual level , we note that most of previous works have considered the near - tip region as a passive region that both regularizes the singular fields predicted by lefm and accounts for the dissipative processes at the tip , but otherwise plays no other active role in the dynamics . as will be shown next",
    ", recent developments may suggest that understanding crack instabilities may entail the introduction of new physical ingredients ( e.g. length scales ) in which the near - tip region plays a more active role .      by manipulating the geometry and thickness of the brittle gels mentioned above ,",
    "it is possible to statistically suppress the micro - branching instability in sufficiently thin samples ( @xmath97 m )  @xcite ; while micro - branching can occur for _ all _ velocities @xmath98 , the probability of exciting them decreases for both thin samples and large crack accelerations .",
    "when micro - branching is suppressed , simple brittle cracks can reach extreme velocities .",
    "in such cases single crack dynamics , as described by lefm ( fig .  [ equmotion ] ) , can be obtained for velocities approaching @xmath16 .",
    "can these cracks actually reach their asymptotic velocity ?",
    "it turns out that this is prevented by a _ new _ instability .",
    "experiments in gels have found that at velocities surpassing about 90% of the shear wave - speed , @xmath39 , a straight crack becomes unstable to sinusoidal path oscillations @xcite .",
    "this instability is particularly intriguing since it involves a finite instability wavelength at onset .",
    "the value of the observed wavelength was not dependent on either the system geometry or the loading conditions .",
    "this suggests the existence of an intrinsic scale that can not exist in linear elastic solutions for cracks , which are scale - free .",

    "( b ) the oscillation wavelength , @xmath102 changes significantly with the material , as characterized by @xmath57 .",
    "symbol colors as in ( b ) . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "this oscillatory instability should be distinguished from apparently similar oscillatory cracks observed in rubber @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory cracks in rubber were intersonic ( @xmath103 )  @xcite , entailed bi - axial loading , and were subjected to very large background strains ( which make the material response nonlinear everywhere ) .",
    "the oscillatory cracks in the elastomer gels were subsonic and were observed under uniaxial loading of such magnitude ( @xmath104 ) that the deformation away from the tip was predominantly linear elastic .      in sects .",
    "[ sec : eom ] and [ sec : wnfm ] we discussed simple tensile cracks that propagate along straight paths in effectively 2d bodies . by so doing , we excluded spontaneous symmetry - breaking instabilities from the discussion .",
    "such dynamic instabilities , however , are rather prevalent and pose some of most intriguing open questions in the field of dynamic fracture . in sections [ microbranches ] and [ oscillations_section ] we described two different instabilities that take place in fast fracture .",
    "the oscillatory instability described in fig .",
    "[ oscillations ] is , in a sense , the simpler of the two instabilities .",
    "once excited , the oscillatory instability breaks the translational invariance of a crack in the propagation ( @xmath90 ) direction .",
    "the fracture surface created during the crack s motion is wavy but mirror - like ; there is no apparent structure along the fracture surface .",
    "thus , we can consider the crack front to be translationally invariant along the direction transverse ( @xmath91 direction ) to the crack s propagation direction .",
    "it is , therefore , sufficient to idealize the crack tip as an oscillating point within an effectively 2d medium .",
    "in contrast to the oscillatory instability , when the micro - branching instability is excited , distinct structures are generated along the fracture surface that are highly localized along both the @xmath90 and @xmath91 directions ( see , for example , the lower panels of fig .

    "not _ translationally invariant along the @xmath91 direction , it may not be sufficient to consider a crack propagating within a 2d medium to understand micro - branching .",
    "we now consider the oscillatory instability in a 2d medium . as mentioned above , the most interesting physical property of this instability , beyond its existence , is that its wavelength does not scale with the geometric dimensions of the sample .",
    "this implies that it can not be explained by lefm , as it possesses no intrinsic length scale beyond geometric length scales .",
    "what is then the origin of this instability and the emerging intrinsic length scale ?    to address this question , and dynamic fracture instabilities in a broader context , we need to consider first a basic aspect of the current theoretical status of the field .",
    "when cracks propagate along straight paths ( or other predetermined paths ) , the quantity of interest is the rate of crack growth , which involves a scalar relation based on energy balance . in the most general case",
    ", however , the path is an intrinsic property of the dynamic fracture problem and is selected self - consistently as in a large class of moving free - boundary problems ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we need an equation of motion for crack tips ( in 2d ) and crack fronts ( in 3d ) that will allow the determination of both the direction of propagation and its rate .",
    "such equations are intrinsically non - scalar in nature and involve physics that go significantly beyond energy balance alone . in particular ,",
    "such equations are essential in the context of instabilities as without them one can not even mathematically pose the question of stability , which amounts to perturbing solutions of existing and well - defined differential equations .",
    "we currently lack well - established crack tip / front equations of motion for general , non - straight , dynamics .    in 2d and under quasi - static conditions , @xmath105",
    ", it has been shown that the principle of local symmetry @xcite offers good approximations for crack paths @xcite .",
    "this approximation suggests that under quasi - static conditions , and under the assumption that no intrinsic length scales exist near the tip , crack propagation along smooth paths will annihilate any shear ( mode ii ) component of the fields ahead of the tip .",
    "hence , this path selection criterion proposes that conditions of local tensile symmetry are almost maintained at a crack s tip , which mathematically amounts to @xmath106 .",
    "as the stress intensity factors are generically non - local functionals of the path , the latter is in fact an integro - differential equation . at present , to the best of our knowledge , there is no evidence that the principle of local symmetry offers good approximations also under fully dynamic conditions .",

    "these recent experiments have revealed that super - shear ruptures are not rare at all , but appear in many cases when the initial energy stored in the surrounding material is much higher than that needed to drive a running crack . when loaded ballistically , super - shear states are observed only for relatively high projectile velocities @xcite , whereas in frictional sliding super - shear ruptures are initiated when the initial shear stresses are very large ( e.g. when the  friction coefficient \" is significantly greater than @xmath148 in pmma @xcite or granite @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to laboratory experiments and simulations , there is growing evidence that super - shear propagation can occur in earthquakes  @xcite which are often associated with extreme damage .    while their existence in no longer in doubt , a more precise characterization of super - shear ruptures is needed .",
    "it is not yet clear , for example , if the observed super - shear ruptures along frictional interfaces indeed correspond to  textbook \" super - shear solutions of mode ii fracture ( in analogy to the characterization performed in fig .",
    "[ strain fields ] for sub - rayleigh ruptures ) .",
    "the nucleation of super - shear ruptures is an important and still open question . while a number of scenarios for the nucleation of such modes have been suggested @xcite , it is not yet entirely clear how the transition from sub - rayleigh to super - shear ruptures comes about .",
    "a common theme among these different scenarios is that sufficient elastic energy becomes available in close proximity to a frictional interface .",
    "this has been shown to take place either via the interaction of the crack front with localized perturbations @xcite , via radiation from an existing sub - rayleigh front @xcite , or simply due to sufficient pre - existing strain energy surrounding the interface prior to nucleation @xcite .",
    "this last scenario has been suggested as a necessary one for mode i super - shear cracks in rubber - like materials  @xcite and may well be relevant for mode ii cracks as well .",
    "in the previous sections we highlighted a number of interesting topics in dynamic fracture that , in our opinion , have progressed significantly in recent years . below we list a number of promising research directions that are related to each topic .",
    "_ equation of motion for a crack .",
    "_ the work reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : eom ] has conclusively shown that the equation(s ) of motion for simple cracks are correct , as long as a crack remains simple .",
    "the energy balance criterion works perfectly as long as the propagation direction of the crack is both prescribed and the relevant boundary conditions are properly accounted for .",
    "we do not have , as yet , a general equation for determining the path of dynamic cracks .",
    "one such equation was discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:2dinstabilities ] and was applied to crack oscillations in 2d .",
    "other interesting work has been performed in relation to dynamic path selection in crystalline materials @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is still much more to be done in this direction .",
    "recent post - mortem analysis of fracture surface markings in pmma  @xcite has suggested that microscopic crack front motion takes place via the merging of voids ahead of the crack tip , at velocities significantly below the mean crack front velocity .",
    "whereas these observations are perfectly compatible with lefm , they raise an interesting question of size effects ; how large do inhomogeneities have to be in order to invalidate the continuum description of crack front propagation ? whereas the interaction of crack fronts with single asperities has been explored in the lefm framework @xcite , it will be interesting to see how / if this framework generalizes to a large number / size of defects .",
    "is there a scale where the crack front loses its identity as a coherent entity ?    _",
    "nonlinear elasticity and soft solids .",
    "_ lefm , as well as the weakly nonlinear theory , assume a  base \" state of zero background strain .",
    "this approximation works well for most  standard \" brittle materials , such as glass , brittle ceramics or brittle acrylics . lately",
    ", new classes of materials are becoming available that join natural rubber as elastic , yet brittle , materials that can sustain large background strains prior to fracture .",
    "the fracture resistance of some of these synthetic materials , such as double - network hydrogels made of ionically and covalently cross - linked networks @xcite , can be made to be enormous and new applications are expected to abound @xcite .",
    "in addition to such `` chemical gels '' , there is also clear experimental evidence that elastic nonlinearities are important to fracture processes in ",
    "physical gels \"  @xcite , i.e. weakly cross - linked elastomers , that are important in biological applications .",
    "as all of these materials exhibit large strains prior to fracture , existing theoretical frameworks should be extended to large background strains .",
    "very recent experiments have shown these effects to be important and the first extension of weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics to moderate background strains has been developed  @xcite .",
    "this framework might also apply to the related topic of the strength of tough pressure - sensitive adhesives , such as adhesive tapes @xcite .",
    "_ instabilities in dynamic fracture .",
    "_ the recent advances reviewed here may provide us with some tools needed to initiate a more complete understanding of dynamic instabilities . from these results",
    ", it appears that to fully understand these phenomena , the framework of fracture mechanics should be extended to systematically include 3d crack propagation .",
    "the near vicinity of the crack tip ( e.g. process zone ) is not simply a passive region that is needed to dissipate energy , but , as we saw in sect .  [ sec:2dinstabilities ]",
    ", the process zone can actively feed back to the elastic fields driving the crack to produce unstable behavior .",
    "the 3d form of micro - branches implies that these effects entail a finite - size perturbation to the crack front .",
    "initial studies of crack front waves considered only linear perturbations to an lefm - described front .",
    "further development of a nonlinear description of crack front behavior may provide a way to better explore crack front interactions with either active noise sources ( e.g. micro - branches ) or quenched noise , such as material inhomogeneities .",
    "other promising directions to describe 3d effects include the use of phase - field models to provide an accessible way to couple the nonlinear elastic fields to dynamic models describing the crack tip .",
    "some initial steps in this direction have been accomplished  @xcite , but there are still a number of open questions about how to ensure the physical predictive power of these models .",
    "_ fracture - based descriptions of friction .",
    "_ recent experiments have demonstrated that frictional motion is intimately related to dynamic fracture .",
    "a fundamental understanding of these important processes must , therefore , involve rapid fracture . while many related issues has been extensively discussed in the geophysical literature  @xcite , careful examination of frictional  fracture \" in well - controlled laboratory experiments has only began to emerge . in sect .",
    "[ sec : friction ] , a few aspects of this research direction have been mentioned .",
    "different modes of earthquake - like rupture states are expected to abound in these systems ; these range from sustained slow fracture modes to super - shear rupture .",
    "the results described in fig .",
    "[ strain fields ] , for example , relate to dry and rough frictional interfaces formed by _",
    "identical _ materials",
    ". it would be interesting to make a similar comparison to analytical results that describe mode ii super - shear cracks along homogeneous interfaces , whose singular properties are predicted to be quite different from those of standard cracks @xcite .",
    "entirely different classes of rupture , that include `` self - healing '' pulse - like as well as crack - like rupture states , are believed be generated within _",
    "bimaterial _ interfaces ; interfaces formed by two materials having different elastic properties @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite have demonstrated the existence of a number of these interesting modes .",
    "crack - like modes may also be excited within lubricated interfaces @xcite .",
    "like super - shear states , these rupture modes are predicted to possess functional forms that are still singular , but with singularities that may be entirely different from the square root singularity generally associated with cracks .",
    "in conclusion , in this perspectives piece we have presented a number of new and interesting developments in the field of dynamic fracture .",
    "the examples noted are all important , but are by no means all - inclusive .",
    "we have endeavored to show that dynamic fracture is not only important in itself , but is critical to our fundamental understanding of topics ranging from the strength of new  super - tough \" materials to the dynamics of earthquakes .",
    "we expect that these developments will continue into the next decades .",
