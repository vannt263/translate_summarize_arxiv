    "for many years now , there has been a concerted effort to understand the behavior of the conductance of quantum wires under variable conditions of disorder , wire width and temperature for diffusive electron transport ( for example , see refs . [ ] ) . for pure narrow samples of quantum wires",
    "whose widths are a few nanometers , the conductance plateaus are obtained as integer multiples of @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that since the kinetic energy dominates over the coulomb interaction in the limit of strong confinement , the conductance plateaus at integer multiples of @xmath2 may be adequately accounted for in pure samples with the use of a single - particle picture@xcite .",
    "however , as the width of the wire is increased , the coulomb interaction between electrons plays more and more of a role in determining the values of the conductance plateaus .",
    "the structural transition in a quasi - one - dimensional quantum - wire system was numerically predicted@xcite as early as in 2004 with a rich phase diagram .",
    "later , a theoretical model for a split wigner crystal into two chains ( zigzag crystal ) was proposed@xcite in 2007 ( for a review , see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "the effects of different pairwise repulsive interactions@xcite , tunnel coupling of two parabolic channels@xcite , different profiles of the confining channel@xcite , and even a quantum - ring structure@xcite or the the surface of a cylinder@xcite , on the continuous structural transitions of a wigner crystal were further studied .",
    "similar structural transitions of a wigner crystal to a zigzag crystal in an ion chain@xcite and in quantum wires controlled by an external gate@xcite were also explored .",
    "in addition , the spin peierls quantum phase transition in cold coulomb crystals of trapped ions@xcite , the spontaneous spin polarization due to the electron - electron interactions under a bias - field control@xcite , and the phase diagram of zigzag wigner crystals with spin coupling for two- , three and four - particle ring exchange processes@xcite , as well as melting of a quasi - one - dimensional wigner crystal observed from the nonlinear resistivity@xcite of electrons confined in quasi - one dimensional channels formed on the surface of superfluid @xmath3he , were reported .    despite the extensive theoretical studies on zigzag crystals for a long quantum wire , however , in a recent experiment@xcite for a short conduction channel formed by split gates , one finds that , as the top gate voltage is increased , the conductance for a wide wire at the interface of a gaas / algaas heterostructure jumps from zero to @xmath4 , bypassing the @xmath2 plateau which is encountered for narrow wires . for the picture of splitting into two rows ,",
    "the evolution of the crossing or anti - crossing of energy levels is not fully understood , and the purpose of this paper is to provide a microscopic theory which explains this observed phenomenon .",
    "additionally , we predict that the competition between the kinetic , direct coulomb and quantum mechanical exchange energy in wires of intermediate widths should lead to fundamental differences from that obtained in the two extreme limits of very narrow and very wide wires .",
    "we have demonstrated that these differences may be traced to the nature of the ground state as the wire width is varied .    in related work ,",
    "there have been several physical properties of the measured conductance of quasi - one - dimensional quantum wires which have been attributed to scattering from disorder potentials , the formation of a quantum dot within the channel caused by the presence of an impurity , as well as imperfections in the device geometry.@xcite these imperfections may lead to deviations from integer multiples of @xmath2 for the values of the conductance plateaus or resonance structure such as oscillations superimposed on the conductance trace.@xcite electron tunneling through the quantum dot in the channel as well as interference effects due to electron back - scattering from an impurity potential are believed to be responsible for these deviations in the values of the conductance plateaus of narrow quantum wires.@xcite    in chemistry , hybridization is the well - known concept for mixing atomic orbitals into new hybrid ones ( with different energies , shapes , etc .",
    ", than the component atomic orbitals ) , suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence bond theory .",
    "electronic orbital hybridization discussed in this paper means the mixing of orbitals of two interacting electron pairs to form a new ground and excited paired states@xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction for electron pairs can be used for building up the hybrid states while the pair ballistically passes along a one - dimensional conduction channel .",
    "our calculations reveal the role and the existence of these interacting hybrid states in quasi - one - dimensional quantum ballistic transports .",
    "more importantly , we demonstrate in our work that the degree and significance of hybridization ( coulomb - induced level anticrossing ) within such a structure may be tuned independently by varying the channel confinement with the use of a top gate .    in this paper",
    ", we confine our attention to a quasi - one - dimensional quantum wire containing a low density of electrons .",
    "we concentrate our efforts on calculating the lowest eigenstates for a pair of interacting electrons since this sheds some light on the role played by electron - electron interaction in determining the nature of the ground state of a dilute electron system and consequently the lowest quantum conductance .",
    "the complicated pair tunneling process@xcite will not be considered here since it does not lead to conductance plateaus observed in our experiment .",
    "we show below that there is a range of values of wire widths where the two - electron transport are hybrid by coulomb interaction , and therefore , it is not possible to describe the conductance in terms of a single - particle picture .",
    "the eigenstates of a pair of interacting electrons under the influence of a harmonic confining potential have been evaluated by several authors.@xcite in the paper by wagner , et al.,@xcite a quantum dot with a symmetric harmonic oscillator potential to confine the electrons was considered and it was noted that , consistent with kohn s theorem@xcite , the coulomb interaction affects only the relative motion but not the center - of - mass properties .",
    "it was then demonstrated with the use of perturbation theory that as the strength of an external perpendicular magnetic field is increased , the ground state oscillates between a spin - singlet and a spin - triplet mode .",
    "bryant@xcite showed correlation effects between electrons depend on the size of the boxes containing them . by solving the schrdinger equation exactly for a pair of interacting electrons ,",
    "we demonstrate how correlations may determine the ground state and give rise to quasi - particles which participate in the transport processes .",
    "if the scattering by either randomly distributed impurities and defects or by phonons are neglected at low temperatures for high - mobility short channel samples , the coherence in the wave functions of electron pairs may be maintained during pair transport along the channel .",
    "additionally , if the transmission coefficient for the injection of electron pairs into the channel is close to unity in the absence of a significant reflection from potential barriers in their path and inelastic scattering between different pair states , we are able to use a quantum ballistic transport model for interacting electron pairs as far as the coulomb interaction between electrons in the channel is fully taken into account . our quantum ballistic system with transport of interacting electron pairs",

    "it is also clear that the incomplete @xmath4 conductance plateau in ( a ) for the interacting electron pair is completely destroyed in this regime .",
    "however , the recovery of the single - particle - like @xmath2 plateau , as seen in fig.[fig:2](a ) , can be seen in this plot .",
    "additionally , the @xmath2 plateau further expands and extends to lower and lower electron densities as @xmath67 increases up to @xmath83 .",
    "this unique reoccurrence feature can be fully explained by the rising energy levels at higher densities due to relatively enhanced coulomb repulsion as displayed in figs.[fig:1](c ) and ( d ) .    for clarity , we note that as a pair of electrons are injected into a conduction channel , they may select specific subbands for their transport ballistically .",
    "this selection rule is determined by the occupation factor of the electrons already within the channel . during the period of time that the two injected moving electrons",
    "are within the channel , they may interact with each other through either the intrasubband or the intersubband coulomb coupling .",
    "we emphasize that the linear density of electrons confined within the channel may be held constant when the channel width is varied .",
    "for this to occur , the fermi energy will adjust itself to accommodate all electrons and additional subbands are populated accompanied by reduced energy level separations . specifically , the fermi energy is actually reduced and the number of electrons in the channel is not changed at all . furthermore , although the fermi energy is reduced , the second level may still be populated due to reduced level separation to keep the number of electrons in the channel a constant . clearly ,",
    "enhancement of the coulomb interaction is not solely determined by the electron density , since it also depends on how electrons are distributed . for the coulomb effect on the states of the pair of electrons , the inclusion of a new populated pair state , with one electron in a lower energy level and the other electron in a higher level , will induce a new coulomb effect on the pair states of electrons .",
    "as the transverse confinement becomes weaker ( or the @xmath67 value is increased ) , the kinetic part of the energy levels @xmath65 of a pair will drop as @xmath84 for fixed @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , by increasing @xmath67 , the significance of coulomb interaction , which scales as @xmath53 as shown by eq.([e3 ] ) , will be relatively enhanced .",
    "in addition , the second energy level will be occupied by increasing @xmath67 for fixed electron density due to reduced level separation .",
    "consequently , the additional coulomb repulsion between two electrons on different energy levels is introduced .",
    "this effect is reflected in figs.[fig:4](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) as pushing up the energy levels @xmath85 and @xmath72 ( as @xmath74 ) in the region of @xmath71 when @xmath86@xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of three - fold spin degeneracy in the @xmath73 level pushes itself above the @xmath72 level as the coulomb interaction is enhanced for @xmath71 .",
    "however , the @xmath88 electron pair state , associated with two excited - state electrons , is still dominated by the kinetic energy for the whole range of @xmath67 shown in this figure . as @xmath5 further increases , the coulomb repulsion effect extends to the intermediate confinement regime in fig.[fig:4](d ) . as a whole",
    ", we find the ground state @xmath85 level in ( a ) for small values of @xmath67 and @xmath5 ( where the kinetic energy of electrons is dominant ) is fully recovered in ( d ) for large values of @xmath67 and @xmath5 ( where the coulomb energy is dominant ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exists an intermediate confinement regime ( @xmath89 ) between the strong ( scaling as fast drop @xmath84 for @xmath90 ) and weak ( scaling as slow drop @xmath53 for @xmath52 ) confinement regimes , where the coulomb interaction between electrons can be relatively highlighted to give rise to pushing up of three energy levels and the recovery of the the ground state @xmath85 level simultaneously .",
    "the ground - state recovery observed in fig.[fig:4 ] has a profound influence both on the distribution of conductance plateaus and on the interplay of the electron hybridization , as displayed in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "when @xmath5 is very small , the coulomb effect can be neglected . in this case , the @xmath2 conductance plateau is observed for the interacting electron pair as shown in ( a ) for all values of @xmath67 .",

    "we present the contour plots of conductance @xmath77 and diffusion thermoelectric power of electrons @xmath93 as functions of @xmath67 and @xmath5 in fig.[fig:6 ] for both non - interacting and interacting electron pairs as a comparison . by comparing ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath77 , we find that the coulomb effect is most dominant in the upper right - hand corner region of ( b ) within a weak confinement regime and a relatively high electron density , where a gradual conductance is replaced by a @xmath2 conductance plateau due to strong coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "in addition , we also find another @xmath4 conductance plateau in the lower - right corner region of ( b ) ( which is separated by a spike in @xmath77 from the upper - right corner region ) , where confinement is intermediate or stronger but the electron density is high . from the comparison of ( c ) and ( d ) , we find that the coulomb interaction suppresses @xmath93 in the weak confinement region and with a relatively high electron density . under very strong confinement ,",
