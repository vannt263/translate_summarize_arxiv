    "one may therefore suspect that some unknown interactions may be mediated by scalar fields .",
    "such theories have been suggested since before the appearance of general relativity .",
    "moreover , it has been repeatedly pointed out over the years that unified theories that contain gravity as well as other interactions naturally give rise to scalar fields coupled to matter with gravitational strength .",
    "this motivation has led many theoretical physicists to study scalar - tensor theories of gravity ( scalar - tensor theories ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories are natural alternatives to general relativity , and gravity is mediated not only by a tensor field but also by a scalar field in these theories .",
    "recently , such theories have been of interest as effective theories of string theory at low energy scales @xcite .",
    "many predictions of the scalar - tensor theories in strong gravitational fields are summarized in ref.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",

    "in general relativity , the mass - to - size ratio of a star has physical significance , especially for an isolated system .",

    "the density at any point in the star is a positive and monotonously decreasing function of the radius . * an interior solution of the star smoothly matches an exterior solution , i.e. , schwarzschild s solution .",
    "buchdahl has obtained an upper limit of the mass - to - size ratio as @xmath6 .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ buchdahl inequality_.    motivated by buchdahl s theorem , we shall derive a modified buchdahl inequality to obtain the maximum mass - to - size ratio in scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we then numerically examine the validity of the assumptions made in deriving the inequality .",
