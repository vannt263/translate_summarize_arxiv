    "to avoid this problem we could use the _ completed _ or _ topological _ tensor product @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",

    ", we can consider the subalgebras @xmath27 of @xmath3 such that @xmath28 .",
    "such algebras are of course much easier to describe then a completed tensor product . for our purpuse , we are interested in the case when one of these subalgebras is big enough to describe completely the group",

    "renormalization and semidirect product of series dyson s formula  ( [ dyson - formula ] ) , together with the formulae  ( [ bare - mass ] ) and ( [ bare - lambda ] ) , answers to the question that we posed at the beginning of this section . combining all of them , in fact",

    "then , the inclusion @xmath709 is defined as follows : consider the expansion ( [ z - c ] ) of the renormalization factors in terms of the counterterms of the divergent graphs , namely @xmath710 and assign to a generator @xmath711 of @xmath705 the combination of feynman graphs appearing in the coefficient of @xmath712 in the series @xmath713",

    "formal diffeomorphisms are formal series in the powers of the coupling constant @xmath281 , that is , series of the form @xmath716 endowed with the composition law .    a useful way to understand the map @xmath717 is to represent the diffeographisms as a generalization of usual series of the form @xmath718 where the sum is over suitable feynman diagrams @xmath389 , the coefficients @xmath719 are taken in the algebra @xmath693 , and the powers @xmath720 are not monomials in a possibly complex variable @xmath281 , but just formal symbols .",
    "the projection @xmath721 is simply the dual map of the inclusion @xmath722 , and sends a diffeographism of the form ( [ diffeographism ] ) into the formal diffeomorphism @xmath723 in other words , the projection is induced on the series by the map which sends a graph @xmath389 to the number @xmath391 of its internal vertices .",
    "series of the form ( [ diffeographism ] ) are unreal , and of course have no physical meaning . instead , their images ( [ physical - diffeomorphism ] ) are usual series , and have a physical meaning in the context of perturbative quantum field theory : the coupling constants are exactely series of this form , summed up over suitable sets of feynman diagrams .",
    "moreover , the green s functions and the renormalization factors are series of this form modulo a constant term which makes them being invertible series instead of formal diffeomorphisms . in conclusion ,",
    "the meaning of connes and kreimer s results is that the renormalization procedure takes place in the group @xmath714 , even if the physical results are read in the group @xmath715 .",
    "* diffeographisms and dyson s formulas * according to section  [ renormalization - dyson ] , the result of renormalization is described by dyson s formulas ( [ dyson - formula ] ) directly on usual series in the powers of the coupling constant @xmath281 . as we said ,",
    "this happens in the semidirect product @xmath724 of the groups of formal diffeomorphisms by that of invertible series .",
    "however , these formulas require the knowledge of the renormalization factors . according to ( [ z - c ] ) ,",
    "these are known through the computations of the counterterms of all feynman graphs . in other words ,",
    "the physical results given by dyson s formulas seem to be the projection of computations which take place in the semidirect product @xmath725 , where @xmath714 is the diffeographisms group dual to the connes - kreimer hopf algebra , and @xmath726 is a suitable lifting of the group of invertible series whose coordinate ring is spanned by feynman graphs .    this conjecture has been proved for quantum electrodynamics in the sequel of works @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the green s functions are expanded over _ planar binary trees _ , that is , planar trees with internal vertices of valence 3 , which were used by c.  brouder in @xcite as intermediate summation terms between integer numbers and feynman graphs .",
    "it has also been proved by w.  van suijlekom in @xcite for any gauge theory . for the @xmath0-theory",
    "the work is in progress .",
    "* groups of `` combinatorial '' series * if the diffeographisms are represented as generalized series of the form ( [ diffeographism ] ) , the group law dual to the coproduct in @xmath668 should be represented as a `` composition '' among them .",
    "this operation has been defined in principle by p.  van der laan in @xcite , using operads .",
    "an _ operad _ is the set of all possible operations of a given type that one can do on any algebra of that type .",
    "a particular algebra is then a representation of the corresponding operad .",
    "for instance , there exists the operad of associative algebras , that of lie algebras , and many other examples of operads giving rise to corresponding types of algebras . by assumption ,",
    "operads are endowed with an intrinsic _ operadic composition _ which allows to perform the operations one after another one in the corresponding algebras , and still get the result of an operation .",
    "the group @xmath242 of formal diffeomorphisms is deeply related to the operad @xmath727 of associative algebras , and in particular the composition of formal series in one variable can be directly related to the operadic composition in @xmath727 .",
    "based on this observation , van der laan had the idea to realize the `` composition '' among diffeographisms as the operadic composition of a suitable operad constructed on feynman graphs . in @xcite , he indeed defined an _",
    "operad of all feynman graphs _ , but did nt describe explicitely how to restrict the general construction to the particular case of feynman graphs for a given theory . in particular , the explicit form of the group @xmath714 related to the renormalization of the @xmath0-theory is not achieved .    a complete description of the generalized series and their composition law is given in @xcite for the renormalization of quantum electrodynamics , on the intermediate coordinate rings spanned by planar binary trees .",
    "however , trees are combinatorial objets much simplier to handle then feynman graphs , and the generalization of this construction to diffeographisms is still uncomplete .",
    "groups of series expanded over other `` combinatorial objects '' , such as rooted ( non - planar ) trees , also appear in the context of renormalization .",
    "such trees , in fact , can be used to describe the perturbative expansion of green s functions , and were used by d.  kreimer in @xcite to describe the first hopf algebra of renormalization appearing in the literature .",
    "the dual group of tree - expanded series was then used by f.  girelli , t.  krajewski and p.  martinetti in @xcite , in their study of wilson s continuous renormalization group .    furthermore , the series expanded over various `` combinatorial objects '' make sense not only in the context of the renormalization of a quantum field theory , but already for classical interacting fields .",
    "in fact , as we pointed out in section  [ series - classical ] , these fields are described perturbatively as series expanded over trees",
    ". then , any result on usual series which has a physical meaning should be the projection of computations which take place in the corresponding set of `` combinatorial series '' .    finally , all the hopf algebras constructed on `` combinatorial objects '' which appear in physics share some properties which are investigated in various branches of mathematics .",
