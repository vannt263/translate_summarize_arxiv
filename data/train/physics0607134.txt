    "there is a wave of interest to study complex networks by statistical physical means @xcite .",
    "the area of studies include the internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , scientific collaboration networks ( scn ) @xcite , biological networks @xcite and the world - wide airport network ( wan ) @xcite . in all these cases , one can naturally identify the subject under study with a graph .",
    "for instance , an airport in a wan can be represented by a vertex ; and there is a link between two vertices if and only if there is a direct flight between the corresponding airports .",
    "although these complex networks are drawn from vastly different systems in the real world , they exhibit the following universal properties :    1",
    ".   _ scale - free behavior of degree distribution _ : let @xmath0 be the probability that any vertex is connected to @xmath1 other vertices ( i.e. the vertex is of degree @xmath1 ) . in many real - world networks , @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "clustering property _ : clustering of a vertex @xmath4 gives the probability that two nearest neighbors are connected with each other . and",
    "the average clustering coefficient @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of vertices in the network , measures the global density of interconnected vertex triplets in the network .",
    "real - world networks in general exhibit higher clustering coefficient than those in random networks @xcite .",
    "small - world property _ : a network is said to have small - world property if the average shortest path length between two vertices scales at most logarithmically with @xmath6 for fixed mean degree @xcite .",
    "_ correlations of degree _ : an assortative ( a disassortative ) network tends to connect vertices with similar ( dissimilar ) degrees .",
    "previous studies found that social networks tend to be assortative while technological and biological networks are generally disassortative @xcite .",
    "various network models have been proposed to simulate or explain the properties found in complex networks in the real world .",
    "for instance , the erds - rnyi random graph model @xcite generates static networks that exhibit small - world property . nonetheless , the degree distribution of the network generated is poissonian rather than a power - law .",
    "later on , barabsi and albert ( ba ) extended the erds - rnyi random graph model by evolving the network using a linear preferential attachment mechanism @xcite .",
    "the ideas behind the ba model are that most real - world networks tend to growth with time , and a new vertex tends to connect to pre - existing high - degree vertices .",
    "sen further incorporated non - linear growth property of the number of links to the ba model by demanding the number of links of the vertex added at time @xmath7 to be @xmath8 for some positive constant @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both the ba model and the sen model generate networks with scale - free topology ; but they failed to reproduce the degree correlations and clustering properties of real - world networks .",
    "structural organization of a network can be characterized by degree - dependent average nearest - neighbors degree @xmath10 @xcite , the degree - dependent average clustering coefficient @xmath11 @xcite and assortativity coefficient @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "proposed the generalized local - world models @xcite in which a subset of vertices is randomly chosen every time step .",
    "the newly added vertex can only make connection to vertices in this subset .",
    "moreover , liu _",
    "proposed the self - learning mutual selection model @xcite in which every vertex has some probability to self evolve in each time step .",
    "these two models successfully reproduce the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 observed in real - world networks . however , these quantities only depend on the topological structure of a network . the relative importance between different links is not taken into consideration . to provide a better description of a network",
    ", the intensity of interaction among vertices should be taken into account .",
    "one may define the weight of a link @xmath13 as the intensity of interaction between vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the vertex strength @xmath16 as the sum of weight of the links connected to @xmath14 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the nearest neighbors of @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , the weight @xmath13 in wan refers to the number of seats available on the direct flight connections between the airports @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "and @xmath16 represents the total traffic going through the airport @xmath14 . to probe the weighted networks architecture , a set of weighted quantities are introduced , such as the weighted degree - dependent average clustering coefficient @xmath19 and the weighted degree - dependent average nearest - neighbor degree @xmath20 @xcite",
    "however , no one has proposed a quantity that can directly measure the correlations of degree with inclusion of weight so far . here",
    "we introduce the weighted assortativity coefficient @xmath21 to measure the tendency of having a high - weighted link between two vertices of similar degrees .",
    "in addition , we propose a model that incorporates the essential features of strength preferential attachment , nonlinear growth of number of links , and weight evolution of existing links .",
    "we call this the weight evolution model",
    ". the rule of weight evolution are based on the notion that `` the rich always gets richer '' . in other words , high - weighted link has higher probability to evolve .",
    "besides , inspired by the work of dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite , existing links in the graph can be removed . by altering the speed of weight evolution ,",
    "our model can generate both assortative and disassortative networks with scale - free behavior and non - trivial clustering properties .",
    "most importantly , both topologically assortative and disassortative networks generated by our model are in fact weighted assortative .    in section  [ model ]",
    ", we define the weight evolution model .",
    "we report our analytical calculations and numerical results on the probability distributions of strength of vertex and weight of link in section  [ str ] .",
    "then in section  [ clustering ] we define the weighted assortativity coefficient and compare the organizational structure found in real - world networks with our numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the model starts with a small number @xmath22 of fully connected undirected vertices .",
    "the weight of all the @xmath23 initial links are set to @xmath24 . in each time step",
    ", the network evolves under the following rules :    1 .   _ topological growth _ :",
    "a new vertex is added to the network .",
    "we assume that the number of links of the new vertex is an increasing function of the network size . specifically , a vertex with @xmath25 $ ] links are added to the network at time @xmath7 for some fixed constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( here @xmath28 $ ] denotes the value of @xmath29 rounded to the nearest integer . )",
    "these @xmath30 $ ] links are all of weight @xmath24 and are randomly connected to the existing vertices according to the strength preferential probability @xmath31 , which is defined as @xcite @xmath32 2 .",
    "_ evolution of weight _ : the link between vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 is chosen to evolve with probability @xmath33 proportional to its weight , namely @xmath34 the weight will update according to the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 at time step @xmath7 , this process will repeat @xmath37 $ ] times and a link is removed if the weight equals to @xmath38 .",
    "( in other words , the sign of @xmath39 determines the addition or subtraction of weight of a link ; and the magnitude of @xmath39 specifies the rate of the addition / subtraction per time step . )",
    "note that @xmath40 , @xmath39 and @xmath9 are the tunable parameters in this model .",
    "clearly , our model generalizes the ba model @xcite and the sen model @xcite .",
    "in particular , our model is reduced to the ba model by setting @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and reduced to the sen model by setting @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we now justify the validity of our rules .",
    "note that in most real - world networks , new vertices are introduced one at a time ; and they tend to connect to the pre - existing high strength vertices",
    ". in the example of wan , new airport tends to establish flights to existing airports with heavy traffic .",
    "our topological growth process is used to capture this kind of network growth . moreover ,",
    "our weight evolution mechanism models the trend that the link with higher weight have a higher probability to evolve .",
    "for instance , in scn @xcite , a vertex represent a scientist and a link is present if two scientists have co - authored at least one paper .",
    "the weight between two scientists is higher if they have higher number of co - authored papers .",
    "naturally , if the weight between two scientists is high , the probability for them to collaborate again is also high .",
    "in our model , the processes of topological growth and weight evolution are markovian .",
    "thus , the evolution of our network can be calculated accurately by mean field approximation .",
    "appendix  [ ana ] reports the mean field calculation of the probability distribution of vertex strength @xmath46 and probability distribution of weight of link @xmath47 .",
    "we found that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where    @xmath50 ~ ,   \\label{e : gammas}\\ ] ]    @xmath51 ~.   \\label{e : gammaw}\\ ] ]    to check the validity of our analytical solution , we performed numerical simulations on our network model for different values of @xmath39 and @xmath9 . since @xmath40 , @xmath39 and @xmath24 govern the relative speed between new link addition and weight evolution , one can fix two of these three parameters without losing any generality . in this paper",
    ", we fix @xmath45 and @xmath52 unless otherwise stated .",
    "besides , we set the number of initial vertices @xmath22 to @xmath53 ; and we have checked that the networks generated using different values of @xmath40 and @xmath22 exhibit similar behaviors as long as @xmath54 . using this set of parameters , we found that statistical data collected from the network equilibrate after @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we collect all our statistical data at @xmath56 and all the data reported here have been averaged over 50 independent runs .",
    "our model successfully reproduces the scale - free behavior of the probability distributions of strength and weight with a tunable exponent that depends on the microscopic mechanism ruling the weight evolution .",
    "we found in appendix  [ num ] that the numerical simulation results agree with the mean field approximation .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the quantities used to characterize the clustering and correlations behaviors of a network . then we introduce the weighted assortativity coefficient @xmath21 . finally , we report the numerical simulation results of our model .",
    "we overload the notation by labeling the vertex added to the network in time step @xmath14 also by @xmath14 .",
    "the clustering of @xmath14 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the degree of @xmath14 and @xmath59    if vertex @xmath14 has less than two neighbors , @xmath4 is set to @xmath38 . clustering @xmath4 measures the local cohesiveness of vertex @xmath14 while the average clustering coefficient @xmath5 measures the global density of interconnected triples in the network",
    ". organizational structure of network can be further studied via the degree - dependent average clustering coefficient @xmath11 , @xmath60 which is the mean clustering for vertices with degree @xmath1 .    to have a better understanding of the organizational structure of weighted networks ,",
    "the weighted clustering @xmath61 is introduced and defined as @xcite @xmath62 if vertex @xmath14 tends to form triples with other vertices by its high - weighted links , then @xmath63 meaning that the topological clustering of @xmath14 underrates the cohesiveness of @xmath14 .",
    "the weighted average clustering coefficient @xmath64 and weighted degree - dependent average clustering coefficient @xmath65 are defined as the average of @xmath61 over all vertices and over all vertices with degree @xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the degree correlation is another important information of the network .",
    "recall that the network is said to be assortative if the vertices tend to connect to other vertices which have similar ( dissimilar ) properties .",
    "newman introduced the assortativity coefficient @xcite    @xmath66 ^ 2 } { \\frac{m^{-1}}{2}\\sum_\\phi ( \\sum_{i\\in f(\\phi)}k_i^2)-[\\frac{m^{-1}}{2}\\sum_\\phi ( \\sum_{i\\in f(\\phi)}k_i)]^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to measure the degree correlation between linked vertices , where @xmath67 denotes the set of the two vertices connected by the @xmath68th link and @xmath69 is the total number of links in the network .",
    "this measure @xmath12 is positive ( negative ) for assortative ( disassortative ) networks ; and @xmath70 for a random graph .",
    "note that @xmath12 is independent of the weight of each link of a network .    to probe the degree correlation of the network ,",
    "one may also study the average nearest - neighbors degree , which is defined as @xcite @xmath71 the degree - dependent average nearest - neighbors degree @xmath10 is the mean of @xmath72 restricted to the class of degree @xmath1 vertices . in an assortative ( disassortative ) network , vertices with high degree tend to connect to other vertices with high ( low ) degree , thus @xmath10 would be an increasing ( decreasing ) function of @xmath1 . in real - world weighted networks , high degree vertices could connect to small degree vertices with low weight , while connect to high degree vertices with high weight .",
    "for instance , in wan , the high degree airport @xmath14 could have a lot of direct flight to another high degree airport @xmath15 , while have less number of flight to a low degree airport @xmath73 . in this case",
    ", @xmath10 will underestimate the tendency for having heavy traffic between two similar degree airports . to handle this problem , barrat _ et al .",
    "_ proposed the weighted average nearest - neighbor degree @xcite @xmath74 if the weighted degree - dependent nearest - neighbors degree @xmath20 is an increasing function of @xmath1 , similar degree vertices tend to link together . besides , the weights of these links tend to be high .",
    "consequently , the network is weighted assortative .    although one can figure out that the network is assortative or disassortative if @xmath20 is increasing or decreasing with @xmath1 , a quantity directly describing the weighted assortativity is needed .",
    "thus we introduce the weighted assortativity coefficient    @xmath75 ^ 2 } { \\frac{h^{-1}}{2}\\sum_\\phi ( \\varpi_\\phi\\sum_{i\\in f(\\phi)}k_i^2)- [ \\frac{h^{-1}}{2}\\sum_\\phi ( \\varpi_\\phi\\sum_{i\\in f(\\phi)}k_i)]^2 } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the weight of the @xmath68th link , @xmath67 is the set of the two vertices connected by the @xmath68th link and @xmath77 is the total weight of all links in the network . just like @xmath12",
    ", @xmath21 lies between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 is positive for weighted assortative networks , while negative for weighted disassortative networks . if @xmath80 , a high - weighted link tend to connect two similar degree vertices together . in fact",
    ", @xmath21 reduces to @xmath12 if all weights in the network are equal . furthermore , @xmath81 for a random graph .",
    "[ f : ex_graph ] illustrates that the values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 of a network can differ greatly . the network in fig .",
    "[ f : ex_graph ] consists of two complete graphs of three vertices that are joined together by a highly weighted link .",
    "since the five out of seven of the links in this network connect two vertices of different degree together , the assortativity coefficient @xmath12 of this network is negative .",
    "( in fact @xmath82 . ) on the other hand , the weighted assortativity coefficient @xmath21 of this network is positive .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the link between the two degree three vertices in this network carries the most weight .",
    "so after coarse - graining , the network is similar to the one making up of a single link connecting two degree one vertices together plus another four isolated vertices . and clearly , the coarse - grained network is assortative .",
    "therefore , when the weight of link are taken into account , the network in fig .",
    "[ f : ex_graph ] ought to be assortative rather than disassortative .",
    "( in fact @xmath83 . ) in this respect , the weighted assortativity coefficient @xmath21 better determines the assortativity of networks with weighted links than the assortativity coefficient @xmath12 .",

    "surprisingly , @xmath84 for both assortative and disassortative networks provided that @xmath93 .",
    "this observation indicates that the topological assortativity coefficient underrates the contributions of high - weighted links between similar degree vertices .",
    "our finding shows that studying the assortativity of a network by considering network topology alone @xcite does not give a complete picture of the organizational structure of the network .    the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ f : rw - r ] ) can be understood qualitatively by considering the evolution mechanisms of our model .",
    "for @xmath92 , a newly added vertex is the one with low degree and it tends to connect to existing high - strength and high - degree vertices .",
    "this process leads to topologically disassortative behavior .",
    "meanwhile , a link introduced at an early time , which connects two old vertices having similar degrees together , tends to be high - weighted as @xmath94 .",
    "this leads to the observed weighted assortative behavior .",
    "on the other hand , assortative networks emerge at @xmath90 .",
    "it is because the strength of old vertices are low .",
    "hence , there is a high chance for two young vertices having similar degrees to connect .",
    "as @xmath9 increases , the strength of old vertices decrease while the new vertices enter the network with a higher strength .",

    "this result indicates that the topological clustering coefficient @xmath11 underestimate the cohesiveness of the network .",

    "<S> , a network evolves by topological growth as well as by weight change . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we introduce the weighted assortativity coefficient , which generalizes the assortativity coefficient of a topological network , to measure the tendency of having a high - weighted link between two vertices of similar degrees . </S>",
    "<S> network generated by our model exhibits scale - free behavior with a tunable exponent . besides , a few non - trivial features found in real - world networks are reproduced by varying the parameter ruling the speed of weight evolution . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , by studying the weighted assortativity coefficient , we found that both topologically assortative and disassortative networks generated by our model are in fact weighted assortative . </S>"
