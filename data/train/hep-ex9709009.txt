    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) has taken a very prominent position in today s description of experimental results .",
    "perhaps the most compelling reason for this state of affairs is that the experimental results have reached a level of precision which require a comparison with theory beyond the born calculations , which the @xmath4 is able to provide .",
    "it is widely anticipated , though , that the @xmath4 is just an approximate theory and should eventually be replaced by a more complete and fundamental description of the underlying forces in nature . since the highest center of mass energies are reached at hadron colliders , notably the tevatron , the measurements at this accelerator provide natural tools to probe the @xmath4 at the highest energy scale .    in this summary the most recent electroweak results from the multi - purpose detectors cdf and 0 operating at the fermilab tevatron collider",
    "will be described .",
    "the 0 detector has a non - magnetic inner tracking system , compact , hermetic , uranium liquid - argon calorimetry and an extensive muon system .",
    "the cdf detector has a magnetic central detector , scintillator based calorimetry and a central muon system . during the 1992 - 1993 run ,",
    "generally called run  ia , the cdf and 0 experiments have collected @xmath520  pb@xmath6 and @xmath515  pb@xmath6 of data , respectively . for the 1994 - 1995 run ( run  ib )",
    "both experiments have collected @xmath590  pb@xmath6 of data .",
    "first , results on inclusive and differential @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections are presented .",
    "the @xmath2 mass measurement is then described with its dominant uncertainties . in the last section",
    "triple gauge boson interactions are discussed .",
    "in collisions intermediate vector bosons are produced predominantly by quark - antiquark annihilation . at @xmath8",
    "tev sea - sea interactions contribute approximately 20% to the total cross section .",
    "the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath2 and @xmath7-bosons are easily detected because of their characteristic decay signatures : for a @xmath2 decay a high @xmath9 lepton accompanied by large missing transverse energy ( ) , indicating the presence of a neutrino , and two high @xmath9 leptons for @xmath7-decays .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections probes the @xmath4 of electroweak and strong interactions and provides insight in the structure of the proton .",
    "a persistent uncertainty on any cross section measurement at a collider , however , is the large uncertainty on the integrated luminosity due to the uncertainty on the effective total cross section seen by the detectors .",
    "this uncertainty cancels completely in the ratio of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections , a quantity that can be used to extract the width of the @xmath2-boson , @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement of the individual cross sections is thus geared towards maximizing the cancellation of the different uncertainties in the ratio of the two cross section measurements .",
    ".analysis results for the @xmath2 and @xmath7-production cross section measurement for cdf and preliminary results for 0 .",
    "a@xmath11 , @xmath12 and bkg stand for acceptance , detection efficiency and bkg , respectively , for vector boson @xmath13 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     where it was assumed that the @xmath14 couplings and the @xmath15 couplings were equal .",
    "strong contraints are anticipated when all results from both cdf and 0 are combined .",
    "as for the gauge boson self - interactions , again , agreement with the @xmath4 expectation is observed .",
    "but , deviations were not really expected , since most models predict anomalous couplings of order @xmath16 .",
    "these measurement , however , do tell us that a @xmath2 boson is more than just an electrically charged boson .",
    "the point labeled @xmath17 in figs .  [ fig : wwljet ] and  [ fig : wgamma_lim ] corresponds to the values of the couplings if the @xmath2 boson would only couple electromagnetically .",
    "it is clear that this point is excluded by the data , showing that the @xmath2 boson is really a gauge boson .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 trilinear gauge boson couplings are described in a way analogous to the @xmath21 couplings .",
    "these couplings , absent in the @xmath4 , are suggested by some theoretical models which imply new physics .",
    "the most general lorentz and gauge invariant @xmath22 vertex is described by eight coupling parameters , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , which also are modulated by form factors to preserve unitarity , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the square of the invariant mass of the @xmath18 system and @xmath27 is the form - factor scale .",
    "the energy dependence of the form factor is assumed to be @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "such a choice yields the same asymptotic energy behavior for all the couplings .",
    "the study of anomalous couplings in the process @xmath32 is analogous to the @xmath33 analysis , that is , events are selected with a photon produced in association with a @xmath7 boson and the observed number of events compared with the number of expected radiative @xmath7 and background events  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 spectrum is again used to set limits on possible anomalous couplings .",
    "the 0 experiment has recently performed a new analysis based on the run  ia data , looking for the decay @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this channel has previously been studied only in @xmath36-collisions  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity to anomalous couplings in this channel is much higher than in the di - lepton decay modes due to the higher decay rate into neutrinos and the absence of the radiative @xmath7 decay background .",
    "the overall background , however , is still extremely high , leading to very stringent event selection criteria . to reduce the background from @xmath2+jet events with the electron or jet",
    "being misidentified as a photon the @xmath37 and were required to exceed 40  gev . in addition , events with at least one jet with @xmath38  gev were rejected .",
    "the remaining background was dominated by cosmic rays and muons from beam halo which radiated in the calorimeter .",
    "this background was suppressed by rejecting events with a reconstructed muon or a minimum ionizing trace in the calorimeter close to the photon cluster .",
    "the residual background , which had roughly equal contributions from @xmath39 decays and muon bremsstrahlung , was derived from data .",
    "four candidate events are observed on an expected background of @xmath40 events and a @xmath4 prediction of @xmath41 events .",
    "although the signal - to - background ratio is less than one , the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is still high , since the background is concentrated at low @xmath37 while the anomalous coupling contribution is almost flat in @xmath37 up to the kinematic threshold of the process .",
    "limits on anomalous couplings were set at 95% cl by a fit to the @xmath37 spectrum and gives @xmath42 , @xmath43 for @xmath44  gev .",
    "these limits , based on 14  pb@xmath6 of data , are more stringent than the limits obtained from the analysis of the full run  i data using the electron and muon decays of the @xmath7 boson , indicating the strength of the neutrino channel .",
    "a summary of all the limits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zg_limits ] .",
    "a wide variety of properties of the @xmath2 and @xmath7-bosons are now being studied at hadron colliders with ever increasing precision , at the highest energy scales achievable .",
    "all results , including the results from @xmath45 colliders  @xcite , are in good agreement with the @xmath4 .",
    "it is widely anticipated , though , that the @xmath4 is just an approximate theory and should eventually be replaced by a more complete and fundamental description of the underlying forces in nature . with the new data from lep  2 , sld and the tevatron , and with the planned upgrades of the accelerators as well as the experiments , the projected uncertainties on some fundamental parameters , especially the @xmath2 mass ,",
    "should provide the tools to take another ever more critical look at the @xmath4 , without any theoretical prejudice .",
    "i would like to thank debbie errede , bob wagner and darien wood who have been very cooperative and the organizers for a very stimulating conference in a splendid setting .",
