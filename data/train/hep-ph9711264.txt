    "the primary motivation for supersymmetry ( susy ) is to stabilize the smallness of the electroweak scale against radiative corrections @xcite , which can be as large as the planck scale if the higgs bosons are truly elementary .",
    "once the electroweak scale is set in the tree - level lagrangian , it only receives logarithmic radiative corrections , and hence its order of magnitude is not changed .",
    "moreover , the electroweak symmetry remains unbroken in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the absence of explicit susy - breaking parameters .",
    "therefore , one can view the electroweak symmetry breaking as being triggered by the soft susy breaking .",
    "indeed , the soft susy - breaking mass - squared of the higgs boson can be driven negative due to the top quark loop @xcite while all the other scalar bosons still have positive mass - squared . in this sense",
    ", there is nothing special about the higgs boson .",
    "it is just one of many scalar bosons , which happens to acquire a negative mass - squared due to the top quark loop .",
    "this idea eliminates one of the least appealing features of the standard model . however , there are at least two open questions .",
    "first , susy by itself does not explain why the electroweak scale is small to begin with .",
    "therefore , susy makes the smallness of the electroweak scale `` technically natural , '' but not truly natural .",
    "second , the mssm contains one dimensionful parameter ( the @xmath0-parameter ) , allowed by susy , in the superpotetial .",
    "the natural values of @xmath0 are either the planck mass ( the only natural dimensionful parameter available ) or zero , but recent experimental constraints imposed by lep2 imply that a nonzero @xmath3  gev is required @xcite .",
    "susy , fortunately , can potentially explain the smallness of the electroweak scale if it is broken dynamically @xcite .",
    "the perturbative non - renormalization theorem forbids the generation of a mass scale in the superpotential if it is absent at the tree - level",
    ". however , non - perturbative effects can violate the non - renormalization theorem , and a mass scale can be generated by a dimensional transmutation : @xmath4 , if an asymptotically free gauge theory is responsible for susy breaking .",
    "there has been major progress in building models of dynamical susy breaking @xcite , which became possible with the detailed understanding of the non - perturbative dynamics of susy gauge theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the so - called gauge mediation of susy breaking ( gmsb ) @xcite can generate soft susy - breaking parameters in the susy standard model in a phenomenologically desired form .",
    "therefore , there is hope of understanding the smallness of the electroweak scale in a truly natural manner .",
    "however , the other question remains largely unanswered : how can the dimensionful parameters in the superpotential naturally be of the order of the susy - breaking parameters ?",
    "there have been extensive discussions on this subject in the literature which we briefly summarize in section 2 .",
    "unfortunately , many of the proposed mechanisms rely on either small parameters , accidental cancellations , or the absence of interactions allowed by symmetries .",
    "we find the current situation to be rather unsatisfactory .",
    "a natural direction to follow is to start with a superpotential which does not contain a dimensionful parameter and hope that the electroweak scale is generated solely due to the soft susy - breaking parameters .",
    "the simplest model which can potentially work along this line is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , which replaces the @xmath0-parameter by the vacuum expectation value of an electroweak singlet superfield .",
    "we revisit this possibility with detailed quantitative studies in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , our conclusion is negative .",
    "the nmssm by itself does not produce a phenomenologically viable electroweak symmetry breaking even if we vary the messenger scale .",
    "the major experimental constraints include higgs boson and slepton searches .",
    "certain simple modifications can evade phenomenological constraints , but require a cancellation among parameters accurate to a few percent .",
    "we present all of these points quantitatively in this paper , and hope that our results prompt further investigations in understanding the origin of the @xmath0-parameter in models with the gmsb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the situation of the @xmath0-problem in models with the gmsb , and discuss various proposals to explain the origin of the @xmath0-parameter . we , however , find none of them entirely satisfactory . even if we accept one of the proposed models , it is still necessary to check whether the generated @xmath0-parameter is phenomenologically allowed .",
    "we address this question in section  3 , and find that the currently available experimental lower bounds on superparticle masses already require a cancellation of order @xmath1% between the @xmath0-parameter and soft susy - breaking parameters to reproduce the observed @xmath5 .",
    "then , as the major part of our study , we present the quantitative results of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the nmssm with the gmsb in section  4 and find that there is no phenomenologically viable parameter set even if we vary the messenger scale from @xmath6 to @xmath7  gev .",
    "we study various simple modifications of the nmssm in section  5 , and find that they either do not break electroweak symmetry in a phenomenologically viable manner or require a cancellation among parameters of order @xmath8 .",
    "we finally conclude in section  6 .",
    "in this section , we review the @xmath0-problem in the supersymmetric standard model in general , and also various attempts to solve it in the context of the gmsb .    the parameter @xmath0 is the only dimensionful quantity present in the superpotential of the mssm @xmath9 here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the matter chiral superfields with the obvious notation , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 the higgs doublets .",
    "note that @xmath0 is part of the supersymmetric lagrangian , and hence its origin is , naively , unrelated to the origin of the soft susy - breaking terms @xmath17 phenomenology , on the other hand , dictates that the values of both @xmath0 and the soft susy - breaking masses should be around the weak scale ( 100 gev ) , if susy is to be responsible for stabilizing the higgs mass .",
    "therefore , the important question is how the mechanism of susy breaking can induce a @xmath0-parameter naturally , at the same order of magnitude as the other soft susy - breaking parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "one popular scenario of susy breaking is the so - called `` hidden sector '' susy breaking in supergravity ( sugra ) @xcite . in hidden sector models , susy is broken in the hidden sector by some mechanism , such as the polonyi model @xcite , gaugino condensation @xcite , or the orafeartaigh model @xcite , and the effects of susy breaking are mediated to the fields in the supersymmetric standard model only by interactions suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "it therefore requires susy breaking at a scale @xmath18  gev if the soft susy - breaking masses are generated as @xmath19 .",
    "this class of models is able to generate the appropriate soft susy - breaking masses and @xmath0-parameter given that the @xmath0-term is forbidden in the supersymmetric limit by appropriate symmetries , and arises due to susy breaking ( see , for example , the giudice ",
    "masiero mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "hidden sector models have , on the other hand , to face serious bounds imposed by flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) @xcite .",
    "low - energy constraints such as the smallness of @xmath20@xmath21 mixing require the matrices @xmath22 , @xmath23 to have eigenvalues degenerate to a few percent , or their eigenvectors to be strongly `` aligned '' with the eigenvectors of the yukawa matrices @xmath24 ( the same is true for @xmath25 ) . within the sugra framework alone , there is no natural mechanism to guarantee the degeneracy or the alignment @xcite . in this case ,",
    "flavor symmetries are probably necessary to ensure either degeneracy @xcite or alignment @xcite and suppress fcnc , and some of the models presented are also capable of generating the @xmath0-term through flavor symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility that string theory generates degenerate squark masses if , for instance , the dilaton field provides the dominant contribution to the soft susy - breaking masses @xcite .",
    "the gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking is an alternative mechanism which can naturally ensure the degeneracy of squarks masses and therefore suppress the dangerous fcnc effects .",
    "susy is somehow broken ( hopefully dynamically via dimensional transmutation to generate a large hierarchy ) , and susy - breaking effects are mediated to the fields in the supersymmetric standard model by the standard model gauge interactions . mediating susy breaking via gauge interactions is not a novel idea @xcite .",
    "it allows for susy breaking at a lower scale ( when compared to sugra inspired models ) and , because all susy - breaking effects are transmitted by flavor blind interactions ( the standard model gauge interactions ) , squarks of different families have the same mass .",
    "this scheme has attracted a lot of interest after the pioneering works by the authors of references @xcite , which showed that one can successfully mediate the susy - breaking effects via gauge interactions with the help of a so - called `` messenger sector . ''",
    "their scheme can easily incorporate dynamical susy breaking and can explain the origin of the large hierarchy between the planck ( string , grand unified ( gut ) ) scale and the weak scale .",
    "the gmsb itself , however , has nothing to say about the @xmath0-parameter unless one introduces extra fields which couple to the particle content of the mssm .",
    "the @xmath0-problem in the gmsb is the primary interest of this paper .",
    "many solutions to the @xmath0-problem have been suggested by different authors and all of them require the introduction of new fields and/or interactions . some of these solutions will be reviewed shortly .    in the original models",
    "@xcite , susy is broken dynamically in a so - called susy - breaking sector and the breaking effects are transmitted to the supersymmetric standard model via a messenger sector .",
    "the energy scale of the messenger sector is given by @xmath26@xmath27  gev .",
    "there are , however , models which do not have a separate messenger sector so that the sector which breaks susy dynamically is directly coupled to the standard model gauge group @xcite . in this case",
    ", the effective messenger scale tends to be much higher . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to employ a simple version of the messenger sector , as in the original models , and take the messenger scale @xmath28 as a free parameter .",
    "the messenger sector can be described by the superpotential @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a singlet superfield , @xmath31 are charged under a @xmath32 associated with the susy - breaking sector and are singlets under the standard model @xmath33 gauge group .",
    "the superfield @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) transforms as a @xmath36 under the standard model , while @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) transforms as @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that the scalar components of @xmath31 acquire negative susy - breaking masses - squared due to its interaction with the susy - breaking sector ( usually accomplished by the so - called `` messenger @xmath32 '' gauge interaction @xcite ) , and the potential associated with the scalar component of @xmath30 reads @xmath40 neglecting terms containing @xmath37 or @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to see that the scalar and the @xmath41 components of @xmath30 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 and therefore @xmath34 and @xmath37 acquire supersymmetric masses proportional to @xmath44 and susy - breaking masses - squared proportional to @xmath43 .",
    ", @xmath45 in this potential @xcite .",
    "this problem can be avoided by introducing more @xmath30 fields to the messenger sector .",
    "such details are , however , irrelevant for the rest of our discussion . ]",
    "this effect feeds down to the mssm through loop corrections .",
    "gauginos acquire majorana masses at one loop , while sfermions acquire susy - breaking masses - squared at two loops .",
    "the calculation of these soft susy - breaking parameters was done long ago ( see @xcite ) and its result is well known . at the messenger scale : @xmath46 @xmath47 here and below , all @xmath48 are in the @xmath49 normalization , @xmath50 in the messenger sector discussed above , and @xmath51 determines the number of messenger sector superfields responsible for mediating susy breaking . in the example we described above , which will be referred to as the model with the minimal gmsb , @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the hypercharge of the particle , @xmath54 for weak @xmath55 doublets ( zero for singlets ) and @xmath56 for color triplets ( zero for color singlets ) .",
    "( [ sfermionmass ] ) guarantees that squarks of different families are degenerate at the messenger scale and therefore fcnc effects are safely suppressed .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for small @xmath51 , gaugino masses and sfermion masses are comparable . for very large @xmath51 , on the other hand , sfermion masses can be significantly smaller than gaugino masses ( by a factor @xmath57 ) .    in the mechanism described above",
    ", trilinear couplings are not generated at the same order ( in loop expansion ) at the messenger scale .",
    "this is not the case in general , and some models can generate trilinear couplings with values comparable to the other soft susy - breaking parameters even at the messenger scale @xcite .",
    "we will , for most of our discussions , consider @xmath58 unless otherwise noted .",
    "the gmsb does not generate a @xmath0-term because of the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "therefore @xmath0 is an input of the model , and , because it has dimensions of mass , its only nonzero natural value is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is clearly not allowed phenomenologically .",
    "the @xmath0-term must , therefore , be forbidden at the planck scale ( by , say , a @xmath62 symmetry ) and generated dynamically .",

    "in this section we study the feasibility of implementing the gmsb in the framework of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "we begin our presentation by introducing the nmssm : its particle content , superpotential , and soft susy - breaking terms .",
    "we briefly review the major steps in our analysis : the boundary conditions for the breaking terms , the rg evolution , and the minimization of the weak - scale one - loop effective potential .",
    "we then describe the results of a numerical scan of a large portion of the model s parameter space .",
    "we find that it is impossible to evade the present - day experimental constraints .",
    "we further strengthen this argument by providing a semi - analytical explanation for the inevitability of this conclusion .",
    "the nmssm represents an attempt to solve the @xmath0-problem of the mssm in the simplest and most direct way : the spectrum of the mssm is augmented by a gauge singlet superfield _",
    "n _ , which couples to @xmath225 and plays the role of the @xmath0-term once it develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xcite .",
    "the original @xmath0-term is banned from the theory so that there are no dimensionful parameters left in the superpotential .",
    "the vev of the scalar component of _ n _ is determined by minimizing the scalar potential with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath88 simultaneously .",
    "it is natural to expect the vevs to be of the same order of magnitude for all three fields , thus generating an effective @xmath0-parameter of order the weak scale , as required by phenomenology .",
    "the complex scalar _",
    "n _ introduces two additional degrees of freedom to the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , the particle spectrum of the nmssm contains three cp  even higgs scalars , two cp  odd higgs scalars , and one charged higgs scalar .",
    "immediately , there is a problem : one of the pseudoscalar higgs bosons is massless .",
    "this happens because the superpotential @xmath226 has a peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath227 .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vevs of the fields , making one of the pseudoscalars massless .",
    "the standard solution to this problem is to introduce a term cubic in _",
    "n _ , which explicitly breaks the symmetry mentioned above .",
    "this term is allowed by the gauge symmetries of the model and does not contain a dimensionful coupling constant , so it is generically expected to be present in the superpotential .",
    "one , however , still has to worry about a light pseudoscalar higgs boson . as we will show shortly ,",
    "its mass can also be small because of the presence of a different ( approximate ) @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "overall , the only change made to the mssm superpotential is the following : @xmath228 while the corresponding change to the soft susy - breaking part of the potential is : @xmath229    one can determine the vevs of the higgs fields @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath88 by minimizing the scalar potential , which at the tree - level consists of the @xmath41-terms , @xmath182-terms , and soft susy - breaking terms : @xmath230 an important fact to notice is that both @xmath231 and @xmath232 remain unchanged when @xmath233 are all rotated by the same phase .",
    "in fact , only the soft susy - breaking @xmath93-terms are not invariant under this transformation .",
    "this can be potentially dangerous , because we , in general , consider the @xmath93-terms to be zero at the messenger scale , and their sizes at the weak scale are determined by the rg evolution . if the generated values of @xmath234 and @xmath235 are not large enough , our scalar potential has an approximate @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , and , as before , we have to worry about a light pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "we denote the vevs of the neutral components of the higgs fields by @xmath236 and @xmath237 , as in section  [ mssmsection ] , and the vev of the singlet field by _ x _ : @xmath238 as a function of these vevs , the potential has the form @xmath239    it is well known that some of the higgs boson masses receive significant contributions from radiative corrections . in our numerical analysis we account for that by employing the one - loop effective potential @xmath240 in this expression @xmath241 is a field - dependent scalar mass - squared matrix , and @xmath0 is the @xmath242 renormalization scale .",
    "as we have indicated explicitly , the values of the various parameters entering @xmath243 depend on the choice of this scale .",

    "what plays a crucial role here is not the absolute values of the masses , but rather the rate of their change as one changes @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , the most important contribution comes from the field - dependent masses of the top quark and squarks , which have the largest yukawa coupling . denoting their mass eigenvalues by @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively ,",
