    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) [ salpeter ( 1955 ) , miller & scalo ( 1979 ) , scalo ( 1986 ) , kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1990 ) , ... ] is the distribution of stellar masses at @xmath3 .",
    "it is mainly characterized by three parameters : the upper mass cutoff @xmath4 , the lower mass cutoff @xmath5 , and the slope @xmath6 .",
    "the values of @xmath7 depend on the physical processes that lead to the formation of stars and hence may not be `` universal '' but depend rather significantly on the environment , i.e. , the global parameters of the region .",
    "an increasing number of theoretical and semi - empirical approaches try to explain the stellar mass spectrum , e.g. , silk ( 1977 ) , padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , murray & lin ( 1996 ) , elmegreen ( 1998 ) , adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) , bonnell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , myers ( 2000 ) , and recent models discussed at this conference . despite numerous and diverse approaches none of the concepts seems to be capable of predicting the stellar mass spectrum under the extreme conditions in starbursts .",
    "hence , observational input is needed !",
    "evidence for a different imf in star - forming regions has been found in several observational studies : the element abundances in spiral arms / interarm regions ( @xmath8 [ gsten & mezger 1982 ] ) , the metal abundances in galaxy clusters ( @xmath9 top - heavy imf ) , cooling flows in galaxy clusters ( @xmath9 bottom - heavy imf ) , and studies of isolated lmc / smc associations ( @xmath10 [ massey et al . 1995 ] ) .",
    "maybe the strongest support for a substantially higher low - mass cut - off in starbursts came from a comparison of radiation _ and _ gravitation for m82 , suggesting @xmath11 ( rieke et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , starburst modelling is a tricky business and depends on various assumptions , and a similar analysis of m82 by satyapal et al .",
    "( 1995 ) did not confirm the high value of @xmath5 .",
    "a `` definite flattening below @xmath12 '' of the imf in 30  doradus was found by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , based on very deep v and i broadband wfpc2 images from the hst archive . ]",
    "recently , sirianni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have investigated the low - mass end of the imf around r136 based on very deep wfpc2 images in v and i band from the hst archive and extended the mass range below hunter et al.s ( 1995 ) limit of @xmath13 .",
    "the authors find that `` after correcting for incompleteness , the imf shows a definite flattening below @xmath12 '' ( fig .",
    "[ sirianni ] ) .",
    "however , their conclusion is based only on regions @xmath14pc _ around _ r136 and it remains unclear whether the conditions there are still representative of dense starburst cores . on the other hand , most stars less massive than @xmath15 show varying amounts of extinction due to circumstellar disks or envelopes , which",
    " if the observations are performed at optical wavelengths  require a magnitude - limit correction ( selman et al .",
    "1999 ) in addition to correction for incompleteness",
    ".     infrared luminosity function ( f160w , nic2 ) for `` wing  2 '' in 30  dor . ` selected stars ' refers to stars with a magnitude error @xmath16  mag were considered ( solid line ) [ zinnecker et al . 1998 ] . ]",
    "most observational methods used to study starburst regions are based on nebular emission lines , far - ir fluxes , uv stellar winds , and red supergiant spectral features  diagnostics which are most sensitive to ob stars with little information on the low - mass star content . the best way to get",
    "an accurate census of the entire stellar population is through the detection of individual stars by means of high angular resolution techniques at near - ir wavelength .",
    "the near - ir is the ideal wavelength range for these studies since extinction is significantly reduced ( @xmath17 , rieke & lebofsky [ 1985 ] ) and the difference in luminosity between young stars spanning three orders of magnitude in mass is reduced by a large factor compared to optical wavelengths , while still providing sufficient theoretical angular resolution on large telescopes .    the range of regions with intense star formation stretches from ultra - luminous galaxies to massive hii regions .",
    "unfortunately , only the closest regions provide the possibility to identify stars in the sub - solar mass range .",
    "however , recent studies of starburst galaxies using the short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) onboard esa s infrared space observatory iso ( thornley et al . 2000 ) and complementary ground - based near - ir spectroscopy ( frster - schreiber 1998 ) indicate that starburst activity occurs on parsec scales in regions of various sizes and locations which have very similar properties .",
    "we conclude that 30  doradus and ngc  3603 are representative building blocks of more distant and luminous starbursts , and use them to address the following questions : + @xmath18 is the stellar population produced in starbursts significantly different from the stars born in less violent evironments ?",
    "+ @xmath18 do low- and high - mass stars form simultaneously ? + @xmath18 what is the spatial distribution of low- and high - mass stars",
    "? + @xmath18 do low - mass stars form at all ?",
    "with @xmath19 of gas , ionized by @xmath20 lyman - continuum photons / s ( kennicutt 1984 ) , and a surface brightness of @xmath21 at its core r136 , 30  doradus is the most luminous starburst region in the local group . at a distance of 53kpc it is possible to spatially resolve most of the stellar content of its ionizing cluster ngc2070 , which contains about 2400 ob stars ( parker 1993 ) .",
    "we observed the 30  doradus region with nicmos onboard hst during 26 orbits to establish the h - band luminosity function down to the faintest practical limit .",
    "most observations were carried out with the nic2 camera which provides a @xmath22/pixel scale ( @xmath23 field of view , fov ) .",
    "although slightly undersampled , we ve chosen this mode because of its superior sensitivity and large field of view .",
    "the observations consist of a @xmath24 mosaic centered on r136 , and two @xmath25 wings extending away from the core .",
    "all observations were obtained in multiaccum mode ( see zinnecker & moneti ( 1998 ) for details ) and four dithered images were obtained for each position to remove bad pixels , cosmic rays , and the coronographic hole .",
    "photometry was measured with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "no color correction or conversion from f160w to a `` standard '' h - magnitude has been made ; however , comparisons with ground - based magnitudes for individual stars in r136 ( brandl et al . 1996 ) indicate photometric uncertainties of @xmath16  mag ( zinnecker et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the main goal of these observations was to establish the first deep infrared luminosity function of the 30  doradus region  our `` wing  2 '' is located northwest at @xmath26 from r136 where crowding is less severe .",
    "we have detected _ for the first time _ pre - main sequence stars below @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosity function shows an apparent turnover  probably due to incompleteness  at around @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ nic2lumi ] ) . for the range from @xmath29 where our sample is almost complete we determined the imf slope",
    "@xmath30 using the time - dependent pre - ms mass - luminosity - relation @xmath31 for an assumed cluster age of 2  myr , based on dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) tracks and dwarf colors .",
    "we find @xmath32 , which is flatter than the salpeter imf slope of @xmath33 , but very similar to @xmath34 found in ngc  3603 by eisenhauer et al .",

    "the error bars are purely statistical based on the number of detected stars .",
    "the upper right part of both diagrams indicates the according pre - ms stellar masses of @xmath38 for ages reaching from 1 to 2.5  myr ( palla & stahler 1999 ) . ]",
    "most importantly perhaps , our results do not confirm the finding by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) mentioned above , i.e. , we find no clear evidence for a significant turnover above @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the nic2 data we ve also obtained nic1 ( @xmath39/pixel ) images for better spatial sampling on the central @xmath40 around r136 . the resulting image is composed of four exposures of 960s each and shown in fig .  [ nic1image ] .",
    "due to the significant crowding and extended diffraction structure in the nicmos psf we ve chosen a different analysis approach : in the first step we analyzed the images with daofind ( stetson 1987 ) to detect the positions of the brightest sources .",
    "next we used plucy ( hook et al .",
    "1994 ) to derive the photometric fluxes for these sources and produce a map from which the detected sources have been removed .",
    "plucy accounts for the full structure of the psfs within the fov  this is important in our case where very faint objects are close to the diffraction spikes of a bright point source .",
    "the plucy output map was used for subsequent source position detections using daofind . the resulting source list and the original source list",
    "were combined and plucy was run again .",
    "these steps were repeated iteratively 4 times . in total we found about 1850 sources in the field .    despite this sophisticated approach",
    "the non - detection of an existing source due to crowding is the limiting factor in this analysis .",
    "we determined the level of incompleteness by randomly adding artificial stars with a flux distribution following the salpeter imf and density following approximately the cluster profile to the original image and reanalyzing it through the same procedures as the original image . to avoid introducing systematic errors by adding a large number of stars at once we added only 350 stars at one time and repeated the analysis two times , which makes it a time consuming procedure .",
    "we determined the detection probability as a function of apparent magnitude and distance from the cluster center and applied this correction factor to the number of stars detected in each luminosity bin . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "significant no statement can be made .    inside the central parsec ( @xmath41 ) we detect about a thousand sources .",
    "the luminosity function in the core is flatter compared to the outer parts of the cluster . for @xmath42 less than 10% of the sources  whether they exist there or not  can be detected , and incompleteness due to crowding does _ not _ permit us to reach below @xmath43 .",
    "the only way to go significantly deeper in the center is to either wait for ngst and high - order adaptive optics on 8 m class telescopes , or to study targets which are very similar to but closer than r136 .",
