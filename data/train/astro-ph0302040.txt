    "the anomalous velocity clouds of neutral hydrogen known as the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) may represent the continuing infall of matter onto the local group ( oort 1966 ; verschuur 1969 ; blitz  1999 ) .",
    "the distances to the majority of these clouds remains unknown , but in the local group scenario the distances would range from a few kpc ( for gas currently accreting onto the galaxy ) to beyond andromeda ( @xmath10 mpc ) .",
    "hvcs range in size from @xmath11 deg@xmath12 , and it is possible that the sizes reflect their distance from the galaxy .",
    "in particular , some of the hvcs are both compact and isolated from extended emission , and show many similar hi properties to dwarf galaxies .",
    "these are referred to as compact hvcs ( chvcs ) and may be the pristine building blocks of the local group at @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the survival and composition of these chvcs against photoionization depends on their volume densities ( and therefore distances ) and the strength of the extragalactic ionizing photon flux .",
    "the presence of an extragalactic ionizing radiation field is inferred from several sets of observations .",
    "maloney ( 1993 ) used a deep  observation of ngc 3198 ( van gorkom 1993 ) , which shows a sharply truncated neutral hydrogen disk at @xmath13 , to infer that the flux in the energy range @xmath14 to @xmath15 ev is approximately @xmath16 .",
    "estimates from the proximity effect at low redshift ( kulkarni & fall 1993 ; scott  2002 ) , upper limits from sensitive h@xmath17 observations ( madsen 2001 ; weymann  2001 ) , and theoretical estimates based on known sources ( haardt & madau 1996 ; shull  1999 ) are in agreement with a value @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we examine the ionization state of the compact high - velocity clouds at various distances , subject to an extragalactic ionizing radiation field . in the original local group model , the chvcs",
    "are confined by dark matter halos , with @xmath19 . in a more recent variant of this model",
    ", it is suggested that the chvcs are condensations in an intragroup medium , bound by external pressure ( blitz , private communication ) .",
    "we therefore consider both constant gas density models and dark matter - dominated models .",
    "the  properties of the chvcs are briefly reviewed in section 2 and the photoionization model is described in section 3 .",
    "the results of the models are presented in section 4 , and in section 5 we discuss the implications of the results .",
    "the  properties of the chvcs are taken from the  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) hvc catalog of putman  ( 2002 ) .",
    "this is a catalog of high - velocity clouds with declination @xmath20 and @xmath21 , excluding emission with @xmath22  to avoid confusion with galactic emission .",
    "the spatial resolution of the survey is @xmath23 and the velocity resolution is 26 .",
    "the @xmath24 column density sensitivity of the hvc hipass data is @xmath25 , which we adopt as a cutoff .",
    "barnes ( 2001 ) give a full description of hipass .",
    "the original chvc catalog of braun & burton ( 1999 ) was based on data of lower resolution and sensitivity , and 50% of the chvcs in the region of overlap between the two catalogs were reclassified based on the hipass data . in order for a high - velocity cloud to be considered a compact and isolated chvc in the hipass catalog , it must have a diameter at 25% of the peak column density less than 2 , and must not be elongated in the direction of any extended emission . the typical parameters of a hipass chvc are an angular size of 0.36 deg@xmath12 ( to the sensitivity limit ) , a total  flux of 19.9 jy , and a typical peak column density of @xmath26 .",
    "there are a total of 179 chvcs cataloged from hipass and when this is combined with the northern sky data from the leiden - dwingeloo survey there are approximately 250 chvcs in total ( de heij , braun & burton 2002 ) .",
    "the linewidth distribution shows a prominent peak at a fwhm @xmath27 ( de heij , braun & burton ) .    for most of the results in this paper",
    ", we have used the typical chvc parameters quoted above .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since the distributions in column density , angular size , and velocity are fairly sharply peaked .",
    "an increase or decrease of less than a factor of three in column density away from the peak value produces a drop by a factor of five or more in the number of clouds , and similarly for the cloud areas ( figures 12 and 13 of putman  [ 2002 ] ) .",
    "the linewidth distribution of de heij  ( 2002 ) is less sharply peaked than the column density or angular size distributions , and is skewed to the low - velocity end : @xmath28 of the observed clouds have a fwhm @xmath27 _ or less _ ; less than @xmath29 have @xmath30 in excess of @xmath31 . despite the well - defined typical values , in order to verify that our conclusions are robust to uncertainties in the cloud parameters",
    ", we have also included models in which the peak central column density is up to an order of magnitude larger than the typical chvc value , and the linewidth is doubled to @xmath32 ( see  4.2.2 ) .",
    "the photoionization models of chvcs have been calculated with the code described by maloney ( 1993 ) , modified to allow for the spherical geometry of the chvcs .",
    "( modest  tens of percent  departures from sphericity will have no significant impact on the model results . )",
    "spherical geometry raises the ionization rates substantially over plane - parallel models with the same total hydrogen density ; integration of the ionization rates over angle is done using 10-point gaussian quadrature .",
    "the photoionization equilibrium of a chvc exposed to an isotropic background radiation field is calculated iteratively , including the effects of the diffuse radiation .",
    "thermal equilibrium at t @xmath33 k is assumed , as is appropriate for gas in the warm neutral phase .",
    "an ionizing photon flux @xmath34 has been assumed ; a flux a factor of two smaller would reduce the total gas masses by a factor of @xmath35 ( see below ) .",
    "a radial grid with 100 depth points ( with logarithmic spacing ) was used ; we have verified that this provides adequate accuracy ( less than @xmath36 error in the total column density for a fixed neutral column density ) . in all cases",
    "we have assumed that the only ionizing photon flux is due to the extragalactic background ; depending on the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from the milky way , the galactic ionizing radiation field could dominate for chvc distances @xmath37 kpc ( maloney & bland - hawthorn 1999 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we have considered both models with uniform gas ( total hydrogen ) density  and models where the gas is confined by dark matter potential wells .",
    "we first discuss the constant  models , as these contain much of the relevant physics , and then the models that include dark matter .",
    "if the chvcs were at local group distances ( @xmath10 mpc ) , their volume densities would be @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore consider total hydrogen densities  ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ; as we will see , the low - density end of this range is untenable for reasonable hvc distances .",
    "the model results ( total hydrogen columns , gas masses , etc . ) are given in table 1 .",
    "in figure 1 , we plot the column density of total hydrogen that is required to produce a neutral hydrogen column @xmath41 as a function of the total hydrogen density , when the model chvcs are exposed to our fiducial ionizing photon flux .",
    "the solid curve is for our fiducial ionizing photon flux and the dashed curve is for @xmath42 reduced by a factor of two . at the low density end of the range , the ratio /  is enormous , @xmath43 , in consequence of the small neutral fraction of gas at this density even if exposed only to the extragalactic ionizing background . at the highest densities ,",
    "this ratio has declined to @xmath44 , as the gas is substantially neutral over much of the total column .    since we know both the neutral and total hydrogen column densities as well as the volume densities",
    ", we can calculate the gas masses directly from the models .",
    "however , in order to compare the results to observations , we need to assign distances to the model clouds . to do this ,",
    "we adopt the following procedure . for each model",
    ", we determine the radius at which the projected  column drops to the hipass sensitivity limit of @xmath45 .",
    "we then set the distance by requiring that the apparent angular size ( using this radius ) matches the typical value found for the chvcs in the hipass survey , for which the angular radius @xmath46 degrees .",
    "this gives the result @xmath47 kpc , where @xmath48 is the model radius ( in kpc ) at the @xmath49 level .    in figure 2",
    "we show both the total gas masses  and the apparent masses , the latter derived from the neutral hydrogen column densities and the apparent ( as measured in ) sizes , as a function of the cloud distance and total gas volume density , for our fiducial ionizing photon flux . as is evident from table 1 ,",
    "models in which the total gas density is less than @xmath50 are ruled out , as such clouds are so large that they are required to lie outside of the local group , and the gas masses become absurdly large . at the maximum acceptable distance ( @xmath51 mpc )",
    "the total gas mass is an order of magnitude larger than the apparent  mass .",
    "figure 3 shows the same quantities as in figure 2 , but we now show the results only for clouds within the local group ( @xmath52 mpc ) . in addition , this figure also shows the gas masses for @xmath42 a factor of two smaller than our assumed value . for the lower photon flux ,",
    "clouds of a fixed density are at smaller radius compared to the fiducial model . at a fixed distance ,",
    "the total gas masses are smaller by about a factor of @xmath53 for the reduced flux models . for model chvcs at local group distances ( @xmath54 mpc ) ,",
    "the gas masses are @xmath55 .",
    "there is an additional constraint that we can apply to the chvc models .",
    "the linewidth distribution of chvcs is sharply peaked at a fwhm @xmath56 ( de heij , braun , & burton 2002 ) .",
    "we have therefore calculated the expected line fwhm for the models ( using the velocity dispersion for a self - gravitating system ) , both with and without a dark matter component ( in the former case the total mass has simply been scaled up by the assumed ratio of dark to baryonic mass ) ; @xmath30 has been calculated assuming a uniform spherical mass distribution . in figure 4",
    "we show the predicted line fwhm as a function of distance , for dark matter to gas mass ratios of ten and zero . in the former case ,",
    "the models are consistent with the observations for a distance @xmath57 kpc ; with no dark matter the clouds must lie at approximately 1.5 mpc . for @xmath42",
    "reduced by a factor of two , these distances increase somewhat , to @xmath58 kpc and 2.1 mpc for @xmath59 and no dark matter , respectively .    while these models rule out the possibility that the chvcs sample a population of cosmological objects ( gas in dark matter - dominated potential wells ) at distances characteristic of the local group ( @xmath51 mpc ) , they suggest that they could represent such objects at distances of @xmath60 kpc . however , as we will see in the next section , models of chvcs in realistic dark matter potential wells require that they lie much closer to the galaxy , with an upper limit to the distance of about 200 kpc .",
    "this distance scale rules out models in which the chvcs represent continuing infall onto the local group .",
    "motivated by the order - of - magnitude agreement between the properties of model clouds with @xmath61 and the observations for characteristic distances @xmath62 kpc , we have constructed models of chvcs using realistic dark matter potential wells .",
    "numerical simulations of halo formation in cold dark matter cosmologies predict a specific form for the density profile , as initially found by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , there is considerable disagreement as to whether this profile describes the halos of real galaxies , particularly dwarf and low - surface brightness galaxies ( flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ; burkert 1995 ) .",
    "a number of authors have argued that these latter objects have nearly constant - density cores rather than the cusped power - law nfw density profile , but this point is controversial .",
    "we have therefore adopted two different models for the halo profile .",
    "the first is the the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) halo density profile , but modified to allow for the possible presence of a density core : _",
    "dm(r)=_crit_c r_s(r+r_o)(1+r / r_s)^2 where @xmath63 is the closure density , the scale length @xmath64 is related to the virial radius of the halo by the concentration parameter @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the core radius , and @xmath67 is a characteristic density contrast , determined by the requirement that the halo mass m_h(r_vir)=_crit(4/3)r_vir^3 , where @xmath68 is the overdensity parameter . for a flat ( @xmath69 ) universe , @xmath68 is given by ( eke , navarro , & frenk 1998 ) @xmath70 at @xmath71 for the @xmath72 cosmology adopted here .",
    "for the relevant mass range of halos , @xmath73 .    in the limit of no core , the density contrast is given by the standard result ( eke , navarro , & steinmetz 2001 ) _",
    "c =3 c^3(1+c)-c/(1+c ) . since we have no physical basis for choosing the core radius ( this point is discussed further below ) we have kept the concentration parameter fixed ( for a given halo mass ) at the no - core value , and calculated @xmath67 from the requirement that the integral of equation ( 1 ) to @xmath74 equal the mass given by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the nfw halo parameters ( @xmath75 , @xmath74 ) for a given mass have been calculated using the results of mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) and eke ( 2001 ) .",
    "the second halo mass profile is that suggested by burkert ( 1995 ) based on observations of dwarf galaxies , _",
    "dm(r)=_o r_o^3(r+r_o)(r^2+r_o^2 ) where @xmath76 is the core density and @xmath66 is again the core radius . like the nfw profile",
    ", the density of the burkert halo falls as @xmath77 at large radius .",
    "burkert found that the core density and radius were tightly correlated for the observed galaxies , so that the dark matter profiles are described by only one free parameter , which can be taken to be @xmath66 .",
    "burkert also concluded that the halo virial radius @xmath78 , so that these halos are much less centrally concentrated than the nfw halos .",
    "we have calculated the gas density profile within these halos , including the effects of the gas self - gravity .",
    "the dark matter density profile is fixed , however : we do not include the response of the halo to the gas .",
    "( this would only strengthen our conclusions on the viability of models with dark matter . ) in most cases , the gas velocity dispersion is taken to be @xmath79 , which produces a line fwhm equal to the typical observed value @xmath27 , and is the expected value for gas at @xmath80 k , characteristic of the warm neutral medium . for nfw halos , in the case of no core and negligible gas self - gravity , the gas density profile is given by _",
    "g(r)=_g(0 ) e^c_h where @xmath81 and c_h=4 g _",
    "crit_c r_s^2_g^2=7.3410 ^ -3 _ c r_s^2_g^2 for @xmath64 in kpc and @xmath82 in . for burkert halos",
    "the gas profile is not analytic even in the absence of self - gravity .",
    "we first discuss the results of models with nfw halos , and then the burkert halo models .",
    "the uniform density models that are consistent with a dark matter to baryon ratio of about 10 have total hydrogen volume densities of approximately @xmath83 and total gas masses of about @xmath84 .",
    "we have therefore calculated the gas distribution and the neutral fraction for a halo with a mass @xmath85 .",
    "the virial radius of this halo is 13 kpc and the concentration parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we have also allowed for tidal truncation of the halo due to the galaxy s tidal field ; this introduces a cutoff at a radius of 10.2 kpc .    in figure 5",
    "we show the gas density profile for the model that satisfies the requirement that the peak @xmath41 .",
    "this profile ( which is characteristic of all the halo models ) immediately reveals the problem that plagues all of these models .",
    "most of the gas mass in the halo is at large radius , where the density is low and therefore the neutral fraction is very small .",
    "hence , in order to match the observed neutral column density , the density at the center of the halo must be raised substantially over that in the uniform density model .",
    "as figure 6 ( which plots the cumulative dark matter and gas masses as a function of radius ) demonstrates , this large central gas density results in a gas to dark matter mass ratio of approximately unity within the halo , which is obviously untenable .",
    "this conclusion is unaltered by reducing the ionizing flux by a factor of two or by allowing the dark matter profile to have a core .",
    "although this latter modification results in gas density profiles that are more nearly constant over a larger range in radius , and therefore produce the same total hydrogen column density for a smaller central density , the slower drop - off of  with @xmath87 due to the core means that these models always have a higher value of @xmath88 at the outer boundary than the no - core models .",
    "( in fact , the models with cores invariably require larger total hydrogen columns than the models without cores , which makes the problem even worse . )",
    "the only way to produce reasonable baryon to dark matter ratios in these models is to increase the mass of the halo . in order to produce a model",
    "in which the ratio @xmath88 is less than about 0.1  mpc@xmath89 ( mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "] at the outer boundary _ prior _ to tidal truncation , the halo mass must be @xmath90 .",
    "the mass increase is smaller than the factor of ten one might expect from figure 6 because higher mass halos are both larger than lower mass ones and denser at the same physical radius , and therefore the observed neutral hydrogen column can be produced with a smaller total gas mass than is required in the lower mass halo .",
    "in addition to the mass problem , to which we return below , these nfw dark matter - dominated models suffer from another , severe problem for the cosmological hypothesis : the physical size of the neutral hydrogen distribution is so small that the model chvcs are restricted to lie less than @xmath91 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 7 , which shows the projected  column as a function of impact parameter for a variety of halo masses , core radii , and ionizing fluxes .",
    "_ in no case does the model chvc radius at the hipass threshold , @xmath48 , significantly exceed 1 kpc . _",
    "as discussed in  4.1 , this constrains the clouds to distances of no more than about 200 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "in fact , except for the lowest mass ( @xmath85 ) model shown in figure 7 , which , as discussed above , has an unacceptably large gas to dark matter mass ratio , all of the models have @xmath92 kpc unless we include a core in the halo density distribution .",
    "as we noted earlier , we have no physical basis for choosing the halo core parameters , and have included a core simply to see whether , given the uncertainties in the actual halo dark matter profiles , this could alleviate the problems arising from the small distance scale mandated by the small physical size of the model chvcs . as is evident from figure 7 , it does not .",
    "the reason is simply that if the halo is massive enough that the observed neutral hydrogen column density can be reproduced with a reasonable baryon to dark matter mass ratio , the velocity dispersion of the baryonic component ( which is fixed by the observed linewidth ) is only a fraction of the velocity dispersion characterizing the dark matter potential well , with the result that the gas is confined to the core of the halo .",
    "increasing the size of the core beyond @xmath93 does not lead to any significant further increase in @xmath48 , as is seen in the right - hand panel of figure 7 .      in figure 8",
    "we show results for models with a burkert halo of mass @xmath94 . for these models",
    "we have also explored a larger region of parameters for the chvcs , considering neutral hydrogen columns up to ten times larger than the typical value seen in the hipass survey and linewidths up to a factor of two larger than the typical value .",
    "the left - hand panel assumes the standard velocity dispersion of @xmath95 . from left to right",
    ", we plot the neutral hydrogen column as a function of impact parameter for peak neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath41 ( solid line ) , @xmath96 ( long - dashed line ) , @xmath97 ( dotted line ) , @xmath98 ( short - dashed line ) and @xmath99 ( solid line )",
    ". this burkert halo model does not suffer from the unacceptably high baryon to dark matter mass ratio problem that afflicts the nfw halos of comparable mass , because the burkert halo is physically much smaller ( virial radius of 1.8 kpc compared to 11.7 kpc for the same mass nfw model ) and therefore its mean density is much higher than the corresponding nfw halo .",
    "however , this small size scale becomes a serious problem just as it does for the nfw halos .",
    "even for a peak column @xmath99 , the projected size at the hipass sensitivity threshold barely reaches 1 kpc , again implying that the halos are no more than 200 kpc distant .",
    "the right - hand panel shows the same models , only for a doubled velocity dispersion , so that the line fwhm @xmath100 .",
    "even with this assumption , the physical size of the clouds remains small : raising the peak column density to @xmath101 - five times the typical hipass value - only increases the cloud radius to about 1.6 kpc , which would push the clouds out to no more than 270 kpc .",
    "( lower mass halos - @xmath102 - with burkert profiles are so small that they can lie no further than @xmath103 kpc from the milky way , independent of total column density . )    in figure 9 we present similar results , but for a halo with @xmath104 . in the left - hand panel , with a velocity dispersion corresponding to the typical observed value , the results scarcely differ from those for the @xmath105 halo , and the cloud size at the hipass threshold again never exceeds 1 kpc . the results for the models with twice the linewidth are also very similar to those for the lower mass burkert halo .",
    "the chief difference is that , since the @xmath106 halo is physically larger ( by a factor of 2.7 ) than the @xmath105 halo , the highest column density models are larger in the higher mass model , since the column density cutoff is not set by the physical edge of the halo as it is in the @xmath105 model .",
    "hence the chvc models with burkert halos suffer from the same distance problem as the nfw halo models : the sizes at the hipass sensitivity threshold are simply too small to allow them to be placed at distances much larger than @xmath107 kpc from the milky way .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those of kepner , babul & spergel ( 1997 ) and kepner  ( 1999 ) , who calculated the chemical , thermal , and ionization equilibrium of gas in dark matter minihalos with burkert density profiles .",
    "they found that the characteristic radius at the @xmath108 level never exceeded @xmath109 kpc , even when the central hydrogen column density reached values much larger than any we consider here .",
    "the combination of these two factors ( the large mass that is required in order to have plausible gas to dark matter ratios for nfw halos , and the close distances required by the small physical size of the clouds for either nfw or burkert halos ) is fatal for any model in which the chvcs represent a population of cosmological objects . in figure 10",
    "we show the halo mass distribution for a cosmological simulation of the local group ( moore  2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath110 halos were created by analyzing the formation of a binary pair of massive halos in a hierarchical universe dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "the masses , separation and relative velocities of the binary halos are close to those observed for the milky way and andromeda .",
    "the binary system was chosen from a large cosmological simulation such that a nearby massive cluster similar to virgo was present .",
    "the simulation is described in detail in moore  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the filled circles show all of the halos ( aside from those representing the milky way and andromeda galaxies ) within the simulated local group volume and the open circles show the halos that lie within 200 kpc of the galaxy . as we showed above , the minimum acceptable mass for chvc halos",
    "is @xmath111 . from this mass limit up to @xmath112 , there are 16 halos in the simulation , as allowed for burkert profile halos , the number of halos would be a few times larger . however ,",
    "except for extreme assumed chvc parameters ( peak column densities and linewidths much larger than the typical values ) , the chvc models with burkert halos will be physically even smaller than those with nfw halos . hence these objects would have to lie closer than 200 kpc , and so the total number predicted would be about the same as for the nfw - halo models . ] to explain the chvcs as cosmological , dark matter - dominated objects , we need approximately 250 . hence unless the hierarchical , cold dark matter - dominated cosmology grossly _ under - predicts _ the number of halos in this mass range , our results do not allow chvcs to represent such a population .",
    "there have now been several detailed studies of the hi structure of chvcs .",
    "wakker & schwarz ( 1991 ) investigated two chvcs and were the first to notice the core / halo structure of the clouds .",
    "braun & burton ( 2000 ) imaged six chvcs at 1@xmath113 resolution and found compact cores with linewidths as low as 2 - 10 , as well as the large diffuse halo modeled here with linewidths of @xmath114 .",
    "the warm ( @xmath33 k ) halos were imaged at 3@xmath113 resolution with arecibo by burton , braun & chengalur ( 2001 ; hereafter bbc ) .",
    "they argued that the column density distribution at the edges of the clouds ( for  @xmath115 ) drops off as an exponential with radius , indicating a spherical exponential distribution of neutral hydrogen volume density as a function of radius .",
    "( figures 11 and 12 of bbc demonstrate the quality of the exponential fits . )",
    "kinematically the cores and halos of the chvcs do not appear to be related .",
    "bbc derived distances of typically a few hundred kpc for the clouds in their sample , based on the following assumptions :    * the neutral gas density distribution is reasonably well - described by an exponential with radius , so that the central density can be inferred from the peak column density and the fit scalelength ; * the gas neutral fraction is close to unity in the center of the chvc , and the temperature @xmath80 k ; * the total gas pressure at the center is @xmath116 @xmath117 k , which braun & burton ( 2000 ) argued is the characteristic pressure at which the cold cores can co - exist with the warm neutral medium .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the angular scale length of the exponential can be converted to a physical scale length , thereby yielding a cloud distance .    in this section",
    "we show that the characteristic exponential  profile arises as a simple consequence of the physics of photoionization , and in the absence of fine - tuning of conditions , is very unlikely to provide reliable distance estimates .",
    "in figure 11 we plot the projected neutral hydrogen column density as a function of impact parameter ( normalized to the cloud radius ) for five different uniform density models , with total densities  between @xmath39 and @xmath118 .",
    "for all of these models the profile resembles an exponential over most of the cloud radius , with the exception of a core which becomes more pronounced with increasing density , and of a cutoff as the cloud outer boundary is approached .",
    "the exponential appearance of the  column density distribution indicates that the neutral hydrogen volume density distribution is also approximately an exponential , at least over a substantial fraction of the cloud volume .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the photoionization physics , and reflects the attenuation of the ionizing radiation ( and therefore the increase in the neutral fraction ) with depth into the clouds ; the total gas volume densities in all these models are uniform .",
    "bbc fit  profiles of the form ( p)=2 n_o h(ph)k_1(p / h ) to their observations , where @xmath119 is the impact parameter , @xmath120 is the central density , @xmath121 is the scale - length , and @xmath122 is a modified bessel function .",
    "this is the form expected for an exponential volume density distribution of infinite extent ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .",
    "this is modified for a cloud of finite extent , however , and so instead we use the finite - cloud profile ( p)=2 n_o h(ph)where @xmath123 is the cloud radius and @xmath124 is an incomplete bessel function , k_1(,x)=_1^x e^-t(t^2 - 1)^1/2dt which goes to the usual @xmath125 as @xmath126 .    in figure 12",
    "we show two examples of fits of equation ( 8) to the projected neutral hydrogen column density distributions for the chvc models described in  4.1 .",
    "these are not formal fits to the distributions , and are intended solely to show that these uniform density models are very well described over a large range in radius ( in fact , everywhere except for the cores ) by an exponential distribution .",
    "although bbc argued based on observations of dwarf galaxies that there is a characteristic value of @xmath121 , that conclusion does not hold for these models , as @xmath121 depends nontrivially on the volume density . for the pair of models shown in figure 12 , which differ in  by a factor of two , the fitted values of @xmath121 differ by nearly a factor of four .",
    "the bbc distance method generally yields erroneous results when applied to these models , for two reasons : ( 1 ) many of the chvc models have substantial ionized fractions even in their cores , so that the central neutral density - even if determined with reasonable accuracy from the exponential fit - can be substantially below the actual total gas density , and ( 2 ) the central pressure is generally not equal to @xmath116 @xmath117 k. model , for which @xmath127 does equal 100 at cloud center , the bbc distance method gives a result within about @xmath128 of the value assigned to the cloud ( @xmath129 kpc , table 1 ) in order to make its angular size match the typical hipass size , provided that the true central column density is used , rather than the fitted column density , since in these relatively high - density models the presence of a core means that the exponential fit overestimates the central column density - figures 11 and 12 . ]",
    "it is not at all obvious that the value of @xmath116 quoted by braun & burton ( 2000 ) for the co - existence of cold gas with the warm neutral medium is generally applicable .",
    "this conclusion was based on a phase diagram calculated by wolfire  ( priv .",
    "comm . ) for `` local group conditions '' , which are not otherwise specified . in the calculations of wolfire  ( 1995a , b ) , which presumably use similar physics ,",
    "gas heating is dominated by grain photoelectric heating , and the only source of ionizing photons is the extragalactic soft x - ray background , which produces an ionizing flux about an order of magnitude smaller than assumed here .",
    "furthermore , the resulting phase diagram is rather sensitive to the adopted gas parameters ( see figures 1 and 6 in wolfire  1995b , in which the range of pressures over which a two - phase medium is allowed can extend over three orders of magnitude ) . in fact , in the phase diagram presented by braun & burton ( their figure 13 ) , the minimum pressure @xmath130 for which the cold phase exists is approximately five times larger ( @xmath131 @xmath117 k ) for a chvc warm gas column density @xmath41 , as appropriate for the hipass chvcs discussed here , than it is for @xmath99 ( for which @xmath132 is actually about 60 ) , as adopted by braun & burton for their sample .",
    "this would reduce the inferred distances by a factor of three .",
    "it is also not yet clearly established that the presence of cold gas is a generic property of chvcs : there are only six clouds in the braun & burton ( 2000 ) sample , and while all of these exhibit cold cores , a much larger sample is clearly needed .",
    "the magellanic stream shows no evidence for cold gas ( mebold  1991 ) .",
    "interestingly , the models in which the gas is confined by a dark matter potential are not well described by profiles of the form ( 7 ) or ( 8) . we show one such nfw model in figure 13 .",
    "this is the @xmath133 , no - core model shown as the solid line in the center panel of figure 7 .",
    "inspection of that figure shows that the shape of the neutral hydrogen column density distribution in these dark matter - dominated models is generic . as is evident from figure 13 ,",
    "these models can not be described by a single component of the form ( 7 ) or ( 8) . this is because the neutral hydrogen column density always exhibits a core with an extended wing , in consequence of the gas density profiles in these halos ( figure 5 ) .",
    "hence the profile fit to the core of the  distribution ( we have used equation ( 7 ) for these models , since the models are actually much larger than the plotted region , and hence the cutoff is unimportant here ) , shown by the dashed line in figure 13 , grossly under - predicts  outside @xmath134 kpc , while the fit to the column density distribution at larger radius ( dotted line ) falls an order of magnitude short of at @xmath135 .",
    "the results for burkert profile halos are similar ; in figure 14 we show the neutral column density distribution for the largest column density model ( @xmath136 ) shown in the lefthand panel of figure 8 ( @xmath137 , @xmath95 km s@xmath89 ) . as for the nfw halo model",
    ", there is no reasonable fit with a single component of the form ( 7 ) or ( 8) ; in fact , the core - halo structure is even more pronounced than in the nfw halo . as before",
    ", fits to the core of the  distribution ( here we had to use equation [ 8 ] ) severely underestimate  beyond @xmath138 kpc , while fits to  at large radius underestimate the column density at small radii by an order of magnitude .",
    "models in which the compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ) lie at distances of hundreds of kpc to @xmath1391 mpc from the galaxy have such low volume densities of hydrogen that exposure to the extragalactic ionizing background radiation alone will largely ionize them . for models of uniform density clouds (  4.1 ) , we find that the total hydrogen column needed to produce the typical neutral hydrogen column of @xmath140 ranges between 3 and 200 times ( figure 1 ) as the total hydrogen density varies between @xmath40 and @xmath141 . the total gas masses of these clouds are therefore much larger than the apparent neutral gas masses . to match the typical angular size seen for chvcs in the hipass survey , low - density clouds must be at large distances and have correspondingly large masses . models in which the cloud hydrogen densities are less than @xmath142 are ruled out , as such clouds would have to lie outside the local group ( figures 2 and 3 ) .    at local group distances , @xmath143 mpc ,",
    "the gas mass alone of the individual chvcs would be @xmath144 , and the mass of the observed population would be @xmath145 .",
    "such chvcs could have dark matter / gas mass ratios of only @xmath146 without producing line widths larger than the observed value .",
    "models in which the chvcs are at smaller distances , @xmath62 kpc , with gas masses @xmath147 , appear to be more reasonable , and could be dynamically compatible with plausible ( @xmath148 to 1 ) dark matter to gas mass ratios .",
    "a closer examination of this scenario , however , using realistic dark matter halos , shows that it runs into severe difficulties (  4.2 ) .",
    "this is because : ( 1 ) the sizes of the detectable  clouds are too small ( @xmath149 kpc ) , which requires that the chvcs are at distances @xmath150 kpc ( this is true whether we use nfw profiles or burkert profiles for the halo dark matter density distribution ) ; and ( 2 ) the halo masses required for reasonable ratios of @xmath151 for nfw halos are too large ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "hence the predicted number of such objects in a hierarchical cdm structure formation scenario is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed number of chvcs , and chvcs can not represent a population of infalling , cosmological objects .",
    "we have also examined the suggestion that the approximately exponential  profiles seen in high resolution studies of a sample of chvcs could provide an estimate of the cloud distances (  4.3 ) .",
    "such profiles are a natural consequence of an external source of ionizing photons for clouds with uniform total density .",
    "the derived scale lengths are not constant and depend on the cloud density .",
    "we argue that this technique can not be used to derive distances to the chvcs in a model - independent way , as the scale lengths are not fixed and the alternative assumption of a constant pressure for the chvc population is debatable .",
    "the chvc  profiles can be explained by photoionization even if the clouds are near to the galaxy ( @xmath37 kpc ) .",
    "our models have assumed that the gas is smoothly distributed , and therefore do not include substantial clumping .",
    "this is arguably a plausible assumption for the chvc envelopes that we have modeled in this paper , as the gas in these envelopes presumably is in the warm ( @xmath80 k , as is indicated by the observed linewidths ) neutral phase , and is supported by the generally smooth distributions and reflection symmetry seen in high - resolution studies of the envelopes ( bbc ) .",
    "the only way in which this assumption can be substantially in error , and the gas highly clumped , is if the clumps are in the cold neutral phase , with temperatures of order 100 k. in this case the observed linewidths must reflect bulk motion rather than thermal velocities . since the ( thermal ) linewidths of individual clumps would be @xmath153 , a large number of clumps would need to be present along any given sightline in order to explain the smoothness of the velocity profiles .",
    "such clumps would also have to be substantially smaller than the spatial resolution of the high resolution imaging studies , which frequently do find ( and resolve ) small numbers of cores with narrow linewidths ( bbc ) .",
    "if pressures @xmath154 k are necessary to drive the gas into the cold neutral phase ( bbc ) , then the hydrogen densities must be at least @xmath155 .",
    "it is rather difficult to see how to make such a density structure compatible with the observations .",
    "if the clumps are self - gravitating , then they must have column densities that are much larger than the beam - averaged column densities measured observationally , which requires that the areal filling factor is small even though the filling factor in velocity space must be large to reproduce the observed line profiles .",
    "if they are not self - gravitating , we are left with the question of what confines them ( or generates them , if they are transient objects ) .",
    "hence we consider it unlikely that the chvc envelopes that we have considered in this paper actually consist of dense , cold clumps rather than relatively smooth warm neutral gas .",
    "what possibilities does this leave us with for the nature of chvcs ?",
    "clouds without dark matter located within the confines of the local group are not massive enough to be self - gravitating , and must be either transient or confined by some external medium . either of these scenarios would seem to argue for the chvcs being associated with the galaxy rather than the local group , as both the relatively short dynamical timescale ( @xmath156 years ) and the presence of a confining medium are much more easily understood if the chvcs are connected to the flux of mass and energy through the galactic halo .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the overall similarities of the chvcs to the remainder of the hvc population ( putman  2002 ) . the total and neutral hydrogen gas masses of the entire observed chvc population ( @xmath157 objects ) would be @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively , at @xmath107 kpc , and scale nearly as @xmath160 for smaller distances .",
    "we are grateful to several colleagues , especially nick gnedin and jessica rosenberg , for helpful discussions .",
    "nick kindly provided the software ( written by oleg gnedin ) for calculating the properties of nfw halos .",
