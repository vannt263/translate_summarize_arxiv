    "traditionally , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is often viewed as a coherent state of the atomic field with a definite phase  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are problems with this view , however , related to the fact that the phase of the atomic field is not an observable  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the atomic field is independent of the condensate phase and so the correct coherent state is only defined up to its mean number .",
    "often it is convenient to invoke a symmetry breaking bogoliubov field to select a particular phase , but this does not correspond to any physical field so the procedure is not totally satisfactory in a formal sense .",
    "in addition , a coherent state implies a superposition of number states , whereas in the current single trap experiments  @xcite there is a fixed number of atoms in the trap ( even if we are ignorant of that number ) , and the state of a single trapped condensate must be a number state ( or more precisely , a mixture of number states ) .",
    "both these problems are bypassed by considering a system of two condensates for which the total number of atoms @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "then , a general state of the system is a superposition of number difference states of the form @xmath1 as we now have a well - defined superposition state , we can legitimately consider the relative phase of the two condensates , which is an hermitian observable . indeed ,",
    "the dramatic observation of interference between two coherent bec s  @xcite constitutes a measurement of exactly this . in the absence of atomic collisions , the expansion coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) obey a binomial rather than poissonian distribution as would be expected for a coherent state",
    ".    however , there is a more straightforward objection to the identification of the condensate with a coherent state .",
    "this is that in real experiments , the atoms experience collisions introducing a nonlinearity into the hamiltonian for the system .",
    "we then know immediately that ( unless very strongly damped ) the true state can not be a coherent state , leaving aside issues of absolute versus relative phase . in the first treatment of this question , lewenstein and you  @xcite suggested the condensate is actually in an amplitude quadrature eigenstate . in a fuller analysis , dunningham @xmath2",
    "al  _ @xcite have shown that for positive ( repulsive ) interactions the state is strongly number squeezed , and resembles a bent version of the amplitude squeezed state that minimizes number fluctuations .",
    "this has the potentially observable consequence of increasing the revival time in collapses and revivals of the relative phase  @xcite due to the reduced number variance of the squeezed state .",
    "the approach of dunningham _ et al _ is based on the symmetry breaking picture described above .",
    "their model thus describes the quantum state of a single damped driven condensate with the phase determined by some much larger reference condensate which does not appear in the calculation .",
    "thus while the number squeezing they predict is intuitively natural , the model faces the same formal difficulties mentioned above in relation to symmetry breaking .    in this paper , we combine these two ideas by seeking an accurate description of the ground state beyond the coherent state picture , for a system of two coupled condensates with a fixed total number of atoms .",
    "we do this by reducing the full quantum field theoretical description to an approximate two - mode problem , valid for condensates of a few thousand atoms .",
    "the problem is then well - defined in the senses discussed above : we deal with relative rather than absolute phases , and are able to consider a completely closed system without the complications of driving and damping , so that the ground state is unambiguously a pure state . using a variational approach",
    ", we then find approximate solutions to the two - mode problem which are natural analogues of the single condensate states found by dunningham _",
    "_ our approach also works for negative ( attractive ) interactions and we predict a regime of significant phase squeezing in between the coherent state - like behavior with no interactions , and the schrdinger cat states reported previously @xcite that occur with significant interactions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we briefly summarize the quantum field theory for the two - condensate problem and derive the approximate two - mode hamiltonian . in section  [ sec : outline ] we discuss a representation of the two mode states using the bloch sphere and outline our method for finding the ground state of the system .",
    "we construct the solution in detail in section  [ sec : nonlinear ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our results and compare the predictions of our method with exact solutions for systems with small numbers of atoms .",
    "we consider negative scattering lengths and the associated phase squeezing in section  [ sec : negchi ] before we conclude .",
    "our model describes two condensates of atoms of mass @xmath3 , with a linear josephson coupling and weak nonlinear interactions .",
    "we consider a single trap with the condensates distinguished by their internal atomic state _  _",

    "the bloch states are the analogs in the angular momentum algebra of the standard coherent states of the harmonic oscillator _  _",

    "finally , we project this distribution back on to the sphere , and rotate it to the original mean value which has by now been determined .",

    "this result is well - known , though it is more commonly expressed in the number difference basis  @xcite .",
    "as expected , for vanishing @xmath61 , the traps are equivalent and there is an equal number of atoms in each , whereas for @xmath96 the ground state has more atoms in the weaker trap .",

    "we may always take it to be zero .",
    "the nonlinear problem is much more involved . as indicated earlier , the first step is to perform a rotation of the hamiltonian by an undertermined angle @xmath99 and then project the new hamiltonian into the harmonic oscillator phase plane with operators @xmath100 satisfying @xmath101 = 1.$ ] this procedure can be made rigorous through the concept of a group contraction from the angular momentum hilbert space to the harmonic oscillator hilbert space .",

    "the contraction is made by the identification of operators according to @xmath102 where @xmath103 and the spaces are formally identical in the limit @xmath104 . in the same limit@xmath105",

    "geometrically , we visualize this contraction as a projection from the bloch sphere to the phase plane with the south pole of the sphere coincident with the origin of the phase plane .",
    "note that the coherent amplitude @xmath112 can take values throughout the whole phase plane only in the limit @xmath113 and there is naturally a distortion involved in the projection.physically , by performing the contraction we discard the knowledge that the true ladder of states is bounded at both ends rather than just the lower end .",
    "however , providing the state is localized near the south pole and @xmath114 @xmath115 ( large atom number ) , the distortion is small .",
