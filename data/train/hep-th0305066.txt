    "noncommutative quantum field theories show in most cases a phenomenon called _ uv / ir - mixing _",
    "@xcite which seems to prevent the perturbative renormalisation .",
    "there is an enormous number of articles on this problem , most of them performing one - loop calculations extrapolated to higher order . a systematic analysis of noncommutative ( massive ) field theories at _ any loop order _ was performed by chepelev and roiban @xcite .",
    "they calculated the integral of an arbitrary feynman graph using the parametric integral representation and expressed the result in terms of determinants involving the incidence matrix and the intersection matrix .",
    "they succeeded to evaluate the leading contribution to the determinants in terms of topological properties of _ ribbon graphs _ wrapped around riemann surfaces . in this way a power - counting theorem was established which led to the identification of two power - counting non - renormalisable classes of ribbon graphs .",
    "rings_-type class consists of graphs with classically divergent subgraphs wrapped around the same handle of the riemann surface .",
    "com_-type class consists of planar graphs with external legs ending at several disconnected boundary components with the momentum flow into a boundary component being identically zero .    except for models with enough symmetry , noncommutative field theories are not renormalisable by standard techniques .",
    "one may speculate that the reason is the too nave way of performing the various limits .",
    "namely , a field theory is a dynamical system with infinitely many degrees of freedom defined by a certain limiting procedure of a system with finitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "one may perform the limits formally to the path integral and evaluate it by feynman graphs which are often meaningless .",
    "it is the art of renormalisation to give a meaning to these graphs .",
    "this approach works well in the commutative case , but in the noncommutative situation it seems to be not successful .",
    "a procedure which deals more carefully with the limits is the renormalisation group approach due to wilson @xcite , which was adapted by polchinski to a very efficient renormalisability proof of commutative @xmath1-theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "there are already some attempts @xcite to use polchinski s method to renormalise noncommutative field theories .",
    "we are , however , not convinced that the claimed results ( uv - renormalisability ) are so easy to obtain .",
    "the main argument in @xcite is that the polchinski equation is a one - loop equation so that the authors simply compute an integral having exactly one loop .",
    "it is , however , not true that nothing new happens at higher loop order .",
    "for instance , all one - loop graphs can be drawn on a genus - zero riemann surface .",
    "the entire complexity of riemann surfaces of higher genus as discussed by chepelev and roiban @xcite shows up at higher loop order and is completely ignored by the authors of @xcite .",
    "as we show in this paper , the same discussion of riemann surfaces is necessary in the renormalisation group approach , too .",
    "the mentioned complexity is due to the phase factors described by the intersection matrix which result in convergent but not absolutely convergent momentum integrals . as such it is very difficult to access this complexity by polchinski s procedure @xcite which is based on taking _ norms _ of the contributions .",
    "moreover , chepelev and roiban established the link between power - counting and the topology of the riemann surface via the parametric integral representation , which is based on gauian integrations .",
    "these are not available for polchinski s method where we deal with cut - off integrals . in conclusion , we believe it is extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) to use the exact renormalisation group equation for noncommutative field theories in momentum space . the best one can hope is to restrict oneself to limiting cases where e.g.  the non - planar graphs are suppressed @xcite .",
    "even this restricted model has rich topological features .",
    "fortunately , there exists a base @xmath2 for the algebra under consideration and its treatment by renormalisation group methods , see @xcite . ] where the @xmath3-product is reduced to an ordinary product of ( infinite ) matrices , @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "the interaction @xmath5 can then be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is now an infinite matrix ( with entries of rapid decay ) .",
    "the price for the simplification of the interaction is that the kinetic matrix , or rather its inverse , the propagator , becomes very complicated .",
    "however , in polchinski s approach the propagator is anyway made complicated when multiplying it with the smooth cut - off function @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is an energy scale which varies between the renormalisation scale @xmath10 and the initial scale @xmath11 .",
    "introducing in the bilinear ( kinetic ) part of the action the cut - off function and replacing the @xmath1-interaction by a @xmath9-dependent effective action @xmath12 $ ] , the philosophy is to determine @xmath12 $ ] such that the generating functional @xmath13 $ ] is actually independent of @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we provide the prerequisites to investigate the renormalisation of general non - local matrix models .",
    "we prove a power - counting theorem for the effective action @xmath12 $ ] by solving ( better : estimating ) the polchinski equation perturbatively .",
    "our derivation and solution of the matrix polchinski equation combines the original ideas of @xcite with some of the improvements made in @xcite . in particular , we follow @xcite to obtain @xmath14-independent estimations for the interaction coefficients .",
    "the polchinski equation for matrix models can be visualised by ribbon graphs .",
    "the power - counting degree of divergence of a ribbon graph depends on the topological data of the graph and on two scaling dimensions of the cut - off propagator . in this way",
    ", suitable scaling dimensions provide a simple criterion to decide whether a non - local matrix model has the chance of resulting in a renormalisable or not",
    ". however , having the right scaling dimensions is not sufficient for the renormalisability of a model , because a divergent interaction is parametrised by an infinite number of matrix indices .",
    "thus , a renormalisable model needs further structures which relate these infinitely many interaction coefficients to a finite number of base couplings .    nevertheless , the dimension criterion proven in this paper is of great value .",
    "for instance , it discards immediately the standard @xmath1-models on noncommutative @xmath0 , @xmath15 , in the matrix base .",
    "these models have the wrong scaling dimension , which is nothing but the manifestation of the old uv / ir - mixing problem @xcite .",
    "looking closer at the origin of the wrong scaling dimensions it is not difficult to find a deformation of the free action which has the chance to be a renormalisable model . in the matrix base of the noncommutative @xmath0 ,",
    "the laplace operator becomes a tri - diagonal band matrix .",
    "the main diagonal behaves nicely , but the two adjacent diagonals are `` too big '' and compensate the desired behaviour of the main diagonal . making the adjacent diagonals `` smaller ''",
    "one preserves the properties of the main diagonal and obtains the good scaling dimensions required for a renormalisable model .",
    "the deformation of the adjacent diagonals corresponds to the inclusion of a harmonic oscillator potential in the free field action .",
    "we treat in @xcite the @xmath1-model on noncommutative @xmath16 within the wilson - polchinski approach in more detail .",
    "we prove that this model is renormalisable when adding the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "remarkably , the model remains renormalisable when scaling the oscillator potential in a certain way to zero with the removal @xmath17 of the cut - off .",
    "we prove in @xcite that the @xmath1-model on noncommutative @xmath18 is renormalisable to all orders by imposing normalisation conditions for the physical mass , the field amplitude , the frequency of the harmonic oscillator potential and the coupling constant .",
    "in particular , the harmonic oscillator potential can not be removed from the model .",
    "it gives the explicit solution of the uv / ir - duality which suggests that noncommutativity relevant at short distances goes hand in hand with a different physics at very large distances .",
    "the oscillator potential makes the @xmath1-action covariant with respect to a duality transformation @xcite between positions and momenta .",
    "we stress that the power - counting theorem proven in this paper was indispensable to have from the start the right @xmath1-model for the renormalisation proof @xcite .",
    "many noncommutative field theories have a matrix formulation , too .",
    "we think of fuzzy spaces and @xmath19-deformed models .",
    "our general power - counting theorem can play an important rle in the renormalisation proof of these examples .",
    "we consider a @xmath1-matrix model with a general ( non - diagonal ) kinetic term , @xmath20 & = \\mathcal{v}_d \\big ( \\sum_{m , n , k , l }     \\frac{1}{2 } g_{mn;kl } \\phi_{mn } \\phi_{kl }   + \\sum_{m , n , k , l } \\frac{\\lambda}{4 ! } \\phi_{mn } \\phi_{nk } \\phi_{kl } \\phi_{lm } \\big)\\ ; , \\label{actiong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 . for the noncommutative @xmath0 , @xmath22",

    "the choice of @xmath1 is no restriction but for us the most natural one because we are interested in four - dimensional models .",
    "standard matrix models are given by @xmath25 for reviews on matrix models and their applications we refer to @xcite .",
    "the idea to apply renormalisation group techniques to matrix models is also not new @xcite .",
    "the difference of our approach is that we will not demand that the action can be written as the trace of a polynomial in the field , that is , we allow for matrix - valued kinetic terms .",
    "the only restriction we are imposing is @xmath26 the restriction ( [ restindex ] ) is due to the fact that the action comes from a trace .",
    "it is verified for the noncommutative @xmath0 due to the @xmath27-symmetry of both the interaction and the kinetic term .",
    "the kinetic matrix @xmath28 contains the entire information about the differential calculus , including the underlying ( riemannian ) geometry , and the masses of the model .",

    "it is obvious that all examples not discussed in detail are treated in the same manner .",
    "we conclude that ( [ annorm1 ] ) provides the correct bounds for the interaction coefficients of @xmath1-matrix model with cut - off propagator described by the three exponents @xmath203 .",

    "the momentum integrals leading to the parametric integral representation are not absolutely convergent ; nevertheless one exchanges the order of integration . in momentum space",
    "one can therefore not exclude the possibility that the uv / ir - mixing is due to the mathematically questionable exchange of the order of integration .",
    "the renormalisation group approach to noncommutative field theories in matrix formulation avoids these problems .",
    "we work with cut - off propagators leading to finite sums and take absolute values of the interaction coefficients throughout .",
    "oscillating phases never appear ; they are not required for convergence of certain graphs .",
    "our power - counting theorem provides a necessary condition for renormalisability : the two scaling exponents @xmath193 of the cut - off propagator have to be large enough relative to the dimension of the underlying space . in @xcite we determine these exponents for @xmath1-theory on noncommutative @xmath0 , @xmath15 :    the propagator for the real scalar field on noncommutative @xmath0 , @xmath15 , is characterised by the scaling exponents @xmath432 and @xmath433 . adding a harmonic oscillator potential to the action one achieves @xmath202 .",
    "the weak decay @xmath434 of the propagator leads to divergences in @xmath435 of arbitrarily high degree .",
    "the appearance of unbounded degrees of divergences in field theories on noncommutative @xmath18 is often related to the so - called uv / ir - mixing @xcite .",
    "we learn from the power - counting theorem ( theorem  [ thm1 ] ) that similar effects will show up in any matrix model in which the propagator decays too slowly with @xmath9 .",
