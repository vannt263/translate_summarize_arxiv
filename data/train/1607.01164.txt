    "the invention of _ domain theory _ by dana scott in around the late 1960s was originally intended to give a denotational semantics for the @xmath0-calculus  @xcite .",
    "domain theory is a theory of approximation as it formalizes the notion of partial or incomplete information to represent computations that have not yet returned a result , and thus provides the mathematical foundation to explicate the phenomenon of approximation in computation .",
    "another important but entirely independent theory of approximation that has far - reaching impact , particularly , in knowledge representation and reasoning as well as in data analysis is that of _ rough set theory_. introduced by zdisaw pawlak in  @xcite as a mathematical tool for imperfect data analysis , rough set theory saw many applications in decision support occurring in various disciplines such as computer science , engineering , medicine , education and others .",
    "earlier works due to guo - qiang zhang ( @xcite ) already identified that domain theory , in the form of scott information systems and formal concept analysis , has something to do with rough set theory because of its applications in knowledge representation and reasoning .",
    "but it was yi yu yao ( @xcite ) who first explicitly pointed out the role that domain theory plays in rough set theory relying on the notion of object - oriented concept .",
    "following up on yao s work , lei and luo gave a rough concept representation of complete lattices and showed that rough approximable concepts represent algebraic lattices via two key representation theorems ( theorems 3.2 and 4.6,@xcite ) .",
    "while the aforementioned works demonstrate _ in one direction _ that domain theory manifests in rough set theory via formal concept analysis , it has never been shown _ in the other direction _ what rle rough set theory plays in domain theory .",
    "it is for this very reason that we write this paper  we demonstrate how concepts and well - known results in domain theory can formulated and obtained via our rough set theoretic approach . readers who are well - acquainted with rough set theory know very well that in pawlak s original formulation , the lower and upper approximation operators induced by an equivalence relation @xmath1 on a universe @xmath2 of finite objects play a fundamental rle .",
    "however , in domain theory , the way - below relation @xmath3 on a poset ( which is of central importance ) is far from being reflexive , let alone an equivalence relation . for us ,",
    "the most critical step in the adopting a rough set theoretic approach to domain theory is to get around this problem by defining a new set of approximation operators that is best suited for irreflexive binary relations on posets .",
    "we first gather all the domain - theoretic preliminaries needed for our present development in section  [ sec : prelim ] , and then study how the core concepts in domain theory can be formulated using rough set theory in section  [ sec : domains via rough ] .",
    "this study is carried out over two subsections : ( 1 ) we begin by defining the new approximation operators induced by an auxiliary relation on a poset in subsection  [ subsec : approx operators on aux rel ] . amongst the several order - theoretic properties that we prove concerning these operators ,",
    "the highlight is a certain characterization of the interpolation property enjoyed by a given auxiliary relation in terms of the lower ( respectively , upper ) approximation operators .",
    "( 2 ) we proceed to establish more domain - theoretic results in subsection  [ subsec : approx operators on approx rel ] by requiring further that the auxiliary relation is ( pre-)approximating . to this achieve this , we introduce a new order - compatible topology induced by an ( pre-)approximating relation . in the case of a continuous poset",
    ", we established that the topology induced by the way - below relation is _ exactly _ the scott topology .",
    "this newly introduced topology is studied in greater detail in section  [ sec : further properties ] .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize continuous posets to be precisely those for which the upper approximation operator induced by the way - below relation coincides with the scott closure operator . based on this new characterization of continuity",
    ", we obtain a novel characterization of scott closed sets of a continuous poset  a matter which we continue to pursue further later in section  [ sec : scott closure ] .",
    "this further investigation reveals some link with an earlier ( unpublished ) result by dongsheng zhao  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] by pointing the reader to possible future directions and posing some open questions .",

    "what order - theoretic properties does a poset having one - step closure enjoy ? to answer this question , we need to recall the notion of meet - continuity of posets which was first introduced by  @xcite .",

    "theorems  [ thm : one - step closure implies meet - continuity ] and  [ thm : one - step closure implies scott int is way - above ] give us a more fine - grained means to explain the phenomena that continuous posets are always meet - continuous and possess one - step closure .",
    "at the point of writing , we are not able to completely characterize those poset having a one - step closure .",
    "in this paper , we are guided by rough set theoretic considerations to develop the core of domain theory using suitably defined rough set approximation operators .    in domain theory , the role played by auxiliary relations is indeed quite auxiliary  once the continuity of a dcpo , @xmath223 , is characterized by the condition that the way - below relation @xmath3 is the smallest approximating auxiliary relation on @xmath223 , the auxiliary relations are almost never mentioned in the subsequent development of domain theory .",
    "for instance , auxiliary relations are involved in the study of the scott topology ( which is of central importance in domain theory ) .",
