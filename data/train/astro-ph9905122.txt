    "the origin of the non  thermal , diffuse emission ( radio , x - ray and uv ) in galaxy clusters still remains poorly understood .",
    "the general consensus is that the radio and x - ray non  thermal emission are likely to be produced by a population of relativistic electrons via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering ( hereafter ics ) off the microwave background photons , respectively .",
    "however , the origin , acceleration and propagation of these relativistic electrons are still subject to debate . if electrons are accelerated in discrete sources in the central regions of clusters , the severe energy losses and the diffusive motion force the electrons to cover at most distances of order of a few kpc from the source , while diffuse radio emission is clearly observed on mpc scales @xcite . to solve this problem ,",
    "reacceleration models have been invoked ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , though the nature of the _ in situ _ acceleration is not yet completely clear .    a natural solution to the problem mentioned above",
    "was first proposed in @xcite and @xcite , where the electrons responsible for the non - thermal emission were produced _ in situ _ as secondary products of cosmic ray nucleons interacting with the protons in the intracluster medium ( hereafter icm ) .",
    "cosmic rays ( hereafter cr ) in clusters of galaxies are , in fact , practically free from energy losses and can reach large distances from the source . an interesting consequence of this model is that not only electrons but also gamma rays ( through the decay of neutral pions ) and neutrinos are also produced in the same interactions @xcite . we show here that this point can strongly constrain the validity of the secondary electron model ( hereafter sem ) as the explanation of the diffuse , non - thermal emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "the sem in his original version @xcite was recently questioned @xcite as the explanation of the diffuse radio halo of coma , because of the too steep cr spectrum [ @xmath2 required to fit the data .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the flux and the spectra of the non - thermal radio , uv and hard x - ray emission from coma in the framework of the sem , addressing the following points , not considered in previous works :    _ i _ ) the calculations in @xcite are all carried out in the assumption that cr are permanently confined in the cluster volume . indeed , as shown in @xcite and @xcite this is true only for cr with energy below a _ confinement energy _ @xmath3 ( see section 2 below ) , which depends quite strongly on the diffusion coefficient in the icm ;    _ ii _ ) in previous calculations @xcite , a spatially homogeneous equilibrium distribution of cr was always assumed .",
    "however , if cr are mainly contributed by a small number of discrete powerful sources in the cluster core ( as it seems to be the case in coma ) , the distribution of cr due to diffusion is strongly inhomogeneous ( for instance in the case of a single source the cr distribution goes as @xmath4 if @xmath5 is the distance to the source ) .",
    "similar conclusions hold in case of shocks produced by ( sub)cluster merging or during the cluster collapse , as sources of cr in the clusters .",
    "we consider here both the cases of a single source and of a spatially homogeneous injection of cr in the icm ;    _ iii _ ) the observable fluxes of non - thermal radiation are calculated as a convolution of the distribution of cr and of the targets for cr interactions , which are provided by the ic gas protons .",
    "therefore the spatial distribution of the ic gas , never considered in previous calculations , can have a relevant role and needs to be considered ;    _ iv _ ) in the previous works @xcite a quite steep spectrum , @xmath6 , for the coma radio halo was considered for the comparison with the model predictions .",
    "this was the main reason to call for a correspondingly steep cr spectrum and eventually claim to rule out the sem @xcite .",
    "however recent observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) show that the radio spectrum from coma is well fitted by a power law with power index @xmath7 up to a frequency @xmath8 ghz , while there is a still controversial evidence for a steepening at higher frequencies ( see @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "_ v _ ) we use here a detailed treatment for the @xmath9 collisions , which is particularly important in the calculation of the fluxes of gamma and uv radiation from clusters of galaxies .",
    "in addition to the points listed above , there are some recent data that introduce new limits on the sem . in particular",
    ", the combination of the egret limit on the gamma ray emission from coma @xcite and the recent detection of an hard x - ray non - thermal tail above @xmath10 kev from coma , obtained by the sax @xcite and the rxte @xcite experiments , allows us to strongly constrain the validity of the sem as a combined explanation of both the radio halo emission and the hard x - ray excess .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the still debated evidence of a diffuse uv emission from coma @xcite as a possible indication of ics emission from very low energy electrons .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section 2 we discuss the cr propagation in clusters of galaxies ; in section 3 we derive the secondary electron spectrum from cr collisions in the icm .",
    "we present our calculations for the non - thermal , diffuse radio and x - ray emission in section 4.1 and 4.2 , respectively . in section [ gamma ]",
    "we also derive the expected gamma - ray flux produced by the same cr interactions responsible for the secondary electrons . in section [ coma ]",
    "the calculations are applied and discussed in the case of coma .",
    "our conclusions are presented in the final section [ discussion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we use an dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "following @xcite , we first assume that the accelerated crs in clusters are mainly supplied by radio galaxies  or more generally by active galaxies  and/or by the possible shocks occurring predominantly in the central regions of galaxy clusters . as estimated in @xcite we can expect nearly one of these active galaxies per rich cluster , on average , and also we can expect that there is at least one major shock after its formation @xcite in the central regions of the clusters . actually , this seems to be the situation in the coma cluster ( see @xcite ) . for simplicity , we consider here a cr source in the central region of the cluster irrespective of its peculiar nature .",
    "we will also discuss the more general case of an extended distribution of cluster cr sources in a forthcoming paper @xcite . in the end of this section we consider the case of a spatially homogeneous injection of cr as an extreme case opposite to that of a single source .    in the typical magnetic fields present in clusters of galaxies ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) ,",
    "the propagation of cr is diffusive and can be described by the transport equation : @xmath13 = q(e_p)\\delta ( \\vec { r } ) , \\label{eq : transport}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the density of crs with energy @xmath15 at distance @xmath5 from the source , @xmath16 [ with @xmath17 being the proton momentum ] is the assumed spectrum of the cr source and @xmath18 is the rate of energy losses .",
    "the normalization constant , @xmath19 , is related to the cr luminosity , @xmath20 , by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kinetic energy of the proton .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath23 , has been explicitely assumed to be independent of @xmath5 because we consider an average magnetic field uniformly distributed in the icm . as for the diffusion coefficient",
    ", we adopted the same approach as in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume that the spectrum of the fluctuations in the ic magnetic field is described by a kolmogorov spectrum , @xmath24 , and we use the following expression to relate the diffusion coefficient @xmath23 to @xmath25 : @xmath26 @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the larmor radius of the particles with energy @xmath15 and @xmath29 is the rms magnetic field strength ( @xmath30 is its value expressed in @xmath31 ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath32 is obtained requiring that the total energy density in the field equals @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the size of the largest eddy in the magnetic field .    in clusters of galaxies",
    "( [ eq : transport ] ) simplifies appreciably because the term of energy losses can be neglected .",
    "in fact , for a typical rich cluster with ic gas mass , @xmath35 , and total mass , @xmath36 , over a distance comparable with the abell radius @xmath37 mpc , the average ic gas density turns out to be @xmath38 , which corresponds to a column density of @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 is the cross section for @xmath9 collisions and @xmath41 is the proton mass ) .",
    "this estimate is found assuming cr confined in the cluster for times comparable with the cluster age . for non confined cr ,",
    "the ic gas column density is even lower .    in this framework ,",
    "the solution of eq.([eq : transport ] ) found at the present time , @xmath42 , after the source started to produce cr is given by : @xmath43 where the source term has been assumed active for all the age , @xmath44 of the cluster ( which is comparable , for our purposes , to the age , @xmath42 , of the universe ) .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath45 which represents the average maximum distance that a particle with energy @xmath15 can diffuse away from the source in the time @xmath42 . if @xmath46 , then the lower limit in the integral in eq.([eq : sol ] ) above is small and eq.([eq : sol ] ) gives the well known stationary solution : @xmath47 at distances larger than @xmath48 the density of particles with energy @xmath49 is suppressed .",
    "if @xmath50 is the confinement size of a cluster ( here we consider @xmath51 the radio halo size ) , then the solution of the equation @xmath52 gives an estimate of the maximum energy , @xmath53 , for which crs are confined inside the cluster .",
    "thus , particles with energy lower than @xmath3 need times larger than @xmath42 to leave the cluster , and particles with energy larger than @xmath3 diffuse away from the cluster in the time @xmath54 .",
    "in other words , clusters of galaxies can be considered as _ closed boxes _ only for crs",
    "having energy @xmath55 @xcite .    finally , we discuss here also the extreme case of a homogeneous injection of cr in the icm . in this case",
    "the equilibrium cr distribution is simply given by @xmath56 where again the constant @xmath57 is obtained requiring that @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the total energy injected in the cluster volume @xmath60 in the form of cr .",
    "this neglects the leaking of cr from the boundary of the cluster , which is equivalent to assume that the relevant cr are confined in the cluster .",
    "this assumption is justified , because even if cr with high energy do escape , they do not appreciably affect the energy balance in the cluster for injection spectra steeper than @xmath61 at high energy .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol_homo ] ) is no longer valid close to the cluster boundary .",

    "the interpretation of this result is straightforward : in fact , contrary to the diffuse radio flux , the x - ray flux is very weakly dependent on the value of the magnetic field [ see eq.(13 ) ] .",
    "specifically , it depends on @xmath30 mainly through the normalization of the cr spectrum that is required to fit the radio halo data .",

    "recently , also uv emission was detected from coma @xcite , and interpreted as ics of electrons with energy between @xmath164 mev and @xmath165 mev @xcite . in the sem the flux of uv emission due to ics crucially depends on the cr injection spectrum below @xmath166 gev , which is poorly known and may reflect specific conditions in the acceleration region .",

    "the contribution of secondary electron bremsstrahlung to the gamma ray emission of coma is always negligible with respect to the contribution of gamma rays produced by neutral pion decay ( we report the ratio of the two contributions in the last column of table 1 ) .    our predictions for the differential gamma ray spectra from coma",

    "how much does this conclusion depend upon the assumption of a single source of cr ? in order to answer this question we evaluate the fluxes of radio and hard x - rays for a homogeneous injection of cr over the cluster volume . if the observed radio halo spectrum at @xmath172 ghz is taken as a power law with power index @xmath173 @xcite , then the best fit to the data is obtained for @xmath174 .",

    "we can envision two possible avenues : from the point of view of data analysis , it was already pointed out in @xcite that the rebinning of the hard x - ray data according with the osse energy binning yields an hard x - ray flux which is a factor @xmath180 below the osse upper limit at @xmath181 kev .",
    "this allows the magnetic field to increase to values @xmath182 and the corresponding gamma ray fluxes to decrease slightly below the egret limit for @xmath183 , or slightly above it for @xmath149 .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the ics origin of the hard x - ray excess observed in coma can not be taken for granted as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the previous authors propose , in fact , that the turbulence in the icm may be able to accelerate stochastically a fraction of thermal electrons producing a non - thermal tail of the electron distribution without appreciably change the energy budget of the electrons in the ic gas .",
    "such non - thermal tail can easily reproduce the sax data through bremmstrahlung emission .",
    "the main consequence of this is that the hard x - ray flux becomes completely decoupled from the radio halo flux and no constraint on the strength of the ic magnetic field can be derived .",
    "therefore , the large @xmath162 field solutions illustrated in figs .",
    "1b and 1c may well fit the radio spectrum and contribute only very marginally to the hard x - ray spectrum . in this case the gamma ray flux for coma predicted by the sem is well below the egret limit .",
    "as for the uv flux , the small discrepancy we found might be due to the specific choice of the cr spectrum at low energy . in any case ,",
    "the origin of the uv excess is still under debate , and a thermal contribution can not be excluded ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we did not discuss here the additional issue concerning the nature of the claimed steepening in the radio halo spectrum at frequencies @xmath184 ghz . whether this is a real feature or",
    "an instrumental artifact is not yet clear ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , if future measurements will confirm this result , the sem will again have problems since the electron ageing , often invoked to describe the steepening of the spectrum , is not effective in the sem because secondary electrons are continuously produced through cr interactions and replenish the radio halo spectrum , even if the cr source is no longer active . on the other hand ,",
    "the sem predicts a steepening of the radio spectrum at high frequency , where cr begin to be not confined by the ic magnetic field ( see section [ radio ] for details ) , but at present such a steepening does not seem sufficient to reproduce the data at @xmath185 ghz , assuming that these results are not due to any instrumental bias .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the spectra of the non - thermal radio , x - ray , uv and gamma ray emission expected from clusters of galaxies in the context of the secondary electron model , and we compared our predictions to the available data for the coma cluster .",
    "the calculations have been carried out in the case of a single source of cr and in the case of a homogeneous injection of cr in the icm .    for the case of a single cr source and adopting a kolmogorov spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations in the icm , the radio data between @xmath186 mhz and @xmath8 ghz can be fitted in the context of the sem for a wide range of values of the parameters ( specifically the value of the magnetic field and the spectrum of the injected cr ) . in particular , for magnetic fields of the order of @xmath187 the cr luminosities needed to fit the radio data are completely consistent with the presence of ordinary sources of cr in clusters , as considered in @xcite ( @xmath188 erg / s ) .",
    "moreover the model has the noticeable property that electrons are produced _ in situ _ at any time , so that there is no need for a reacceleration mechanism which is necessary in the primary electron model in order to make it possible for electrons to reach distances of @xmath166 mpc ( the scale of the coma radio halo ) withouth appreciable energy losses .",
    "together with the diffuse radio emission , non - thermal x - rays ( due to ics of secondary electrons ) and gamma rays ( mainly due to neutral pion decay and to bremsstrahlung of secondary electrons ) are produced .",
    "the comparison of our predictions with the available x - ray and gamma ray data allows us to put strong constraints on the sem as a plausible explanation for the origin of the radio halos in coma - like clusters .",
    "in fact , if the x - ray emission is due to ics of the same electron population which is responsable for the diffuse radio emission , then low values of the magnetic field ( @xmath167 ) and correspondingly large cr luminosities ( @xmath159 erg / s ) are required , which in turn imply a flux of gamma rays at @xmath189 mev exceeding the egret limit by a factor @xmath180 for a power index of the injection spectrum of cr @xmath148 , and by a factor @xmath190 for @xmath149 .",
    "this result requires some more comments : assuming a cluster temperature of @xmath191 kev , and a typical ic gas density in the inner @xmath166 mpc of the cluster of @xmath192 , the total thermal energy in the cluster can be estimated to be @xmath193 erg .",
    "now , if we follow @xcite in requiring equipartition between thermal and non- thermal energy in the icm , this translates into a cr luminosity , averaged over the age of the cluster , of @xmath194 erg / s , which is of the same order of the cr luminosities required in the sem to reproduce the radio and hard x - ray emission from coma .",
    "however , as we have shown in section 5 , in this case the corresponding gamma ray luminosities contributed by pion decay can very easily exceed the egret limit or fall short of this limit by a very small amount this conclusion is not changed if a homogeneous injection of cr in the icm is assumed , as discussed in section [ coma ] .    though this is not enough to rule out the possibility of cr in equipartition in clusters like coma",
    ", it certainly represents a strong constraint on this possibility .",
    "the next generation gamma ray satellites ( integral , glast ) will answer this question definitely .",
    "in fact , future gamma ray observations will tell us not only the flux of gamma rays but also the nature of the process responsible for that : specifically , if the bulk of gamma rays comes from pion decay in the icm , there is a unique signature , represented by a bump in the gamma ray spectrum at @xmath195 mev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    is there an alternative way of interpreting the combined radio and hard x - ray data that does not require equipartition cr energy densities ?",
    "it was recently proposed in @xcite that the hard x - ray flux from coma can as well be interpreted as bremmstrahlung emission from a supra - thermal electron tail developed in the thermal electron distribution due to stochastic acceleration in the turbulent icm . clearly",
    ", these last electrons are not relevant for the radio halo emission , so that a non - thermal population of electrons in the @xmath196 energy range is required .",
    "if this will turn out to be the explanation of the hard x - ray excess of coma , then the observed radio and non - thermal x - ray fluxes are no longer strictly related . as a consequence , the radio halo emission can be produced by a population of secondary electrons radiating in a @xmath197 average magnetic field , without overproducing gamma rays ( see table 1 ) and giving a marginal contribution to the non - thermal x - ray flux by ics .    in any case",
    ", it is important to realize that the gamma ray limit , widely discussed in this paper , appears to be relevant whatever the process of production of the radiating electrons is .",
    "therefore , the egret upper limit must be considered as binding in the sem , as well as in other models for the non - thermal processes in clusters of galaxies , whenever large cr energy densities are invoked .",
    "this aspect was also recognized in @xcite but the importance of the gamma rays from pion decay was largely underestimated .",
    "finally , we want to discuss briefly the problem of the rarity of the radio halos in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this problem needs a definitive explanation in every model for the origin of radio halos . at present , only half a dozen clusters have been shown to have prominent radio halos ( see @xcite for a review ) and it is natural to look for the reason for such a rarity .",
    "most of the radio halo clusters have high temperatures ( @xmath198 kev ) and x - ray luminosities @xmath199 erg / s and show evidences of recent merging ( coma @xcite , a2319 @xcite , a2163 @xcite , a2218 ) and/or of non  thermal pressure support of their ic medium ( a85 @xcite )    there are a number of factors that can play a relevant role : first of all , the cr injection in the icm depends on the morphology of the cluster ( e.g. on the number of active galaxies in a cluster ) and on the hystory of the cluster ( e.g. on the occurrence of recent mergings ) .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that only a few clusters have powerful cr sources operating for long enough in the icm to provide high powers in accelerated particles .",
    "secondly , the different physical conditions present in the icm determine quite a variety of values for the magnetic field and for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in fact , we have shown in this paper that , at fixed @xmath20 , changing the average ic magnetic field from @xmath200 to @xmath201 decreases the radio halo flux by a factor @xmath202 , so that very weak radio halos can fall below the sensitivity threshold of the current experiments .",
    "the origin of radio halos is , in our opinion , strictly related to the mechanism of production of the high energy electrons and to the physical mechanisms which create the environment in which they radiate , and can hardly be envisioned at the present stage of observations .",
    "the combination of the next generation , high - sensitivity radio , soft and hard gamma ray experiments will provide a zoo of non  thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters and will hopefully shed a new light on this problem .",
