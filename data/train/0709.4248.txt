    "in the era of large spectroscopic surveys such as sdss  @xcite , the  @xmath02796/2803 doublet seen in background qso spectra is particularly useful for selecting thousands of absorbing galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "galaxies selected via their  @xmath02796/2803 doublet have been used as proxies for studying  selected galaxies at @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is not clear whether this cold gas is part of the interstellar medium of large spirals @xcite , part of the halos of galaxies @xcite or part of dwarf galaxies @xcite akin to the magellanic clouds .",
    "an alternative scenario for absorption - selected galaxies is that the gas seen in absorption is part of cold gas clumps in the host galaxy halos entrained in outflows produced by supernovae ( sne ) @xcite .",
    "most likely all three scenarios play a role , but in what proportion for a given equivalent width or  column density ?    using cross - correlation techniques , @xcite statistically constrained the halo mass of @xmath112000  host galaxies , finding that the host halo mass ( @xmath15 ) decreases with increasing  rest - equivalent width ( ) . given that the equivalent width must be correlated with the line - of - sight velocity width , @xmath16 , as also verified observationally by @xcite , these results imply that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are anti - correlated .",
    "this seems to show that the clouds responsible for the absorption are not virialized , otherwise , a @xmath15@xmath16 correlation would have been measured .",
    "a natural explanation for this is that the cold gas originates from sn - driven outflows , in which case the velocity width @xmath16 may be related to the outflow kinematics or may be a measure of the mass outflow rate . in a few cases , evidence for super - winds",
    "is seen from the absorption profile @xcite .",
    "others , e.g. @xcite and @xcite arrived at the same conclusion that super - winds play a significant role in  absorbers from very different perspectives .",
    "the most important implication from the starburst scenario is that the selection of galaxies via the  absorption signature may be equivalent to selecting starburst - producing super - winds .",
    "equivalently , non - detections of the  signature of a starburst would enable one to rule out the starburst scenario , while the presence of  emission is no un - ambiguous proof of starburst - driven winds .    in this letter",
    ", we report the first results of our `` sinfoni  program for line emitters '' ( simple ) , which is aimed at detecting  from the starburst galaxy using the integral field unit ( ifu ) sinfoni @xcite available at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the advantages of ifus include the possibility of detecting the  host at impact parameters smaller than the seeing disk , and of measuring the two - dimensional kinematics of galaxies .",
    "we present our sample selection in section  2 , and results in section  3 . throughout",
    ", we use the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 cosmology .",
    "our sample of -selected galaxies is selected from the sdss/2qz databases and from the compilation of @xcite with the only physical criterion @xmath2   .",
    "we then ensured that the corresponding  emission line would fall inside the sinfoni wavelength range and away from sky oh emission lines .",
    "the @xmath2    criterion was used for the following two reasons .",
    "first , in the super - wind scenario , the strongest absorbers ( as measured by ) ought to have the largest star - formation rates , hence the largest  fluxes .",
    "second , the @xmath2    criterion is known to select the hosts with the smallest impact parameters , @xmath20  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath21 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath22 , which means that the host galaxy will fall within the field of view of sinfoni ( 8) .",
    "we have obtained sinfoni observations towards 21  absorbing galaxies all with absorption redshift @xmath23 , i.e. corresponding the @xmath24-band filter .",
    "we focused on @xmath1 systems because ( 1 ) this redshift range is close to the range used in @xcite , and ( 2 ) our flux sensitivity is enhanced in the j - band compared to that in the k - band .",
    "the latter point is due to the gain in luminosity distance compared to the loss in raw instrument throughput .",
    "for each qso field we took 4@xmath25600s exposures , placing the qso in the four quadrants of the field of view . the total exposure time for the host galaxy",
    "thus varies between 10 and 40 minutes , depending on its location with respect to the qso .",
    "the observations were all taken in seeing - limited mode with @xmath26  pixels , in moderate ( optical ) seeing conditions ( 11.5 ) , yielding a point spread function ( psf ) of 0.81.2  in the j - band .",
    "the data reduction is based on pairwise subtraction of the frames as in @xcite using the mpe sinfoni pipeline ( spred , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and the oh sky line removal scheme of @xcite .",
    "the wavelength solution is obtained using the ar lamp frames , and the absolute wavelength is obtained directly from the oh sky emission lines .",
    "flux calibration is performed using telluric standard stars .",
    "from the sinfoni data - cubes , we detect an  emitter within @xmath27  km  s@xmath4  of the predicted location from the  redshift in 14  of the 21  fields down to a flux limit of 4@xmath28  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10  ( 1-@xmath8 ) ( see table  1 ) . in other words",
    ", we have a 67%  detection rate .",
    "the undetected hosts are either fainter than our flux limit or outside the field of view . fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] shows the  flux maps for all of the detected host galaxies . in all frames ,",
    "the qso psf ( typically 0.8 - 1.2  fwhm ) was subtracted from the  flux maps and is shown as contours .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , the impact parameters range from 0.2  to 4  ( 1 to 25  kpc ) with one at @xmath29 \" ( j0841 + 2339 ) . the very strong absorber ( = 4.5 ) towards the qso 2qzj0226 - 28 is detected with an impact parameter of 0.2 , well within the seeing disk .",
    "we can rule out the possibility of this emission line being from the qso .",
    "indeed , the emission line at 1.327@xmath30 m corresponds to 4185in the rest - frame of the qso and therefore does not correspond to any known atomic transition .",
    "furthermore , the emission line is clearly spatially offset from the qso centroid .",
    "this shows that it is possible to decouple the intervening galaxy and the qso owing to the information contained in the ifu data cube .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that all the 14  emission lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] be something else in relation to other intervening systems along the line of sight .",
    "for the strongest emitters ( j0448,j0302,j0822,j0943 ) , we do also detect [ nii ] @xmath06583 and [ sii ] @xmath316717,6731 , therefore lifting any ambiquity .",
    "in the cases where only one line is detected , we can reject the other possibilities ( , , ) for the following reasons .",
    "[ ] @xmath05007 is a doublet easily identifiable at the sinfoni resolution @xmath32 . [ ] @xmath03727 would not be resolved , but that would put the galaxy at a redshift higher than the qso emission redshift . in most cases , the same argument applies for . when not , we have checked the qso spectrum for possible corresponding absorbers ( , ) and found nothing in the qso spectrum at the corresponding location .    after more than two decades , only @xmath33 absorption - selected galaxies have been identified in emission , and mostly at @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) using broad band imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "low - redshift ( @xmath34 )  absorbers have been identified more easily @xcite than low-@xmath35 and high-@xmath35 damped  absorbers ( dlas ) , which are all also  absorbers @xcite .",
    "our 67%   detection rate of the host  emission is thus in contrast to most previous  studies of absorption - selected galaxies since our sample of strong  absorbers ( @xmath2   ) is dominated by dla ` candidates ' meeting the criterion of @xcite ( see table  1 ) and is due to several factors . if our careful avoidance of oh sky emission lines plays a significant role , it is the sinfoni throughput that enabled us to reach flux limits unavailable previously from the ground , reaching @xmath36  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10  or a sfr of @xmath110.5  at @xmath37 in less than 1  hr . for comparison ,",
    "previous  surveys for @xmath38 dlas include the ground - based surveys of ( e.g. ) @xcite unveiling several candidates down to @xmath39erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10(@xmath40 ) , @xcite unveiling several candidates down to @xmath41erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10(@xmath40 ) , @xcite showing no detection down to @xmath42@xmath43erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10(@xmath40 ) , the _ hst_/nicmos survey of the @xmath44 dla ( = 1.5   ) by @xcite showing no detections down to @xmath45erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10(@xmath40 ) , and the nicmos survey of a @xmath46 dla by @xcite showing no detection down to @xmath47erg  s@xmath4  @xmath10(3@xmath8 ) .",
    "the large number of  detections in this survey shows the relatively high star formation rates of the host galaxy given our shallow exposures .",
    "the averaged integrated  luminosity for our sample is @xmath48  erg  s@xmath4 ( median @xmath49  erg  s@xmath4 ) , uncorrected for extinction .",
    "this is about @xmath7  times that of the starburst m82 whose raw @xmath50 is @xmath51  erg  s@xmath4 @xcite . if we adopt a statistical correction of @xmath52mag as derived for local star - forming and starburst galaxies of similar  luminosities @xcite , we infer an average ( median ) sfr of @xmath1112  ( 7 )  using the @xcite flux conversion for a salpeter imf , and @xmath117  ( 4 )  using the @xcite imf ( both from 0.1  to 100  ) .",
    "table  [ table : summary ] lists the derived properties of our sample .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] shows the sfr as a function of .",
    "it appears that there is a correlation between the sfr and , which is significant at more than @xmath53-@xmath8 : the pearson correlation coefficient is @xmath54 with a @xmath55-value@xmath56 , and a spearman rank test gives @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the corrrelation is very consistent with the analysis of @xcite who found that the hosts of the strongest  absorbers are bluer .",
    "if stronger starbursts produce larger outflows ( whose signature is more clouds over a larger @xmath16 ) , such a correlation would naturally arise in the outflow scenario .",
    "we will attempt to model this in more detail in bouch et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the inferred sfrs are moderate , but whether or not the  emitters seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] are producing winds depends on the sfr per unit area , @xmath59 , not on the integrated sfr .",
    "for instance , the starbursts m82 ( sfr@xmath60 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc 1569 ( sfr@xmath61 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have @xmath59 greater than the 0.1  kpc@xmath62 threshold for harboring sn driven outflows @xcite , and do show strong outflows .",
    "already , the majority of our sample meet this criteria .",
    "higher spatial resolution data and better size constraints will enable us to test whether strong  selected galaxies always meet the outflow threshold and , in the cases where it does , to probe the outflow physical properties .",
    "as stated in section  1 ,  ought to be present and detected in the starburst ",
    "outflow scenario .",
    "had we not detected , this would have ruled out the outflow scenario .",
    "the high detection fraction thus prevents us from ruling out the outflow scenario .",
    "the relatively high average sfr ( compared to m82 ) is in fact very consistent with the prediction of the starburst ",
    "outflow scenario , and we view this result as supporting the outflow scenario , but other interpretations are possible . note that our conclusion _ only _ applies for galaxies selected with the strongest  absorption equivalent widths ( @xmath63   ) .",
    "absorption systems with @xmath64    are much more numerous and may select a more diverse class of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows an example of the two dimensional velocity field for one of the  host galaxies .",
    "for the remainder of the sample , when we can extract the velocity field , we find that the host galaxy of  absorbers with @xmath65  reside in halos with masses ranging from @xmath6611.9 with a logarithmic mean @xmath13 , once corrected for inclination . this is 10 times smaller than the milky way , and in good agreement with the halo masses predicted from the clustering analysis of @xcite and @xcite . here we are using the maximum velocity @xmath67 as a proxy for the circular velocity . in n. bouch",
