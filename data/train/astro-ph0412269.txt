    "recent observations @xcite indicate that @xmath4 70% of the present - day energy density of the universe may be made of a dark energy component .",
    "the two leading explanations of dark energy are a cosmological constant or a slowly rolling scalar field e.g.,@xcite but an explanation in terms of modifications to the friedman equations(e.g.@xcite is also possible . in both cases",
    "this component has a negative pressure thus inducing an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "a significant observational effort is directed to unveil the nature of dark energy ( e.g. , , , , , , ) . with few exceptions @xcite , current constraints on the nature of dark energy mostly measure the integrated value over time of its equation of state parameter ( @xmath5 ) ( e.g.,@xcite ) or , alternatively its energy density as a function of time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which depends on the integral of the equation of state parameter .",
    "these constraints are very tight ( e.g. @xcite finds @xmath6 ) and are centered around the expected value for the cosmological constant , but , as pointed out by @xcite , the finding that the time average value of @xmath7 is consistent with @xmath8 does not exclude the possibility that @xmath7 varied in time .",
    "therefore , it is an open challenge to determine whether dark energy is a cosmological constant or a rolling of a scalar field .",
    "a recent review of the current status of our knowledge of the observational determination of @xmath7 and possible theoretical models to explain it is given by @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , it is not only important to clarify whether this energy component is dynamical or constant , but , in case it is not a cosmological constant , it is also of great interest to constrain the potential of the rolling scalar field . since different theoretical models are typically characterised by different potentials , a reconstruction of the dark energy potential from observations can yield more direct constraints on physically motivated dark energy models .    in this paper",
    "we present a non - parametric method to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the potential and kinetic energy densities of the dark energy field .",
    "our formalism introduces quantities similar to the horizon - flow parameters @xcite in inflation .",
    "it has the nice feature that it is easily implemented in the presence of higher order curvature corrections to general relativity and different types of energy contributions in einstein s equations , as we do in section [ sec : dyn ] .",
    "our exact reconstruction formulas determine the value of the potential at a given redshift once the matter density , hubble parameter @xmath9 and its first derivative @xmath10 are experimentally measured at that redshift value .",
    "we discuss the observational challenges to reconstruct the potential in this fully non - parametric way due to the difficulty in measuring @xmath11 . as current data",
    "is not good enough to determine @xmath11 , we present a general parameterization of the potential , based on an expansion in chebyshev polynomials . in this approach , the scalar potential function at a given redshift is expanded in chebyshev polynomials , which constitutes a complete orthonormal basis on a finite interval , and have the nice property to be the _ minimax _ approximating polynomial .",
    "our reconstruction equation becomes a differential equation for the hubble parameter , which we solve analytically , and the coefficients in the chebyshev expansion become the parameters to be constrained from observations of the hubble parameter .",
    "our general parameterization can apply to other approaches that were already considered in the literature , such as expansions of the equation of state and we show the correspondence to some parameterizations that have been proposed in the literature . using current data ( in particular with recent supernovae data and relative ages of a sample of passively evolving galaxies ) we reconstruct the potential of dark energy using our parameterization up to @xmath12 .",
    "the reconstructed potentials obtained from galaxy ages and sn are consistent .",
    "since these two data sets rely on independent physics and are affected by completely different systematics , this finding suggests that possible systematics are not a crucial issue .",
    "the reconstructed potential is consistent with being constant up to the maximum redshift of the observations , although current constraints do not exclude a variation as a function of redshift .",
    "we show that data obtained with the atacama cosmology telescope will be able to greatly improve current constraints .",
    "the classical effective action that we shall use to describe the dynamics of the universe is @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the four dimensional planck mass and @xmath15 for the components of the four dimensional metric , @xmath16 which we shall consider to be an homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat frw cosmology , as supported by recent data @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 stands for the classical action describing the physical energy content , such as matter and radiation , but it could also include more exotic sources ( e.g. defects , cosmic strings etc . ) . note also that we have implicitly assumed the existence of a single canonically normalised quintessence scalar field @xmath18 subject to the potential @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we have assumed that this potential is independent of the derivatives of the scalar field . for generality , in eq .",
    "we include the effect of higher derivative terms in the gravitational sector of the theory @xcite .",
    "these are described by the function @xmath20 of the different invariants that we can construct out of the metric and its derivatives . in four dimensions , the most general lowest order corrections to einstein s classical action",
    "would be described by @xmath21 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "other corrections that have been considered , include arbitrary functions of the scalar curvature @xmath22 @xcite , which include as particular examples linear combinations of negative powers of these invariants @xcite .",
    "we focus on cosmologies given by , and shall restrict ourselves to classical configurations @xmath23 , configurations that do not break the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of this scalar field configuration is that of a perfect fluid , with density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the kinetic energy of the field . under these assumptions ,",
    "one is led to consider einstein s equations , plus the klein - gordon equation of motion for the scalar field .",

    "for example @xmath31 denotes the full energy density contribution of @xmath17 and of the higher derivative curvature terms @xmath20 . thus if the sources are a collection of @xmath33 perfect fluids with constant equation of state @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 describe the contribution from the higher derivative curvature terms . for the particular function",
    "@xmath39 introduced above , such terms would be written as @xmath40    on the other hand , the scalar field @xmath41 equation of motion reduces to @xmath42 where @xmath43 .      in this section",
    "we provide exact analytical expressions in which both , the kinetic and potential energies of the quintessence field @xmath41 , depend on quantities more directly observable such as the energy densities , the hubble constant @xmath44 and its derivatives . although the higher curvature corrections are not directly observable , they will also have to appear in the expressions : they can be taken into account for a given model that is for a given parameterization of the functional @xmath45 .",
    "provided one has an independent way of determining the densities , @xmath44 and @xmath11 , the value of the potential @xmath46 at a given redshift @xmath47 where these measurements are available , can then be fixed , up to experimental uncertainties .",
    "if also higher order derivatives of @xmath44 are known , higher derivatives of the potential can be determined @xmath48 , which can be used to probe the flatness of the potential .",

    "there are many similarities between the period of inflation and the present - day accelerated expansion , but , despite the fact that inflation happened 13.7 billion years ago , and the accelerated expansion is happening today , as we will see , it is not observationally easier to reconstruct the dark energy potential than it is to reconstruct the inflationary potential . in the equation describing inflationary dynamics the contribution due to matter can be ignored , but it ca nt be ignored when describing today s expansion .",
    "moreover , the detailed shape of the primordial power spectum from cmb scales to large scale structure scales , and the nature of the primordial perturbations offer a window to test the last 4 inflation efoldings ; conversely , in the case of dark energy , dark energy started dominating at @xmath54 , and between then and now the universe expanded only by a factor @xmath55 .",
    "in addition we can measure with exquisite precision perturbations from inflation but have not detected perturbations from dark energy , which is a very challenging task @xcite . on the other hand we do not have strong constraints on the energy scale of inflation , that is on the `` normalization '' of the inflationary potential @xcite but as we will see , since the matter content of the universe can be independently determined , for a flat universe , we have some constraints on the quintessence potential normalization .    keeping in mind the different kind of challenges that a quintessence potential reconstruction faces",

    "an interesting parameterization of the potential involves the chebyshev polynomials , which form a complete set of orthonormal functions on the interval @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "they also have the interesting property to be the minimax approximating polynomial , that is , the approximating polynomial which has the smallest maximum deviation from the true function at any given order .",

    "it is widespread to parameterize dark energy not by the scalar field potential but by its equation of state . in this section",
    "we connect the two descriptions .",
    "standard contributions to the energy momentum tensor in einstein s equations are characterized by a parameter that governs how their energy densities decrease with the expansion of the universe . for the energy density of the scalar field we can write in all generality @xmath128    the klein - gordon equation",

    "this relation provides an expression for the potential energy density of the scalar field once the equation of state is known , using : @xmath142 the case of a constant @xmath143 , or equivalently , a constant equation of state @xmath144 would correspond to the redshift parameterization considered in with @xmath145 thus , for a physical situation resembling a cosmological constant @xmath146 , the parameter @xmath147 , as we claimed in the previous section .",
    "some constant scalar field energy density scalings were discussed by @xcite .",
    "the above formalism is a natural generalisation of their models .",
    "up to now we have assumed that dark energy is given by a scalar field .",
    "the techniques developed here however can also be used in a more general context .",
    "if the dark energy is not due to a scalar field we can still describe it as a fluid with a given equation of state .",
    "as long as the equation of state @xmath7 is @xmath148 the two descriptions are equivalent .",
    "for example for a given set of parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 and @xmath120 , @xmath151 is known , the kinetic energy can be computed using eq .",
    "[ eq.kinetic_cheby ] , thus @xmath152 is known ( eq . [ eq : obsf(t ) ] ) and so @xmath0 ( eq . [ eq : eqstate ] ) .    however if we want to allow @xmath153 then the scalar field description as presented here fails .",
    "however , analogously to section [ sec.v_cheby ] , we can expand the redshift dependence of @xmath7 in chebyshev polynomials without imposing any restrictions on the values that @xmath7 can take .",

    "we have proposed to constrain the nature of dark energy , a rolling scalar field or a cosmological constant , by reconstructing its potential as a function of redshift .",
    "we have presented a formalism , similar to the horizon - flow parameters in inflation , to relate quantities characterizing the dark energy dynamics , i.e. potential and kinetic energy densities , to direct observables such as the matter density @xmath286 , the hubble parameter @xmath83 and its derivatives .",
    "this is the core of our reconstruction programme , and our results are summarised by , and , which provide the value of the potential and kinetic energy densities , and the first derivative of the potential , as a function of redshift .",
    "these expressions are valid even in the presence of higher order curvature corrections to general relativity and exotic matter sources . in principle",
    ", integrating the exact reconstruction formula for the kinetic energy , allows one to determine the function @xmath70 . using the latter",
    ", one can infer the real shape of the potential @xmath69 $ ] from the determination of @xmath46 .",
    "we have then focused on the case of a expanding universe with only matter and dark energy components and at @xmath287 . in this case",

    "this exact reconstruction formulas are currently difficult to be used due to the experimental challenges in determining the derivatives of the hubble parameter [ sec : exp ] . however , given a parameterisation for the potential energy density",

    "thus determinations of @xmath83 can be used to constrain @xmath46 directly .",
    "since effectively one will always be dealing with observations covering a finite redshift range , by an appropiate linear transformation in the redshift variable , we can always work in the interval @xmath288 $ ] , where we know the set of chebyshev polynomials provide a complete orthonormal set of functions , i.e. any function in the interval can be expressed as a linear combination of chebyshev polynomials . moreover ,",
    "these approximating polynomials have the smallest maximum deviation from the true function at any given order , and provide a well - defined estimate of the error introduced in the truncation of the expansion at a finite order .",
    "we point out , in passing , that such a parameterisation could be used in any other attempts considered in the literature where it was the equation of state the observable being parameterised by its redshift dependence .    using observations of passively evolving galaxies we obtain measurements of the hubble parameter at 9 different redshifts .",
    "we use these determinations to constrain the first three coefficients in the chebyshev expansion of the potential .",
    "for comparison we repeat the analysis using recent supernovae data , which give us an integral of the hubble parameter .",
    "we find that the reconstructed potentials from both data sets are consistent , giving some confidence that the results are not heavily plagued by systematic errors .",
    "the standard lcdm model is consistent with current data at the 1@xmath289 level .",
    "we show that future data obtained from the atacama cosmology telescope will greatly improve the constraints .    since a cosmological constant is a good fit to the observations we asked the question of how to generically describe small deviations from this simple scenario .",
    "it is clear that even if the nature of dark energy might be related to a dynamical field , distinguishing such a scenario from a real cosmological constant will be an extraordinary experimental challenge , as the dark energy potential can be arbitrarily close to a constant .",
    "we thus analysed the conditions for the dark energy field to `` slow - roll '' in the presence of matter , thus enabling a dynamical dark energy to get arbitrarily close to a cosmological constant . by expanding the potential in taylor series for @xmath290 we derived the generalisation of the standard slow - roll conditions used in inflation , in the presence of matter , which translate into conditions that the functional @xmath69 $ ] must satisfy to explain the maximum deviation allowed from a cosmological constant .    even though in this paper we focused on single canonically normalised scalar field , it should be clear that it is straightforward to apply our formalism to an arbitrary number of them , not necessarily being canonically normalised . however , the observables quantities are the matter density , the hubble parameter and its derivatives , which depend on the full kinetic and potential energy densities of the scalar field sector , and are insensitive to whether these values are given by the superposition of more than one field .",
    "this opens up the question of whether one would be able to determine , experimentally , the existence of more than one rolling scalar field .",
    "in other words , to which extent it is possible to disentagle the full kinetic / potential energy of a superposition of scalar fields into the kinetic / potential energies of their components ?",
    "we have illustrated the enormous experimental challenges of reconstructing @xmath69 $ ] from @xmath46 just for a single scalar field .",
    "the task is even harder for more than one field as there are more derivative directions to consider , @xmath291 , and direct experimental observables depend only on the time derivatives of the full potential energy , i.e.@xmath292 .",
    "such a disentanglement seems extremely challenging , if not impossible , at least from the perspective of the formalism developed here . in this context",
    "we can say that our formalism enables one to reconstruct the properties ( potential and kinetic energy ) , of an `` effective '' field .",
