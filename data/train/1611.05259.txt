    "luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are evolved massive stars ( @xmath3 ) , intrinsically bright ( @xmath4 ) and hot ( o , b spectral type ) .",
    "they are unstable and exhibit spectroscopic and photometric variability . during the lbv variability cycle they can resemble a cooler supergiant of spectral type a or f , and",
    "show visual magnitude variations over a wide range of amplitudes and timescales ( as discussed and reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of their instability , they suffer mass - loss at high rate ( @xmath5 ) and form circumstellar nebulae .",
    "the mechanism that causes this instability is still poorly understood . to explain the common `` s doradus type '' outbursts ( with visual magnitude variations of 1 - 2 mag on timescales of years ) , changes of the photospheric physical conditions",
    "have been invoked .",
    "this variation of the photospheric physical conditions is caused by a change of the wind efficiency due to variation of the ionisation of fe , which is the main carrier of line - driven stellar winds .",
    "this mechanism is known as the `` bi - stability jump '' ( explained by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a predicted effect of which is mass - loss variability @xcite .",
    "the observational mass - loss rates estimated from different indicators ( e.g. uv and optical emission lines , radio free - free emission ) have often been discrepant , most of the time depending on whether clumped or unclumped wind models were assumed .",
    "for example , @xcite found that mass - loss rates estimated from lines in clumpy stellar winds of o stars are systematically smaller than those obtained from squared electron density diagnostics ( e.g. h@xmath6 and radio free - free emission ) with unclumped wind models , resulting in empirical mass - loss rates overestimated by a factor 10 or more .",
    "the implication is that line - driven stellar winds are not sufficient to strip off quickly the h envelope , before they evolve to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite .",
    "enhanced mass - loss was therefore proposed to reduce the stellar mass , possibly through short - duration eruptions or explosions .",
    "subsequently , @xcite showed that if macro - clumping ( instead of optically thin , micro - clumping ) is taken into account , lines become significantly weaker and lead to underestimation of the mass - loss rate .",
    "finally , showed that for moderate clumping ( factor up to 10 ) and reasonable mass - loss rate reductions ( of a factor of 3 ) the empirical mass - loss rates agree with the observational rates and , more importantly , with the model - independent transition mass - loss rate , which is independent of any clumping effects .",
    "the implication of this is that eruptive events are not needed to make wr stars .",
    "the mechanism that triggered the `` giant eruptions '' ( with visual magnitude changes larger than 2 mag ) witnessed in the 17th ( p cygni ) and in the 19th century ( @xmath7 carinae ) in our galaxy is still unknown , but some scenarios involving hydrodynamic ( sub - photospheric ) instabilities , rapid rotation and close binarity have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and ref .",

    "given the short duration of the lbv phase ( @xmath8 ) , combined with the rapid evolution of massive stars , lbvs are rare : only a few tens of objects in our galaxy and in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) @xcite satisfy the variability criteria coupled with high mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , based on the discovery of dusty ring nebulae surrounding luminous stars , the number of galactic candidate lbvs ( clbvs ) has increased recently to 55 @xcite . a few tens of confirmed lbvs have been discovered in farther galaxies ( e.g. m31 , m33 , ngc2403 * ? ? ?",

    "the lbv nebulae ( lbvne ) observed in our galaxy usually consist of both gas and dust .",

    "on the other hand , ir observations revealed that the dust is often distributed outside of the ionised region , indicative of mass - loss episodes of different epochs and/or that the nebulae are ionisation - bounded ( e.g. , g79.29@xmath90.46 , g26.47@xmath90.02 , wray 15 - 751 , ag car , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we converted the @xmath24 and @xmath25 pixel units in the maps from arcsec to parsec , assuming a distance of 48.5 kpc .",
    "hence , from visual inspection of the map we adopted the values listed in table  [ tab : priors ] . as priors of both offsets @xmath20and @xmath21  we adopted very narrow gaussians , truncated at @xmath26  pixels from the central pixel .",

    "the distribution of shell radii ( panels 2 in fig .  [",
    "fig : s61_posteriors ] ) is quite broad , but clearly peaks within the shell .",
    "the radial thickness of the gaussian shell is symmetric around the peak in both panels 3 .",
    "a similar comment can be given for the upper clip radius @xmath19 ( panels 5 ) .",
    "the lower clip radius @xmath18 ( panels 4 ) is left - bounded at 0 , and the decline at the large - values tail is driven by our prior requirement .",

    "while the map model for the seems underestimated , the model profile is quite satisfactory .    as evident in the tables , different models ( tns",
    ", pls exp=0 , pls exp=-1 ) produce similar - quality results , meaning that with the current data we can not constrain the electron density distribution in the s61 nebula .      knowing the 3d distribution of the electron number density @xmath36",
    ", we can now compute the total ionised mass contained in the shell via @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39  the proton and solar masses , under the assumption that the gas comprises only ionised hydrogen . for simple symmetric geometries and density distributions",
    "this integral can be evaluated analytically ( e.g. a constant - density shell ) , but it might be significantly more challenging for more complicated geometries and more complex density fields . in our discretised 3d cartesian grid , realizing that the volume of a 3d - voxel is @xmath40 , because @xmath41 , eq .",

    "[ fig : s61_posteriors ] , with the purpose to provide an example .",
    "in fact , as mentioned before , we do not have a statistically strong model to discern among the possible density distributions .",
    "however , it is comforting to see that all the models produce similar masses ( see tables [ tab : s61statstns ] and [ tab : s61statspls ] ) . the tns model of the 9-ghz ( 17-ghz ) data generates a peaked and skewed distribution of @xmath44 , with median @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the map - model values are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these are located always in the right side of the distribution , probably due to our prior requirements to fit the shell within the edge of the nebula , rather than the edge of the image frame .",
    "we remind the reader that the modelling of the 9 ghz data was proposed in order to test the code and to compare the results with our previous estimation ( @xmath300.8  @xmath39 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the value derived with this new approach is about 2.7 times smaller than the previous estimate .",
    "however , because of the asymmetry of the nebula at 9 ghz , the model seems to underestimate , on average , @xmath33 ( see panel 7 in fig . [",
    "fig : s61_posteriors ] ) . according to this",
    ", the two methods may not disagree each other.the advantage of the proposed new method is that it requires no assumptions about the nebula depth @xmath49 .",
    "the derived mass from the fits of the 17 ghz data ( @xmath50 ) are more representative , because of the smaller @xmath51 than the 9 ghz data .",
    "the mean profile of @xmath52 reproduces satisfactorily @xmath33 ( see bottom panel 7 in fig . [",
    "fig : s61_posteriors ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the angular resolution achieved at 9 ghz affects the nebular size , resulting in a larger volume to model . for further analysis",
    "we will then adopt the map model from the fit of the 17 ghz data .",
    "the mass estimated here are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the one derived by @xcite from the @xmath53 luminosity and from optical emission lines .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to a combination of different assumptions and methods .",
    "for instance , @xcite assumed for the lmc a distance of 51.2 kpc and measured a size for the nebula of 7.3 arcsec ( i.e. , 1.8 pc ) from an image with a poorer resolution .",
    "their estimation of the average electron density was also uncertain due to uncertainties of the [ sii ] 6717/6731 ratio .",
    "it would be interesting to compare our results with integral field unit observations of the nebula around s61 .    as shown in section [ sec : analysis ] , there are hints of inhomogeneities in the nebula . following @xcite , who described the radio spectrum of a clumped stellar wind , we can assume discrete gas clumps of relatively higher density ( @xmath54 ) , embedded in a lower - density medium ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "both the clumps and the inter - clump medium are assumed optically thin .",
    "the clumps are distributed randomly throughout the volume of the nebula . if we define @xmath56 as the fractional volume which contains material at density @xmath54 , then eq . ( [ equ : emmeasure ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath57    the ionised mass in the nebula can be underestimated if not corrected for clumpiness .",
    "in fact , in the simple case of an empty inter - clump medium ( @xmath58 ) , it is possible to demonstrate that @xmath59 .",
    "for a filling factor @xmath60 the ionised mass would be about 41@xmath61 larger than in the case of a homogeneous nebula . for a more generic case , the factor to correct the estimated ionised",
    "mass is @xmath62 .",
    "the ionised mass could also be underestimated in the emitting regions with a positive spectral index . in the specific case of s61 , where @xmath63 , the optical depth is @xmath64 . moreover",
    ", the region with positive @xmath65 is small .",
    "we can assume that the underestimation of mass is negligible .    by using our model",
    ", we can derive the ionising photon flux as @xmath66 with @xmath67 the recombination coefficient of the second energy level of h. it is still not known if the nebula is density or ionisation bounded , therefore we have to keep in mind that this could be a lower limit .",
    "we find @xmath68 , which corresponds to a supergiant of spectral type later than b3 .",
    "this is too cold compared with s61 s star @xcite .",
    "note that the recombination time for such a nebula would be typically of some thousands years , implying that lbv variability from the ionising source would be negligible .",
    "this may indicate that the nebula is density - bounded and that part of the stellar uv flux escapes from the nebula .    .",
    "the plot does not contain information about the present - day mass - loss rate . ]",
    "starting from our best model in section [ sec : model ] , we now derive the mass - loss history of s61 with high temporal resolution , keeping in mind that we could not constrain the electron density distribution .",
    "if we know the expansion velocity of this nebula , each voxel of our datacube corresponds to a kinematical age .",
    "for instance , in the case of s61 the expansion velocity is 27 @xmath69 @xcite and each voxel in the model of the 17 ghz data has a 1-d size equal to 0.1 arcsec , which , at the assumed distance of the lmc ( 48.5 kpc ) corresponds to 7.3@xmath70 and therefore to a kinematical interval of @xmath71 .",
    "we know the mass in each voxel and therefore we can derive the average mass - loss rate @xmath72 in intervals of @xmath73 . according to the shell geometry adopted for the s61 nebula , we can assume that the star has lost mass isotropically .",
    "we can finally integrate @xmath72 over shells of radius @xmath16 and thickness @xmath74 , where @xmath16 can vary between 0 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the number of pixels in each dimension of the cube ) .",
    "the resulting mass - loss rates for s61 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : s61massloss ] are consistent with our non - detection of the stellar wind in the radio maps .",

    "in fact , with an expected flux density of @xmath124 ( case @xmath125 ) , spread across 16.7 alma synthesised beams , the average brightness would be @xmath126 and a sensitivity of @xmath127 was needed for a @xmath128 detection .",
    "note that the extrapolated flux density at the alma frequency is consistent with the upper limit derived from the map : the rms - noise ( @xmath129 ) , integrated over the area corresponding the ionised nebula , yields a 3@xmath79 upper limit of @xmath130 .",
    "using the flux density extracted from the best fit ( case @xmath114 ) at the alma frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , we derived a dust mass @xmath131 to @xmath132 , considering that @xmath133 , and assuming @xmath134 .",
    "this means a low gas - to - dust ratio for the lmc .",
    "it suggests that the sub - mm emission might be even lower than that computed from the flux density distributions based on the mid- and far - ir data .",
    "the extinction map resembles the dusty nebula around the galactic lbv iras 18576@xmath9034 @xcite .",
    "this was also observed with visir in the filters pah2@xmath1172 and q1 .",
    "they derived for the mid - ir nebula a dust component of temperature ranging from 130 to 160 k. iras 18576@xmath9034 has a mid - ir nebula of 7 arcsec diameter , corresponding to 0.35 pc at the distance of 10 kpc .",
    "it has a physical size which is about half that of s61 , but in the sky the two sources have similar angular size .",
    "we rescaled the iras 18576@xmath9034 visir maps to the distance of the lmc , and we derived from the maps a mean value of @xmath135 in the pah2@xmath1172 filter and @xmath136 in the q1 filter .",
    "this means that with our visir observations , we would have detected at @xmath137 in the pah2@xmath1172 filter image a nebula like iras 18576@xmath9034 .",
    "the sensitivity reached in band q1 would have not been sufficient to detect the nebula .",
    "@xcite derived for iras 18576@xmath9034 a dust mass of @xmath138 ( depending on the assumed dust composition ) and @xcite derived a mass of @xmath139 for the ionised gas .",
    "this suggests the dust content in the nebula around s61 is similar in mass to that estimated in iras 18576@xmath9034 .",
    "conversely , the ionised mass in s61 is only a small fraction ( 1/20th ) of the mass in the iras 18576@xmath9034 nebula , despite s61 s nebula diameter ( @xmath140 ) being about 3.5 times bigger than iras 18576@xmath9034 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "we recall , however , that iras 18576@xmath9034 has an estimated bolometric luminosity higher than s61 ( @xmath142 , * ? ? ? * ) and the mass , through the mass - loss quadratic dependence on luminosity , has a stronger effect than the metallicity .",
    "the inner shell around wray 15 - 751 , which has a luminosity similar to s61 , extends up to @xmath143 , similar to s61 and has gas and dust masses of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively @xcite , more massive than the s61 nebula .",
    "this may suggest that s61 s mass - loss has been less efficient over time than the mentioned galactic lbvs .",
    "the dust production does not seem significantly different .",
    "however , a potential issue for this comparison is the larger uncertainty of the galactic lbvs distances than those of the magellanic objects .",
    "in this work we presented high spatial resolution observations from the radio to the mid - ir of the nebula associated with the candidate lbv s61 . it was detected only in the centimetre band .",
    "the nebula has a morphology resembling a shell , as in the optical , but in the radio there is more sub - structure .",
    "the emission mechanism is optically thin free - free , as evidenced by the spectral index map , although there are regions that suggest self - absorption .",
    "we developed and made publicly available a code in python that permits to model the 3-d electron density distribution and to derive the mass in the nebula .",
    "we tried different geometries for the shell ( truncated gaussian , constant density and power - law @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) and we found that at least three of these geometries give similar - quality results .",
    "for all the well - fitting models , the derived ionised mass is always about 0.1 m@xmath148 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than previous estimates and also a few factors smaller than the mass of similar galactic objects .",
    "the nebula is very likely density bounded , meaning that part of the stellar uv flux escapes from the nebula . as an application of our modelled electron density distribution",
    ", we also show how to derive the mass - loss history with high - temporal resolution ( @xmath30 850 yr ) .",
    "the derived mass - loss rates are consistent with the empirical mass - loss rate for s61 , implying that the nebula was likely formed by stellar winds , rather than eruptive phenomena .",
    "the present - day mass - loss is @xmath149 @xmath81 .",
    "based on the extinction map derived from the radio map and the @xmath150 _ hst _ image , we have explored the possibility that the nebular regions with higher spectral index are dusty , by means of high - resolution mid - ir and sub - mm observations .",
    "we did not detect any point - like source , or compact regions associated with the clumps , neither with visir nor with alma .",
    "the fit of the ir flux distribution from space telescope observations suggest the presence of dust with a range of characteristic temperatures of @xmath151 and dust mass @xmath152 of @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "based on the observations with visir and alma , we exclude that the ir emission arises from a point - like source .",
    "the dust producing the infrared emission observed by space telescopes must be searched for within the angular scales of the ionised gas ( @xmath3015 arcsec ) .",
    "the dust is distributed in an optically thin configuration over the radio nebula , but not uniformly , as shown in the extinction map .",
    "the visir observations did not reach the required sensitivity to detect such extended thermal emission . with the alma observations",
    ", we obtained better sensitivity to study thermal emission , but still the nebula was not detected .",
    "we estimate that the thermal emission could be detected by deeper alma observations in the future , including 7 m antennas to enhance sensitivity on larger angular scales .",

    "we desire not only to estimate the best - fit parameters , but to quantify their uncertainty , or the _ confidence _ that we can have in the results .",
    "the most natural approach to this common parameter estimation problem is bayesian inference . using notation borrowed from statistical literature , _ bayes theorem _",
    "@xmath166 provides a straight - forward prescription how to compute the joint _ posterior _ probability distribution ( pdf ) @xmath167 of a possibly multi - variate vector of model parameters @xmath168 , given the observed data vector @xmath169 .",
    "the posterior pdf distribution is simply a product of a _ prior _ pdf @xmath170 ( i.e. any knowledge we may have of the model parameter distribution _ before _ introducing the data ) with the _ likelihood _ that the given parameter values generate a model that is compatible with the data . for normally distributed errors the likelihood is @xmath171 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the _ evidence _ @xmath172 in eq .",
    "is the normalisation ( integral of the multi - dimensional posterior pdf ) , ensuring that the total probability be unity . for the sole purpose of parameter inference ,",
    "it is not necessary to compute the evidence explicitly , since it does not change the _ shape _ of the posterior pdf .",
    "it is instead sufficient to re - normalize the posterior to unit volume a posteriori .",
    "thus , for parameter inference , only the relation @xmath173 is relevant .",
    "of particular interest for the interpretation of results are the",
    "_ marginalized _",
    "1d posterior distributions , each integrated over all model parameters but the one in question @xmath174 every @xmath175 is one of the free model parameters , and every @xmath176 is a so - called _ nuisance parameter _ when computing the marginalized posterior pdf of @xmath177 .",
    "hence the common expression `` marginalize over the nuisance parameters '' . in our application ,",
    "the marginalized posteriors are shown in panels ( 2)(5 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : s61_posteriors ] .",
    "panel ( 6 ) shows the posterior pdf of a derived quantity , which in the bayesian approach is trivial to compute , and in the `` classical '' approach , impossible .",
    "the @xmath76 model parameters span an @xmath76-dimensional volume which grows exponentially with the number of parameters .",
    "it very quickly becomes impractical to sample the entire volume .",
    "fortunately , for many problems only small sub - volumes are relevant , i.e. the likelihood is only high in small regions of the parameter volume .",
    "several methods to sample preferentially these highly significant regions have been proposed .",
    "the best - known is probably markov - chain monte carlo sampling ( mcmc ) .",
    "a particularly straight - forward mcmc formalism is the _ metropolis - hastings algorithm _ introduced by @xcite and later generalized by @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the proposal joint pdf from which the algorithm samples eventually converges towards the sought - after target posterior pdf .",
    "mcmc thus generates a chain of samples ( for every model parameter @xmath177 ) , whose histogram _ is _ the marginalized posterior @xmath178 .    a common way to characterise",
    "the marginal pdfs is to compute the median ( 0.5 percentile of the cumulative distribution function , cdf ) , and as the confidence interval ( or `` credible interval '' ) the boundaries of an inter - percentile range .",
    "for gaussian pdfs this can be the @xmath179 interval around the median , i.e. the range [ 0.1580.841 ] of the cdf . for ( slightly ) asymmetric pdfs ,",
    "an inter - quartile range is often used , i.e. [ 0.250.75 ] .",
    "while the posteriors in our application are not always gaussian , for consistency we will report as the confidence interval the @xmath179 range around the median throughout ."
