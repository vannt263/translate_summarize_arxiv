    "what is the difference between very low @xmath0 stars compared to solar metallicity stars ?",
    "lower @xmath0 stars are more compact due to lower opacities . for example",
    ", the radius of a 20 @xmath3 star at @xmath1 is about 1/4 of a 20 @xmath3 star at solar metallicity .",
    "it is also more difficult for very low @xmath0 stars to reach the red supergiant ( rsg ) stage .    for metal  free stars ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the cno cycle can not operate at the start of h  burning . at the end of its formation , the star contracts until it starts he  burning because the pp  chains can not balance the effect of the gravitational force .",
    "once enough carbon and oxygen are produced , the cno cycle can operate and the star behaves like stars with @xmath5 for the rest of the ms .",
    "shell h  burning still differs between @xmath5 and metal  free stars .    due to fragmentation and cooling properties of metal  free gas , the first stars formed are thought to have been more massive than solar metallicity stars but by how much and for how long is still debated @xcite . in particular , the nucleosynthetic products of pair  instability sne are not seen at the surface of extremely metal poor stars observed in the halo of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "since mass loss depends on metallicity one expects to have much weaker winds at very low @xmath0 .",
    "however , the important point is to know which elements contribute the most to opacities and mass loss .",
    "are these the iron group elements or light elements like cno ? in this work , it was assumed that all elements have the same importance .",
    "theoretical studies have started answering this question @xcite and this topic will be studied further in a future work .",
    "the stellar evolution code used to calculate the stellar models is described in detail in hirschi  @xcite .",
    "convective stability is determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "convection is no longer treated as an instantaneous mixing but as a diffusive process from oxygen burning onwards .",
    "the overshooting parameter is 0.10.2 h@xmath6 for h and he  burning cores and 0 otherwise .",
    "the reaction rates are taken from the nacre @xcite compilation .",
    "the mass loss is proportional to the square root of the metallicity .",
    "it is also dependent on the surface rotation velocity . the centrifugal force is included in the structure equations .",
    "the processes taken into account , which induce transport and mixing of angular momentum and matter , are meridional circulation and dynamical and secular shears .",
    "stellar evolution models studying the metallicity dependence were calculated @xcite .",
    "in addition , two grids of models were calculated , one for metal  free stars @xcite and one for very low @xmath0 stars at @xmath1 , which corresponds to the second stellar generation @xcite .",
    "the initial velocity of the models range between 500 and 800 @xmath7 and were chosen such that the angular momentum ( and ratio of the initial velocity to the critical velocity ) of the models are similar to solar metallicity models with an initial velocity of 300 @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that stars are much more compact at very low @xmath0 explains why initial surface velocities are higher at very low @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of velocity is supported by the fact that our models can reproduce the evolution of the n / o ratio ( see sect .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the standard picture is that very low @xmath0 and metal  free stars do not lose any mass before they collapse .",
    "rotation however changes this picture .",
    "first , very low @xmath0 stars reach break  up velocities ( centrifugal force added to the radiative force balancing the gravitational force ) during the main sequence .",
    "second , rotational and convective mixing enriches the surface in primary cno elements and therefore enhances mass loss . metal ",
    "free models reach break  up velocities and lose between 1 ( 25 @xmath3 ) and 10 percents ( 200 @xmath3 ) of their initial mass .",
    "note that this fraction may be higher in more massive stars . in metal ",
    "free models , the surface does not become enriched significantly in cno elements before the end of he  burning and the second effect cited above is not important .",
    "however , models at @xmath1 experience a strong enrichment in primary cno and lose a large fraction of their initial mass for masses larger than about 60 @xmath3 .",
    "the surface enrichment starts when the model enters the rsg stage and the surface metallicity becomes almost solar for cno elements . since we considered that all elements are important for mass loss",
    ", the mass loss is very high during the rest of the rsg stage .",
    "figure [ m85 ] ( _ left _ ) shows the structure evolution of the 85 @xmath3 model .",
    "the top solid line represents the total mass of the model .",
    "the model loses about 10 percents of its initial mass due to the break - up phenomenon during h  burning and then more than half of its initial mass during the rsg stage .",
    "this model produces a wo  type wr star and retains enough angular momentum in its core ( fig .",
    "[ m85 ] _ right _ ) to produce a gamma  ray burst ( grb ) via the collapsar model .",
    "therefore , from the second stellar generation , our models predict important mass loss and snic  grb events .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the standard picture where this model would not eject any of its matter during its lifetime or when it collapses to a black hole .",
    "rotationally induced mixing has an important impact on nucleosynthesis . carbon and oxygen produced into the he ",
    "burning core are mixed in the h  burning shell and large amounts of primary nitrogen are produced . at very low @xmath0 ,",
    "rotationally induced mixing may increase the nitrogen production by a factor 1000 or more .",
    "part of the nitrogen is transformed into @xmath8ne and other intermediate mass elements via double alpha capture during shell he  burning .",
    "@xmath8ne is a neutron source for s  process in massive stars . in metal",
    " free stars , s - process is inefficient because it has to start from carbon . however , in very low @xmath0 stars , small amounts of iron group elements are present and s  process may produce interesting results since there is a high neutron to seed ratio",
