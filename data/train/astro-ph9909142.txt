    "ogorodnikov ( 1958 ) and vorontsov - velyaminov ( 1967 ) were among the first to draw attention to a subset of edge - on spiral galaxies with disk axial ratios as extreme as 30:1 and having little or no discernable bulge component .",
    "goad & roberts ( 1981 ) dubbed these galaxies `` superthins '' and recognized that spiral galaxies selected on the basis of their thin stellar disks and extreme axial ratios also tend to possess a variety of other intriguing properties .",
    "for example , goad & roberts ( 1981 ) discovered that superthins have low emission - line intensity ratios ( [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] / [ ] ) , which in a modern perspective suggests that superthins are moderate ionization , low metallicity galaxies more like irregulars than spirals in terms of their  region properties ( see also bergvall & rnnback 1995 ) .",
    "similar trends were confirmed for larger samples by karachentsev & xu ( 1991 ) and karachentsev ( 1991 ) .    in spite of having `` classic '' double - horned global  profiles ( e.g. , matthews & van driel 1999 ) , often superthins exhibit slowly - rising , solid - body rotation curves throughout most or all of their stellar disks ( goad & roberts 1981 ; karachentsev & xu 1991 ; karachentsev 1991 ; cox _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; makarov  1997,1998 ; abe _ et al .",
    "such rotation curves are generally characteristic of late - type dwarf and irregular galaxies rather than normal spirals ( cf . casertano & van gorkom 1991 ) .",
    "not only are superthins fascinating objects in their own right , but the very nature of these galaxies makes them extremely valuable objects for exploring a variety of fundamental astrophysical problems , ranging from disk formation and evolution scenarios , to the interpretation of high - redshift galaxy populations , to constraining the stability and dark matter contents of disks ( e.g. , karachentsev 1989 ; zasov  1991 ; dalcanton & schectman 1996 ) . in spite of this ,",
    "to date only a handful of detailed studies of individual superthins have been undertaken ( e.g. , gallagher & hudson 1976 ; bergvall & rnnback 1995 ; cox  1996 ; matthews 1998 ; abe _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "measurements of the vertical structure and disk color gradients are of particular interest in the case of superthin spirals , as these can provide important clues to their evolutionary history .",
    "vertical structure measurements provide vital constraints on disk stability , dynamical heating mechanisms , and dark matter contents ( matthews 1998 ; matthews 1999 , hereafter paper  ii ) , and when combined with measures of global properties and disk color gradients , information on the star - formation histories and dynamical evolutionary histories of the galaxies can be gleaned .",
    "ugc  7321 is a superthin galaxy ideally suited to such investigations . since it is nearby ( d@xmath710  mpc ; matthews _ et al . _",
    "1999b ) , its structure can be reasonably resolved from the ground .",
    "in addition , ugc  7321 appears to suffer little from internal extinction ( see below ) , and it is nearly exactly edge - on ( @xmath588@xmath6 ) , hence projection effects will have a minimal influence on derived vertical structural parameters ( e.g. , de grijs , peletier , & van der kruit 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the analysis of ugc  7321 is simplified compared with other edge - on spirals due to the absence of a bulge component .",
    "here we present measurements of the global properties of ugc  7321 based on new multiwavelength observations including @xmath0- and @xmath1-band imaging and photometry , narrow - band h@xmath2 imaging , near - infrared @xmath3-band imaging , and  21-cm pencil beam spectroscopy .",
    "we also examine  aperture synthesis data obtained by rots , roberts , & goad ( private communication ) .",
    "we use our datasets to measure the radial and vertical color gradients in the disk of ugc  7321 ( sect .  3 ) and",
    "briefly discuss what the color gradients reveal about the evolutionary history of this galaxy .",
    "in a second paper ( paper  ii ) , we present measurements of the vertical scale height of the ugc  7321 disk .",
    "there we combine vertical structural measurements with results from the present work in order to further constrain the stability and dynamical history of ugc  7321 .",
    "we obtained near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath3-band imaging observations of ugc  7321 in may 1997 using irim on the 2.1-m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "irim employs a 256@xmath19256 hgcdte nicmos3 detector with @xmath20 pixels , yielding a field - of - view of @xmath21 per side .",
    "the detector has a gain of 10.5  @xmath22/adu and a readnoise of @xmath737  @xmath22 per pixel rms .",
    "the observations were taken in the presence of moderate cirrus , hence our @xmath3-band data can not be reliably photometrically calibrated .",
    "we obtained sets of 9 co - added , 20-@xmath23 exposures of ugc  7321 at each of 35 telescope pointings . to insure accurate flatfielding and sky subtraction , we shifted the galaxy to a different position on the detector before each series of exposures .",
    "in addition , interspersed throughout the target observations , we obtained several series of `` blank '' sky exposures at regions adjacent to the galaxy .",
    "linearization corrections to the data were made automatically during data acquisition .",
    "data reduction was accomplished using standard iraf tasks . to remove the sky background , a median was made of several groups of temporally consecutive object and blank sky exposures . from these , a median - averaged combination of 25 dark frames was subtracted to remove the structure present in the detector dark current .",
    "finally , the dark - corrected sky frame was subtracted from all dark - corrected object frames .",
    "flatfielding was accomplished by dividing by a night sky flat composed of the median of all dark - corrected sky and object exposures .",
    "lastly , the flatfielded object exposures were aligned and co - added .",
    "our resulting @xmath3-band image of ugc  7321 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note the striking thinness of the stellar disk and the complete absence of a bulge component even in the nir . at the disk center ,",
    "the vertical exponential scale height is only @xmath7140  pc ( paper  ii ) !    fig .",
    "2 shows the @xmath3-band data in the form of a contour map . because the disk is so thin , the contours",
    "have been stretched in the @xmath24-direction for clarity .",
    "note that the contours are quite regular , even near the galaxy center , suggesting that there is not significant dust absorption in the @xmath3-band .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot a major axis profile extracted from the @xmath3-band data . from this profile",
    ", we see that the disk brightness of ugc  7321 falls off somewhat more steeply on the east side ( the righthand side of fig .",
    "3 ) than on the west side .",
    "it is unlikely this can be attributed to internal extinction effects ( which should be small at nir wavelengths ) , or to flatfield errors ( which are quite small in our @xmath3-band images ) , hence this suggests a slight lopsidedness in the stellar disk of ugc  7321 .",
    "arrows overplotted on fig .",
    "3 denote `` zones '' between which the slope of the brightness profile change fairly abruptly .",
    "these zones can also be seem from visual inspection of both our nir and the optical images and are an indication that the disk surface brightness of ugc  7321 deviates somewhat from a smooth , exponential distribution ( see also sect .",
    "this makes it difficult to characterize the @xmath3-band major axis profile in terms of a single exponential scale length . as shown by matthews & gallagher ( 1997 ) ,",
    "this phenomenon is common among extreme late - type spiral galaxies , although the effect is generally lost if the light profile is azimuthally averaged .",
    "matthews & gallagher ( 1997 ) suggested these surface brightness zones may be a signature of limited dynamical evolution in some of the smallest and faintest spirals ( see also sect .",
    "2.3.3 ) .        we obtained photometrically calibrated @xmath0- and @xmath1-band ccd imaging observations of ugc  7321 in june 1997 using the 3.5-m wiyn telescope at kitt peak .",
    "in addition , we obtained narrow - band h@xmath2 and uncalibrated @xmath0-and @xmath1-band observations of the galaxy with the wiyn telescope in april 1997 .",
    "the direct imaging camera on the wiyn telescope employs a thinned stis 2048@xmath192048 ccd with @xmath25 pixels , yielding a field - of - view of @xmath77@xmath26 per side .",
    "the ccd gain was 2.8  @xmath22 per adu , and readnoise was @xmath78  @xmath22 per pixel rms .",
    "exposure times were 900@xmath23 in @xmath0 , 600@xmath23 in @xmath1 , and 1500@xmath23 in h@xmath2 .",
    "seeing during both the april and june observations was @xmath7@xmath27 fwhm .",
    "the wiyn telescope takes advantage of the best seeing on kitt peak through a combination of thermal controls , active optics , and dome ventilation systems .",
    "this , combined with the small pixel scale of the wiyn ccd imaging camera , makes wiyn an ideal facility for obtaining the data necessary for detailed studies of disk structure and color gradients of galaxies .",
    "our ccd images were reduced using standard iraf tasks .",
    "individual frames were overscan corrected and bias subtracted in the usual manner .",
    "flatfielding was accomplished by dividing by a mean of 5 dome flats taken in the appropriate filter .",
    "the wiyn ccd contains a bad column which was corrected in our images by interpolation from the two adjacent columns .    both the april and the june observations were obtained during dark time .",
    "photometric calibration for the june run was accomplished by monitoring two standard star fields from landolt ( 1992 ) at two different air masses and then applying standard color term corrections to convert from wiyn natural magnitude system to the landolt system .",
    "the total formal dispersion in our wiyn magnitude zero points is @xmath280.03 magnitudes ; the validity of our transformations was checked via comparisons with other recent wiyn photometric solutions .",
    "errors in the colors are approximately @xmath280.02 magnitudes .",
    "sky brightnesses during our observations were @xmath2922.1  mag  arcsec@xmath8 and @xmath3019.8  mag  arcsec@xmath8 .    our @xmath1-band image of ugc  7321",
    "is shown in fig .  4 & 5 .",
    "note the very diffuse , low surface brightness ( lsb ) appearance of the disk in spite of its edge - on geometry .",
    "several background galaxies are clearly visible through the disk ( e.g. , fig .",
    "6 ) , implying internal extinction is low .      our continuum - subtracted h@xmath2 image of ugc  7321",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "7 . due to cirrus",
    ", we were unable to obtain a flux calibration for this frame .",
    "however , qualitatively , this image shows that h@xmath2 emission is present out to radii of at least @xmath31@xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the distance from the galaxy center measured along the disk major axis in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "7 that the bulk of the h@xmath2 emission in ugc  7321 is confined to a region near the disk midplane roughly 4@xmath34 thick , although diffuse emission is clearly visible at @xmath24-heights of up to @xmath35 at galactocentric radii @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "we note however that there is a relative dearth of emission within a region offset 8@xmath34 to the east of the disk center ( fig .",
    "this `` gap '' is @xmath38 wide and contains faint plumes of emission extending to @xmath397@xmath34 out of the galaxy plane .",
    "we also see marginal evidence of several other thin filaments which are more extended in @xmath24-height .",
    "deeper narrow - band images are clearly needed to establish whether the central h@xmath2 feature could be a signature of blowout from the disk , and whether ugc",
    "7321 may indeed contain a diffuse , ionized medium extended to large @xmath24-heights , analogous to that seen in more luminous edge - on spirals ( cf .",
    "dettmar 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "we performed surface photometry on ugc  7321 using routines from the iraf stsdas analysis package . with the `` ellipse '' program ,",
    "we fit a series of 9 concentric ellipses to the ugc  7321 images . position angle and ellipticity of the ellipses",
    "were determined from the outermost galaxy isophotes and were kept fixed throughout the fitting .",
    "the galaxy center was chosen to be the position of peak brightness ; this location was identical in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and @xmath3 ) frames .",
    "foreground stars , cosmic rays , and background galaxies within the aperture were removed via background interpolation using the iraf task `` imedit '' .",
    "sky values were determined by measuring the sky counts in each of several rectangular apertures at various locations on the image ( see matthews & gallagher 1997 ) .    because ugc  7321 is so close to edge - on , elliptical apertures are not ideal fits to the galaxy isophotes .",
    "nonetheless , these apertures allow us to measure aperture magnitudes and colors for ugc  7321 , and permit an estimate of the mean exponential scale length of its disk .",
    "although the ellipticity of the fitted isophotes is an unreliable method of determining the inclination of near edge - on galaxies , our derived value ( @xmath40 ) is consistent with the inclination we estimate from the slight asymmetry of the dust features along the galaxy major axis .",
    "our derived photometric parameters for ugc  7321 are given in table  1 .",
    "errors for the aperture magnitude measurements were computed following matthews & gallagher ( 1997 ) and take into account sky , flatfield and poisson errors , as well as the scatter in the photometric solution .",
    "large - scale flatfield errors are the dominant source of uncertainty ; the maximum amplitude of the flatfield variations was @xmath71% of sky in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our aperture magnitudes are in good agreement with previous photoelectric values reported by tully ( 1988 ; @xmath41=13.86 ) and de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ; @xmath42=12.99 ) .",
    "9 shows our azimuthally averaged @xmath0-band radial surface brightness profile of ugc  7321 . although we noted in sect .",
    "2.1 that the disk of ugc  7321 is slightly lopsided and shows deviations from a perfect exponential , an azimuthally - averaged brightness profile permits determination of a `` mean '' scale length which is useful for offering a global characterization of the size scale of the disk .    because ugc  7321 is viewed close to edge - on",
    ", one must take into account projection effects in analyzing the projected light profile and in deriving an exponential scale length .",
    "for a disk with an exponential radial brightness distribution viewed exactly edge - on ( @xmath43 ) , the projected radial brightness profile along the galaxy midplane ( @xmath24=0 ) is expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the modified bessel function of first order ( e.g. , van der kruit & searle 1981 ) . at small radii ( @xmath46 ) , this expression can be approximated as @xmath47.\\ ] ] note this implies a slight flattening of the light profile will be observed at small radii compared with a simple , unprojected @xmath48 function . at large radii ( @xmath49 ) , one can write @xmath50 ( see van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .",
    "because of the @xmath51 term , this produces a slightly less steep light profile than a pure exponential function with the same scale length . as a result ,",
    "a scale length derived from fitting a simple , unprojected exponential profile to an edge - on disk will be overestimated . at @xmath52-@xmath53",
    "this effect is @xmath710% ( e.g. , van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .    to derive the scale length for ugc  7321 ,",
    "we have fitted a model projected exponential light profile to our data .",
    "our model is overplotted on fig .",
    "9 . for the purpose of deriving a scale length ,",
    "the slight deviation of ugc  7321 from the edge - on ( @xmath43 ) case is not significant . from our fit",
    "we derive a scale length of @xmath54=44@xmath55 ( compared with @xmath54=51@xmath56 we derive from simply fitting the function @xmath57 to the disk at intermediate @xmath33 ) .    a comparison between the data and our model ( fig .",
    "9 ) shows that in spite of lacking a bulge component , ugc  7321 exhibits a light excess at small radii compared with the prediction of an exponential disk .",
    "the @xmath0-band _ measured _ central surface brightness of ugc  7321 ( before correction to a face - on value ) is 21.6  mag  arcsec@xmath8 , while that predicted from extrapolation of the exponential fit to small @xmath33 is @xmath70.35 magnitudes fainter .",
    "interestingly , this excess is even more pronounced in the @xmath1-band and appears to correspond to a distinct region in the color map of ugc  7321 ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "this strengthens the suggestion that ugc  7321 appears to have a multi - component disk that is more complex than a simple , pure exponential ( see also sect .",
    "in addition , we note that at @xmath58 our observed light profile falls off faster than the projected exponential model , suggesting the stellar disk of ugc  7321 may be truncated ( cf .",
    "barteldrees & dettmar 1994 ) .",
    "however , this latter trend should be confirmed with deeper observations on a wide - field ccd where sky subtraction and flatfielding can be accomplished with greater accuracy .      for an optically thin disk which is exponential in both the @xmath33 and @xmath24 directions , and which is observed inclined at 90@xmath6 , the face - on central surface brightness will be @xmath59 times the observed edge - on value . here",
    "@xmath60 is the exponential scale height ( cf .",
    ", van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .",
    "transformations from observed surface brightness values to face - on values at other radii may be derived from equations 1 - 3 above . using a thin - disk approximation ( see the appendix ) we have derived the additional corrections to these values required for the case where a is disk observed at an inclination slightly less than 90@xmath6 .",
    "after also taking into account internal extinction corrections ( see sect .",
    "3.2.2 ) , we then find that if projected to face - on , the disk of ugc  7321 would have an _ observed _ @xmath0-band central surface brightness of @xmath723.4  mag  arcsec@xmath8 , an extrapolated central surface brightness of @xmath723.8  mag  arcsec@xmath8 , and a mean total disk surface brightness @xmath6127.6  mag  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "thus ugc  7321 is a very lsb galaxy , and much of its disk would likely be nearly invisible if viewed closer to face - on . as shown below , the internal extinction in ugc  7321 appears to be quite low , thus its lsb appearance must result from a rather low current star formation rate .",
    "further evidence that the seemingly `` anemic '' nature of ugc  7321 is due to minimal current star formation comes from comparing its blue luminosity to its far - infrared luminosity . using the _ iras _ 60@xmath62 m and 100@xmath62 m fluxes for ugc  7321 from the ned database and sage ( 1993 ) , respectively , and following the prescription of rice  ( 1988 )",
    ", we derive @xmath63=7.8@xmath64 , a value nearly two orders of magnitude fainter than the mean for scd / sd spirals in the ugc catalogue ( roberts & haynes 1994 ) . using our blue luminosity ( corrected for internal extinction ) , we find that @xmath650.08 for ugc  7321 .",
    "a comparison with rice  ( 1988 ) reveals that such low @xmath66 ratios are commonly found only in two classes of galaxies : ( 1 ) old , red early - type spirals , de s and s0 s with few young stars ; ( 2 ) gas - rich , extreme late - type spirals with diffuse , extremely lsb disks .",
    "examples of the latter group of objects include the nearby galaxies ngc  4395 ( sd",
    "iv ) , ngc  45 ( sdm  iv ) , and ic  2574 ( sm  iv - v ) .",
    "all three of these galaxies have @xmath670.10 , @xmath16@xmath681 , blue optical colors , and highly transparent disks ( e.g. , sandage 1961 ; matthews  1999a ) .",
    "using our @xmath0- and @xmath1-band wiyn data , we have produced a @xmath9 color map of ugc  7321 ( fig .",
    "a variety of structure is evident in this map , including significant @xmath9 color gradients in both the vertical and radial directions .",
    "we discuss these features in detail below .",
    "the global @xmath9 color of ugc  7321 is 0.99 , as measured within the outermost observed isophote ( 25.2  mag  arcsec@xmath8 in @xmath0 before correction for inclination ) , and after correction for galactic foreground extinction .",
    "this @xmath9 color is a typical value for a normal , late - type spiral ( cf . lauberts & valentijn 1988 ; de blok , van der hulst , & bothun 1995 ) .",
    "this suggests that in spite of its edge - on geometry , the disk of ugc  7321 does not suffer severely from internal reddening due to dust .",
    "we return to this issue below .      near the center of the ugc  7321 disk ,",
    "our color map reveals a small , very red ( @xmath691.5 ) nuclear feature , only a few arcseconds across ( fig .",
    "this feature is offset @xmath75@xmath34 to the east of the disk center as determined from the brightness peak of the @xmath1- and @xmath0-band images .",
    "one possibility is that we are seeing the signature of an embedded nucleus .",
    "however , although compact star cluster nuclei are common in late - type low - luminosity spirals with diffuse , lsb disks ( matthews & gallagher 1997 ; matthews  1999a ) , we do not see any direct evidence of such a feature in ugc  7321 in either our wiyn images or in images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( matthews  1999b ) .",
    "nonetheless , the location of the compact red feature in the @xmath9 color map is near to that of the peculiar h@xmath2 emission features shown in fig .  8 .",
    "the optical longslit spectrum of ugc  7321 obtained by goad & roberts ( 1981 ) also shows a possible kinematic disturbance in the h@xmath2 emission at this location .",
    "these are hints that some interesting physical processes are at work near the center of the ugc  7321 disk .",
    "further investigation of this region via high resolution spectroscopy , deep h@xmath2 imaging , and nir colors may be fruitful .",
    "surrounding the compact red feature , our color maps reveal a more extended red region ( @xmath701.2 ) , visible to @xmath71 on either side of the disk center and showing a rather abrupt boundary ( see also below ) .",
    "intriguingly , the extent of this region corresponds very closely to the region over which we observe a light excess over a pure exponential disk fit ( sect .",
    "this raises the possibility that this red central region might possibly represent an ancient central starburst , the core of the original protogalaxy , or perhaps even a kinematically distinct disk subsystem analogous to the bulge of normal spirals .",
    "cutting into the red central region discussed above are thin blue bands of stars visible along the midplane of the galaxy .",
    "these bands grow both thicker and bluer with increasing distance from the galaxy center . at @xmath7220@xmath34 ,",
    "this layer has @xmath691.05 , reaching @xmath690.85 at @xmath73=@xmath37 , @xmath690.80 at @xmath72@xmath74 , @xmath690.45@xmath75 at @xmath33=@xmath76 , and @xmath690.55@xmath280.10 at @xmath77@xmath76 .",
    "thus , from the nuclear region ( where @xmath78 ) to the outer disk edge we see a total @xmath9 color change of up to 1.05 magnitudes along the major axis of ugc  7321 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "11@xmath79 , which shows @xmath9 color profiles of ugc  7321 extracted along the major axis , as well as @xmath80 north ( through the red nuclear feature ) , @xmath81 south , and @xmath82 south relative to the major axis , respectively .",
    "the extracted profiles were averaged over 12-pixel - wide strips and then smoothed , hence the red color of the compact red central disk feature is slightly subdued in the profiles shown in fig .",
    "because we are interested in accurately measuring colors in the faintest regions of the outer disk , we extracted our color profiles from our our uncalibrated @xmath0 and @xmath1 images , which have slightly superior flatfields to our photometrically - calibrated data ; maximum amplitude variations of the flatfields are @xmath71% of the sky in @xmath0 and @xmath70.5% of the sky in @xmath1 .",
    "we then used comparisons between high signal - to - noise inner disk regions to calibrate the absolute colors from the photometrically - calibrated images .",
    "the maximum uncertainties expected from the combination of sky subtraction and flatfield errors are overplotted as dotted lines on fig .",
    "although signal - to - noise in the outer disk is low , the profiles extracted at all four positions parallel to the major axis show regions with @xmath830.60 , suggesting these blue outer disk colors are real .    finally , we draw attention to the presence of a faint , thicker , but highly flattened disk of unresolved stars visible in our color map surrounding the ugc  7321 disk at @xmath36@xmath84 .",
    "this component has @xmath691.1 and shows little change in color with galactocentric distance ( fig .",
    "12 ) . based upon the observations of galactic globular clusters ( see secker 1995 ) ,",
    "old , metal - poor stellar populations are expected to have @xmath130.8 , hence the highest @xmath24-height stars in ugc  7321 appear to represent an `` old disk '' population ( see also below ) .",
    "bluing as a function of increasing galactocentric distance is a well - known feature of spiral galaxy disks ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ) .",
    "de jong ( 1996 ) has demonstrated through monte carlo simulations that in face - on spirals , this observed radial bluing generally can not be accounted for by dust .",
    "he shows that for realistic models , dust creates color gradients of less than 0.3 magnitudes in @xmath9 , and argues instead that the observed radial color changes in spirals are indicative of star formation progressing radially outwards in disks over time , leading to stellar age and metallicity gradients .",
    "this picture is consistent with a number of semi - analytic galaxy formation models where galaxy disks are built `` from the inside out '' ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ; mo  1998 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the radial color gradient we observe in ugc  7321 ( @xmath85 ) is significantly larger than typical gradients in the de jong sample ( where typically @xmath860.6 magnitudes , even when bulge light is included ) .",
    "moreover , in most spirals observed edge - on , radial color gradients are generally found to be small ( e.g. , sasaki 1987 ; aoki  1991 ; wainscoat , freeman , & hyland 1989 ; bergvall & rnnback 1995 ) or negligible ( e.g. , hamabe  1980 ; jensen & thuan 1982 ; de grijs 1998 ) .    unfortunately , in edge - on spiral galaxies , color gradients become more difficult to interpret physically , particularly since internal extinction can be quite significant near the galactic plane .",
    "the net effect can be both an alteration in the galaxy luminosity profile , and a reddening of the observed optical colors which can vary as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath24 . therefore in order to determine what fraction of the color gradients we observe in ugc  7321 are due to true age and/or metallicity gradients , we must include an assessment of the role of dust in this galaxy .    in practice , accurately quantifying the effects of dust on the observed colors and luminosity distribution in a galaxy is a complicated problem ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ; xilouris  1999 )",

    "han 1992 ) . as a result",
    ", the effects of internal extinction in a given galaxy are ideally derived using a combination of sophisticated radiative transfer models and empirical measurements ( e.g. , xilouris  1999 ) . such modelling beyond the scope of the present work , so here we derive some fundamental constraints on the effects of dust in ugc  7321 using a very simple model .",
    "although some authors have argued that the internal extinction in lsb galaxies may be almost negligible ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1994 ; tully  1998 ) , these claims have only rarely been tested in edge - on systems ( e.g. , goad & roberts 1981 ; kodaira & yamashita 1996 ; bergvall & rnnback 1995 ; karachentsev 1999 ) .",
    "we have already mentioned several lines of evidence that the internal extinction in ugc  7321 is low ( regularity of the @xmath3-band isophotes ; visibility of background galaxies through the disk ; low @xmath66 ratio ; correspondance between the galaxy center in @xmath3- and @xmath0-band ) .",
    "nonetheless , visible inspection of our wiyn images shows the galaxy is clearly not completely devoid of dust , and a number of individual clumps ( possibly molecule - rich dark clouds ) can be seen in our optical images ( e.g. , fig .  5 ; see also matthews  1999b ) .",
    "in spite of this , the fact that we resolve many of these individual dust clumps instead of seeing a uniform dust lane implies that the disk of ugc  7321 is not optically thick .",
    "another test of the optical thickness of the ugc  7321 disk comes from a comparison between its optical rotation curve ( derived from longslit spectroscopic measurements of h@xmath2 emission from  regions ) , with a rotation curve derived from  measurements . from optical longslit measurements ,",
    "goad & roberts ( 1981 ) found ugc  7321 to have a slowly rising , solid - body rotation curve throughout much of its stellar disk .",
    "if a galaxy disk is optically thick , the rotation curve may appear solid body regardless of its intrinsic shape , as an artifact of one s inability to observe  regions at small galactocentric radii ( goad & roberts 1981 ; byun 1993 ) .",
    "however , a rotation curve of ugc  7321 derived from  aperture synthesis measurements ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) confirms that the slow rise of the rotation curve throughout the stellar disk is indeed intrinsic ( see fig .",
    "19 , discussed below ) .",
    "once again we conclude the disk of ugc  7321 is not optically thick .",
    "dust affects the color and luminosity profiles of galaxies through both the scattering and absorption of optical photons .",
    "however , the maximum color change ( i.e. , maximum reddening ) occurs in the pure extinction case .",
    "in addition , byun , freeman , & kylafis ( 1994 ) have shown that scattering effects become decreasingly important with increasing inclination ( see also bianchi , ferrara , & giovanardi 1996 ) .",
    "since here we are primarily interested in estimating the effects of dust on the color gradient , and since we are in the optically thin regime , we can simplify the problem by considering a model of extinction due to a foreground dust screen ( see disney , davies , & phillips 1989 ) .",
    "for a given amount of dust , the screen model produces more reddening than a more realistic model of stars mixed with dust , hence it establishes an upper limit to @xmath87 as a function of radius .    to evaluate @xmath87 , we begin by attempting to attribute as much of our observed color gradient as possible to dust .",
    "we further assume that , to first order , dust extinction in the @xmath3-band is negligible ( e.g. , fig .  2 ) .",
    "in the case of zero intrinsic radial color gradient , a dust - free version of ugc  7321 would exhibit no radial color gradient in @xmath88 , hence we can use the changes we do observe in the @xmath88 color to estimate the amount of extinction at a given radius . we do not attempt to reproduce the clumpy nature of the dust in our model ( which again , would decrease any reddening effects ) , but assume the dust distribution is roughly exponential in the radial and vertical directions ( e.g. , wainscoat , freeman , & hyland 1989 ; xilouris  1999 ) . in this case",
    "the extinction along an interval from @xmath33 to @xmath89 can be expressed as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the absorption in magnitudes per unit length at a given wavelength , @xmath92 corresponds to the edge of the stellar disk , @xmath93 is the scale length of the dust , and @xmath94 is the scale height of the dust ( see also wainscoat , hyland , & freeman 1989 ) .",
    "13 shows a plot of the `` pseudo '' @xmath88 color profile of ugc  7321 along the major axis interval @xmath33=0120@xmath34 . here",
    "the @xmath1-band data were smoothed to match the resolution of the @xmath3-band observations . because our @xmath3-band data are not photometrically - calibrated , we have chosen an arbitrary normalization such that our `` pseudo '' @xmath88 color is 0 near @xmath33=80@xmath34 . in fig .",
    "13 , we see that near @xmath33=0 , the @xmath1-band light is depressed by roughly 40% relative to the @xmath3-band , corresponding to an @xmath1-band extinction @xmath950.55 magnitudes per kiloparsec .",
    "assuming the extinction law of bouchet  ( 1985 ) , we derive @xmath96=0.89 magnitudes per kiloparsec .    from fig .",
    "13 we estimate a scale length of the dust distribution of @xmath9740@xmath34 , which appears consistent with the observed dust distribution in our images .",
    "although in giant spirals , it is often assumed the dust has a similar scale length to the old stellar disk ( e.g. , kylafis & bahcall 1987 ) , or even extends beyond it ( e.g. , xilouris  1999 ) , this does not appear to hold in ugc  7321 .",
    "we see an abrupt end to the presence of resolved dust clumps beyond radii @xmath98 in both our wiyn images , and in _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images obtained by matthews  ( 1999b ) . moreover , background galaxies are readily visible through the ugc  7321 disk beyond these radii ( matthews  1999b ) , implying extinction has dropped appreciably . for the vertical scale height of the dust ,",
    "we adopt @xmath94=@xmath99 , which is half the scale height of the old stellar disk ( sect .",
    "3.3 ; see also paper  ii )",
    ".    using equation 4 , we can now derive an extinction - corrected @xmath9 color profile for ugc  7321 along its major axis ( fig  14@xmath100 ) and offset @xmath80 to the north ( fig  14@xmath101 ) .",
    "we see that even the extinction - corrected radial color gradient remains pronounced ( @xmath102 mag ) .",
    "this demonstrates that _ a significant fraction of the observed radial color gradient in ugc  7321 appears to be due to stellar population and/or metallicity gradients .",
    "_      the presence of the observed radial disk color gradients in ugc  7321 has several implications .",
    "regions with @xmath103 are too blue to be accounted for by old , metal - poor stellar populations ( e.g. , secker 1995 ) , but instead must result from a mixture of ages . without resolving these populations",
    ", we can not uniquely constrain the mix of stars present . however , the bluest colors we reliably measure in ugc  7321 ( @xmath104 ) are comparable , for example , to young regions in the moderate metallicity giant magellanic galaxy ngc  4449 ( bothun 1986 ) and to the predicted colors of the younger outer regions of a smoothly evolving galaxy with a high halo spin parameter and an age of @xmath710  gyr , as in the models of jimenez  ( 1998 ) . in either case , it is likely that youthful stars are a significant contributor to the blue colors of the outer disk of ugc  7321 ( see also bell  1999 ) .",
    "this assertion is strengthened by the presence of h@xmath2 emission in the outer disk ( fig .",
    "7 ) and the existence of resolved supergiant stars at these radii ( matthews  1999b ) .",
    "we note that edge - on , superthin lsb galaxies like ugc  7321 are especially valuable for studies of the outer regions of disks , as they may contain some of the most pristine , unevolved galaxian disk environments observable in the nearby universe .",
    "however , because these disk regions are so optically thin , they would become very difficult to detect in galaxies viewed at lower inclinations .",
    "for example , if viewed near face - on , the portions of the ugc  7321 disk where @xmath830.6 would have an observed @xmath0-band surface brightnesses of only @xmath10527.6  mag  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "such faintness levels are only rarely reliably achieved in galaxy imaging surveys due to combinations of short integration times , scattered light , limited detector fields - of - view , and flatfield uncertainties ( cf .",
    "morrison , boronson , & harding 1994 ; lequeux  1996 ) .    in spite of the potentially very young outer disk regions of ugc  7321 , its moderately red central disk ( where @xmath691.2 ) and its somewhat thicker `` old disk '' ( where @xmath691.1 ) both indicate that ugc  7321 is likely to contain stellar populations with ages in excess of 10  gyr ( see jimenez  1998 ) . as demonstrated above , accounting for a reasonable amount of reddening due to dust does not affect this conclusion .",
    "the red stellar components in ugc  7321 imply that this is not a young galaxy presently undergoing its first epoch of star formation .",
    "our observed colors and color gradients in ugc  7321 are similar to those found in other lsb spirals by de blok , van der hulst , & bothun ( 1995 ; see also impey & bothun 1997 ) .",
    "a consistent model for ugc  7321 is then that of a disk galaxy which has made stars slowly and is now seen to be under - evolved relative to typical giant spirals ( see also oneil  1997 ; jimenez  1998 ) .",
    "this would account for the low gas metallicity of ugc  7321 ( goad & roberts 1981 ) , the large  mass fraction ( sect .  4 ) , and the low density of stars ( i.e. , the low optical surface brightness disk ) .",
    "thus while lsb disks like ugc  7321 may be _ unevolved _ galaxies , we concur with the suggestion of jimenez _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) that _ lsb galaxies are not necessarily young . _    in order to preserve its relatively strong radial color gradients over many gyr , it appears that viscous evolution in the disk of ugc  7321 has been minimal . in giant spirals , viscous evolution ( which redistributes angular momentum in the disk )",
    "is often argued to be responsible for the relatively smooth exponential luminosity profiles of most disk galaxies ( e.g. , lin & pringle 1987 ) .",
    "this process is also expected to partially smooth color gradients due to stellar age and metallicity changes with radius ( e.g. , firmani , hernndez , & gallagher 1996 ) .",
    "however , such a mechanism may not be able to work efficiently in galaxies like ugc  7321 , due to both the low disk surface density ( which considerably extends dynamical timescales ) and the slowly rising rotation curve [ which produces limited shear in the inner disk regions ( lin & pringle 1987 ; see also matthews & gallagher 1997 ) ] .",
    "the gradients in the @xmath3-band major - axis profile of the ugc  7321 disk ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) and the deviation of the azimuthally - averaged profile from a pure exponential disk at small @xmath33 ( sect .",
    "2.2.3 ) may be additional signs that viscous evolution has been limited in this galaxy compared with normal spirals .",
    "finally , we note that at intermediate galactic radii , the eastern side of ugc  7321 has a slightly bluer mean color than the western side .",
    "this result is insensitive to reasonable sky subtraction and flatfield errors .",
    "one explanation could be that we are seeing the projection of a spiral arm(s ) , although it remains uncertain how much spiral structure a thin disk like ugc  7321 might actually sustain , since spiral structure is believed to be an efficient disk heating mechanism ( e.g. , lacey 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , at least some self - gravity is needed for spiral arm formation , but if the disk of ugc  7321 were completely self - gravitating , it would be highly unstable to `` firehose '' instabilities and hence to vertical thickening ( zasov , makarov , & mikailova 1991 ; matthews 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative is that there are asymmetries in the stellar distribution of ugc  7321 due to patchy star - formation ( see also gerritsen & de blok 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of vertical color gradients in galaxies offers an important clue toward the dynamical evolution of galaxian disks , since such gradients are predicted to occur as a consequence of dynamical heating processes ( e.g. , just , fuchs , & wielen 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , vertical color gradients are very difficult to measure in most edge - on spirals due to dust , contamination from the bulge component , and the effects of atmospheric seeing . to date , only a few analyses of edge - on spirals have uncovered non - negligible vertical color gradients ( e.g. , wainscoat , freeman , & hyland 1989 ; bergvall & rnnback 1995 ) , while many workers have reported such gradients to be very small or negligible ( e.g. , jensen & thuan 1982 ; de grijs , peletier , & van der kruit 1997 ) .",

    "at @xmath108 ( fig  15@xmath101 ) , we see the addition of a peak with @xmath701.45 .",
    "note its displacement from the disk midplane ; this peak is in the vicinity of the red nuclear feature discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 . at @xmath33=10@xmath34 ( fig  15@xmath109 ) , the vertical color gradient is again fairly flat ( @xmath701.2 ) , with a very slight bluing visible near @xmath24=@xmath110 . at @xmath111@xmath112 ( fig  15@xmath113 ) ,",
    "the high @xmath24 regions of the disk have nearly the same color as those at @xmath33=0 ( this is due to the `` old disk '' of red stars discussed above ) , but at small @xmath24 values , the disk has become much bluer than at smaller galactocentric radii . finally , with further increasing radius , while the color at high @xmath24 continues to stay nearly constant , the color at small @xmath24 grows increasingly bluer ( fig .",
    "15@xmath114-@xmath106 ) , consistent with the radial bluing observed along the major axis of the galaxy in fig .",
    "vertical color gradients of the type we observe over much of the disk of ugc  7321 ( i.e. redder with increasing @xmath24 height ) are predicted to occur due to dynamical disk evolution in which older stellar populations acquire higher velocity dispersions over time due to heating processes ( e.g. , fuchs & wielen 1987 ; just , fuchs , & wielen 1996 ) .",
    "ugc  7321 represents one of the few examples of this type of vertical color structure being directly observed in a galaxy disk .",
    "thus even the most dynamically cold examples of nearby galaxy disks appear to have undergone some dynamical heating . nonetheless , the exact mechanism by which older stars are dynamically heated and how they are redistributed as a function time remain uncertain ( see review by lacey 1991 ) and different mechanisms may operate in different galaxies , depending upon factors like environment , degree of self - gravity , and the size and number of molecular clouds .",
    "the relative simplicity of ugc  7321 , and its status as a relatively unevolved galaxy make this an ideal system to help place important constraints on these issues .",
    "we explore this further in paper  ii .    using the extinction parameters derived in sect .  3.2.2 , we can also estimate the effects of dust reddening on our observed vertical color gradients .",

    "19 ) are more typical of a dwarf irregular galaxy than a normal sd spiral .",
    "the origin of such vastly different disk morphologies in an otherwise similar physical parameter space remains unclear , but it may place an important constraint on galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "together the properties of ugc  7321 suggest that it is an under - evolved galaxy in both a dynamical and in a star - formation sense .",
    "nonetheless , this galaxy clearly demonstrates that even seemingly simple `` pure disk '' galaxies like the superthins are highly complex systems .",
    "when deriving central surface brightness measurements of galaxies , it is desirable to convert measured values to face - on values in order that galaxies observed at different inclinations can be meaningfully compared . however , for highly - inclined galaxies , the approximation that @xmath135 ( e.g. , freeman 1970 ) breaks down , and alternative corrections must be used . here",
    "we derive a simple formula for this purpose , using a `` thin disk '' approximation .    in our model",
    "we assume the galaxy disk is optically thin and has an exponential brightness profile along the @xmath33 direction of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath136 is the luminosity volume density and @xmath18 is the disk scale length .",
    "we also assume the disk has a finite but non - negligible thickness of 2@xmath60 , and a constant brightness along the @xmath24 direction ( see fig .  20 ) .",
    "for such a disk , the central surface brightness if viewed edge - on is expressed as @xmath137 if viewed face - on , the central surface brightness would be simply @xmath138 .",
    "now suppose our model disk is viewed at some arbitrary angle @xmath139 through a line of sight along a vector * x * ( see fig .",
    "we define @xmath140 as the angle between the line of sight and a normal to the disk .",
    "now the integrated brightness of the disk along a path from @xmath141 to @xmath142 becomes @xmath143 taking the integral , and making the substitution @xmath144 we find that @xmath145.\\ ] ] to apply this approximation to a real galaxy , one can substitute the measured radial and vertical scale heights for @xmath18 and @xmath60 respectively , provided that the conditions @xmath146 and @xmath147 both hold .",
