    "the evaluation of the effect of the correlation @xmath12 between the rates of return of assets or between the default of assets is a hot topic and is widely discussed from theoretical and empirical viewpoints .",
    "empirically , historically realized values of correlations and their implied values , which are estimated based on the market value of credit derivatives , are compared and their discrepancies , called correlation risk premium , attract investors interests from the viewpoint of portfolio management @xcite .",
    "theoretically , many statistical models are proposed for modeling credit risk of the pool of many assets @xcite .",
    "there are two categories in the models .",
    "the models in the first category use two state discrete variables which describe whether the asset is defaulted or not @xcite . in the financial literature",
    "a two - valued variable @xmath13 takes values @xmath14 and @xmath15 depending on whether the @xmath16-th asset described by @xmath17 is not defaulted or defaulted .",
    "the default probability @xmath3 is defined by the average number of defaulted assets @xmath10 per an asset as @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath19 means the expectation value . ising spin variable @xmath20",
    "is also used and it is related to @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "moody s binomial ( expansion ) approach @xcite , moody s correlated binomial model @xcite , long - range ising model @xcite are in this category .",
    "the default correlation is defined by the simultaneous default probability .",
    "if we denote the probability distribution of two asset @xmath23 as @xmath24 , the default correlation @xmath4 is defined by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the probability distributions of @xmath17 and @xmath28 and they are calculated from the joint probability distribution @xmath29 .    in the second category , the models adopt a continuous variable for the earning rate of an asset and correlation between the earning rates is introduced @xcite . on the assumption that the earing rates obey multivariate normal distribution with correlation @xmath30 , the probability @xmath31 for the simultaneous default of the @xmath16-th and @xmath32-th assets is given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the default probabilities of the @xmath16-th and @xmath32-th assets and @xmath36 is the inverse function of the normal distribution function .",
    "the variables @xmath37 mean the earing rates of the two assets . if the random variable @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) becomes lower than @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) , the @xmath16-th ( @xmath32-th ) asset is judged to be defaulted .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath42 is named as `` asset correlation '' and @xmath42 and @xmath4 are related via the equation ( [ d - a ] ) .",
    "the conditionally independent model @xcite , such as the merton based model , the credit metrix model @xcite and the copula model @xcite are in the second category .",
    "the reason why default or asset correlations are widely discussed recently is that the pricing of asset backed security ( abs ) , like cdo , needs detailed information about the probabilities @xmath43 for @xmath10 defaults . here",
    "cdo is an abbreviation for collateralised debt obligation , which is a financial innovation to securitise portfolios of defaultable assets .",
    "the portfolio of the underlying debts ( assets ) collateralizes the securitites ( obligations ) , cdo is a kind of abs .",
    "securitization by cdo , we mean to synthesize securities based on a pool of many assets , like loans ( clo ) , commercial bonds ( cbo ) etc . in the process ,",
    "layered structure is introduced and securities with high priority ( reliability ) , which is called senior tranche , and those with low priority ( called subordinated tranche or equity ) are synthesized . between the senior tranche and the equity , the mezzanine tranche with middle priority",
    "is also synthesized .",
    "the difference between them is that if some of the assets in the pool are defaulted , the security with lower priority loses its value at first .",
    "if the rate of defaulted assets @xmath44 exceeds some threshold value @xmath45 , e.g. @xmath46 for the mezzanie tranche and @xmath47 for the senior tranche , those with higher priority begin to lose their values .",
    "the equity play the role of `` shock absorber '' . by the `` tranche '' structure",
    ", the risk of the senior tranche is reduced and investors feel safe about the investment . on the other hand ,",
    "the interest rates of the securities of the equity and the mezzanine tranche are set to be higher than those of the senior tranche and the subordinated tranches are high - risk - high - return products .",
    "the default correlation becomes important when one try to estimate the expected loss in each tranche , which is essential in the evaluation of its price ( premium ) .",
    "for example , we assume a pool of @xmath0 homogeneous assets with default probability @xmath3 . if there is no correlation between the defaults , @xmath43 is the binomial distribution @xmath48 and has a peak at @xmath49 .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath50 for small @xmath3 .",
    "if the threshold value @xmath45 is large enough , the upper tranche does not suffer from the defaults in the pool .",
    "on the other hand , in the extreme case where the default correlation is @xmath51 , all assets behave in the same way and there are only two cases .",
    "one case is that all assets are not defaulted and the probability for the case is @xmath52 .",
    "the other case is that all assets are defaulted simultaneously and the probability is @xmath3 . in the strong correlation limit ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "when there occur defaults , all assets become defaulted simultaneously .",
    "both senior and subordinated tranches lose their values completely .",
    "if there occurs no default , both tranche does not suffer from any damage .",
    "the essential problem is to know the @xmath4 dependence of the probabilities @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to estimate the expected loss rate of each tranche based on @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we should also study which probabilistic model is good or useful in order to describe the behaviors of the assets .",
    "this paper deals with these problems .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in",
    ", we study the @xmath5 phase diagram of finite size long - range ising model and show that the assets begin to be correlated in the `` two peak '' phase in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the realistic magnitude of the default correlation ranges from 1 % to several % @xcite , only the two peak phase is interesting from the financial engineering viewpoint .",
    "is devoted to the calculation of the important parameter @xmath3 and @xmath4 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath0 . here",
    ", we develop a perturbation method which is based on the discussions in .",
    "up to zero - th order in the perturbation theory , @xmath43 is expressed as the superposition of two binomial distributions , corresponding to the two peaks of @xmath43 . the developed method and",
    "obtained relations are useful when one apply the long - range ising model to the evaluation and hedging of the securities with tranches .",
    "in , we study the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath9 and of the expected loss rates of the tranches . for the latter purpose",
    ", we introduce the cumulative distribution @xmath11 and discuss that they are directly related with the average loss rates of tranches . as the correlation becomes strong ( with fixed default probability @xmath3 ) , the left peak becomes taller and moves towards to the origin ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the right peak also becomes taller and shifts to @xmath54 .",
    "its area approaches to @xmath3 as @xmath4 comes close to 1 .",
    "these behaviors are different from those of the binomial expansion approach , where @xmath43 has only one peak and its shape becomes broader as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we then discuss the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath55 for large @xmath16 increases linearly with @xmath4 and the senior tranche can not avoid the default damage of the assets pool , even when we set @xmath45 to be large .",
    "this crucial behavior of the long - range ising model has been pointed out previously @xcite , we have clarified the importance in the evaluation of the tranches .",
    "is dedicated to concluding remarks and future problems .",
    "we discuss the usefulness of the long - range ising model from the viewpoint of financial engineering .",
    "we use ising spin variables @xmath56 which represent states of assets in the reference pool . here",
    "@xmath57 indicates default of @xmath16-th asset and @xmath58 means that the @xmath16-th asset is not defaulted .",
    "we denote the number of @xmath20 spins by @xmath59 , so the number of defaulted assets @xmath10 is @xmath60 .",
    "the probability distribution for the states of the assets is assumed to be described by the following canonical distribution with the long - range ising model of a finite system with @xmath0 spins and the exchange interaction @xmath1 and the external filed @xmath2 , which are measured in units of boltzmann constant times temperature .",
    "@xmath61 we do not omit the @xmath62 terms in the hamiltonian for later convenience . as is well - known",
    ", the exchange interaction @xmath63 controls the strength of the correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the external field @xmath2 favors one of the two spin states . in the actual case where the spin variable represents the states of the assets ,",
    "the default probability @xmath3 is at most a few percent and almost all assets are not defaulted ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the sign of the external field @xmath2 is set to be @xmath67 .",
    "the reason to choose the long - range ising model is that it gives the default distribution @xmath43 directly . in @xcite , another motivation for",
    "the long - range ising model has been discussed and their conclusion is that the model is the most natural choice from the viewpoint of the maximum statistical entropy principle .",
    "the two parameters @xmath68 and @xmath2 are introduced as lagrange multipliers which ensure that the default probability and the default correlation of the model are @xmath69 and @xmath4 . from the economical viewpoint",
    ", we can interpret the model as a kind of factor model . here",
    ", the term factor means the systematic risk factor or the state of the business cycle @xcite . in a boom",
    ", we have fewer defaults than in a recession .",
    "we denote the state of the business cycle as @xmath70 and assume that the defaults of the assets are independent from each other , conditional on the realization of the systematic factor @xmath70 .",
    "the joint probabilities for the assets @xmath71 and the business cycle variable @xmath70 is assumed to be written as @xmath72 here , the random variable @xmath70 obeys the probability density function @xmath73 and the denominator @xmath74 is the normalization term .",
    "condition on the realization @xmath75 , the each asset state becomes independent from each other and the default probability @xmath3 is given as @xmath76 the default probability @xmath3 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 and @xmath2 for a boom ( recession ) is large ( small ) . in order to derive the long - range ising model starting from the above factor mode",
    ", we assume that @xmath70 obeys the standard normal distribution with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 by averaging over the possible realization of @xmath70 weighted with the above @xmath73 , we obtain the expression for the long - range ising model .",
