    "the topological structure of the qcd vacuum has been the subject of many lattice investigations over the years .",
    "local patterns in topological charge fluctuations represent a significant aspect of this structure .",
    "moreover , important physical phenomena such as a large @xmath0 mass , @xmath1 dependence , and possibly spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are directly related to vacuum fluctuations of the topological charge . by the axial anomaly ,",
    "matrix elements or correlation functions involving the topological charge density operator @xmath2 can be related to relevant quantities of hadronic phenomenology .",
    "lattice qcd enables non - perturbative studies of the strong interaction from first principles , and should prove useful for studying the important topological structure of the vacuum .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining a lattice discretization for studying topology is not completely straightforward , e.g. naively discretizing the topological charge density generally leads to non - integer values for the topological charge .",
    "physical hadronic interactions also observe an approximate chiral symmetry that is described by the theory of qcd , where in the massless limit , an exact chiral symmetry is realized .",
    "unfortunately , naive transcriptions of the continuum theory explicitly break chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing @xmath3 .",
    "the wilson dirac operator  @xcite , @xmath4 contains the irrelevant wilson term , @xmath5 , that explicitly breaks chiral symmetry at @xmath6 in order to remove fermion doublers .",
    "this lattice discretisation is often improved through the introduction of a clover term  @xcite , however issues with chiral symmetry breaking still exist .",
    "one technique that has recently been used to successfully reproduce the light hadron spectrum  @xcite , is to filter the gauge links prior to applying the dirac operator .",
    "these types of fermion actions are typically referred to as uv - filtered or fat - link actions .",
    "the term `` fat - link '' comes from the smeared , _",
    "i.e. _ fat , links that are used to construct the dirac operator .",
    "one can smear either all links  @xcite , only the irrelevant terms  @xcite , or even just the relevant terms  @xcite .",
    "incorporating at least some amount of uv - filtering has been shown to reduce the effects of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no firm prescription for determining the correct amount of smearing to apply to the gauge background .",
    "one must find a balance between speeding up convergence of the dirac operator , reducing chiral symmetry breaking effects , and removing short - distance physics from the gauge field .",
    "of course , when using a fixed number of smearing sweeps @xmath7 , with a constant smearing parameter @xmath8 , the smearing procedure only introduces irrelevant terms to the action .",
    "the fat - link action therefore remains in the same universality class of qcd .",
    "nevertheless , this _ freedom _",
    ", in the number of smearing sweeps that can be applied to the gauge field , can sometimes be regarded as a drawback to fat - link fermion actions .",
    "the difficulties with implementing exact chiral symmetry on the lattice are summarized by the well known nielsen - ninomiya no - go theorem  @xcite .",
    "the no - go theorem forbids the existence of a local lattice dirac operator , with exact chiral symmetry , and is free of doublers .",
    "however , in 1982 , ginsparg and wilson  @xcite showed that the physical effects of chiral symmetry will be preserved if one can find a lattice dirac operator , @xmath9 , satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a local operator .",
    "lscher later showed  @xcite that any @xmath9 , which is a solution of  ( [ wmass : gwrelation ] ) , obeys an exact chiral symmetry .",
    "a popular solution to the ginsparg - wilson relation is the neuberger dirac operator  @xcite , @xmath12 which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ wmass : gwrelation ] ) with @xmath13 . here",
    "we consider the standard choice of input kernel , @xmath14 , the wilson dirac operator with a negative wilson - mass term .",
    "to produce an acceptable dirac operator @xmath15 must lie in the range @xmath16 . for",
    "@xmath17 there are no massless fermions , while for @xmath18 doublers appear  @xcite .",
    "varying the choice of @xmath15 within the allowed range results in a flow of @xmath9-eigenvalues , and facilitates a scale - dependent fermionic probe of the gauge field  @xcite .",
    "any value of @xmath15 in the range @xmath19 should yield the same continuum behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , simulations are performed at a finite lattice spacing @xmath3 , and empirical studies prefer @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the overlap dirac operator is extremely useful for studies of qcd vacuum structure because it satisfies the atiyah - singer index theorem , and will always give an exact integer topological charge .",
    "however , the value is not always unique and depends on the value of the wilson - mass parameter  @xcite .",
    "studies of the topological susceptibility @xmath21 , have also observed this dependence  @xcite . in particular , the study of ref .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath22 varied with @xmath15 for small values of @xmath23 , but that this dependence decreased as the continuum limit was approached .    in the following ,",
    "we extend these previous studies to include an analysis of the topological charge density @xmath2 , @xmath24 , as @xmath15 is varied . in performing an analysis of the topological charge density , rather than @xmath22",
    ", we have access to a greater amount of information than that which is learnt from the susceptiblity .",
    "a change in @xmath22 can be due to a change in the mean - square of the topological charge @xmath25 , or to a more fundamental shift in the long - range structure of the vacuum .",
    "as such , it is not possible to understand the underlying change in the topological structure from a calculation of @xmath22 .",
    "a calculation of the topological charge density is also a useful probe of the gauge field , due to its strong correlation with low - lying modes of the dirac operator  @xcite , which strongly influence how quarks propagate through the vacuum . also , while our focus is on the topological charge density , all hadronic observables on the lattice are impacted as we are examining the properties of a lattice fermion action . in recent years ,",
    "the available compute resources and algorithm enhancements have reached a point where calculations of @xmath2 using the overlap operator have become feasible  @xcite .",
    "we visualize the topological density as this is currently the most effective way to view the extra information .",
    "our analysis will focus on a comparison between the gluonic topological charge density that is calculated following the application of a smearing algorithm ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : dependence ] ) . here",
    "our decision is motivated by the growing relevance of fat - link fermion actions . by studying different smearings , we are also able to provide a direct quantitative link to the negative - mass wilson renormalization parameter of overlap fermions .",
    "we gain useful insights into the similarities and differences between these smeared actions and the overlap action , and their relative effectiveness for studies of topological vacuum structure .",
    "a central conclusion of this study , is that the `` smoothness '' of the gauge field , as seen by the overlap operator , depends on the value of the wilson - mass parameter",
    "due to the high computational effort involved in a full calculation of the overlap topological charge density , we consider a single slice of representative @xmath26 lattice configurations .",
    "the configurations were generated using a tadpole improved , plaquette plus rectangle ( lscher - weisz  @xcite ) gauge action through the pseudo - heat - bath algorithm , with @xmath27 giving a lattice spacing of @xmath28  fm .",
    "five values of the wilson - mass in the range @xmath29 are used to calculate the overlap topological charge density , @xmath30 results are reported in terms of the input parameter @xmath31 , which at tree level is related to @xmath15 by @xmath32 with the standard choice @xmath33 .",
    "note that the allowed range for @xmath31 is @xmath34 , and in the interacting theory renormalization leads one to consider @xmath35 . a single calculation of @xmath36 for one time - slice will contain @xmath37 sites of information that must be analyzed , and this most easily achieved through direct visualizations . in all figures ,",
    "we represent regions of positive topological charge density by the color red fading to yellow , for large to small @xmath36 respectively .",
    "similarly , regions of negative topological charge are colored blue fading to green .",
    "a cutoff is applied to the topological charge density , below which no charge is rendered .",
    "this allows one to observe the underlying structure of the field .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the two methods for calculating the renormalization constant @xmath38 , together with the values for @xmath39 , are compared in table  [ wmass : comparez ] . as we move down the table",
    "there is a monotonically increasing trend in the number of sweeps required to match the value of @xmath31 .",
    "we note that despite some minor variation in @xmath7 , it is possible to correlate the number of sweeps to the value of the wilson hopping parameter .",
    "we note that the average renormalization factor @xmath40 , reflecting the fact that with @xmath41 the gauge fields remain rough after @xmath42 sweeps of smearing .",
    "the value for @xmath39 remains approximately constant around @xmath43 , suggesting that after renormalizing the level of agreement between the smeared topological charge density and the overlap density is consistent .",
    "let us now consider the effect of evaluating the overlap operator on a pre - smeared gauge field .",
    "this is of some relevance to uv - filtered overlap actions  @xcite , in which all links of a gauge field are smeared prior to applying the overlap operator . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ wmass : bestmatches ] , applying the overlap operator is in some respects similar to smearing the gauge field . of interest here",
    "is whether the overlap operator , acting on a smeared gauge field , will reveal a topological charge density close to the input smeared gauge field , or whether further smearing will be needed to match the calculated @xmath36 .     computed using @xmath44 ( left ) , with",

    ", one can conclude that the `` smoothness '' of the gauge field , as seen by the overlap operator , depends on the value of the wilson - mass parameter .",
    "this is similar to fat - link fermion actions in which the smoothness is directly dependent upon the number of applied smearing sweeps .",
    "these results indicate that the freedom typically associated with fat - link fermion actions , through the number of smearing sweeps , is also present in the overlap formalism , through the freedom in the wilson - mass parameter .",
    "we also considered the application of the overlap operator to a smeared gauge field , which is of relevance to uv - filtered overlap actions .",
    "we demonstrated that , regardless of the input gauge field to the overlap operator , uv - filtering still occurs via the overlap operator .",
    "the strength of the filtering is of a comparable strength to that of the overlap acting on a hot , unfiltered configuration .",
    "when creating a uv - filtered overlap action , one must therefore take care to preserve the short - distance physics of the gauge field .",
    "the topological charge density revealed by the overlap operator is similar to that revealed after 20 to 30 sweeps of stout - link smearing with smearing parameter @xmath41 , or 2 to 3 sweeps at the standard value of @xmath52 . in this light",
