    "<S> the isospin and strangeness dimensions of the equation of state are explored . </S>",
    "<S> ria and the sis200 accelerator at gsi will allow to explore these regions in compressed baryonic matter . @xmath0sn+@xmath0sn and @xmath1sn+@xmath1sn collisions as well as the excitation functions of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the centrality dependence of charmonium suppression from the urqmd and hsd transport models are presented and compared to data . </S>",
    "<S> unambiguous proof for the creation of a novel phase of matter from strangeness and charm yields is not in sight .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of neutron - rich matter at high densities and temperatures are largely unknown . collisions of heavy rare isotopes provide an excellent tool to explore this unknown region in the phase diagram of nuclear matter . the planned rare isotope accelerator ( ria ) </S>",
    "<S> ( up to @xmath4  amev ) and the sis200 at gsi ( up to @xmath5  agev ) are the upcoming experimental facilities that will access new energy density regions for these collisions allowing to investigate the equation of state ( eos ) of compressed hadronic matter in regions ( 2 - 10 @xmath6 ) or even in directions ( @xmath7 ) which have not been experimentally accessible before .    among the most interesting open questions </S>",
    "<S> is the isospin and strangeness dependency of the eos , especially at high baryochemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> this has been the subject of intensive research , as it is not only important in the study of radioactive nuclei but bears consequences on various important astrophysical issues as well  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the eos of isospin asymmetric matter can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the isospin asymmetry , @xmath10 is the energy density in isospin symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath11 is a parametrisation for the isospin dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parametrisations for @xmath11 fall into two main categories  @xcite : ( i ) @xmath11 rises with @xmath12 , ( ii ) @xmath11 falls with increasing density @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case has the interesting feature that symmetric matter may become unstable at high densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath13 ) ratio is particularly sensitive to the high density behaviour of @xmath14  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood qualitatively within the @xmath15 resonance model for pion production  @xcite : here first - chance independent nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite yield a primordial ( @xmath13 ) ratio given by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the charged pion ratio yields information on the isospin asymmetry ( n / z ) in the dense participant matter , which depends on the high density behaviour of @xmath14  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath13 ) ratio can therefore be used to probe the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter .    for our investigation of this effect the urqmd model v1.2  @xcite is applied to @xmath0sn+@xmath0sn and @xmath1sn+@xmath1sn collisions at @xmath17  agev and @xmath18  agev beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sn ] shows the time evolution of the ( n / p ) and ( @xmath13 ) ratios . for @xmath1sn+@xmath1sn , </S>",
    "<S> both the ( n / p ) and the @xmath19 ratios are roughly time independent and of order one , as expected for the symmetric system . for the asymmetric system @xmath0sn+@xmath0sn , the ( n / p ) ratio drops during the compression phase from its initial value of @xmath20 and then saturates . at 2  agev , this saturation occurs after 15  fm / c at a value of ( n / p )  @xmath21 , whereas at 11  agev the saturation occurs earlier ( 10  fm / c ) and to a lower final value of ( n / p )  @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 ratio rises slightly during the early phase of the reaction and saturates rather later than ( n / p ) ( @xmath23  fm / c at 2  agev and @xmath24  fm / c at 11  agev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation values of @xmath25 ( 2  agev ) and @xmath26 ( 11  agev ) fall far below the first - chance @xmath15 resonance model prediction @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident , as it is not the initial but rather the local and dynamically changing ( n / p ) ratio that determines the @xmath19 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , pion reabsorptions and rescatterings reduce the sensitivity of @xmath19 to ( n / p ) . at higher energies </S>",
    "<S> , the increasing number of sequential nucleon - nucleon collisions drives the @xmath19 ratio towards @xmath28 via this mechanism .    for isospin - asymmetric matter </S>",
    "<S> , a distillation effect has recently been proposed  @xcite , which is powered by chemical instabilities in the liquid - gas phase transition driving the system towards isospin symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is similar to the well - known _ strangeness _ distillation mechanism in nuclear reactions , which has been proposed as a quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) signal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the search for the qgp and its properties has been a driving force behind years of relativistic heavy ion physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the @xmath3 ratio and the @xmath29 ratio are found experimentally to exhibit a maximum at @xmath30=10 - 30 agev and drop to half that value at 160 agev has raised speculations about the appearance of the new phase transition. the na49 collaboration has recently started an energy scan at the sps . </S>",
    "<S> first results are available now at 40 and 80 agev @xcite and support these findings . </S>",
    "<S> further studies are underway at 30 and 20 agev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss these maxima in the excitation function on the basis of conventional hadron transport theories  do they exhibit analogous maxima ? </S>",
    "<S> in that case , the interpretation of the data as a qgp signal becomes doubtful . </S>",
    "<S> the various hadron spectra are conventionally calculated with non - equilibrium kinetic transport theory ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculated kaon to pion ratio from central nucleus - nucleus collisions turns out to vary by factors as large as 2 if different transport approaches are applied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a unique interpretation of the data is questionable so far .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study the yields and ratios of protons , kaons , antikaons and hyperons from au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions in the energy range from 1  agev to 160  agev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this study is twofold : first , to find out the systematic differences between two currently used transport approaches ( urqmd @xcite and hsd @xcite ) , and second , to compare to related experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we provide predictions for experimental studies in the near future @xcite , which are also of relevance for the new gsi - proposal @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the two different transport models employed , i.e.  the urqmd v1.3 ( here an updated version has been applied ) and hsd approach have been used to describe nucleus - nucleus collisions from sis to sps energies for several years . though different in the numerical realisation , </S>",
    "<S> both models are based on the same concepts : strings , quarks , diquarks ( @xmath31 ) accompanied by hadronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that both approaches do not include any explicit phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . a common failure of both models in comparison to experimental data may </S>",
    "<S>  model independently  indicate the appearance of a novel state of strongly interacting matter .    as a general overview on the @xmath32 abundancies in central au+au and pb+pb collisions fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath33 and @xmath34 multiplicities at mid - rapidity as a function of the bombarding energy in comparison to the available data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines with open triangles show the results from the urqmd calculations while the solid lines with open squares and dashed lines stem from the hsd approach with and without potentials , respectively . at lower ags energies </S>",
    "<S> the urqmd model gives slightly less pions then hsd ( with / without potential ) , but both models overpredict the mid - rapidity data . around 10 </S>",
    "<S> agev is the `` crossing point '' of both transport calculations and at sps energies the tendency turns around : urqmd gives more pions than hsd , so that hsd is now in a better agreement with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 and @xmath36 multiplicities at mid - rapidity are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] as a function of the beam energy in comparison to data from refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : the @xmath36 abundancies are well described by both transport models . the @xmath35 yield is slightly overestimated by urqmd at ags energies and underestimated at sps energies , whereas hsd is in reasonable agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] demonstrates that an underestimation of strangeness production is not the prevailing issue in comparison to the recent data from na49  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both transport models can roughly describe - within their systematic range of uncertainties - the @xmath37 spectra and abundancies .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] contrasts the @xmath29 and @xmath38 ratios at mid - rapidity as a function of energy for central collisions of au+au ( ags ) or pb+pb ( sps ) with the data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation function of the @xmath38 ratio is roughly reproduced by both transport models , the maximum in the @xmath29 ratio seen experimentally is not described quantitatively by either hsd or urqmd . for the @xmath29 ratio both models give quite different results . </S>",
    "<S> hsd gives a monotonous increase of this ratio with bombarding energy ( in qualitative disagreement with the data as pointed out in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , whereas within urqmd the ratio shows a maximum around 10 agev and then saturates to a slightly lower value towards rhic energies , thus reproducing the behaviour of the data qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> in view of figs .  [ fig4 ] and </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] this failure is not primarily due to a mismatch of strangeness production , but more due to an insufficient description of the pion abundancies .    </S>",
    "<S> this overestimation of pion abundancies can be attributed to a number of reasons : one problem of the transport approaches used here is that detailed balance is not implemented for @xmath39 transitions with @xmath40  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus multi - particle collisions might change the dynamical picture accordingly and lead to shorter chemical equilibration times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the importance of @xmath41 transitions has been explored in an extended hsd transport approach  @xcite for antiproton reproduction by meson fusion for @xmath42 collisions at the ags and sps . in order to achieve a more conclusive answer from transport studies </S>",
    "<S> multi - particle interactions deserve further investigation in future generations of transport codes .    </S>",
    "<S> another reason for the overestimation of the pion yield might be that the pions in both transport models are treated as free particles , i.e. with their vacuum mass . </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd calculations and effective lagrangian approaches like the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model however , indicate an increase in the pion mass with temperature and density . so the overestimation of the pion yields in hsd and urqmd might be a signature for a dynamically larger pion mass </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , in - medium changes of the strange hadron properties , as known from experimental studies at sis energies , may also show up in the compressed baryonic matter encountered in the ags and sps energy range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , including all medium effects simultaneously in a consistent way might provide a more conclusive interpretation of the ratios in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , such calculations require a precise knowledge about the momentum and density dependence of the hadron self - energies which is not available so far .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] shows the excitation functions of @xmath43-hyperons ( left ) at mid - rapidity as a function of the bombarding energy for central collisions of au+au ( ags ) or pb+pb ( sps ) in comparison to data  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> both models compare rather well with data . the @xmath44 ratios ( right ) at mid - rapidity are underestimated slightly which should again be attributed to the pion excess in the transport models ( as discussed above ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the experimentally observed maxima in the ratios are qualitatively reproduced by both models , indicating that with increasing bombarding energy @xmath45-quarks are more frequently produced within mesons ( @xmath46 ) rather than in associate production with baryons . </S>",
    "<S> a similar trend is also found in statistical models  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what can we conclude from the common failures of the models studied in comparison to related experimental data and does this failure provide evidence for a new state of matter in view of a qgp ? </S>",
    "<S> in view of the large systematic uncertainties in the discussed transport approaches we can quote an insufficient accuracy in the description of the pion degrees of freedom by both transport models . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the deviations between theory and the data should not be seen as unambiguous signals for any kind of new physics .    </S>",
    "<S> another much - discussed possible qgp signal is charmonium production . here , </S>",
    "<S> new data on the @xmath47 end @xmath48 dependence of @xmath49 production in pb+pb collisions at 158  agev from the year 2000 na50 run has recently become available  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this data ( one analysis ) , along with urqmd results  @xcite ( which are in line with hsd results  @xcite ) is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsi ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the puzzling drop of the @xmath49 to drell - yan production at high @xmath50 which was present in the old , previously available na50 data is no longer present in the current na50 data . </S>",
    "<S> the new na50 data fall very close to the published urqmd calculations by spieles et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to our opinion </S>",
    "<S> , both the @xmath47 dependence and the @xmath48 dependence do no longer justify to speak of an anomalous @xmath49 suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the exploration of the isospin and strangeness dimensions of the equation of state opens fascinating new areas of research . </S>",
    "<S> especially the upcoming experimental possibilities like the planned rare isotope accelerator ria and the sis200 machine at gsi will allow to explore novel phenomena in compressed baryonic matter in great detail . while conclusive unambiguous proof for the creation of a novel phase of matter , e.g. quark gluon plasma , from strangeness and charm yields is still lacking , the hunt and quest for it has provided new insights and even opened novel fields of research . </S>",
    "<S> it has become a driving force behind modern high energy nuclear physics . </S>"
