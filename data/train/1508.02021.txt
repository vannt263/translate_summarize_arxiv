    "theories built around coupling of the electron spins @xmath16 have become the prominent models for high-@xmath7 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "a key parameter in these theories is the magentic superexchange energy @xmath10 , which is predicted to limit@xcite or set@xcite the critical temperature for superconductivity .",
    "one method of testing this has been to compare @xmath7 against @xmath10 for a variety of cupratesmunoz00,munoz02,mallet13,dean14 .",
    "the study of munoz @xmath17@xcite resulted in a @xmath18/@xmath193 k / mev .",
    "however , if the compounds vary in structures and nuances , other factors besides @xmath20 are likely to influence the @xmath10-@xmath7 plot , which are a likely source of scatter in the plot of ref .  5 .",
    "another approach has been to measure the effect of pressure on a single compound . for the case of ybco , @xmath21 has been found to initially increase under hydrostatic pressure mcelfresh88,mori91,koltz91,sadewasser00 . under pressure ,",
    "@xmath10 also increases@xcite , yielding @xmath18/@xmath22@xmath231.5 k / mev .",
    "while similar order - of - magnitudes are encouraging , it shows that the fluctuations in the slope could be large depending on materials or conditions .",
    "in fact , mallet _ _ et al.__@xcite observed a negative @xmath10-@xmath7 slope in a series of @xmath24 compounds with @xmath25=(ba , sr ) @xmath26=(la, .. lu , y ) , casting doubt on the spin - mediated scenarios .",
    "another key parameter thought to strongly affect the cuprates is the @xmath27 orbital splitting ohta91,pavarini01,sakakibara10,kuroki11,sakakibara12,yoshizaki12 .",
    "this splitting increases with increasing apical oxygen distance @xmath28 from the copper - oxygen plane .",
    "when the splitting grows , it increases the in - plane character of the holes , creating a condition favorable for superconductivity by stabilizing the zhang - rice singlet @xcite or rounding the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "a higher @xmath28 also reduces screening from polarizeable charge reservoir layers @xcite .",
    "all three options are expected to lead to higher @xmath7 .",
    "the multitude of different control parameters for @xmath11 emphasizes the importance of measuring their effects in isolation . here",
    "we measure both @xmath10 and orbital splitting in @xmath29 ( clblco ) , using resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .",
    "clblco , whose phase diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] , is a compound which allows the tuning of structural parameters independently of the hole doping .",
    "its structure is almost identical to ybco@xcite , but it is tetragonal and its chain layers are not ordered .",
    "the oxygen content @xmath9 controls the number of doped holes , only slightly affecting the lattice parameter .",
    "in complimentary fashion , ca / ba content @xmath8 changes only structural parameters such as bond length @xmath30 , buckling angles @xmath31 , and apical distance @xmath28 , while keeping the net valence fixed sanna09 .",
    "additionally , the entire doping range can be spanned from undoped to overdoped for all values of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 tunes both @xmath10 ( through @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and orbital splitting ( through @xmath28 ) over the whole phase diagram .",
    "moreover , disorder in clblco was found to be @xmath8-independent based on the line - widths measured by techniques ranging from high resolution powder x - ray diffraction agrestini14 , cu , ca , and o nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , phonon @xcite , and arpes drachuck14 .",
    "intriguingly , both @xmath10 , as measured in undoped clblco samples , and @xmath32 , were found to increase with @xmath8 by as much as 40% .",
    "in fact , the energy scale of the entire phase diagrams , including the magnetic , spin glass , and superconducting parts , scale with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such scaling was attributed to a superconductivity governed by @xmath10 ofer06,ofer08,drachuck14,wulferding14 .",
    "however , @xmath10 in the optimally doped samples , and the possible effects of the apical oxygen distance , are not known .",
    "measuring those are the main objective of this work .",
    "recent milestones in the technique of resonant inelastic ( soft ) x - ray scattering ( rixs ) have been the measurement of dispersive magnetic excitations in superconducting cuprates and iron pnictidesbraicovich09,braicovich10,letacon11,zhou13,dean13 .",
    "this , together with single - crystal clblco growths @xcite , have allowed us to measure how @xmath10 varies with @xmath8 in both underdoped and optimally doped clblco samples .",
    "the momentum dependence provided by rixs enables the precise determination of @xmath10 based on the spin - wave dispersion .",
    "fortuitously , the same probe is also sensitive to the orbital @xmath0 excitations ghiringhelli04 .",
    "here we measure of both effects simultaneously on clblco single crystals",
    ". we also use x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) to verify that the effective hole dopings are indeed the same when we compare families with different @xmath8 .",
    "we find that @xmath11 has a positive , but not proportional , correlation with @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 splittings also increase with @xmath8 , but we could not precisely isolate the @xmath33 excitation .",
    "we nevertheless determine that in this system @xmath34@xmath10 has a greater contribution ( treating it as the independent variable ) to the change in @xmath32 , compared to the out - of - plane orbital effectohta91,pavarini01,sakakibara10,kuroki11,sakakibara12,yoshizaki12 .",
    "we also observed that the change in @xmath10 is very similar in the undoped and doped samples , and the slope of the @xmath10-@xmath35 relation is identical to that of ybco under pressure .",

    "on the other hand , a @xmath0 excitation in the chain layer would be more plausible .",
    "since half of the non - apical oxygen ligands around each cu atom are missing in the chain , the coulomb energy cost for a chain @xmath0 excitation should also be about half of a plane @xmath0 excitation , which corresponds to this @xmath60 ev .",

    "while this energy is in excellent agreement with calculations for @xmath103 in nbco@xcite , and for ybco@xcite the broadness makes it difficult to identify with certainty .",

    "a non - zero dispersion suggests propagation of the orbital excitation . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath104 excitation shows similar dispersion on the negative branch , but its magnitude is roughly halved .",
    "@xmath101 also shows dispersion , but is not symmetrical about @xmath49=0 .",
    "the fitted energies for @xmath8=0.4 especially show a linear trend with a dispersion of almost 0.1 ev between @xmath106 .",
    "unlike the @xmath96 dispersion , the @xmath101 dispersion is not obvious from the raw data itself due to the wider peaks , and only becomes apparent after the fittings .",
    "although it seems counter - intuitive , asymmetric dispersion may happen in the presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it has already been observed in the spin - wave of fe ultrathin films@xcite , for example .",
    "but , as far as we know this would be the first observation of asymmetry in the dispersion of a @xmath0 excitation .",

    "the corresponding @xmath30 values for @xmath40 is @xmath30=3.91   and for @xmath39 is @xmath30=3.88  .",
    "this yields @xmath110=5.1 remarkably close to the theoretical single - ion crystal field model s value of @xmath110=5 .",
    "analysis of the ud spectra in section  [ sect : rixsud ] provided explicit @xmath10 values of 120 mev ( @xmath8=0.1 ) and 134 mev ( @xmath8=0.4 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath11 for these @xmath8 values are 57 k and 80 k respectively @xcite . in section",
    "sect : rixsod , we found that the change in @xmath10 for doped samples is comparable to the undoped case , and the two dopings furthermore exhibit very similar dispersions of the spin - excitation spectra ( refer to fig .",
    "fig : ud_od_comparison ) .",
    "it is therefore justified to apply the ud values of @xmath10 to the superconducting case , as has been assumed to be valid in other works@xcite . with @xmath8 as an implicit parameter we find that @xmath111=1.64 k / mev .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude of the average slope obtained from the study of munoz et al.munoz00 of several cuprates having different numbers of layers ( @xmath112 k / mev ) .",
    "it is even more closely aligned with the initial slope for ybco under hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath113 k / mev ) @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the increase of @xmath10 of 11.7% from @xmath8=0.1 to @xmath8=0.4 determined for the ud samples in section  [ sect : rixsud ] is in close agreement with the estimation of 11.9% we obtain by using a simple @xmath114 rule@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath96 scales as expected with distances .",
    "these results indicate that the in - plane energies @xmath115 and @xmath116 depend purely on in - plane parameters , without secondary effects arising from different ca / ba ratios .",
    "we speculate that the @xmath100 peak , which we could not properly resolve , behaves as expected from the lattice parameters variations between different clblco families .",
    "whether @xmath117 likewise depends only on the in - plane parameters is not _ a priori _ clear , since the out - of - plane lattice parameter @xmath43 , and apical oxygen distance @xmath118 are also functions of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , a number of studies@xcite focused on the effect of @xmath118 and @xmath98 on @xmath11 in various cuprate systems .",
    "we now assess the relative importance that these have for @xmath117 .",
    "since ybco and clbco share very similar structure and lattice parameters , it is relevant to compare the two .",
    "the values of @xmath111 observed in the pressure - dependence of ybco on one hand , and in the @xmath8-dependence of clblco observed here on the other , are very similar .",
    "hydrostatic pressure compresses the @xmath43-axis , decreasing the apical oxygen distance @xmath118 and increasing @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , when increasing @xmath8 ( and @xmath11 ) in clblco , @xmath118 increases @xcite . that @xmath111 is the same for ybco and clblco , in spite of @xmath118 changing in the opposite sense , leads us to conclude that @xmath118 variations do not play a major role here in determining @xmath35 .",
    "another way to reach this conclusion for clblco is to estimate the effect of the change in @xmath118 on @xmath11 by comparing with other studies .",
    "a sensitivity of roughly @xmath11930 k/@xmath120 , was shown across various cuprates by johnston et al.@xcite ( see figure 1 of ref .",
    "49 ) . in clblco powder ,",
    "as @xmath8 increases from 0.1 to 0.4 , @xmath118 increases by @xmath230.05 @xmath121 @xcite . on that basis , the effect of @xmath122 on @xmath7 in clblco would be less than @xmath123 k.    a similar effect of @xmath122 on @xmath7 results from the theoretical calculations of @xmath103(@xmath118 ) by sakakibara _",
    "_ et al.__sakakibara10 .",
    "they calculated the eliashberg eigenvalue @xmath124 which sets a limit on @xmath94 . from their calculations ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath125125 k/@xmath120 can be set , which is still too small to account for the @xmath94 variations in clblco .",
    "taken together , the above comparisons suggest that @xmath122 in clblco has very little impact on @xmath11 . by eliminating this out - of - plane influence ,",
    "it becomes more likely that the change in @xmath11 observed between different families of clblco is due to variations in @xmath10 . while @xmath11 increases by 40% ( fig .",
    "1 ) from @xmath8=0.1 to @xmath8=0.4 , @xmath10 as measured by rixs only increases by @xmath126% . from other methods ,",
    "the corresponding increase in @xmath10 for samples with the same in - plane hole underdoping was determined to be : @xmath127 from the 2-magnon raman peaks @xcite , @xmath128 from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite , @xmath129 in _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , and 40% by @xmath130sr with extraction of @xmath10 from @xmath131 @xcite . with the exception of the latter , these estimates were all considerably less than the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath94 is not proportional , as predicted by some exchange - driven theories@xcite .",
    "if a linear relationship extends down to @xmath11=0 , it would imply a threshold @xmath10 for superconductivity .",
    "to review , we measured the o @xmath36-edge and cu @xmath37-edge xas , and rixs spectra at the cu @xmath37-edge , in both underdoped and optimally doped clblco single crystals of @xmath40 and @xmath39 families which have different @xmath35 .    from the electronic structure of the xas spectra ,",
    "similar hole dopings in the superconducting samples of the different families were confirmed .",
    "as it turns out , doping does not have a critical effect on the magnon dispersion , besides a broadening of the peaks .",
    "the relative change in magnetic energies between @xmath8=0.1 and @xmath8=0.4 are furthermore similar for the doped and undoped cases .",
    "this demonstrates that rixs can distinguish between samples of slightly different @xmath10 even in the doped case .",
    "the main @xmath0 excitations were also examined and unexpectedly dispersion of up to  0.05 ev was observed , raising the possibility that these orbital excitations can propagate .",
    "more intriguingly , the dispersion of the excitation from the @xmath132 orbit appeared to be asymmetric about @xmath49=0 .",
    "higher resolution studies would be needed to clarify this dispersion . in the ud samples ,",
    "an additional 0.8 ev peak was observed , and attributed to a @xmath0 excitation in the chain layer .",
    "finally , there is a positive correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath10 with a slope consistent with the pressure dependence of both parameters in ybco .",
    "the measured spin - wave energies change with @xmath8 by an amount that would be expected from purely in - plane lattice constants change .",
    "furthermore , it is concluded that the apical oxygen distance does not change enough with @xmath8 to have a significant effect on @xmath35 .",
    "these points suggest that the @xmath35 variation with @xmath8 in clblco is purely an in - plane effect driven by orbital overlaps .",

    "<S> electronic spin and orbital ( @xmath0 ) excitation spectra of ( ca@xmath1la@xmath2)(ba@xmath3la@xmath4)cu@xmath5o@xmath6 samples are measured by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) . in this compound , @xmath7 of samples with identical hole dopings is strongly affected by the ca / ba substitution @xmath8 due to subtle variations in the lattice constants , while crystal symmetry and disorder as measured by line - widths are @xmath8 independent . </S>",
    "<S> we examine two extreme values of @xmath8 and two extreme values of hole - doping content @xmath9 corresponding to antiferromagnetic and superconducting states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 dependence of the spin mode energies is approximately the same for both the antiferromagnetic and superconducting samples . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates that rixs is sensitive to @xmath10 even in doped samples . a positive correlation between the superexchange @xmath10 and the maximum of @xmath7 at optimal doping ( @xmath11 ) is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also measured the @xmath8 dependence of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbital splittings . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the effect of the unresolved @xmath14 excitation on @xmath11 is much smaller than the effect of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be dispersion in the @xmath12 peak of up to 0.05 ev . </S>",
    "<S> our fitting of the peaks furthermore indicates an asymmetric dispersion for the @xmath13 excitation . </S>",
    "<S> a peak at @xmath150.8 ev is also observed , and attributed to a @xmath0 excitation in the chain layer . </S>"
