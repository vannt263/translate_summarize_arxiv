    "let @xmath0 be a manifold and let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the tangent and cotangent bundles of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "moreover let @xmath3 be a riemannian metric on @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding flow on @xmath1 is given by the lagrangian @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian system on @xmath5 has hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "such systems are very important examples of hamiltonian systems , since many problems in mechanics reduce to the study of geodesic flows on riemann and finsler metrics @xcite .",
    "for example , with a suitable transformation , the kepler problem can be described as the geodesic flow on a sphere @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in developing a geometrical method to investigate whether systems that can be reduced to geodesic flows on a manifold are integrable .",
    "we recall that an hamiltonian system with @xmath7 degrees of freedom is _ integrable _ if there exist @xmath7 first integrals @xmath8 with the property that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and such that they are functionally independent .",
    "in particular the definition above can be used when the hamiltonian describes the geodesic flow on a manifold .",
    "if @xmath0 is an analytic manifold and the metric @xmath12 is analytic then the flow is said to be _ analytically integrable _ if the indicated integrals @xmath13 exist and can be chosen to be analytic .    in @xcite it was proved that the geodesic flow of any analytic metric on an analytic compact two dimensional manifold of genus @xmath14 is not analytically integrable and in @xcite the discussion was generalized to @xmath7 dimensional manifolds .",
    "however it is clear that the obstructions to integrability are not only of topological origin .",
    "this is because different riemannian metrics can be associated with the same manifold , even if the topology ( of the manifold ) imposes restrictions to the possible metrics .",
    "indeed donnay @xcite and burns and gerber @xcite have constructed real analytic metrics on the sphere whose geodesic flows are bernoulli .",
    "knieper and weiss @xcite constructed real analytic metrics with positive curvature and positive topological entropy .",
    "thus , even if the sphere has genus @xmath15 they found that there are metrics on the sphere such that the geodesic flow is not analytically integrable . hence to refine the criterion of kozlov ( and taimanov ) it is necessary to find a geometrical approach that takes into account the peculiar metric defined on the manifold .",
    "moreover the topological considerations of kozlov and taimanov can be applied only to compact manifolds and it would be useful to find a technique applicable in the non compact case . the main purpose of this paper is to consider such geometrical approach that both takes into account the peculiar metric and can be applied to non - compact manifolds .",
    "the approach we consider lies on the simple idea that if you have an integrable system and you add a perturbation that destroys the initial symmetry then , unless a new symmetry appears , you obtain a non integrable system .",
    "examples of this situations are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , where suitable generalizations of the poicar - melnikov method ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) are applied to the perturbed systems . in @xcite the anisotropic manev problem is discussed for weak anisotropies , and resorting to the melnikov method the occurrence of chaos on the zero energy manifold is proven . in @xcite",
    "the broken symmetry is the rotational invariance .",
    "similarly in @xcite , where we discussed black holes immersed in uniform electric and magnetic fields , the broken symmetry was the rotational invariance .    to formalize this intuitive idea , in the next section some results of riemannian geometry",
    "are recalled , in particular the isometries , the infinitesimal isometries and some of their properties are discussed .",
    "then we observe that the equation of killing can be used to find the symmetries that preserve the equation of motion and hence if those equation have only the zero solution no first integral can be found other than the hamiltonian .",
    "in section 3 we introduce our main example : the anisotropic kepler problem ( akp ) and we show that with a suitable canonical transformation it can be reduced to the geodesic flow on a riemannian surface with non constant curvature .",
    "the anisotropic kepler problem describes the motion of one body orbiting around another considered fixed at the origin in an anisotropic space ( i.e. such that the force acts differently in each direction ) .",
    "the akp was carefully studied in a series of paper by various authors ( see @xcite for an overview of the problem and of the main results ) , but not much is known for weak anisotropies . indeed even if there was evidence of a chaotic behaviour no proof of this fact can be found in the literature ( except for the occurrence of chaos on the zero energy level that was proved in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the akp is an example of geodesic flow on a non - compact surface and hence it is particularly suitable to illustrate some of the peculiarities of the technique under discussion in this work . hence showing the nonintegrability of the akp for weak anisotropies seems an interesting application .",
    "the last section is devoted to show that the equations of killing do not have any non trivial solutions for the akp and hence that , by the results of section 3 , the anisotropic kepler problem has no analytic first integral independent of the hamiltonian .",
    "we will now recall some results and known facts from riemannian geometry that we need in order to prove the main result of the paper ; for a more detailed discussion see , for example , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath7-dimensional manifold with a riemannian metric @xmath16 .",
    "an isometry of @xmath0 is a transformation of @xmath0 which leaves the metric invariant .",
    "more precisely , given the coordinates @xmath17 on @xmath0 , a transformation @xmath18 is an isometry ( or motion of the metric ) if |g_ij(|x_1 ,  ,    group , that is often called group of motion . moreover",
    "a vector field @xmath19 is called an infinitesimal isometry ( or a killing vector field ) if the local 1-parameter group of local transformations generated by @xmath19 in a neighbourhood of each point of @xmath0 consists of local isometries .",
    "the set of infinitesimal isometries of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath20 , forms a lie algebra .",
    "now a transformation is an infinitesimal motions of @xmath0 into itself , i.e. a transformation that preserves the metric if the lie derivative vanishes , that is , if the equations of killing    l_g_ij=^k g_ijx^k + g_ik^kx^j+g_jk ^k x^i=0 [ killing ] are satisfied @xcite . in order that there may be a non - null motion we must have the additional condition g_ij^i^j 0 . the first fact to verify",
    "is that the infinitesimal isometries are all the transformations that preserve the variational problem defined by the lagrangian @xmath21 , so that we can reduce the study of the symmetries preserving the equation of motion to the study of the isometries .",
    "this problem is solved by the following    an infinitesimal transformation is an isometry for @xmath0 with the metric @xmath22 if and only if it preserves the variational problem defined by the lagrangian @xmath23 on @xmath1 . [ 3 ]    proof let us remark that a transformation is an infinitesimal isometry if and only if the lie derivative of the metric is zero , i.e. if the killing s equations ( [ killing ] ) are satisfied . on the other hand a transformation preserves the variational problem defined by the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) when the lie derivative with respect to the field @xmath19 is zero , l_(l)=^i x^i+ ^i x^j x^j x^i=0 that after few manipulations takes the form l_(l)=1 2 \\ { ^s g_ij x^s+ ^k x^i g_kj+ ^k x^j g_ik } x^j x^i=0 . [ lie ]",
    "it is trivial to see that ( [ killing ] ) implies ( [ lie ] ) .",
    "the converse is also true since @xmath24 is arbitrary and the tensor in the braces is symmetric .",
    "this concludes the proof .    with the preparations above we are well on our way to establishing the following",
    "let @xmath0 be a analytic @xmath7-manifold with riemannian metric @xmath16 and @xmath21 be the lagrangian defined on @xmath1 .",
    "if the killing s equations for @xmath0 have less then @xmath25 independent solutions the geodesic flow is not analytically integrable .    to complete the proof of the theorem we can remark that to each integral of motion there corresponds a one parameter group of transformation that preserve the equation of motion @xcite . hence , since the equation of killing admit less than @xmath25 independent solutions , by lemma [ 3 ] , there are less than @xmath25 transformations that preserve the variational problem .",
    "the remark above concludes the proof .    from the previous theorem",
    "we easily obtain the following    if the only solution of the killing s equations is @xmath26 , the corresponding geodesic flow is not analytically integrable .",
    "we now want to consider some more properties of the infinitesimal isometries .",
    "a classical result @xcite is the following    the lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries @xmath20 of a connected riemannian manifold @xmath0 is of dimension at most @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , then @xmath0 is a space of constant curvature .",
    "this proposition gives the maximum number of infinitesimal isometries and hence also the maximum number of first integrals for a geodesic flow on a manifold of dimension @xmath7 .",
    "in particular in the two dimensional case we have    if @xmath0 is a two dimensional connected riemannian manifold of non constant curvature then the lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries @xmath20 is of dimension at most @xmath30 . [ 4 ]    one example that illustrates the results above is the kepler problem on the plane .",
    "such problem can be described as the geodesic flow on a sphere @xmath31 , hence the isometries form a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath32 , and there are three first integrals other than the hamiltonian ( one component of the angular momentum and two components of the runge - lenz vector ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider , for instance , an homogeneous potential , other than the harmonic oscillator and the kepler one , we can describe the motion only as a geodesic flow on a surface that has a @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian function for the anisotropic kepler problem on the plane can be written as    h(*q*,*p*)=*p*^2 2-a ( q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2)^1/2 [ anisotropic ] where @xmath34 is a constant and @xmath35 is the position of one body with respect to the other , considered fixed at the origin of the coordinate system , and @xmath36 is the momentum of the moving particle .",
    "the constant measures the strength of the anisotropy and for @xmath37 we recover the classical kepler problem .    with some canonical transformations we want to write the problem as the geodesic flow on a surface .",
    "to accomplish this task we need the following lemma    let @xmath38 be a solution of the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian @xmath39 which lies on the level surface @xmath40 .",
    "let us change the time variable @xmath41 to @xmath42 along this trajectory according to the formula @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 is a solution of the hamiltonian system ( with respect to the same symplectic structure ) with hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 with @xmath47 , one can also put @xmath48 .",
    "[ 1 ]    the statement above can be found in @xcite and the proof is based on the idea of extended phase space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we perform the change of time @xmath49 on the submanifold @xmath50 , according to lemma [ 1 ] , we obtain the new hamiltonian    ( q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2)^1/2(h - h)=(q_1 ^",
    "2+q_2 ^ 2)^1/2(*p*^2 - 2h 2 ) -a .",
    "then again change the time @xmath42 to @xmath51 by @xmath52 on the same level surface @xmath50 . by the second part of lemma [ 1 ]",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian h=(q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2)(*p*^2 - 2h)^2 4 .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] finally , applying legendre s transformation , regarding @xmath53 as coordinates and @xmath54 as the canonically conjugate momenta , we can write    \\ {    l p_1=h q_1=q_1 2(*p*^2 - 2h)^2 + p_2=h q_2=q_2 2(*p*^2 - 2h)^2    . where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "consequently    \\ {    l q_1=2p_1(*p*^2 - 2h)^2 + q_2=2p_2(*p*^2 - 2h)^2    . .",
    "moreover since we have that = p_1q_1(*p*,p_1)+p_2q_2(*p*,p_2)-h(q_1(*p * , p_1),q_2(*p * , p_2),p_1,p_2 ) = we obtain a natural lagrangian system with lagrangian = 1 ( * p*^2 - 2h)^2(p_1^2+p_2^2 ) and if we let @xmath55 and @xmath56 we obtain = 1 2 g_ijx^ix^j [ lagrangian ] where g_ij=2 ( x^2+y^2 - 2h)^2 (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & 1/    ) . [ metric ]",
    "the lagrangian above defines a riemann metric of gaussian curvature given by k=",
    "-(1-)(x^2-y^2)-2h(1 + ) [ curvature ] that for @xmath37 describes a metric of constant gaussian curvature ( positive for @xmath57 and negative for @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , by corollary 2 , for @xmath59 we have at most one infinitesimal isometry ( and hence also at most one first integral ) , since the curvature is not constant .",
    "in the previous section we reduced the anisotropic kepler problem to a geodesic flow on a two dimensional surface , and hence we can apply the results obtained in section 2 .",
    "this section is devoted to prove the nonintegrability of such system .",
    "thus we are well on our way to proving the following    the anisotropic kepler problem is not analytically integrable , i.e. it does not have any analytic first integral independent of the hamiltonian .    the only fact that remains to be proved is that the killing s equations does nt have any non - null solution . the equations of killing for the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be written as \\ {    c ^1 y+ 1 ^2 x=0 + -4(x^1+y^2 ) ( x^2+y^2 - 2h)+2 ^ 1 x=0 + -4(x^1+y^2 ) ( x^2+y^2 - 2h)+2 ^ 2 y=0    . [ system ] subtracting the third equation from the second we get = ^2y , [ partials ] combining ( [ partials ] ) with the first equation in system ( [ system ] ) we obtain    = - , = -1 ^2 ^2 x^2 .",
    "[ secondpartials ]    now multiplying the second equation in system ( [ system ] ) by @xmath60 ( assume @xmath57 ) , differentiating with respect to @xmath61 and using equation ( [ partials ] ) and the first relation in ( [ system ] ) we get the following second order differential equation    2(x^2+y^2 -2h)^2 ^1 y^2 - 4y^1 y+4 ^ 1=0 .",
    "[ eq1 ] similarly from the third equation in ( [ system ] ) we get another second order differential equation    ( x^2+y^2 -2h)^2 ^2 x^2 - 4 x^2 x+4 ^ 2=0 . [ eq2 ] it is easy to see that if @xmath57 , @xmath62 is an ordinary point since the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are analytical in @xmath65 at @xmath62 .",
    "let each of these functions be represented by its taylor series at @xmath62 on the real line , then every solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) on @xmath66 is analytic at @xmath62 and can be represented on @xmath66 by its taylor series at @xmath62 .",
    "similarly every solution of ( [ eq2 ] ) can be represented on @xmath66 by its taylor series at @xmath67 since @xmath67 is an ordinary point .",
    "therefore we can look for solutions of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) of the form @xmath68 and solutions of ( [ eq2 ] ) of the form @xmath69 .",
    "routine calculations show that , from ( [ eq1 ] ) we must have    a_2=-a_0 ( x^2 - 2h ) , a_3=(-1)a_1 3(x^2 - 2h ) [ a_2 ] and the following recurrence relation a_n+2=- 2 + n(n-3 ) ( x^2 - 2h)(n+2)(n+1 ) a_n holds for @xmath70 . from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we get b_2=-b_0 ( y^2 - 2h ) , b_3=-(-1 ) b_1 3(y^2 - 2h ) and the recurrence relation b_n+2=- 2 + n(n-3 ) ( y^2 - 2h)(n+2)(n+1 ) b_n for @xmath70 . with the preparations above we",

    "now we need to check that the solutions we found above satisfy the `` consistency '' relations ( [ secondpartials ] ) .",
