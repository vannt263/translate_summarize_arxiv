    "one of the current issues in theoretical physics is the difficult to understand gravitational interactions at large scales .",
    "for instance , the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite can not be explained in general relativity ( gr ) unless the existence of a cosmic fluid having exotic properties is postulated , the _ dark energy _ , or introducing a cosmological constant which , in turn , brings about other problems , concerning its nature and origin @xcite .",
    "similarly , the rotation curves of spiral galaxies seem to escape the current gravity paradigms : to reconcile the theoretical models with the observations , the existence of a peculiar form of matter is required , the _ dark matter _ , which is supposed to be a cold and pressureless medium , whose distribution is that of a spherical halo around the galaxies@xcite .    even though in the last 100 years gr has undergone brilliant successes in explaining and discovering the features of the gravitational interactions in the world around us ( a comprehensive overview about the tests of gr in the last 100 years can be found in the recent paper by clifford m. will @xcite ) ,",
    "the reliability of einstein theory and its principles are questioned when observations on large cosmological scales are confronted with the theoretical predictions or , also , when the issue of quantization of gravity is considered .",
    "the quest for a more fundamental theory of gravity is open : this new theory must be capable of describing gravitational interactions at all scales ; moreover , since gr is in excellent agreement with the observations at small scales , any new theory of gravity should lead to einstein theory in some suitable limit . in the recent paper @xcite a review of the motivations to consider extensions of gr can be found , together with a discussion of some modified theories of gravity .",
    "a possible approach toward a new theory of gravity consists in extending gr on a purely geometric basis : theories of gravity having a richer geometric structure have been proposed , such as the @xmath5 theories , where the gravitational lagrangian depends on a function @xmath6 of the curvature scalar @xmath7 ( see @xcite and references therein ) : when @xmath8 the action reduces to the usual einstein - hilbert action , and einstein s theory is obtained .",
    "another approach stems from a generalization of teleparallel gravity ( tegr ) @xcite : the latter is based on a riemann - cartan space - time , endowed with the nonsymmetric weitzenbck connection which , unlike the levi - civita connection of gr , gives rise to torsion but it is curvature - free . in tegr",
    "torsion plays the role of curvature , while the tetrads field plays the role of the dynamical field instead of the metric field ; the field equations are obtained from a lagrangian containing the torsion scalar @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that einstein himself studied a theory of gravity with torsion , in his attempt to formulate a unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "even though the two theories have a different geometric structure , gr and tegr share the same dynamics : this means that every solution of gr is also solution of tegr . in the so called @xmath0 theories ,",
    "the gravitational lagrangian is an analytic function of the torsion scalar @xmath9 , so they generalize tegr just as the @xmath5 theories do for gr .",
    "these theories are appealing because they are not equivalent to gr @xcite and , as a consequence , they can be considered as potential candidates to solve the issue of cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "various aspects of @xmath0 gravity have been considered , such as , for instance , exact solutions and stellar models @xcite .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions in @xmath0 gravity are important also because these solutions , describing the gravitational field of pointlike sources , can be used to constrain these theories with planetary motions in the solar system . a weak - field solution , suitable to model the gravitational interaction in the solar system ,",
    "was obtained by iorio and saridakis ( is ) @xcite for a lagrangian in the form @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is a small constant which parametrizes the departure from gr : this solution was used to constrain the @xmath2 parameter in the solar system @xcite .",
    "indeed , the additional degrees of freedom of @xmath0 gravity are related to the fact that the equations of motion are not invariant under local lorentz transformations @xcite ( see however the recent papers @xcite where the possibility of obtaining a fully covariant reformulation of @xmath0 gravity has been analyzed ) . in particular , this implies the existence of a preferential global reference frame defined by the autoparallel curves of the manifold that solve the equations of motion .",
    "consequently , even though the symmetry can help in choosing suitable coordinates to write the metric in a simple way , this does not give any hint on the form of the tetrad .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a diagonal tetrad is not a good choice to properly parallelize the spacetime both in the context of non flat homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies ( friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker universes ) and in spherically symmetric space - times ( schwarzschild or schwarzschild - de sitter solutions ) : actually , the is solution was obtained using a diagonal tetrad , hence it suffers from these theoretical conundrums . in a subsequent paper ruggiero and radicella ( rr )",
    "@xcite obtained a new solution for lagrangian in the general form @xmath11 , with @xmath3 , following the approach described in @xcite , which does not constrain the functional form of the lagrangian . a preliminary analysis of the impact of the rr solution on the solar system dynamics",
    "was carried out in @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the application of this spherically symmetric spacetime solution to the four solar system tests of gr : perihelion precession , light bending , shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift . by doing so",
    ", we investigate the effect of the @xmath2 parameter to these tests , and by using observational data , constraints on this parameter are set .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a brief description of the field equations and solutions for @xmath0 gravity with a non diagonal tetrad is given , followed by the applications for solar system tests being , perihelion precession ( sec .",

    "finally , a discussion of the results and constraints on the parameter @xmath2 is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the foundations of @xmath0 gravity and obtain the field equations , then , we solve the field equations in spherically symmetry and weak - field approximation , in order to obtain the rr solution . in @xmath0 gravity the tetrads play the role of the dynamical field instead of the metric : given a coordinate basis , the components @xmath12 of the tetrads are related to the metric tensor @xmath13 by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "we point out that , in our notation , latin indexes refer to the tangent space , while greek indexes label coordinates on the manifold , and we set units such that @xmath16 .",
    "the field equations can be obtained by varying the action @xmath17    with respect to the tetrads , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the action for the matter fields . in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) , @xmath6 is a differentiable function of the torsion scalar @xmath9 : in particular , if @xmath20 , the action is the same as in tegr , and the theory is equivalent to gr .",
    "starting from the tetrads , it is possible to define the torsion tensor , t^ _   = e^_a ( _ e^a_- _ e^a _ ) ,   [ eq : deftorsiont ] and the superpotential tensor s^ _   = ( t^ _   - t_^  + t_^   ) + ^_t_^   - ^_t_^  , [ eq : defsuperpotential ] from which it is possible to obtain the torsion scalar t = s^ _   t_^  .",

    "we are interested in spherically symmetric solutions that can be used to describe the gravitational field of a pointlike source , e.g. of the sun . to this end",

    "clearly discussed in @xcite , a diagonal tetrad that gives back the metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric - ansatz ] ) is not a good choice since the equations of motion for such a choice would constrain _ a priori _ the form of the lagrangian .",
    "this is related to the lack of the local lorentz invariance of @xmath0 gravity : tetrads connected by local lorentz transformations lead to the same metric - i.e. the same causal structure - but different equations of motions , thus physically inequivalent solutions .",
    "consequently , we obtain the following field equations :    @xmath25+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2rf_{tt}t'\\left(2 + 2e^{b(r)/2}+ra'(r)\\right)=0 , \\label{eq31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 are the energy density and pressure of the matter energy - momentum tensor ; the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath27 .",

    "here we consider the weak - field solutions with nonconstant torsion scalar , i.e. @xmath31 , and we are interested in constraining these solutions by means of solar system tests : so , we can safely suppose that these solutions are perturbations of a flat background minkowski space - time . as a consequence",
    ", we write @xmath32 for the metric coefficients . furthermore ,",
    "in solving the field equations ( [ 00eq1])-([eq31 ] ) we confine ourselves to linear perturbations , and consider @xmath0 in the form @xmath33 , where @xmath2 is a small constant , parametrizing the departure of these theories from @xmath34 , and @xmath3 .    on looking for solutions of the equations ( [ 00eq1])-([eq31 ] ) with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , which corresponds to a cosmological constant , we obtain the following general expressions a(r)=--2 ^ 3n-1 -1 3 r^2 , [ eq : solakn ] b(r)=+ 2 ^ 3n-1 ( -3n+1 + 2n^2 ) + 1 3 r^2 , [ eq : solbkn ] where we set @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the cosmological constant .",
    "notice that , on setting @xmath39 , we obtain a weak - field schwarzschild - de sitter solution perturbed by terms that are proportional to @xmath2 and decay with a power of the radial coordinate .",

    "it is interesting to point out that our linearized approach can be applied to arbitrary polynomial corrections to the torsion scalar . in other words ,",
    "a general lagrangian can be written in the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 can be seen as a perturbation of the tegr - gr lagrangian @xmath20 . as a consequence , by writing the arbitrary function @xmath45 as a suitable power series , it is possible to evaluate its impact as a perturbation of the weak - field spherically symmetric solution in gr : the @xmath46th term of the series gives a contribution proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the case with @xmath48 , corresponding to the lagrangian @xmath10 is interesting since every general lagrangian reduces to this form , in first approximation .",
    "our vacuum ( @xmath49 ) solution for @xmath48 , turns out to be a(r)=-32- , [ eq : sola ] b(r ) = 96 + .",
    "[ eq : solb ] our results can be compared to the is solution @xcite , where a lagrangian in the form @xmath10 was considered .",
    "while to lowest order approximation in both cases the perturbations are proportional to @xmath50 , the numerical coefficients are different : this is not surprising , since the is solution was obtained by solving different field equations using a diagonal tetrad .",
    "consider the metric eq . , and consider the equatorial plane @xmath51 . for timelike orbits , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the proper time , and hence the metric reduces to @xmath54",
    "since teleparallel gravity expresses the gravitational field through torsional stresses , geodesics do not exist in a real sense .",
    "instead , we have force equations analogous to the lorentz equation of electrodynamics , in which for spinless particles is given by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the contortion tensor defined to be , @xmath57    through the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([force_eq ] ) the torsion plays the role of gravitational force . from the definition of the contortion tensor ,",
    "the geodesic equation of gr can be derived , @xmath58    however , keeping in mind that both the geodesic equation and the forcelike equation share a common source , the final trajectories will be the same thus giving the equivalence between general relativity and teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "for this reason , using the geodesic equation instead , from the time @xmath59 and @xmath60 components ( i.e. @xmath61 ) , the following constants of motion are obtained , @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the energy per unit mass and @xmath64 is the angular momentum per unit mass of the particle .",
    "it is important to note that this equivalence only exists when the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) holds . for the case in which the wep does not hold , the force equations of teleparallel gravity change , depending on the inertial mass and gravitational mass of the particle , effectively changing the equations to depend on the properties of the test particle itself",
    "this however is consistent within the context of teleparallelism , whilst this is not true with regards to gr .",
    "since the weak - field limit is considered ( @xmath65 ) , the wep will be assumed to hold @xcite .    substituting these conserved quantities in eq .",
