    "linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) @xcite deals with the dynamics of cracks in elastic materials subject to the assumption that linear elasticity if applicable everywhere in the material except for a very small region around the crack tip known as the process zone .",
    "while recent experiments and theories indicate that there exist examples where nonlinear elasticity may be important for a full characterization of the stress field before a dynamical crack , some exact results of lefm continue to have a very important role in describing and understanding the dynamics of cracks in a variety of fracture contexts .",
    "indeed , one of the most celebrated results of lefm is the analytic description of the universal stress distribution in front of a crack .",
    "this analytic result is particularly simple when the crack is developing under one of the three fundamental shearing modes that a material can suffer .",
    "the simplest form results from mode iii cracking which is obtained under an out - of - plane shear tearing . in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 coincide with the crack tip and @xmath4 with the crack faces , the stress in front of a crack takes on the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the so - called  stress intensity factor \" . the results ( [ regular ] ) underlines the universality of the angular dependence and of the square - root singularity of the stress at the crack tip @xcite .",
    "all the non - universal aspects of the stress distribution are collected in the stress intensity factor which depends on everything , including the crack length , the boundary conditions and the history of the loads that drive the crack evolution .",
    "the value of the stress intensity factor determines whether the crack propagates or not ; irwin @xcite established a relationship between the energy release rate and the stress intensity factor for a crack growth .",
    "a crack propagates as long as the energy release rate into the crack tip balance the dissipation involved in the crack propagation , i.e. the griffith criterion @xcite .",
    "solving for mode iii is relatively easy since the fundamental equation to be dealt with is the laplace equation @xcite rather than the bi - lapalace equation which is the relevant one for modes i and ii . on the other hand in 3-dimensional materials",
    "mode iii is unstable and attempts to break in this mode quickly turn to cracks developing under effective modes i or ii .",
    "this is not the case for thin plates where mode iii can be sustained in experiments as had been demonstrated recently in ref .",
    "the theory of thin plates is however more cumbersome , using again the bi - laplace operator even for mode iii cracks .",
    "nevertheless the problem can be treated analytically @xcite with the result that the leading singularity at the crack tip is higher , going like @xmath7 . in this case , the shear force close to the crack tip can be written as @xmath8 we assign tilde on @xmath6 to distinguish it from the known stress intensity factor for this mode .",
    "@xmath9 is the thickness of the plate .",
    "we may mention that the kirchhoff plate theory predicts the stresses very accurately for small deflection and at some distance from the crack tip @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , for large deflection or near the crack tip @xmath11 , the singularity of the stress field weakens @xcite , and therefore it may diverge from the actual results .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present further analytic progress that culminates in the calculation of the stress intensity factor for cracks developing in thin sheets .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ setup ] we set up the problem for mathematical analysis . in sect .",
    "[ bc ] we study the properties of the analytic functions that need to be solved for and the boundary conditions . in sect .",
    "[ conformal ] we introduce the conformal map from the strip to the upper half plane which is used to advantage in simplifying the solution of the problem . sect .",
    "[ sif ] wraps up the problem and presents the analytic result for the stress intensity factor .",
    "consider a semi - infinite strip of a thin sheet with a cut in the in the middle of the left - most end of the strip , along the symmetry axis .",
    "the left boundary is subjected to anti - symmetric shear load @xmath12 , i.e. mode iii configuration , cf .",
    "[ sheet ] . for small deflection",
    ", we can neglect the in - plane deformation of the middle surface . according to the kirchhoff plate theory @xcite , the deflection @xmath13 in the @xmath2-axis for pure",
    "bending becomes @xmath14 where the operator ` delta ' stands for the laplace operator @xmath15 ; the bending moments and the twisting moment are @xmath16 and the anti - plane shear stress @xmath17 where the sheet is on the @xmath18 plane , and the bending occurs along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "@xmath19 is a component of the stress tensor , @xmath20 is the so - called _ the flexural rigidity _ of a plate , @xmath9 is the thickness of the plate , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the young s modulus and poisson s ratio , respectively .    , and a cut ( c - d ) of length @xmath23 in the middle of the strip .",
    "the upper left side of the strip ( b - c ) is subjected to an anti - plane positive load , and the lower left side to an identical but negative load . ]",
    "introduce now the complex notation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , such that @xmath26    since @xmath13 is a solution of the bi - laplace equation , @xmath13 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes  the real part \" , and @xmath29 are both analytic functions , accept maybe on the boundary .",

    "\\\\ m_y\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!-d\\left[\\!-\\!(1\\!-\\nu)\\re\\left(\\bar z\\varphi''\\!+\\!\\chi''\\right)+2(1+\\nu)\\re\\left(\\varphi'\\right)\\right],\\\\ m_{xy}\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!d(1-\\nu)\\im\\left(\\bar z\\varphi''+\\chi''\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    summing over the two bending moments gives @xmath32 and the complex representation of the shear force becomes @xmath33    next , the shear force exerted normal to the boundary is @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the normal and the tangent direction oriented with respect to each other as the axes @xmath36 .",
    "multiply the last equation by @xmath37 and using the complex representation in eq . gives @xmath38",
    "in the case of mode iii symmetry , the load and the deflection are anti - symmetric with respect to the @xmath40 axis , ( cf . fig . [ sheet ] . )",
    "we consider only one crack lying on part of the @xmath40 axis ( c - d ) .",
    "the upper ( b - c ) and the lower left edges are displaced with a constant distance from each other , in a direction perpendicular to the strip plane .",
    "then , @xmath13 is anti - symmetric , but also @xmath41 $ ] is anti - symmetric .",
    "this implies that @xmath42=-\\re[\\varphi'(\\bar z)]\\ ] ] the left and the right members give @xmath43 which may be arranged to @xmath44    now , if @xmath45 is analytic on both the upper and the lower half plane , though not necessary on the boundary , the function @xmath46 is also analytic on the same domain .",
    "thus the left side of eq .",
    "is analytic in the whole domain ( excluding the boundary ) .",
    "since it equals to minus its complex conjugate , it must be a pure imaginary function .",
    "however , according to the cauchy- riemann equations , an imaginary analytic function is a constant .",
    "thus , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a real number .",
    "taking the complex conjugate of this expression , followed by the complex conjugation of @xmath2 , gives @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the anti - symmetry with respect to the @xmath40 axis prevails @xmath50    since @xmath51 is not necessary analytic on the @xmath40 axis and on the boundary , it is advantageous to separate notations , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for its parts on the upper and lower half - planes , respectively .      in the case of a symmetric body with an anti - symmetric loading , it can be assumed that @xmath54 on the symmetry axis ahead of the crack ( d - e ) .",
    "moreover , the anti - symmetry of @xmath13 dictates that @xmath55 . from eqs . and @xmath56=\\varphi'(x+i0 )",

    "the crack face ( c - d ) is assumed to be traction free .",
    "thus , the stress components acting normal to the crack s face become zero .",
    "this condition gives @xmath59    integrating eq . along the boundary from a point @xmath40 on the crack face to end of the strip , i.e. point @xmath60 ,",

    "these boundary conditions annul also @xmath71 , and by the same consideration of sec .",
