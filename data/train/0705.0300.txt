    "in the past few years , considerable attention has been paid to the so - called nonextensive statistics , both from theoretical and observational viewpoints .",
    "the nonextensive framework , first developed by tsallis @xcite , seems to present a consistent theoretical tool to investigate complex systems in their nonequilibrium stationary states .",
    "recently , several consequences ( in different branches ) of the tsallis framework have been investigated in the literature @xcite , which includes systems of interest in high energy physics . in this regard ,",
    "the very first application was addressed to a problem of solar neutrino @xcite . in this study , the authors applied the @xmath0-framework to derive a distribution function for the interior plasma , which is relevant in the calculation of the nuclear fusion reaction rates responsible for the neutrino flux emitted by sun . recently , within fokker - planck dynamics , the einstein s relation between drag , diffusion , and the equilibrium distribution for a spatially homogeneous system have been generalized in the context of tsallis statistics , and such a model was applied to charm quark dynamics in a thermal quark - gluon plasma for the case of collisional equilibration @xcite .",
    "more recently , interpretations for central au - au collisions at rhic energies in a relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) for multiparticle interactions based on the interplay of nonequilibrium and local equilibrium were studied also through extensive and nonextensive statistics @xcite .    in the theoretical treatment of the properties of nuclear matter ,",
    "the relativistic phenomenological approach developed by walecka @xcite ( the so - called quantum hadrodynamics [ qhd - i ] ) , represents one of the important approaches to the highly nonlinear behavior of strong interactions at the hadronic energy scales .",
    "this model provides a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for the description of bulk static properties of strong interacting many - body nuclear systems .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effects of the nonextensive statistical mehanics on the qhd - i theory by considering a @xmath0-generalization of the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distributions . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth emphazing that earlier generalizations of quantum statistics for fermions and bosons have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied in the context of relativistic nuclear equation of state ( eos ) of boguta - bodmer @xcite by drago et al @xcite .",
    "however , in the present work , to study the nonextensive effects on the qhd - i theory we use the most recent fermion distribution obtained by tweldeberhan , plastino and miller in ref .",
    "@xcite ( tpm distribution ) .",

    "@xcite are recovered .",
    "4 .   as @xmath59 for any vaue of @xmath62 , an equation of state similar to that of a black body",

    ".5 in    in order to study the nonextensive effects on qhd - i theory , we have calculated numerically , for several values of temperatures and of the parameter @xmath0 , the effective nucleon mass , the vector and scalar mesons fields for pure neutron matter ( @xmath20 ) , as well as the eos for symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath21 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the nonextensive effects on the effective mass and vector meson for a pure neutron matter . in panel",
    "( a ) , for @xmath69 , we note that the higher the parameter @xmath0 , the smaller the effective mass @xmath9 ( and , consequently , the higher the scalar field @xmath6 , since @xmath70 ) .",
    "such an effect may be physically understood in that at a given temperature , the scalar density , as source for the scalar mesons , increases with the increasing of the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the attraction of the nucleons , mediated by the scalar mesons , becomes stronger , reducing the effective mass .",
    "the behaviour of vector meson field @xmath71 is shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the nonextensive effect on the symetric nuclear matter eos .",
    "the panels display the @xmath72 plane for selected values of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are ploted for arbitrarily chosen values of temperature , @xmath7315 mev , 20 mev , and 30 mev . in reality , the motivation for this choice is of astrophysical interest in the study of protoneutron stars .",
    "clearly , the nonextensive effect is manifested in the increasing of the pressure with the values of @xmath0 becoming the eos stiffer .",
    "another interesting effect of the nonextensivity on nuclear eos of qhd - i concerns the phase transitions . from panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that the first order phase transition may be eliminated by the variation of the parameter @xmath0",
    ". this fact can be easily visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , where isotherms at @xmath74 mev are plotted for several values of @xmath75 .",
    "note that , for increasing values of @xmath0 , the dip in the region of thermodynamical instability becomes smaller , vanishing at the turning point that defines the critical values of thermodynamical quantities ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , etc . ) .",
    "we also note that for our choice @xmath74 mev the upper value of @xmath0 ( near the 5/4 limit discussed earlier ) is not sufficient to eliminate the first order phase transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transitions can be eliminated for values of @xmath64 in the region @xmath78 . in this interval",
    ", all temperatures can be made critical .",
    "this amounts to say that a ( critical ) parameter @xmath79 can be determined in order to yield a turning point in the isotherm at a given temperature .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) where several isotherms are displayed . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) values of @xmath79 are plotted as function of temperature in the above range ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the smooth behavior of @xmath79 allows a parametrization of the form @xmath81",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the nonextensive effects on the mean field theory of walecka ( qhd - i ) @xcite .",
    "we have used , instead of the standard fermi - dirac nucleon and antinucleon distribution functions , the @xmath0-quantum distribution recently obtained by teweldeberhan , plastino and miller in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has a new cut - off prescription based on the extremization of a thermodynamical functional .",
    "we emphasize that the nonextensive effects on nuclear and pure neutron matter , for a considerable range of temperature , is to make the equation of state stiffer and to increase the intensity of the vector and scalar meson fields , with a consequent lowering of the nucleon effective mass ( for increasing values of the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 ) .",
    "we believe that it may have interesting consequencies in astrophysical studies , mainly in what concerns the calculation of masses of compact objects , such as protoneutron stars .    as discussed in sec .",
    "v , another interesting feature of nonextensivity is that , at temperatures in the range @xmath80 , phase transitions of first order can be avoided by a convenient variation of the parameter @xmath0 , which allows the determination of a critical @xmath79 parameter at the turning point of an isotherm at a given @xmath64 [ eq . ( [ qc ] ) ] .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the estimates for the nonextensive parameter from the _ generalized _ walecka many - body field theory is consistent with the upper limit @xmath82 , obtained from several independent studies in the quantum @xcite and in the non quantum limit @xcite involving the tsallis nonextensive framework .",
