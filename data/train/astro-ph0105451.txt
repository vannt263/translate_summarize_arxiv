    "the integrated radio continuum spectra of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) are generally power - law from meter to centimeter wavelengths and shorter , with a continuum of spectral indices ranging from @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) for shell - type remnants to @xmath4 for plerions , with many presenting blended emission at intermediate indices . however , below  100  mhz , roughly two - thirds of snrs show spectral turnovers indicative of thermal absorption ( * ? ? ?",

    "the inferred continuum optical depths and the poor correlation between the presence of a turnover and the , albeit poorly constrained , distance to a snr are inconsistent with absorption arising in the ( globally - distributed ) warm ionized medium ( wim , @xmath5  @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",

    ", the absorption must arise from localized ionized regions having an enhanced density ( @xmath7  @xmath6 ) but of unknown scale size and with a small ( @xmath8% ) filling factor @xcite .",
    "the favored interpretation has been that the absorbers represent extended region envelopes ( ehes ) , ionized gas surrounding normal regions , as postulated by @xcite from comparison of centimeter- and meter - wavelength radio recombination line ( rrl ) observations .",
    "alternatively , the absorption could be caused by the superposition of many small , normal regions or planetary nebulae along the line of site .",
    "until now , low - frequency observations have had insufficient resolution to resolve spatially the morphology of the absorption and thereby constrain the geometry and scale size of the absorber .",
    "we distinguish between the free - free absorption responsible for low - frequency turnovers and the _ intrinsic _ thermal absorption now documented in two galactic snrs ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ) .",
    "in these two snrs , the free - free optical depths in their interiors are far smaller than the levels considered here , and the radio absorption can be linked to thermal material seen at other wavelengths , e.g. , optical filaments in the crab nebula .    the supernova remnant ( ) is the nonthermal component of the complex and is approximately 12  from the region .",
    "it is a relatively young ( @xmath9  yr , @xcite ) , bright ( @xmath10  jy at  1  ghz ) , and reasonably extended ( @xmath11 ) shell - type . as such it has been a common target for testing the predictions of shock acceleration theory against the energy spectrum of the relativistic electrons inferred from spectral index studies above  100  mhz @xcite .",

    "the filtered and amplified signals are then passed to the regular vla if chain .",
    "the vla if chain can handle four simultaneous ifs .",
    "two of these are utilized by the right- and left - circularly polarized signals at  74  mhz .",
    "the system was designed so that the remaining two ifs may also carry signals at  327  mhz . in this case , the simultaneous 3  mhz bandwidth 327  mhz data were acquired in the event that dual - frequency ionospheric phase referencing ( dfipr , * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , at  74  mhz ( figure  [ fig:74 ] ) the morphology is reversed , with the eastern portion brightest , and the emission toward the southwest dramatically suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig:74 ] suggests strongly that we have resolved spatially the thermal absorption inferred previously from the low - frequency turnover in the continuum spectrum and from rrls detected toward . in this section ,",
    "we first demonstrate that the 74  mhz flux density we measure is consistent with the degree of absorption inferred from the integrated continuum spectrum .",
    "we then argue that this level of absorption and its morphology favor an extrinsic ism absorber .",
    "finally , we address the scale size constrained by the spatially - resolved structure in the absorber toward .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum of the total remnant and compares our flux density measurements to those published previously .",
    "the data for the spectrum of the remnant are taken from @xcite , as is the fit to those data .",
    "the expected 74  mhz flux density from @xcite s  ( @xcite ) spectral fit ( 66  jy ) exceeds the value we measure ( 55  jy ) by 20% .",
    "we do not consider this discrepancy to be significant .",
    "first , the lowest frequency flux densities compiled by @xcite were often plagued by confusion , resulting from the poor angular resolution , and therefore tend to overestimate the flux densities of snrs .",
    "variations at the levels of the uncertainties in the spectral fits ( @xmath18 in spectral index and @xmath19% in optical depth ) can account for the discrepancy between expected and observed flux densities .",
    "second , some of the discrepancy may result from being partially resolved out by our a - configuration 74  mhz observations .",
    "even so , this would not affect our general conclusions : there is considerable asymmetry in the structure of at  74  mhz , an asymmetry that differs substantially from what is seen at higher frequencies .",
    "moreover , b - configuration observations obtained recently show a similar east - west asymmetry of the 74  mhz emission , albeit at lower resolution ( perley  2000 , private communication ) , giving us further confidence that resolution effects are not the dominant cause of the low - frequency asymmetry .",
    "we therefore consider our 74 mhz integrated flux density consistent with previous work , although the optical depths we present here could be considered conservatively as upper limits .",
    "our multi - configuration observations at  327  mhz means that resolution effects do not affect these data .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] also shows the spectra for the eastern and western halves of .",

    "these uncertainties do not take into account various systematic effects , e.g. , the amount of flux resolved out by the interferometer , so should be viewed conservatively as lower limits to the actual uncertainties .",
    "a division into only eastern and western halves of the remnant is clearly a crude measure of the morphology .",
    "nonetheless , it will serve our purpose of demonstrating a link between the morphology and spectrum , and it will suffice for obtaining an estimate of the amount of absorption along the line of sight ( see below ) .    following @xcite we fit the spectra for the eastern and western halves of the remnant to the functional form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the flux density and free - free optical depth , respectively , at the fiducial frequency of  408  mhz .",

    "the value for  @xmath31 is likely to be an overestimate .",

    "intrinsic thermal absorption at low radio frequencies has been detected toward two young galactic snrs , but we do not favor this scenario as an explanation for the low - frequency absorption toward . in @xcite the morphology of the absorption",
    "is centrally condensed , consistent with the presumed location of unshocked ejecta interior to the reverse shock . moreover , the magnitude of the absorption ( @xmath35 ) is much less than what we observe toward the western side of .",
    "the observed absorption in the @xcite is not centrally condensed but has been linked to one of the largest thermal filaments at the foreground periphery of the remnant .",

    "this hot gas is unlikely to contribute to any appreciable free - free absorption at our observing frequencies . using the parameters they derive for the hot gas ( @xmath37  k , @xmath38  @xmath6 , @xmath39  pc )",
    ", we find an optical depth of @xmath40 at  74  mhz .",
    "we consider both the asymmetry and magnitude of the observed absorption toward to be evidence in favor of extrinsic thermal absorption , in agreement with conclusions drawn from earlier low frequency measurements .",
    "since is a young snr , we can not rule out that unshocked ejecta near the center of the remnant may be contributing to the absorption , but it is unlikely to dominate .",
    "the gross appearance of the 74  mhz image ( figure  [ fig:74 ] ) and the analysis of  [ sec : spectrum ] suggests that the absorber toward is a discrete structure covering mainly the western half of the source with a scale size of a few arcminutes .",
    "we now use figures  [ fig:74 ] and  [ fig:327 ] to assess the existence of smaller scale absorption structures as well .    assuming that the high - frequency spectrum can be extrapolated to  74  mhz and that there are no intrinsic spatial variations in the radio spectrum of the remnant between  74 and  327  mhz , we used the 327  mhz image to produce an expected 74  mhz image  @xmath41 . in combination with the observed 74  mhz image  @xmath42",

    "although the signal - to - noise level is low in the region of maximum em and optical depth ( typically 3@xmath46 ) , figure",
    "[ fig : em ] clearly shows that there are small scale variations in em across the face of the remnant .",
    "the typical scale size of the variations appears to be comparable to or smaller than our beam , indicating that the absorber has em variations at least as small as 25  ( 1.2  pc at  10  kpc ) .",
    "extended hydrogen envelopes ( ehes ) were postulated by @xcite , primarily to explain various rrl observations ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "assuming that the rrls and the free - free absorption arise from the same gas , they constrained the ionized gas to have an electron density  @xmath49  @xmath6 and temperature  @xmath50@xmath34  . in order to make these determinations",
    ", @xcite had to make an assumption about the radial extent of the ionized region .",
    "they argued that the transverse extent of the region is roughly 15 , equivalent to a linear extent of  45  pc at a distance of  10  kpc , and so that plausible values for the radial extent were 10  pc1  kpc , leading to the values quoted .",
    "our observations show that the absorption across the western face of has a mean value of @xmath51 and can be explained by a thermal cloud of size of a few arcminutes ( 10  pc at  10  kpc ) with @xmath32 .",

    "therefore , the somewhat smaller value of @xmath53 employed by @xcite does not change their conclusions substantively and can be accommodated by a slightly higher value for  @xmath55 or slightly lower value for  @xmath33 or both .",
    "furthermore , the few arcminute scale size constrained from our observations is within a factor of a few of their estimate of 15  for the size of the ionized region .",

    "figure  [ fig:327 ] shows that s morphology at  327  mhz is similar to that seen at higher frequencies .",
    "thus , these em variations must not arise from regions so dense as to cause appreciable free - free absorption at  327  mhz .",

    "first , the regions of lower em represent regions of _ higher _ signal - to - noise ratios than the localized enhancements .",
    "the lower em regions are more significant .",
    "second , the typical size of the localized em enhancements are comparable in size to the synthesized beam while being separated by angular distances comparable to or larger than the synthesized beam .",
    "thus , the regions of lower em represent areas of real , lower absorption as opposed to a resolution effect . if classical , density - bounded regions were in front of but located so close together on the sky that our resolution was just capable of separating them , regions of apparently lower em would exist simply because of spatial averaging by the synthesized beam .",
    "our synthesized beam is small enough and the localized em enhancements are well separated enough that the regions of lower em represent actual absorption .",

    "the gross morphology and integrated spectrum that we obtain are consistent with these analyses , if we include additional absorption from small scale regions as well .",

    "<S> we present sub - arcminute resolution imaging of the galactic supernova remnant at  74  mhz ( 25 ) and  327  mhz ( 6 ) , the former being the lowest frequency at which the source has been resolved . </S>",
    "<S> while the 327  mhz image shows a shell - like morphology similar to that seen at higher frequencies , the 74  mhz image is considerably different , with the southwest region of the remnant almost completely attenuated . </S>",
    "<S> the implied 74  mhz optical depth ( @xmath0 ) is much higher than the intrinsic absorption levels seen inside two other relatively young remnants , cas  a and the crab nebula , nor are natural variations in the relativistic electron energy spectra expected at such levels . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the absorption is also inconsistent with intrinsic absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the absorption to extrinsic free - free absorption by a intervening cloud of thermal electrons . </S>",
    "<S> its presence has already been inferred from the low - frequency turnover in the integrated continuum spectrum and from the detection of radio recombination lines toward the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> our observations confirm the basic conclusions of those measurements , and our observations have resolved the absorber into a complex of classical regions surrounded either partially or fully by low - density gas . </S>",
    "<S> we identify this low - density gas as an extended region envelope ( ehe ) , whose statistical properties were inferred from low resolution meter- and centimeter - wavelength recombination line observations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our radio images with and h@xmath1co observations show that the intervening thermal gas is likely associated with neutral and molecular material as well . </S>",
    "<S> this ehe may be responsible for the enhanced radio - wave scattering seen in the general direction of the complex . </S>"
