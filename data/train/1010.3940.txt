    "measuring strange particle production in proton - proton ( ) collisions is a necessary benchmark for the physics of ultra relativistic heavy ions .",
    "this is important at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , where the heavy - ion programme is scheduled to begin in november 2010  @xcite .",
    "moreover , strangeness in  collisions is interesting in itself , as it may shed light on hadron production mechanisms .",
    "while the _ hard _ component of the event may be described by the perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( based on parton - parton scattering and fragmentation  @xcite ) , the _ soft _ component must be treated in a more complex manner .",
    "currently , the soft physics is described via thermal models  @xcite or via qcd - inspired models ( relying on multi - parton processes  @xcite or multiple scattering  @xcite , for instance ) . in either case ,",
    "further improvements of such phenomenological approaches may be spurred by confrontation with experimental measurements .    in that respect ,",
    "double- and triple - strange baryons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ) , which are the focus of this publication , may provide relevant insights : due to identification via weak - decay topology reconstruction , they can be studied over a large momentum range .",
    "starting from @xmath0  @xmath3 and up to @xmath4 , these spectra cover the region dominated by the soft processes and reach the energy scale where hard scattering mechanisms dominate .",
    "some measurements have already been performed at previous and current facilities .",
    "these include both  collisions ( s@xmath5s , tevatron ) and  collisions ( rhic ) , with centre of mass energies @xmath6 ranging from 0.2  up to 1.96  @xcite .",
    "the lhc , in operation since november 2009 , can extend the existent 0.9-  measurements made by the ua5 collaborations in , and perform new measurements at @xmath6 = 7  , beyond the tevatron energies .",
    "the alice experiment  @xcite is well - suited for such spectrum measurements , due to a low @xmath0  cut - off and excellent particle identification ( pid ) capabilities .",
    "the low @xmath0  cut - off is made possible by the low magnetic field applied in the central barrel ( @xmath7 ) and the low material budget in this mid - rapidity region ( @xmath8 of radiation length  @xcite ) .",
    "the pid capabilities are supplied by a set of detectors utilizing diverse techniques ( energy loss , time of flight , transition radiation , cerenkov effect ) .",
    "the data presented here is from the minimum bias sample collected during the nov - dec 2009 lhc  run at @xmath6 = 0.9  @xcite ( @xmath9 events ) , and from the 7  run that started in march 2010 and is ongoing ( @xmath10 events were analysed here but more than @xmath11 events have been collected since then ) .",
    "this study makes use of the alice central barrel  @xcite , covering a pseudo - rapidity range @xmath12 and the full azimuth , the whole being embedded in the large l3 solenoidal magnet which provides a nominal magnetic field of @xmath13 .",
    "the cascade signals are obtained using essentially data collected by the two main tracking detectors : the inner tracking system ( its ) , composed of 6 cylindrical layers of high - resolution silicon detectors  @xcite , and the cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite .",
    "the multi - strange hadron identification is performed using a combination of displaced - vertex reconstruction , invariant mass analyses as well as single track pid methods , such as energy loss in the tpc .",
    "the reconstruction of the different multi - strange particles hinges on their respective charged weak decays , the so - called _ cascade _ structures . for each particle of interest ,",
    "the main characteristics and utilized decay channels are listed in table [ tab : maincharac ] .",
    "the anti - baryons are similarly reconstructed via the decay channel involving the charge conjugates .",

    "it is checked that the v0 candidate thus obtained sits in the proper invariant mass window to validate the hypothesis . the candidate is then matched with a _",

    "the reconstructed momentum of the multi - strange baryon must point in the direction of the primary vertex .",
    "the v0 vertex and the v0-bachelor matching are limited to a certain fiducial volume .",

    "because of the non - gaussian tails of the signal , this results in rough but sufficient estimates of the signal mean and width .    the background on each side of the signal ( more than @xmath31 away from the gaussian mean ) is then sampled .",

    "the sum of signal and background ( @xmath33+@xmath34 ) is sampled in the region defined by the gaussian mean @xmath35 .",
