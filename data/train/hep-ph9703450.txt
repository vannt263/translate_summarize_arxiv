    "<S> we examine the effect of an anomalous flavor changing chromomagnetic moment which allows direct top quark production ( two partons combining into an unaccompanied single top quark in the s - channel ) at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both t - c - g and t - u - g couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the anomalous charm quark coupling parameter @xmath0 can be measured down to @xmath1(@xmath2 ) at the tevatron with the main injector upgrade(lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous up quark coupling parameter @xmath3 can be measured to @xmath4(@xmath5 ) at the tevatron(lhc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the results quoted in this paper all use the mrsa structure functions . when using the cteq3 m structure functions , the direct top cross section increases by @xmath6 when the charm quark coupling is used , corresponding to a @xmath7 improvement in the discovery limit for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily due to a larger charm quark density in the proton with the cteq3 m structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 cross section does not change significantly , nor does the direct top cross section when the up quark coupling is used .    </S>",
    "<S> we considered cases with and without b - tagging for each of the possibilities in table [ results ] . with the exception of run 1 at the tevatron </S>",
    "<S> , b - tagging improved the discovery limit on @xmath9 by @xmath10 times . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the data from run 1 at the tevatron , b - tagging improves the discovery limit by only @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this is mostly due to less efficient b - tagging , and to the smaller number of events available with a lower luminosity .    in some single top quark </S>",
    "<S> production processes , there are regions of overlap between , for example , @xmath12 subprocesses and @xmath13 subprocesses . in particular , we worried about an overlap between the direct top production and the gluon fusion diagram in which one of the gluons is dissociated into a @xmath14 pair , and the @xmath15 combines with the other gluon to produce a top quark . </S>",
    "<S> care must be taken with these processes to avoid double counting . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic method exists for calculating a subtraction term which solves this difficulty@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the double counting is most significant if the initial state particles are massive . in the case of direct top quark production due to anomalous t - c - g or t - u - g couplings , </S>",
    "<S> the initial state particles are light enough that this does not significantly affect the overall cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore ignored this effect in our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> although the background due to single top quark production ( a top quark with an associated jet ) is small in the sm , there exists also the possibility for single top quark production with the anomalous t - c - g ( or t - u - g ) coupling , e.g. via @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the jet associated with the top quark is not seen , this would enhance the direct top signal due to the anomalous coupling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the discovery limits quoted in table [ results ] are conservative estimates of the level to which @xmath9 may be probed . </S>",
    "<S> a full treatment of single top production due to the anomalous t - c - g and t - u - g couplings will be considered elsewhere .    in conclusion , we have calculated the discovery limits for the anomalous chromomagnetic couplings t - c - g and t - u - g in hadron colliders using direct production of an s - channel top quark . </S>",
    "<S> we conservatively estimate that an anomalous charm quark coupling can be detected down to @xmath18 at run 2 of the tevatron , and @xmath2 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for the anomalous up quark coupling is larger , and we can measure @xmath3 down to @xmath19 at run 2 of the tevatron , and @xmath20 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery limits for the upgraded tevatron are approximately two ( six ) times better than those obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative size of the direct top production and the anomalous top decay rate will help to differentiate the t - c - g and the t - u - g couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that , in ref @xcite , the authors found that electroweak - like corrections in a supersymmetric model can give br(@xmath21 ) as large as @xmath22 for the most favorable combinations of the parameters . in terms of our anomalous coupling parameter </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to @xmath23 . if supersymmetry is the only source for the anomalous t - c - g coupling , our calculations therefore indicate that future improvements at the lhc will be needed to make this a detectable signal , unless qcd - like corrections @xcite further enhance the susy contributions , as discussed in ref . </S>",
