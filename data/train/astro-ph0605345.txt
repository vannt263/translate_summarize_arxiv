    "the massive star populations of nearby galaxies are a subject of great interest , due to the impact that massive stars have on the galaxies properties and evolution .",
    "massive stars , in their short lifetime , drive the chemical and dynamical evolution of the parent galaxies and trace the star  formation activity .",
    "the most luminous , most massive stars provide information on the initial mass function ( imf ) and its properties .",
    "the study of the imf in different environments gives us a way to determine its dependence on parameters such as metallicity and star  formation rate .",
    "the galaxies of the local group provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the modalities of star formation through the resolved studies of their stellar populations , because they are close enough so that individual stars can be accurately measured , and all the stars are at approximately the same , known distance thus their absolute luminosity can be derived . with its high resolving power , and wide range of filters including uv wavelengths , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) is the most suitable instrument for studying young stellar populations in the local group galaxies . in a global context",
    ", studies of resolved local starbursts provide a key to understand distant star - forming galaxies , for which only integrated properties can be measured .",
    "resolved studies of the stellar content , extinction and global parameters of nearby starburst regions in different environments provide a calibration to interpret integrated studies of unresolved starbursts in distant galaxies .",
    "ngc6822 is an irregular dwarf galaxy , a member of the local group .",
    "the angular size of the galaxy at optical wavelengths is @xmath15 and its distance is estimated to be 500 kpc ( mcgonegal at al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "the old and intermediate stellar populations of ngc6822 have been studied by gallart et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on a central 11.2@xmath3 @xmath0 10.4@xmath3 area , and by wyder ( 2003 ) in four hst - wfpc2 fields , from v and i band photometry .",
    "both studies infer from the cmd that the star formation began 12 - 15gyr ago or more recently , depending on the initial metallicity assumed , and proceeded more or less uniformly until about 600myr ago .",
    "the young stellar population of ngc6822 , and its recent star formation history , has also been the subject of previous photometric studies . the first galaxy  wide photographic ubv photometry of ngc6822 was published by kayser ( 1967 ) , followed by a photographic and photoelectric study by hodge ( 1977 ) , who catalogued sixteen ob associations .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ground - based photometric study found that o - type stars are present in several of the ob associations , but that ngc6822 is relatively poor in very massive stars compared to m31 , m33 and the magellanic clouds ; the reddening varies from = 0.26 on the periphery to 0.45 near the central regions , with an average ratio @xmath16 of @xmath17 .",

    "forming hii regions hubble v and hubble x ( hubble 1925 )",
    ". the outer parts of the galaxy are much less studied .",
    "no young stellar population was found in the two outer regions of ngc6822 analyzed by hutchings , cavanagh , & bianchi ( 1999 ) .",
    "the search for young stars in different galaxy environments presented in this paper covers larger regions than previous hst studies , with deeper exposures , and has the advantages of the hst wide wavelength coverage ( extending to the uv ) , and higher spatial resolution , compared to the ground - based ubv data . the uv bands ( wfpc2 f170w and f255w , _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) mama - fuv and mama - nuv ) in addition to the u , b , v bands , allow us to identify the most massive , luminous stars .",
    "in fact , due to their high effective temperatures , the earliest spectral types can not be differenciated from optical colors ( see e.g. the discussion in massey ( 1998a ) and bianchi & tolea , 2006 , in preparation ) .    the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 , the photometry measurements and the characteristics of the stellar populations are presented in section 3 , the results are discussed in section 4 , and summarized in section 5 .",

    "the positions of the fields are shown in figure  [ fig : fld ] .",
    "the images processed with the post observation data processing system ( pods ) pipeline for bias removal and flat fielding were downloaded from the mast archive . in order to reject the cosmic rays , images taken with the same",

    "this task combines multiple exposures at the same pointing and rejects the high counts that occur in only one of the frames .",
    "it was possible to apply this procedure to all the fields , because we have at least two images per filter for each pointing .",
    "the source extractor code ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) was then used to detect the star - like objects exceeding the local background by more than @xmath22 in the f555w images . then aperture photometry was performed , using the same positions in all the filters .",
    "slight recentering ( less than 2 pixels ) from the f555w position was needed to optimize centering of the objects from filter to filter .",
    "we performed the photometry with the phot task in the daophot / iraf package , using the source list and positions from source extractor . the aperture chosen for both pc and",
    "wf chips was 3 pixels , and the sky was measured in an annulus with inner and outer radii of 5 and 8 pixels respectively .",
    "aperture corrections to 0.5 aperture were measured using isolated stars separately for the different chips and filters .",
    "aperture photometry was chosen over psf photometry to ensure a uniform procedure among our fields , and consistent with previous works .",
    "crowding effects are negligible in our fields .",
    "the wfpc2 fields in particular contain fairly sparse populations ( the most crowded region is shown in fig.6 ) , and the only crowded region , hubble  v , was observed with stis at uv wavelengths , where crowding is much less than at optical wavelengths .",
    "the flux calibration was performed following holtzman et al .",

    "were multiplied by the correction image provided by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "( ii ) correction for contamination : due to contaminants buildup on the cold ccd plate the uv throughput decreases . the photometric correction to be applied depends on the time elapsed since the last decontamination procedure .",
    "decontamination correction coefficients were taken from mcmaster & whitmore ( 2002 ) .",
    "( iii ) charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) correction : the formula of dolphin ( 2000 ) was applied .",
    "the magnitudes were then transformed in the hst vegamag photometric system by applying the zero points as follows : for f336w , f439w and f555w , we used the zero points from dolphin s ( 2002 ) web site , which are relative to a 0.5 aperture .",
    "the zero points for f170w and f255w were taken from the hst data handbook for wfpc2 with a @xmath23 correction for the transition from infinite to 0.5 aperture . for our analysis we used the vegamag wfpc2 photometric system , but in table 3 ( the hottest stars ) the f336w , f439w and f555w magnitudes are also transformed to the johnson s ubv system to allow comparisons with other works .",
    "the error vs magnitude plots of a typical field ( field 10 ) for all the filters used are shown in figure  [ fig : err ] .",
    "such diagrams are used to estimate the magnitude limits of our sample after we impose error cuts for the analysis described in section [ s_analysis ] .",
    "the overlapping fields were processed separately and photometry was performed in each field independently .",
    "the measured magnitudes of stars included in several fields are consistent within the errors .",
    "the magnitude given in the final catalog is an error weighted average of all the measurements for the same star .",
    "the formula used is @xmath24 , where n is the number of overlapping fields in which the star is present .",
    "the corresponding error is calculated as : @xmath25    the deepest observations are in the f555w band , where 18244 stars are detected ( above 3.5@xmath26 ) ; 12423 ( 70% ) of them have photometric accuracy better than @xmath27 .",
    "the number of stars with errors smaller than @xmath27 in the f439w filter is 1757 and in f336w the number of stars with accuracy better than @xmath27 is only 535 ( 2.7% of the stars detected in f555w ) .",

    "this previous work provides photometry in four wfpc2 filters , f555w , f439w , f336w and f255w , that will be combined with the uv stis photometry in the analysis described in the next section .",
    "the stis images contain the ob8 association ( hodge 1977 ) embedded in the hii region hubble v. the stis imaging provides a gain of over 2 magnitudes in nuv with respect to the earlier wfpc2 data , and the first observations of this region in the fuv .",
    "we have six band photometry ( four bands from bianchi et al .",
    "2001a wfpc2 photometry and two from our stis photometry ) for 72 out of the 80 stars detected in our stis imaging .",
    "in this section we analyze the multi - band photometry of individual stars and derive their physical parameters by comparison with model colors .",
    "two methods are used , and the results are compared . for the stars with good photometric measurements in all the filters , we fit all the observed colors with model colors , to which various reddening amounts are applied , and derive simultaneously stellar   and interstellar extinction . for the stars not detected in the uv filters , or with large uncertainties in the uv - band measurements , we use a method similar to",
    "the traditional `` reddening - free '' _ q _ index .      the observational color  magnitude diagrams in the f336w , f439w and f555w filters are shown in figure  [ fig : clm ] , for all stars in the group 1 fields ( open circles ) and in the group 2 fields ( filled circles ) .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the magnitude limits of the `` restricted sample '' analysed in the following sections .",
    "as described in earlier studies a `` blue plume '' is present , at @xmath34 ( see e.g. bianchi et al .",
    "2001a ) indicating h - burning massive stars , especially prominent in the group  1 population .",
    "there are a few blue stars in the outer parts of ngc6822 ( group 2 fields ) .",
    "most of the blue stars in our sample are found in the group  1 fields which are closer to the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the majority of the blue stars is located in the wf3 chip of field  36 , shown in figure  [ fig : f36 ] .",
    "this field contains most of the association ob15 identified by hodge ( 1977 ) .",
    "there are 47 blue stars with good photometry in all the five filters , 46 of them in the `` group 1 '' fields and only one in the `` group 2 '' fields .",
    "their photometry is given in table   3 .",
    "the majority of red and intermediate color stars in our sample is expected to be foreground contamination at the latitude of ngc  6822 .",
    "the model of ratnatunga & bachall ( 1985 ) predicts most of the foreground stars in the direction of ngc6822 with observed magnitudes @xmath35 to have @xmath36 , which is the area of the hr diagram where most of the stars from the `` group  2 '' fields are found .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the expected number of foreground stars in a given color and visual magnitude range , and the number of group  2 stars with the same colors and magnitudes , for the brighter magnitudes , but at fainter magnitudes the number of stars measured exceeds the number of predicted foreground stars ( figure  [ fig : fgs ] ) .",
    "the number of foreground stars given in the figure is calculated from the model of ratnatunga & bachall ( 1985 ) for an area @xmath37 ( as covered by our group  2 fields ) , the number of stars detected in each bin is also reported . for magnitudes above the limits of our `` restricted sample '' ( next section ) there is good agreement , suggesting that most stars in `` group  2 '' are foreground , therefore we can use the `` group  2 '' sample to estimate the foreground contamination in the `` group  1 '' sample , above @xmath38 . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "we detect significantly more objects than predicted by the ratnatunga & bachall ( 1985 ) model .",
    "however , these authors warn that for @xmath39 or @xmath40 their model should be used with caution because these regions are outside the galactic latitudes or apparent magnitudes tested .",
    "we can not establish , with our present sample , whether the excess of faint stars ( up to 7 times more stars detected than predicted for ( b - v)@xmath90.8 and @xmath41 ) is due to an old population in the outskirts of ngc  6822 , or if the model of ratnatunga & bachall ( 1985 ) needs to be significantly revised in this magnitude range .",
    "the question could be clarified by deep imaging with a ground - based telescope .    using the cmd of the group  2 sample to estimate the foreground contamination of the group  1 sample , we find that the majority ( @xmath42 ) of the intermediate color stars ( @xmath36 ) are foreground objects",
    ". the fraction drops to @xmath43 for stars with bluer color ( @xmath44 ) , and is negligible at @xmath45 .",
    "we conclude that foreground stars are a significant contamination in the red part of the cmd ( both from the ratnatunga & bachall model and by using our group  2 fields as a proxy for the foreground stars estimate ) while they do nt affect the estimate of the hot massive stars ( @xmath46 ) content .      here",
    "we use the observed photometry to determine the stellar physical parameters . in the first method , known as the `` q - method ''",
    ", we construct reddening free indexes ( q ) , using different combinations of two colors to determine the amount of reddening and the stellar temperature concurrently .",
    "this method is applicable to all stars that have good measurements in at least three photometric bands . in the second method",
    "we determine the values of and using all available bands by simultaneous fitting of the observed colors to synthetic colors using @xmath47 minimization . for this purpose we used both a modified version of the bianchi et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , romaniello ( 1998 ) code , and the chorizos code by maz - apellaniz ( 2004 ) .",
    "both codes give consistent results .",
    "this method is applicable to the stars with good photometry in four or more bands .    to describe the analysis with the reddening - free index method",
    ", we first consider photometry in the f336w , f439w , and f555w filters , since our data reach fainter magnitudes in these bands ( figure [ fig : err ] ) .",
    "we limit the analysis to stars with photometric errors of 0.05 , 0.08 and 0.10 mag in f555w , f439w and f336w respectively ( `` restricted sample '' ) .",
    "the error on the reddening - free index , and hence on the derived parameters , is a combination of the errors in the three bands .",
    "we applied a progressively less stringent error cut from the v - band to the u - band measurements , in order to approximately match the depth of the sample in these three bands for the `` blue plume '' , and still have an overall good accuracy of the q - index .",
    "the blue plume has average colors of ( m@xmath48 - m@xmath49 ) @xmath11 0.2 and ( m@xmath50 - m@xmath48 ) @xmath11 -1.2 , therefore the same `` depth '' of the sample is reached for m@xmath50 @xmath11 m@xmath48 - 1.2 @xmath7 m@xmath49 - 1 .",
    "our chosen error cut of 0.1  mag for the m@xmath50 magnitudes , limits the m@xmath50 measurements to @xmath7 21.5  mag ( figure [ fig : err ] ) .",
    "the corresponding errors limits in m@xmath48 and m@xmath49 are 0.08 and 0.05  mag for our `` restricted sample '' .",
    "these error limits combined translate in a maximum uncertainty for reddening - free index of q@xmath51@xmath9 0.16 , which propagates into errors on the derived parameters according to the parameters regime , as can be seen in figure [ fig : qss ] . the restricted sample defined above is hence limited to m@xmath49 @xmath7 22.5 mag , and the number of objects to 230 . for red supergiants , having ( m@xmath48 - m@xmath49 ) @xmath11 1 . and ( m@xmath50 - m@xmath48 )",
    "@xmath11 0.0.5 , the limit of our restricted sample becomes m@xmath49 @xmath7 20.521.0  mag , basically driven by the u - band error cut of 0.1  mag .",
    "we also consider a less restrictive sample ( `` wider sample '' ) , with error limits of 0.17 , 0.11 , and 0.07  mag in m@xmath50 , m@xmath48 and m@xmath49 respectively ( q@xmath51@xmath90.24 ) , which increases the number of objects by 130 stars , and extends the limit to m@xmath49 @xmath7 23  mag .",
    "the total number of objects in the `` wider sample '' is therefore 360 ; values of   and   from the analysis described below are given in table 3 ( electronic version ) for 345 stars of this sample ; the remaining 15 objects have colors in the range where the q - method is not applicable ( q is not reddening - free ) , and are probably foreground cool stars . table [ tbl : errs ] gives the number of objects in each filter within given error limits .",
    "the `` reddening free '' q index is a combination of two different colors ( usually from three bands ) with the ratio of the two color - excesses , so that its value does not depend on the reddening .",
    "the classical q - index is constructed with magnitudes in u , b and v ( e.g. massey 1998a ) : @xmath52 @xmath53=\\ ] ] @xmath54    where the subscript @xmath55 indicates intrinsic colors .",
    "a similar index can be constructed for any combination of at least three filters .",
    "the observed value of @xmath56 is equal to the intrinsic one , hence it provides a reddening independent direct measurement of , to the extent that the ratio @xmath57 is actually constant .",
    "this is a good approximation for low values of .",
    "if we were using monochromatic fluxes , @xmath58 would be constant for any amount of reddening , and would only depend on the type of extinction , i.e. on the extinction curve adopted . in practice , when we use broad band filters , because both and reddening variations change the slope of the spectrum within the band , @xmath58 is constant only within limited ranges of and   ( see bianchi & tolea 2006 for further discussion ) .",
    "we constructed q indexes ( as a function of stellar parameters ) in the hst filter system using a grid of synthetic colors , obtained by applying the transmission curves of the wfpc2 filters to kurucz synthetic stellar spectra models of lejeune et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and bianchi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "our model colors cover a large range in stellar parameters and log(g ) , for different metallicities .",
    "the effects of differing amounts and types of extinction are applied to the model spectra , and synthetic colors are computed applying the filter curves to the reddened models .",
    "therefore , our grids of model colors allow us to also derive the value of _ c _ for various types of reddening , and to verify within what limits it remains actually constant .",
    "we initially adopt mw type extinction ( @xmath59 ) assuming that in our sample most of the extinction is due to milky way foreground dust , which is confirmed by our results .",
    "the mw reddening law ( @xmath59 ) was also found appropriate for ngc6822 by massey et al . ( 1995 ) . from our model colors , we found @xmath60 to be constant in the temperature range @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath9 0.7 ] , with a value of @xmath60 = 0.96 .",
    "we use the @xmath62 index to derive the extinction and the stellar temperatures in these intervals .",
    "we can also use @xmath62 for the stars in the range @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath9 0.7 ] , with @xmath60=0.90 .    because a higher reddening applied to a hot star spectrum",
    "can mimic a less reddened cooler spectrum , in certain parameter ranges the solution [ , ] is not unique , as can be seen from figure [ fig : qss ] . since the q index is reddening independent ( within the applicable range ) , on the color  q diagram the reddening only displaces the points in color ( along the x - axis in figure [ fig : qss ] ) .",
    "the difference in color between the observed points and the model colors ( corresponding to the intrinsic colors ) provides an estimate of the extinction , while the value of q provides . in the ranges where , for a given observed color and q , the intrinsic color has more than one possible value ( @xmath64 $ ] , ( m@xmath48 - m@xmath49 ) @xmath65 0.2 for solar metallicity , see figure [ fig : qss ] ) different solutions for [ , ] exist .    in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : qss ]",
    "we plot the synthetic @xmath62 index vs the color @xmath66 .",
    "the observed values are shown as dots for our `` restricted '' sample ( stars with error in q better than 0.16 ) , and with crosses for the `` wider '' sample ( 0.24@xmath670.16 ) .",
    "the solid lines represent model colors for main sequence stars ( thick : solar metallicity , thin : z=0.002 ) .",
    "the model curves show that : for @xmath62 @xmath68 - 0.7 ( the exact value slightly depending on metallicity ) there is only one solution ; for more positive values of @xmath62 there are the following possibilities : when @xmath69 there is a unique solution for [ , ] , for stars with @xmath70 there are two possible solutions , and for @xmath71 , there are three possible solutions . in the case of this study , however , we notice that when there are more than one possible solution , the lowest value of   is similar to the average   in the field .",
    "the values of   from the other possible solutions significantly exceed any value of   determined in these fields for the stars with a unique solution , and exceed by @xmath7 0.8 mag the average   determined in the galaxy by this and previous works .",
    "this difference can be appreciated at a glance from figure 7 .",
    "therefore we choose the solution [ , ] with the lowest extinction value , assuming that there is no reason for the extinction to vary extremely in such sparse fields .",
    "for the same reason , for those stars that have @xmath72 and formally a unique solution from the q- diagram implying @xmath65 0.5 , we adopted instead the average value of = 0.27 ( as determined from the `` restricted sample '' in the field population outside of ob15 ) for those stars in the `` group 1 '' fields , and = 0.2 for those located in the `` group 2 '' fields .",
    "these objects are seen as a small `` plume '' above the model - q curves for red stars in figure 7 , and are indentified with flags `` c '' and `` d '' respectively in the electronic version of table 3 .",
    "theoretically , they could be hot stars with very high extinction , but the majority is likely foreground stars .",
    "an interesting feature of the color @xmath73 q diagram is the separation of the model color curves for different gravities .",

    "a group of @xmath11 25 stars with high values of q can be classified as supergiants , based on the photometry , indicating that these cooler objects belong to ngc  6822 and are not foreground stars .",
    "they are found in the `` group  1 '' fields , ( 4 in the area of ob15 ) and only 1 or 2 are found in the `` group  2 '' fields .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath62 using low metallicity models ( z=0.002 ; thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : qss ] upper panel ) in order to check how metallicity affects the color  q diagram .",
    "the solutions for hot stars ( down to 10000k ) do not differ significantly with metallicity but for low temperature stars the results for and depend on metallicity .",
    "this paper is focussed on the hot massive stellar population of ngc6822 , so the choice of metallicity does not affect our results .    for stars detected also in the uv , we constructed additional q indexes including the f170w magnitude , which provides a more sensitive measurement of the high temperatures and especially of the extinction .",
    "as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : qss ] , @xmath75 spans over 2  mag in the   range 10000 - 35000  k , compared to the @xmath71  mag variation of q@xmath76 .",
    "however , the larger uncertainties in the uv photometry , due to the lower sensitivity of the ccd at uv wavelengths , limit the advantage of these broader wavelength coverage to the hottest objects . we found , from our model colors , @xmath77=4.15 , approximately constant for @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 0.7 .",
    "the model values of @xmath75 for low gravity stars again separate from the dwarfs for temperatures between 10000k and 8000k .",

    "the h@xmath2 flux , when integrated over the spatial extent of the stellar associations , is about 3 times higher in h  v than in ob15 .",
    "however , while the h@xmath2 emission in h  v appears compact , as is the stellar cluster , the ob15 association is surrounded by a larger , multi - shell like h@xmath2 envelope . when we integrate the h@xmath2 flux over this larger bubble , seemingly associated with the ob  15 stars from its morphology , its total flux is comparable to the emission from h  v. it is also important that we could extend the census of massive stars in these two associations down to early b spectral types , where a few myr age difference would not change the sample ( numerical ) statistics , making the comparison robust .",
    "earlier ground - based surveys comparing the massive star content of local group galaxies were necessarily limited to higher masses , where both small number ( imf ) statistics , and a few myrs difference in the ages of the very young clusters ( dominating the census of massive stars ) can bias the results significantly .",
    "for example , massey et al .",
    "1995 seminal paper on three representative local group galaxies m31 , m33 and ngc6822 , compared the number of stars more massive than 40   per kpc@xmath13 . from the massive star content , we estimated the total mass of the associations , and found @xmath7 4  x  10@xmath12   for a mass range of 1 - 100(salpeter imf ) , or @xmath7 7  x  10@xmath12   extending the mass range to 0.1   with the imf of kroupa ( 2001 ) .",
    "our results confirm and quantify previous evidence that the recent / current star formation in ngc  6822 occurs episodically with extreme spatial variations in intensity and modality . the earlier star formation in this galaxy , according to gallart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and wyder ( 2003 ) has proceeded smoothly ( relatively constant , or slightly increasing with time ) until @xmath11 1 gyr ago .",
    "of course , while time and space variations of the recent star formation can be appreciated in detail from the study of young massive stars , such distinctions can not be made for older populations , where the sfh is inferred from an hrd integrated over longer epochs , and dynamical relaxation blurs or erases initial spatial stuctures .",
