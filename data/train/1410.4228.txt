    "measurements of the ground state properties of the most basic element of the constituents of stable matter , namely , the proton , have intrigued physicists since the sixties until now .",
    "the structure of the proton in fact plays an important role in atomic physics where experiments have reached very high precision .",
    "finite size effects ( fse ) due to the proton structure can be theoretically included using different methods , with one of them being the breit equation @xcite which is a typical example of how one derives coordinate potentials from quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "using such a method where one evaluates the elastic electron - proton amplitude expanded in powers of @xmath1 , corrections to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom due to the finite size of the proton have been evaluated @xcite .",
    "the fse are included through the elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained from electron proton scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors as such are an essential part of the description of the properties of the nucleon as they incorporate the probability for a nucleon to absorb a virtual photon of four momentum squared @xmath4 and probe its interior . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the fourier transforms of the form factors in the breit frame ( defined by @xmath5 ) describe the charge distribution @xmath6 and magnetization current distribution @xmath7 in the nucleon respectively @xcite .",
    "an experimental determination of the form factors ( and hence the proton charge density distribution ) from electron proton scattering can thus enable one to determine the charge radius of the proton .",
    "on the other hand , the unprecedented precision of the experimental results in the hydrogen atom also allows one to probe the static properties of one of the components of the hydrogen atom , namely , the proton .",
    "the size of the proton for example , can be extracted from precise measurements of the difference in the energy levels or lamb shifts in the hydrogen atom .",
    "such an extraction performed on the muonic hydrogen atom led to the surprising finding that the extracted value of @xmath8 fm was much smaller than the world average codata value of @xmath9 fm @xcite .",
    "this so - called  proton puzzle \" was later reinforced @xcite with the precise value of @xmath10 fm obtained from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy .",
    "apart from some determinations from standard hydrogen atom spectroscopy , the codata value largely depends on the extraction of the radius from electron proton scattering experiments .",
    "the shrunk proton gave rise to explanations ranging from the charge density being poorly constrained by data @xcite to those involving large extra dimensions and non - identical protons @xcite .    in an attempt",
    "to resolve the discrepancy between the proton radius from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy and electron proton scattering data , we re - examine the connection of the electromagnetic form factors to the nucleon properties .",
    "we present a new approach to relate the form factors in momentum space to their coordinate space counter parts ( the charge and magnetization densities ) through a fourier transform of the type @xmath11 .",
    "the standard non - relativistic expression is obtained when @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the well known sachs form factor @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections for @xmath14 are incorporated by evaluating @xmath15 in the form @xmath16 $ ] using the higher order breit equation which we derive in this work .",
    "since such a relation is still valid only in the breit frame ( i.e. @xmath17 ) , a lorentz boost must be applied to @xmath15 before extracting the mean radius from @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the two effects ( lorentz boost and use of the higher order breit equation ) brings the radius extracted from electron proton scattering quite close to that determined from the muonic hydrogen lamb shift @xcite , thus partly resolving the proton radius puzzle .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the non - relativistic @xmath14 are obtained by extending the standard breit equation @xcite ( which involves an expansion of the amplitude to order 1/c@xmath19 ) @xcite to higher orders .",
    "the proton electric potential @xmath20 in this equation is used to find the density @xmath6 via the poisson equation , @xmath21 .",
    "the hyperfine interaction terms in the breit equation are shown to be related to the magnetization density @xmath7 . in what follows",
    ", we shall see that an interesting outcome of the calculation is that the charge form factor @xmath22 appearing in the fourier transform , depends on the magnetic form factor @xmath23 and @xmath24 appearing in the fourier transform of the magnetization density , @xmath7 , depends on @xmath13 .      in order to make the approach clear",
    "let us begin with the standard breit equation for the hamiltonian h@xmath25 @xcite which results from the @xmath1 expansion of the elastic electron proton transition matrix element m@xmath26 .",
    "this amplitude can be written as , m@xmath27 , where @xmath28 are two component spinors . in the diagonal case , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and we write m@xmath31 , where we used @xmath32   = { \\bm \\xi}$ ] with @xmath33 being the spin density matrix .",
    "let us now rearrange terms from the breit hamiltonian h@xmath25 such that , h@xmath34 , where , @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the potential part remaining after separating all the @xmath37 operator dependent and differential operator @xmath38 dependent terms . here",
    "@xmath39 is either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we choose @xmath36 not to contain the electron mass as the electric proton potential should not depend on the probe .",
    "these restrictions allow @xmath36 to be interpreted as a proton electric potential in momentum space . for the standard breit equation at lowest order in @xmath1 , with form factors ,",
    "this indeed leads to @xcite , @xmath42\\ ,    = 4 \\pi e \\ ,   \\biggl [ { g_e({\\bm q}^{2})\\over { \\bm q}^{2 } } \\biggr ] .\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the positive charge of the proton .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath36 is then the electric potential @xmath43 .",
    "the laplacian of @xmath20 , namely , @xmath44 taken together with @xmath45 then brings us to the standard definition of the proton charge density @xmath46 . applying similar restrictions to the magnetic field in the second term in h@xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , the magnetic field of the proton @xmath47 should not contain any electron mass or operator @xmath38 dependence , the terms which remain ( apart from the coulomb term ) are those corresponding to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the hyperfine interaction potential with form factors @xcite is given as , @xmath48   g_m({\\bm q}^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ , { \\bf \\mu}_e \\cdot { \\bf b}({\\bm q})\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 as defined earlier",
    ". the magnetic field of the proton is thus , @xmath50 g_m({\\bm q}^2)\\ , .\\ ] ] taking the fourier transform of @xmath51 and using the static maxwell equation @xmath52 , we can identify @xmath53 thus implying @xmath54 with @xmath55 which defines the proton magnetization distribution @xmath56 . in the diagonal case , by the replacement of @xmath57 by the polarization vector @xmath58 , we can conclude that polarized protons will have a magnetic field of the form , @xmath59 , where , @xmath60 .",
    "all the conclusions drawn above and derived at the lowest order in the relativistic expansion are , of course , valid if we include relativistic corrections .",
    "the procedure to obtain the breit potential at higher orders using the electron proton scattering amplitude is exactly the same as that described in @xcite except that the proton and electron wave functions which were written in @xcite using the non - relativistic approximation with corrections up to order @xmath1 are now replaced by those containing relativistic corrections up to order @xmath61 .",
    "this is done by using the foldy wouthuysen transformation @xcite , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 the usual dirac matrices .",
    "it then follows that @xcite @xmath69 \\psi_{\\!_d}$ ] , where , @xmath70 contains both the positive and negative energy solutions .",
    "the upper and lower components @xmath71 and @xmath72 of @xmath70 can be shown to be related to the dirac upper and lower components @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively as @xcite @xmath75 the relativistic energy @xmath76 of the particle includes also its rest energy @xmath77 which must be excluded in arriving at a non - relativistic approximation . we must therefore replace @xmath78 ( fw or d ) by @xmath79 defined as @xmath80 .",
    "this leads to a relation between the upper and lower components @xmath81 and @xmath82 of @xmath79 @xcite which is given by , @xmath83^{-1 } \\ ,   \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$ } \\cdot { \\bf p}\\ , \\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the energy eigenvalue in the schrdinger equation . identifying the upper component @xmath85 of @xmath70 with the non - relativistic schrdinger spinor @xmath86",
    ", we get , @xmath87 .",
    "finally , expanding @xmath88 and replacing for @xmath81 in terms of @xmath86 in @xmath82 , we obtain the spinor to be used in the calculation of the amplitude @xmath89 as @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the above spinor should be contrasted with @xmath96 used to obtain the standard breit equation @xcite .",
    "( [ spinoreq2 ] ) and the vertices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the amplitude @xmath99 and hence the breit equation with form factors is evaluated just as in @xcite .",
    "note that the energy transfer at the vertices is chosen to be zero , i.e. , @xmath100 is replaced by @xmath101 .",
    "formally , this is achieved by going to the breit frame .",
    "this is in keeping with the quasistatic approach wherein we are going to relate the proton potential obtained from the breit equation to the charge density via the poisson equation .",
    "the higher order breit equation with form factors thus obtained is very lengthy and will be given elsewhere .",
    "the present work deals with the parts relevant for obtaining the relativistic corrections to the charge and magnetization densities .",
    "the proton electric potential @xmath102 with relativistic corrections is obtained from the higher order breit equation in the same manner as explained before for the standard breit equation .",

    "the magnetic form factor @xmath24 including corrections is obtained by examining the hyperfine interaction terms as mentioned before , however , in the higher order breit equation .",
    "noting that the terms of order @xmath61 and higher are of decreasing importance and due to the alternating sign in ( [ newpot1 ] ) , the first four terms in the curly bracket in ( [ newpot1 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath107^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the expressions for @xmath108 can thus be summarized in an expansion effectively as ,    @xmath109    with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath15 and @xmath24 depend on both the @xmath112 and @xmath113 sachs form factors and have relativistic corrections of a similar form with the same exponents @xmath114 and @xmath115 . note also that the exponent @xmath116 in the first terms is approximate ( in contrast to the exact @xmath107^{-1/2}$ ] in @xcite ) . at order @xmath1 ,",
    "the expression for @xmath117 is independent of @xmath113 as in @xcite , however , the magnetic form factor at order @xmath1 reduces to @xmath118 and contains apart from the darwin term @xmath119 , a term dependent on @xmath112 .",
    "since we chose the energy transfer in the evaluation of the electron - proton scattering amplitude , @xmath120 , the above form factors are similar to those usually given in the so - called breit frame .",
    "an additional important relativistic correction arises due to the lorentz contraction of the spatial distributions in the breit frame @xcite .",
    "the latter has been discussed at length in the first reference of @xcite where the author proposes the use of the fourier transform of @xmath121^{\\lambda_{e , m}}$ ] , rather than the fourier transform of @xmath122 in order to determine the density distributions of the nucleon . with @xmath123 being model dependent constants ,",
    "they eventually appear as parameters in the determination of the proton radius and other moments .",
    "the author in the first reference in @xcite fitted the form factor data to obtain @xmath124 in agreement with some @xcite while in contrast with other predictions @xcite of @xmath125 and @xmath126 based on soliton and cluster models .",
    "the standard way of defining the @xmath127 moment of the charge and magnetization distribution in literature @xcite follows from a consideration of the fourier transforms of the sachs form factors in the breit frame .",
    "it makes sense to dwell a little bit on the basics of the definition of the second moment , i.e. , @xmath128 starting with the fourier transform of @xmath129 , namely , @xmath130 we can readily show that @xmath131\\nonumber \\\\ & = & { 1 \\over 2 \\pi^2 } \\ , \\biggl [   \\int_0^{\\infty } r^2 \\rho(r ) dr - { { \\bm q}^2 \\over 6 } \\int_0^{\\infty } r^4 \\ ,   \\rho(r ) dr \\ , + \\ , ... \\ , \\biggr ]",

    "( [ newx1 ] ) is equivalent to writing @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the @xmath127 moment of the electric or magnetic distribution .",
    "neither ( [ newx0 ] ) nor ( [ newx1 ] ) are relativistic invariants .",
    "the form factor @xmath135 which depends on the four momentum transfer is an invariant and sometimes one finds in the literature the expansion @xmath136 with @xmath137 being the four - momentum transfer .",
    "this is then followed by an expression of the first moment proportional to @xmath138 taken at @xmath139 .",
    "this in turn might lead to the confusing conclusion that the proton radius is a lorentz invariant . to resolve the confusion",
    "let us first note that we would get the same result by writing @xmath140 and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath141 evaluated at @xmath142 which agrees with ( [ newx2 ] ) and , of course , ( [ newx0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we would face a paradox here : by using ( [ newx3 ] ) and its derivative with respect to the four momentum squared @xmath143 , it seems like we have found a lorentz invariant quantity and this is equivalent to a lorentz non - invariant result ( up to the minus sign which is absorbed into the definition ) .",
    "the resolution of the paradox lies in the meaning of the condition , @xmath139 . with @xmath144 , it either means that @xmath145 ( in which case we have a real photon ) or @xmath146 .",
    "it is impossible to exchange a real photon in the t - channel exchange diagram in elastic electron - proton scattering and hence we have to drop the first possibility .",
    "the second choice is , however , equivalent to first choosing the frame ( @xmath147 implies that we have chosen the breit frame again ) and then @xmath142 is necessary to extract the taylor coefficient ( the radius ) . in short , even if @xmath138 is invariant , the condition @xmath148 makes the radius defined using @xmath138 at @xmath149 , a lorentz non - invariant quantity ( as the condition forces one to choose @xmath150 ) .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( defined by @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) , receive relativistic corrections as given in ( [ finalresult ] ) , so will the corresponding radii .",
    "hence , the proton moments including the relativistic corrections and the lorentz boost are defined here as : @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( with @xmath155^ { \\lambda_{\\!_{e}}}$ ] ) .",

    "the fourth moments @xmath164 of the proton charge distribution with corrections ( up to order 1/c@xmath19 and 1/c@xmath165 ) are given in the brackets ( in fm@xmath165 ) .",
    "the first column gives the usual uncorrected values obtained from @xmath167 scattering , the second column shows the increase in values due to relativistic corrections , the third and fourth the reduction due to lorentz boost and finally the last two columns display the effects of both corrections together . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the effect of the lorentz boost in general is to reduce the radius and the fourth moment of the proton charge as compared to that obtained from @xmath168 in the breit frame .",
    "the relativistic corrections introduced with the use of @xmath15 obtained from the higher order breit potential , in general , increase the radius of the proton .",
    "however , a fortuitous combination of the two effects , brings the proton radius closer to @xmath10 fm obtained from precise lamb shift measurements @xcite . for a lorentz boost with @xmath169 such an agreement",
    "is favoured by fit ii in @xcite which gives @xmath170 fm and @xmath171 fm obtained from the bump - tail parametrization ( with parameters from table ii in @xcite ) . indeed , if we apply the lorentz boost with @xmath172 to the central value of the radius @xmath2 fm deduced recently by bernauer et al .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath173 fm which is once again close to the muonic hydrogen spectroscopy result @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 1 .",
    "the reason for applying only the lorentz boost and not the entire relativistic corrections is the following : bernauer et al . include in their analysis , the  feshbach correction \" which as stated above eq.(20 ) in @xcite is in agreement with the coulomb correction of rosenfelder @xcite at @xmath174 .",
    "this correction of rosenfelder is similar to the relativistic corrections of the present paper upto order @xmath1 ( compare eq.(7 ) of @xcite with the first term in eq.([finalresult ] ) of the present work ) .",
    "it would lead to a double counting if we would apply the relativistic correction of our work to the radius of bernauer et al .",
    "and hence we apply only the lorentz boost . though we do not show explicitly",
    ", similar corrections would also shift the other radii in fig.1 , extracted from @xmath167 scattering , to lower values .",
    "the proton magnetic radius , @xmath175 fm @xcite , with relativistic and lorentz boost corrections changes to @xmath176 fm . finally , we must emphasize that the proton is characterized fully by all its moments and not just the radius .",
    "the corrections in eqs ( [ finalresult ] ) introduce a significant change in @xmath177 too .",
    "finally , in passing we mention that the proton structure corrections as such are also dependent on the theoretical formalism used to calculate them .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the proton structure corrections using different formalisms .",
    "the relations between charge / magnetization densities and the electromagnetic form factors are necessarily of a non - relativistic nature . in other words ,",
    "relativistic corrections can be computed and the standard relation between the sachs form factors ( @xmath13 and @xmath23 ) and the densities is valid only at the lowest order of the non - relativistic expansion . to compute the relativistic corrections in a consistent way we employed the higher order breit equation",
    "in which , for instance , terms independent of the probe , spin and momentum operators should correspond to the proton electric potential in momentum space . using the poisson equation ,",
    "this potential gives us the relativistically modified charge density .",
    "a similar procedure can be found for the magnetization density .",
    "both results are valid in the breit frame . hence using a lorentz transformation suggested in the literature",
    ", we can bring them to the rest frame of the proton and calculate the modified moments of the proton charge and magnetization densities .",
    "an interesting outcome of the manipulations , i.e. , including relativistic corrections and the lorentz transformation is that the proton radius from @xmath178 scattering experiments comes closer to the result obtained from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy .",
    "a free spin @xmath179 particle is described by a four component wave function satisfying the dirac equation .",
    "it is however , often desirable to convert this equation to a two component equation of the pauli type .",
    "methods attempting to do this however encounter difficulties if one wishes to go beyond the lowest order in the @xmath180 expansion .",
    "a method proposed by foldy and wouthuysen @xcite however overcomes these difficulties .",
    "their treatment involves a unitary transformation which block diagonalizes the dirac hamiltonian and eventually splits the dirac equation into two uncoupled equations of the pauli type , describing particles in positive- and negative - energy states , respectively . since the procedure to carry out the foldy - wouthuysen transformation",

    "<S> the proton charge and magnetization density distributions can be related to the well known sachs electromagnetic form factors @xmath0 through fourier transforms , only in the breit frame . </S>",
    "<S> the breit frame however moves with relativistic velocities in the lab and a lorentz boost must be applied to the form factors before extracting the static properties of the proton from the corresponding densities . apart from this , </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform relating the densities and form factors is inherently a non - relativistic expression . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the relativistic corrections to it can be obtained by extending the standard breit equation to higher orders in its @xmath1 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the inclusion of the above corrections reduces the size of the proton determined from electron proton scattering data . indeed </S>",
    "<S> the central value of the latest proton radius of @xmath2 fm as determined from e - p scattering changes to @xmath3 fm after applying corrections . </S>"
