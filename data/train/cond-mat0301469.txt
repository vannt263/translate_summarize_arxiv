    "the issue of diffusion of small light particles in a solvent composed of larger and heavier particles is unconventional because the role of the solvent in the solute diffusion is different from the case where the sizes are comparable .",
    "there are two limits that can be identified for such systems .",
    "one limit is the well studied lorentz gas system , which consists of a single point particle moving in a triangular array of immobile disk scatters . here",
    "the motion of the point particle can be modelled by random walk between traps.@xmath5 the other limit is where the size of the solute particle is still smaller than that of the solvent molecules but it has a finite size ( that is , not a point ) and while the solvent is slow ( compared to the solute particles ) but not completely immobile . in the latter case ,",
    "the translational diffusion of the solute is often attempted to describe by the well known hydrodynamic stokes - einstein ( se ) relation given by,@xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath9 is the absolute temperature , c is a numerical constant determined by the hydrodynamic boundary condition , @xmath10 is the shear viscosity of the solvent and @xmath11 is the radius of the diffusing particle .",
    "validity of eq .",
    "1 for small solutes is , of course , questionable.@xmath12    there have been many experimental,@xmath13 computer simulation@xmath14 and theoretical@xmath15 studies of diffusion of small solute particles in a solvent composed of larger particles .",
    "all these studies show that the se relation significantly underestimates the diffusion coefficient .",
    "to explain the enhanced diffusion , sometimes an empirical modification of the se relation is used.@xmath13 it is considered that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "this fractional viscosity dependence is referred to as the microviscosity effect which implies that the viscosity around the small solute is rather different from that of the bulk viscosity .",
    "the enhanced diffusion value has also been explained in terms of effective hydrodynamic radius.@xmath18    the earlier mode coupling theoretical ( mct ) studies@xmath15 of diffusion of smaller solutes in a solvent composed of larger size molecules attributed the enhanced diffusion to the decoupling of the solute motion from the structural relaxation of the solvent .",
    "the mct studies suggest that this decoupling of the solute motion from the structural relaxation of the solvent can lead to the fractional viscosity dependence often observed in supercooled liquids .",
    "however , there have been no systematic studies of the effects of the variation of size and mass of the solute - solvent system . in this article",
    "we have explored the diffusional mechanism of the isolated small particles ( solute ) in a liquid composed of larger particles ( solvent ) , both analytically and numerically .",
    "the study is performed by keeping the solvent - to - solute size ratio ( @xmath19 ) fixed at five , but varying the mass of the solvent over a large range , by keeping the mass of the solute fixed .",
    "that is , the mass ratio @xmath20 ( solvent mass / solute mass ) is progressively raised to higher values .",
    "this system is expected to mimic some aspects of the water - sucrose or water - polysaccharide mixtures.@xmath21    the trajectories of the solute and the solvent show coexistence of both hopping and continuous motions .",
    "as the solvent mass is increased , the self - intermediate scattering function of the solute develops an interesting stretching in the long time . for larger mass ratio",
    "we see the existence of two stretched exponentials separated by a power law type plateau .    the mode coupling theory calculation of the self - diffusion coefficient of solute particles performed in the limit of small mass ratio ( of 5 ) is found to be in qualitative agreement with the simulated diffusion ",
    "mct underestimates the diffusion by about @xmath4 .",
    "thus , although the mct underestimates the diffusion , the agreement is satisfactory in light of the contribution from the hopping mode to diffusion which mct does not explicitly take into account .",
    "however , the deviation from the simulated value increases with increase in mass ratio ( which is equivalent to the increase of the mass of the solvent particles ) . in the limit of large mass ratio ,",
    "mct breaks down .",
    "the binary contribution to the total friction is found to _ decrease _ as one increases the mass of the solvent .",
    "in addition , due to the development of stretching in the self - intermediate scattering function of the solute and the inherent slow solvent dynamics , there remains a strong coupling of the solute motion to the solvent density mode .",
    "this enhanced coupling at larger mass ratio came as a surprise to us .    in the limit of very large mass ratio",
    ", the motion of the light solute particle resembles to that of its motion in an almost frozen disorder system like near the glass transition temperature .",
    "thus , the breakdown of mct in the limit of large mass ratio could be connected to its failure near the glass transition temperature . of course",
    ", one should note that in the limit of mass of the solvent goes to infinity , the basic assumption of conventional mct breaks down .",
    "it is widely believed that in a deeply supercooled liquid close to its glass transition temperature ( @xmath22 ) , the hopping mode is the dominant mode in the system which controls the mass transport and the stress relaxation .",
    "recently , a computer simulation study of a deeply supercooled binary mixture@xmath23 has shown the evidence of an intimate connection between the anisotropy in local stress and the particle hopping .",
    "it was shown that the local anisotropy in the stress is responsible for the particle hopping in a particular direction .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that the local frustration present in the system ( which is more in a binary mixture with components of different sizes ) could cause the local anisotropy in the stress which in turn acts as a driving force for hopping .",
    "however , in the present study , the density ( or the pressure ) of the system is not as high as that of a deeply supercooled system .",
    "the relaxation of the stress is found to occur much faster and it relaxes almost completely within our simulation time window even for the largest mass ratio .",
    "consequently , the microscopic origin of particle hopping here could be different than that for a deeply supercooled liquid .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii deals with the system and simulation details .",
    "the simulation results and discussions are given in the next sec .",
    "iii and the mode coupling theoretical analysis is presented in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the possible effect of heterogeneity probed by the solute on the self - dynamic intermediate scattering function of the solute . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we present the conclusions of the study .",
    "we performed a series of equilibrium isothermal - isobaric ( n p t ) ensemble molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of binary mixtures in three dimensions for an infinitesimal small value of the mole fraction of one of the species .",
    "the binary system studied here contains a total of @xmath24 particles consisting of two species of particles , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 number of particles .",
    "hereafter , we refer the indices 1 and 2 , respectively , for the solvent and solute particles .",
    "thus , the mixture under study contains @xmath27 of solute particles .",
    "the interaction between any two particles is modeled by means of shifted force lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potential,@xmath28 where the standard lj is given by @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote two different particles ( 1 and 2 ) . in our model system ,",
    "the potential parameters are as follows : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( enhanced attraction ) , and @xmath37 .",
    "the mass of the solute particles is chosen to be @xmath38 where the solvent ( species 1 ) mass @xmath39 is increasingly varied and four different values are chosen 1 , 5 , 10 and 50 .",
    "thus , in this study we examined four different solvent - to - solute mass ratio , @xmath20 = @xmath40 = 5 , 25 , 50 and 250 for a fixed solvent - to - solute size ratio , @xmath19 = @xmath41 = 5 .",
    "note that in the model system being studied the solute - solvent interaction ( @xmath42 ) is much stronger than both of their respective pure counterparts . in order to lower the computational burden the potential has been truncated with a cutoff radius of 2.5@xmath43 .",
    "all the quantities in this study are given in reduced units , that is , length in units of @xmath43 , temperature @xmath9 in units of @xmath44 , pressure @xmath45 in units of @xmath46 , and the mass in the unit of @xmath47 , which can be assumed as argon ( ar ) mass unit .",
    "the corresponding microscopic time scale is @xmath48 .",
    "all simulations in the npt ensemble were performed using the nose - hoover - andersen method,@xmath49 where the external reduced temperature is held fixed at @xmath50 .",
    "the external reduced pressure has been kept fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "the reduced average density @xmath52 of the system corresponding to this thermodynamic state point is 0.989 for all the mass ratios being studied . throughout the course of the simulations , the barostat and the system s degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled to an independent nose - hoover chain@xmath53 ( nhc ) of thermostats , each of length 5 .",
    "the extended system equations of motion are integrated using the reversible integrator method@xmath54 with a small time step of @xmath55 .",
    "the higher order multiple time step method@xmath56 has been employed in the nhc evolution operator which lead to stable energy conservation for non - hamiltonian dynamical systems.@xmath57 the extended system time scale parameter used in the calculations was taken to be @xmath58 for both the barostat and thermostats .",
    "the systems were equilibrated for @xmath59 time steps and simulations were carried out for another @xmath60 production steps following equilibration , during which the quantities of interest are calculated .",
    "the dynamic quantities are averaged over three such independent runs for better improvement of the statistics .",
    "we have also calculated the partial radial distribution functions ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) to make sure that there is no crystallization .",
    "in figure 1 we show typical _ solute _ trajectories for four different solvent - to - solute mass ratio , @xmath20 ( @xmath63 , @xmath39 is the mass of the solvent particles ) .",
    "the trajectories reveal interesting dependence on @xmath20 . at the value of @xmath20 equal to five",
    ", the solute trajectory is mostly continuous with occasional hops . as the mass ratio @xmath20",
    "is increased , the solute motion gets more trapped and its motion tends to become discontinuous where displacements occur mostly by hopping .",
    "this is because with increase in the solvent mass the time scale of motion of the solvent particles become increasingly slower .",
    "thus , the solute gets caged by the solvent particles and keeps rattling between a cage till one solvent particle moves considerably to disperse the solute trajectory ( see trajectory for @xmath20 = 250 ) .",
    "thus , there is a remarkable change in solute s motion in going from @xmath20 = 5 ( figure 1a ) to @xmath20 = 250 ( figure 1d ) .    in figure 2",
    "we plot the _ solvent _",
    "trajectories for different solvent - to - solute mass ratio , @xmath20 .",
    "we find that for all values of @xmath20 , there is a coexistence of hopping and continuous motion of the solvent molecules . at higher solvent mass , as expected ,",
    "the magnitude of displacement becomes less and hopping becomes less frequent , but , surprisingly , the jump motion still persists .",
    "figure 3 displays the decay behavior of the self - intermediate scattering function ( @xmath0 ) of the solute for different mass ratio @xmath20 , at reduced wavenumber @xmath64 .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath0 begins to stretch more for higher solvent mass .",
    "this stretching of @xmath0 is kind of novel and we have examined it in detail .    after the initial gaussian decay , @xmath0 , for smaller values of @xmath20 , can be fitted to a single stretched exponential where the exponent @xmath65 .",
    "however , for higher mass of the solvent , @xmath0 can be fitted only to a sum of _ two _ stretched exponentials .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 of the _ solvent _ for all the solvent masses studied is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the plot shows that ( as expected ) the time scale of relaxation of @xmath0 becomes longer as the solvent mass is increased .",
    "however , the self - intermediate scattering function of the solvent does not display any stretching at long times , even for the largest mass ratio considered .",
    "the decay can be fitted by sum of a short - time gaussian and a long - time exponential function .",
    "the reason that @xmath0 of the solute shows such stretching but that of the solvent does not , can be explained as follows .",
    "due to the small size and the lighter weight of the solute , the time scale of motion of the solute particles is much shorter compared to that of the solvent particles .",
    "consequently , the solute motion probes more heterogeneity during the time scale of decay of @xmath0 of the solute .",
    "this heterogeneity probed by the solute increases as the solvent mass is increased .",
    "since the solvent motion is much slower , it probes enough configurations during the time scale of decay of its @xmath0 .    in order to quantify the degree of heterogeneity probed by the solute",
    ", we have plotted the non - gaussian parameter @xmath66,@xmath67 for the solute , in figure 5 .",
    "clearly , the heterogeneity probed by the solute ( quantified by the peak height of @xmath66 ) increases as the solvent mass is increased . on the other hand , @xmath66 of",
    "the solvent shows no such increase in the peak height of @xmath66 which remains small and unaltered , although the position of the peak shifts to longer time as the mass of the solvent is increased .",
    "we have discussed this analysis in more detail in section v.    the role of the local heterogeneity can be further explored by calculating @xmath0 at wavenumber corresponding to solute - solvent average separation .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . in figure 6",
    "we plot the self dynamic structure factor of the solute for different mass ratio @xmath20 , at reduced wavenumber @xmath70 .",
    "this is primarily the wavenumber probed by the solute . at this wavenumber one",
    "observes more stretching of @xmath0 at longer times , for all the mass ratios .",
    "this is in agreement with the above argument that since the time window probed by the solute is smaller at higher @xmath1 , it probes even larger heterogeneity .",
    "the emergence of the plateau between the two stretched exponentials in @xmath0 of the solute ( figure 6 ) , can be attributed to the separation of time scale of the binary collision and the solvent density mode contribution to the particle motion .",
    "this separation of time scale increases as the solvent mass is increased . as the decay",
    "after the plateau is mainly due to the density mode contribution , the plateau becomes more prominent as the mass of the solvent is increased .",
    "table i clearly shows the separation of time scales where the value of the time constants and the exponents obtained from the two different stretched exponential fits to @xmath0 are presented for different mass ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0 of each of the individual solute particle obtained from a single md run is shown in figure 7 , at @xmath70 and for @xmath20 = 250 .",
    "we find that not only all of them have different time scale of relaxation but each of them shows considerable stretching ( the exponent @xmath65 ) at longer time .",
    "this confirms further that each of the solute particle probes heterogeneous structure and dynamics of the solvent .    in table",
    "ii we present the scaled average ( over all the solute particles and three independent md runs ) diffusion value of the solute particles obtained from the slope of the mean square displacement ( msd ) in the diffusive limit , for different mass ratio , @xmath20 .",
    "the values of the solute diffusion decreases as the mass of the solvent is increased , as expected .",
    "the mass dependence can be fitted to a power law as clearly manifested in figure 8 where we have plotted ln @xmath71 against ln @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the self - diffusion of the solute particles .",
    "the slope of the line is about 0.13 .",
    "the small value of the exponent is clearly an indication of the weak mass dependence of the self - diffusion coefficient of small solute particle on the mass of the bigger solvent particles .",
    "interestingly , it is to be noted that a similar weak power law mass dependence was seen in the self - diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle on its mass  the exponent was often found to be around 0.1 .",
    "recently , a self - consistent mode coupling theory ( mct ) analysis successfully explained this weak mass dependence.@xmath74    in figure 9 we plot the normalized velocity autocorrelation function @xmath75 of the solute particles for the different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity correlation function shows highly interesting features at larger mass ratio .",
    "not only does the negative dip becomes larger , there develops a second minimum or an extended negative plateau which becomes prominent as the mass of the solvent is increased .",
    "interestingly , as can be seen from the figure the @xmath76 shows an oscillatory behavior that persists for long period .",
    "this is clearly evidence for the dynamic cage formation in which the solute particle is seen to execute a damped oscillatory motion .",
    "because of the increasing effective structural rigidity of the neighboring solvent particles as the mass of the solvent increases , the motion of the solute particle can be modelled as a damped oscillator which is reminiscent of the behavior observed in a deeply supercooled liquid near the glass transition temperature.@xmath77    the understanding of the microscopic origin of the development of an increasingly negative dip followed by pronounced oscillations at longer times in the velocity autocorrelation function of a supercooled liquid is a subject of much current interest .",
    "the novel molecular - dynamics simulation study of kivelson and his coworkers@xmath78 surely provide a step forward in this direction .",
    "their simulation study had shown that the single particle velocity autocorrelation function could be thought of as a sum of the local rattling motion relative to the center of mass of the neighboring cluster and the motion of the center of mass of that cluster .",
    "furthermore , it was observed that the rich structure displayed by the velocity autocorrelation function at high density arise primarily from the relative motion of the tagged particle , that is , the rattling motion within the cage formed by the neighboring particles .",
    "mode coupling theory remains the only quantitative fully microscopic theory for self - diffusion in strongly correlated systems . in this section",
    "we present a mode coupling theory calculation of the solute diffusion for different solvent - to - solute mass ratio @xmath20 .",
    "diffusion coefficient of a tagged solute is given by the well known einstein relation ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the diffusion coefficient of the solute and @xmath81 is the frequency dependent friction .",
    "@xmath82 is the mass of the solute particle .",
    "mode coupling theory provides an expression of the frequency dependent friction on an isolated solute in a solvent .    in the normal liquid regime ( in the absence of hopping transport ) it can be given by,@xmath15",
    "@xmath83    where @xmath84 is the binary part of the friction , @xmath85 is the friction due to the coupling of the solute motion to the collective density mode of the solvent and @xmath86 is the contribution to the diffusion ( inverse of friction ) from the current modes of the solvent .    for the present system",
    ", we have neglected the contribution from the current term , @xmath87 which is expected to be reasonable at high density and low temperature .",

    "it should be noted here that the short time dynamics of the density term used in eq.10 , is different from the conventional mode coupling formalism.@xmath114 this prescription has recently been proposed to explain the weak power law mass dependence of the self - diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle.@xmath74 the detailed discussion on this prescription has been given elsewhere.@xmath96    since the solvent is much heavier than the solute , the decay of solvent dynamical variables are naturally much slower than those of the solute . since the decay of @xmath0 is much faster than @xmath111 , in eq .",
    "10 the contribution from the product , @xmath115 mainly governed by the time scale of decay of @xmath0 .",

    "the details of implementing this self - consistent scheme is given elsewhere.@xmath96    we have evaluated the diffusion coefficient @xmath80 by using the above mentioned self - consistent scheme .",
    "the calculated diffusion value was found to be higher than the simulated one .",
    "this may be partly due to the observed faster decay of calculated @xmath0 than the simulated one .",
    "this in turn could be due to the gaussian approximation for @xmath0 which truncates the cumulant expression of @xmath0 beyond the quadratic ( @xmath128 ) term.@xmath129 however , the higher order terms which are the systematic corrections to the gaussian forms can be increasingly important at intermediate times and wave numbers ( @xmath1).@xmath124    therefore , we have performed mct calculations using the _ simulated _",

    "the calculated value of the binary term and the density term contribution to the friction for different values of @xmath20 are presented in table iii .",
    "earlier mode coupling theoretical calculations@xmath135 for small solute was performed by keeping the solute and the solvent mass _ equal_. in those calculations it was found that for size ratio @xmath19 = 5 , the solute motion is primarily determined by the binary collision between the solute and the solvent particles .",
    "it was also shown that due to the decoupling of the solute motion from the structural relaxation of the solvent , the contribution of the density mode of the solvent was much smaller than that of the binary term . in the present calculation",
    "we find that due to smaller mass of the solute , the contribution of the binary term decreases with increase in the solvent mass as is clearly evident from table iii .",
    "when compared to the simulated diffusion values , it is clearly seen from table ii that although the mct qualitatively predicts the diffusion value for @xmath20 = 5 , it breaks down at large values of the mass ratios .",
    "this may be because mct overestimates the friction contribution from the density mode .",
    "this breakdown of the mct for large mass ratio can be connected to its breakdown observed near the glass transition temperature . for large solvent mass , the system is almost frozen and the dynamic structure factor of the solvent decays in a much longer time scale when compared to the solute .",
    "so from the point of view of the solute , it probes an almost quenched system which can be expected to show the behavior very similar to a system , near the glass transition . just as near the glass transition temperature , the hopping mode also plays the dominant role in the diffusion process .",

    ".    however , in a supercooled liquid , this is not the case .",
    "the dynamical heterogeneities observed in a deeply supercooled liquid are often manifested as the magnitude of the deviation of @xmath137 , the so - called non - gaussian parameter , from zero .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath137 deviates more and more strongly and decays more and more slowly with increase in the degree of supercooling.@xmath139 in the present study , a similar behavior has also been observed in @xmath137 ( calculated for the solute ) . the height of the maximum in @xmath137 increases as the mass of the solvent",
    "is increased ( see figure 5 ) , which is clear evidence that the solute probes increasingly heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "it is generally believed that the dominant corrections to the gaussian result are provided by the term containing @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to see whether this term alone is sufficient to explain the observed stretching in @xmath0 of the solute at longer time . in order to quantify this ,",
    "we have plotted in figure 10 the simulated @xmath0 along with the @xmath0 obtained after incorporating the lowest order correction ( @xmath140 term ) to the gaussian approximations for mass ratio , @xmath20 = 50 at the reduced wavenumber @xmath70 . for comparison",
    ", the gaussian approximation to @xmath0 is also shown .",
    "it is clearly seen that the first non - gaussian correction to @xmath0 is not sufficient to describe the long time stretching predicted by the simulation .",
    "this clearly indicate that at the length scales probed by the solute , _ the higher order corrections can not be neglected_. it is the nearly quenched inhomogeneity probed by the solute particles over small length scales which play an important role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "the stretching of @xmath0 observed in simulation could be intimately connected with this nearly quenched inhomogeneity probed by the solute particles .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of this study .",
    "we have investigated by using the molecular dynamics simulation the diffusion of small light particles in a solvent composed of larger massive particles for a fixed solvent - to - solute size ratio ( @xmath19 = 5 ) but with a large variation in mass ratio ( where the mass of the solute is kept constant ) .",
    "in addition , a mode - coupling theory ( mct ) analysis of diffusion is also presented .",
    "it is found that the solute dynamics remain surprisingly coupled to the solvent dynamics even in the limit of highly massive solvent .",
    "most interestingly , with increase in mass ratio , the self - intermediate scattering function of the solute develops a stretching at long time which , for intermediate values of mass ratio , could be fitted to a single stretched exponential function with the stretching exponent , @xmath65 . in the limit of very large mass ratio ,",
    "the existence of two stretched exponential separated by a power law type plateau is observed .",
    "this behavior is found to arise from increasingly heterogeneous environment probed by the solute particle as one increases the mass of the solvent particles .",
    "the mct calculation of self - diffusion is found to agree qualitatively with the simulation results for small mass ratio",
    ". however , it fails to describe the simulated prediction at large mass ratios .",
    "the velocity correlation function of the solute shown interesting oscillatory structure .",
    "several of the results observed here are reminiscent of the relaxation of the self - intermediate scattering function , @xmath0 observed in the deeply supercooled liquid near its glass transition temperature . in that case",
    "also , one often observes combination of power - law and stretched exponential in the decay of the intermediate scattering function .",
    "we find that even the breakdown of mct at large mass ratio could be connected to its breakdown near the glass transition temperature because it is the neglect of the spatial hopping mode of particles which is responsible for the breakdown of mct .",
    "it is to be noted that those hoppings which are mostly ballistic in nature ( after a binary collision ) have already been incorporated in mct .",
    "however , mct does not include the hoppings which involve collective displacement involving several molecules.@xmath23    it should be pointed out that in the mct calculation , we have neglected the contribution of the current term . while the current contribution may improve the agreement between the simulation and mct result for small mass ratio ( @xmath20 = 5 ) , its contribution at larger mass ratio is not expected to change the results significantly , because the discrepancy is very large .    the origin of the power law remains to be investigated in more detail .",
    "our preliminary analysis shows that this may be due to the separation of the time scale between the first weakly stretched exponential ( due to the dispersion in the binary - type interaction term ) and the second , later more strongly stretched exponential ( which is due to the coupling of the solute s motion to the density mode of the slow solvent ) .",
    "this separation arises because these two motions are very different in nature .",
    "however , a quantitative theory of this stretching and power - law is not available at present .",
    "while the origin of the stretching of @xmath0 can be at least qualitatively understood in terms of the inhomogeneity experienced by the solute , the origin of hopping is less clear . in the supercooled",
    "liquid , hopping is found to be correlated with anisotropic local stress@xmath23 which is unlikely in the present system which is at lower density and pressure .",
    "finally we note that the system investigated here is a good candidate to understand qualitative features of relaxation in a large variety of systems , such as concentrated solution of polysaccharide in water and also motion of water in clay .",
