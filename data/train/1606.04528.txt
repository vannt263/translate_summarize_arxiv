    "nearly every moderately massive galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) appears to contain a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at its center , with @xmath12 correlating with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xmath5 , optical luminosity , or stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some active galactic nuclei are rapidly accreting gas at near eddington rates , but most smbhs in the local universe are weakly accreting or quasi - quiescent , like our own milky way . the galactic processes that drive smbh accretion are complex and gas movement within disks is not yet well understood .",
    "however , black hole mass , which necessarily increases through accretion , is well studied across different types of galaxies .",
    "compared to bulge - dominated early - type galaxies , where the bulge accounts for nearly all of the luminosity and stellar mass , late - type galaxies follow a @xmath13 relation with a similar slope ( black hole mass positively correlating with higher velocity dispersion ) but a lower intercept .",
    "the smbhs hosted in spirals are therefore on average less massive by a factor of @xmath142 than in ellipticals at a given @xmath5 @xcite , although some studies do find spirals and ellipticals show consistent trends ( graham & scott ( 2013 ) .",
    "late - type galaxies also offer some disk tracers of smbh mass , such as spiral arm pitch angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and it is now clear that there are bulgeless galaxies with smbhs @xcite .",
    "smbh masses do not appear to correlate with disk or pseudobulge absolute magnitudes @xcite , although see also discussion in lsker et al .",
    "these factors suggest that black hole growth could be tied to galactic gas , and not only to bulge properties .",
    "the rate of major mergers is lower for late - type galaxies than for early - type galaxies ( spiral morphology can be destroyed in major mergers , although gas rich mergers may preserve or regrow disks ; hopkins et al .  2009 ) , so they are less able to activate and significantly grow their smbhs through mergers .",
    "the relationship between smbh growth and activity , and host galaxy evolution is complex ( shankar et al .",
    "cold gas reservoirs could fuel star formation and smbh accretion ( the latter perhaps indirectly , from stellar winds ) and we would observe a positive correlation between smbh accretion rate and cold gass mass . on the other hand , if smbh accretion feedback heats and expels gas and thereby shuts down star formation , we might observe a negative correlation . or , particularly in smaller galaxies with smaller smbhs , timescale mismatches and a limited energy budget may causally decouple these processes . here , we explore the black hole accretion - cold gas mass relationship through investigating how nuclear x - ray luminosities are linked to total hi masses . this work both complements and extends previous studies in that we investigate all detectable smbh activity in nearby , late - type galaxies rather than only known active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ; indeed , the majority of galaxies in our sample do not have optical indicators of nuclear activity .    as also noted for nearby early - type galaxies ,",
    "there is more than sufficient ( hot ) gas near the central regions ( soria et al .",
    "2006 ) to produce observed levels of activity .",
    "that being said , it seems plausible that additional ( cold ) gas , either directly available for smbh accretion or indirectly involved via star formation that then adds mass loss from winds , would increase the accretion rate and consequent x - ray emission .",
    "we might expect that galaxies with larger total hi masses transport more of that cold gas to the central region , and have more active smbhs .",
    "the expected rates of mass accretion for these late - type galaxies correspond to doubling times of tens of gyr , but addressing this question is nonetheless important for understanding smbh growth .",
    "a positive correlation between galaxy - wide hi mass and nuclear x - ray emission might suggest that cold gas is important for activity also in powerful agns . in this context smbh growth",
    "would not need to be self - regulated by feedback but rather would depend on the transport properties ( e.g. , torque - limited accretion ; angles - alcazar et al .",

    "our initial optical selection of the parent sample went out to a distance of 90 mpc .",
    "we examined the detection fraction of x - ray nuclear sources as a function of distance ( figure 4 , left ) to see how deep we could reasonably make our final sample .",

    "the best - fit slope , calculated robustly against outliers , is @xmath52 .",
    "our data therefore show the expected trend that optically brighter and more massive spirals possess more hi gas in absolute terms ( because the slope is @xmath53 ) but have lower gas fractions ( because the slope is @xmath54 ) .",

    "we investigated the nature of galaxies that lie 2@xmath5 above or below the mean .",
    "three galaxies are classified as outliers : ngc 4448 is red , likely a star - forming spiral , ngc 4450 is a cluster galaxy in virgo but otherwise normal , and ngc 7727 is a late - stage merger with tails . each of these characteristics could be responsible for lowering the galaxies gas fractions .",
    "it is interesting that there are no outliers with high gas fractions , while lower than average gas fractions are common for any given @xmath7 .",

    "here we calculated the best - fit trend using the bisector slope since it is not clear which direction the causal relationship , if any , should go ( isobe et al .  1990 ) .",
    "we find a strong correlation , but this is not surprising since @xmath60 is used to calculate @xmath7 , so this is another perspective on the gas fraction trend noted above .",
    "we investigate nuclear x - ray luminosity versus stellar mass and hi mass .",
    "we use the bayesian linear regression code of kelly ( 2007 ) , implemented in idl as linmix_err.pro , to determine the correlation slope and intercept taking both measurement uncertainties and the x - ray upper limits into account .",
    "we report the preferred model parameters as the median of 10000 draws from the posterior distribution , with uncertainties corresponding to @xmath61 from the 16th and 84th percentiles .",
    "for the stellar mass versus nuclear x - ray luminosity , fit as    @xmath62    the best - fit intercept , slope , and intrinsic scatter are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . while the intrinsic scatter is large , there is a highly significant correlation between the variables , in the sense that optically - brighter and more massive spiral galaxies also have greater @xmath2 values .",
    "the slope of @xmath64 is consistent with @xmath66 , which might be expected for bondi accretion where @xmath67 , if the local mass @xmath68 were to scale with the total stellar mass @xmath3 , and further presuming that the black hole mass @xmath12 were a fixed fraction of @xmath7 and that @xmath2 scales with @xmath69 .",
    "a slope of @xmath70 , corresponding to a uniform eddington ratio under these assumptions , seems ruled out for our spirals .",
    "since these assumptions may not hold  in particular , the local gas supply may not be closely linked to the overall galaxy gas content  we refrain from drawing particular conclusions from the best - fit slope .    for the hi mass versus nuclear x - ray luminosity ,",

    "further , the residuals of @xmath77 show no trend with @xmath6 .",
    "this contrasts with the residuals for @xmath78 which still do show a trend with @xmath7 ( figure 6 , bottom panels ) .",

    "the slopes for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , similar to fitting the full final sample .",
    "directly fitting @xmath2 as a function of both distance and @xmath7 gives slopes of @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; there is no significant direct dependence upon distance .    finally , we used non - parametric methods to test for correlations as a complementary check to our regression analysis .",

    "these results are all consistent with the previous analysis and discussion .",
    "an important caveat is that it is difficult to eliminate the chance of high - mass x - ray binary contamination in late - type galaxies , even with the outstanding angular resolution of _ chandra _ ( but see , e.g. , jenkins et al .",

    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) have a luminosity function that scales with stellar mass ( gilfanov 2004 ) , whereas high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) have a luminosity function that scales with star formation rate ( grimm et al .",
    "this is because lmxbs are fed by roche - lobe overflow from their low - mass long - lived companion star whereas hmxbs also accrete from the winds of their high - mass short - lived companion star .",

    "note that this is for the hard 210 kev band ; to convert to the full 0.57 kev band over which the csc fluxes for our sources are measured , we add 0.11 dex to @xmath94 ( determined using pimms for a power - law spectrum with @xmath95=1.7 for a typical column density of @xmath96  @xmath97 ) .",
    "we conservatively calculate @xmath94 within a 2@xmath29 aperture centered on the galaxy , since the matching radius for nuclear _ chandra _ sources is 2@xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the star formation throughout the galaxy follows the total light ; this is also conservative as these late - type galaxies tend to have bulges redder than the disks .",
    "rather than modeling the surface brightness profile for each individual galaxy , we use a template to determine what fraction of the total @xmath7 and sfr ( and hence what fraction of the @xmath94 ) is contained within 2@xmath29 as a function of distance .",
    "the galaxy we select as a template is ngc 3344 which has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( all near the median values of our final sample ) , and is nearby at @xmath10110  mpc .",
    "we extract the optical surface brightness within circular radial apertures ( avoiding foreground stars ) and model the disk plus bulge as separate sersic profile components ( ciotti & bertin 1999 ) with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . the scaling factor for @xmath94 based on this",
    "template changes smoothly from 13% to 61% at distances from 5 to 50 mpc ; it may be parameterized as @xmath104 with d in mpc .",
    "a galaxy - by - galaxy approach would provide some increase in accuracy but using a template to calculate the fractional scaling suffices for our statistical investigation .",
    "a histogram of expected values of @xmath105 within 2@xmath29 is provided in figure 7 , along with the measured nuclear x - ray luminosities for our galaxies .",

    "those values are given in table  1 . because most of the nuclear x - ray luminosities are greater than those typically reached by lmxbs or even hmxbs , and because the _ chandra _ psf out to our adopted distance limit only encloses the central region of each galaxy , most x - ray detections are secure .",

    ", we fit the sample 20 different times and probabilistically vary whether each x - ray source is treated as a detection or a limit . for example , a nuclear x - ray source with @xmath115 and a probability that this is due to the smbh rather than lmxbs or hmxbs of 0.7 is treated as a detection in 70% of the fits and as a limit in the remaining 30% .",
    "the results of these 20 fits are shown in figure 8 for the fit of @xmath2 as a joint function of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in all cases ,",
    "the slopes show a significant dependance on @xmath116 and not on @xmath6 , and the preferred values are also within the uncertainties from the previous fit treating all detections as uncontaminated .",
    "we conclude that our results are robust against typical lmxb and hmxb binary contamination .              in figure  9",
    ", top left panel , we show the relationship between residual nuclear x - ray luminosity ( i.e. , after removing the dependence on stellar mass , so @xmath9 ) as a function of galaxy size .",
    "galaxy size is calculated from the apparent diameter corrected for galactic extinction and inclination effects , as taken from the hyperleda database , and converted to physical size for the distances given in table  1 .",
    "presuming a uniform surface brightness profile for our spiral galaxies ( clearly incorrect but acceptable to first order for the scaling arguments considered here ) , galaxy size is a multiplicative constant times the effective radius .",
    "there appears to be a possible tendency for more compact galaxies to be relatively more x - ray luminous , but when we quantified this trend by fitting a linear regression model using the linmix_err.pro idl routine we found that the slope was not significantly different from zero .",
    "it would be interesting to revisit this point with a larger sample .",
    "we also tested for a potential relationship between the central velocity dispersion ( again from hyperleda ) and residual nuclear x - ray luminosity , as shown in the top central panel of figure  9 , and here too we do not find any significant correlation .",
    "finally , we consider the size multiplied by the square of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for the virial mass , as shown in the top right panel of figure  9 ; here too we do not find any significant correlation .",
    "we note that @xmath2 might still scale with any of these variables separately but if they in turn scale with @xmath7 then removing that dependence leaves no trend . finally , in the bottom panels of figure  9 , we again plot residual nuclear x - ray luminosity against the galaxy size , central stellar velocity , and virial mass proxy , but now correct these too for their dependence on stellar mass .",
    "there is a possible tendency for galaxies that have larger residual central stellar velocity dispersions or virial masses , at a given stellar mass , to also have relatively larger residual nuclear x - ray luminosities .",
    "smbhs in local galaxies correlate mostly with stellar velocity dispersion rather than stellar mass ( shankar et al .",
    "2016 ) , and larger values of central stellar velocity dispersion may indicate larger smbhs ( at a given stellar mass ) and hence greater x - ray luminosity at a given eddington ratio .",
    "we investigate the smbh duty cycles for low and high @xmath7 bins , through measuring the fraction of galaxies with @xmath2 greater than 40 in a particular @xmath7 range .",
    "we calculate the fraction of galaxies with @xmath117 in the 9.3  10.3 @xmath3 bin to be 5/67 = 7.5% and the fraction of galaxies with @xmath117 in the 10.3  11.3 @xmath7 bin to be 18/62 = 29% .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with @xmath117 within the entire sample is 23/129 = 17.8% .",
    "this is robust to potential xrb contamination because the probabilities that the nuclear x - ray emission is associated with a smbh are @xmath118 for our galaxies with @xmath47 .    for our sample of late - type galaxies",
    ", we use the m - sigma relationship given in gultekin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to calculate black hole masses and compare to @xmath7 : log(@xmath119)=8.12 + 4.24@xmath120/200 km / s ) .",
    "we find on average @xmath121 and use this to estimate black hole mass for our sources without measured sigma . the bins of 9.310.3 @xmath7 and 10.311.3 @xmath7 then correspond to bins of 6.17.1 @xmath12 and 7.18.1 @xmath12 .",
    "for comparison , goulding et al .",
    "( 2010 ) use mid - ir selection techniques to calculate an agn fraction of about 20% in their sample of nearby galaxies with black hole masses similar to ours ; see their figure  5 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with our x - ray estimate of the fraction of smbhs accreting at @xmath117 .",
    "the late - type galaxies studied here have detected nuclear x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath122 . for a typical smbh of a few million solar masses , achieving @xmath123 with a radiative efficiency of @xmath124 only requires @xmath125  m@xmath126  yr@xmath23 .",
    "these include seyfert agns as well as formally inactive galaxies ; our sample probes smbhs across a continuum of low - level accretion rates .",
    "we were able to use indicators at a number of wavelengths to distinguish smbh activity from other potential sources of x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray , optical and radio emissions can be used to probe this .",
    "first , several galaxies are known seyferts or liners or have variable x - ray emission , which again improves the chances that we are probing smbh - linked activity rather than high - mass x - ray binary contamination .",
    "seyferts have strong optical features of agn activity that include strong emission lines as well as absorption lines from the host galaxy .",
    "seyferts 1 and 2 are thought to be the same objects seen from different vantage points .",
    "seyfert 1s have broadened emission lines while seyfert 2s do not because of our viewing angle .",
    "liners have spectral features that could result from either low - level agn activity or star formation .    table 1 shows optical indicators of black hole activity for selected sources under the activity column .",
    "several galaxies , including a high fraction of the seyferts , also have a central continuum 1.4 ghz point source vla detection ( ho & ulvestad 2001 ; also vla first survey data ; becker et al .",
    "radio detections serve as a signpost of smbh activity because , in the fundamental plane ( e.g. , merloni et al .",
    "2003 ) , the radio luminosity one expects is a function of the x - ray luminosity and the smbh mass . while x - ray binaries have radio emission , at a given x - ray luminosity , a 10 solar mass xrb will have a much weaker radio luminosity than a million solar mass smbh .",
    "star formation processes and supernovae remnants can also produce radio sources , albeit spread throughout the external galaxy rather than centralized ( note the typical angular resolution of these vla maps is @xmath145@xmath29 ) , but even compared to hmxbs supernova remnants have short lifetimes of a few hundred thousand years when they are radio bright .",
    "the average x - ray luminosities of the galaxies identified as seyferts or liners are larger than those not classified as such in ned .",
    "the detection fraction for seyferts and liners is 92% ( 34/37 ) compared to 43% for optically inactive galaxies , and 79% of those detections ( 27/34 ) have @xmath108 .",
    "taking x - ray limits into account using asurv ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) , seyferts and liners have a ( kaplan - meier ) mean @xmath127 compared to optically inactive galaxies at @xmath128 , and two - sample tests indicate probabilities of @xmath55 that our samples of seyferts and liners versus optically inactive galaxies have the same underlying @xmath2 distribution .",
    "similar results hold when normalizing @xmath2 by @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the optically inactive galaxies hosting smbhs accreting at a lower rate than in the seyferts and liners .    at the same time , the gas fractions of these seyfert and liner galaxies are similar to ( if anything perhaps slightly lower than ) those of optically inactive galaxies at matched @xmath7 values .",
    "we checked this by drawing a random subsample without consideration of gas fraction from the optically inactive galaxies weighted to match the @xmath7 distribution of the seyferts and liners ( achieving good agreement in @xmath7 after weighting ; ks test probability @xmath129 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath7 matched subsample of non - seyferts has a distribution of gas fractions that is consistent with the seyferts ( ks test @xmath130 ) .",
    "this also suggests that smbh accretion rates are not dependent on galaxy - wide gas fractions alone .",
    "our fits test for a relationship between black hole accretion rate and hi content .",
    "since cold gas is available for star formation , we might expect a positive trend based on the correlation between star formation rate and agn fraction found by rafferty et al .",
    "on the other hand , fabello et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) find that bulge properties and smbh accretion rate are not linked to hi gas in blue galaxies ( although they do appear to correlate in red galaxies ) .",
    "specifically , the gas fraction in galaxies that host agns does not differ from that in a matched comparison sample of galaxies , or depend on the /@xmath12 accretion indicator ( fabello et al .",
    "our results are consistent with this finding , to the extent that x - ray luminosities provide a complementary ( if not entirely overlapping ) view of nuclear activity .",
    "the lack of a strong dependence of @xmath131 upon @xmath6 in our analysis suggests that the galaxy - wide cold gas does not directly influence low - level supermassive black hole activity in these spirals .",
    "we also investigated the relationship between the presence of bar features ( barred spirals ) and the hi and x - ray luminosities .",
    "a bar provides grativational torque and is believed to funnel gas down to the central regions of the galaxy by decreasing its angular momentum ( e.g. , shlosman et al .",
    "1990 ) , so we might expect barred galaxies to have greater nuclear @xmath2 values at a given hi mass .",
    "we identified barred galaxies using the classification in ned , as given in table  1 . from our 132 late - type galaxies , only 8 lack bar classifications in ned ; 34 have no bar ( type a ) , 39 are conclusively barred ( type b ) , and 51 have intermediate or weak bar ( type ab ) .",
    "we do not find any significant difference in the average nuclear x - ray luminosities of late - type galaxies with versus without bars . specifically , barred galaxies have a ( kaplan - meier ) mean @xmath132 compared to non - barred galaxies at @xmath133 , and two - sample tests are consistent ( @xmath134 ) with these samples having the same underlying @xmath2 distribution .",
    "( weakly barred galaxies have @xmath135 and are also consistent with non - barred galaxies . )",
    "this suggests that bars may not channel a significant amount of gas directly into the black hole or alternatively perhaps that there is a balance between feeding and accretion .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous findings of zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that barred galaxies do not have greater nuclear x - ray luminosities than non - barred galaxies ; if anything , those authors find that strongly barred galaxies tend to be x - ray faint .",
    "this might also be related to the results from masters et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that barred galaxies are generally less gas - rich , perhaps because the bar concentrates gas in the galactic center where it is rapidly consumed in star formation .",
    "we also investigate the potential difference in x - ray luminosity between interacting and non - interacting galaxies .",
    "the nuclear x - ray detection fraction is 13/19 ( 68% ) for galaxies flagged as `` multiple '' in hyperleda , and 62/110 ( 56% ) for the rest .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity for detected interacting / merging galaxies is @xmath136 and average x - ray luminosity for the non - interacting detected galaxies is @xmath137 .",
    "perhaps because we do not have a large number of interacting galaxies in our sample , the difference in detection fractions and average x - ray luminosity is suggestive but not formally significant .",
    "koss et al .  ( 2011 ) found that hard x - ray detected agn at @xmath138 exhibit a higher fraction of mergers .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to low - level smbh activity in early - type galaxies .",
    "ellipticals also show a trend in nuclear @xmath2 with @xmath7 ( pellegrini 2010 ; gallo et al .  2010 ) , with an apparent enhancement in scaled @xmath2 for galaxies in sparser large - scale environments ( miller et al .",
    "a comparison of our sample of late - type galaxies to the early - type galaxies in the amuse project ( gallo et al .",
    "2010 ; miller et al .",
    "2012 ) indicates that the ellipticals tend toward lower values of @xmath2 at a given @xmath7 ( see figure  10 ) , and the correlation has a flatter slope .",
    "since galaxies with a particular @xmath2 value can have a wide range of stellar masses , it seems likely that there is a wide range in smbh accretion rates and/or efficiencies in these weakly active systems . because early - type galaxies in the field have more hi than their cluster counterparts ( grossi et al .",
    "2009 ; oosterloo et al .",
    "2010 ) , if still notably less in absolute terms than do late - type galaxies , this suggests that cold gas does play a role in nuclear activity .",
    "an analysis of dust features ( from hst maps ) or co emission ( from iram ) in early - type galaxies finds that the presence of dust or co is associated with higher eddington ratios ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) , but that there is no correlation between the co mass and the eddington ratio ( hodges - kluck et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this is consistent with our findings for late - type galaxies that the total amount of galaxy - wide gas on kpc scales does not directly set the smbh accretion on pc scales , but supports the importance of cold gas as a contributing element to smbh growth .",
    "it also aligns with sabater et al .",
    "( 2015 ) finding that large - scale environment and galaxy mergers are not directly responsible for agn activity , but central cold gas supply feeds the smbh through secular processes , and with lamassa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) finding that central sfr correlates with agn activity .    in summary ,",
    "this work tests the hypothesis that more cold gas in a galaxy leads to more accretion onto the central smbh , on average ; we find that this is not supported , after accounting for the effect of galactic stellar mass .",
    "this implies that the mechanisms that directly supply smbhs with gas near the galactic center do not know or care about the total available gas throughout the galaxy .",
    "a lack of correlation between galaxy - wide hi mass and nuclear x - ray emission suggests that the central @xmath1450 pc are most relevant for smbh feeding and that the local gas supply is only loosely linked to the outskirts .",
    "future high angular resolution observations of the gas content and dynamics in the imminent vicinity of the smbh , for example conducted with alma , could help establish a link between local cold gas and smbh activity .",
