    "while the broad emission - line region ( belr ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) remains an enigma , in recent years there has been considerable focus on radiation line driven and magneto hydrodynamic driven winds from an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a key component .",
    "the existence of such winds has been demonstrated for accretion disks in cataclysmic variable star systems and hydrodynamic simulations show that the phenomenon scales to the much larger quasar black hole masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the detailed gas and kinematic structure of the wind remains uncertain .",
    "this is an acute problem , which is important to our understanding of black hole growth and its influence on the evolution of the host galaxy , especially if such winds are a significant source of agn `` feedback '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most important / most common wind diagnostic is the emission - line blueshift @xcite , which we have studied for a large sample of quasars @xcite and in the context of the narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) class @xcite .",
    "specifically , high - ionization emission lines , like  @xmath01549 are found to peak at wavelengths blueward of their expected laboratory wavelength when referenced to low ionization lines ( which are more indicative of the quasar systemic redshift ; e.g. , @xcite ) . as far back as the early 1980s ,",
    "this `` blueshift '' had been suggested as the signature of an outflow @xcite . while the exact physical origin of this blueshift is not agreed upon @xcite",
    ", one possibility is that it is related to the strength of the radiation pressure compared with the black hole mass and is sensitive to the eddington accretion rate @xcite",
    ". it may be that nls1s are the low - luminosity , local analogues of large civ blueshift quasars . if the typically steep hard - band photon indices of nls1s ( @xmath4 ) are signatures of high eddington accretion rates @xcite , then the same might be the case for large civ blueshift quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since a high accretion rate for a given mass is expected to be more conducive to wind driving through radiation pressure on spectral lines @xcite .",
    "indeed , the common link between large  blueshift quasars , broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ; @xcite ) , and traditionally defined nls1s @xcite is likely a strong radiation - pressure driven wind as all three categories exhibit wind features in emission and/or absorption @xcite and may tend toward high @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the premise of a radiation line driven wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is fairly simple and has applications to quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the integrated opacity in ultra - violet ( uv ) bound - bound transitions accelerates gas as photons at specific wavelengths are scattered by ions in the gas .",
    "as the gas velocity increases , the doppler shift makes photons in new wavelength ranges able to contribute to the acceleration .",
    "this process allows a large amount of momentum to be extracted from continuum and emission - line photons , thus driving an outflow from the accretion disk . for this process to work",
    ", the quasar must reduce its x - ray continuum such that the ions which absorb in the uv are not destroyed by over - ionization . to some extent , we know that outflows driven at least in part by radiation pressure must be occurring in balqsos because we see large equivalent width absorption troughs where both energy and momentum have been removed from the continuum @xcite .    in this paper , we follow - up on the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using sdss quasars at @xmath1 where the presence of  emission in the optical provides a powerful diagnostic of accretion disk physics .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that a number of different emission - line features were consistent with a two - component disk+wind model of the belr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "emission - line features suggestive of a weaker than average ionizing spectrum ( relative to the uv ) were found in quasars with weak , highly blueshifted  emission . on the other hand , quasars with emission - line features that indicate a strong ionizing spectrum",
    "were found to have very strong  emission lines at the systemic redshift .",
    "these extrema can be crudely categorized respectively as being dominated by a `` wind '' component and by a `` disk '' component of the belr , although it seems that both components may be present in all objects . while some of the differences seen in the belr are likely derived from intrinsic differences in the spectral energy distribution ( sed",
    "; e.g. , a large _ intrinsic _ uv to x - ray flux ratio is needed to produce a strong radiation line driven wind ; @xcite ) , processing of the ionizing continuum _ through _ the wind can have a significant affect on the emission - line features that arise within the disk component @xcite . here",
    "we explore the x - ray properties of quasars ( such as the optical / uv to x - ray flux ratio , @xmath6 ) over the full range of  properties to see if the evidence that the extrema in  emission - line properties traces extrema in the ionizing continuum is consistent with the x - ray properties of quasars .",
    "while our work focuses specifically on the  emission line , our results should be viewed in the context of the broader `` eigenvector 1 ( ev1 ) '' literature that stemmed from the ground - breaking work of @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a full review of this literature , but a newcomer to the field would be well served by a review of @xcite and @xcite and references therein ; table  2 in the latter nicely summarizes a broad range of correlated emission and continuum properties of quasars .",
    "while much of the ev1 work is founded in low - redshift quasars and investigations of optical emission lines , investigations that bridge the gap to high - redshift quasars and uv emission lines include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "many of the selection criteria used are common to all samples and are summarized here . in general , we have limited ourselves to quasars included in the @xcite quasar catalog from the 7th data release ( dr7 ; @xcite ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) such that we can make use of the sdss spectroscopy of these sources .",
    "the exception is for some pg / bqs @xcite quasars where there exists space - based uv spectra of the  region .",
    "we use the rest - frame  eqw and  blueshift as our main diagnostics .",
    "we have chosen not to include the commonly - used  fwhm measurement in our analysis as that parameter is difficult to interpret in the disk+wind model of the  emission region that we have adopted in @xcite .",
    "this concern is supported by the work of @xcite , who found that  has contributions from both an outflowing and a gravitationally bound component ( the relative contributions of which may be dependent on the eddington ratio ) .",
    "@xcite showed that  fwhm provides a biased estimator of the black hole mass , but argued that this bias can be calibrated out in the ensemble average .",
    "except for the pg quasars , we matched the objects to the database that we used in @xcite and extracted our own values for the  line parameters and corrected sdss redshifts as given by @xcite .",
    "balqsos and radio - loud ( rl ) quasars were excluded as the former are known to be absorbed in the x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we further excluded objects with error codes as noted in the papers below .",

    "the sources showed significant flux variability of @xmath4952% , @xmath5026% , and @xmath5045% , respectively .",
    "while the @xmath51 values between epochs were consistent within the 1@xmath52 error bars , the low counts in the individual spectra could obscure significant spectral variability as well .",
    "combined fitting of the new and old data together was inconclusive ( in terms of the presence of absorption ) , likely because of the substantial variability between epochs .",
    "the key results from @xcite and @xcite were to provide a bridge between properties of the broad emission lines in quasars with their spectral energy distributions . with this in mind , we further consider the x - ray properties of the heterogeneous data set described above .",
    "we specifically consider the distributions of @xmath6 , @xmath21 , and @xmath53  in the  eqw - blueshift parameter space as defined by @xcite .",
    "if the differences seen across the range of  emission - line properties are indicative of a range of abilities to drive a strong accretion disk wind , and if radiation line driving plays a significant role in driving such a wind , then we might expect to see differences in x - ray properties of quasars across the  eqw - blueshift parameter space .",
    "ultimately , our hope is that this work is a first step toward improving the effective resolution of quasar seds in the `` unseen '' part of the continuum that covers nearly two decades in frequency between the optical and the x - ray .      in a disk - wind picture , quasars with radiation - pressure dominated winds should be _ intrinsically _ x - ray weak relative to the optical / uv and are likely to display x - ray warm absorbers @xcite that may _ additionally _ reduce the soft x - ray flux along our line of sight .",
    "our working hypothesis is that an object s location in the  eqw - blueshift parameter space reflects its intrinsic ability to drive a strong accretion disk wind . assuming that radiation line driving dominates the wind component , we expect to see a reduction in @xmath6  across the  eqw - blueshift parameter space ( from top left to bottom right in figure  [ fig : distribution ] ) as the hypothetical wind strength increases .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  7 ) , for evidence of this behavior in nls1s .",
    "figure  [ fig : aoxhist ] gives the range of @xmath6  values in the sample , while figure  [ fig : aox ] shows how @xmath6  changes across the  eqw - blueshift parameter space using two different diagnostics .",
    "first we show the location of the individual quasars in our heterogeneous sample color - coded by @xmath6  ( circles ) as indicated by the color - bar on the right - hand side .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the divisions used in @xcite to create composite spectra as a function of  emission - line properties ( see also section  [ sec : seds ] ) .",
    "there appears to be a general trend towards more negative @xmath6  values ( objects relatively weaker in the x - ray ) from the top - left to the lower - right .",
    "however , as there is considerable scatter in the diagram , we also bin the results to better discern the general trend .",
    "specifically the colored squares indicate the median values of  eqw and blueshift after sorting the values of @xmath6  and grouping them into 10 bins .",
    "although the median values span a much smaller range in  properties than the raw sample , they clearly reveal a general trend towards x - ray weaker objects in the lower right - hand corner .",
    "further evidence for a trend in @xmath6  with  properties comes from performing a student s @xmath54-test for different means ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the objects in the upper - left and lower - right regions of the  parameter space in figure  [ fig : aox ] . we find that the mean values for @xmath6  in those bins are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , with a standard deviation of @xmath57 , yielding a @xmath54 value of @xmath58 with very high significance that the samples have different means .",
    "this trend of decreasing relative x - ray strength as we move from the upper - left ( large eqw , small blueshift ) to the lower - right ( small eqw , large blueshift ) in figure  [ fig : aox ] is consistent with the expectations of a model of the belr where a radiation line driven wind is influencing the properties of .",
    "when the x - ray flux is high , a strong radiation line driven wind can not form ( though perhaps there is still an mhd - driven wind ; @xcite ) and the ionizing continuum photons can create a large population of triply ionized carbon atoms in the outer part of the accretion disk . if instead , the x - ray flux is weaker , a strong radiation line driven wind can form , shielding the outer accretion disk from an already weaker x - ray flux . in this case",
    "the  line is formed mostly in the wind itself and may be blueshifted due to the outflowing nature of the source and lower in equivalent width due to the overall reduction in ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "it is less clear what is happening in the lower - left corner ( small eqw , and small blueshifts ) , but it would appear that those objects have more heterogeneous @xmath6  values than the objects in the upper - left or lower - right corners .",
    "third parameters , such as covering fraction , orientation , absorption , and/or variability effects could explain objects in the lower left - hand corner ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; bowler , allen , & hewett , in preparation ) .",
    "as noted in @xcite , objects with both large  blueshift and large  eqw do not seem to exist and this is unlikely to be a selection effect .",
    "our results are consistent with the results of @xcite who have done a multivariate regression of eqw against both @xmath19 and @xmath6 .",
    "they find that  eqw correlates with @xmath6  such that harder spectra have stronger .",
    "what our work does is to further separate low eqw objects in another dimension .",
    "while there is no degeneracy for large eqw quasars , those with smaller  eqw values can have a range of  blueshifts . since @xmath6  is also correlated with  blueshift ( in a way that is not trivially related to the  eqw )",
    ", it is important to explore trends in @xmath6  in this 2-d parameter space .    student s t results : aox t = 9.85303744323 significance = 1.0071271342e-16 mean and s_d values : aox bin 1 mean : -1.49680769231 bin 8 mean : -1.70046551724 s_d : 0.0206695474474      as it is well known that @xmath6  is correlated with uv luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the above trends with @xmath6  in the previous section might instead be ascribed to luminosity .",
    "indeed , we find that uv luminosity is increasing from the upper - left to the lower - right in figure  1 . as such",
    ", it has become common to reference @xmath6  values to the mean @xmath6  values observed for objects with the same uv luminosity according to @xmath60 .",
    "here we adopt the expected value of @xmath6  from @xcite , specifically @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath59 indicates the relative amount of x - ray emission , whereby negative values of @xmath59 indicate a relative deficit of x - rays , while positive values indicate an x - ray surplus .",
    "figure  [ fig : daoxhist ] shows the distribution of @xmath21  values in our sample .    by using @xmath21  instead of @xmath6",
    ", luminosity is marginalized and any remaining sed effects must instead be due to the _ shape _ of the sed rather than its absolute value .",
    "it is therefore significant that figure  [ fig : daox ] shows the same general trend as does figure  [ fig : aox ] . while taking out the luminosity dependence has apparently reduced the trend for individual objects , the median values of  eqw and blueshift ( using 10 bins sorted in @xmath21 ) again show a significant trend from more x - ray luminous objects in the upper left - hand corner to relatively weaker x - ray sources in the lower right - hand corner .",
    "@xcite similarly find that low eqw objects and large blueshift objects have more negative values of @xmath21  ( their figures 8 and 10 ) , although it should be noted that half of our sample comes from their paper , so our results are not independent .",
    "as with @xmath6 , a student s @xmath54-test confirms that the mean values of @xmath21  in the upper - left and lower - right parts of the  distribution in figure  [ fig : daox ] are significantly different .",
    "we find respective mean values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 with a standard deviation of @xmath57 , yielding @xmath64 with high significance .",
    "unfortunately our understanding of the x - ray sed data is in roughly the same state as our understanding of the optical / uv sed was in the 1990s .",
    "@xcite were able to establish that the optical / uv spectral index was @xmath65 with an error of @xmath66 ; however , it was nt until @xcite that the photometric errors were small enough that the @xmath67 distribution could be shown to have an intrinsic spread rather than a single characteristic value smeared by measurement errors .",
    "in the case of the x - ray , variability likely plays more of a role than measurement errors especially since both the optical and x - ray measurements are subject to changes over time and are non - simultaneous .",
    "indeed , the majority of the width in the @xmath21  distribution can be attributed to variability @xcite .",
    "the width of the @xmath21  distribution notwithstanding , there does appear to be a trend towards relatively weaker x - ray sources in objects with large  blueshifts .",
    "while the @xmath6  and @xmath21  trends with  eqw and blueshift are expected in a radiation line driven wind model , we have less intuition regarding how the x - ray spectral indices ( @xmath68 ) should behave . at low redshift ,",
    "where x - ray data sample the soft x - ray part of the spectrum , it is observed that @xmath69 correlates with the strength of ( relative to h@xmath70 ) and anti - correlates with the fwhm of h@xmath70 @xcite ; x - ray softer objects thus have stronger and narrower h@xmath70 @xcite . in the context of black hole binaries ,",
    "such soft - spectrum objects ( including nls1s ; @xcite ) are thought to have high accretion rates @xcite .",

    "data on  for low-@xmath34 quasars , @xcite have shown that large blueshift objects tend towards softer @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath3 values tabulated here ( fig .  [ fig : gammahist ] ) generally refer to the harder part of the x - ray spectrum from 2kev to 10kev , so it does not necessarily follow that large blueshift objects should tend towards softer @xmath71 ; however , that does seem to be the case .",
    "if higher uv luminosity results in more compton cooling of the corona , then one indeed might expect @xmath71 to follow @xmath69 @xcite and that quasars with large blueshift might have high accretion rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] shows a weak trend of increasing ( softer ) @xmath3 with increasing blueshift and decreasing  eqw . as with the @xmath6  and @xmath21  figures the median  properties as a function of @xmath3 show a clearer trend than can be discerned from looking at the distribution of individual objects .",
    "we find a student s @xmath54 of @xmath72 with significance of @xmath73 , showing that there is a clear difference when comparing the means of objects in the top - left ( @xmath74 ) and the lower - right ( @xmath75 ) parts of figure  [ fig : gamma ] ; the standard deviation is @xmath76 . clearly further work is needed to better understand whether the the harder @xmath3 values for strong  quasars are indicative of the intrinsic x - ray spectrum .",
    "the values of @xmath6 , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 are perhaps more meaningful within the context of the overall sed . as such , in figure  [ fig : sed ] we create typical seds spanning the  eqw - blueshift bins used by @xcite ; the  properties of each sed are shown in figure  [ fig : sedpos ] . for this analysis , we imposed a @xmath77 limit such that both  and are observed and a uv spectral index between the continua underlying those lines could be determined empirically .",
    "the seds were created using the _ median _ values of l@xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 for each sub - sample , where the first two quantities were taken from our own work and the last two quantities were taken from the literature as described above ( with the exception of our new _",

    "then @xmath53 was used to plot a point at @xmath84 .",
    "in addition to our optical and x - ray results , we have included the uv results of @xcite who found that the uv spectral index over @xmath856501100  is a function of luminosity .",
    "specifically , we have used the results of table  4 and figure  18 from @xcite and our value of @xmath86 ( as a proxy for @xmath87 used by @xcite ) to estimate the spectral slope over @xmath88 [ @xmath89})>15.39 $ ] ] .",
    "the luminosity dependences of @xmath40 and @xmath6  appear to be fairly comparable as the break at 500  is difficult to discern , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that there is little information on the shape of the sed between 500  and @xmath90kev for luminous quasars ; @xmath6  only parametrizes the uv to x - ray flux ratio , not the actual shape of the sed , which has implications for bolometric corrections ; see section  [ sec : bc ] .",
    "interestingly , those objects that are relatively stronger at 2kev relative to 2500 ( i.e. , have a harder ionizing spectrum ) are also apparently harder ( i.e. , flatter ) over 210kev",
    ".    although the differences between the seds are subtle , the effects are clearly systematic .",
    "relative to their 2500  luminosities , the large  eqw objects have `` harder '' seds than the large  blueshift objects .",
    "we illustrate this more clearly in the inset of figure  [ fig : sed ] by normalizing all of the seds to the same 2500  luminosity .",
    "it is important to realize that while the @xmath6  distribution for these sdss quasars nowhere near spans the extrema as characterized by the weak - lined quasar phl 1811 ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy re 1034 + 39 ( @xmath92 ; @xcite ) , nevertheless , for the same uv luminosity , a change in @xmath6  of just @xmath93 corresponds to a change in flux at 2kev of a factor of 3 .",
    "this difference is simply a reflection of the large lever arm between 2500  and 2kev ( 2.6 decades in frequency ) .",
    "as such it is not unreasonable to expect significant differences in the ability of quasars to drive a wind through radiation line pressure as we move across the  eqw - blueshift parameter space .      since there are few _ empirical _ constraints on the 500  to 0.2kev part of the sed , it is useful to compare our empirical seds to some example model seds .",
    "we specifically consider model seds similar to those described in @xcite in accordance with the agn spectrum in the cloudy package @xcite .",
    "the optical / uv portion of the sed is modeled as a power law with exponential cutoffs at high and low energies as parametrized by a cutoff temperature ( the temperature of the inner edge of the accretion disk for the high energy cutoff ) .",
    "the optical spectral index is taken to be @xmath94 and the x - ray spectral index is fixed to @xmath95 . the optical / uv part of the spectrum is related to the x - ray part of the spectrum by the well - known @xmath27@xmath6  relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that , in this model , there is a degeneracy between @xmath96 , @xmath27 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 that means that the seds are uniquely described by a single parameter that can be characterized by @xmath6 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bb ] we show a model sed ( solid black line ) that best represents the average quasar in our sample .",
    "two examples that are meant to bracket the range of seds spanned by our  sample ( in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath6 ) are also shown .",
    "the two extreme seds shown have cutoff temperatures of 20ev and 50ev and have , respectively , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath101 of 31.8 and 30.0 .",
    "as noted by @xcite , such model seds with very `` hot '' accretion disks are apparently inconsistent with the uv part of empirical seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the extreme models shown in figure  [ fig : bb ] have spectral indices of @xmath102 and @xmath103 at 800 , respectively , which are within the range observed by @xcite , but are too blue / hard for these luminosities as can be seen by comparison with our empirical seds ( dotted lines ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that the sed the emission - line gas sees may not be the same as the sed that we see @xcite and our work herein and in @xcite might be taken as further evidence of such a situation . if both the observer and the emitting gas _ do _ see the same sed then , if this model parametrization is accurate , our empirical data would suggest that a lower cutoff temperature might be more appropriate for the luminous quasars in our sample .",
    "we are currently pursuing a more detailed characterization of the near - uv part of the spectrum for sdss quasars ( krawczyk et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "aside from the near - uv slope mismatch , the 20ev peaked spectrum is representative of the most luminous quasars in our sample ( in terms of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the relatively soft spectrum ( x - ray weak relative to uv ) would be conducive to driving a strong wind through radiation line driving , yielding a large  blueshift .",
    "on the other hand , the 50ev peaked spectrum is more representative of the less luminous quasars in our sample .",
    "for such quasars , the relatively hard spectrum is more likely to overionize the accretion disk atmosphere and has less uv flux , both of which would tend to inhibit a radiation line driven wind .",
    "this harder sed is one that we associate with quasars that have strong  emission that is dominated by the disk component of the belr .",
    "although there is a lack of data to characterize the shape of the sed over much of the crucial ionizing part of the spectrum , our model seds represent extrema characterizing the ionizing sed for a given @xmath6  ( c.f .",
    ", the simple power - law model , dotted lines in figure  [ fig : bb ] ) in that they have as much far - uv flux as one could imagine .",
    "thus , these extrema are particularly interesting to consider in terms of bolometric corrections ; see section  [ sec : bc ] .",
    "an intermediate model might be one that has a cooler accretion disk with a comptonized extension to soft x - ray energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with another , hotter comptonized region producing the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "for example , even if the accretion disk is not as hot as depicted by the models in figure  [ fig : bb ] , @xcite suggest that quasars with strong ( which tend to have strong  at the systemic redshift ; @xcite ) would require a factor of a few higher flux at @xmath104ev than most empirical seds ( including ours ) would suggest .",

    "we find that the @xcite objects are generally in the upper - left of the  parameter space ( i.e. , they tend to have large eqw and small blueshift , which , ironically , suggest that soft excess objects are actually x - ray hard [ relative to the uv ] ) .",
    "although the @xcite objects are much less luminous than the average quasars in our sample ( @xmath105 ) , they are actually well matched to the lowest luminosity ( and generally hard - spectrum ) objects of our sample ( being bright objects at low redshift as opposed to faint objects at high redshift ) .",
    "as such , it would be valuable to explore the possibility of correlations between the  properties of quasars and the presence of a soft x - ray excess .",
    "we specifically predict that the average high - luminosity , high-@xmath34 quasar does not have an x - ray soft excess based on the relative locations in the 2d  parameter space of low-@xmath34 soft excess objects .",

    "a lack of such a strong soft x - ray excess in luminous quasars would mean that while @xmath6  may accurately indicate the 2kev flux density in quasars , it is a poor characterization of the shape of the true ionizing sed over @xmath1061000ev and we reiterate that the models shown in figure  [ fig : bb ] essentially represent the opposite extrema . here",
    "we close by merely pointing out that the apparent hard - spectrum nature of disk - dominated belrs and soft - spectrum nature of wind - dominated belrs suggests that these two extrema may have different soft x - ray excess properties and that the presence or lack of a soft x - ray excess might provide a way to reverse engineer the detailed shape of the ionizing sed ( which is important to radiation line driving ) .",
    "agn luminosities are often derived from observations in one , or at best a few , narrow bandpasses , whereas one wants the luminosity integrated over the full sed ( or perhaps just the accretion disk s contribution ; @xcite ) , i.e. , the bolometric luminosity .",
    "for example , the bolometric luminosity is the relevant quantity needed to estimate the accretion rate through @xmath107 .    considering our empirical seds and the range of @xmath6  values in our sample",
    ", we can see from figure  [ fig : sed ] that while the difference in seds may not appear to be very large , it is clearly _",
    "systematic_. if we assume the same bolometric correction for all quasars  regardless of their seds , then there will be a systematic error in @xmath108 as a function of their location in  eqw - blueshift parameter space .",
    "indeed , a change of 0.2 in @xmath6  corresponds to a 35% change in the integrated luminosity between 2500  and 2kev ( assuming that the sed is described only by @xmath6 ) .",
    "if there are additional features in the sed at far - uv wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or if the shape of the euv spectrum is more like the models in figure  [ fig : bb ] than our power - law fits , then that is an additional source of systematic error in the bolometric correction that arises through the adoption of a single mean sed ( or even one parameterized by the @xmath27@xmath6 relation ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the there is no single bolometric correction , but rather a roughly factor of four range around the mean value .",
    "while @xcite were unable to determine which classes of quasars should use lower / higher bolometric corrections , our work here would suggest that bolometric corrections may be systematically underestimated for large eqw - small blueshift quasars ( i.e. , those with disk - dominated belrs ) and systematically overestimated for small eqw - large blueshift quasars ( i.e , those with wind - dominated belrs ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to specifically parameterize the bolometric correction as a function of the indirectly measured ionizing flux in the euv ; however , we hope to pursue that in a future publication ( krawczyk et al .  2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "given the trends with uv luminosity in the eqw - blueshift parameter space , we might expect that more accurate bolometric corrections would result in a narrower distribution of @xmath108 .",
    "as @xmath108 is generally used to estimate the eddington ratio ( i.e. , mass weighted accretion rate ) , @xmath109 , those values may also have systematic errors .      given our findings on the systematic changes in sed over  eqw - blueshift parameter space , we consider the issue of nomenclature for these differences .",
    "in @xcite we referred to the rq quasars with small blueshifts and large eqws as `` rl - like '' because rl quasars are predominantly found in that part of  parameter space . based on our results above ,",
    "we suggest a simpler , yet more descriptive nomenclature .",
    "as rq quasars in the rl part of parameter space have harder ( more ionizing ) spectra , such objects could be broadly categorized as hard - spectrum quasars ( hsqs ) . the high - blueshift , low - eqw quasars on the other hand have softer ( less ionizing ) spectra and",

    "it is less clear what is happening in the low - eqw , low - blueshift quasars ( occupying the other part of the `` population a '' parameter space ) .",

    "chandra _ and/or",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations are needed to better understand the differences between sources with weak  that is systemic and weak  that is highly blueshifted .",
    "if the winds in high - blueshift , low - eqw quasars ( i.e. , ssqs ) are predominantly radiatively driven , their soft - spectrum nature can not be generally due to absorption along our line of sight , despite the fact that these objects appear to be the parent sample of balqsos .",
    "that is because the sed needs to be _ intrinsically _ soft in order to drive a strong radiation pressure driven wind .",
    "( mhd driving could also be at work , and may be a source of scatter in our diagrams . )",

    ", we showed that the extrema of large ( small )  eqw and small ( large )  blueshift can be attributed to different components of the belr : a disk and a wind , respectively . here , we consider the uv through x - ray properties of radio - quiet quasars in the  eqw - blueshift parameter space and argue that these extrema are likely due to a hard ionizing spectrum in the `` disk''-dominated systems and a soft ionizing spectrum in the `` wind''-dominated systems ( figures  [ fig : aox ] , [ fig : daox ] , and [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "indeed these extrema could instead be considered as hard - spectrum quasars ( hsq ) and soft - spectrum ( ssq ) quasars .",

    "the  emission line may further allow a quantification the differences in the `` unseen '' part of the ionizing sed ( e.g. , an excess in the helium continuum above the nominal assumed from @xmath6 ) and may help identify which objects are likely to show a soft x - ray excess feature .",

    "<S> in the restframe ultra - violet ( uv ) , two of the parameters that best characterize the range of emission - line properties in quasar broad emission - line regions are the equivalent width and the blueshift of the  @xmath01549 line relative to the quasar rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the connection between these emission - line properties and the uv through x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for radio - quiet ( rq ) quasars . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of a heterogeneous compilation of 406 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( at @xmath1 ) and palomar - green survey ( at @xmath2 ) that have well - measured  emission - line and x - ray properties ( including 164 objects with measured @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that rq quasars with both strong  emission and small  blueshifts can be classified as `` hard - spectrum '' sources that are ( relatively ) strong in the x - ray as compared to the uv . on the other hand , rq quasars with both weak  emission and large  blueshifts are instead `` soft - spectrum '' sources that are ( relatively ) weak in the x - ray as compared to the uv . </S>",
    "<S> this work helps to further bridge optical / soft x - ray `` eigenvector 1 '' relationships to the uv and hard x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> based on these findings , we argue that future work should consider systematic errors in bolometric corrections ( and thus accretion rates ) that are derived from a single mean sed . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the  emission line may allow for sed - dependent corrections to these quantities . </S>"
