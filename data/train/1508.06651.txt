    "work relations are remarkable identities associated with the behaviour of systems undergoing nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes .",
    "as the name suggests , they refer to the performance of mechanical work on a system brought about by a protocol of change in external force fields while the system exchanges heat with a coarsely specified environment .",
    "the key point is that they hold when the thermomechanical processing of a system takes place at an arbitrary rate , and not just in the quasistatic limit associated with equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "they are therefore statements about real nonequilibrium dissipative behaviour and have attracted attention since they provide a perspective on the nature of entropy production @xcite .",
    "the identification of principles underlying the transfer of energy in the form of heat and work motivated the initial development of thermodynamics in the 19th century , but the construction of a framework to justify such principles from a microscopic perspective is still ongoing .",
    "work relations , and the underlying fluctuation relations or theorems , rely on rather few assumptions about the dynamics of system components and have proved to be extremely valuable in this regard .",
    "one of the first results in this category was developed by bochkov and kuzovlev @xcite to describe the statistics of nonconservative work performed on a system in an isothermal heat bath .",
    "the evans - searles fluctuation theorem @xcite provided insight into the behaviour of deterministic complex systems driven by external mechanical and thermal interactions . a wider appreciation of fluctuation theorems , and of the significant development that was then underway in nonequilibrium statistical physics , followed from the derivation of the jarzynski equality @xcite , an elegant work relation that can be established from a number of perspectives .",
    "further interest in the field was generated by the crooks relation @xcite , a connection between the statistics of work performed in two isothermal processes that are driven in a mutually time - inverted fashion .",
    "both relations require the system to start out in thermal equilibrium . experimental relevance of these results has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we wish to explore work relations that hold for a system exposed to an environment with a temperature gradient .",
    "the control , characterisation and exploitation of nonisothermal conditions at the nanoscale has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic concepts such as system temperature can remain valid at these scales @xcite , though it is clear that temporal and spatial fluctuations will be important , aspects that can be accommodated through using stochastic thermodynamics as a theoretical description @xcite .",
    "the basis of this approach is a framework of stochastic system dynamics in which the concept of a temperature gradient enters through a specification of the statistical properties of the environmental noise .",
    "we have in mind applications to experimental systems such as tweezers @xcite and nanomechanical devices @xcite that can be used to manipulate small objects such as colloidal particles .",
    "there are challenges in establishing and controlling a temperature profile at sub - micron spatial scales , but progress has been made in this direction @xcite .",
    "models of heat transport can be used to describe the elevation of local temperature brought about by laser absorption in a liquid medium @xcite and by joule heating in conducting nanostructures @xcite , and it seems that a range of thermal profiles can be established using suitable arrangements of heat sources and sinks , together with choice of media @xcite .",
    "in such a nonisothermal environment , a system can not achieve thermal equilibrium , and our aim is to understand how the jarzynski and crooks results need to be adapted .",
    "work relations have been considered for other systems that are prevented from reaching thermal equilibrium , such as glasses @xcite .",
    "if the dynamics prevent or delay evolution towards the true equilibrium , a free energy of the final state might emerge as a valid concept , and so too might work relations .",
    "we focus our attention on the specific case of a harmonically bound particle in a quadratically varying thermal profile .",
    "we employ overdamped stochastic dynamics to model the behaviour of such a particle showing that is governed by tsallis rather than boltzmann statistics in the stationary state @xcite .",
    "we find that by using a suitable notation , the two work relations can be written in a very intuitive form for certain classes of protocols .",
    "a similar generalisation of the work relations to tsallis statistics was proposed by ponmurugan @xcite in the context of a basis in tsallis entropy .",
    "in contrast , our results emerge from a more standard thermodynamic framework where gibbs - shannon entropy represents the uncertainty of the state of a stochastic system . we review the nonisothermal stochastic dynamics of systems in section [ sec : dynamical - framework ] , describe the tsallis oscillator in section [ sec : tsallis - oscillator ] and then present analogues of the jarzynski and crooks results in sections [ sec : jarzynski - equality - for ] and [ sec : crooks - relation - for ] .",
    "we consider whether existing experimental techniques could be used to establish nonisothermal conditions to a degree that suits our purpose in section [ sec : practical - considerations ] before giving our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "dynamical approaches that do not introduce noise are available @xcite , but a stochastic framework @xcite has a number of intuitive and mathematical advantages @xcite .",
    "we consider a system that is weakly coupled to a complex environment where the uncertainty in the interactions that take place between them as time passes is represented by a stochastic force in the system dynamics .",
    "we focus attention on a particle that moves in one spatial dimension under the influence of a confining potential , a dissipative force proportional to the particle velocity and a stochastic force with a strength related to the local temperature of the environment but lacking autocorrelation .",
    "the dynamics in the overdamped limit are specified by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the particle position , @xmath3 is its mass , @xmath4 is the potential , @xmath5 is the friction coefficient , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the temperature of the environment .",
    "the noise @xmath8 has statistical properties @xmath9 and @xmath10 where the brackets denote an average over realisations .",
    "equivalently , we can express the dynamics using the following it@xmath11-rules stochastic differential equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an increment in a wiener process with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the work performed on the system as it follows a trajectory ( denoted @xmath17 ) in an interval @xmath18 is @xmath19=\\int_{0}^{\\tau}\\frac{\\partial\\phi(x(t),t))}{\\partial t}dt=\\int_{0}^{\\tau}\\dot{w}(x(t),t)dt,\\label{eq:102}\\ ] ] and for a constant environmental temperature @xmath20 it can readily be demonstrated @xcite that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the difference in helmholtz free energy , at temperature @xmath23 , brought about by a change in the potential from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",

    "the appropriate form of stochastic dynamics in these circumstances has recently received some attention @xcite , particularly with regard to thermodynamic differences arising from the neglect of housekeeping entropy production in an overdamped treatment @xcite .",
    "the key point we exploit is that with overdamped dynamics , the entropy production in the stationary nonisothermal state vanishes , such that it takes on something of the character of an equilibrium state , and this analogy allows us to construct an effective free energy change associated with a process and hence to derive work relations .",
    "the approach we take is to recast the dynamics of eq .",

    "we illustrate how eq . ( [ eq:112 ] ) can be interpreted for a model of 1-d particle motion in a harmonic confining potential and a temperature profile that varies quadratically with position measured from the centre of the potential .",
    "we consider @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter with the same dimensions as the spring constant @xmath53 .",

    "in contrast , an approximately quadratic temperature profile over a spatial scale of microns with a peak thermal gradient of about 10 k/@xmath169 m can be established by laser illumination of a patterned nanostructure immersed in a fluid medium @xcite .",
    "a particle can be confined within such a profile by thermophoresis ( thermal diffusion ) @xcite or potentially by optical methods as well .",
    "thermophoretic confinement provides much weaker trapping , with a spring constant of order @xmath118 pn / nm . the effect is equivalent to the presence of a potential given in dimensionless form by @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is an effective constant ambient temperature and @xmath172 is the soret coefficient that compares the strength of thermal diffusion , in response to a temperature gradient , with that of ordinary diffusion down a density gradient . for a quadratic temperature profile",
    "the confinement is harmonic with an effective spring constant @xmath173 and strongly nonisothermal conditions will therefore be established if @xmath174 .",

    "there remains the challenge of ensuring that such a trap is strong enough to retain a particle for a long enough time to perform measurements , and compromises will need to be made between the desired temperature profile and such requirements .",
    "nevertheless , it seems possible that with further technological development the conditions of interest might be attainable .",
    "work relations exist for systems that are maintained away from thermal equilibrium by constraints , and a number of such cases have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the situation we have explored here is of interest since the system in question , when described using overdamped dynamics , is governed by tsallis statistics in its stationary state .",
    "such statistical properties have been noted in a variety of physical systems @xcite , and contrast with the more usual gaussian statistics of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the analogues of the jarzynski equality and crooks relation for such a system , constructed for certain processes , take a particularly transparent form when we make use of the @xmath0-exponential functions associated with tsallis statistics .",
    "stochastic entropy production can provide the conceptual underpinning of work relations in nonisothermal as well as isothermal conditions , employing the usual gibbs - shannon form rather than the tsallis entropy .",
    "we believe that experimental verification of these identities might be possible in small systems where the appropriate nonisothermal environment can be established and controlled .",
