    "instantons  @xcite are well known to represent tunnelling transitions in non - abelian gauge theories between degenerate vacua of different topology .",
    "these transitions induce processes which are _ forbidden _ in perturbation theory , but have to exist in general  @xcite due to adler - bell - jackiw anomalies .",
    "an experimental discovery of such a novel , non - perturbative manifestation of non - abelian gauge theories would clearly be of basic significance .",
    "searches for instanton - induced processes received new impulses during recent years : first of all , it was shown  @xcite that the natural exponential suppression of these tunnelling rates , @xmath0 , may be overcome at _",
    "high energies_. furthermore , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera now offers a unique window  @xcite to experimentally detect processes induced by _ qcd - instantons_. here , a theoretical estimate of the corresponding production rates appears feasible as well  @xcite , since a well defined instanton contribution in the regime of small qcd - gauge coupling may be isolated on account of the photon virtuality @xmath1 .    in this brief status report",
    "we concentrate on a first , preliminary estimate of the rate for instanton - induced events  @xcite and some characteristics of the instanton - induced final state along with new search strategies  @xcite .",
    "these new results are based on our instanton monte - carlo generator  @xcite ( qcdins  1.3 ) .",
    "the instanton ( @xmath2 ) contribution to the nucleon structure functions is described in terms of the standard convolution of parton - structure functions , e.g. @xmath3 , with corresponding parton densities .",
    "the @xmath2-contribution to the ( dominating ) gluon - structure function @xmath3 arises from the @xmath4 matrix element as displayed in fig .",
    "the apparent structure of an @xmath2-subprocess , denoted by  @xmath2 \" in fig .  [ f1 ] , is due to the fact that the virtual photon only couples to instantons via it s quark content .",
    "we find  @xcite , that the @xmath2-contribution to the gluon - structure functions may be expressed in terms of the @xmath2-subprocess total cross section , @xmath5 , @xmath6 the integrations in eq .",
    "[ convolution ] extend over the bjorken variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , referring to the @xmath2-subprocess .",
    "a standard evaluation  @xcite leads to the following result  @xcite , @xmath9\\   .",
    "\\label{sigma}\\ ] ] the running scale @xmath10 in @xmath11 , satisfying @xmath12 with @xmath13 , plays the rle of an effective renormalization scale .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence resides in the functions @xmath15 and the so - called  holy - grail \" function @xmath16 , which are both known as low - energy expansions in @xmath17 within conventional @xmath2-perturbation theory .",
    "their form implies a rapid growth of @xmath5 for decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , in the phenomenologically most relevant region of small @xmath14 , the perturbative expressions are of little help and we have to ressort to some extrapolation .",
    "a distinguished possibility to go beyond instanton perturbation theory is the @xmath18-valley approximation  @xcite which we have adopted .",
    "it amounts to the identification of the holy - grail function with the known @xmath18-valley action .",
    "it appears reasonable to trust this method down to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , a value sometimes advocated @xcite as the lower bound for the holy - grail function .",
    "an important phenomenological / experimental task will be to make sure ( e.g. via kinematical cuts to the final state ) that @xmath14 does not become too small .",
    "note the following important feature of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath21 : the @xmath21 dependences from the high inverse power of @xmath11 and the exponential in eq .",
    "[ sigma ] compete to produce a strong peak far away from the ir region , e.g. @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 , which involves the integral over @xmath24 ( c.f . eq .",
    "[ convolution ] ) , is dominated by this peak and hence @xmath25 independent ( scaling ) in the bjorken limit .",
    "the predicted approach to this scaling limit resembles a  fractional twist \" term , where the twist is sliding with @xmath26 : the scaling violations vanish faster for increasing @xmath26 .      in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ( left ) we present the resulting @xmath2-induced total cross section for hera for two values ( 0.2,0.3 ) of the lower @xmath14 cut ( c.f . discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sigqg ] ) , as a function of the minimal bjorken @xmath26 , @xmath27 , considered .",
    "it is surprisingly large .",
    "so far , only the ( dominating ) gluon contribution has been taken into account .",
    "the inherent uncertainties associated with the renormalization / factorization scale dependences may be considerable and are presently being investigated . therefore , fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is still to be considered preliminary .",
    "the typical event ( fig .  [ f2 ] ( right ) ) from our monte - carlo generator  @xcite qcdins  1.3 based on herwig  5.8 , illustrates most of the important features characteristic for the underlying instanton mechanism : a current - quark jet along with a densely populated hadronic  band \" of width @xmath28 in the @xmath29-plane  @xcite .",
    "the band reflects the isotropy in the @xmath2-rest system .",
    "the total @xmath30 gev is large as well as the multiplicity , @xmath31 .",
    "finally , there is a characteristic flavor flow : all ( light ) flavors are democratically represented  @xcite in the final state .",
    "therefore , strongly enhanced rates of @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s ( from strange and charm decays ) represent crucial signatures for @xmath2-induced events .",
    "let us finally mention some recent attempts  @xcite to improve the sensitivity to @xmath2-induced events by adding in characteristic information on the _ event shapes_. the first step consists in boosting to the @xmath34-proton c.m . system and looking for events with high @xmath35 ( c.f .",
    "[ f3 ] ( left ) ) .",
    "we note that in this system 1 and 2 jet ( hard ) perturbative qcd processes deposit their energy predominantly in a _ plane _ passing through the @xmath34-proton direction .",
    "in contrast , the energies from @xmath2-induced events are always distributed much more _ spherically _ ( isotropy in the @xmath2-rest system ! ) .",
    "therefore , one may substantially reduce the normal dis background by looking at @xmath36 i.e. by minimizing @xmath37 by choice of @xmath38 , normal to the @xmath34-proton direction . for standard boson - gluon fusion 2 jet events ,",
    "@xmath37 is given by the jet widths .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath2-induced events @xmath39 is large .",
    "the quantitative results from the monte - carlo simulation , subject to additional cuts in @xmath40 which are to minimize higher - order perturbative qcd effects , are displayed in fig .",
