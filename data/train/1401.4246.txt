    "the highest frequency mode iii is ascribed to the cr - se vibration , however , modes ii and i originate from combined vibrations of cr - se and zn - se . for mode ii , the ratio of contribution from cr - se and zn - se is 78 : 18 , while for mode i the ratio of cr - se to zn - se is 21 : 73.@xcite cr - se bond relates to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin super - exchange interaction and zn - se links to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) super - exchanges.@xcite as a result , fm cr - x - cr bonds dominate modes ii and iii while afm linkages cr - x - a - x - cr determine mainly the eigenfrequency of mode i.@xcite the deviation of mode ii below 100 k due to spin - phonon coupling indicates that fm fluctuations involve already at this temperature .",

    "[ esr](a ) , with decreasing temperature from 300 k to 100 k , @xmath31 shows a constant value while @xmath30 decreases almost linearly . upon further cooling",
    ", @xmath31 drops drastically and accordingly @xmath30 broadens greatly , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the g factor is 1.996 , in agreement well with the previous works.@xcite the linear decrease of @xmath30 with temperature can be attributed to a single - phonon spin - lattice relaxation mechanism.@xcite both the constant g - factor and linear behavior of @xmath30 evidence a well - defined paramagnetic ( pm ) state at least above 100 k. note that @xmath31 starts to decrease and @xmath30 broadens at 100 k. meanwhile , an fm - related positive shift for mode ii is observed in the ir modes in fig .",
    "[ ftirf ] .",
    "these can thereby be correlated to the onset of fm fluctuations and spin - phonon coupling . as we know , @xmath31 is a sum of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the equivalent internal and the external actural fields , respectively . for the case",
    "@xmath32 @xmath34 0 , the internal field may shift the resonance line to lower field ; on the contrary , the resonance signal would appear at higher field with negative internal magnetic field .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath31 below 100 k indicates an increasing of @xmath32 , which may be caused by the interaction between the localized magnetic moments and the demagnetization effect.@xcite therefore , the enhancement of @xmath32 and onset of fm fluctuations reveal gradually growing fm clusters , forming an fm - cluster and pm mixed state from 100 k to @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of fm clusters is also supported by the following nte analysis . below @xmath2",
    ", the signal disappears due to the afm ordering transition .    as is discussed above",
    ", the system keeps a pure pm state at least above 100 k , so the inverse susceptibility should be described by the pm curie - weiss law down to this temperature .",
    "however , it departs from the linear behavior at a temperature as high as about 180 k , see fig .",
    "[ mt](b ) . recalling the fitting process in fig .",
    "[ mt](b ) , we have assumed a constant curie - weiss temperature @xmath35 , i.e. , a constant magnetic exchange interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of ir modes below 100 k implies a competition of fm and afm superexchange interactions .",
    "in addition , the nearest neighbor fm cr - se - cr and other neighbor afm cr - se - zn - se - cr superexchange interactions depend strongly on the lattice constant.@xcite it means that the total @xmath3 may change since @xmath10 decreases dramatically upon cooling [ fig .",
    "[ xrd](a ) ] .",
    "accordingly , the traditional curie - weiss behavior should be modified within the present case to bridge the gap mentioned above . in specific , one should take a variable @xmath36 ( or @xmath3 ) as a function of @xmath4 or @xmath10 into account .    in afm spinel oxides , the curie - weiss temperature changes exponentially with the lattice parameter.@xcite naturally , an empirical description of @xmath37 = @xmath38 is postulated .",
    "the fitting of the inverse susceptibility above 100 k using the modified curie - weiss behavior @xmath39 is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ tcw](a ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath40 = 226 and @xmath41 = 45 .",
    "furthermore , a remarkable deviation below 100 k in blue short dashed line indicates the appearance of the effective internal field originating from fm clusters .",
    "next , based on the obtained @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath37 is extrapolated to low temperatures as exhibited in fig .",
    "[ tcw](b ) .",
    "it shows a derivation at about 180 k from the nearly constant value . with further lowering temperature ,",
    "it decreases faster and faster and below @xmath4 @xmath42 45 k , @xmath37 even becomes negative .",
    "these features may interpret qualitatively the fact that zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 is dominated by ferromagnetic exchange interaction but orders antiferromagnetically at low temperatures .",
    "since the exchange integral and the curie - weiss temperature are linked by @xmath43 [ @xmath44 , we will use @xmath45 [ @xmath46 instead in the following discussion .",
    "taking a temperature or lattice constant @xmath10 dependent curie - weiss temperature into account .",
    "the short dashed blue line is an extension of the fitting to low temperatures .",
    "( b ) @xmath47 vs @xmath4 and the red dashed line indicates @xmath47 = 0 at 45 k. ]    given that @xmath3 is changeable , magnetic exchange and lattice elastic energies can link effectively with each other via magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "the free energy @xmath48 in a magnetoelastic system is expressed as    @xmath49    where n the number of the ion sites , @xmath50 the averaged vibrational angular frequency and @xmath51 the averaged strain relative to the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "the first term is exchange energy ( @xmath52 ) as a function of @xmath3 , the second is lattice elastic energy ( @xmath53 ) related mainly to the lattice parameter @xmath10 ( or equivalent @xmath4 ) and the last is the entropy . from the above equation we know that if the system stays at an ideal pm state , then @xmath52 = 0 .",
    "so @xmath52 and @xmath53 will show no coupling , as is observed from the ir spectra above 100 k.    when the system stays at an fm state with a changeable @xmath3 , there may exist a competition between @xmath52 and @xmath53 since the former is negative while the latter always positive .",
    "indeed , it has been concluded above that @xmath3 decreases exponentially [ fig .",
    "[ tcw](a ) ] and some fm clusters forms gradually below 100 k. therefore , the concomitant decrease of @xmath3 and @xmath10 causes an increasing @xmath52 but decreasing @xmath53 in the fm clusters . at some critical point",
    ", a totally compensation between them may present . if @xmath10 further decreases as cooling",
    ", the variation of @xmath52 would gradually exceed that of @xmath53 in magnitude .",
    "especially when @xmath3 drops sharply with respect to @xmath10 , say here at @xmath13 , a tiny decrement of @xmath10 will give rise to a dramatic increment of @xmath52 whereas @xmath53 keeps nearly constant .",
    "the state in a system subjected to stimuli , such as cooling , always tends to develop towards one that can lower @xmath48 . in this sense",
    "it is favorable to lowering @xmath48 by expanding the lattice parameter @xmath10 to increase @xmath3 ( @xmath54 ) and thereby to decrease @xmath52 due to its negative value , at the same time at a cost of few increases of @xmath53 in magnitude .",
    "this means that a negative thermal expansion of the lattice originating from the fm clusters with a exponentially changeable @xmath3 is expected .",
    "it is worthy of noting that when applying a magnetic field to the system in the nte temperature region , nte in magnitude enhances.@xcite this is because the size or population of the fm clusters increases when applying a magnetic field .    on the contrary ,",
    "when an afm ordering appears , @xmath3 becomes negative and the condition to stimulate nte is not met any more .",
    "normal thermal expansion upon cooling results in a simultaneous decreasing of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which is consistent to lowering @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , a normal expansion feature is observed below @xmath2.@xcite it should be noted that the existence of nte @xcite evidences in turn that @xmath3 is changeable .",
    "if @xmath3 keeps constant in a fm cluster , @xmath52 will be almost constant and a normal thermal expansion of the lattice alone can give rise to a decrease of @xmath53 and of @xmath48 sufficiently .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the origin of nte in strongly bond frustrated zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 . by fitting the inverse susceptibility above 100 k , an exponentially variable exchange @xmath3 is deduced .",
    "the exchange and lattice elastic energy can effectively couple with each other via magnetoelastic on basis of this changeable @xmath3 .",
    "nte is qualitatively interpreted as a competition between the two kinds of energy ."
