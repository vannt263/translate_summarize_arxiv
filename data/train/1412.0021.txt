    "<S> we consider two dimensional systems in which edge states coexist with a gapless bulk . </S>",
    "<S> such systems may be constructed , for example , by coupling a gapped two dimensional state of matter that carries edge states to a gapless two dimensional system in which the spectrum is composed of a number of dirac cones . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the absence of disorder the edge states could be protected even when the two systems are coupled , due to momentum and energy conservation . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish between weak and strong edge states by the level of their mixing with the bulk . in the presence of disorder </S>",
    "<S> , the edge states may be stabilized when the bulk is localized or destabilized when the bulk is metallic . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the conditions under which these two cases occur . finally , we propose a concrete physical realization for one of our models on the basis of bilayer hg(cd)te quantum wells .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction  _ the classification and realization of topological states of matter are among the main themes in modern condensed matter physics @xcite . of particular interest are topological insulators and topological superconductors , which have drawn a great deal of attention over the past few years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of these states is gapped , but the edge is commonly gapless . </S>",
    "<S> the gapless edge modes are protected from back - scattering and localization either by chirality or by symmetry .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present several examples of two dimensional models that simultaneously host one - dimensional gapless modes on the edge and are gapless in the two - dimensional bulk . in the absence of disorder </S>",
    "<S> , these models all share similar spectral and transport characteristics , showing distinct bulk and edge contributions that do not mix . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the effect of disorder unravels the difference between these models . in some of the models disorder stabilizes the edge modes and decouples them from the bulk , while in others it completely mixes the two . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the different nature of the different models is unraveled when we introduce weak perturbations that open energy gaps in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we provide concrete hamiltonians for the different models based on coupling a gapless phase to a topological phase , for example in a bilayer system , and analyze the spectral and transport properties of these models . beyond that , we present a concrete physical realization based on a bilayer hg(cd)te quantum well . note that the systems we consider share the lack of bulk energy gaps with weyl semi - metals , but are distinguished from the latter by being two dimensional and by having no topological protection to the gapless nature of the bulk .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge properties in gapped topological states of matter can be studied through the local density of states ( ldos ) . at energies smaller than the bulk energy gap , the ldos is non - zero at the edge , and decreases exponentially as a function of the distance from the edge . due to the absence of a bulk gap , </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for the systems we consider , and we therefore have to employ different methods for studying the edge . for the clean case , we study a cylindrical geometry , in which the lattice momentum parallel to the edge , @xmath0 , commutes with the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we find two types of edge states , which we call strong and weak . </S>",
    "<S> strong edge states carry a momentum @xmath0 and an energy @xmath1 for which there are no bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , their wave functions are exponentially localized near the edge with the localization length being inversely proportional to the bulk gap at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> weak edge states occur when for all values of @xmath0 and energies @xmath1 for which there are states at the edge , there are also states in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states then hybridize with the bulk states , and their wave functions are not exponentially localized . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the `` strength '' of the edge mode depends on the orientation of the edge . </S>",
    "<S> for the models we consider , there are only a few orientations in which the edges are weak .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge states are also reflected in transport . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish between edge versus bulk transport by studying transport in devices of two terminals with both periodic and hard wall boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this method is useful also in the presence of disorder , where states are not characterized by momentum . </S>",
    "<S> generally , in gapped phases with non - trivial topological index , edge state transport is robust as long as the relevant energy scales for transport are smaller than the bulk gap . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for the systems we consider , the bulk gap vanishes , and yet the edge state transport may still be robust . in particular , we find that disorder may even stabilize the edge state transport .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of disorder on the systems we consider may be inferred from the effect of a translational invariant perturbation that opens a gap in the bulk spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> such a perturbation makes the system acquire a well - defined topological index . when the topological index is a chern number whose value does not depend on the perturbation that opens the gap , the gapless phase is a transition between two insulating phases with the same chern number . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the presence of disorder , the bulk states may become localized and the edge states stabilize . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the gapless phase separates two topologically distinct insulating phases the phase diagram in the space of disorder and gap - opening perturbation must contain a critical line , where the bulk states remain delocalized and the edge states disappear . away from the critical line , </S>",
    "<S> the system is a well - defined chern insulator . for cases where the topological index is not a chern number , the localization properties of the bulk and edge states depend on the symmetries of the specific model .    </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce four models that share the same behavior in the absence of disorder , namely a coexistence of edge states and gapless bulk , but strongly differ away from that point . </S>",
    "<S> the models we consider are based on a designed coupling between a gapped two - dimensional topological phase @xmath2 and a gapless two - dimensional phase @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example would be a bilayer system in which the two layers are described by the hamiltonians @xmath4 and are tunnel - coupled by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath6 here , the topological phase @xmath2 is an insulator or a superconductor with a non - trivial topological index . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we assume that the gap of @xmath2 is the largest energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath3 is gapless , for example , having a dirac spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath5 is chosen such that the full hamiltonian remains gapless . </S>",
    "<S> the different blocks should be combined such that the full hamiltonian is irreducible , and hence it belongs to a symmetry class according to ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the symmetry class of the full hamiltonian is the minimal symmetry of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , although , by fine tuning parameters , the resulting hamiltonian may accidentally obey additional symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> in the first three models @xmath2 describes a quantum hall state with a non - zero chern number , while @xmath3 describes three gapless phases that follow three different symmetries . as a consequence of the different symmetries , the effect of disorder on the three systems is markedly different . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth model belongs to a different topological class , but has the advantage of being experimentally accessible in a bilayer hg(cd)te quantum well .    </S>",
    "<S> _ [ qah_4dcmodel]model i  a gapped chern insulator coupled to a two - dimensional dirac metal_. for the topological part , @xmath2 , we take the qi - wu - zhang hamiltonian @xcite of the quantum anomalous hall effect , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy and the @xmath9 s are the pauli matrices in spin space . here and in the following , we set the lattice constant to @xmath10 , as well as @xmath11 , expressing all other hamiltonian parameters relative to these scales </S>",
    "<S> . the model belongs to symmetry class a and has a non - zero chern number for @xmath12 . for the gapless part </S>",
    "<S> , we use @xmath13 which contains four dirac cones in its spectrum , at @xmath14 and @xmath15 . notice that this model obeys effective time - reversal , particle - hole and chiral symmetries which all three square to unity : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it belongs to class bdi , which is topologically trivial in two spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we take @xmath19 for the coupling hamiltonian . in fact , for any @xmath5 with a zero determinant , the full hamiltonian remains gapless . </S>",
    "<S> solving for its spectrum in a cylindrical geometry , we find weak edges when the boundary is along the @xmath20 direction or spans an angle of @xmath21 with the @xmath22 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the strong edge states appear for all other boundary orientations .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the system with open boundary conditions in the @xmath20 direction is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the blue points denote bulk states while the red / green points denote right / left propagating edge states , whose wave functions decay exponentially into the bulk ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : openyx]b ) . the zero modes in the bulk </S>",
    "<S> coexist with well localized chiral edge states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spectrum and typical edge states of a system with open boundary conditions in the @xmath22 direction are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : openyx]c , d. here , the red points denote edge states that hybridize with the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> we find numerically that the local density of states near the edge is larger than in the bulk ( not shown ) , but the latter does not decay to zero at large distances from the edge .    adding a mass term @xmath23 to @xmath3 opens a bulk gap . </S>",
    "<S> this term breaks both the @xmath24 and @xmath25 symmetries of @xmath3 , but leaves @xmath26 intact . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the gapped version of @xmath3 belongs to class ai , which is also topologically trivial in two spatial dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full hamiltonian , for @xmath27 , is then a class a chern insulator with a non - zero chern number that is independent of the sign of @xmath28 , so it belongs to the first class of models mentioned in the introduction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the system has to have chiral gapless edge states as well as a gapped bulk , independent of the orientation of the edge . </S>",
    "<S> the weak edge states must therefore be stabilized by the appearance of a small mass term . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the same holds for disorder  the full hamiltonian belongs to class a , in which the bulk states become localized . due to the non - zero chern number , the edge states can not disappear , and must therefore be stabilized by disorder .    to confirm this expectation , </S>",
    "<S> we numerically analyze two - terminal transport in the system . </S>",
    "<S> all transport simulations are performed using the kwant code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we discretize the hamiltonian on a square lattice of @xmath29 sites , and attach ideal leads in the @xmath22-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to compute the scattering matrix @xmath30 which we use to determine the conductance @xmath31 , @xmath32 , in the low bias voltage , low temperature limit . in the @xmath20-direction , </S>",
    "<S> we use either hard - wall boundary conditions ( hall bar geometry ) , or apply periodic boundary conditions to the states , @xmath33 , to access only the bulk contribution to transport ( corbino geometry ) . here and in all other models </S>",
    "<S> , disorder is introduced as a random variation of the fermi energy , drawn independently for each lattice site from the uniform distribution @xmath34 $ ] .    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 4dc_transport ] , when the disorder strength @xmath35 increases the bulk contribution goes to zero , while the edge contributions become quantized . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is obtained by performing transport simulations with periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a mass term ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase_diag_1a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the gapless point , @xmath36 , both the addition of a mass term or disorder drive the system into a chern insulating phase with @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ [ qheqhemodel]model ii  a gapped chern insulator coupled to a chern insulator at its critical point_. in this model , we keep @xmath2 as before , but replace @xmath3 by a hamiltonian of a quantum hall state at the transition between two chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is nothing but the hamiltonian appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aqh ] with @xmath38 and with @xmath39 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the gapped @xmath3 belongs to class a with either chern number zero or @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the full hamiltonian is a class a chern insulator with a chern number changing from @xmath41 to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to model i , here the edge states disappear as disorder is introduced , since the system enters a @xmath41 phase . </S>",

    "<S> now we choose an @xmath3 that does not get localized by weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that its coupling to the gapped chern insulator makes it amenable to localization . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath3 to be the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model for the quantum spin hall effect @xcite , @xmath42 with @xmath43 where the @xmath44 s act in the subspace of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbitals of the bhz model . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : openyx]a and [ fig : openyx]b , in the absence of disorder , bulk and edge modes coexist in the spectrum , as shown in appendix b. while @xmath48 is time - reversal symmetric , allowing for the existence of metallic phases in the presence of disorder , the coupled model belongs to class a , where weak disorder leads to localization . </S>",
    "<S> seemingly , the phase diagram in the space of @xmath47 and disorder strength @xmath35 , depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qah_bhz_pd ] , shows a metallic phase at finite disorder strength ( close to @xmath50 ) , reminiscent of that present in the bhz model . </S>",
    "<S> however , a conductance scaling analysis ( fig .  [ bhz_scaling_mid ] ) shows that it is only metallic in the decoupled case . </S>",
    "<S> when the coupling is turned on , the conductance decreases with system size , showing that the presence of the conducting region is caused by the finite - size of the system . in accordance with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase_diag_1a ] , as the disorder strength is increased , the bulk states localize leaving behind only the quantized conductance contribution of the edge states . </S>",
    "<S> this exemplifies the fact that both the topological and the localization properties depend on the symmetry class of the full hamiltonian . in the thermodynamic limit </S>",
