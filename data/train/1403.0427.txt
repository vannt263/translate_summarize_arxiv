    "explaining structure formation in the expanding universe is one of the major topics in cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "according to the current main - stream understanding , dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) are the dynamically dominating components of the universe @xcite .",
    "baryons contribute only a small fraction of less than 5% to the cosmic energy budget .",
    "the standard @xmath3cdm model does well in fitting most observational data but there is an ongoing interest in alternative models within and beyond general relativity . a class of alternative models within general relativity `` dynamizes '' the cosmological constant , resulting in so - called @xmath0cdm models .",
    "taking the cosmological principle for granted , cosmic structures represent inhomogeneities in the matter distribution on an otherwise spatially homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "dynamical de models , @xmath0cdm models are a subclass of them , have to deal with inhomogeneities of the de component in addition to the matter inhomogeneities to which they are coupled .",
    "this makes these models technically more complex than the standard model .",
    "ignoring perturbations of the de component altogether may lead to inconsistencies and unreliable conclusions concerning the interpretation of observational data @xcite .",
    "whether or not de perturbations are relevant has to be decided on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the directly observed inhomogeneities are of baryonic nature . from the outset it is not clear that the inhomogeneities in the baryonic matter coincide with the inhomogeneities of the dm distribution .",
    "in particular , if dm interacts nongravitationally with de , which happens in @xmath0cdm models , while baryonic matter is in geodesic motion , this issue has to be clarified . a reliable description of the observed matter distribution has to consider the perturbation dynamics of the baryon fraction even though the latter only marginally influences the homogeneous and isotropic cosmic background dynamics .",
    "then , in models with dynamical de , the perturbations of baryonic matter will necessarily be coupled to the inhomogeneities of both dm and de . in a general context",
    ", the importance of including the physics of the baryon component in the cosmic dynamics has been emphasized recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend a previously established decaying vacuum model @xcite by including a separately conserved baryon fluid with a four - velocity that differs from the four - velocity of the dm component .",
    "the basic ingredient of this model is a de component with an energy density proportional to the hubble rate .",
    "moreover , it is characterized by an equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath4 for vacuum .",
    "equivalently , the resulting dynamics can be understood as a scenario of dm particle production at a constant rate @xcite or as the dynamics of a non - adiabatic chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "de perturbations for this model are explicitly related to dm perturbations and their first derivative with respect to the scale factor in a scale - dependent way .",
    "it has been shown that on scales that are relevant for structure formation , de fluctuations are smaller than the dm fluctuations by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "our analysis will be performed within a gauge - invariant formalism in terms of variables adapted to comoving observers @xcite .",
    "we shall derive a set of two second - order equations that couple the total fractional energy - density perturbations of the cosmic medium to the difference between these total perturbations and the fractional baryonic perturbations .",
    "the perturbations of the baryon fluid are then found as a suitable linear combination .",
    "as far as the background dynamics is concerned , our updated tests against observations from snia , bao and the position of the first acoustic peak of the cmb spectrum confirm previous results @xcite . including the lss data",
    "improves the concordance of the model compared with the case without a separately conserved baryon component .",
    "the joint analysis allows us to predict the baryon abundance of the universe independently of the dm abundance .",
    "the corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) exhibits a pronounced peak at about 5% for this abundance .",
    "this is a new feature which entirely relies on a separate consideration of the baryon fluid .",

    "our key result is an expression for the fractional baryon energy - density perturbation for an observer comoving with the baryon fluid . using the lss data of the sdss dr7 project we obtained the pdf for the baryon abundance of the universe independently of the dm abundance .",
    "the best - fit value of this abundance is @xmath194 ( 2@xmath42 cl ) in remarkable agreement with the result from primordial nucleosnthesis . a combined analysis , including also data from snia , bao and cmb confirms this result .",
    "for the best - fit value of the dm abundance we found @xmath195 ( @xmath177 cl ) from the combined analysis ( lss+bao+snia(union2.1)+cmb ) and @xmath190 ( @xmath177 cl ) from the lss data alone .",
    "these values are higher than those for the standard model but smaller than the corresponding value for a @xmath0cdm model without a separately conserved baryon component .",
    "generally , the explicit inclusion of the baryon fluid improves the concordance between background and perturbation dynamics .",
    "our results indicate that the investigated @xmath0cdm cosmology , which does not have a @xmath3cdm limit , has a competitive background dynamics but as far as the baryon matter power spectrum is concerned , the @xmath3cdm model is clearly favored .",

    "<S> we consider the perturbation dynamics for the cosmic baryon fluid and determine the corresponding power spectrum for a @xmath0cdm model in which a cosmological term decays into dark matter linearly with the hubble rate . </S>",
    "<S> the model is tested by a joint analysis of data from supernovae of type ia ( snia ) ( constitution and union 2.1 ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , the position of the first peak of the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale - structure ( lss ) data ( sdss dr7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics is only marginally influenced by the baryons , there are modifications on the perturbative level if a separately conserved baryon fluid is included . </S>",
    "<S> considering the present baryon fraction as a free parameter , we reproduce the observed abundance of the order of @xmath1 independently of the dark - matter abundance which is of the order of @xmath2 for this model . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the concordance between background and perturbation dynamics is improved if baryons are explicitly taken into account . </S>"
