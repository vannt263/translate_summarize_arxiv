    "the renormalization consists of 1 ) the construction of the wannier orbitals for the target bands and the derivation of the tight - binding hamiltonian in the wannier basis followed by 2 ) the computation of the effective interaction for the target wannier orbitals screened by the eliminated bands .",
    "this partial screening is computed by following the standard constrained rpa method@xcite . after deriving the effective low - energy model , 3 ) it is solved by solvers such as the mult - variable variational monte carlo method  @xcite",
    "whose framework is outlined in s.3 .",
    "this hybrid method has been applied to various materials that exhibit strong electron - correlation effects including transition metal compounds and organic conductors ( for a review , see ref . ) . in the present case ,",

    "the validity of our effective model in 2d is confirmed by the fact that the magnetic ordered moment is consistent with the experimental values as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "our 2d low - energy model is written for ten - fold degenerate fe-3@xmath1 orbitals in a unit cell containing two fe atoms in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath76 on the @xmath9th maximally localized wannier orbital  @xcite at the @xmath10-th site .",

    "<S> the reason for the strong incoherence toward @xmath2 is that all the orbitals become nearly half filling at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong commensurability leads to a solid mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the large dome structure is a consequence of an overwhelming strong proximity of the @xmath2 ( half - filled ) mott insulator , which blankets the @xmath0 commensurability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , signatures of several first - order transitions seen in fig.[fig.1 ]  ( b ) in the filling control signal large charge fluctuations with tendency toward the phase separation and incoherence . </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect found in the doping dependence is the switching in the magnetic order ; the transition from the stripe to g - type orders at @xmath31 [ fig.1  ( b ) ] , which is explained by the geometrical frustration effects : the ratio of the diagonal next - nearest ( @xmath32 ) to the nearest - neighbor(@xmath16 ) transfers , i.e. , @xmath33 measures the frustration effect . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbitals have @xmath36 , while for @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals @xmath39  @xcite , where the orbitals are labeled in the representation of the folded brillouin zone  @xcite . around @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the frustrated @xmath35 is dominant because of the differentiated pinning to half filling , while near @xmath2 , all the orbitals are pinned to half filling and @xmath37 and @xmath38 become the more important players because of the larger effective interactions , which favors the g - type order . </S>",
    "<S> nearby g - type order is suggestive of proposed nodes in the pairing symmetry of heavily hole doped kfe@xmath5as@xmath5@xcite . in this connection , </S>",
    "<S> the double - stripe type order at @xmath40 experimentally observed for fete is also accounted for by the involvement of the less frustrated @xmath38 orbital .     </S>",

    "<S> fade out of sharp boundaries in @xmath30 , representing the fermi pockets , are seen especially for @xmath49 and @xmath35 together with @xmath38 , which signals strong renormalizations of quasiparticles with bad metallic behavior when @xmath23 decreases progressively to negative . , width=321 ]    to further understand the proximity effect of @xmath2 mott physics , we monitor the effects of coulomb ( @xmath15 ) and exchange ( @xmath50 ) interactions separately by the scaling parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig.3 ] reveals that @xmath15 and @xmath50 comparably contribute at @xmath0 in enhancing the ordered magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> the hund s rule coupling @xmath50 retains the metallic but af order even far away from half filling ( @xmath2 ) contrary to the quick collapse of the af order in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the present result conforms with a suggestion of an importance of @xmath50 away from half filling  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> figures [ fig.3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate that the @xmath35 orbital is under the strongest correlation effects indicated by the smallest double occupation [ panel  ( b ) ] and a remarkable pinning around half filling [ ( c ) ] even for relatively small @xmath21 , though the effective coulomb interaction on the @xmath35 is the smallest even at @xmath27  @xcite , i.e. , onsite intraorbital interaction for the @xmath35 orbital is 1.68 ev in comparison to 2.24 - 2.75 ev for other intraorbital values .  </S>",
    "<S> ( see table i in supplemental materials . ) </S>",
    "<S> this puzzle is solved by the largest bare density of states at the fermi level ( see fig.3 of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath21 increases around @xmath27 ( realistic for lafeaso ) , the @xmath38 orbital quickly follows up the @xmath35 , because the @xmath35 orbital has the largest hund s rule coupling @xmath50 with @xmath38 ( 0.43 ev in comparison to 0.23 ev with @xmath37 and 0.35 ev with @xmath49 ) . </S>",

    "<S> models for other families  @xcite.the strong crossover from low to high magnetic moments by changing from lafeaso , bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 through fete is accounted by this interplay of @xmath35 and @xmath38 orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> one might suspect that the disappearance of the magnetic order in hole doped ba@xmath64k@xmath65fe@xmath5as@xmath5 at @xmath66@xcite appears to contradict the present result . </S>",
    "<S> however , k doping does not work as a simple filling control but yields more complicated effects , because the fe square lattice shrinks upon the k doping . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneously enhances the bandwidth ( nearly 10% ) and works also as the bandwidth control driving into weak correlation regime . at @xmath67 and @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the @xmath2 mott insulator with a large mott gap ( @xmath68ev ) with a high ordered moment ( @xmath25 2.5@xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it implies a connection with a g - type af insulator in isostructural but @xmath2 compound lamnpo@xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary. _ we have shown that the underlying proximity effects of the @xmath70 mott insulator governs the electronic structures of iron - based superconductors , which are located around @xmath71 filling . when the mott proximity is weakened , strong orbital and spin fluctuations take place before the verge to weakly correlated metals . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the high-@xmath72 superconducting region around the @xmath0 filling . </S>",
    "<S> it shares a common character with the cuprates , while a new aspect here is an involvement of the orbital fluctuation and differentiation under the big umbrella of the @xmath2 mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath71 is commensurate filling , the dirac nodes in the band dispersions maintain the metal for unexpectedly wide region  @xcite , while the interactions develop the antiferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the af quantum critical points accompany the strong crossover of the orbital polarization as well and the superconducting mechanism has to be clarified under this circumstance . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to focus particularly on the role of the @xmath35 and @xmath38 orbitals as the leading players , in contrast to the @xmath34 orbitals in the nesting picture . in the present results , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 dominance washes away the subtlety of the nesting . </S>",
    "<S> experimental clarification of the large dome structure in the full bandwidth and filling controls in the range from @xmath2 to @xmath0 is highly desired to clarify the whole perspective of the electron correlation effect in the iron - based superconductors .    </S>",
