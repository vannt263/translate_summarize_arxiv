    "in this short communication we focus on the analysis of various random quantities related to the transient of a lvy - driven queue . throughout ,",
    "we denote the driving lvy process by @xmath2 , uniquely characterized through its lvy exponent @xmath3 as usual , the corresponding _ queueing process _ ( or : workload process ) @xmath4 is defined as the solution to the skorokhod problem ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is well known that @xmath11 converges to a stationary distribution as @xmath12 if and only if @xmath8 has a negative drift , that is , @xmath13 a.s .",
    "; _ we therefore assume that this condition is in place throughout this work_.",
    "if @xmath14 is well - defined , then this condition is equivalent to requiring that @xmath15 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is also a standard result that the stationary distribution of @xmath11 coincides with the distribution of @xmath16 , the _ overall supremum _ ; this is a property that is often attributed to reich ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 2.5 ) ) .",
    "importantly , in the sequel we systematically assume that @xmath7 _ has the stationary distribution _ ; as will become clear , this assumption plays a crucial role in the analysis . as mentioned above",
    ", the primary objective of this note is to study various transient metrics related to the process  @xmath11 .",
    "all our results are in terms of transforms of the quantities of interest , in addition transformed with respect to time . in this respect , it is recalled that taking transforms with respect to time essentially amounts to considering @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an exponential variable with rate @xmath19 ( i.e. , with mean @xmath20 ) , sampled independently of everything else .    this note is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we sketch preliminaries , related to splitting at extrema and the wiener - hopf factorization . in section 3",
    "we focus on the distribution of the minimum workload attained over an exponentially distributed amount of time .",
    "section 4 provides transforms of some other quantities of interest , distinguishing between two cases : ( i )  the ongoing busy period and ( ii )  the finished initial busy period , in which case the focus is on the so - called unused capacity . finally , section  5 focuses on the minimal workload in a queue conditioned to be positive .",
    "we conclude the paper by mentioning some challenging open problems .",
    "let us state some well - known facts about splitting and the wiener - hopf factorization , all of which can be found in e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "vi ) . consider the process @xmath21 on the interval @xmath22 $ ] and let @xmath23 : x_t\\wedge x_{t-}=\\underline x_{e_q}\\}\\ ] ] be the ( last ) time of the minimum .",
    "it is well known that the process @xmath21 _ splits at its minimum _ , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "this result can be stated in a simple form when considering the process @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "namely , the processes @xmath27\\}\\:\\text { and } \\:\\{x'_{t+\\underline g_{e_q}}-x'_{\\underline g_{e_q } } , t\\in[0,e_q-\\underline g_{e_q}]\\}\\ ] ] are independent ( note that @xmath28 and @xmath21 differ only if @xmath21 jumps up at @xmath29  this jump should be included in the right process , but not in the left ) .",
    "in particular , the above implies that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are independent .",
    "splitting in the queueing context used earlier ; see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "let us define the following two functions for @xmath32 with @xmath33 : @xmath34}(e^{-t}-e^{-{{\\alpha}}t-{{\\beta}}x})\\frac{1}{t}{{\\mathbb p}}(x_t\\in { \\mathrm d}x){\\mathrm d}t\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are the laplace exponents of the so - called ( strictly ) ascending and ( weakly ) descending bivariate ladder processes , respectively .",
    "in general these functions are defined up to a multiplicative constant ; the trivial scaling chosen in   implies that @xmath35 by virtue of the frullani integral identity .",
    "this particular scaling simplifies the calculations in the proofs , but it does not affect the results of the paper .",
    "the laplace exponents can then be used to express the so - called _ wiener - hopf factors _ : @xmath36 where @xmath37 : x_t\\vee x_{t-}=\\overline x_{e_q}\\}$ ] is the ( first ) time of the maximum .",
    "finally , for @xmath38 we have @xmath39 which according to   yields @xmath40    let us finally remark that one has to distinguish between first and last extrema only in the case when @xmath21 is a compound poisson process ; the same is true also for open and closed integration sets in  .",
    "in @xcite the distribution of the minimum workload during @xmath41 was characterized for the case the driving lvy process is spectrally one - sided ; it was assumed that the workload is in stationarity at time  0 . in this section , this result is extended to the spectrally two - sided case .",
    "several ramifications of this result are presented as well .    throughout",
    "we let @xmath42 be the running minimum of the workload , i.e. , @xmath42 is the minimum of @xmath43 over @xmath44 $ ] , and we assume that @xmath7 has the stationary workload distribution .      this subsection shows how to express the transform of @xmath42 in terms of the wiener - hopf factors . observe that @xmath45 which follows by considering the event @xmath46 and its complement separately . to this end , we first rewrite the definition of @xmath11 , as given in  , in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath42 : @xmath48 which is also easily seen from figure  [ fig : pics ] .",
    "this means that we in particular have @xmath49 where the two terms on the right are independent , because of   and splitting at the infimum , i.e.  @xmath31 and @xmath30 are independent , see section  [ sec : prelim ] . using   we thus obtain the identity @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath7 has the stationary workload distribution , so does @xmath52 as a consequence , @xmath53 has the distribution of @xmath54 , which yields the following result , see also  .    for any @xmath55 , @xmath56",
    "it is noted that equation ( [ eq : principal ] ) generalizes the findings of @xcite which just cover the spectrally one - sided cases ; it is readily verified that plugging in expressions for @xmath57 for the one - sided cases the formulas obtained are in accordance with those derived in @xcite .",
    "the transform of @xmath58 has a simple explicit form also in the case when @xmath7 is exponential ( with mean @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 and then   yields @xmath61 . throughout this work",
    "we assume that @xmath7 has the stationary distribution , but virtually all results carry over to the case of the exponential initial distribution .",
    "we conclude this section by deriving a related , elegant identity . to this end , we define by @xmath62 the time when the system becomes empty for the first time ; @xmath63 is also referred to as the _ residual busy period _ as seen from time 0 , and the equality follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "vi.4 ) . clearly , @xmath64 and as a consequence@xmath65 taking @xmath66 in  , and noting that @xmath67 which follows from  , we obtain @xmath68 showing that @xmath63 and @xmath69 , the ( first ) time of the overall maxima , have the same distribution ( which was concluded , using another line of argumentation , in @xcite as well ) .",
    "in this section we analyze a few more refined quantities that are related to the minimum workload . in this respect observe that @xmath70:q_t\\wedge q_{t-}=\\underline q_{e_q}\\right\\}\\ ] ] is also the ( last ) time of the minimal workload , see figure  [ fig : pics ] . in the sequel we find it convenient to distinguish between the following two cases : @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. , if the residual busy period is still going on at time @xmath18 , or not . in the second case",
    "we look at the first and the last times when the workload attains the value  0 , i.e.  the time @xmath63 when the first busy period finishes and the time @xmath29 when the last busy period starts .",
    ".5     0.5       note that combined with   provides us with the equality @xmath73 describing the distribution of @xmath58 on the event @xmath74 the following result gives a simple expression of the joint transform of various quantities related to the minimal workload in an ongoing busy period .    for any @xmath75 , @xmath76    by appealing to the usual splitting argument",
    ", we can write @xmath77 see   and  .",
    "now realize that @xmath78 for any borel function @xmath79 .",
    "it therefore immediately follows that @xmath80 replacing consistently @xmath81 by @xmath19 , and @xmath82 by @xmath83 , we thus obtain @xmath84 finally , again relying on the splitting argument , we arrive at @xmath85 see  , completing the proof .      in the case",
    "@xmath72 we define two random quantities : @xmath86 see figure  [ fig : pics](b ) .",
    "the first can be interpreted as the _ unused capacity _ , and the second as the sudden unused capacity at the end of the initial busy period .",
    "the latter quantity may be of limited interest , but it can be included in the joint transform without any additional work .",
    "first we start with a basic result complementing  .",
    "[ prop : u ] for any @xmath55 , @xmath87    first we compute for @xmath88 @xmath89 see  , and  . using   this can be rewritten as @xmath90 finally , using   we can express @xmath91 . plugging this in yields that the expression in the previous display equals @xmath92 which easily reduces to the expression in the statement .",
    "finally , analytic continuation shows that it is true for all @xmath93 with @xmath94 .    for any @xmath95 , @xmath96    by splitting we have @xmath97 see also   and proposition  [ prop : u ] .",
    "moreover , using we write @xmath98 as before , changing parameters leads to @xmath99 next , we apply the strong markov property at the time  @xmath63 to obtain the identity @xmath100 which leads to @xmath101 using   and  .",
    "finally , we write using the strong markov property at @xmath63 and splitting at @xmath29 @xmath102 which in view of   completes the proof .",
    "in this section we focus on the law of @xmath58 conditional on the queue not having idled between @xmath0 and @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath71 , and provide an alternative representation of this law in the limiting case when @xmath103 .",
    "we also comment on the relation of this limit law to lvy processes conditioned to stay positive .",
    "it follows directly from   and   that @xmath104 note , however , that the corresponding conditional law does not have a direct link ( via laplace transform ) to its transient counterpart , i.e.  when @xmath18 is replaced by  @xmath105 .    in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath106 ( and so also @xmath107 for @xmath51 ) , where the derivative of @xmath108 is taken with respect to  @xmath19 .",
    "according to   this requirement is equivalent to @xmath109 ; see proposition  [ prop : onesided ] for an example when this assumption does not hold .",
    "now it follows from   that @xmath110 along the same lines , one can establish the generalization @xmath111    it must be noted that the limit law of @xmath112 as @xmath103 does not coincide with the so - called quasi - stationary distribution of the minimal workload , i.e.  with that of @xmath113 as @xmath114 , even though @xmath115 a.s . as @xmath103 .",
    "roughly speaking , conditioning on @xmath116 does not only force @xmath63 to be large , but also makes @xmath18 to appear smaller . in this respect",
    "it may be helpful to mention that @xmath117 i.e.  the limit law of @xmath118 is a proper distribution , the residual life distribution associated to  @xmath63 . for related results on the quasi - stationary behaviour of reflected one - sided lvy processes we refer to e.g.  @xcite .",
    "[ rem : levy_conditioned ] importantly , one way to construct a lvy process started in @xmath119 and conditioned to stay positive ( in the usual sense ) is to condition on @xmath116 and then let @xmath103 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop .  1 ) .",
    "the distribution of the infimum of this process is characterized in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  1 ) .",
    "note , however , that the limit distribution of @xmath112 can not be obtained from this result by integrating with respect to @xmath120 .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath121 because the event upon which we condition depends on @xmath7 .",
    "this result has a simple intuitive explanation .",
    "firstly , on the left hand side we have the limit of @xmath125 .",
    "secondly , it holds that @xmath126 , where the two terms on the right are independent and the distribution of the first converges to that of @xmath7 as @xmath103 .",
    "[ prop : onesided ] assume that @xmath21 is either spectrally positive or spectrally negative .",
    "then the limiting law of @xmath112 as @xmath103 is the residual life distribution associated to @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath127 moreover , @xmath128 if and only if @xmath21 is a spectrally positive process with @xmath129 , in which case @xmath130 and @xmath112 converges to @xmath131 as @xmath103 .",
    "the identity   is easily verified using   and the explicit expressions for @xmath132 in both cases , see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "these explicit expressions also show that in the spectrally negative case we must have @xmath106 , whereas in the spectrally positive case @xmath106 iff @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to @xmath129 and implies that   results in 0 .",
    "it seems unlikely that   holds in general",
    ". it would be interesting to characterize all the lvy processes drifting to @xmath135 for which   is true .",
    "another challenging problem is to express the joint transform @xmath136 ( or , closely related , the joint transform @xmath137 ) through the functions @xmath132 and @xmath138 .",
