    "measurements such as the boomerang and maxima cosmic microwave background radiation power spectra @xcite and type ia supernovae data @xcite suggest that dark matter makes up the bulk of the matter content in the universe .",
    "the agreement between expectations from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and the primordial abundance of the lightest elements @xcite strongly constrains the total baryonic content to be a small value , implying that the majority of the dark matter must be non - baryonic .",
    "the results of other diverse astrophysical measurements based on the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , strong gravitational lensing @xcite and galactic flows @xcite lend powerful support to this picture .",
    "although the nature of dark matter remains unknown , its gravitational effect is pronounced : much of the dynamics of spiral galaxies can not be understood without there being a massive dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "two categories of particle cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates have survived experimental and theoretical scrutiny over time : the lightest supersymmetric particle @xcite and the axion @xcite .",
    "neutrinos and other forms of hot dark matter are thought to contribute insignificantly to closure density and , in any case , can not explain structure formation .",
    "galaxy formation requires cdm , i.e. , dark matter which is already non - relativistic at the time of decoupling .",
    "recently , experiments have begun with the sensitivity either to detect or exclude possible cdm halo candidates . in this paper",
    "we present upper limits on the local axion halo density derived from a search for cold dark matter axions .",
    "the axion is the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson @xcite associated with a new spontaneously broken global u@xmath5(1 ) symmetry invented to suppress strong cp - violation @xcite . there is some model dependence in assigning u@xmath5(1 ) charges to particles : in the ksvz scheme @xcite the axion only couples to quarks at tree level , while in the gut - inspired dfsz model @xcite it couples to both quarks and leptons .",
    "the axion acquires a mass that scales inversely with the ( unknown ) energy scale f@xmath3 at which the u@xmath5(1 ) symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "initially f@xmath3 was presumed to be the electroweak energy scale , but such massive axions were quickly ruled out in , e.g. , beam dump experiments @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was proposed that axions possess such small couplings to matter and radiation that for all practical purposes they would remain forever `` invisible '' . shortly thereafter",
    ", an experiment was proposed that could make even very light axions detectable @xcite . the u.s .",
    "axion search experiment is predicated on this approach whereby the axion converts into a single photon via the inverse primakoff effect .",
    "we use a resonant cavity permeated by a strong static magnetic field , where the large number density of virtual photons from the field enhances axion decay .",
    "the allowed axion mass is constrained to 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 ev .",
    "axions with a mass less than a few ev would have cooled the core of supernova 1987a to such an extent that the distribution of neutrino arrival times would be inconsistent with observation @xcite .",
    "even heavier axions have been ruled out by a variety of astrophysical and terrestrial searches @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the axion mass is less than some value they would have been overproduced in the early universe .",
    "this lower mass limit has been calculated for various axion production mechanisms under different early - universe scenarios , e.g. , `` vacuum realignment '' @xcite , `` string decay '' @xcite and `` wall decay '' @xcite .",
    "the vacuum misalignment mechanism provides a lower mass limit of @xmath8 10@xmath7 ev which we adopt for our search strategy ; the other mechanisms produce a value that is in fairly close agreement .",
    "common to all of these mechanisms is the misalignment of the axion field with respect to the cp - conserving ( minimum energy ) direction when the axion mass turns on during the qcd phase transition .",
    "axions produced in this way are very cold .",
    "their typical momentum was of order the inverse of the horizon scale at the qcd phase transition ( @xmath9 ev )  when the temperature was of order 1 gev .",
    "the cosmological energy density in these cold axions is of order : @xcite @xmath10 hence , if @xmath11 is of order a few @xmath2ev , the mass range where we search , axions contribute significantly to the energy density of the universe .",
    "studies of large scale structure formation support the view that the dominant fraction of matter is in the form of cdm . since cdm necessarily contributes to galactic halos by falling into the gravitational wells of galaxies ( halo axions in our galaxy possess a virial velocity @xmath8 10@xmath12c ) , there is excellent motivation to search for axions as constituents of our galactic halo .",
    "there is a substantial body of evidence that our own galaxy is surrounded by a massive dark halo , though its exact properties are not well - constrained @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to this paper is the local dark matter halo density , whose value depends on the degree of halo flattening as well as the core radii of the various dark matter components . to derive a reliable mass density",
    ", one can turn to parameterizations of the density distribution , rejecting distributions which fail to match observational constraints , such as reproducing the local rotation speed of 200 - 240 kmsec@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a key element of this approach is the use of microlensing data to estimate the fraction of local dark matter that is in the form of compact objects . employing this methodology",
    ", one arrives at a halo density of 9.2@xmath14@xmath1510@xmath16gm/@xmath17 .",
    "if massive compact halo objects ( machos ) comprise a negligible fraction of the local halo density , then the above number is likely an underestimate .",
    "the local halo density may also be enhanced because of our proximity to a possible dark matter caustic @xcite .",
    "our experimental analysis directly constrains the local density of the axionic component of the halo , and as such is independent of astronomical observations and assumptions .",
    "the interaction between axions and photons can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relevant coupling , @xmath20 the axion field and @xmath21 and @xmath22 the electric and magnetic fields , respectively . since @xmath23 is very small in the mass range of interest ,",
    "the spontaneous decay lifetime of an axion to two real photons is vastly greater than the age of the universe . in our experiment ,",
    "located at lawrence livermore national laboratory , a high-@xmath24 resonant cavity and superconducting magnet stimulate axion conversion into a single real photon .",
    "resonant conversion occurs when the cavity resonant frequency equals the axion rest mass .",
    "because this mass is , a priori , unknown , resonant frequencies are changed by moving either ceramic or metallic tuning rods from the wall to the center of the cavity . for a resonant cavity with a loaded quality factor @xmath25 ,",
    "the axion - to - photon conversion power is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cavity volume , @xmath28 the magnetic field strength , @xmath29  the mode - dependent cavity form factor , @xmath30 the reduced coupling constant ( equal to @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 the axion halo density and min@xmath33 the smaller of either the cavity or axion quality factors .",
    "typical values for the first four parameters are 0.2 @xmath34 , 7.5 @xmath35 , 0.6 and 0.97 , respectively .",
    "the copper cavity has a loaded ( critically coupled ) @xmath25 @xmath8 10@xmath36 , whereas @xmath37 , the ratio of the energy to the energy dispersion of the axion , is a factor of ten or so larger over the present frequency range .",
    "the total power that results from eq . [ pa ] is of order @xmath8 @xmath38 w ; our cavity and amplifiers are cooled to a few degrees kelvin to minimize thermal noise .",
    "[ fig1 ] is a schematic of the axion receiver chain .",
    "a microwave signal centered at the cavity resonant frequency and approximately 30 khz wide is coupled out of the cavity by an electric field probe and subsequently mixed down ( in two stages ) to near audio frequencies . at any given frequency",
    "10@xmath39 spectra are averaged by fast - fourier - transform ( fft ) hardware , with each spectrum sampled for 8 ms .",
    "the corresponding nyquist resolution of 125 hz is well matched to the width ( @xmath8 750 hz ) of axions thermalized by interactions with the galactic gravitational potential .",
    "the dicke radiometer equation @xcite dictates the integration time necessary to achieve a specified signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the axion power from eq . [ pa ] ( times a factor which accounts for the external coupling ) , @xmath42 is the noise temperature , @xmath43 is the integration time and @xmath44 is the axion bandwidth ( defined as @xmath45 ) .",
    "since the desired snr is not attained in a single pass over a given frequency interval , data in a single frequency bin are the result of combined data from numerous overlapping spectra .",
    "the snr for this multiple - pass data in the interval 550 @xmath1 f @xmath1 810 mhz is shown in fig .",
    "a second data set was formed by co - adding six neighboring bins into single 750 hz bins suitable for the virialized axion signal . to determine the number of candidate peaks that must be rescanned to obtain an overall confidence limit of @xmath4690%",
    ", artificial peaks are injected into the data via software .",
    "as the cut threshold is lowered , the number of candidate peaks increases rapidly .",
    "a typical cut threshold of 2.3 @xmath47 ( 6-bin ) applied to our data yields numerous candidates which are rescanned to a snr commensurate with the original data .",
    "these data are subsequently added to the original data and from these combined data sets a reduced set of candidates is generated and scanned at the corresponding frequencies .",
    "a final round of data - combining produces a persistent - candidate list .",
    "candidates above a threshold of 3.5 @xmath47 in these data are manually inspected .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment and analyses may be found in @xcite .",
    "we have examined these data for candidates in each of 2.08@xmath1510@xmath48 125 hz and 750 hz bins in the region 550 @xmath1 f @xmath1 810 mhz .",
    "a total of 13712 , 1369 and 34 candidates survived each stage of 6-bin data cuts , respectively .",
    "all 34 persistent candidates have been identified with strong external radio peaks . to derive an upper limit on the axion contribution to the local halo density",
    ", we fix the axion - to - photon coupling @xmath23 at the ksvz level and invert eq .",
    "[ pa ] to calculate @xmath32 as a function power deposited in the cavity and axion mass .",
    "the absence of a persistent signal in these data over this range permits us to impose the limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we plot the excluded axion dark matter halo densities for both ksvz ( lower curve ) and dfsz ( upper curve ) axions as a function of axion mass and frequency over the interval 550 @xmath1 f @xmath1 810 mhz .",
    "the small variations in these density limits represent effective integration times somewhat longer or shorter than that prescribed by eq .",
    "the nominal excluded mass density lies near 0.45 gev/@xmath4 for ksvz axions and 3.0 gev/@xmath4 for dfsz axions .",
    "the former is comparable to the best estimate of the local dark matter halo density .",
    "there is abundant evidence that our own galaxy , like other spiral galaxies , contains a vast dark matter halo .",
    "observation can neither differentiate the various candidates , nor well constrain other parameters that describe the halo , e.g. , the local dark matter density . since 1995 we have been using a single resonant cavity to search for axions which may constitute the local dark matter halo over the frequency interval 550 @xmath1 f @xmath1 810 mhz .",
    "the lack of a persistent signal allows us to exclude the axion from contributing more than 0.45 gev/@xmath4 to the halo dark matter mass density over the mass range of 2.3@xmath4910@xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath11 @xmath1 3.4@xmath5010@xmath7 ev , should axions couple only to hadrons according to the ksvz prescription , with 90% confidence .",
    "this restriction is relaxed to around 3.0 gev/@xmath4 in the dfsz model , also with 90% confidence .",
    "it should be noted that other ksvz- and dfsz - like implementations exist .",
    "some of these models ( including some dfsz - like models ) give rise to coupling constants that are larger than the benchmark ksvz @xmath23 used in this paper @xcite .",
