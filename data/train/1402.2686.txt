    "they may represent sites of massive galaxy formation and their early interaction with the intergalactic medium .",
    "however , the questions of what powers these gigantic gas halos and whether the surrounding gas is outflowing from or infalling into the embedded galaxies are still debated .",
    "the proposed scenarios include photo - ionization by agns @xcite , shock - heated gas by galactic superwinds , cooling radiation from cold - mode accretion , and resonant scattering of ly@xmath0from star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , observations of ly@xmath0blobs currently allow no firm conclusions about their nature .",
    "for example , less than 20% of blobs are found to contain x - ray luminous agn @xcite implying that a powerful agn is not always required for producing the extended halo ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . yet",
    "@xcite argue strongly that most are powered by agn .",
    "it has long been believed that ly@xmath0blobs undergo intense dusty starbursts like submillimeter galaxies @xcite , but recent studies show that most ly@xmath0blobs are not as luminous at rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths as submillimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas content in ly@xmath0blobs has to date remained unconstrained , despite numerous attempts to detect co emission @xcite .",
    "observations of the molecular gas component in these systems are key to determining the physical conditions in the star - forming gas , the star formation efficiency , and constraining various relevant timescales and the role of feedback .",
    "co emission lines are also a useful tool as a tracer of the systemic redshift , without which it is difficult to constrain the gas kinematics within a given system .",
    "for example , previous studies of the same ly@xmath0blob using only ly@xmath0emission line have led to radically different conclusions about the gas kinematics , suggesting that gas is outflowing in stellar or agn winds @xcite , inflowing due to gas accretion @xcite , or even static @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies mainly arise because the systemic velocities of the galaxies within the ly@xmath0blob are not directly measured , but rather need to be assumed ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "while the ly@xmath0profile is broader ( fwhm = 1040kms@xmath3 ) than the co line ( fwhm = 700kms@xmath3 ) , the profile is symmetric and the line center agrees with that of the co line within the uncertainty ( v_ly@xmath46= @xmath47 @xmath6 @xmath48kms@xmath3 ) .    a symmetric single - peaked ly@xmath0profile located exactly at the systemic velocity is not often observed in ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies , which typically show redshifted asymmetric profiles or double - peaked profiles ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite , for exceptions ) .",
    "given the observed single ly@xmath0peak , the possibilities are ( 1 ) the ly@xmath0profile is intrinsically doubled - peaked with similar intensity but two peaks are blended because of low spectral resolution or ( 2 ) the ly@xmath0photons produced in the mips source ( either due to star formation or agn ) are _ not _ seriously affected by the resonant scattering in the medium between the galaxy and the observer .",
    "we find that the first scenario is unlikely because another keck lris spectrum taken with a higher resolution ( @xmath45 = 197kms@xmath3 ) also shows a symmetric ly@xmath0profile .",

    "the second scenario implies that there is less neutral gas at the systemic velocity of the mips source , possibly due to photo - ionization by the ionizing source .",
    "if this is the case , the velocity shift of the ly@xmath0line would reflect gas motions . in either case",
    ", we conclude that the ly@xmath0profile along the los toward galaxy # 36 is consistent with roughly static gas without any significant bulk flows .",

    "we find that the velocity half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm = 1350kms@xmath3 ) on the red side of the profile is roughly twice broader than the blue side ( hwhm = 600kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the profile of the blended doublet lines appears to be similar to the ly@xmath0profile , but the low s / n does not allow us to carry out a detailed analysis",
    ". on the other hand , the optically thin line is redshifted by a small amount ( @xmath51 = 110@xmath625kms@xmath3 ) against the systemic velocity of the # 36 , indicating that the -emitting gas is moving relative to the mips source . in general , it would not be possible to determine whether the region is approaching or receding relative to the mips source because we do not know whether this gas is located in front of or behind the galaxy .",
    "luckily , the ly@xmath0profile from the same region has an asymmetric red wing , indicating that there must be receding material by which the ly@xmath0photons are back - scattered .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is most likely that the -emitting gas near the ly@xmath0-peak is receding in the local velocity frame and located behind the mips source .",
    "the symmetric ly@xmath0profile at the location of the mips source ( i.e. , in aperture 1 ) and the relatively small los velocity offset of the emitting region ( @xmath2 100kms@xmath3 ) together suggest that labd05 does not have extreme outflows as predicted by the hyper-/superwind hypothesis and that shock - heating does not play a major role in powering ly@xmath0emission in this source . this extreme outflow model , which requires an outflow speed up to @xmath21000kms@xmath3 , has been proposed to explain the large extent of ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "of course , we can not completely rule out the possibility of strong outflows oriented tangential to the line - of - sight , but we note that @xcite showed that the /line ratio is inconsistent with shock ionization . a large statistical study of ly@xmath0blob gas kinematics is required to better constrain the gas geometry .",

    "a caveat to our measurement of the line ratio is that the beam sizes for the two transitions are different : @xmath265  and 1.7for co(32 ) and co(54 ) , respectively .",

    "note that in order for labd05 s ratio to be consistent with that of smgs , the co(54 ) flux has to be boosted by @xmath270% , i.e. , more than @xmath21/3 of the total flux has to lie outside the 17 beam .",
    "however , since the gas traced by co(54 ) is likely to be more spatially compact , it is unlikely to be missed ( or resolved - out ) by the larger baselines and the 1.7  beam used here .",
    "future observations of additional co transitions ( e.g. , @xmath11 = 1@xmath120 , 7@xmath126 ) and/or re - observation of co(54 ) line with a compact array configuration are required to further constrain the co seds of labd05 .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we consider two possible scenarios for the co excitation in labd05 and their implications .",
    "first , the labd05 s co emission could arise from a single gas phase , i.e. , the co sed of labd05 can be approximated with a lvg model with a single gas density ( @xmath60 ) and temperature ( @xmath61 ) . in this case",
    ", one can show that the star - forming gas in this ly@xmath0 blob has lower density and/or temperature than what has been observed in qsos and smgs with similar @xmath13 .",
    "low co excitation has been observed for high-@xmath1 galaxies , but only for a handful of near - ir - selected galaxies ( the so - called bzk galaxies ) at @xmath62 that have lower @xmath13(@xmath210@xmath15@xmath16 ) than smgs and labd05 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the co sed of labd05 could be composed of two components ( a ) a dense molecular gas reservoir typical of high-@xmath1 qsos and ( b ) an additional diffuse gas component around this system .",
    "there is now increasing evidence that smgs contain both low and high - excitation components of molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , @xcite show that , in two smgs ( smm j09431 + 4700 and smm j13120 + 4242 ) , a low - excitation component similar to the mw co sed is required to explain the excess of low-@xmath11 emission . however , we find that even in these studies , the low - excitation component is not strong enough to yield a flat @xmath4/@xmath5 line ratio . instead , we find that the flat ( 54)/(32 ) line ratio of labd05 is more similar to that of the local starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "@xcite show that while the central starburst disk of m82 follows an almost thermalized co sed up to @xmath11=4 or 5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cosed ] ) , the total integrated co sed is less excited due to low-@xmath11 transitions dominated by the diffuse molecular gas located in the outflow and in tidal streamers .",
    "their best - fit lvg model shows that if m82 were observed unresolved at high-@xmath1 , it would have @xmath4/@xmath5 = 0.83 similar to the values observed in labd05 .    without the complete co sed , especially the @xmath11=1@xmath120 transition ,",
    "it is not possible to distinguish these two scenarios discussed above .",
    "however , in either case , we conclude that there must be a significant reservoir of low density molecular gas associated with labd05 .",
    "the dust properties of ly@xmath0blobs have been poorly constrained to date because most ly@xmath0blobs have not been detected at mm and submm wavelengths @xcite . using new continuum measurements , we update the far  infrared sed of labd05 . in figure",
    "[ fig : dust_sed ] , we show the 1.9 mm flux density and the upper limit on the 3.2 mm continuum together with the measurements presented in @xcite .",
    "we fit the data with a modified blackbody sed with a dust temperature @xmath63 and an emissivity index @xmath64 .",
    "we find @xmath63 = 54 , 39 and 31k for the fixed emissivity index @xmath64 = 1 , 1.5 and 2 , respectively . while the best - fit @xmath63 and @xmath64 are still degenerate , the colder dust temperature ( @xmath63 @xmath33 41k ) and large emissivity index ( @xmath64 @xmath65 1.5 ) are favoured at the 2@xmath27(96% ) confidence level .",
    "our @xmath13estimate remains almost unchanged from @xcite : @xmath13(401000@xmath10 m ) = ( 3.9@xmath580.5)@xmath14@xmath66@xmath16 .",
    "the updated dust mass is @xmath67 = ( 1.5@xmath580.6)@xmath1410@xmath68@xmath34 .",
    "note that the derived dust mass is sensitive to the choice of @xmath64 : if we adopt @xmath64 = 1.5 , @xmath67 will decrease by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the dust properties within the ly@xmath0blob are more consistent with those of smgs [ ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) = ( 35k , 1.6 ) ] than with those of qsos ( 47k , 1.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , using the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) and a mir color selection technique , @xcite selected hyper - luminous infra - red galaxies ( @xmath13@xmath69 @xmath70  @xmath71@xmath16 ) , some of which show extended ly@xmath0halos over 30100kpc .",
    "these wise - selected ly@xmath0blobs have very warm dust temperatures , @xmath63 = 5085k ( @xmath72 ) , much warmer than labd05 , typical smgs and less luminous dogs .",
    "this warm temperature indicates that the dust is being illuminated by an agn , thus @xcite suggest that these wise - selected hylirgs are experiencing extremely powerful feedback from the agns and that they are in a very brief evolutionary stage between dusty starbursts and optical qsos .",
    "given that the colder dust temperature in labd05 is preferred by our sed fit and that this dust temperature is consistent with those of dogs and smgs rather than agns , we conclude that the dust heating in the fir is likely dominated by star formation in the mips source .",
    "the unusual co excitation in labd05 adversely affects our ability to estimate the molecular gas mass .",
    "if we adopt the mw - like co sed and extrapolate co fluxes to @xmath11 = 1 , labd05 will have @xmath73 = 1.6@xmath1410@xmath74 kkms@xmath3pc@xmath75and @xmath76= 6.4@xmath1410@xmath74(@xmath77/4.0)@xmath34(fig .",
    "[ fig : cosed ] ) . here",
    "we adopt the nominal mw - like co  to  h@xmath78conversion factor . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the gas is still fully thermalized up to @xmath11 = 3 , we obtain @xmath76= 3.5@xmath1410@xmath79(@xmath77/0.8)@xmath34for @xmath73 = 4.4@xmath1410@xmath79 kkms@xmath3pc@xmath75assuming a ulirg - like conversion factor .",
    "the actual gas mass @xmath76and @xmath73 values for labd05 are expected to lie between these two extreme values .",
    "for these two @xmath76estimates , we obtain the gas - to - dust mass ratios , @xmath80/@xmath67 = 20 and 370 , which span almost the entire observed range of local group galaxies @xcite and local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath76estimate derived from the mw - like co sed is comparable to or even larger than the dynamical mass estimated from the co line - width .",
    "we conclude that putting constraints on the co(10 ) line luminosity of labd05 and carrying out more detailed modeling of the co sed will be critical for constraining the properties of star formation in this ly@xmath0blob .",
    "with new information on the gas kinematics in hand , we construct physical models for labd05 in this section . in the following , we begin by summarizing the observational findings obtained from this work as well as previous studies @xcite , which a successful model must be able to explain :    1 .",
    "the ly@xmath0profile around the mips source ( galaxy # 36 ) is symmetric and peaks precisely at the systemic velocity of the galaxy as traced by co emission .",
    "2 .   the -emitting gas ( located @xmath220kpc away from the mips source )",
    "is receding with @xmath2100kms@xmath3with respect to the mips source .",
    "3 .   the ly@xmath0profiles become broader , more asymmetric , and more redshifted with increasing distance from the mips source @xcite .",
    "there are no galaxies detected in the uv - to - fir at the peak of the ly@xmath0emission , which is located at @xmath212kpc from the mips source @xcite .",
    "the unknowns are ( 1 ) the mass distribution in labd05 and ( 2 ) how to interpret the relative motion between the mips source and the -emitting gas .",
    "depending on the answers to these two unknowns , we consider the following two models for labd05 .",
    "the first model assumes that the mass ( gas and dark matter ) is centered on the mips source and that the /ly@xmath0-emitting gas is outflowing from this galaxy . in this picture ,",
    "photo - ionization by an obscured agn ( the mips source ) is the dominant source for the extended ly@xmath0emission .",
    "the power - law mir sed of the mips source and no obvious sign of agn activity in the optical spectrum ( e.g. , broad emission lines and high ionization lines ) indicates that the mips source might contain an obscured agn @xcite . note that star formation is likely to heat the dust within the mips source ( confined within @xmath27kpc ) , but the radiation from the agn provides energy for the ly@xmath0emission over @xmath2100kpc scale . as the mips source , plausibly the most massive member of labd05 , is also located near the greatest concentration of galaxies",
    ", it likely lies at or near the center of the gravitational potential . a cone of radiation from the agn photo - ionizes the surrounding gas toward the south ",
    "west part of the ly@xmath0blob .",
    "the presence of and emission near the ly@xmath0peak suggests that this ionizing radiation should be hard .",
    "since we do not observe any ly@xmath0or emission towards the northern side , in this model , the radiation from the agn must be anisotropic .",
    "note that this kind of anisotropic ionizing radiation is common among high - redshift qsos ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . around the agn ,",
    "the gas is highly ionized , leading to ly@xmath0being less affected by resonant scattering off of neutral gas . therefore",
    ", the ly@xmath0profile is single - peaked and symmetric for this los .",
    "the surrounding gas is outflowing with a relatively low speed ( @xmath2100kms@xmath3 in projection ) from the mips source due to either star - formation or agn - driven winds .",
    "further from the agn , the gas becomes more neutral , thus the ly@xmath0profiles become broader and more asymmetric . the observed monotonic velocity shear across the ly@xmath0halo could be explained if the outflowing gas is accelerating ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or radiative transfer effects , as the ly@xmath0lines become more redshifted due to higher optical depths at larger radii . in this scenario ,",
    "the diffuse molecular gas might represent gas entrained in an outflow from the mips source .",
    "the major challenge to this model is the fact that the ly@xmath0and emission peaks are not located at the location of the mips source where illumination from the agn and the gas density should be highest . given that the ly@xmath0surface brightness depends on complicated radiative transfer effects , the anisotropic geometry of the radiation cone , and the varying ionization state of the gas , it is not clear whether the observed ly@xmath0surface brightness distribution can be reproduced by this model .",
    "detailed ly@xmath0radiative transfer calculations are required .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the gas in labd05 is distributed symmetrically with a density profile that scales with the surface brightness profile of ly@xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the potential is centered around the location of the ly@xmath0peak and the galaxies are somehow displaced from the center of the potential . because there are no galaxies directly associated with this ly@xmath0peak , the baryonic component is largely in the gas phase .",
    "the kinematics of the gas are reflected in the observed ly@xmath0profiles .",
    "the galaxies are forming from this halo gas , therefore they closely follow the motions of the gas .",
    "in other words , the galaxies have only small peculiar velocities relative to the overall gas kinematics .",
    "the mips source is one of these galaxies forming within the nebula , thus explaining the lack of any significant velocity offset between ly@xmath0and co. it is undergoing a starburst and possibly agn formation , and is supplying ionizing photons to the gas . in this case , the ionization from the mips source could be isotropic and there could be also other ionizing sources .",
    "for example , @xcite found _ diffuse _ continuum emission near the region which , if powered by spatially extended star formation , could suggest an additional source of ionization . in this model , the ly@xmath0emission",
    "is observed only on one side of the agn because the photo - ionization is bounded by the gas distribution .",
    "the low density molecular gas around the mips source may indicate that molecular gas is forming within the mips source and fueling the star formation activity .",
    "in other words , these observations show a massive galaxy in the process of forming from the gas with rapid dust and molecular gas formation .",
    "the major challenge in this model is how to explain the observed ly@xmath0velocity structure , in particular , why the line - width of ly@xmath0varies across the halo rather than being broadest at the center of the nebula .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear why the galaxies and gas in this system are spatially offset .    with the limited kinematic data , it is difficult to discriminate between these two models .",
    "furthermore , it is still possible that there is an obscured source at the location of the ly@xmath0peak just below the detection limit of our mm observations ( sfr @xmath33 260@xmath34yr@xmath3 ; 3@xmath27 ) .",
    "alternately , a weak radio - jet from the mips source might be responsible for the offset morphology between ly@xmath0and member galaxies , similar to what has been observed in high - redshift radio galaxies . to reveal the nature of labd05 , deeper spectroscopic observations with high spectral resolution and deeper ( sub)mm / radio continuum observations will be required to further constrain the kinematics of the ly@xmath0- and -emitting gas and to search for possible energy sources .",
    "we have obtained iram pdbi observations of the co @xmath11 = 3@xmath122 and @xmath11 = 5@xmath124 line transitions from a @xmath1=2.7 ly@xmath0blob ( labd05 ) in order to investigate the molecular gas content and kinematics , to determine the location of the dominant energy source , and to study the physical conditions of star - forming regions within the ly@xmath0blob .",
    "we detect co line emission from the molecular gas associated with this ly@xmath0blob .",
    "the co line emission and the dust continuum are detected at the location of a strong mips source , which is offset by @xmath21.5  ( 12kpc in projection ) from the peak of ly@xmath0surface brightness distribution .",
    "neither the co line nor the dust continuum emission is resolved with our 1.7  beam , showing that the molecular gas and dust are confined to within a @xmath27kpc region around the mips source .",
    "in addition , no millimeter continuum source is found at the location of the ly@xmath0peak , excluding the presence of a compact source of hidden star formation at sfr @xmath65 260@xmath34yr@xmath3 which might be directly responsible for the ly@xmath0emission .",
    "the co line spectra show that the mips source is indeed located at the same redshift as the extended ly@xmath0emission and that it is a massive galaxy ( @xmath37 = 37@xmath1410@xmath74@xmath34 ) based on the broad co line - width ( fwhm = 700kms@xmath3 ) .    combined with keck / lris longslit spectroscopy of ly@xmath0and ,",
    "we constrain the kinematics of the extended gas using the co emission as the best tracer of the systemic redshift . at the position of the mips source , the ly@xmath0profile is symmetric and its line center agrees with those of the co lines .",
    "this implies that there are no significant bulk flows and the photo - ionization from the mips source might be the dominant source of the ly@xmath0emission . near the peak of the ly@xmath0nebula , the gas is slowly receding ( @xmath2100kms@xmath3 ) with respect to the mips source , thus disfavoring the hyper-/superwind hypothesis where extreme galactic winds are responsible for the extended ly@xmath0emission .",
    "however , we note that we can not rule out the possibility that gas flow within labd05 is tangential to our los .",
    "we find that a significantly sub - thermal line ratio between the two co transitions , @xmath4/@xmath5 = 0.97 @xmath6 0.21 [ @xmath56/@xmath57 = 0.35 @xmath6 0.08 ] . this line ratio is lower than the average values found in high-@xmath1 smgs and qsos , but is consistent with the value found in the center of the milky way .",
    "this line ratio indicates that there is a large reservoir of low - density molecular gas that could be spread over the vicinity of the mips source .",
    "observations of co(76 ) and co(10 ) lines with higher spatial resolution are required to further constrain the properties of the star - forming regions within this ly@xmath0blob .",

    "<S> we present iram plateau de bure interferometer observations of the co(32 ) and co(54 ) line transitions from a ly@xmath0blob at @xmath1 @xmath2 2.7 in order to investigate the gas kinematics , determine the location of the dominant energy source , and study the physical conditions of the molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> co line and dust continuum emission are detected at the location of a strong mips source that is offset by @xmath21.5  from the ly@xmath0peak . </S>",
    "<S> neither of these emission components is resolved with the 1.7beam , showing that the gas and dust are confined to within @xmath27kpc from this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> no millimeter source is found at the location of the ly@xmath0peak , ruling out a central compact source of star formation as the power source for the ly@xmath0emission . </S>",
    "<S> combined with a spatially - resolved spectrum of ly@xmath0and , we constrain the kinematics of the extended gas using the co emission as a tracer of the systemic redshift . near the mips source </S>",
    "<S> , the ly@xmath0profile is symmetric and its line center agrees with that of co line , implying that there are no significant bulk flows and that the photo - ionization from the mips source might be the dominant source of the ly@xmath0emission . in the region near the ly@xmath0peak , </S>",
    "<S> the gas is slowly receding ( @xmath2100kms@xmath3 ) with respect to the mips source , thus making the hyper-/superwind hypothesis unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> we find a sub - thermal line ratio between two co transitions , @xmath4/@xmath5 = 0.97 @xmath6 0.21 . this line ratio is lower than the average values found in high-@xmath1 smgs and qsos , but consistent with the value found in the galactic center , suggesting that there is a large reservoir of low - density molecular gas that is spread over the mips source and its vicinity . </S>"
