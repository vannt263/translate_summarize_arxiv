    "+ the generalization of these results to arbitrary spin quantum numbers @xmath4 is due to shastry and sutherland @xcite . a different generalization of majumdar - ghosh rings has been given by pimpinelli @xcite and re - discovered by kumar @xcite who extended the coupling within the @xmath0 ring to @xmath5-nearest neighbors with strengths @xmath6 .",

    "+ in view of the abundance of examples of dgs systems in the literature i am not primarily interested in new examples but will try to characterize the class of _ all _ examples .",
    "unfortunately , i have achieved a complete characterization only in the case of classical spin systems .",
    "this and the partial results for quantum systems are contained in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "after the general definitions ( subsection 2.1 ) a necessary condition is formulated ( theorem 1 in subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "it says that @xmath2 will be an eigenstate of the spin hamiltonian iff a certain balance condition for the four coupling constants between any two dimers is satisfied . for classical spin systems",
    "this balance condition can be strengthened to the condition of uniform coupling between any pair of dimers ( theorem 2 ) . + in section 3 i will give sufficient conditions for dgs systems and enumerate four special classes of examples .",
    "as mentioned above , systems of these classes can be superposed by positive linear combinations in order to form new dgs systems . here",
    "we identify a spin system with its matrix @xmath12 of exchange parameters and thus understand  addition \" of systems as the addition of the corresponding matrices . hence classical spin systems and quantum spin systems with any @xmath4 are not distinguished at the level of @xmath12-matrices , but , of course , the definition of classical and quantum dgs systems is different .",
    "+ subsection 3.1 describes  uniform pyramids \" which are systems of @xmath1 dimers with uniform coupling between all @xmath13 spins ( the base of the pyramid ) plus an extra dimer one spin of which ( the vertex of the pyramid ) is uniformly coupled to the other @xmath13 spins .",
    "these pyramids are dgs systems for arbitrary @xmath4 if the uniform coupling constants are suitably chosen .",
    "another class of dgs systems is provided by small neighborhoods of unconnected dimer systems ( subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "the radius @xmath14 of the neighborhood decreases with @xmath4 .",

    "+ for small @xmath1 and @xmath4 the class of dgs systems can , in principle , be explicitly determined .",
    "the method is sketched in subsection [ sec3.3 ] and the result for @xmath15 is given in the form of four inequalities for polynomial functions of the involved four coupling constants .",
    "recall that for a classical dgs system the coupling between any two pairs of dimers must be uniform . hence it is possible to encode the structure of such a system by an @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 instead of the @xmath18 matrix @xmath12 .",

    "if a coupling matrix @xmath12 belongs to a classical dgs system , then it also belongs to a quantum dgs system for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "hence theorem 3 defines a forth class of special dgs systems .",
    "+ in section 4 i will consider two examples . the first one ( subsection 4.1 ) consists of two dimers which are weakly coupled in a balanced but not uniform way .",
    "if @xmath19 is the maximal coupling strength such that the quantum system with spin quantum number @xmath4 is still dgs , then it follows that @xmath20 for @xmath21 since the classical system is not dgs for all @xmath22 . + the second example ( subsection 4.2 ) consists of three dimers and , due to symmetry assumptions , normalization and the balance condition , two independent coupling constants , say @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is still possible to exactly calculate the convex set of dgs systems in the @xmath25plane and to illustrate the subsets defined in section 3 for this example .",
    "+ for the sake of readability of the paper all proofs of the previously formulated theorems and propositions are deferred to section 5 .",
    "in section 6 we investigate the geometric structure of the set @xmath26 of dgs systems , represented as the set of the corresponding @xmath12-matrices .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath26 is a _ proper , convex , generating cone _ in the linear space of all symmetric matrices satisfying the balance condition .",
