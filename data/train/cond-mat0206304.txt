    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is still the only superconducting layered perovskite besides the cuprates@xcite ; however , in contrast to the cuprate high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   develops in a well defined fermi - liquid state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the superconducting state and the pairing mechanism in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   are highly unconventional .",
    "the present interest in this compound goes far beyond the simple comparison with the cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the superconducting transition temperature on non - magnetic impurities suggests a non - phonon mechanism @xcite . it is further established that superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "is made of spin - triplet cooper pairs and breaks time - reversal symmetry @xcite . the strongest experimental argument for that can be found in the uniform susceptibility measured either by the nmr - knight - shift or polarized neutrons experiments @xcite and in the appearance of spontaneous fields in the superconducting state reported by @xmath5sr @xcite .",
    "a spin - triplet p - wave order parameter had been proposed before these experiments @xcite , in the idea that superconductivity arrises from a dominant interaction with ferromagnetic fluctuations in analogy to superfluid @xmath6he .",
    "rice and sigrist stressed the comparison with the perovskites srruo@xmath7 and caruo@xmath7 which order ferromagnetically or are nearly ferromagnetic respectively @xcite .",
    "evidence for ferromagnetic fluctuations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   was inferred from nmr - experiments : imai et al . found that @xmath8 of the o- and of the ru - nmr exhibit a similar temperature dependence and interpreted that this could be only due to ferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic susceptibility in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is enhanced when compared with the band structure calculation but only weakly , in particular its temperature dependence remains flat @xcite .",
    "there exist also layered ruthenates which are very close to ferromagnetic order at low temperatures : the purest sr@xmath7ru@xmath0o@xmath9   samples show meta - magnetism and samples with somehow less quality even order ferromagnetically @xcite . a highly enhanced susceptibility pointing to a ferromagnetic instability",
    "is also observed in the phase diagram of ca@xmath10sr@xmath11ruo@xmath1   @xcite but for a rather high ca concentration , ca@xmath12sr@xmath13ruo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in these nearly ordered layered ruthenates , the susceptibility is about two orders of magnitude higher than that in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   and strongly temperature dependent .",
    "some doubt about the unique role of ferromagnetism in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   arose from the strong moment antiferromagnetic order observed in the ca analog @xcite , which inspired mazin and singh to perform a calculation of the generalized susceptibility based on the electronic band structure @xcite .",
    "surprisingly they found that the dominating part is neither ferro- nor antiferromagnetic but incommensurate .",
    "the fermi - surface in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is well studied both by experiment @xcite and by theory @xcite with satisfactory agreement .",
    "three bands are contributing to the fermi - surface which may be roughly attributed to the three t@xmath14-levels , the d@xmath15- , d@xmath16- and d@xmath17-orbitals , occupied by the four 4d - electrons of ru@xmath18 .",
    "the d@xmath15-orbitals hybridize in the xy - plane and , therefore , form a band with two - dimensional character , @xmath19-band .",
    "in contrast , the d@xmath17 and the d@xmath16 orbitals may hybridize only along the x and the y - directions , respectively , and form quasi - one - dimensional bands , @xmath20-band   and @xmath21-band , with flat sheets in the fermi - surface , @xmath20-sheet   and @xmath21-sheet .",
    "the latter give rise to strong nesting and enhanced susceptibility for @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xcite . along the diagonal",
    "both effects strengthen each other yielding a pronounced peak in the susceptibility at @xmath24 . using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins )",
    "we have perfectly confirmed this nesting scenario @xcite . the dynamic susceptibility at moderate energies is indeed dominated by the incommensurate fluctuations occurring very close to the calculated position at @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we found a pronounced temperature dependence which can explain the temperature dependence of both ru- and o-@xmath26-nmr @xcite .    in the meanwhile ,",
    "several groups have worked on theories where superconductivity is related to the incommensurate fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these theories , however , do not yet give an explanation for the fine structure of the order parameter .",
    "specific heat data on the highest quality samples clearly indicates the presence of line nodes in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "ultrasonic @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite results would disagree with vertical line nodes which leave horizontal line nodes as the only possible ones .",
    "zhitomirsky and rice @xcite assume that superconductivity is transferred from the @xmath19-band   to the @xmath20-band   and @xmath21-band   by a proximity effect and get a conclusive explanation for the horizontal line nodes . in this model superconductivity",
    "should be mainly related to excitations associated with the active @xmath19-band , which so far have not been characterized .",
    "therefore , it appears still interesting to further deepen the study of the magnetic fluctuations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  .    in this paper",
    "we report on additional ins studies in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   in the normal as well as in the superconducting phase .",
    "we present a more quantitative analysis of the incommensurate fluctuations related to the @xmath20-sheet   and @xmath21-sheet   and discuss the possible contributions due to the two - dimensional @xmath19-band .",
    "single crystals of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   were grown by a floating zone method in an image furnace ; they exhibit the superconducting transition at t@xmath27=0.7 , 1.35 and 1.43k and have volumes of about 450mm@xmath6 each . since most of the measurements were performed in the normal phase , where the differences in t@xmath27 should not affect the magnetic excitation spectrum , we aligned the three crystals together in order to gain counting statistics in the ins experiments .",
    "count rates in the ruthenates experiments are relatively small already due to the steeper decrease of the ru magnetic form - factor with increasing scattering vector . for the measurements below and across the superconducting transition we mounted only the two crystals with relatively high",
    "t@xmath27 together .",
    "the mounting of the two or three crystals was achieved with individual goniometers yielding a total mosaic spread below 0.5 degrees .",
    "we used the thermal triple axis spectrometer 1 t installed at the orphe - reactor ( saclay , france ) in order to further characterize the scattering in the normal state .",
    "the instrument was operated with double focusing pyrolithic graphite ( pg ) monochromator and analyzer , in addition pg filters in front of the analyzer were used to suppress higher order contamination , the final neutron energy was fixed at 14.7mev .",
    "all diaphragms determining the beam paths were opened more widely than usually in order to relax @xmath28-resolution , since the magnetic signals are not sharp in @xmath28-space . in most experiments ,",
    "the scattering plane was defined by ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) directions in order to span any directions within the ( ab ) plane .",
    "an additional experiment has been made with the ( 1,1,0 ) and ( 0,0,1 ) directions with the plane to follow the spin fluctuations along the c@xmath29 axis .",
    "studies aiming at the response in the magnetic excitation spectrum on the opening of the superconducting gap require an energy resolution better than the expected value for twice the superconducting gap .",
    "therefore , such experiment is better placed on a cold triple - axis spectrometer even though this implies a sensitive reduction in the flux .",
    "we have made preliminary studies using the cold spectrometers 4f at the orphe reactor and a more extensive investigation on the spectrometer in14 at the ill .",
    "these instruments possess pg monochromators ( double at 4f and focusing at in14 ) and focusing analyzers .",
    "the final neutron energy was fixed at @xmath30= 5 mev on both cold source spectrometers where a be filter has been employed to cut down higher - order wavelength neutrons .",
    "cooling was achieved by use of a dilution- and a he@xmath6-insert at 4f and in14 respectively .",
    "the magnetic neutron cross section per formula unit is written in terms of the fourier transform of the spin correlation function , @xmath31 ( labels @xmath32 correspond to x , y , z ) as @xcite ;    @xmath33    where k@xmath34 and k@xmath35 are the incident and final neutron wave vectors , @xmath36=0.292 barn , @xmath37 is the magnetic form factor .",
    "the scattering - vector @xmath28 can be split into @xmath28 = @xmath38+@xmath39 , where @xmath38 lies in the first brillouin - zone and @xmath39 is a zone - center .",
    "all reciprocal space coordinates @xmath40 are given in reduced lattice units of 2@xmath41/a or 2@xmath41/c .",
    "according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the spin correlation function is related to the imaginary part of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility times the by one enhanced bose - factor : @xmath42 in case of weak anisotropy , which is usually observed in a paramagnetic state , @xmath43 reduces to @xmath44 .",
    "note that for itinerant magnets , anisotropy of the susceptibility can occur due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath45 can be described by the ru@xmath46 magnetic form factor in first approximation .",
    "once determined , the magnetic response is converted to the dynamical susceptibility and calibrated in absolute units by comparison with acoustic phonons , using a standard procedure depicted in @xcite .",
    "at low temperature sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   exhibits well defined fermi - liquid properties ; therefore , it seems appropriate to assess its magnetic excitations within a rpa approach basing on the band structure .",
    "density functional calculations in lda were performed by several groups and yield good agreement with the fermi - surface determined in de - haas van alphen experiments .",
    "the bare non - interacting susceptibility , @xmath47 , can be obtained by summing the matrix elements for an electron hole excitation @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath490 , @xmath50 is the fermi distribution function and @xmath51 the quasiparticle dispersion relation .",
    "this was first calculated by mazin and singh @xcite under the assumption that only excitations within the same orbital character are relevant ( the matrix - elements @xmath52 are equal to one or zero ) .",
    "mazin and singh predicted the existence of peaks in the real part of the bare susceptibility at @xmath53=0 due to the pronounced nesting of the @xmath20-bands and @xmath21-bands .",
    "these peaks were calculated at ( 0.33,0.33,0 ) and experimentally confirmed very close to this position at @xmath54=(0.3,0.3,0 ) , see fig .",
    "1 . in addition to the peaks at @xmath54 , this study finds ridges of high susceptibility at ( 0.3 , @xmath55,0 ) for @xmath56 and some shoulder for @xmath57 .",
    "the susceptibility gets enhanced through the stoner - like interaction which is treated in rpa by : @xmath58 with the @xmath38-dependent interaction @xmath59 . for the nesting positions mazin and singh",
    "get @xmath60=1.02 , which already implies a diverging susceptibility and a magnetic instability .    in fig .",
    "1 we show a scheme of the ( hk0)-plane in reciprocal space . due to the body centering in space - group i4/mmm any ( hkl)-bragg - points have to fulfill the condition ( h+k+l ) even ; ( 100 ) for instance is not a zone - center but a z - point .",
    "the boundaries of the brillouin - zones are included in the figure .",
    "large filled circles indicate the position of the incommensurate peaks as predicted by the band - structure and as observed in our previous work .",
    "the thick lines connecting four of them correspond to the ridges of enhanced susceptibility also suggested in reference @xcite .    in the meanwhile several groups have performed similar calculations which all agree on the dominant incommensurate fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however there are serious discrepancies concerning the detailed structure of the spin susceptibility away from @xmath54",
    ". these discrepancies mainly rely on the parameters used to describe the electronic band structure , on the choice of @xmath61 and on the inclusion of more subtle effects such as spin - orbit or hund couplings .    in order to compare directly to the ins experiments , see equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it is necessary to perform the rpa analysis by taking into account both real and imaginary part of the susceptibility .",
    "morr et al .",
    "@xcite report such calculations obtained by fitting the band structure to the arpes results @xcite .",
    "they find in addition to the peak at @xmath54   quite strong intensity near @xmath62=(0.3,0.5,0 ) , ( the middle of the walls , see fig .",
    "1 ) , which is even comparable to that at @xmath54   in the bare susceptibility .",
    "similar results were obtained in references @xcite .",
    "ng and sigrist @xcite find much less spectral weight in the ridges at ( 0.3 , @xmath55 ) for @xmath56 but stronger shoulders @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , they calculate the separate contribution of the @xmath19-band   which does not show a particular enhancement in the ferromagnetic @xmath38-range but is little structured .",
    "eremin et al .",
    "@xcite calculate the susceptibility taking into account strong hybridization and obtain results somehow differnt from the other groups .",
    "they find a strong signal at @xmath62 ; in addition there is some enhancement of the susceptibility related to the van - hove singularity of the @xmath19-band .",
    "this contribution occurs quite close to the zone center at @xmath63=(0.15,0,0 ) .",
    "we have performed the full rpa analysis basing on the lda band structure reported in reference @xcite in order to accompany our experimental investigations .",
    "we first calculate the bare electron hole susceptibility @xmath64 from the usual expression , equation ( 3 ) . for the band energies",
    "@xmath65 we use the expressions of mazin and singh @xcite for the three mutually non hybridizing tight - binding bands in the vicinity of the fermi level : @xmath66 we also used the crude approximation that matrix - elements for transitions between bands of the same character are equal to one and others zero .",
    "the * q*-dependent `` ferromagnetic '' interaction ( stoner factor ) i(*q * ) is taken to be equal to ( following reference @xcite ) : @xmath67 . with this choice of i(*q * ) the calculated static susceptibility @xmath68 is slightly lower than the measured one .",
    "if i(*q * ) is chosen larger an instability appears at the incommensurate wave vector .",
    "our results for the imaginary part of the generalized susceptibility at an energy transfer of 6mev are given in the lower part of figure 1 .",
    "besides the dominating nesting peak near @xmath54   there is a further contribution near ( 0.15,0.15,0 ) which is related to the @xmath19-sheet .",
    "in contrast we find a small susceptibility near @xmath62 and for ( @xmath69,0,0 ) with small values of @xmath69 .",
    "since the @xmath38-position of the magnetic excitations were found not to depend on energy , it is easiest to observe the signal in ins by scanning at constant energy .",
    "the scan paths are included in fig .",
    "1 , they are purely transverse or rocking - like , * r*-scan , along a [ 100]-direction , * x*-scans , and in diagonal direction , * d*-scans .",
    "the observed signal is rather broad and , therefore , the scans performed are extremely wide covering complete cuts through the brillouin - zone .",
    "this further implies that the background ( bg ) may be non - constant at least sloping .",
    "also , the signals are relatively weak compared to typical triple axis spectrometry problems ; this implies that sample independent bg - contributions which usually are negligible play a role .",
    "2 presents the results of * d*-scans at different temperatures clearly demonstrating the gain in statistics compared to the previous work @xcite . the magnetic intensity shown in fig .",
    "2 disappears upon heating but this effect gets partially compensated by the gain through the bose - factor .",
    "the fact that the incommensurate signal around a zone - center and around a z - point , ( 001 ) , are equivalent already indicates that the coupling between ruo@xmath0-planes is negligible , i.e. that in - phase and out - of - phase coupling are indistinguishable .",
    "the 2d - character has been directly documented by servant et al .",
    "@xcite who found no q@xmath70-dependence at ( 0.3,0.3,@xmath71 ) for q@xmath70 between -0.5 and 0.5 . we find the same result by varying q@xmath70 in a broader range between 2 and 5 in ( 0.3,0.3,q@xmath70 ) , see fig .",
    "this 2d character is actually surprising since the dispersion relation of the quasi - particles involved in the computation of @xmath72 is not purely 2d @xcite .",
    "one may therefore expect weak spin correlation along the @xmath73-direction .",
    "recently , it has been shown that these fluctuations freeze out into a spin density wave ( sdw ) ordering by a minor replacement of ru by ti @xcite . in this ordering a very short correlation length along the c - direction nicely reflects the 2d - character of the incommensurate inelastic signal .",
    "the sdw propagation vector finally favored in the static ordering corresponds to the out - of - phase coupling between neighboring layers .",
    "this static interlayer - coupling might be even due to the cdw always coupled to a sdw , which , however , has not yet been discovered so far .",
    "one may add that the stripe ordering in la@xmath74sr@xmath75nio@xmath1 , which differs from the sr@xmath0ru@xmath76ti@xmath77o@xmath1-case in many aspects but nevertheless may be considered as a mixed sdw - cdw - ordering , occurs at the same propagation vector @xcite .    the wider q@xmath70-dependence of the incommensurate signal shown in fig .",
    "3 can give information about the anisotropy of the excitation , since ins measures only the spin component perpendicular to q. we consider the diagonal susceptibility @xmath78 with tetragonal symmetry @xmath79 . the measured intensity",
    "is then given by : @xmath80 which implies that the observations at high q@xmath70 favor the in - plane component of the susceptibility .",
    "for the detailed analysis , one has to compare with the form factor . in the figure",
    "we show the q@xmath70-dependence assuming that spin density is localized at the ru - site and may be modeled by the form factor of ru@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the ru - form - factor dependence underestimates the signal at higher q@xmath70-values ; however , the ru@xmath81-form factor is certainly a too crude approximation .",
    "measurements of the spin - density distribution induced by an external field have not been very precise due to the small magnetic susceptibility and the resulting small moment in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , in ca@xmath12sr@xmath13ruo@xmath1   which exhibits ferromagnetic ordering below 1k and whose low temperature susceptibility is about two orders of magnitude higher than that in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  @xcite , it has been possible to study the field induced spin - density distribution .",
    "these experiments revealed an extremely high amount of spin - density at the oxygen position , about one third of the total moment @xcite and an orbital contribution at the ru - site .",
    "by use of the ca@xmath12sr@xmath13ruo@xmath1  spin - density distribution one obtains a good description of the @xmath82-dependence given in fig .",
    "3 . however , the form - factor in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   should be even more complex .",
    "since the main contribution originates from the flat @xmath83-orbitals @xcite , there must be an anisotropy in the effective form factor which indeed was observed in ca@xmath12sr@xmath13ruo@xmath1@xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the anisotropy in the form - factor has to be compensated by some weak anisotropy in the spin susceptibility , i.e. by an enhanced out - of - plane component .",
    "such susceptibility anisotropy corresponds to the orientation of the spins in the sdw ordering phase in sr@xmath0ru@xmath76ti@xmath77o@xmath1   @xcite where the spins are aligned parallel to the c - direction and also to the conclusion deduced by ng and sigrist from the influence of spin - orbit coupling in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite .    _",
    " shoulder of the incommensurate peak  _ in order to examine the shape of the incommensurate peak and to verify the existence of the ridges of additional nesting intensity or the additional peak @xmath62 , reported in different band structure analyzes @xcite , we have scanned across @xmath54   along the [ 100 ] or [ 010]-directions , * y*-scans see fig .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "one can recognize that the incommensurate peak is not symmetric but exhibits always a shoulder to the lower @xmath69-side in absolute units .",
    "the shoulder is seen in many scans in reversed focusing conditions of the spectrometer configuration excluding an experimental artefact .",
    "our full rpa calculation nicely agrees with such shoulder ; the thin line in fig .",
    "4 shows the calculated imaginary part of the susceptibility at the energy transfer of the scan and describes the observed signal perfectly besides a minor offset in the position of the incommensurate signal .",
    "in contrast , neither the experiment nor our full rpa analysis yield significant intensity in the ridges , i.e. the range ( @xmath69,0.3,0 ) with @xmath84 , see fig . 1 and 4 .",
    "in particular an intensity at @xmath85 only three times weaker than that at @xmath54   would have been easily detected experimentally .",

    "there is evidence for a strong and sharp enhancement of any susceptibility exactly at the zone - center pointing to a ferromagnetic instability @xcite",

    "however , this contribution is not sharply peaked at the @xmath91-point but forms a broad square or a circle .",
    "the signal roughly agrees with the prediction that the @xmath19-band   yields magnetic excitations near the zone - center .    since the sloping background is a major obstacle to analyze the additional contributions we tried to compensate these effects by scanning from @xmath28=(0 1 0 ) along the four diagonals , which are illustrated in fig . 1 , and by summing the four scans .",

    "the spectral weight at @xmath28=(0.15,0.15,0 ) relative to that of the nesting feature increases upon increasing temperature or energy as it is expected for a signal directly related to the van hove singularity .",
    "due to the agreement between the ins results and the rpa calculations , we suggest to interpret the additional broad scattering as being magnetic in origin ; however , a polarized neutron study would be highly desirable .",

    "the energy and temperature dependence has been studied in more detail by performing *",
    "r*-scans across the incommensurate position , since in this mode the background is almost flat .",
    "however , due to phonon contributions we could not extend the measurements to energies higher than 12mev , which is slightly below the lowest phonon frequency observed at @xmath54   @xcite . in particular the large scans required to cover the broad magnetic signal prevent any analysis within the phonon band frequency range on a non - polarized thermal triple axis spectrometer .",

    "the transition is governed by a single parameter related to the stoner - enhancement at the ordering wave - vector , @xmath102 .",
    "the characteristic entities of the magnetic excitations are then given by :    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105    when the system approaches the phase transition , the unique parameter @xmath106 diminishes , which behavior should be observable in all three parameters .",
    "equations ( 11 - 13 ) imply a sharpening of the magnetic response in @xmath38-space as well as in energy and a divergence of the susceptibility at the ordering vector .",
    "7 qualitatively confirms this picture .",
    "all the relevant parameters , see the right scales in fig.7 , decrease towards low temperature .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is approaching the sdw transition related to the nesting effects upon cooling . however , all these parameters do not vanish completely but remain finite even at the lowest temperatures in agreement with the well known fact that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   does not exhibit magnetic ordering .",
    "in particular the magnetic scattering remains rather broad in @xmath38-space implying a short correlation length of just 3 - 4 lattice spacings .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic excitations corroborate our recent finding that only a small amount of ti is sufficient to induce sdw magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "since sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is close to a quantum critical point it is tempting to analyze whether the excitation spectrum is governed by some @xmath107-scaling , as it has been claimed for the high temperature superconductor la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath1  @xcite and for cecu@xmath108au@xmath109 @xcite .",
    "one would expect that the susceptibility is given by : @xmath110    in fig .",
    "8 we plot the @xmath111-data of fig . 7 and that obtained previously as a function of temperature @xcite against @xmath107 for @xmath20=0.75 and 1.0 .",
    "only the data at higher temperatures agree with the scaling concept , demonstrating that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is not a quantum critical point .",
    "the schematic inset may illustrate the phase diagram , where the magnetic transition is determined by some parameter @xmath112 ( external pressure or composition ) . at the critical transition one would observe quantum criticality in the entire temperature range , whereas for r - values where the transition is suppressed quantum criticality is observed only at higher temperatures .",
    "one then may expect a cross - over temperature t@xmath29 where the system transforms from an unconventional metal at high temperatures towards a fermi - liquid at low temperatures @xcite . only in the temperature range above",
    "t@xmath29 the magnetic excitations should exhibit the related @xmath107-scaling .",
    "our data clearly shows that such scaling can be fitted to the data only for the three higher temperatures studied .",
    "the description with the scaling concept seems to be slightly better for the exponent @xmath20=0.75 .",
    "the temperature dependent data suggests a crossover near 30k .",
    "this cross - over agrees very well to that seen in electronic transport properties , where well defined fermi - liquid behavior is only observed below about 25k @xcite .      as emphasized by joynt and rice @xcite ,",
    "the wave - vector- and energy - dependent spin susceptibility in superconductors reflects directly the vector structure of the superconducting ( sc ) gap function , allowing a complete identification of the sc order parameter symmetry .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments have the potential , in principle , to determine the superconducting order parameter . in high-@xmath113 superconductors ,",
    "the spin - singlet @xmath114-wave symmetry sc gap induces a striking modification of the spin susceptibility in the superconducting state . as a consequence",
    ", the so - called `` magnetic resonance peak '' has been observed in the superconducting state of various copper oxide superconductors by ins@xcite .",
    "therefore , a similar experiment in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1would certainly be instructive about the sc gap symmetry .",
    "the enhanced spin susceptibility has been calculated in @xcite , considering a spin - triplet p - wave superconductiviting state with * d*(*k*)=*z*(@xmath115 ) .",
    "note that in such a case , the superconducting gap is isotropic due to the particular shape of the fermi - surface in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "for the wavevector @xmath54 , kee et al .",
    "@xcite and morr et al .",
    "@xcite predicted that below @xmath113 spectral weight is shifted from below twice the superconducting gap , @xmath116 , into a resonance like feature close to 2@xmath116 .",
    "morr et al .",
    "find the resonance in the @xmath117-channel yielding an enhancement of the magnetic excitation intensity by a factor of 9 in the superconducting state as compared to the normal state@xcite .",
    "the difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane susceptibility in the superconducting state arrises from the coherence - factor .",
    "similar theoretical framework is currently used to describe the spin excitation spectrum in spin - singlet htsc cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "theoretical works show that the opening of a d - wave order gap together with the exchange interaction lead to the appearence of a similar resonant feature below 2@xmath116 at the antiferronagnetic wavevector",
    ". these theories successfully account for the observation by ins of the magnetic resonance peak in the superconducting state .    using unpolarized ins ,",
    "one measures the superposition of the out - of - plane and in - plane components of the susceptibility ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : insanisotropy ] ) and both components are equally weighted , when performing the measurements @xmath118=0 .",
    "thus , the predicted resonance feature should be observable , at the value of @xmath1192@xmath116 , if one obtains an experimental arrangement which allows to study the inelastic magnetic signal in this energy range .",
    "due to the almost linear decrease of @xmath120 towards low energies , see fig .",
    "7 , and due to the higher required resolution which implies less neutron flux , these experiments are extremely time demanding . we have analyzed the magnetic excitations in the superconducting phase on the cold triple axis spectrometer in14 at the ill using a two crystal assembly , the results are shown in fig .  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows a scan across the incommensurate peak at @xmath53= 4 mev , i.e. the range already studied with thermal neutrons .",
    "this signal can be determined with little beam time . performing the same scan at 1.6 and 0.8",
    "mev requires considerably more time but still exhibits a well defined signal which seems not to experience any change in the superconducting state at t=0.35 k. the results of constant-@xmath28-scans at @xmath28=(0.7,0.3,0 )   are shown in the left part of fig .",
    "as there is no visible difference between the results obtained at 0.35 and 0.80 k ( both in the sc state ) , we have added the two scans below @xmath121 in the lower left part of fig .",
    "importantly and despite efforts to get rather high statistics , there is no change visible in the energy spectra above and below the superconducting transition in the energy range of the superconducting gap .",
    "the spin susceptibility is not modified appreciably across the superconducting transition ; our data even do not show any opening of a gap .",
    "one can describe the energy dependence presented in fig . 9 with the single relaxor using the same fitted parameters as the low temperature data in fig .",
    "[ fig5].a .",
    "however , the detailled shape of the spin suceptibility ( fig .  [ fig9 ] ) does not exactly match such a simple linear behavior but rather seems to indicate some anomaly near 2mev which requires further experimental work .",
    "there is actually little known about the value of the superconducting gap in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  .",
    "laube et al .",
    "@xcite have reported an andreev reflection study where the opening of the gap is clearly visible in an astonishingly large energy range .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the spectra is quite involved ; assuming a p - wave order parameter laube et al .",
    "obtain 2@xmath116=2.2 mev which may be compared to the value expected within bcs - theory @xmath122= 3.55 k@xmath123@xmath113 = 4.97 k = 0.43 mev .",
    "our data shows that there is no change in the excitation spectrum for energies well below the reported value of 2@xmath116 , but it has not been possible to investigate the lowest energies due to the strong elastic incoherent signal . with further increased resolution ( @xmath124@xmath125 )",
    "we have scanned the energy range 0.30.7 mev at 0.80 k again without evidence for a resonant feature .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of two scans at constant @xmath28=(1,0,0 ) did not yield any difference below and above @xmath121 meaning no ferromagnetic spin susceptibility enhancement .    the theory presented by morr et al .",
    "@xcite should be considered as being quite reliable in the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , since the rpa approach to the magnetic excitations is so successful in the normal state , and since sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   exhibits well defined fermi - liquid properties at temperatures below 25  k. therefore , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] gives strong evidence against a simple p - wave order parameter in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   with a maximum value of the gap of the order of the reported value @xcite .",
    "however , in the meanwhile there are several indications that the order parameter is more complex .",
    "the recent specific heat data on the highest quality single crystals @xcite points to the existence of line nodes in the gap function which were then shown to be aligned parallel to the a , b - plane ( horizontal line nodes ) .",
    "such line nodes were explained by zhitomirsky and rice through a proximity effect between the active @xmath19-band   and the more passive one - dimensional bands @xcite .",
    "a modulation of the gap function along the c - direction will wipe out the resonance predicted for the non - modulated p - wave gap , since for the @xmath28-position analyzed , ( 0.7 0.3 0 ) , the electron hole excitation involves parts of the fermi surface which are fully , partially or not gapped at all . in this sense",
    "the absence of any temperature dependence in the magnetic excitation spectrum is consistent with the presently most accepted shape of the gap function . further theoretical as well as",
    "experimental studies are required to clarify the possibility of a resonant feature at other positions in @xmath126-space .",
    "using assemblies of several crystals of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   we have analyzed the magnetic excitations by ins .",
    "the incommensurate signal arising from the nesting between the one - dimensional bands shows an asymmetry which is well explained by the full rpa analysis as a contribution mainly from the @xmath19-band .",
    "the energy dependence of the incommensurate signal varies with temperature and exhibits a general softening of the spectrum upon cooling .",
    "this behavior indicates that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   is approaching the corresponding sdw instability at low temperature even though this compound is not at a quantum critical composition .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the generalized susceptibility exhibits some @xmath4-scaling only above @xmath11930  k , i.e. in the temperature range where also the transport properties indicate non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "the analysis of magnetic excitations besides the nesting ones shows only minor contributions .",
    "there is some evidence for additional magnetic scattering closer to the zone - center but still not peaking at the zone - center .",
    "this interpretation gets support from the fact that similar scattering is observed in nearly ferromagnetic ca@xmath12sr@xmath13ruo@xmath1   and from various rpa calculations which find excitations mainly related to the @xmath19-band   in this @xmath38-range .    the magnetic excitations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "may be compared to the distinct types of magnetic order which have been induced by substitution .",
    "the dominant excitations reflect the sdw reported to occur in sr@xmath0ru@xmath76ti@xmath77o@xmath1   at small ti concentrations .",
    "the less strong excitations situated more closely to the zone - center and most likely related to the @xmath19-band   become enhanced through ca - substitution which drives the system towards ferromagnetism , but only for rather high ca - concentration .",
    "upon cooling through the superconducting transition we do not observe any change in the magnetic excitation spectra , which - combined with recent calculations @xcite- indicates that the order - parameter in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1   does not possess simple p - wave symmetry .",
