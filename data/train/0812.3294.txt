    "one of the goals in fundamental physics is to search for the detail information of the nucleon structure .",
    "the parton model , suggested by feynman  @xcite , and then immediately applied to the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering process by bjorken  @xcite , proposes that the nucleon is composed of a number of point - like constituents , named `` partons '' , which were afterward recognized as quarks and gluons . in the impulse approximation",
    ", the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering can be viewed as a sum of elastic lepton - parton scattering , in which the incident lepton is scattered off a parton instantaneously and incoherently .",
    "this is in accord with one property of qcd ",
    "asymptotic freedom . on the other hand , due to another property of qcd  color - confinement ,",
    "the constituents of nucleon  quarks and gluons , have never been seen individually .",
    "the nucleon structure functions , in terms of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , are badly desired in hadronic study . however , due to the complicated non - perturbative effect , we still have difficulty to calculate them absolutely from the first principal theory of qcd at present .",
    "various models according to the spirit of qcd have been brought forward , therein statistical ones , providing intuitive appeal and physical simplicity , have made amazing success  @xcite . actually ,",
    "as can be speculated , with partons bound in the wee volume of the nucleon , not only the dynamic , but also the statistical properties , for example , the pauli exclusion principle , should have important effect on the pdfs .",
    "cleymans and thews  @xcite , as pioneers , started with the transition rate of scattering in the framework of temperature dependent field theory and explored a statistical way to generate compatible pdfs .",
    "mac and ugaz  @xcite incorporated first order qcd corrections ( however , the perturbative term turned out to be a sizable fraction of the statistical term ) , and afterwards bhalerao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced finite - size correction and got more fitting results ; they both referred to the infinite - momentum frame ( imf ) .",
    "bickerstaff and londergan  @xcite interpreted the finite - temperature property as to mimic some of the volume - dependent effects due to confinement , furthermore , they discussed the theoretical validity of the ideal gas assumption in detail .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a thermodynamical bag model which evolves as a function of @xmath0 , and the structure functions they got are practicable for @xmath1 and have correct asymptotic behavior as @xmath2 ; in addition , they parametrized on @xmath3 and exhibited the scaling behavior .",
    "bourrely , soffer and buccella  @xcite developed a new form of statistical parametrization , allowing @xmath0-dependent chemical potential , and by incorporating qcd evolution they got indeed remarkable pdfs .",
    "otherwise , zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite constructed a model using the principle of detailed balance and balance without any free parameter , and the gottfried sum they got is in surprisingly agreement with experiments .",
    "alberg and henley  @xcite tracked the detailed balance model for a hadron composed of quark and gluon fock states and obtained parton distributions for the proton as well as the pion .",
    "when dealing with physics in high energy region , light - front dynamics is a suitable language  @xcite .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the impulse approximation fails when using instant - form dynamics in the nucleon rest frame , but works well when using it in the imf or using light - front dynamics in an ordinary frame .",
    "however , statistics in light - front formalism encounters some difficulties , therein the most fatal one is the unclarity about what the light - front temperature is and how it relates with the usual one in instant - form formalism ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "consequently , the way of generalization from instant - form statistics to light - front statistics is quite speculative . actually , even the generalization of the thermal dynamics and statistical theory from the system rest frame to a moving frame in instant - form formalism is also not so understood , and discussion on it has continued for a long period ( for theoretical discussion , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and for recent numerical experiments , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to avoid these tough problems , we start with instant - form statistical expressions in the nucleon rest frame",
    ", then perform transformation on them in terms of light - front kinematic variables .",
    "the analytic expressions of the pdfs we get are something different from those attained in other statistical models performing in the imf  @xcite .",
    "the largest distinction is that , when @xmath4 , the distributions of our light - flavored quarks ( anti - quarks ) do not tend to zero as theirs , but give a rise instead , which agrees with the experimental data better .",
    "worthy to note that , our intention is only to illustrate whether the statistical effect is important and to which aspects of the nucleon structure it is important , not how well it matches the experimental results , so we do not make any effort to fit the experimental data intentionally .",
    "there is no arbitrary parameter put by hand in our model , and all parameters are basic statistical quantities .",
    "some of other statistical models can fit the experimental data better by introducing many free parameters , however , it weakens the stringency at a cost .",
    "in addition , our results naturally cover the whole @xmath0 region [ 0,1 ] , and the features of pdfs and structure functions at the boundary are of great interest in both theoretical and experimental study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief description about the approach used in this paper is introduced , and the analytic expressions of the pdfs are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical results and comparisons with experiments and other theories are illustrated . in section 4 ,",
    "the mass effect of the partons and the features of heavy - flavored pdfs are discussed .",
    "the last section is a short summary .",
