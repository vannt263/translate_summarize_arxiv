    "exclusive non - leptonic decays play a crucial part in the on - going programme to clarify the sources of cp violation and rare flavour - changing phenomena .",
    "as regards cp violation this is illustrated by the fact that there exists a fair knowledge of the length of each of the sides of the unitarity triangle from semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays and @xmath1 mixing . since recently",
    ", the angle @xmath2 ( more precisely , @xmath3 ) is determined fairly accurately by the time - dependent cp asymmetry in the non - leptonic decay @xmath4 and related ones .",
    "however , the direct measurement of the other angle @xmath5 , the phase of @xmath6 in the standard phase convention , remains a challenge to theory and experiment .",
    "although @xmath5 is determined indirectly through the other measurements , the complementary direct determination is important , since meson mixing and rare non - leptonic decays could be affected by new flavour - changing interactions .    the angle @xmath5 can be determined from decays with some kind of interference of @xmath7 ( no phase ) and @xmath8 ( phase @xmath5 ) tree transitions and their conjugates ( @xmath9 ) or from decays with interference of @xmath10 ( tree , phase @xmath5 ) and @xmath11 ( penguin , phase 0 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) ) .",
    "there exist a few methods that allow one to obtain @xmath5 in a theoretically clean way , which means that no calculation of strong interaction effects is needed , but these methods are all difficult to realize experimentally at present .",
    "the more general situation is that some information on the decay amplitudes is required to extract @xmath5 from the interference term in branching fractions or cp asymmetries . in technical terms",
    "one needs to compute the matrix elements @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an operator in the weak effective hamiltonian and @xmath16 is a particular exclusive final state .",
    "the qcd factorization approach @xcite uses heavy quark expansion methods ( @xmath17 ) and soft - collinear factorization ( particle energies @xmath18 , `` colour - transparency '' ) to compute the matrix elements @xmath14 in an expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "only the leading term in @xmath19 assumes a simple form .",

    "_ factorization does not and is not expected to hold at subleading order .",
    "attempts to compute subleading power corrections to hard spectator - scattering in perturbation theory usually result in infrared divergences , which signal the breakdown of factorization .",
    "a subset of power corrections has been parametrized or estimated in @xcite .",
    "it is common practice in applications of perturbative qcd to not include errors from power corrections .",
    "one would wish to do better here , first because non - leptonic decays test fundamental aspects of weak interactions , second because some power corrections related to scalar currents are enhanced by factors such as @xmath32 @xcite . at least these effects should be estimated and included into the error budget .",
    "this has been attempted in @xcite .",
    "all weak annihilation contributions belong to this class of effects .",
    "qcd - improved factorization has been applied to date to the following final states :    * @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes a light pseudo - scalar non - singlet meson @xcite .",

    "the `` pqcd '' approach _ @xcite . in this approach",
    "the decay amplitude is calculated in the brodsky - lepage formalism .",
    "the main difference with the qcd - improved factorization approach arises through the stronger assumption that sudakov suppression renders the @xmath28 form factor and many power - suppressed effects ( such as weak annihilation ) calculable .",
    "the advocates of the qcd factorization approach do not agree with the proponents of the pqcd approach on conceptual aspects of the implementation of sudakov suppression and on the claim that the result is perturbative and accurate @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the phenomenology of these decays is discussed in @xcite .",
    "qcd - improved factorization explains the experimentally well - established fact that the colour - allowed class - i decays to @xmath53 are controlled by an approximately universal coefficient @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "factorization is not expected to hold for colour - suppressed class - ii decays to @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding coefficient @xmath56 is therefore depends on the final state .",

    "if the @xmath57 meson is considered as heavy ( @xmath58 fixed , @xmath51 ) , @xmath59 is power - suppressed in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the power suppression is due to @xmath60 but with @xmath61 this suppression is only formal .",
    "if the @xmath57 meson is considered as light ( @xmath62 fixed , @xmath51 ) , @xmath59 counts as order 1 and becomes calculable .",
    "( a crude estimate has been given in @xcite . ) in this case one expects an important non - universal contribution from spectator - scattering . in both cases",
    "@xmath59 should be smaller than 1 due to colour factors .",
    "the measurement of @xmath63 allows one for the first time to construct the complete isospin triangle for @xmath64 decays and hence to determine the magnitude and rescattering phase of @xmath59 , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the result is that @xmath65 is sizeable for @xmath66 final states .",
    "together with @xmath67 for @xmath68 final states this provides clear evidence for the non - universality of colour - suppressed decays , but it is difficult to interpret this result quantitatively since the theory is not expected to be accurate for @xmath69 and @xmath68 final states . for further discussion of this result from the perspective of qcd factorization see @xcite .      the possibility to determine the cp - violating angle @xmath5 by comparing the calculation of branching fractions into @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "final states with the corresponding data has been investigated in detail @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the branching fractions for the modes @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which depend only on a single weak phase to very good approximation , are well described by the theory .",
    "this demonstrates that the magnitude of the tree and penguin amplitude is obtained correctly , where for the penguin amplitude the 1-loop radiative correction is important to reach this conclusion .",
    "there is , however , a relatively large normalization uncertainty for the @xmath72 final states , which are sensitive to weak annihilation and the strange quark mass through the scalar penguin amplitude .",
    "this uncertainty can be partially eliminated by taking ratios of branching fractions .",
    "the agreement is less good for branching fractions with significant interference of tree and penguin amplitudes , if @xmath5 is assumed to take values around @xmath75 as favoured by indirect constraints .",
    "this may indicate an interesting alternative determination of @xmath5 , but the cp - averaged branching fractions sensitive to @xmath5 also depend on the strong phase difference of the two interfering amplitudes .",
    "this dependence is suppressed as long as the phase difference is small since only its cosine enters the calculation . with some exceptions ( such as the final state @xmath76 )",
    "qcd - improved factorization predicts that strong phase differences are not large , since they are parametrically of order @xmath20 or @xmath77 , and it therefore also predicts small direct cp asymmetries , up to @xmath78 ( with a preference around @xmath79 ) for the @xmath80 , @xmath81 final states .",
    "the current data seem to favour small cp asymmetries , but they are not yet accurate enough to decide upon whether the qcd factorization approach allows one to predict strong phases quantitatively .",
    "the current interpretation of charmless non - leptonic @xmath0 decays can be summarized by a global fit of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 to the six cp averaged @xmath71 , @xmath72 branching fractions shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the result is consistent with the standard fit based on meson mixing and @xmath31 , but shows a preference for larger @xmath5 or smaller @xmath31 .",
    "if the estimate of the theory uncertainty ( included in the curves in the figure ) is correct , non - leptonic decays together with @xmath31 from semi - leptonic decays already imply the existence of a cp - violating phase of @xmath84 at the 2 - 3 @xmath85 level .",
    "the angle @xmath88 ( or @xmath5 , given the @xmath1 mixing phase ) , can be determined from the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath89 decay alone , if the relative magnitude of the penguin amplitude , @xmath90 , can be computed .",

    "the direct cp asymmetry is proportional to the sine of the strong phase of @xmath90 and can be used as a phenomenological check of the computation of @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays how a measurement of @xmath95 constrains @xmath96 , when @xmath90 is computed in the qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "the figure illustrates that even if theoretical ( or experimental ) uncertainties prevent an accurate determination of @xmath86 in this way , the inaccurate result on @xmath97 still translates into a useful constraint in the @xmath96 plane .",
    "this reflects the fact that other observables do not currently constrain @xmath86 very well .",
    "interpreting the new data on exclusive two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons in terms of fundamental parameters of the standard model requires  at least for the present  control over strong interaction effects .",
    "qcd - improved factorization allows us to formulate and discuss the problem systematically in the expansion parameters @xmath20 and @xmath77 .",
    "the first comparisons of the theory with data on heavy - light and charmless final states are encouraging , but the theory may not always be accurate or useful . more data and calculations should help understanding where the theory works or fails , and if it fails , why it does . so far no unexpected failures are observed .",
    "if the estimates of theoretical uncertainties are correct , @xmath98 together with @xmath31 from semi - leptonic decay establishes @xmath99 at the 2 - 3@xmath100 level .",

    "in this appendix i address a subtle point in the parameterization of infrared sensitive twist-3 corrections to non - leptonic decays .",
    "the point concerns the legitimacy of integrating by parts in convolution integrals with apparently divergent boundary terms . depending on the procedure the result appears to be either a linear or a logarithmic infrared divergence .",
    "the difference is crucial , since a linear divergence compensates the @xmath19-suppression and hence spoils factorization even in the heavy quark limit , while a logarithmic divergence does not .",
    "the results of the following discussion have been used but have not been explained in our previous work @xcite .    in order to dispose of the need to introduce @xmath0 meson distribution amplitudes i consider an analogous problem that appears in the calculation of the pion form factor @xmath101 at large momentum transfer @xmath102 . the light - cone expansion in @xmath103",

    "this does not seem to be justified , however , since the boundary terms are non - zero , in fact infinite , when the asymptotic distribution amplitudes @xmath117 , @xmath118 are inserted . not performing the integration by parts",
    ", it is seen that the result from p1 is linearly divergent as @xmath119 , while the result from p2 exhibits only a logarithmic divergence . since non - perturbative infrared effects regulate the divergence at @xmath120 ( when the quark momentum becomes of order @xmath121 )",
    ", the p1-result is of order @xmath122 , parametrically larger than the p2-result which is only of order @xmath123 .",

    "the main effect of this is to replace @xmath125 by @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",

    "the numerator is @xmath131 , which is always correct , but the denominator zero arises from the virtuality of a quark propagator , which approaches zero and which is not regularized by introducing a gluon mass . to make the calculation well - defined all small - virtuality regions must be properly regularized .",
    "one possibility is to assign a small mass to the quarks as well .",
    "denoting the corresponding parameter by @xmath132 , this leads to the boundary term @xmath133 it is not difficult to see that in this particular case the amplitude has a finite limit for @xmath134 ( but @xmath135 still non - zero ) after the convolution integrals are performed .",
    "the only effect of the complete regularization is therefore to make all integrations by parts well - defined and to eliminate the spurious linearly divergent boundary term .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the correct result is @xmath136 which exhibits a double logarithmic divergence , one from each convolution integral .",
    "this coincides with the result for the chirally - enhanced twist-4 corrections obtained long ago by geshkenbein and terentev @xcite .",
    "the discussion can be analogously repeated for non - leptonic @xmath0 meson decays , where the problem appears in the computation of @xmath19-suppressed terms .",
    "the conclusion is again that integration by parts is allowed and that the correct result is obtained directly with the projector p2 . on the other hand",
    "using p1 requires one to regularize carefully all propagators that can go close to mass - shell near the endpoints of the integration region .",
    "there is a deeper reason why the infrared divergence in the twist-4 correction to the pion form factor should not be power - like .",
    "there exist two basic scattering mechanisms that contribute to the form factor .",
    "one is the hard scattering mechanism , in which all components of a given fock state of the pion participate in a hard interaction .",
    "the other is a soft - overlap contribution , in which case a number of fock components with small longitudinal momentum fraction does not participate in a hard interaction . a complete asymptotic expansion of the form factor should combine both mechanisms consistently . recent work on the analogous problem for the @xmath137 form factor @xcite together with the structure of the radiatively corrected qcd sum rule for the @xmath138 form factor",
    "@xcite suggests the following factorization formula that incorporates the hard scattering and soft - overlap contribution : @xmath139 here @xmath140 and @xmath141 represent twist-2 and twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes and @xmath142 a soft - overlap form factor which scales as @xmath143 and which can be defined in an effective theory in which all hard scatterings are integrated out .",
    "@xmath144 denotes the hard - scattering kernel at the twist-4 level discussed above except that the endpoint divergence is factorized into the soft - overlap form factor , such that both terms depend on a factorization parameter @xmath145 .",
    "if this ( conjectured ) factorization formula is to be correct , the endpoint contribution of the twist-4 term can be at most logarithmically enhanced .",
