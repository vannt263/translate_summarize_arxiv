    "the standard way to remove the gauge - dependence of nonlocal correlators in gauge theories , like qcd , is to include path - ordered exponential factors of the gauge field that are absent in the original lagrangian of a local quantum field theory .",
    "these operators are in general contour - dependent and give rise to new divergences , called in modern jargon rapidity divergences , that are not related to the standard singularities  ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir )  that appear in feynman diagrams .",
    "they originate from contour irregularities caused by topological obstructions  endpoints , cusps , self - crossings  of the gauge contours entering the exponents of the gauge links and affect the renormalization properties of the qcd correlators @xcite .",
    "the trouble is , such divergences have to be regularized and there is great ambiguity in adopting an appropriate subtraction procedure within a valid factorization scheme .",
    "moreover , the use of the lightcone gauge quantization depends crucially on the adopted boundary conditions imposed on the gluon propagator in order to treat the gauge links at infinity .",
    "these issues will be considered here in some detail . in sec .",
    "[ eq : mesonic - correlator ] , we will address the one - loop virtual corrections of the quark propagator in a general covariant gauge within two different gauge - invariant schemes : the mandelstam formalism @xcite and the @xmath2-field algorithm @xcite .",

    "contour obstructions give rise to rapidity divergences and hence contribute to the anomalous dimension of the correlator . for our considerations in this section",
    ", we assume that the contour is smooth . because only the two endpoints entail rapidity divergences , it is sufficient to employ the straight line @xmath11 joining @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is that other features of smooth contours , e.g. , their length , do not affect the renormalization properties of the twist - two mesonic correlator and hence @xmath11 can be used as a subtraction contour for its renormalization for all members of the universality class of smooth contours .",
    "differences in the definition of the mesonic correlator for different smooth contours show up at the next higher twist level @xcite .",

    "an immediate important conclusion is that in the special gauge @xmath1 all contour- ( or @xmath2-field- ) related divergences cancel among themselves so that the residual renormalization effects can be absorbed into @xmath69 , while the ward identity @xmath70 is preserved like in qed .",
    "it is expected that going to the next higher loop , one will obtain a similar result but for @xmath71 as found in @xcite in the context of multiloop contributions to the nonsinglet qcd evolution equations .",
    "another issue raised by collins in @xcite is whether the definition of @xmath81 contains uncanceled divergences originating from the self - energy of the gauge links .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that all uv divergences from the @xmath90 momentum integrations can be regularized dimensionally and give @xmath91 poles , while collinear poles are controlled by the quark virtuality @xmath92 , and ir singularities are regularized by an auxiliary gluon mass @xmath93 that drops out at the end .",
    "on the other hand , overlapping divergences have , in general , to be cured by a subtraction procedure encoded in the soft renormalization factor @xmath78 and appear in @xmath94 in terms of an auxiliary mass @xmath95 . in the @xmath0 gauge all diagrams with gluon attachments to the gauge links ( longitudinal or transverse ) either vanish identically or cancel partly against contributions from cross - talk diagrams with gluon attachments between the quark line and a gauge link .",
    "for the adv , ret , and pv pole prescriptions , all remaining divergences are taken care of by the soft factor rendering @xmath96 regular . employing the ml prescription ,",
    "one gets a result that is reminiscent of that obtained in the special covariant gauge @xmath1 in which all rapidity divergences emerging from the endpoints of smooth contours cancel among themselves . at higher loops ,",
    "the gauge @xmath1 will receive @xmath97 corrections with coefficients that can be determined by demanding the validity of the qed - like ward identity @xmath70 .",
    "we have shown the multiplicative renormalization of the gauge - invariant mesonic vacuum correlator in the _ nonlocal _ mandelstam approach for smooth contours and found that to @xmath15 it is equivalent to the result obtained in the _ local _ @xmath2-field effective formalism . at one loop ,",
    "all contour- ( or @xmath2-field ) related rapidity divergences cancel among themselves using the special gauge @xmath1 .",
    "we argued that a proper definition of the quark tmd pdf must account for the appropriate subtraction of a rapidity divergence that overlaps with the usual uv singularities and can not be regularized dimensionally . employing the lightcone gauge with @xmath84-independent pole prescriptions ,",
    "this can be achieved via a soft renormalization factor @xcite .",
    "the imposition of the @xmath84-dependent mandelstam  leibbrandt prescription removes all rapidity divergences and reproduces at one loop the results of the special covariant gauge @xmath1 with the soft factor reducing to unity .",
