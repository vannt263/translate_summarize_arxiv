    "we are concerned with the problem of detecting a deterministic signal with unknown spatial extent against a noisy background .",
    "this problem arises in a wide range of applications , e.g. in epidemiology and astronomy , and has received considerable attention recently due to important problems in e.g. biosurveillance . the standard statistical tool to address this problem is the scan statistic ( maximum likelihood ratio statistic ) , which considers the maximum of local likelihood ratio statistics on certain subsets of the data .",
    "there is a large body of work on scan statistics , see e.g. the references in glaz and balakrishnan  ( 1999 ) , glaz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and glaz et al .",
    "but there is also empirical evidence that the scan statistic is suboptimal , see e.g. neill  ( 2009 ) or chan  ( 2009 ) .",
    "siegmund  ( 2001 ) and gangnon and clayton  ( 2001 ) propose to use the average of the likelihood ratio statistics instead of their maximum . in different contexts , various versions of the average likelihood ratio where considered by shiryaev  ( 1963 ) , burnashev and begmatov  ( 1990 ) , and dmbgen  ( 1998 ) .",
    "chan  ( 2009 ) and chan and zhang  ( 2009 ) perform simulation studies for various detection problems which suggest that the average likelihood ratio statistic is superior to the scan statistic . in light of these results",
    ", it is of interest to provide a theoretical investigation of the performance of both the scan and the average likelihood ratio .",
    "such a theoretical comparison seems to be missing in the literature and appears to be quite relevant given the widespread use of the scan statistic as a standard tool for a range of detection problems .",
    "in the first part of this paper we perform such an investigation in the prototypical univariate sampled data model with white gaussian noise and we obtain the following results :    the scan statistic possesses optimal detection power only for signals with the smallest spatial extent .",
    "otherwise the scan statistic is suboptimal , and the loss of power can be considerable for signals having a large spatial extent . in the case of the average likelihood ratio ( alr )",
    "statistic , these conclusions hold in reversed order : the alr possesses optimal detection power for signals having large spatial extent , but is suboptimal for signals with small spatial extent",
    ". however , the loss of power in the latter case is so small that it is unlikely to be of concern , at least for most sample sizes considered today .    in the second part of the paper we propose a modification of the alr that results in universal optimality and allows efficient computation .",
    "the alr averages the likelihood ratios pertaining to @xmath2 stretches of the data , where @xmath3 is the sample size , resulting in an @xmath4 algorithm .",
    "thus the use of the alr is computationally infeasible even for moderate sample sizes .",
    "we introduce a condensed alr that averages only a certain subset of the likelihood ratios and we show that this condensed alr possesses optimal detection power for signals having arbitrary spatial extent .",
    "furthermore , this condensed alr can be computed in almost linear time , viz . with an @xmath5 algorithm . in light of the preceding discussion , it is arguably this improvement in computation time rather than the small gain in detection power that is the main advantage of this modification .",
    "we note that typically , an approximation introduced to make a procedure computationally less intensive will on the flip side degrade its performance somewhat .",
    "it is thus noteworthy that in the case of the alr , our computationally efficient modification will actually lead to an improved ( in fact : optimal ) performance .",
    "we give sharp theoretical results on the performance of the alr , the scan statistic , and the newly proposed alr in sections  [ theory ] and  [ modify ] .",
    "since these results are asymptotic , we complement them in section  [ sims ] with a simulation study that illustrates the results .",
    "various modifications to the scan have been proposed in the literature in order to improve its detection power .",
    "we include two such modifications in our simulation study to obtain a more informative comparison with the alr .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] and defer proofs to section  [ proofs ] .",
    "we observe @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are i.i.d . @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 .",
    "both the amplitude @xmath12 and the support @xmath13 are unknown .",
    "the task is to decide whether a signal is present , i.e. whether @xmath14",
    ".    the above sampled data model with gaussian white noise serves as a prototype for many important applications .",
    "the heuristics and results we develop below suggest that our conclusions will carry over , at least qualitatively , to related detection problems involving multivariate signals , non - gaussian errors , or the detection of clusters in models involving densities or intensities as described in kulldorff  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic for testing @xmath15 when @xmath13 is known is computed as @xmath16    since @xmath13 is unknown , the standard approach is to scan over all intervals @xmath17 , 0\\leq j",
    "< k\\leq n\\}$ ] for the largest likelihood ratio statistic .",
    "the resulting _ scan statistic _ ( maximum likelihood ratio statistic ) is equivalently given by @xmath18\\br)\\br|.\\ ] ] in contrast , the _ average likelihood ratio statistic _ ( alr ) averages the likelihood ratios over all intervals @xmath19 : @xmath20))^2}{2}\\br).\\ ] ]    to quantify the performance of these statistics , we look for the smallest value of @xmath21 that allows a reliable detection of the signal .",
    "it will be explained below that in order to achieve optimality , a test must be able to asymptotically detect signals @xmath22 with [ optcondition ] |_n|  ,   b_n .",
    "note that for signals @xmath22 on _ small scales _ , i.e. with @xmath23 , ( [ optcondition ] ) is equivalent to [ optsmall ]    @xmath24 .    for signals @xmath22 on _ large scales _",
    ", i.e. with @xmath25 ' is replaced by ` @xmath26 ' in ( [ optsmall ] ) , then there exists no test that can detect such @xmath22 with nontrivial asymptotic power .",
    "likewise , a contiguity argument as in dmbgen and walther  ( 2008 ) shows that in the case of large scales the condition ( [ optlarge ] ) is necessary for any test to be consistent against @xmath22 . on the other hand , we will exhibit below a test that will detect with asymptotic power 1 signals satisfying ( [ optcondition ] ) .",
    "thus the detection threshold given by ( [ optcondition ] ) marks a standard that is attainable but can not be improved upon .",
    "we will now examine how the scan and the alr compare against this standard .",
    "[ scan ] let @xmath27 be the @xmath28 quantile of the null distribution of @xmath29 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath30 with @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath33 with @xmath34 as above , then @xmath35 .",
    "thus the detection threshold for the scan is @xmath36 , irrespective of the spatial extent of the signal . comparing to ( [ optsmall ] ) , one sees that the scan is optimal only for signals having the smallest spatial extent , i.e. for @xmath37 close to @xmath38 . as an illustration , if @xmath39 , @xmath40 $ ] , then detection is possible only if @xmath41 is at least @xmath42 times larger than the optimal threshold . in the case of large scales ,",
    "comparison with ( [ optlarge ] ) shows that this multiplier diverges to infinity , and thus the scan suffers from a noticeably inferior performance .",
    "these results are illustrated in the simulation study in section  [ sims ] and explain the sometimes disappointing performance of the scan observed in the literature .",
    "we note that an alternative way to analyze the performance of the scan is to put a prior on the unknown spatial extent of the signal , e.g. the uniform distribution on @xmath43 .",
    "it is readily seen that this analysis leads to the same conclusions as the case of large scales above , i.e. the scan is far from optimal .",
    "the next theorem details the performance of the average likelihood ratio :    [ alr ] let @xmath44 be the @xmath28 quantile of the null distribution of @xmath45 .    1 .",
    "@xmath45 is optimal for detecting signals with large spatial extent : + if @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 , then @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath45 is not optimal for detecting signals with small spatial extent : + if @xmath23 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 , then @xmath52 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath53 above , where @xmath24 , then @xmath49 .",
    "comparing with ( [ optsmall ] ) one see that on small scales the alr requires @xmath41 to be about @xmath54 times larger than the optimal threshold .",
    "this discrepancy is not very consequential : the simulations in section  [ sims ] show that the corresponding loss of power is quite small for sample sizes up to @xmath55 , which is the largest sample size we were able to simulate due to the @xmath4 computational complexity of the alr .",
    "a heuristic explanation of why the scan and the alr do not obtain optimality is as follows : there are @xmath3 disjoint intervals @xmath56 of length @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding likelihood ratio statistics @xmath58 are i.i.d .",
    "n(0,1 ) under the null hypothesis , thus their maximum behaves like @xmath59 .",
    "but in the case of large intervals of length @xmath60 ( say ) , there are only @xmath61 disjoint intervals that result in independent statistics @xmath58 .",
    "the statistics for the other intervals of length @xmath60 are dependent with these @xmath58 since the intervals overlap .",
    "thus the null distribution of that maximum behaves roughly like the maximum of @xmath61 i.i.d .",
    "n(0,1 ) , which is @xmath62 . hence the overall maximum @xmath29 is dominated by the small intervals , with a corresponding loss of power at large intervals .    as for the alr ,",
    "if a detectable signal lives on a large interval @xmath13 , then @xmath58 will be significant provided @xmath56 has a nonvanishing overlap with @xmath13 . since there are @xmath2 such intervals , the alr will be significant despite the divisor @xmath63 in its definition . in the case of small intervals",
    "@xmath13 , however , the number of intervals @xmath56 that yield a sufficiently large statistic @xmath58 is so small compared to the total number of intervals ( @xmath2 ) that their contribution to @xmath45 is annihilated by the divisor @xmath63 .",
    "more precisely : the likelihood ratio statistic is maximized at @xmath64 , where its size is @xmath65 ( up to log terms ) for signals at the detection threshold ( [ optcondition ] ) .",
    "thus if @xmath66 , then there are only a few significant likelihood ratios and their magnitude is about @xmath67 .",
    "thus dividing by @xmath63 will let their contribution vanish unless the size of the likelihood ratio statistics is increased to @xmath68 by doubling @xmath69 in the log likelihood ratio .",
    "the above heuristic suggests that an optimal version of the alr may be constructed by averaging the likelihood ratios not over all @xmath2 intervals of @xmath70 but over a subset of @xmath70 with cardinality close to @xmath3 .",
    "the general idea of why such an approximation is feasible is as follows : for larger intervals , there is not much lost by considering only intervals with endpoints on a coarser grid as long as the distance between such gridpoints is small compared to the length of the intervals .",
    "then these intervals will still provide a good approximation to @xmath70 , while the cardinality of this approximating set can be reduced dramatically .",
    "to implement this idea , we modify the approach in walther  ( 2010 ) and rufibach and walther  ( 2010 ) and group intervals into @xmath71 sets , each of which contains intervals having about the same length : the approximating set @xmath72 consists of intervals that contain between @xmath73 and @xmath74 design points and whose endpoints are restricted to a grid consisting of every @xmath75th design point , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "our overall approximating set is then the union of these @xmath72 together with all small intervals observations .",
    "but in the current regression setting we can and do also consider optimal detection of signals supported on small intervals containing as little as one design point .",
    "for this reason we include @xmath78 in our approximating set .",
    "] : @xmath79 \\in { \\cal j}_n :   j , k \\in \\{i d_{\\ell } , i=0,1,\\ldots \\}\\ \\mbox { and } m_{\\ell}<k - j\\leq 2m_{\\ell}\\br\\},\\nn \\\\ \\ismall & = \\bl\\{(\\frac{j}{n},\\frac{k}{n}]\\in { \\cal j}_n : k - j \\leq m_{\\ell_{max}}\\br\\}.\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we suppress the dependence on @xmath3 for notational simplicity .",
    "our _ condensed alr _ is thus @xmath80 the above choice of @xmath75 and @xmath81 results in statistical and computational efficiency for the alr and is different from the choices used in walther  ( 2010 ) and rufibach and walther  ( 2010 ) .",
    "we give an explanation for this choice in the proof of theorem  [ alrapprox ] .",
    "[ alrapprox ] the condensed alr @xmath82 is optimal for detecting signals with arbitrary spatial extent , i.e. it has asymptotic power 1 against signals @xmath22 satisfying ( [ optcondition ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath82 can be computed in @xmath83 time .",
    "since the results of the previous two sections are asymptotic , we illustrate the performance of the scan and the alr in a finite sample context with a simulation study . for a more informative comparison",
    ", we also include in our study modifications of the scan aimed at increasing its power that have recently been proposed in the literature .",
    "one such modification is the _ blocked scan _ , see walther  ( 2010 ) .",
    "it defines the @xmath84th block as comprising all intervals that contain between @xmath76 and @xmath74 design points .",
    "then one assigns different critical values to different blocks such that the significance level on the @xmath84th block decreases as @xmath85 .    in more detail , for @xmath81 and @xmath86 as above",
    "define @xmath87\\br)\\br|,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ell=1,\\ldots,\\ell_{max},\\ ] ] and @xmath88)st block comprises all small intervals that contain up to @xmath89 design points .",
    "the blocked scan declares that a signal is present if @xmath90 for any @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath92 is the @xmath93 quantile of the null distribution of @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( say ) , and @xmath96 is chosen such that the overall significance level is @xmath97 : @xmath98 the critical values @xmath99 and @xmath96 can be easily simulated with monte carlo similarly as in rufibach and walther ( 2010 ) .",
    "we suppress the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath3 for notational simplicity .    for the second modification of the scan",
    "we employ the penalty term introduced by dmbgen and spokoiny  ( 2001 ) in the context of inference about a function .",
    "this penalization method can be readily adapted for use with the scan statistic in the gaussian regression setting considered here .",
    "the idea is to subtract off the putative maximum at each scale in order to put the different scales on an equal footing : the _ penalized scan _ is @xmath100\\br)\\br|-\\sqrt{2 \\log \\frac{en}{k - j}}\\br).\\ ] ]    both the penalized scan and the blocked scan aim at improving the power of the scan by fixing the miscalibration across different scales described in section  [ theory ] .",
    "a drawback of the penalized scan is that it requires the specification of the penalty term , which has to be derived for each particular situation at hand .",
    "the form of the penalty term depends on the tail behavior of the local test statistics , their dependence structure , and the entropy of the underlying space .",
    "thus these properties have to be derived on a case - by - case basis and this derivation is typically far from straightforward , while the block method has the advantage that it provides a general recipe that does not require any case - specific input .",
    "computationally efficient algorithms for evaluating the scan or an approximation thereof have been introduced in the literature , see e.g. neill and moore  ( 2004 ) , arias - castro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , rufibach and walther  ( 2010 ) and walther  ( 2010 ) . unlike the case of the condensed alr , where the particular choice of the approximating set leads to optimal power properties",
    ", it appears that evaluating the scan on an appropriate approximating set does not lead to optimal detection by itself .",
    "rather , it appears that optimal detection requires the use of scale - dependent critical values , and efficient computation has to be addressed separately using any of the methods cited above .    in our simulation study",
    "we first consider signals @xmath22 with fixed norm @xmath101 but varying spatial extent . table  [ table1 ] gives the power of the scan , the alr , the condensed alr , the penalized scan , and the blocked scan for a sample size of @xmath55 .",
    "the results are visualized in the left plot in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "one sees that the overall performance of the scan is inferior to that of the other four methods , whose performances are quite similar . in particular , the power of the scan is not increasing with the spatial extent of the signal as opposed to the other four methods . as a consequence , the scan is competitive only for signals on the smallest scales",
    ".     +    table  [ table1 ] also shows an improvement in power of the condensed alr vis - a - vis the alr on small scales , illustrating theorems  [ alr ] and  [ alrapprox ] .",
    "however , this improvement is modest , at least for the sample size under consideration , and thus the main advantage of the condensed scan is arguably the dramatic reduction in computation time to @xmath5 versus @xmath4 for the alr .",
    "we were able to accurately simulate critical values for the condensed alr with a sample size of 1 million in a matter of hours , whereas this computation would take hundreds of days for the alr .",
    "table  [ table2 ] shows how the power varies as function of @xmath102 , see the right plot in figure  [ fig1 ] for a visual representation .",
    "the spatial extent of the signal was chosen uniformly in @xmath103 $ ] in each of the 2000 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the power curves of the last four methods are again quite similar , and superior to that of the scan .",
    "one sees that the scan requires a signal with almost twice the norm to achieve the power of the four other methods .",
    "according to the results in the previous sections , this discrepancy will increase with the sample size .    .",
    "power in percent for detecting signals @xmath22 with fixed norm @xmath104 but varying spatial extent @xmath37 , @xmath55 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all power values in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] are with respect to a 5% significance level .",
    "the corresponding critical values were simulated with 10000 monte carlo samples , and the power was simulated with 2000 monte carlo samples .",
    "the location of the signal was chosen at random in each of these simulations to avoid confounding the results with the approximation scheme of the condensed alr .",
    "the scan is optimal only for detecting signals on the smallest scales .",
    "the alr has a superior overall performance and is optimal for detecting signals on all scales except on the smallest ones , but the loss of power there appears to be modest .",
    "moreover , by averaging the likelihood ratios over a particular subset of intervals rather than over all intervals , the resulting condensed alr is simultaneously optimal for all scales and also allows for efficient computation .",
    "in contrast , improved versions of the scan , such as the penalized scan and the blocked scan , appear to require the use of scale - dependent critical values , and thus it appears that statistical optimality and computational efficiency have to be addressed separately for the scan .",
    "the results of this paper are developed in the gaussian white noise model since it is known that the conceptual results in that model are applicable and relevant for a wide range of related problems .",
    "we note that the concrete implementation of the results derived in the gaussian white noise model requires additional work that depends on the concrete problem at hand .",
    "for example , in the univariate regression setting rohde  ( 2008 ) employs local signed rank tests to transform non - gaussian data into statistics with sub - gaussian tails , and cai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) employ a local median transformation for the same purpose . to see why such an additional step is required , note that the null distribution of both the scan and the alr depends sensitively on the tails of the error distribution , and hence on the assumption of gaussianity .",
    "the above papers show rigorously that the gaussian white noise model is applicable after the local signed rank or the local median transformation , assuming only e.g. symmetry of the error distribution .",
    "these arguments are technically sophisticated and thus the transformation step constitutes a piece of methodological work by itself .",
    "it is thus helpful to separate the conceptual issues involving the scan and the alr from the particular implementation and to present an unencumbered exposition in the gaussian white noise model . in particular ,",
    "the heuristics developed in this model give guidance how the corresponding problems might be addressed in related detection problems , such as the detection of clusters in models involving densities and intensities , as well as the important case of detecting multivariate signals .",

    "an interval @xmath56 will result in a significant likelihood ratio provided its endpoints lie in a @xmath207 neighborhood of the endpoints of @xmath13 , where latexmath:[$\\eps_n : = \\min\\bl(1,b_n(\\log \\frac{e } {    @xmath204 is @xmath209 . under ( [ optcondition ] )",
    "the size of the corresponding likelihood ratios is @xmath210 for arbitrary @xmath211 .",
    "thus optimality of @xmath82 will obtain if the number of significant intervals in @xmath204 is at least @xmath212 for some fixed @xmath211 , and even if the number is smaller by some factor @xmath213 since @xmath214 . solving this inequality for @xmath75 yields @xmath215 .",
    "requiring @xmath216 for some @xmath217 for computational efficiency suggests the choice @xmath218 .",
    "computing @xmath219 shows that this choice of @xmath75 is indeed consistent with @xmath216 provided @xmath220 .",
    "further , it will be seen that @xmath221 under the null hypothesis requires @xmath222 , i.e. @xmath223 .",
    "finally , optimal detection for very small intervals @xmath13 requires that their endpoints are approximated exactly , i.e. it is necessary to have @xmath224 for large @xmath84 .",
    "thus we need an appropriate combination of a small @xmath223 and a large @xmath225 .",
    "since the required large @xmath225 results in a noticeably worse computation time , we prefer to stick to a @xmath226 algorithm by setting @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and by explicitly considering all small intervals containing up to @xmath229 design points in lieu of choosing a larger @xmath225 .",
    "we now prove the theorem , starting with the claim about the computational complexity .",
    "since @xmath204 allows only every @xmath75th design point as a potential endpoint for an interval , there are at most @xmath230 left endpoints . for each left endpoint",
    "there are at most @xmath231 right endpoints since each interval contains not more than @xmath74 design points .",
    "thus @xmath232",
    "@xmath233 can be evaluated in a constant number of steps after an initial one - time computation of the cumulative sum vector of @xmath234 . since that computation has complexity @xmath235 , the overall computational complexity of computing @xmath82",
    "is dominated by the cardinality of @xmath236 and hence is @xmath237 .",
    "next we show that for @xmath238 : [ 3c ] a_n , cond  =  o_p(1 )   n . proceeding as in the proof of ( [ alrnull ] ) it is enough to show that [ 3d ] _",
    "i  =  o(1 ) .",
    "since @xmath239 implies @xmath240 , we obtain with ( [ 3a ] ) and ( [ 3aa ] ) : _ i & & _",

    "( [ 3d ] ) follows .    to establish optimality of @xmath82 we proceed as in the proof of theorem  [ alr ] and consider @xmath22 with arbitrary spatial extent and @xmath242 where @xmath48 .",
    "as before we define @xmath243 and @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "intervals @xmath157 will contribute significant lr statistics to @xmath82 .",
    "since we now require that the endpoints of these intervals fall on a @xmath75- grid , there are now many fewer of these intervals .",
    "but this is more than compensated by the small cardinality of @xmath236 appearing in the divisor of @xmath82 .",
    "this fact allows us to detect @xmath22 with a norm that is smaller than in theorem  [ alr ] . in more detail",
    ": we define the integer @xmath84 by @xmath244 and establish below :      as in the proof of theorem  [ alr ] we find @xmath245 , where @xmath162 .",
    "thus in the case @xmath246 lemma  [ numint ] gives @xmath247 in the case @xmath248 the same conclusion obtains by using @xmath78 in place of @xmath204 .",
    "the claim then follows since the critical value of @xmath82 stays bounded by ( [ 3c ] ) .",
    "thus the crucial difference to theorem  [ alr ] is the stronger inequality provided by lemma  [ numint ] .",
    "the corresponding inequality for theorem  [ alr ] is @xmath249 , and the extra term @xmath37 causes the loss of efficiency in the case where the spatial extent @xmath37 becomes small .",
    "it remains to prove lemma  [ numint ] .",
    "elementary considerations show that one can find sets @xmath250 and @xmath251 , each consisting of @xmath252 consecutive integers , such that @xmath253 implies @xmath254 \\in   { \\cal j}(i_n)$ ] and also @xmath255 if @xmath256 , resp .",
    "@xmath257 if @xmath248 .",
    "thus in the latter case we immediately obtain @xmath258 and the claim of the lemma obtains with ( [ 3b ] ) , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 , which follows from @xmath248 . in the case @xmath256",
    ", only a subset of the @xmath261 intervals @xmath262 $ ] : @xmath263 belongs to @xmath264 , namely those for which both @xmath265 and @xmath266 lie on the @xmath75-grid .",

    "the same bound obtains for the number of indices @xmath266 that lie on the @xmath75-grid .",
