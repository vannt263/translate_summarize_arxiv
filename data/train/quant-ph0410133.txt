    "the implementation of positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) for photonic quantum state signals is important for a variety of quantum information protocols , in particular , for quantum communication schemes such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and collective decoding in quantum channel coding @xcite . unlike conventional optical detection technologies ,",
    "povms for optical quantum information protocols generally include a projection onto superposition states or entangled states . in order to implement such measurements , normally",
    "a nonlinear interaction of the signal states ( described by a hamiltonian at least cubic in the optical mode operators @xcite ) is needed . at present , however , these nonlinear processes are hard to realize on the level of single photons .",
    "one possibility for inducing a nonlinear element is to exploit the effective nonlinearity associated with a measurement .",
    "in particular , for photonic - qubit states , universal gating operations and hence any povm for these states can be realized asymptotically by using linear optics , photon counting , highly entangled auxiliary states of @xmath0 photons , and conditional dynamics ( feedforward ) .",
    "here , conditional dynamics means the successive application of linear transformations on the remaining modes conditioned upon the detection of a subset of modes @xcite . in the special case of a projection measurement , corresponding to the discrimination of an orthogonal set of states ,",
    "perfect distinguishability is achieved in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0 . however , with current technology , it is hard to generate the entangled auxiliary states even for modest @xmath0 .",
    "more recent investigations , therefore , have focused on the question whether one can implement a given measurement , or more generally a set of universal quantum gates , via cheaper and/or finite resources .",
    "for example , by applying the cluster - state model of quantum computation @xcite to linear optics @xcite , the cost of the extra entangled resources may be significantly reduced @xcite .    in this paper , we address the following question : is it possible to implement a given projection measurement in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many , arbitrarily fast conditional - dynamics steps without using any entangled auxiliary states at all ?",
    "thereby , the intermediate detections upon which the conditional dynamics relies are not supposed to be finite either , but they shall be arbitrarily weak .",
    "in other words , instead of using arbitrarily expensive auxiliary states of arbitrarily many photons and a finite number of finite measurements plus feedforward @xcite , we employ infinitely many steps of feedforward alone , based upon arbitrarily weak measurements .",
    "in fact , a nice example for the latter approach was already given by dolinar @xcite in the field of quantum communication and detection theory , namely , for the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent signals .",
    "as an extension of the conventional signal detection theory , quantum detection theory has been studied to give an optimal signal decision strategy for noncommutative quantum signals @xcite .",
    "it is motivated by fundamental interest , but it also aims at investigating ultimate performance of optical communication systems where information is usually carried by coherent - state signals .",
    "now , in this context , the simplest scenario would be a communication scheme that is based on the discrimination of the binary phase - shift keyed ( bpsk ) coherent signals @xmath1 ( in the following , simply called the binary coherent signals ) .",
    "the optimal povm that discriminates these nonorthogonal signal states with the minimum average error is described by a projection onto the orthonormal basis consisting of superposition states of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this scheme is sometimes called the helstrom measurement @xcite .",
    "kennedy @xcite first showed a simple physical model that achieves the near - optimal measurement : the binary signal is displaced to @xmath4 and then measured by a photodetector that discriminates whether the signal contains photons or not .",
    "dolinar @xcite ( see also @xcite ) extended the kennedy scheme demonstrating that the perfect implementation of the helstrom measurement is possible by using linear optics , photon counting , and _ infinitesimally fast _ feedforward .",
    "other related proposals on the implementation of the ( near-)optimal measurement of binary coherent states were given in refs.@xcite .",
    "a brief description of dolinar s original proposal is the following @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dolinar ] , the coherent signal field @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) within the time interval @xmath7 is displaced by one of the two local oscillators ( los ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 and then incident into a photodetector .",
    "the photodetector is assumed to have infinitesimal time resolution and the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are appropriately chosen to minimize the error probability .",
    "the choice of @xmath8 or @xmath9 at time @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) depends on whether the totally detected number of photons during @xmath12 is even or odd .",
    "therefore , once a signal photon triggers a detector click , the current lo immediately has to be switched to the other setting . after detecting the whole signal",
    ", one can infer whether the signal was @xmath13 or @xmath14 by looking at the parity of the number of the detected photons .",
    "this scheme achieves the minimum error probability after making an optimization of the likelyhood ratio of the binary signal with optimal control theory @xcite . in the original paper @xcite ,",
    "the analysis was semiclassical and later a fully quantum mechanical description was given @xcite .",
    "more recently , the system performance under the realistic situation including delay of feedforward , finite bandwidth and imperfect detection has been investigated @xcite .",
    "compared to previous works on the dolinar scheme , our contribution here contains basically four new aspects .",
    "first , we revisit the derivation of a dolinar - type measurement scheme .",
    "however , instead of focusing on the original signals latexmath:[$\\ {    measurement onto the basis latexmath:[$\\ {    error discrimination of the signal states . we can then ask whether one can discriminate the orthogonal states latexmath:[$\\ {    infinitely weak detections . in such a scheme , during the entire measurement , the conditional states in every detection and feedforward step must remain orthogonal . using this constraint ,",
    "the derivation of the dolinar protocol becomes simpler and more transparent .",
    "further , no complicated optimization procedures are needed .",
    "in order to discuss the dolinar receiver in the context of linear - optics quantum information processing , we translate dolinar s original scheme from the time domain to the spatial domain . in other words , infinitesimally fast feedforward is replaced by an infinite use of spatial resources .    the dolinar receiver .",
    "the signal @xmath5 and the local oscillator are combined at a highly transmissive beamsplitter such that the signal is displaced to @xmath16 .",
    "the appropriate choice of @xmath17 at @xmath10 is determined by the number of the detected photons during @xmath18 ( for details , see the text ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    secondly , we prove that there is no finite detection scheme that attains the helstrom bound for the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent states .",
    "such a no - go statement can be made by using a set of criteria for the _ exact _ discrimination of orthogonal states in a projection measurement @xcite .",
    "these criteria express in a simple way the requirement that the orthogonal states must remain orthogonal after a linear - optics transformation followed by the detection of a first mode .",
    "for instance , in a bell measurement for polarization - encoded photonic qubits , this requirement can never be met and hence the bell measurement can not be implemented with linear optics including photon counting , finite steps of conditional dynamics , and arbitrary auxiliary photon states @xcite .",
    "asymptotic schemes @xcite are not included in this approach .",
    "for the example of binary coherent states investigated here , finite feedforward means that the linear - optics transformation of the signal and auxiliary modes before the first detection step involves a nonzero mixing between the signal mode and the mode to be detected . of course",
    ", in the case of zero mixing , the orthogonality can be trivially preserved . here",
    "we will show how to accomplish the helstrom measurement based on feedforward using infinitely weak detections .",
    "a third new aspect of our work is to demonstrate that the dolinar approach can be applied not only to the helstrom measurement of binary coherent states , but also to other measurements . in particular , we apply the dolinar approach to a projection measurement in the regime of photonic - qubit signals . for a particular example , for which any finite linear - optics scheme must fail , we show that the dolinar approach succeeds .",
    "last but not least , our analysis of the dolinar scheme in the view of the recent developments in linear - optics quantum information processing demonstrates that by using infinitely many steps of feedforward instead of arbitrarily expensive entangled photon states , an asymptotically perfect efficiency of a projection measurement is possible .",
    "related to this , we note that there is another proposal for an asymptotic linear - optics implementation of a quantum measurement in which suboptimal unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) of @xmath19 symmetric coherent states for @xmath20 is achieved without expensive auxiliary resources @xcite . for @xmath21",
    ", the optimal usd can be easily done non - asymptotically by using a @xmath22 beamsplitter and photon counting @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe a linear - optics circuit in which a sequence of arbitrarily weak measurements are asymptotically combined to a continuous measurement .",
    "in particular , we discuss the linear - optics circuit that corresponds to the dolinar receiver in the spatial domain .",
    "a fully quantum - mechanical description of the dolinar receiver was described in ref .",
    "@xcite by applying a continuous photon - counting measurement based on the quantum markov process model @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the continuous measurement based on photon counting with a local oscillator by a sequence of linear optics and photodetection .",

    "so we send the states @xmath155 into the measurement apparatus .",
    "let us assume that the first photon is detected at the @xmath64-th detector and no photon is counted during @xmath102 .",
    "the outcoming signals are then given by @xmath156 the orthogonality condition for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qubit_no - count_1 - 0 ] ) and ( [ eq : qubit_no - count_1 - 1 ] ) implies an appropriate local oscillator function for @xmath155 , namely @xmath157 when choosing the plus solution for @xmath158 , eqs .",

    "let us consider the next interval @xmath162 , where we assume that the second photon is detected at @xmath125 . defining the local oscillator function @xmath163",
    ", we obtain    @xmath164    now the orthogonality condition implies @xmath165 more generally , the local oscillator function for the interval @xmath166 is given by @xmath167 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubit_logeneral ] ) , the signal states after the whole detection process are described by @xmath168 , @xmath128 , where @xmath75 is the total number of detected photons and @xmath169 .",
    "when @xmath75 is zero or even , the final states are @xmath170 these are still orthogonal to each other in any order of @xmath67 . on the other hand , when @xmath75 is odd , we have latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : qubit_odd }",
    "\\\\    finds that it is possible to distinguish @xmath130 and @xmath137 perfectly by checking the parity of the totally detected photon number .",
    "let us finally mention that the projection onto arbitrary orthogonal superpositions of the vacuum state @xmath76 and the single photon state @xmath143 , @xmath172 can be achieved in the same manner as described above .",
    "in summary , we systematically derived a scheme which is equivalent to the original dolinar receiver for implementing the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent - state signals .",
    "this scheme corresponds to a spatial version of the dolinar receiver , based upon linear optics , photodetectors , continuous measurement and feedforward . in our approach , as opposed to previous works , we focus on the ( asymptotically ) perfect implementation of a given projection measurement . in order to derive the dolinar - type scheme",
    ", we consider the projection measurement that corresponds to the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent - state signals .",
    "the derivation then relies on the constraint that , for discriminating the orthogonal states of the measurement basis , the conditional states in each detection and feedforward step must remain orthogonal .",
    "this new derivation method does not require complicated optimization procedures and is applicable to various kinds of projection measurements .",
    "we showed that not only the particular measurement associated with the coherent - state signals treated in dolinar s original proposal , but also other types of projection measurements can be implemented via continuous measurement and feedforward .",
    "significantly , in our approach , optimal measurement performance , i.e. , the maximum measurement efficiency allowed by quantum mechanics , is achieved without the need of expensive entangled auxiliary resources . however",
    ", finite feedforward plus arbitrarily many auxiliary photons must be replaced by arbitrarily fast feedforward based on arbitrarily weak measurements .",
    "although we considered only projection measurements of a single - mode field in this paper , our methodology might be applicable to more general scenarios as well , including generalized measurements or joint projective measurements for more modes .",
    "while the possibility of a linear - optics implementation of such scenarios has been studied already @xcite , it remains an open question whether the approach based on continuous measurement and feedforward allows for an optimal efficiency also in these more general schemes .",
    "finally , an important question is whether our scheme can be used in a real , necessarily finite , physical implementation . in order to address this question",
    ", one would have to consider a discrete analogue of our scheme , including finite feedforward and weak , but finite measurements .",
    "one may then determine bounds in terms of suitable figures of merit , e.g. the minimum average error or the maximum success probability , for given feedforward resources .",
    "the authors thank m.  ban for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg under the emmy - noether program , the eu fet network ramboq and the network of competence qip of the state of bavaria .",
    "regardless of the number of photodetections , the signal loses its energy during the measurement process .",
    "if the signal contains a vacuum - state component , a zero - photon counting event increases the probability amplitude for the vacuum [ the second exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_l1-l0 ] ) ] .",
    "the average energy of the signal then decreases .",
    "even if the initial signal does not contain the vacuum component , e.g. a single - photon state , the process in our setup still acts as a dissipative process . since a displacement is not an energy preserving operation , it redistributes the amplitude coefficients of the partial state [ the mode b in fig .",
    "[ fig : continuousmeasurement](a ) ] across the different number states including the vacuum state . as a result ,",
    "even if the photon counting projects the partial state onto the vacuum , the partial state may have contained non - zero energy before the displacement . in other words ,",
    "this event can create some vacuum - state component in the remaining signal [ mathematically , this is due to the annihilation operator in the first exponential term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_l1-l0 ] ) ] .",
    "as mentioned above , once the state includes the vacuum component , the state loses its energy due to photon counting ."
