    "in the past several years , as a new type of two - dimensional material , monolayer ( ml ) transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have attracted much attention partly due to their novel optical properties arising from their unique band structures.@xcite with the direct energy gap and large energy splitting of the valence bands,@xcite the chiral optical valley selection rule allows the optical control of the valley and spin degrees in ml tmds , which are mainly realized by the excitonic excitation.@xcite consisting of two ml tmds , with the added layer degree of freedom , bilayer ( bl ) tmds also exhibit rich optical properties due to the preservation of the chiral optical valley selection rule,@xcite apart from the new features such as the electrical polarization , electrical - tuned magnetic moments and magnetoelectric effect.@xcite specifically , due to the added layer degree of freedom in bl tmds , the optical - excited electron and hole can not only stay in the same layer , which form the intra - layer ( il ) exciton , but also in different layers referred to as the charge - transfer ( ct ) exciton [ the configurations for the a and b il ( ct ) excitons in the k valley are shown in fig .",
    "[ figyw1 ] ] .",
    "furthermore , due to the inter - layer coupling , the two kinds of excitons can couple to form a new elementary excitation : excimer.@xcite therefore , bl tmds may provide an ideal platform to study the excimer optical excitation and related photoluminescence ( pl ) depolarization dynamics .",
    "very recently , a great deal of attention has been drawn to bl tmds from theoretical and experimental aspects.@xcite the theoretical studies show that only the hole with the same spin in the same valley can hop between different layers efficiently in bl tmds.@xcite however , it is further claimed that due to the inter - layer hopping energy of the hole is smaller than the energy splitting of the valence bands , the inter - layer hopping of the hole is markedly suppressed and hence there may exist spin - layer locking effect in bl tmds.@xcite in this sense , bl tmds can be treated as two separated ml tmds , which has been used to understand the recent experiments related to the optical exciton excitation and pl depolarization dynamics.@xcite    experimentally , the optical exciton spectra and related pl depolarization dynamics in bl tmds are in active progress.@xcite the recent pl experiments in bl tmds show that the spectra of the optical excitation is very different from the ml situation.@xcite on one hand , in the bl tmd heterostructures , excitation energy much lower than the one in ml tmds is observed and attributed to be ct exciton , whose lifetime is found to be as long as nanoseconds.@xcite on the other hand , in the experiments for the bl ws@xmath0 carried out by zhu _",
    "et al._,@xcite it has been observed that there are four resonance excitations with excitation energies approximately being 1.68 , 1.93 , 1.99 and 2.37  ev , respectively , rather than the two excitations named a and b excitons with resonance energies approximately being 2.03 and 2.40  ev in the ml ws@xmath0 .",
    "these four excitations are speculated to be the indirect exciton for the @xmath1 valley , trion , a exciton and b exciton excitations , respectively.@xcite specifically , compared to the ml ws@xmath0 , the obvious redshift for the a exciton energy about 30 @xmath2 50  mev is observed in the bl ws@xmath0 in these experiments.@xcite moreover , in the work of zhao _",
    "et al._,@xcite the additional lowest excitations for the bl mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 are also reported and claimed to be the indirect excitation in the @xmath1 valley , which is in contrast to the understanding in the bl tmd heterostructures.@xcite furthermore , the behavior of the pl depolarization dynamics for the bl ws@xmath0 is revealed to be very different from the ml situation.@xcite zhu _ et al .",
    "_ has observed that with the same experimental conditions , the steady - state pl polarization for the excitation 1.99 ev ( so - called a exciton ) is nearly 100@xmath5 in the bl ws@xmath0 , which is anomalously larger than the one measured in the ml ws@xmath0 ( less than @xmath6).@xcite however , based on the spin - layer locking picture,@xcite this pl depolarization dynamics is very hard to understand according to the previous study in ml tmds,@xcite where the intrinsic electron - hole ( e - h ) exchange interaction can cause efficient pl depolarization due to the maialle - silva - sham ( mss ) mechanism.@xcite    in this paper , we present a possible understanding of the above observations that is different from the above speculations.@xcite in our picture , the speculated indirect exciton , which involves a high - order phonon absorption / emission process , is unnecessary . in bl tmds , due to the strong coulomb interaction,@xcite",
    "the e - h pair can form not only the il exciton but also the ct one . furthermore , due to the inter - layer hopping of the hole , the il and ct excitons can couple together to form the excimer.@xcite here , although the dark exciton can also contribute to the formation of the excimer state , on one hand , it has negligible influence on the excimer energy level ; on the other hand , it can not be excited in the optical process .",
    "hence , in the optical process , only the bright exciton needs to be considered .",
    "furthermore , in the bl ws@xmath0 , although there exists large energy splitting for the valence bands , due to the anisotropy of dielectric constant,@xcite the a il and b ct exciton states are nearly degenerate and hence can couple together to form the @xmath3 and @xmath4 excimer states with the energy level calculated to be 1.99 and 2.10  ev , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the binding energy for the excimer states are calculated to be 40 mev , showing good agreement with the observed redshift for the a exciton in the bl ws@xmath0.@xcite moreover , the energy level for the lowest and highest excitations are calculated to be 1.69 and 2.41 ev , which correspond to the a ct and b il excitons , also showing good agreement with the experiment.@xcite therefore , according to our calculation , the understanding of the four excitations is different from the speculation in the experiments , with the lowest three excitations being the a ct exciton , @xmath3 excimer and @xmath4 excimer rather than the indirect excitation for the @xmath1 valley , trion and a exciton.@xcite    we further study the exchange interaction between the two excimer states we reveal in the bl ws@xmath0 , based on which we perform the investigation of the pl depolarization dynamics by the kinetic spin bloch equations ( ksbes ) in the pump - probe setup.@xcite we find both the coulomb interaction and inter - layer hopping of the hole can contribute to the exchange interaction in both the intra- and inter - valley situations .",
    "these dominant processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figyw1 ] for the intra - valley situation . on one hand ,",
    "the e - h pair in one il exciton can virtually recombine and then generate another il exciton due to the coulomb interaction directly . on the other hand",
    ", there exists another higher - order process , in which the hole in the ct exciton first hops from one layer to another and then recombines virtually with the electron part to generate the il exciton due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "these exciton transition processes can cause the excimer transition efficiently due to the mss mechanism,@xcite with the former process is more important than the latter .",
    "we then perform the investigation of the pl depolarization dynamics by the ksbes in the pump - probe setup.@xcite the calculations based on the ksbes show that with the absorption of the @xmath7 light , the emergence of the @xmath8 light can be instantaneous , which is similar to ml tmds.@xcite furthermore , there is always an anomalous residual pl polarization as large as @xmath9 exactly , lasting for extremely long time , which is robust against the initial energy broadening and strength of the momentum scattering .",
    "this indicates that the pl depolarization time @xmath10 can be much longer than the excimer lifetime @xmath11 , which is in the order of picoseconds.@xcite accordingly , based on the rate equation,@xcite this provides a reasonable explanation for the anomalously large steady - state pl polarization nearly @xmath12 observed in the experiment of zhu _ et al .",
    "_ in the bl ws@xmath0.@xcite we further reveal that this anomalous _ steady state",
    "_ originates from the specific form of the exchange interaction hamiltonian .",
    "it is interesting to see that there exists a density matrix in the steady state but with residual pl polarization , which can commute with the exchange interaction hamiltonian and hence protects the large residual pl polarization .",
    "moreover , for the system pumped by the elliptically polarized light , we demonstrate that the residual pl polarization is always half of the initial polarization of the elliptically polarized light .",
