    "due to the coulomb interaction between the charge carriers , collective excitations called plasmons may result as the electromagnetic response in a solid - state structure .",
    "these excitations have been extensively investigated in bulk and low - dimensional systems from both theoretical and experimental points of view.@xcite however , the interest on plasma excitations has been renewed due to the experimental possibility of tailoring interactions such as spin - orbit coupling , which may affect the properties of the plasmons.@xcite the recent ability of producing novel two - dimensional systems such as graphene has also motivated new investigations of the plasmon dispersion.@xcite    interestingly , collective excitations can also emerge in systems involving two spatially separated two - dimensional electron gases which couple to each other through the coulomb interaction.@xcite a typical example is the excitation of different plasmon modes in bilayer systems , where two quasi-2d electron systems ( each with only the lowest subband being occupied ) are separated by a potential barrier .",
    "even when the potential barrier is large and the tunneling is largely suppressed , the interlayer coulomb interaction may couple the two quasi-2d electron systems if the interlayer separation ( barrier width ) is small enough .",
    "in such a case there are intralayer plasmon excitations in which the electrons in one of the layers may collectively oscillate in phase ( optic plasmon mode ) or out of phase ( acoustic plasmon mode ) with the electron oscillations in the neighboring layer.@xcite by decreasing the barrier , the tunneling becomes relevant and splits the single subband in each quasi-2d electron system . as a result",
    "new excitations consisting of interlayer collective charge oscillations ( intersubband or transverse plasmons ) appear.@xcite such interlayer collective oscillations have recently been re - interpreted as pseudospin excitations.@xcite    within the pseudospin approach , the electrons in one of the layers are assigned one pseudospin state and the electrons in the other layer the opposite pseudospin.@xcite the interlayer excitations can be regarded as pseudospin excitations mediated by the tunneling strength , which acts on the pseudospins as an effective magnetic field .",
    "thus , analogous to the conventional ferromagnetic resonance in magnetized materials whose electron spins are manipulated by an external magnetic field , the tunneling ( effective magnetic field ) in the bilayer system leads to a pseudospin resonance describing the interlayer collective mode ( intersubband plasmon).@xcite furthermore , since the pseudospin degree of freedom is an analog to the real spin , new _ pseudospintronic _",
    "devices could be realized by means of controlled pseudospin manipulation , in close analogy with the control of real spin in spintronics applications.@xcite in particular , a pseudospintronic device based on semiconductor bilayers has theoretically been suggested@xcite as the analog to the conventional spin - transfer oscillator.@xcite    due to many - body effects the magnetization dynamics in magnetized systems are affected by the so - called gilbert damping.@xcite such effects also have their analog in bilayer systems , where the coulomb electron - electron interaction produces a shifting of the pseudospin resonance frequency and leads to a finite lifetime of the excitations ( that is , to damping).@xcite therefore , the investigation of the pseudospin excitations is of relevance for understanding the nature of correlations in bilayer - like systems .",
    "another interesting issue is the investigation of the pseudospin resonance in systems with more exotic geometries .",
    "nowadays techniques allow for the realization of a wide range of possible geometries by using semiconductors or carbon based materials , for example . from this point of view ,",
    "the phenomenon of pseudospin resonance offers the possibility of investigating many - body effects under different geometric configurations . in what follows we focus our discussion on the case of generic coaxial nanotubes which can be experimentally realized from a variety of materials including metals , metal - oxides , carbon , and semiconductors.@xcite coaxial nanotubes are particularly interesting systems for pseudospintronics , since they exhibit both the bilayer - like behavior of pseudospin excitations and the interplay between many - body and coherent effects which become apparent when a coaxial magnetic flux pierces the system .",
    "in such a case , as will be shown below , pseudospin resonance can be induced not only by an external electric field but also by fluctuations of the coaxial magnetic field .",
    "although there have been some investigations on plasma excitations in coaxial nanotubes@xcite these studies were limited to the non - tunneling regime treated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . here",
    ", we consider the possibility of tunneling ( and therefore of pseudospin excitations ) between the inner and outer tubes .",
