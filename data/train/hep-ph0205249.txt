    "one of the major challenges in qcd is the description of high energy scattering phenomena . in the high center - of - mass energy @xmath2 and in the perturbative domain",
    "when @xmath3 the scattering amplitude is obtained by the summation of diagrams leading in @xmath4 @xcite . at this level , when @xmath5 is frozen , the dependence of the resulting cross section on the energy is governed by the power law @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the bjorken variable .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is provided by the minimum of the eigenvalue function @xmath9 of the bfkl evolution kernel .",
    "the conceptual problem in this approach is the fact that at sufficiently high center - of - mass energies the bfkl amplitude violates the froissart unitarity bound .",
    "this means that the validity of this approach is strongly limited and it has to be modified at very small @xmath1 in order to guarantee the unitarity of the resulting cross section .",
    "the solution to this problem can be provided by including the recombination effects , which are likely to occur at very small values of @xmath1 @xcite . by decreasing the value of @xmath1 at fixed gluon virtuality @xmath10 ,",
    "the density of partons becomes so large that they start to overlap . in this case",
    "the gluon splitting process must be supplemented by a competing gluon recombination . in terms of evolution",
    "the master equations become nonlinear with an additional quadratic term which suppress the growth of the amplitude with energy and restore the unitarity .",
    "there have been extensive studies on this problem , see @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , which result in the nonlinear evolution .",
    "one of the important outcomes of these studies is the existence of the saturation scale @xmath11 which is a characteristic scale at which the parton recombination effects become important .",
    "in particular case of the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite the existence of such scale has yet another important impact on the picture of the bfkl evolution . the diffusion into the infra - red , which is the charactersitic property of bfkl evolution is strongly limited due to the existence of the saturation scale @xcite . in fact , in the regime when the gluon transverse momenta @xmath12 , the solution to the nonlinear equation @xcite becomes a function of only one combined variable @xmath13 @xcite-@xcite . in the regime of high momenta ,",
    "@xmath14 the parton density is small and the evolution is governed by a normal linear equation .    in this talk",
    "we present the analytical and numerical analysis of the balitsky - kovchegov @xcite equation which is a nonlinear evolution equation in the leading @xmath4 limit .",
    "we illustrate the emergence of the saturation scale and scaling and show that it leads to the suppression of the infra - red diffusion .",
    "we also consider the case with additional nll effects such as kinematical constraint and running coupling .",
    "the results presented in this talk have been obtained in the collaboration with k. golec - biernat and l. motyka . for the details of the calculation the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite has been derived as an evolution equation for the dipole - nucleus amplitude in the dipole picture by a summation of multiple pomeron exchanges in the leading @xmath15 level and in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "the resulting evolution equation reads    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , and the linear term is determined by the bfkl kernel @xmath19 the function @xmath20 is the dipole - nucleus amplitude for the scattering of the dipole with transverse size @xmath21 at impact parameter @xmath22 and at rapidity @xmath23 .    in the linear approximation , when each dipole scatters only once off the nucleus , the bfkl equation in the dipole picture is obtained . the non - linear term in ( [ eq : kov ] ) takes into account multiple scatterings and is essentially determined by the triple pomeron vertex @xcite in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "( [ eq : kov ] ) unitarizes the bfkl pomeron in the sense that at @xmath24 and @xmath25 fixed , @xmath26 thus the power - like rise with energy for the bfkl pomeron is tamed @xcite .",
    "for the subsequent analysis we shall assume the approximation of the big nucleus , i.e. @xmath27 which allows us to factorize the impact parameter dependence in eq.([eq : kov ] ) .",
    "we also consider the spherical symmetric solutions in @xmath21 and transform the equation ( [ eq : kov ] ) into the momentum space by performing the fourier transform @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bessel function . in this case",
    "the following equation is obtained @xmath30 and the action of the bfkl kernel is given by @xmath31 where now @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons in the bfkl ladder .",
    "in order to study the diffusion and scaling properties of the solution we shall consider the function @xmath34 . in the case of the linear bfkl equation this function is a gaussian concentrated around some initial scale @xmath35 and with width increasing with rapidity , leading to a diffusion . in fig.[fig : distr ] we illustrate this distribution for the case of the solution to the linear bfkl and in the nonlinear balitsky - kovchegov equation for different choices of rapidity . as an initial condition",
    "we have chosen a delta function @xmath36 . in the case of the linear bfkl evolution",
    "the solution is always peaked at @xmath37 and exhibits the well known diffusion pattern , in which the momentum distribution has an increasing width with growing rapidity .",
    "in the nonlinear case however the solution behavies quite differently .",
    "the peak of the distribution @xmath38 moves towards higher @xmath32 values as the rapidity increases and the solution becomes washed out from the @xmath39 regime . only in the region",
    "@xmath40 it coincides with the linear evolution .",
    "the impact of unitarization of the bfkl pomeron on the infra - red behaviour can be also visualised by studying the properties of the following normalised distribution @xmath41 and by performing the projection of this function onto the ( @xmath42 ) plane , fig .",
    "[ fig : proj ] .    again , for small @xmath23 , when the non - linearity in the bk equation is negligible , the re - normalized solutions ( [ eq : norm ] ) of the bfkl and the bk equations coincide . with increasing y ,",
    "when the non - linear effects become important , the difference between them in the region of small @xmath32 becomes fully visible .",
    "note that in certain region of ( @xmath42 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : proj ] the contours become parallel straight lines .",
    "this means that @xmath43 in this region is a function of the combination @xmath44 instead of @xmath32 and @xmath23 separately .",
    "this is referred as the geometric scaling property .",
    "we note , that this scaling holds in the regime where @xmath45 and becomes violated when @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that we can identify the saturation scale @xmath47 with @xmath38 @xmath48 with the exponential dependence on rapidity governed by the value of the scaling parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : newkov ] ) has the same scaling property as the function @xmath50 namely @xmath51 provided that @xmath52 .",
    "we have checked that this condition is satisfied .",
    "we have checked that the scaling coefficient @xmath49 ( [ eq : satscale ] ) is a universal quantity and it does not depend on the type of the input distribution whereas the normalisation @xmath53 is determined by the initial conditions .",
    "the transition between the scaling and linear regime can be perhaps best seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] where the function @xmath54 is plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath55 for different values of the rapidity @xmath23 .",
    "the scaling behaviour is represented by a common line to the left of the point @xmath56 .",
    "the slow departure from scaling for @xmath57 is clearly visible . in this sense",
    "the line @xmath58 is only an approximation characterizing the position of the transition region in the @xmath59-plane .",
    "however , the choice based on the position in @xmath32 of the maximum of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath23 is the most natural one .    from the numerical solution",
    "we have extracted the value of the scaling parameter and found @xmath61 which is in agreement with the estimates of @xcite for the balitsky - kovchegov equation and also with the previous work @xcite .",
    "the geometric scaling is also the property of the golec - biernat and wsthoff saturation model @xcite which succesfully described the data on inclusive and diffractive proton structure function . in this model",
    "it is assumed that the whole energy dependence of the dipole cross section @xmath62 is driven through the saturation scale @xmath47 ( or saturation radius @xmath63 ) .",
    "it then results in an approximate scaling property of the data for the total photon - proton cross section @xmath64 such scaling law was found in the small-@xmath1 dis data @xcite .",
    "the balitsky - kovchegov equation has been derived in the leading @xmath15 level , therefore it is important to study the impact of the subleading corrections . although it has been argued @xcite that the unitarity corrections might become important before next - to - leading ones , the study of the latter ones is crucial due to the large numerical value of the subleading series .",
    "after the evaluation of the nll contribution to the bfkl amplitude has been performed @xcite it turned out that the correction is very large and need to be resummed @xcite in order to stablize the final result .    we have tested two important types of the nll corrections : the inclusion of running of the coupling @xmath65 and the so called kinematical constraint .    in the case of linear bfkl",
    "the running of the coupling poses serious problems due to the existence of the landau pole and thus it is necessary to regularise @xmath65 at small scales .",
    "this results in a strong dependence of the solution on the cut - off ( or freezing ) parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the intercept of the bfkl pomeron turns out to be dominated by the values of @xmath66 and instead of the typical diffusion pattern one has a factorized behaviour of the solution @xmath67^{\\nu}$ ] at large rapidities .",
    "the distribution of the gluon momenta is dominanted by the virtualities in the infrared regime @xmath68 .    in the case of the balitsky - kovchegov equation with the running coupling",
    "one has still problem of regularisation around the landau pole , however the solution is itself much more stable with respect to the details of the phenomenological regularisation .",
    "it turns out , that since the saturation effects are very strong in the regime of small values of @xmath32 , they tend to decrease the rapid rise of the amplitude for the values of running coupling evaluated at scales around the cutoff scale @xmath35 .",
    "the rapidity - dependent saturation scale , @xmath47 shifts the momentum distribution out of the infrared regime into the perturbative domain .",
    "this phenomenon can be best visualized by means of similar contour plots as before , fig.[fig : conrun ] . in the linear bfkl case one",
    "observes that the solution initially undergoes the diffusion pattern , slightly asymmetric due to corrections coming from the running coupling , and then suddenly it drops into the small scales regime @xmath69 where it exhibits factorized ( in @xmath23 and @xmath70 ) behaviour .",
    "on the contrary , the balitsky -kovchegov equation which initially coincides with bfkl , also undergoes some form of transition but then the distribution moves away from the infrared regime due to the generation of the saturation scale .",
    "we have estimated the saturation scale in the case of balitsky - kovchegov equation with running coupling . by taking the ansatz that the local exponent @xmath71 takes the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 we have found that the saturation scale is given by the solution to the differential equation @xmath74 with the initial condition @xmath75 and @xmath76 chosen in the region where scaling sets in .",
    "the solution takes the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that the local exponent @xmath79 decreases with increasing rapidity , and @xmath80 for very large @xmath23 .",
    "such dependence is indeed seen in the numerical analysis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalerun ] we illustrate scaling in the case with running coupling by showing the function @xmath81 plotted versus @xmath55 for different values of rapidity .",
    "@xmath47 is given by formula ( [ eq : satscalerc ] ) with the initial condition @xmath82 .",
    "the overlapping curves at low values of the scaling variable clearly indicate that for @xmath83 scaling is satisfied to a very good accuracy , thus justifying our ansatz ( [ eq : satscalerc ] ) for the saturation scale .",
    "we have also tested the impact of the so called kinematical constraint onto the solution of balitsky - kovchegov equation and found that though qualitative features are the same ( with generation of the saturation scale and scaling ) the absolute numerical value of the solution is strongly decreased and also the saturation scale is shifted towards smaller value of gluon momenta .    to summarize , the diffusion into infrared in the case of the balitsky - kovchegov equation is strongly suppressed due to the emergence of the saturation scale which can be approximately identified with the maximum of the momentum distribution @xmath34 .",
    "the solution to the nonlinear equation has the property of the geometric scaling in the regime where @xmath83 whereas in the case when @xmath57 the solution enters the linear regime . in the case of running",
    "coupling the nonlinear equation turns out to be more stable as compared with the linear bfkl evolution .",
    "the sensitivity to the treatment of the infra - red region is much smaller than in the linear case due to the appearance of the saturation scale .",
    "in contrast to the bfkl equation with the running coupling , the large @xmath23 asymptotics of the dipole scattering amplitude arising from the bk equation is governed by gluon momenta in the perturbative domain .",
