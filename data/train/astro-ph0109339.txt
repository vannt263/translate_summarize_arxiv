    "in radio - quiet active galactic nuclei , large amounts of cold material are thought to reside at large distance from the central engine .",
    "in particular , the unified scheme ( antonucci 1993 ) postulates a large scale torus ( with radius larger than @xmath2 cm ) . such distant cold material ( hereafter dcm )",
    "may imprint strong reflection features in the hard x - ray spectrum of seyfert 1 galaxies ( ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ; krolik , madau & ycki 1994 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the reflection produced by an irradiated torus would be sufficient to account for the typical observed reflection spectra , without need for reflecting material in the inner parts of the accretion flow ( e.g. disc reflection ) .    in compton",
    "thick seyfert 2s , the observed reflection dominated spectra are generally interpreted by dcm reflection with the primary emission obscured presumably by the same outer material ( e.g. reynold _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; matt _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .    in seyfert 1s",
    ", the detection of a narrow iron line component ( lubinski & zdziarski 2000 ) is also suggestive of reflection on dcm .",
    "probably , the best evidence for significant reflection on dcm in a seyfert 1 , comes from the bepposax and rxte observation of ngc4051 in a very low flux state .",
    "both spectral and timing data were found consistent with the interpretation that the source had switched off , leaving only a spectrum of pure reflection from dcm at distances larger than @xmath3 cm ( guainazzi _ et al._1998 , uttley _",
    "et al._1999 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to emphasize some observable effects introduced by dcm reflection and discuss these effects in the context of the reported @xmath0@xmath1 correlation ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ) .",
    "when analyzing the x - ray data , the possible contribution from dcm reflection is not considered a priori .",
    "the data are generally interpreted in the framework of reflection in the vicinity of the hard x - ray source , possibly on the accretion disc . usually , in spectral fits , the shape of the reflection component is computed assuming that the _ observed _ primary spectrum illuminates an infinite disc ( e.g. pexrav model in xpec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the normalization of the reflected spectrum is then tuned in order to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "the results of this fitting procedure provides the reflection amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is normalized so that @xmath4 in the case of an isotropic source above an infinite reflecting plane .",
    "@xmath0 is often considered as an estimate of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the solid angle subtended by the reflector as seen from the isotropic x - ray source .",
    "obviously , any contribution from a remote structure leads to an increase of @xmath0 and may lead to an overestimate of the disc reflection .",
    "this may explain the very large @xmath0 coefficients @xmath7 , measured in some seyfert 1s , which are difficult to reconcile with disc reflection ( see however beloborodov 1999 ; malzac , beloborodov & poutanen 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the nuclei of seyfert galaxies are known to harbor a significant variability on very short time scale ( @xmath8 1 day , see e.g. nicastro _ et al._2000 ; nandra _ et al._2000 ; chiang _ et al._2000 ) . due to its extended structure",
    "the remote reflector can not respond to the rapid fluctuations of the primary x - ray flux .",
    "_ the reflected component from the dcm is thus likely to correspond to the time - averaged incident flux rather than to the instantaneous ( i.e. observed ) one . _",
    "thus flux changes may induce a significant variation in the @xmath0 value derived from the spectral fits .",
    "a flux lower than the average enhances the apparent reflection , on the other hand , a larger flux may reduce @xmath0 down to zero",
    ". then values of @xmath0 as low or large as required by the data can be easily produced .",
    "this kind of effect , when important , makes the geometrical interpretation of @xmath0 extremely misleading .",
    "_ trying to disentangle the temporal and geometrical effects is extremely difficult _ and requires very long observations with time resolved spectral analysis .",
    "a significant contribution from a remote reflector seems , at first sight , in contradiction with the reported correlation between @xmath0 and the spectral slope @xmath1 ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith , 1999 ) .",
    "this correlation is observed in sample of sources as well as in the time evolution of individual sources .",
    "the measured @xmath0 tends to be larger in softer sources .",
    "the usual interpretation of the correlation invoke the feedback from reprocessed radiation emitted by the reflector itself .",
    "it thus absolutely requires a close reflector . in the context of dcm reflection , it is difficult to understand why the reflection contribution from dcm should be more important in objects with softer spectra .    it has been however suggested by nandra _",
    "et al._(2000 ) that , in the case of reflection on dcm , _ rapid spectral changes of the primary emission can strongly affect the measured @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 relation then depends on the specific spectral variability mode of the sources .",
    "_ it may possibly produce a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in several sources such as ngc5548 ( nicastro _ et al._2000 , petrucci _",
    "et al._2000 ) , the short time - scale variability is consistent with fluctuations of the x - ray spectral slope with a nearly constant comptonised luminosity , i.e. the spectrum is mainly pivoting .",
    "this can happen for example if the uv luminosity entering the hot comptonising plasma changes with a constant heating rate in the hot plasma ( e.g. malzac & jourdain 2000 ) . in the following we investigate the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 dependence for this variability mode .",
    "we assume that the time average primary spectrum seen by the dcm can be represented by a power law with a photon index @xmath9 and an exponential cut - off at 200 kev . neglecting any disc reflection",
    ", we further assume that the dcm geometry is such that the time averaged primary spectrum yield a reflection coefficient @xmath10 . as a first order approximation ,",
    "the shape of the reflection spectrum is computed using the pexrav procedure , i.e. assuming a slab reflector . fixing the cut - off energy at 200 kev , we produced a set of instantaneous primary spectra for several photon indices @xmath1 spanning the observed range 1.42.2 .",
    "the 1 kev normalization was tuned so that the 0.01100 kev luminosity was identical for all spectra .",
    "we then added the reflection component , produced as described above , to these instantaneous spectra , and fitted the resulting spectra with pexrav in the 2 - 30 kev range .",
    "we also fitted the simulated spectra in the 2100 kev range . in both energy ranges ,",
    "the derived best fit parameters were very similar .",
    "similarly , we estimated the effects of variability on the measured equivalent width ( ew ) of the iron line .",
    "we modeled the intrinsic iron line by a gaussian with an intrinsic width @xmath11 ev and a total flux normalized so that the ew is 50 ev for the @xmath9 time averaged primary spectra ( i.e. roughly consistent with a reflection amplitude @xmath10 ; george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation resulting from our modeling procedure is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the assumed variability mode ( i.e. variability at constant flux ) results in a spectrum pivoting at energies lower than 10 kev i.e. below the energy range were most of reflection is produced .",
    "thus , when the spectrum is hard the observed primary flux in the 1030 kev band is larger , and @xmath0 is reduced , on the other hand when the spectrum is soft the primary flux in this energy range is enhanced and @xmath0 is lower .",
    "it thus produces _ a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1_. fig .",
    "1 shows that _ the produced correlation qualitatively match the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation observed in the sample of _ ginga_data from zdziarski _",
    "et al._1999_. note that a spectral pivot above 10 - 20 kev would produce the an anti - correlation .",
    "fluctuations of the primary continuum do affect the measured ew .",
    "the resulting dependence of the measured equivalent width with @xmath1 is plotted on fig  2 .",
    "the ew represents the amount of reflection at 6.4 kev i.e. at a lower energy than the reflection bump .",
    "the correlation obtained for ew is weaker than for @xmath0 ( actually we even get an anti - correlation at low @xmath1 ) .    using a large asca sample , lubiski & zdziardski ( 2000 ) produced 3 average spectra of seyfert 1s grouped according to increasing spectral index . for each spectra",
    "they could detect a narrow fe line component that they attribute to reflection on a torus . _ their estimates for the narrow line",
    "ew appear to be consistent with the results from our modeling _ as show in fig  2 .",
    "we showed that the effect of the remote cold material may in principle account simultaneously for the observed correlation between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the observed narrow line component which is almost independent of @xmath1 .",
    "it should be stressed however , that the comparisons of our model with the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation observed in a _",
    "_ s__ample of sources , implicitly assumes that all the sources present a similar variability mode ( i.e. variability at constant flux ) , time average properties as well as geometry of the dcm .",
    "this is probably oversimplifying ( as suggested by the spread of the data points in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane ) .",
    "in particular in several sources a correlation between the 210 kev flux and spectral slope is reported ( e.g. chiang _ et al._2000 ) , while our variability assumptions lead to an anti - correlation . concerning the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation we implicitly assumed that the reflection on inner cold material ( e.g. disc reflection ) is negligible in all sources .",
    "this is probably not the case since the observed iron lines also present a broad component which is unlikely to be produced far away from the central engine .",
    "given these uncertainties , we conclude that beside the extreme dcm dominated case considered here for illustration , _ reflection arising from the dcm could be important in many sources _ , making any attempt to constrain the physical properties and the geometry of the central engine with reflection measurements very difficult .",
