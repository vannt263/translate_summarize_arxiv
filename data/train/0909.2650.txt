    "in the local universe , the most bolometrically luminous galaxies are dominated by thermal emission from dust which absorbs ultra - violet ( uv ) and optical light and re - radiates it in the infrared ( ir ) @xcite . while rare locally , these ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) are more common at high redshift . studies combining the improved sensitivity in the ir of the _ spitzer space telescope _ with wide - field ground - based optical imaging have identified a subset of this @xmath4 ulirg population that is ir - bright but also optically faint @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite present a simple and economical method for selecting these systems based on @xmath11-band and 24@xmath0 m multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; * ? ? ?",

    "while dogs are rare , they are sufficiently luminous ( @xmath20% of dogs with spectroscopic redshifts have @xmath21 ) that they may contribute up to one - quarter of the total ir luminosity density from all @xmath22 galaxies ( and over half that from all ulirgs at @xmath4 ) and may be the progenitors of the most luminous ( @xmath84@xmath23 ) present - day galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus far , the efforts to estimate the ir luminosities of dogs have primarily relied upon spectroscopic redshifts and the observed 24@xmath0 m flux density . @xcite use an empirical relation between the rest - frame 8@xmath0 m luminosity ( computed from the observed 24@xmath0 m flux density ) and the ir luminosity , derived by @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath111 for swire sources are uncertain due to the lack of data near the far - ir peak ( i.e. , observed - frame 160 or 350 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "@xcite analyze the stacked signal at 160@xmath0 m from these sources and find that the @xmath111 is higher by as much as 10  k than what is assumed in their table  [ tab : comparison ] . for a given 1.2 mm flux , increasing @xmath216 by 10  k will increase @xmath86 by a factor of @xmath133 and decrease @xmath206 by @xmath1350% .    the key result from table  [ tab : comparison ]",
    "is that while the dogs in our sample have lower dust masses than the other galaxy populations by a factor of @xmath220 , they have higher total ir and far - ir luminosities by factors of @xmath82 .",
    "this distinction is driven by the difference in @xmath111 , as dogs in the sample have higher values by @xmath1310 - 20  k compared to the other galaxy populations .    in terms of the stellar and gas mass estimates ,",
    "the relationship between dogs in botes ( i.e. , the sample studied in this paper ) and the remaining galaxy populations is unclear . even if a single dust temperature and a single dust to gas mass ratio for each of the sources studied in this paper is adopted , the uncertainties on the stellar mass estimates are large enough to allow greatly varying stellar mass to gas mass ratios .",
    "sources satisfying @xmath36>14 $ ] ( i.e. , dogs ) tend to have higher gas masses compared to @xmath36<14 $ ] sources ( under the assumption of a constant dust - to - gas mass ratio ) .",
    "this difference is at least in part due to a difference in dust temperatures ; within this sample , dogs have lower dust temperatures than non - dogs .",
    "this is in contrast with the evidence for high dust temperatures in the botes dogs studied in this paper and may be an indication that mm - detected dogs represent a special subset of dogs that is more representative of the mm - selected galaxy population than the dog population .",
    "an important caveat to this comparison is that we are dealing with small sample sizes due to incomplete coverage at one or more bands from the mid- to the far - ir .",
    "for instance , while every dog has a measured 24@xmath0 m flux density , very few have been observed at 350@xmath0 m , and only two have been observed at 1 mm .",
    "similarly , few xfls and swire sources have been detected at 1 mm and even fewer have been observed at 350@xmath0 m . although smgs are the best - studied class of objects within this set of populations , they too suffer from low - number statistics .",
    "larger sample sizes in the critical 200 - 500@xmath0 m regime will arrive following the analysis of wide - field survey data from the balloon - borne large aperture submillimeter telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the _ herschel _ space observatory .",
    "one of the major open questions in galaxy evolution is the effect that agn have on their host galaxies . in the local universe",
    ", there is observational evidence that ulirgs dominated by warm dust serve as a transition phase between cold dust ulirgs and optically luminous quasars and that this transition may be driven by a major merger @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical models of quasar evolution based on numerical simulations of major mergers between gas - rich spirals have suggested that the subsequent growth of a super - massive black hole can regulate star - formation via a feedback effect which re - injects energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and expels the remaining gas that would otherwise form stars @xcite .",
    "although the notion that local ulirgs are associated with mergers is well accepted , the picture is less clear at high redshift .",
    "morphological studies of high-@xmath190 galaxies suffer from surface brightness dimming , making the detection of faint merger remnant signatures difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however recent theoretical work on the cosmological role of mergers in the formation of quasars and spheroid galaxies suggests that they dominate the @xmath221 quasar luminosity density compared to secular processes such as bars or disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "if major mergers drive the formation of massive galaxies at high redshift , then one possible interpretation of our results involves an evolutionary scenario in which these sources represent a very brief but luminous episode of extreme agn growth just prior to the quenching of star formation .",
    "in such a scenario , smgs and the brightest 24@xmath0m - selected sources represent the beginning and end stages , respectively , of the high star - formation rate , high ir luminosity phase in massive galaxy evolution .",
    "consistent with this scenario is that we find 24@xmath0m - bright dogs in botes to have higher dust temperatures ( possibly from agn heating of the dust ) than smgs and less extreme _ spitzer_-selected sources .",
    "we caution , however , that these results are consistent with any evolutionary model in which the 24@xmath0m - bright phase follows the sub - mm bright phase , be it driven by major mergers , minor mergers , or some secular process .",
    "finally , we stress that larger samples of mm and sub - mm imaging of _ spitzer_-selected galaxies are needed in order to understand their role in galaxy evolution fully by comparing samples of similar number density , clustering properties , etc .",
    "much of this will be provided by upcoming _",
    "herschel _ and scuba-2 surveys . in the more immediate future ,",
    "1 mm imaging with currently available instruments such as the astronomical thermal emission camera ( aztec ) and the max - planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) will be critical to constraining the cold dust properties of _ spitzer_-selected galaxies .",
    "only when these surveys have obtained statistically significant numbers of detections or stringent upper limits will we be able to make definitive conclusions regarding the nature of the link between agn and starbursts in the formation of the most massive galaxies .",
    "we present cso / sharc - ii 350@xmath0 m and carma 1 mm photometry of dogs in the botes field .",
    "the major results and conclusions from this study are the following :    1 .   at 350@xmath0 m",
    ", 4/5 dogs are detected in data with low rms levels ( @xmath222mjy ) and 0/8 dogs are detected in data with medium to high rms levels ( @xmath223mjy ) . at 1 mm ,",
    "a subset of two dogs were observed but not detected .",
    "mrk  231 is confirmed as a valid template for the seds of the dogs in this sample .",
    "this suggests the 24@xmath0 m bright ( @xmath224  mjy ) population of dogs is dominated by warm dust , possibly heated by an agn .",
    "cold dust templates such as arp  220 are inconsistent with the data in all twelve objects studied .",
    "3 .   trends in the flux density ratios 350@xmath0m/24@xmath0 m and 1200@xmath0m/24@xmath0 m with the @xmath11-[24 ] color ( @xmath225 ) show that dogs in this sample have elevated 24@xmath0 m emission relative to smgs , most likely due to an obscured agn .",
    "the non - detections at 1 mm imply @xmath111 greater than 35 - 60  k for two objects .",
    "if the dust properties of the two dogs observed at 1 mm apply generally to the 24@xmath0 m bright dogs , then we estimate dust masses for these sources of @xmath226 .",
    "lower @xmath111 would imply higher dust masses and vice versa .",
    "6 .   in comparison to other @xmath18 ulirgs ,",
    "dogs have warmer dust temperatures that imply higher ir luminosities and lower dust masses .",
    "this may be an indication that agn growth has heated the ambient ism in these sources .",
    "our stellar mass estimates provide weak evidence indicating that the 24@xmath0m - bright dogs may have converted more gas into stars than smgs or other _ spitzer_-selected sources , consistent with them representing a subsequent phase of evolution .",
    "an important caveat to this conclusion is that we have assumed dogs and smgs share the same gas mass to dust mass ratio .",
    "testing this assumption will require new data and will be an important goal of future work .",
