    "vibrational modes and , more generally , collective degrees of freedom have been a recurring theme in nuclear structure studies over many decades .",
    "an especially interesting topic that has recently attracted considerable interest is the multipole response of nuclei far from stability and the possible occurrence of exotic modes of excitation @xcite . for theoretical studies of collective vibrations in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei",
    "the tool of choice is the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , or quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) for open - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "the ( q)rpa equations can be obtained by linearizing the time - dependent hartree - fock ( bogoliubov ) equations , and the standard method of solution presents a generalized eigenvalue problem for the ( q)rpa matrix . as the space of quasiparticle excitations can become very large in open - shell heavy nuclei , the standard matrix solution of the qrpa equations is often computationally prohibitive , especially for deformed nuclei .",
    "in addition to the fact that a very large number of matrix elements has to be computed , the calculation of each matrix elements is complicated by the fact that most modern implementations of the ( q)rpa are fully self - consistent , that is , the residual interaction is obtained as a second functional derivative of the nuclear energy density functional with respect to the nucleonic one - body density . since energy density functionals can be quite complicated and include many terms @xcite , this produces complex residual interactions and the computation of huge ( q)rpa matrices becomes excessively time - consuming .",
    "although several new implementations of the fully self - consistent matrix qrpa for axially deformed nuclei have been developed in recent years @xcite , and even applied to studies of collective modes in rather heavy deformed nuclei , the huge computational cost has so far prevented systematic studies of multipole response in deformed nuclei .",
    "an interesting and very useful alternative solution of the ( q)rpa problem has recently been proposed , based on the finite - amplitude method ( fam ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "one avoids the computation and diagonalization of the ( q)rpa matrix by calculating , instead , the fields induced by the external one - body operator and iteratively solving the corresponding linear response problem .",
    "the fam for the rpa has very successfully been employed in a self - consistent calculation of nuclear photo absorption cross sections @xcite , and in a study of the emergence of pygmy dipole resonances in nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "more recently the fam has been extended to the quasiparticle rpa based on the skyrme hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework @xcite .",

    "we report a new implementation of the fam for the relativistic quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( rqrpa ) , based on the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model for mean - field studies of deformed open - shell nuclei @xcite .",

    "we have implemented a recently proposed efficient method for the iterative solution of the fam ",
    "qrpa equations in the framework of relativistic energy density functionals .",

    ", the fam - rqrpa model has been applied to an analysis of the splitting of the giant monopole resonance in deformed nuclei . in particular , we have investigated the evolution of the @xmath85 strength in the chain of samarium isotopes , from the proton - rich @xmath86sm , to systems with considerable neutron excess close to @xmath87sm . to study the splitting of the monopole strength in more detail , we have performed a deformation - constrained fam - rqrpa calculation for the nucleus @xmath102sm .",
    "a significant mixing of the monopole and quadrupole modes has been found for both the low - energy and high - energy components of the @xmath85 strength , consistent with the standard interpretation of the splitting of monopole strength in deformed nuclei .",
    "the advantage of developing and employing the fam - rqrpa formalism would , of course , be limited unless it is extended to higher multipoles .",
    "this development is already in progress .",
    "another important extension of the fam - rqrpa model is the one to the charge - exchange channel .",
    "the fam for the charge - exchange rqrpa will enable the description and modeling of a variety of astrophysically relevant weak - interaction processes , in particular beta - decay , electron capture , and neutrino reactions in deformed nuclei .",
    "since many isotopes that are crucial for the process of nucleosynthesis display considerable deformation , a reliable modeling of elemental abundances necessitates a microscopic and self - consistent description of underlying transitions and weak - interaction processes , and this can be attained using the charge - exchange extension of the framework introduced in this work .",
