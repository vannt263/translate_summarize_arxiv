    "since the large hadron collider ( lhc ) started its run , many experimental results have come out that have provided an opportunity to carry out further investigation of the phenomenology of qcd - based effective theories .",
    "nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) is one of the most successful effective theories describing quarkonium production and decays  @xcite . under the nrqcd framework ,",
    "the cross section is factorized into the summation of the products of the short - distance coefficient ( sdc ) , which is independent of the quarkonium state and can be calculated perturbatively , and the long - distance matrix element ( ldme ) , which only depends on the quarkonium state and requires the fit of experimental data to extract its value .",
    "the cross section for the process of heavy quarkonium @xmath2 production or decay can be expressed as d(h)=_ndf_no^h(n)[eqn : nrqcd ] where @xmath3 is the sdc for the @xmath4 state @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the ldme of state @xmath5 for quarkonium @xmath2 .",
    "nrqcd succeeded in many processes where the color - singlet ( cs ) model  @xcite failed ; however , it still faces many challenges .",
    "@xmath7 polarization at hadron colliders is among the most puzzling questions that nrqcd encounters .",
    "references  @xcite investigated the polarization of directly produced @xmath7 , while ref .  @xcite provided polarization results for prompt @xmath7 hadroproduction , which is the first next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) result comparable with experiment .",
    "the three letters employed three sets of ldmes , which were obtained from different fit strategies .",
    "all of them can describe @xmath7 production , yet none of them can explain all the polarization measurements .",
    "in addition , the universality of the ldmes is another challenge .",
    "reference  @xcite reconciled experimental data of @xmath7 production at the tevatron and hera;however , their ldmes resulted in unphysical cross sections when employed to @xmath7 associated with a photon production at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is the transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) integrated cross sections for the @xmath7 hadroproduction .",
    "the theoretical results at qcd nlo obtained with collinear factorization  @xcite overshoot the experimental data .",
    "having resummed @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 denotes the bjorken-@xmath10 ) and considered the all - twist contributions in the dense side , ma and venugopalan  @xcite remedied the discrepancy .",
    "however , they  @xcite did not include the @xmath0 and @xmath11 feeddown contributions .",
    "whether the inclusion of these parts will ruin the conclusions requires further investigation . actually , ref .",
    "@xcite has already studied the @xmath0 production processes in which the @xmath8 of the @xmath0 completely comes from the initial states . exploiting the unintegrated gluon distribution , the authors announced that the color - octet ( co ) ldme for @xmath0 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained through the collinear factorization calculations .",
    "reference  @xcite , however , found that the final - state gluon emission processes actually dominate the @xmath0 hadroproduction in the midrapidity region .",
    "for the above reasons , testing nrqcd is still an important work .",
    "p - wave quarkonia productions provide an excellent laboratory to test nrqcd .",
    "above all , at lo in @xmath12 ( the typical relative velocity of quark and antiquark in quarkonium ) , only one ldme is to be obtained from experiment ; one does not suffer from the entanglement of too many free parameters in the fit of experimental data , in contrast to the @xmath7 case  @xcite .",
    "further , at nlo , the @xmath8 distribution of both @xmath13}$ ] and @xmath14}$ ] channels behaves as @xmath15 in the large @xmath8 region .",
    "higher order corrections can not exceed this behavior ; thus , one can expect nlo predictions to give a good precision in this phase space region .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath16}$ ] case , the significance of nnlo correction is still in the mist .",
    "finally , feeddown from higher excited states to p - wave quarkonia , say , @xmath0 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 , can almost be neglected [ e.g.,@xmath20 at lhcb  @xcite ] .",
    "notice the advantages stated above : we say the case of @xmath0 is  clean \" ; it is much easier to make definite conclusions in this case than in the @xmath7 case .",
    "on the other hand , the study of @xmath0 production is not only important itself for phenomenological concerns , but also provides an opportunity for precise study of @xmath7 phenomenology ( e.g.,ref .",

    "et al_.  @xcite provided a detailed study on the polarization of hadroproduced @xmath0 and @xmath0-generated @xmath7 ; at the same time , they compared the theoretical prediction with some of the recent experimental data  @xcite .",
    "et al_.  @xcite calculated @xmath0 hadroproduction at lo in @xmath22 and extracted both the cs and co ldmes from the fit of the experimental data , where their cs ldme is several times larger than the value obtained by the potential model and higher order terms in @xmath23 contribute significantly .",
    "this paper is devoted to the theoretical predictions of @xmath0 hadroproduction , for one thing , as an alternative test of nrqcd .",
    "recently , a number of experiment results have come out from the lhc collaborations , among which are many measurements on the @xmath0 yield and the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "this paper will answer the question whether a single ldme can explain all the experimental data .",
    "for another thing , the popular values of the ldmes for @xmath0 production , both at lo and nlo , were all given before these experimental results were published ; they are out of date . this paper will provide a detailed analysis on the determination of the ldmes and reasonable values of it at both lo and nlo . finally , as suggested in ref .",

    "the left- and right - hand side of eq.([eqn : fac ] ) should keep those terms up to the same order as in the perturbative expansion .",

    "in this paper , we calculated @xmath0 production cross sections and the ratio @xmath1 at hadron colliders , and compared the theoretical predictions with the experiment .",
    "we presented a detailed analysis on the co ldmes and found that , at lo , there does not exist any universal value of the co ldme to explain all the experiments , while at nlo , the co ldme obtained from a global fit is able to explain all the experimental data . at lo",
    ", we obtained the value of @xmath72 ranging from 0.13 to 1.26 when fitting individual experiments e1@xmath51e6 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of @xmath72 result in quite a large band , which can cover most of the experimental data ; however , the upper bound overestimates the significance of @xmath0 feeddown contributions for some of the experimental conditions . as for the nlo case , we carried out a global fit by using eight schemes .",
    "each of them agree well with the experimental data .",
    "we also investigated the @xmath39 dependence of the results and found that , for e1 , e4@xmath51e6 , and the small @xmath8 region in e2 and e3 , the dependence on @xmath39 can be absorbed into the ldmes , while for the large @xmath8 region in e2 and e3 , the problem of @xmath39 dependence is relatively severe .",
    "one needs to resum the large log terms rising from large rapidity to achieve better results .",
