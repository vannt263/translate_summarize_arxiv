    "calculation of the @xmath0 decay amplitudes is very important to quantitatively understand the @xmath1 rule in the decay of the neutral @xmath16 meson system and to theoretically predict the direct @xmath17 violation parameter ( @xmath18 ) from the standard model .",
    "a direct lattice qcd calculation of the decay amplitudes for the @xmath19 process has been attempted for a long time .",
    "recently , the rbc - ukqcd collaboration presented the results at the physical quark mass in ref .",
    "@xcite , and those in the continuum limit in ref .",
    "@xcite in the physical kinematics , where the pions in the final state have finite momenta .",
    "they used the domain wall fermion action which preserves chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "a direct calculation of the decay amplitudes for the @xmath1 process has been unsuccessful for a long time , due to large statistical fluctuations from the disconnected diagrams .",
    "a first direct calculation was reported by the rbc - ukqcd collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite at a lattice spacing @xmath20 and a pion mass @xmath21 on a @xmath22 lattice with the domain wall fermion action .",
    "they also presented a result at a smaller quark mass ( @xmath23 ) on a @xmath24 lattice with the same fermion action at lattice 2011  @xcite .",
    "in these two calculations , the kinematics was a @xmath16 meson at rest decaying to two zero momentum pions at an unphysical quark mass satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "the rbc - ukqcd collaboration has since been attempting a direct calculation in the physical kinematics at the physical quark mass by utilizing @xmath25-parity boundary conditions .",
    "their preliminary result was reported at lattice 2014  @xcite .",
    "an aim of the present article is to report on our calculation of the @xmath0 decay amplitudes with the improved wilson fermion action for both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes . that such a calculation is feasible stems from a realization , as shown in the present article , that cps symmetry  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite ensure that mixings with four - fermion operators with wrong chirality are absent even for the wilson fermion action for the parity odd process in both channels .",
    "a mixing to a lower dimension operator does occur , which gives unphysical contributions to the amplitudes on the lattice .",
    "however , it can be nonperturbatively subtracted by imposing a renormalization condition  @xcite .",
    "after the subtraction we can obtain the physical decay amplitudes by the renormalization factor having the same structure as for the chiral symmetry preserved case .",
    "a potential advantage with the wilson fermion action over chirally symmetric lattice actions such as the domain wall action is that the computational cost is generally smaller .",
    "hence , with the same amount of computational resources , a statistical improvement may be expected with the lattice calculation of the decay amplitudes , albeit this point has to be verified by actual calculations .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the decay of @xmath16 meson to two zero momentum pions at an unphysical quark mass @xmath3 , as in refs .",

    "our calculations are carried out on a subset of gauge configurations previously generated by the pacs - cs collaboration with the iwasaki gauge action and the nonperturbatively @xmath5-improved wilson fermion action for @xmath4 flavors at @xmath26 on a @xmath9 lattice  @xcite .",
    "the subset corresponds to the hopping parameters @xmath27 for the up and the down quark and @xmath28 for the strange quark .",

    "however , these relations are not valid .",
    "therefore , if we adopt the dimensional regularization for regularization , we should deal with all operators @xmath56 for @xmath43 as independent .",
    "the matrix elements calculated on the lattice are converted to those in the continuum by the renormalization factor for the operators . in this section",
    "we discuss the renormalization factor in the case of the wilson fermion action .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : continuum ] , the 10 four - fermion operators @xmath57 are not independent , and they may be arranged into 7 linearly independent combinations according to the irreducible representation of the flavor @xmath58 symmetry group .",
    "the 7 operators consist of @xmath59 , whose components are given by @xmath60 the operators @xmath61 are the @xmath62 type four - fermion operators and @xmath63 are of @xmath64 type .    if the chiral symmetry is preserved in the regularization , mixings between operators in different representations are forbidden . for the wilson fermion action ,",
    "however , chiral symmetry is broken to the vector subgroup , @xmath65 .",
    "hence mixings among different representations is in general allowed , and new operators arise through radiative corrections .",
    "however , we show below that such a problem is absent for the parity odd part of the operators in the list of ( [ eq : weak_op1])([eq : weak_op10 ] ) or of ( [ eq : chiral_rep1])([eq : chiral_rep3 ] ) for the wilson fermion action employed in the present work .    to investigate the operator mixing , we exploit the full set of unbroken symmetries for the wilson fermion action , namely flavor @xmath66 , parity @xmath67 , charge conjugation @xmath68 , and @xmath69 which is the symmetry under @xmath17 transformation followed by the exchange of the @xmath70 and the @xmath71 quarks .",

    ". therefore we have to consider mixings including these operators .",
    "let us discuss the problem in two steps , first considering mixings through diagrams in which gluons are exchanged between quarks of the four - fermion operators ( gluon exchange diagrams ) , and second through penguin diagrams in which a pair of quarks from the four - fermion operators forms a quark loop .",
    "for the first type of mixings , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the parity odd part of the @xmath62 and @xmath64 type operators , and the @xmath77 type operator do not mix with each other .",

    "we see that a cancellation of the quark loops at the weak operator occurs between the @xmath70 quark and the @xmath71 quark contributions .",
    "we can see this cancellation also in the operator @xmath109 .    since this cancellation means that the renormalization factor coming from the penguin diagram is proportional to the quark mass difference @xmath110 , mixings to four - fermion operators",
    "are absent due to the dimensional reason .",
    "in addition , the operator arising from the penguin diagrams should have the flavor structure @xmath111 , which is different from that of @xmath112 .",
    "thus , operator mixings from @xmath94 to the other representations and their reverse are absent .",
    "these statements also hold for @xmath87 in ( [ eq : op_2a])([eq : op_2b ] ) for the same reason , and the operators @xmath87 are fully isolated in the theory . further mixing between the @xmath92 and @xmath93 representations in the penguin diagrams",
    "is forbidden by the flavor @xmath66 symmetry .",
    "this concludes the proof on the absence of unwanted mixings among the parity - odd part of dimension 6 operators .    up to now",
    ", we have shown that the matrix of the renormalization factor for the parity odd part of the four - fermion operators in ( [ eq : chiral_rep1])([eq : chiral_rep3 ] ) have the same structure as that in the chiral symmetry preserved case . here",
    "we consider the mixing to lower dimensional operators . from @xmath69 symmetry and the equation of motion of the quark ,",
    "there is only one operator with the dimension less than 6 , which is @xmath113 this operator also appears in the continuum , but does not yield a nonvanishing contribution to the physical decay amplitudes , since it is a total derivative operator .",
    "however , this is not valid for the wilson fermion action due to chiral symmetry breaking by the wilson term , and the operator ( [ eq : q_p ] ) does give a nonzero unphysical contribution to the amplitudes on the lattice .",
    "this contribution should be subtracted nonperturbatively , because the mixing coefficient includes a power divergence due to the lattice cutoff growing as @xmath114 . in the present work ,",
    "we subtract it by imposing the following condition  @xcite , @xmath115 for each operator @xmath57 in ( [ eq : weak_op1])([eq : weak_op5 ] ) .",
    "the matrix of the renormalization factor of the subtracted operators @xmath116 has the same structure as in the chiral symmetry preserved case .    here",
    ", we mention an ambiguity in the subtraction procedure . instead of strictly demanding the subtraction condition ( [ eq : sub_q ] ) , we can choose a different subtracted operator , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is a finite constant depending on the quark masses .",
    "the constants do not include the power divergence , and they vanish in the chiral limit . in general , such a finite ambiguity seems to remain in the final results of the decay amplitude for finite quark masses , as pointed out in ref .",
    "our case , however , is not a such case for the following reason .",
    "the operator @xmath119 can be written as @xmath120 from the relation of the partially conserved axial vector current for the wilson fermion action , where @xmath121 is the renormalized axial vector current and @xmath122 is the dimension 5 operator whose matrix element vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "thus , a @xmath123 term yields a contribution of form @xmath124 to the decay amplitude with finite constants @xmath68 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the momentum difference between the initial and the final state .",
    "these contributions do not include any power divergent parts .",
    "thus , by taking @xmath127 and the continuum limit , we can safely estimate the physical value of the decay amplitudes without suffering from the ambiguity .",
