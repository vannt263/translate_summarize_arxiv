    "<S> the properties of single - crystal srtio@xmath0 substrates and homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 films grown by pulsed laser deposition have been compared , in order to understand the loss of interfacial conductivity when more than a critical thickness of nominally homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 is inserted between a laalo@xmath0 film and a srtio@xmath0 substrate . in particular , the chemical composition and the structure of homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 investigated by low - energy ion - scattering and surface x - ray diffraction , </S>",
    "<S> show that for insulating heterointerfaces , a sr - excess is present between the laalo@xmath0 and homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an increase in the out - of - plane lattice constant is observed in laalo@xmath0 , indicating that the conductivity both with and without insertion of srtio@xmath0 thin film originates from a zener breakdown associated with the polar catastrophe . when more than a critical thickness of homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 is inserted between laalo@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the electrons transferred by the electronic reconstruction are trapped by the formation of a sr - rich secondary phase and sr - vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the migration of sr towards the surface of homoepitaxial sto and accompanying loss of interfacial conductivity can be delayed by reducing the sr - content in the pld target .    </S>",
    "<S> complex - oxide - heterostructures have been the subject of intense research in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example is the interface between laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto )  despite both components being band insulators , a two - dimensional electron system is created at their interface @xcite after deposition of a critical lao thickness of four monolayers ( mls ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phenomena such as magnetoresistance oscillations @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , carrier density tunability @xcite , and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) writing @xcite make this system technologically interesting for future integrated oxide - based electronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> however , extensions of this phenomenon crucial to future applications , in particular its observation on other substrate types and the successful fabrication of multilayer lao / sto containing multiple conducting layers , appear to be thwarted by material issues @xcite , mostly regarding interface quality  related structures such as lao on homoepitaxial sto ( h - sto ) , lao on a sto buffer layer to other substrate types , and lao / sto superlattices , have been grown under a wide variety of growth and annealing conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large variation in the reported electronic properties is indicative of how sensitive this system is to growth parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it was reported that the interfacial carrier density of heterostructures of @xmath2  ml lao on @xmath3  ml h - sto ( @xmath4 ) decrease with increasing @xmath3 @xcite , raising questions on the properties of ultrathin h - sto films compared to single - crystal sto substrates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , understanding the electronic properties of samples grown on buffer h - sto is key towards successful fabrication of superlattices with multiple conducting interfaces .    in the case of sto single crystals , local deviations from the expected surface chemistry of tio@xmath5-terminated sto </S>",
    "<S> were found to be induced by sr - migration towards the surface @xcite or desorption of titanium @xcite , depending on the processing parameters , while other phase- and structural changes have also been observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , global off - stoichiometry and formation of oxygen and cations vacancies can occur as a result of noncongruent transfer from the pld target to the growing film @xcite .    in the following , we report on the investigation of the change in interfacial properties when lao is separated from the bulk substrate by an ultrathin layer of h - sto , and why </S>",
    "<S> , when more than a critical thickness of h - sto is grown , the conductivity disappears entirely . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy ion - scattering ( leis ) was used to study the near - surface chemical of h - sto and to show that a sr - excess builds up with increasing h - sto thickness . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the out - of - plane lattice parameter of lao with h - sto thickness was observed by surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) , confirming charge transfer across the interface @xcite , independent of the h - sto thickness . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed , however , that above the critical h - sto thickness , these itinerant electrons become trapped in the increasing number of vacancies formed in the h - sto layer . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that this defect density can be reduced by changing the stoichiometry of the sto pld target , thereby increasing the critical h - sto thickness </S>",
    "<S> .    bilayers of lao on h - sto were grown by pld on tio@xmath5-terminated sto substrates ( miscut @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the substrates were heated to @xmath7c and growth of both h - sto and lao films was performed at an oxygen pressure of @xmath8  mbar , a laser fluence of @xmath9  j@xmath10@xmath11 , and repetition rate of @xmath12  hz . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate was monitored by reflection high - energy electron - diffraction [ rheed , see e.g. , fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure1](a ) for the growth of @xmath13  ml h - sto ] . </S>",
    "<S> the deposition was paused after each ml of h - sto for @xmath14  s in order to allow the surface to relax ( observed by a levelling out in the rheed intensity ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after growth , the temperature was decreased to @xmath15c and the films were post - annealed for @xmath12  hour in @xmath16  mbar o@xmath17 in order to remove oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> two pld targets were used for the h - sto growth : a stoichiometric sto single crystal , referred to henceforth as the `` standard '' target ; and a @xmath13  %  sr - deficient polycrystalline target ( sr@xmath18tio@xmath19 , density @xmath20  % ) . the spotty 2-d rheed pattern , including kikuchi lines , after h - sto growth </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure1](b ) shows atomically flat terraces . </S>",
    "<S> the h - sto layers were studied by leis at the department of materials , imperial college , london . </S>",
    "<S> prior to measurement , the samples were cleaned with ethanol , acetone and millipore water , and then _ in - situ _ by an oxygen atomic plasma for @xmath22  minutes . </S>",
    "<S> leis was performed using @xmath13  kev @xmath23he@xmath24 ions . </S>",
    "<S> etching for depth - profiling was achieved using @xmath9-kev @xmath25ar@xmath24 ions . </S>",

    "<S> resistance versus temperature of heterostructures grown with ( b ) the `` standard '' sto target , and ( c ) the sr - deficient sto target.,width=340 ]        conductivity measurements revealed that all heterostructures with either @xmath27  ml `` standard '' h - sto or @xmath28  ml sr - deficient h - sto are insulating ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance of both types of interface versus h - sto thickness is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conducting samples have sheet resistances in a similar range as that for standard lao on sto @xcite . indeed , this excellent agreement is a strong argument that there is no significant contribution from oxygen vacancies in the h - sto films . </S>",
    "<S> all interfaces with less than @xmath30  ml lao are insulating . the interfacial resistance measured as a function of temperature shows an upturn with increasing h - sto thickness for both types of target stoichiometries [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](b ) and ( c ) ] , explained by charge localization ( i.e. , freezing of the carriers ) due to point defects in the h - sto . for the films grown using the sr - deficient target , this upturn appears at a larger h - sto film thickness , indicating that a decrease in the target s strontium content delays the formation of defects during the pld growth process . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the issue of which type of defect leads to this behaviour .    under our growth conditions </S>",
    "<S> , cation - vacancy formation is more likely than oxygen vacancies @xcite , because , on the one hand , the films are post - annealed in oxygen , and , on the other , nonstoichiometric ablation of the target can occur . </S>",
    "<S> first - principle calculations from tanaka _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite indicate that sr - vacancy formation is energetically favored over ti - vacancy formation . </S>",
    "<S> this begs the question of where the sr - species relocate after producing the vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation involving sr has already been reported in the literature both in thin films and single crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two main mechanisms were proposed for the formation of sr - vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , partial sr - schottky defects can be formed in the film , thereby creating oxygen- and sr - vacancies , whereby the o and sr create ordered superlattices of ruddlesden - popper structures ( @xmath31 @xcite , as experimentally observed in sr - rich h - sto thin films @xcite : @xmath32 whereby v@xmath33 is a sr - vacancy and v@xmath34 is an o - vacancy , according to the formalism of krger and vink @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , sr and o can react to form a separate sr - rich phase specifically at the surface of h - sto , leaving doubly charged sr - vacancies @xcite : @xmath35 whereby v@xmath33 is a doubly charged sr - vacancy and sro@xmath36 is the secondary phase .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] it is shown that the h - sto thickness threshold to suppress conductivity can be tuned by decreasing the sr - content in the pld target . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the film stoichiometry influences the electron - transfer process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , both of the above explanations for the accumulation of defects involve a second - phase formation . </S>",
    "<S> leis measurements were therefore performed in order to investigate the h - sto stoichiometry . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is highly surface sensitive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stoichiometry depth profiles of different films were thus accurately determined by leis combined with controlled etching .    </S>",
    "<S> the leis / depth profiling results are summarized in fig .  [ fig : figure3](a ) for several `` standard '' h - sto films , plus bare substrates for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the sr / ti ratio increases in the near - surface region of approximately the first one to two monolayers for films thicker than @xmath13  ml </S>",
    "<S> . however , below the critical thickness of @xmath37  ml , the sr / ti ratio of the h - sto is the same as the bulk ratio to within @xmath38  % . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of the top region with altered stoichiometry shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](b ) increases slightly with h - sto film thickness after the initial threshold at @xmath13  ml and becomes constant at approximately @xmath39  nm for h - sto thicknesses above @xmath21  ml . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the initial sr / ti ratio at the surface was investigated [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](c ) ] for the h - sto films , plus mixed - terminated and tio@xmath5-terminated sto single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the sr / ti ratio for the latter is around @xmath9 , which compares well with the ratio found at the surface of all the h - sto films , from which we can conclude that they maintain the tio@xmath5-termination after growth , at least for the range of thicknesses studied . </S>",
    "<S> the sr / ti ratio across `` standard '' h - sto films is compared with that of sr - deficient h - sto films with thicknesses below and larger than the critical thickness in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](d ) and ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the films thinner than the critical thickness derived from the conductivity measurements ( @xmath37  ml `` standard '' h - sto and @xmath21  ml sr - deficient h - sto ) exhibit very limited sr - excess at the surface . by increasing the number of deposited layers , the sr - excess builds up at the surface of both `` standard '' and sr - deficient sto . </S>",
    "<S> this result proves that the sr - migration is delayed by decreasing the sr - content in the pld target , similar to results obtained by jung _ </S>",

    "<S> ml h - sto grown with the `` standard '' target in violet and sr - deficient target in green , ( right ) : @xmath21  ml lao on top of h - sto grown with the `` standard '' and sr - deficient targets , as a function of @xmath40 in sto reciprocal lattice units [ r.l.u.].,width=226 ]    the strong correlation between fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](a ) and figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) suggests that the onset of insulating behaviour of the interface is related to the sr - rich layer . to explain a mechanism responsible for the loss of conductivity after a given h - sto thickness </S>",
    "<S> , the origin of the conductivity in samples with thinner h - sto interlayers needs to be known . </S>",
    "<S> because the onset of conductivity as a function of lao thickness is identical in both the standard lao / sto system and the lao / h - sto / sto systems , it seems probable that the polar catastrophe is also responsible for conductivity at interfaces involving h - sto @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a signature of the intrinsic polar - catastrophe mechanism is a dilation of the lao out - of - plane lattice parameter , due to one or both phenomena of the increased ionic radius of trivalent titanium associated with interfacial intermixing @xcite and electrostriction in films in which the electric field is still present @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sxrd measurements were performed in order to extract the out - of - plane lattice parameter of the lao films . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the film peak position allows an accurate determination of the lattice parameter of lao , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure4](a ) for heterostructures both with and without the h - sto interlayer . samples with @xmath13  ml lao exhibit , as expected , a larger out - of - plane lattice parameter of @xmath41   . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the lattice parameter decreases to @xmath42    for heterostructures with lao thicknesses greater or equal to @xmath30  ml . from these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the increase of the lattice parameter in lao remains when h - sto is inserted between lao and the sto substrate @xcite and that the polar catastrophe is responsible for the formation of the interfacial electron gas .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , samples with a sufficient h - sto thickness to induce an insulating interface show a similar change in the out - of - plane lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the zener breakdown occurs , but the transferred electrons are trapped . </S>",
    "<S> bulk conductivity in sto is known to be affected by extrinsic and intrinsic doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic self - dopants under our growth / annealing conditions are far more likely to be acceptor - type sr - vacancies than donor - type oxygen vacancies . therefore , the loss of conductivity after a critical h - sto thickness would imply that the number of sr - vacancies becomes sufficient to trap the transferred electrons , and would also explain the fairly gradual loss of conductivity with h - sto thickness . by trapping the electrons in sr - vacancies , an ionic self - compensation mechanism </S>",
    "<S> @xcite takes place . </S>",
    "<S> a similar example of carrier deactivation in doped sto has already been reported when electrons supplied by extrinsic nb - dopants are compensated by sr - vacancies introduced during growth @xcite .    the increase in the critical h - sto thickness needed to suppress conductivity when using a sr - deficient pld target can be explained by the well - known problem of noncongruent transfer in pld @xcite . if a stoichiometric sto target produces sr - rich layers , then presumably marginally lowering the sr - content of the target will compensate this to an extent . indeed , this change in the electron density is visible from the laue fringes in the specular ctrs of @xmath21  ml of h - sto grown with the `` standard '' and sr - deficient targets [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure4](b ) ] , which are significantly more pronounced in the `` standard '' sample . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the sr - content can only be decreased by a few percent before separate sto and tio@xmath17 phases are visible in the diffraction pattern .    in conclusion , we have found that the interface between lao and h - sto becomes insulating when h - sto exceeds a given critical thickness , which depends on the sr - content of the pld target and subsequent segregation of sr to the top of the h - sto layer . for h - sto films close to the critical thickness </S>",
    "<S> , the sr - rich layer region coincides with an upturn in conductivity at low temperature , due to defects in the interface between lao and h - sto . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous formation of sr - vacancies and a sr - rich secondary phase is predicted by theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sxrd measurements of the lao out - of - plane lattice parameters of lao on h - sto heterostructures support the polar - catastrophe scenario as the origin of the conductivity for interfaces grown on h - sto . </S>",
    "<S> an ionic self - compensation mechanism , in which electrons are trapped in acceptor - type sr - vacancies , explains the loss of conductivity above a critical number of these defects , which is delayed to thicker h - sto thicknesses in films grown using a sr - deficient pld target . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides a new insight into the non - conducting behaviour observed when lao is grown on h - sto and provides a basis for future works on superlattices with multiple conducting interfaces . </S>"
