    "soft x - ray resonant inelastic scattering ( rixs ) is increasingly important in the study of electronic properties of strongly correlated @xmath2 systems.@xcite measurements of @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations that correspond to local rearrangements of @xmath2 electrons provide a valuable piece of information on the strong coupling between spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in a system .",
    "last years , the advances achieved on the instrumental side of rixs make it possible to measure electronic excitations with energy resolution better that 0.1ev and , hence , to resolve fine features of electronic structure not accessible previously .",
    "the family of vanadium oxides rvo@xmath5 ( with r = y or trivalent rare earth ion ) with @xmath3 configuration of v@xmath6 ions have attracted much attention because of its rich and complex behavior.@xcite in these mott - hubbard insulating materials with a weak deviation from the ideal cubic perovskite structure the anticipated crystal - field ( cf ) splitting of @xmath7 orbitals is rather small @xmath8ev and varies with structural changes . in these circumstances , to describe the low - energy properties of rvo@xmath5 the orbital and spin degrees of freedom have to be treated on equal footing , which leads to a spin - orbital superexchange lattice model derived and studied in a series of papers.@xcite the model was shown to predict diverse behavior of the system in dependence on the model parameter chosen and complementary theoretical assumptions made .",
    "one of the basic assumptions concerns the choice of a point symmetry at v ion , the cf parameters and their variation along the rvo@xmath5 series irrespective of any orbital and spin ordering .",
    "we note that cf splitting of @xmath7 orbitals and the multiplet structure of @xmath3 configuration of v ion can be directly inferred from the low - energy part of high - resolution rixs spectra provided the spectral features associated with @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations are properly identified as bound excitonic states , i.e. , the low - energy in - gap electronic excitations produced by rixs at the final stage in an insulating strongly correlated system .    in the present study , we examine theoretically the spectrum of @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations with special attention to a spin and orbital disordered phase of rvo@xmath5 . in sec.ii , we begin with a brief description of several basic properties of nearly cubic vanadium perovskites , including the calculated electronic multiplet structure of the v@xmath6 ion related to the expected rixs spectra",
    ". fundamentals of the vanadium @xmath1-edge ( 2@xmath9 - 3@xmath0 core - hole excitation ) rixs transitions are discussed in sec.iii .",
    "since a comprehensive analysis of relevant rixs transitions requires knowledge of intermediate core - hole states , this item is considered in sec.iv in many detail .",
    "a generic procedure for calculating the rixs transition amplitudes together with a more detailed consideration of the lowest - energy @xmath0-@xmath0 excitation are present in sec.v .",
    "summary , conclusions , and outlook follow in sec.vi .",
    "at room temperature the crystal lattice of rvo@xmath5 is described by an orthorhombic space group with the lattice constants @xmath10 .",
    "a relatively weak deviation from the ideal cubic structure is caused by a regular rotation , tilting and distortion of vo@xmath11 octahedra . as a result",
    ", the cubic degeneracy of @xmath7 orbitals occupied by two electrons is removed and the accordingly weak cf splitting of @xmath8ev is expected , which is controlled by a variation of the r - site ionic radius @xmath12 along the rvo@xmath5 series .",
    "interplay between weakly split @xmath7 orbitals , spins and lattice degrees of freedom is in the hart of a rich behavior observed in rvo@xmath5 family , including two types of the orbital - ordering ( oo ) and spin - ordering ( so ) patterns observed and reported in a number of works , as for instance , reviewed shortly in ref .. an ordering , called the @xmath13-oo , corresponds to the orbital arrangement of antiferro - type in @xmath14plane and ferro - type along the @xmath15axis .",
    "the @xmath13-oo together with the antiferromagnetic @xmath16-type spin ordering ( @xmath16-so , with spins staggered in all three directions ) occur at low temperatures , @xmath17100k , in rvo@xmath5 with smallest @xmath12 .",
    "the other ordering pattern is the @xmath16-oo accompanied with @xmath13-so and observed at intermediate temperatures .",
    "the @xmath16-oo/@xmath13-so is the only ordered phase in rvo@xmath5 with larger values of @xmath12 .",
    "the global spin - orbital phase diagram for the rvo@xmath5 family including the concomitant structural phase transitions derived from the single - crystal measurements was reported.@xcite . based on a spin - orbital superexchange model for rvo@xmath5",
    "a scenario of the puzzling transition between the two above - mention ordered phases was suggested.@xcite    in the present paper , our main concern is to the local properties of vanadium valence 3@xmath0 electrons .",
    "the local part @xmath18 of the underlying hubbard - type model contains the crystal field @xmath19 and the coulomb @xmath20 terms : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is an energy of the @xmath23-th 3@xmath0 orbital , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the hubbard repulsion and hund s exchange parameters , respectively .",
    "when restricted only to the @xmath7 subspace , the hamiltonian with the same exchange parameters , @xmath26 , describes rigorously the multiplet structure of @xmath3 and @xmath27 configurations.@xcite    because the octahedra vo@xmath11 in rvo@xmath5 are tilted and distorted , the exact point symmetry at v ion is rather low - the only operation allowed is the inversion , and the cubic 3@xmath0 basis functions , @xmath7 and @xmath28 , are generally mixed .",
    "nevertheless , one expects that a higher point symmetry , for instance , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , can be applied to approximate accurately the cf levels and the electronic multiplet structure of the system . in support of this conjecture",
    ", we have performed complementary @xmath31 quantum - chemical calculations@xcite for a crystal fragment containing the rotated and distorted cluster vo@xmath11 .",
    "the calculated valence states are found to be hybridized v - ion 3@xmath0- and oxygen 2@xmath9-orbitals , and in a local orthogonal frame associated with the principal axes of a rotated octahedron these ( antibonding ) molecular orbitals can be viewed as the canonical @xmath7 and @xmath28 ones . in the following ,",
    "they are referred to as vanadium valence 3@xmath0 orbitals , and the model hamiltonian , eq.([1 ] ) , is applied to them as well . to estimate model parameters , energies of several crystal - field multiplets of the valence @xmath32 configuration , including @xmath3 and @xmath33 ,",
    "were calculated for the cluster vo@xmath11 and compared with those derived from eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "we found that the expected for @xmath30 ( or @xmath29 ) point symmetry character of a comparatively weak non - cubic cf splitting , both within the @xmath7 and @xmath28 subspaces , is well supported by the computed spectra , which is commented in detail below .",
    "since the main focus is on the low - energy electronic properties and their measurements by rixs , the calculated multiplet structure of the @xmath3 configuration is mostly discussed .    to be more precise",
    ", we note that in the orthorhombic structure of rvo@xmath5 there are four non - equivalent crystallographic positions of v - ions coordinated with oxygen octahedra that are rotated by the same angles in alternate manner . for a given v ion , assuming the @xmath34- , @xmath35- , and @xmath36-axes of the local coordinate system attached to the principal axes of the rotated oxygen octahedron , we define the @xmath7 orbitals as follows : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the angular part of the orbital wavefunctions are described by real spherical harmonics : @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] , and @xmath42 $ ] , with @xmath43 being the canonical spherical harmonics .    in our _ ab initio",
    "_ quantum - chemical cluster approach based on the use of molpro computer program@xcite , the wave functions and energies of electron configurations are calculated at different levels of accuracy - from a single - reference restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) method through a multi - configuration self - consistent field ( mcscf ) ansatz to the multi - reference configuration - interaction method ( mrci).@xcite the lattice fragment , whose electrons are treated rigorously , contains the cluster vo@xmath11 and eight neighboring r ions , and it is imbedded in a large point - charge environment that simulates the madelung potential on the cluster ions .    in our calculations",
    "the primary emphasis was placed upon the most widely studied compound yvo@xmath5 .",
    "the structural lattice data with the actual rotation , tilting and distortion of vo@xmath11 , reported@xcite for yvo@xmath5 were used .",
    "although the situation is likely to depend on the changing degree of octahedral tilting across the rvo@xmath5 series@xcite , we expect that the generic features derived can be directly extended to other members of the rvo@xmath5 family , at least to those with close values of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind such an extended usage of our cluster calculations , most representative results are reported throughout . as expected the calculated subspaces @xmath28 and @xmath7",
    "are well separated by a large cubic cf of @xmath441.5ev . for the high - temperature ( @xmath45200k ) orthorhombic structure",
    "the lowest electronic orbital is @xmath46 , while the pair of @xmath47 , @xmath48 is shifted up by @xmath49ev , and these two are only weakly split by @xmath50mev .",
    "the inequality @xmath51 can be partly explained for the high-@xmath52 phase by the observation@xcite that in each oxygen octahedron the tetragonal - like contraction of the v - o bonds along @xmath36-axis is regularly larger than an orthorhombic distortion of the v - o bonds in the @xmath53-plane . because the energy resolution of rixs spectra is usually limited to @xmath4450mev , in the multiplet structure fine features due to orthorhombic cf level splitting of @xmath50mev can be hardly resolved .",
    "therefore , in subsequent theoretical analysis of the local electronic structure characteristic of the high-@xmath52 phase of rvo@xmath5 , instead of @xmath29 we use the tetragonal @xmath30 symmetry by setting @xmath54 and denoting the largest non - cubic cf parameter for the @xmath7 manifold as @xmath55 .",
    "this is in contrast to the cf model suggested in ref .. there , the authors assumed the cubic point symmetry @xmath56 with fully degenerate @xmath7 levels in the high-@xmath52 phase and a symmetry reduction from @xmath56 to @xmath30 ( or @xmath29 ) was associated with structural transitions below 200k .",
    "in high-@xmath52 phase of rvo@xmath5 the low - energy part of the rixs spectra is expected to exhibit the multiplet structure of @xmath3 configuration .",
    "hereafter , a simplifying approximation is used that consists in the neglect of comparatively small alternating tilts of oxygen octahedra .",
    "thus all the vanadium ions are considered to be equivalent and the 3@xmath0 orbitals are defined in the global ( @xmath57)-coordinate system with @xmath58-axis along the orthorhombic @xmath59-axis , while @xmath60- and @xmath61-axis are rotated by 45@xmath62 with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    for the cf of @xmath30 symmetry ,",
    "the states of @xmath3 configuration are sorted over the terms @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and 2 @xmath70 , where a subscript indicating the same ( even ) parity of terms is omitted for brevity . for a given term @xmath71",

    ", it follows also that , first , the lowest spin - triplet level coming from the @xmath33 configuration falls into the same energy range - it is stuffed between @xmath83 and @xmath70 , but not indicated in fig.1 .",
    "second , the estimated value of hund s constant is @xmath84ev , which is somewhat smaller than that reported usually in literature.@xcite    for the further purposes , it is instructive to present explicitly the basis functions of several terms under consideration . for instance , the ground - state term @xmath65 comprises six states : @xmath85,\\   |d_{\\eta \\downarrow}d_{\\zeta\\downarrow}\\rangle   $ ] , for @xmath86 , and the other three states @xmath87 for @xmath88 are obtained by the replacement @xmath89 .",

    "then , in the second - quantization form the dipole operator eq.([a5 ] ) reads ( @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 here the operator @xmath123 destroys an electron with the orbital projection @xmath124 and spin @xmath125 in the @xmath4 shell , while @xmath126 creates an extra electron with the same spin in the @xmath23-th orbital of the @xmath2-shell , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 contains an integral over radial @xmath4 and @xmath2 wavefunctions .",
    "one may check that @xmath129 . at this stage",

    "the insertion of eq.([a7 ] ) into eq.([a6 ] ) splits the dipole operator : @xmath133 .",
    "below we focus on the @xmath134-edge scattering processes only and , therefore , in eq.([a7 ] ) the sum is bounded to @xmath135 = @xmath136 , @xmath137 , for @xmath132 = 3/2 .    by applying the circular components @xmath138 to vectors @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the scattering amplitude eq.([a2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the polarization tensor and @xmath143 is called the partial amplitude.@xcite    from eqs.([a2]),([a6 ] ) , and ( [ a8 ] ) one may see that a scattering process being considered as the sequence of two local dipole transitions is modulated in space by the phase factor @xmath144 $ ] , which makes it possible to measure , besides the local @xmath0-@xmath0 excitation , the dispersion laws of accessible propagating electronic excitations.@xcite these include spin and orbital waves , and their mixture in spin - orbital ordered phases , as well as delocalized excitonic states whose propagation may be largely influenced by spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis of the in - gap excitation spectra , together with the corresponding transition probabilities and polarization dependence , has to be started with a calculation of a generic local dipole transitions .",
    "the frequently used fast collision approximation@xcite may considerably simplify a theoretical analysis of rixs processes .",
    "in general outline , instead of taking proper account of the individual scattering events that connect the ground state @xmath100}\\rangle   $ ] to a given final state @xmath105}\\rangle   $ ] through the intermediary of core - hole states , in this approximation one simply applies an averaging procedure that consists in the replacement of the intermediate - state propagator by a resonance factor @xmath145 .",
    "such an approximation could be well justified if , for instance , the lifetime broadening @xmath75 of the intermediate core - hole states probed is comparatively large , which is not the case in vanadium oxides where @xmath146 0.3ev is much smaller than the intermediate - state interactions .    to go beyond the fast collision approximation one has to take into account the multiplet structure of the intermediate core - hole states explicitly .",
    "the problem is extremely complicated by the fact that in the transition metal ions involved ( i.e. , v ions ) the intra - atomic 2@xmath9 - 3@xmath0 interactions are strong , or more precisely , the coulomb and exchange 2@xmath9 - 3@xmath0 integrals are of the same order as those for the valence 3@xmath0 orbitals .",
    "as known , the multiplet structure of core - hole states is directly measured by the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) . nowadays ,",
    "xas spectra for strongly correlated electronic systems are usually predicted and/or the measured spectra are interpreted with the use of specially designed computer programs .",
    "@xcite    in principle , the computer code for quantum - chemical cluster calculations we used for calculating the multiplet structure of @xmath32 configuration of v@xmath6 ion ( section ii ) , can be extended and applied for solving the core - hole multiplets as well . nevertheless , it is tempting first to apply the symmetry - group technique and determine the intermediate - state many - electron wavefunctions of interest , and then proceed to the calculation of rixs amplitudes without using complementary numerical procedures - the goal that is pursued in the following discussion .",

    "first , we define the auxiliary states @xmath164 of the @xmath165 configuration not disturbed by @xmath153 .",

    "below we refer to @xmath166 as the generating multiplet .",
    "eq.([a13 ] ) suggests a conventional basis for a diagonalization of the local hamiltonian , eq.([a9 ] ) .",
    "insofar as states of repeating representations are mixed by @xmath153 , the matrix of @xmath152 takes a block - diagonal form , which can be solved numerically to give the full multiplet structure of the core - hole configuration @xmath191 .",
    "here , the main difficulty stems from the fact that complicated vector - coupled functions , eqs.([a11 ] ) and ( [ a13 ] ) , come into play and calculation of numerous off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath152 becomes very tedious .",
    "nevertheless , close analysis shows that in several cases calculations are greatly simplified and some prominent features of the multiplet structure of a core - hole configuration can be evaluated without dealing with the full form of high - rank matrices of @xmath152 .",
    "a particular example is considered in the next section .",
    "let us first apply the outlined procedure for examining the states of those @xmath199 s that are related to the lowest generating term @xmath166=@xmath171 . because @xmath91 the is one - dimensional representation , the eq.([a11 ] )",
    "allows the following identification @xmath201 with the final kets defined in eq.([a10 ] ) .",
    "then , according to eq.([a13 ] ) , all irreducible representations @xmath199 s generated from the term @xmath171 are contained in the direct group product @xmath202 and given@xcite in the following decomposition : @xmath203 . without @xmath4-@xmath2 interactions",
    "the terms are degenerate , however , being subjected to @xmath153 they are split into two subsets in such a way that each subset is coupled by @xmath153 to states of other multiplets in different manners . to exhibit this splitting , the term energies are preliminary",
    "found to the first order in @xmath153 by calculating the corresponding diagonal matrix elements of the local hamiltonian , eq.([a9 ] ) .",
    "this yields three lowest terms , @xmath91 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , residing at the same energy that is taken below as the reference ( zero ) level .",
    "then , the other four terms are shifted to higher energies as follows : @xmath206 at @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 at @xmath210 , and @xmath211 at @xmath212 .    the states of three lowest terms , @xmath91 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , the first subset , can be regarded as `` edge '' resonant states for several reasons .",
    "firstly , to any order in @xmath153 the `` edge '' states are not mixed with other states of the @xmath191 configuration - the corresponding off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath152 are checked to be zero . to the contrary , the second subset , i.e. , the states of complementary multiplets @xmath206 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath211 , are mixed up with states @xmath213 of similar multiplets generated from @xmath214@xmath171 and located well above the reference level . in total , this mixture gives rise to a broad and dense manifold of intermediate states @xmath215 , but still the energy of `` edge '' states is retained below the bottom of this broad manifold .",
    "the `` edge '' states are stabilized mainly due to , first , that the initial energy of the generating term @xmath171 is well below the positions of other terms @xmath214@xmath171 and , second , for @xmath216 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 the exchange coupling of the valence states @xmath217 to the core states @xmath218 due to @xmath153 is optimized .",
    "experimentally , concerning the @xmath134-edge xas / rixs measurements in rvo@xmath5 , the `` edge '' states should be associated with the lowest peak expected at the very edge of the xas absorption spectra , while in rixs they are accessible by tuning the incident photons to the lowest resonance energy @xmath219 , i.e. , as @xmath220 .",
    "thus emerging multiplet structure of the core - hole configuration @xmath221 suggests that close to the `` edge''-states associated with the resonance at @xmath219 , the remaining terms @xmath199 evolve into a peak - shaped structure of several features at higher energies , @xmath222 , for @xmath223 .",
    "particular peaks initially assigned to different @xmath199 s are broadened due the core - hole lifetime effects .",
    "a group of peaks may overlap if their energy spacing is less than the core - hole lifetime broadening .",
    "this means that a set of core - hole states @xmath190 that are included in a group of `` closely spaced '' @xmath199 s , are not resolved and should be attributed to a peculiar resonance energy @xmath224 , which is denoted below as @xmath225 .",
    "then the partial amplitude of corresponding local transitions can be expressed in the following form @xmath226|{\\overline { \\mathcal d}_{q\\prime}}|t^3 \\underline{p}\\ , \\gamma_j\\gamma_j\\rangle    \\langle t^3 \\underline{p}\\ , \\gamma_j\\gamma_j|{\\mathcal d}_{q}|t^2,[g]\\rangle } { z_k - \\hbar\\omega_{res}^{(n)}},\\label{a15}\\ ] ] where @xmath227 is the @xmath228th component of the dipole operator , eq.([a6 ] ) , taken at @xmath229 .",

    "the explicit form of `` edge '' states follows directly from eqs.([a11 ] ) and ( [ a13 ] ) . in eq.([a13 ] ) the coupling coefficients @xmath233 required for @xmath234 and @xmath216 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , are found from tables of ref .. for the sake of brevity , we reduce slightly the notation as follows : @xmath235 .",
    "complementary reduction includes both @xmath236 , where @xmath189 for the core - hole states , and @xmath237 for the `` edge''-state kets . in shortened notations",

    "a connection of the ground state @xmath93\\rangle$ ] to particular final states @xmath94\\rangle$ ] depicted in fig.1 and a polarization dependence of the transitions are of the main interest .",
    "the calculations show that besides the elastic transition , latexmath:[$|t^2,(^3e)m_ge_g\\rangle \\to    @xmath3 configuration accessible via the resonance at @xmath219 is @xmath66 , fig.1 .",
    "this occurs in the processes @xmath248 with the initial and final states being degenerate in @xmath249 , @xmath28(@xmath250 ) and @xmath251 , respectively , for the disordered high-@xmath52 phase .",
    "as seen from fig.1 , the corresponding excitation energy is @xmath252 , and thus the basic cf parameter can be measured directly together with a fully identified excitonic state .",
    "a possible band broadening of this excitonic state is discussed later on .",
    "identification of this peculiar @xmath0-@xmath0 transition in rixs measurements of rvo@xmath5 would enhance a better understanding of the system .",
    "for instance , a trend of interest that @xmath253 develops upon replacement of @xmath254 ion in rvo@xmath5 can be followed .",
    "second , from eqs.([a15]),([a17 ] ) one obtains the transition intensity @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the known constant.@xcite note that in eq.([a18 ] ) an averaging over the initial states and summation over the final states are performed assuming the state degeneracy mentioned . from this , the calculated polarization dependence is given up to a factor as @xmath257 which may serve for a verification of the previously discussed orbital occupancy both in the initial and the excited states .",
    "the rixs @xmath0-@xmath0 transitions to the states of higher - energy terms @xmath258@xmath66 listed in fig.1 can be measured via the resonance processes that occur as @xmath259 , with @xmath260 .",
    "contrary to the lowest resonance , @xmath261 , now the process @xmath262 branches off , meaning that for given @xmath263 there are several accessible final terms @xmath264 .",
    "theoretically , the intertwined transitions involved could be unraveled provided the relative energy positions of the resonance energies @xmath224 and the explicit form of intermediate core - hole states @xmath265 are found , which would again require using computer codes .",
    "although the overall inspection of the rixs processes is not given herein , nevertheless a valuable piece of information regarding the expected rixs spectra is predicted , as presented in fig.1 together with complementary estimates in section ii , and the lowest @xmath0-@xmath0 excitation is studied in great detail .",
    "so far , when classifying the multiplets of the @xmath266 configurations based on the symmetry - group technique , we assumed that in high-@xmath52 phase a deviation from the @xmath30 symmetry is too weak to be resolved experimentally .",
    "with decreasing temperature , one expects that the deviation increases and the experimental resolution permits the main effects of the symmetry reduction @xmath267 to be observed in rixs spectra .",
    "although , a reduction of the former multiplet structure of @xmath3 configuration to a new one due to the local symmetry lowering is a routine theoretical procedure , a precise analysis of the expected _ fine _ structure of rixs spectra at low temperatures is further complicated by the spin - orbital ordering . actually , since in the lattice the neighboring v ions are now coupled by the inter - site spin - orbital superexchange , the states of a local multiplet are split by internal exchange fields and the former degeneracy is removed . in particular , the symmetry breaking of the ground - state multiplet @xmath65 gives rise to a number of low - energy spin / orbital excitations whose energy position ( and dispersion properties ) are set by the superexchange constant @xmath26810mev , and hence the excitations are expected@xcite well below 0.1ev . from the perspective of rixs measurements , the energy region of interest , @xmath2690.1ev , is typically submerged by the tail of the huge elastic peak , which makes the selection of the lowest spectral features a problematic procedure .    in this respect ,",
    "the promising dispersive quasiparticles for the rixs measurement originate from the @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations thus far regarded to be localized excitons , i.e. , the bound electron - hole pairs in the valence @xmath7 subshell of v ion .",
    "a mechanism behind the exciton delocalization is very similar to that proposed for the orbital wave propagation.@xcite it involves a simultaneous exchange of two _ active _ @xmath7 orbitals at neighboring v - v pairs forming three distinguished bonds along lattice axes .",
    "for instance , since in the lowest @xmath0-@xmath0 excitation of @xmath66 symmetry the @xmath270 orbital involved is _ inactive _ along z@xmath271 axis , the dispersion law of the corresponding exciton is of pure two - dimensional form : @xmath272 . here ,",
    "rough estimate for the bandwidth is @xmath273 , where @xmath274mev and the parameter @xmath275 takes into account the temperature dependent spin and orbital intersite correlations in different phases .",
    "the excitonic gap @xmath276 is determined by the @xmath7 orbital cf splitting @xmath277 renormalized compared to @xmath253 due to intersite superexchange coupling . in disordered high-@xmath52 phase of rvo@xmath5 , one has @xmath278 , assuming that a small self - energy correction due to virtual intersite @xmath279-electron hoppings is already included into @xmath253 that should be measured .",
    "we conclude this short discussion with a general remark that much more work is needed to discriminate all possible delocalization mechanisms responsible for a formation of propagating excitonic states .",
    "it seems that a further improvement of the experimental rixs resolution towards the 10 mev level is required to measure these quasiparticles .",
    "to summarize , we developed the rixs theory and applied it to predict most prominent features of the low - energy @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations that can be measured in rvo@xmath5 - a prototypical mott - hubbard insulator with @xmath279 configuration of v@xmath6 ions . complementary _",
    "ab initio _ cluster calculations allowed us to estimate the crystal field parameters and choose a proper basis set for vanadium @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "initial ( ground ) , intermediate , and final states accessible in rixs processes were classified with the use of the symmetry - group technique , which is prerequisite to the subsequent analysis developed . to go beyond the fast collision approximation",
    "frequently used for calculations of the rixs transition amplitude , we examined the intermediate core - hole states , including the spectral and symmetry properties of many - electron wavefunctions , with more detail than usually done before .",
    "eventually , the problem of deducing a detailed overall picture for the intermediate states was reduced to a diagonalization of a local hamiltonian which involves the valence electron @xmath0-@xmath0 and the core - hole - valence @xmath280 interactions . mostly because of the huge number of many - body core - hole states entangled , the diagonalization procedure is far from being a trivial one .",
    "as well known , such a difficulty one encounters in any theoretical analysis of xas spectra@xcite in strongly correlated electron systems , which requires using specially designed computer codes . at this stage",
    ", we avoided doing any numerical calculations , but instead pursued an analytical treatment so far as possible and found , for instance , that a comprehensive analysis of the lowest @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations is attainable in a simple fashion .",
    "for the basic @xmath3 configuration , the relative spectral position of @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations of higher energy is predicted and expressed in terms of a model hamiltonian describing the local electronic properties of rvo@xmath5 . in the present study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the calculation of rixs spectra expected in a spin- and orbital - disordered high-@xmath52 phase of rvo@xmath5 .",
    "an extension to ordered phases , which is only shortly discussed , may be a subject of a further work .",
    "delocalization of low - energy @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations leading to a formation of propagating excitonic states was also discussed and some predictions were formulated .",
    "along this way , a future careful theoretical study and subsequent examination by rixs of low - energy excitations in rvo@xmath5 will provide a better understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for rich properties observed in this promising system .",
    "to conclude , we believe that the suggested theoretical approach may be extended and applied to a description of selective rixs transitions in other transition metal oxides with partially filled @xmath7 orbitals . in further perspective , the _ ab initio _ quantum - chemical cluster approach can be also applied first to calculate multiplet structure of both the ground - state @xmath281 and the core - hole @xmath282 configurations and , second , to evaluate the matrix elements of the dipole transition operator between them . in this context",
