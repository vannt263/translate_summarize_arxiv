    "the detailed phase - space distribution of cold dark matter haloes can substantially affect prospects for dark matter detection .",
    "direct detection experiments are starting to probe significant fractions of the parameter space of plausible theoretical models , so a first detection of dark matter ( dm ) may be imminent .",
    "only recently has realistic prediction of the phase - space structure near the earth become possible , because very high - resolution numerical simulations are required .",
    "it is now well established that the outer regions of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes have a complicated phase - space structure with many subhaloes and tidal streams @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether similar structures might affect direct detection probabilities .",
    "could the earth be sitting in a `` hole '' , i.e. a locally very underdense region , in the dm distribution , as might occur in a fractal structure , or if most of the mass near the sun were concentrated in dense , low - mass subhaloes .",
    "some simulators have indeed argued that a significant fraction of the local mass could lie in solar or earth - mass subhaloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although more recent simulations suggest that the local mass fraction in bound subhaloes of any mass is well below 1% @xcite . other possibilities might be for the earth to lie within a subhalo , or within a dense tidal stream created by disruption of an earlier subhalo .",
    "either of these would produce a spike in the velocity distribution of local dark matter particles .    quantifying the detailed phase - space structure of a halo requires disentangling its various dm components : the smooth component which is , in fact , a superposition of many fundamental streams @xcite ; compact , self - bound subhaloes ; and tidal streams created by the disruption of such subhaloes .",
    "efficient identification of the tidal streams requires a sensitive and robust structure - finder in 6d phase - space .",
    "recently @xcite presented an algorithm , hierarchical structure finder ( hsf ) , designed specifically for this purpose .",
    "hsf identifies structures in an n - body simulation as coherent , overdense sets of particles in the full 6d position - velocity distribution . in this paper",
    "we use hsf to study the six galaxy - scale halos simulated as part of the aquarius project @xcite , providing a quantitative analysis of the various halo components and focussing , in particular , on the inner halo relevant for detection experiments .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : section [ sec : hsf ] presents a brief description of our hierarchical structure finder .",
    "section [ sec : str ] then explores the numerical convergence of our results by analysing simulations of a single halo at a variety of resolutions .",
    "finally we use the full set of six aquarius halos to study the expected scatter in substructure properties among galaxy - scale halos .",
    "section [ sec : inn ] focusses on substructure in the inner halo in order to assess possible consequences for direct detection experiments .",
    "the final section gives our conclusions .",
    "many different algorithms for identifying ( sub)structure have been applied to n - body simulations of the growth of cosmic structure .",
    "one of the first and most widely used is the friends - of - friends ( fof ) scheme introduced by @xcite ; this defines `` halos '' as disjoint particle sets containing every particle closer than some maximal linking length to at least one other member of its set .",
    "this bounds objects approximately by an isodensity surface , but makes no assumption about their shape or internal structure .",
    "in contrast , the spherical overdensity ( so ) group - finder of @xcite finds high - density peaks in the particle distribution , grows spheres centred on each until the mean enclosed density drops to a specified value ( typically @xmath11 times the cosmological mean ) and then defines halos as the contents of those spheres whose centres do not lie within a more massive halo .",
    "more recent structure - finders [ e.g. skid @xcite , subfind @xcite , voboz @xcite , psb @xcite , adaptahop @xcite , ahf @xcite , hsf @xcite ] typically identify objects as connected self - bound particle sets above some density threshold .",
    "such methods have two steps .",
    "each particle is first linked to a local dm density maximum by following the gradient of a particle - based estimate of the underlying dm density field .",
    "the particle set attached to a given maximum defines a candidate structure . in a second step , particles which are gravitationally unbound to the structure",
    "are discarded until a fully self - bound final object is obtained .",
    "the various methods differ in the way particles are treated when they belong to more than one candidate and in the way unbound particles are redistributed .",
    "most methods produce a hierarchical characterisation of structure where halos contain subhaloes which in turn can contain their own subhaloes .",
    "these methods can be extended to higher dimensions , in particular to 6d phase - space .",
    "the main complication is then that the smoothed density field and its gradient must be estimated from the particle distribution in six dimensions .",
    "the hierarchichal structure finder ( hsf ) presented by @xcite is an algorithm of this type , and can be used , just like the above 3d algorithms , to identify bound subhaloes .",
    "other six dimensional phase - space structure finders have been developed recently by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* enlink ) . in the following",
    "we describe the hsf method in somewhat more detail , since this is the method we will use for the rest of this paper . further technical details and tests can be found in @xcite .    to find candidate structures we first need to estimate phase - space densities at the positions of all the particles .",
    "furthermore we need to calculate local phase - space density gradients .",
    "hsf does this using a six - dimensional sph smoothing kernel with a local adaptive metric as implemented in the enbid code @xcite .",
    "neighbouring particles can then be used to derive the required gradients . for the sph kernel we use @xmath12 neighbours whereas for the gradient estimate we use @xmath13 neighbours .    once phase - space densities have been calculated",
    ", we sort the particles according to their density in descending order . then we start to grow structures from high to low phase - space densities .",
    "while walking down in density we mark for each particle the two closest ( according to the local phase - space metric ) neighbours with higher phase - space density , if such particles exist . in this way",
    "we grow disjoint structures until we encounter a saddle point , which can be identified by observing the two marked particles and seeing if they belong to different structures .",
    "a saddle point occurs at the border of two structures . in the standard setup of hsf , which is used throughout this paper , the masses of the two structures separated by the saddle point",
    "are compared and the smaller one is cut , defining a complete individual structure . all particles below the saddle point whose higher density neighbours are part of the cut object are attached to the other , larger structure .",
    "pursuing this procedure until all particles have been considered divides a halo into a unique disjoint set of substructures , of which the most massive , which also contains the lowest phase - density particles , is the main substructure .",
    "when we wish to isolate self - bound subhaloes , we follow an identical procedure , except that each time we reach a saddle point , we remove all unbound particles iteratively from the smaller structure and attach them provisionally to the larger structure .",
    "once we have followed this algorithm down to the lowest phase - density particle , we are left with a set of self - bound subhaloes and a few particles which are bound to no subhalo , not even the most massive self - bound subhalo which again is the one containing the lowest phase - density bound particles .",
    "both these procedures divide a halo into a disjoint set of phase - space structures , each containing a single phase - space density peak and bounded approximately by a level surface of phase - space density . in the first procedure each structure normally contains both bound and unbound particles , and all halo particles",
    "are assigned to some structure . in the second procedure ,",
    "each structure is self - bound , and some halo particles are not assigned to any structure . to be specific ,",
    "in the following we will refer to all particles inside @xmath0 times the critical value .",
    "halo_. we call the most massive substructure constructed from these particles the _ main halo_. note that by definition it can not extend beyond @xmath0 and that its mean density within @xmath0 will be less than 50 times the critical density . note also that the main halo will change slightly according to whether we do or do not apply the unbinding and reassignment procedures . in the former case",
    "we refer to all other structures as ( self - bound ) _ subhaloes _ , whereas in the latter case we refer to them as _",
    "substructures_. a subhalo is thus always part of a substructure , but a substructure does not necessarily contain a subhalo .",
    "we study the phase - space structure of milky way - sized dm haloes using the high - resolution simulations of the aquarius project @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters for these simulations are @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "for this project six galaxy - mass haloes ( aq - a to aq - f ) were selected from a lower resolution version of the millennium - ii simulation @xcite and resimulated with progressively higher particle number and smaller softening length .",
    "the haloes were selected to have no close massive companion at @xmath17 .",
    "when studying differences in phase - space structure between these haloes , we use the second resolution level ( the highest for which results are available for all six objects ) . at this resolution",
    "all haloes have more than @xmath18 particles inside @xmath0 , corresponding to a particle mass @xmath19 . in addition , we use resimulations of the aq - a halo at four different resolution levels to check the numerical convergence of our results . in the final section of this paper",
    "we investigate phase - space structure in the inner halo , defined as @xmath20  kpc . for this purpose",
    "we use three resolution levels of the aq - a halo with the largest one ( aq - a-1 ) having almost @xmath21 particles inside @xmath0 and more than @xmath22 particles inside @xmath23 .",

    "[ volume ] shows the probability distribution function of dm density for various structures in the inner halo . to make this plot we first estimated the density at the position of every particle with radius between 6 and 12  kpc using a standard sph scheme based on 32 neighbours .",
    "as described in @xcite , we then fitted a smooth model to these values assuming the density to be stratified on similar , concentric ellipsoids and to be a power law of radius .",
    "this defines a model density @xmath68 at the position of each particle which can be compared with the directly estimated local density .",
    "this step is crucial to account for the large density gradients in the inner halo so that we can focus on small - scale variations due to substructure .",
    "we then repeat the sph density estimates for the subsets of particles in this radial range corresponding to each individual subcomponent : the main subhalo and each individual self - bound subhalo and substructure . in the following",
    "we plot all density distributions as functions of @xmath69 and we construct volume - weighted probability distributions by histogramming the particles with individual weights @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the particle mass and @xmath72 the total volume between 6 and 12  kpc . for the total mass distribution and the main subhalo the resulting distributions give the probability that an observer at a random point in this radial range will see local density contrast @xmath73 .",
    "for the self - bound subhalo and substructure components , the distributions show the mean number of self - bound subhaloes or substructures with local density contrast @xmath69 at a random point .",
    "if we consider first the probability distribution of density contrast for the total mass ( i.e. the sum of all the components ) we see that there is a lognormal distribution centred on @xmath74 with an additional low amplitude , power - law tail to high densities .",
    "this result was already given in @xcite .",
    "as they showed , the lognormal part of the distribution reflects discreteness noise in our density estimator .",
    "we demonstrate this again here by plotting as a dashed black line the distribution of analogous density estimates for points sampled from a uniform poisson distribution .",
    "this line can not be distinguished from that corresponding to the main subhalo in fig .",
    "[ volume ] , demonstrating that this component follows our ellipsoidal model very closely .",
    "the power law tail is due to self - bound subhaloes , as is evident from its close agreement with the distribution calculated directly from this component .",
    "this general behaviour was pointed out not only in the analysis of this same simulation by @xcite , but also in the analytic model of @xcite and in the analysis of a different high resolution simulation by @xcite .",
    "if we now consider the density contrast distributions of the individual components , we see that self - bound subhaloes are detectable not only in the high - density tail but also down to contrasts as small as @xmath75 .",
    "this reflects the excellent resolution of the aq - a-1 simulation and , more importantly , the fact that our 6-d structure finder can identify subhalo material even at very low density contrast because of its small internal velocity dispersion .",
    "hsf identifies general phase - space substructure ( e.g. tidal streams ) down to even lower contrasts , of order @xmath76 .",
    "the additional substructure mass which is not part of self - bound subhaloes is almost entirely in this low - contrast regime .",
    "it is interesting that the `` probability '' a random point lies in such a low - density tidal stream reaches values _ much _",
    "larger than one , meaning that hsf has identified multiple structures at each point in 3-space .",
    "note , however , that because low - density tidal streams have an effective spatial dimensionality less than 3 , their @xmath69 values are biased low ( and the mean stream number correspondingly high ) by the spherical kernel of the sph density estimator . in the radial range between 6 and 12  kpc selected for this analysis about @xmath77 of the mass is in the form of self - bound subhaloes and about @xmath78 in substructure .",
    "thus low - density tidal streams account for almost 90% of the substructure detected by hsf .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ volume ] shows , for the various components , a cumulative plot of the mass at local density contrast exceeding @xmath69 , expressed as a fraction of the total mass between 6 and 12  kpc . here",
    "we see explicitly that the substructure component contains almost ten times as much mass as the bound subhalo component and that this excess lies almost exclusively at contrasts below 0.1 .",
    "this panel also gives similar cumulative data for the five individually most massive self - bound subhaloes and for the five individually most massive substructures .",
    "almost a third of the mass in self - bound subhaloes is contained in these five objects , almost all of it at density contrasts exceeding unity",
    ". however , only the most massive subhalo corresponds to one of the five most massive substructures , accounting for most of its mass .",
    "the other four massive substructures are unbound tidal streams with no associated subhalo .",
    "the maximum density contrast of these unbound streams is @xmath79 ( again this is probably biased low ) .",
    "the five most massive substructures together account for only about 10% of the total substructure mass .      not only the mass density , but also the velocity distribution of dm particles in the vicinity of the earth is relevant for direct detection experiments .",
    "@xcite showed that although this velocity distribution is quite well approximated by a smooth trivariate gaussian , potentially measurable features are imprinted on the corresponding energy distribution by the detailed formation history of the milky way s halo . here",
    "we concentrate on the velocities of the different phase - space components in the inner halo . in fig .",
    "[ vrvt ] we show @xmath51-@xmath80 projections of the distribution of all particles in the radial range 6 to 12  kpc ( top ) , of those in substructures ( middle ) , and of those in self - bound subhaloes ( bottom ) .",
    "these plots are two - dimensional histograms , with colour encoding the mass in the corresponding bin as indicated by the colour bar ( in units of solar masses per @xmath39  km / s x @xmath39",
    "km / s pixel ) .",
    "the total mass contributing to each panel is given in its top right - hand corner .",
    "the main halo and so the bulk of the particles lie primarily at velocities below 200  km  s@xmath81 , whereas subhaloes and tidal streams are found almost exclusively at higher velocities . as a result ,",
    "the most massive subhaloes are still ( just ) visible in the top panel despite the fact that they contribute less than a tenth of a percent of the mass .",
    "these structures contribute to the high - energy tail of the recoil spectrum in direct dm detection experiments , and so may be visible in high resolution experiments , particularly those with directional sensitivity which can detect the common motion of the substructure particles .     ",

    "the top , middle and bottom panels show the distributions for all particles , for substructures and for subhaloes respectively .",

    "we study the population of subhaloes and tidal streams in six milky way - like dm haloes taken from the aquarius project .",
    "these structures are identified using the hierarchical structure finder ( hsf * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a state - of - the - art structure finder which operates in 6-d phase - space .",
    "we find that that the differential mass function of self - bound subhaloes can be well described by a power - law with slope close to @xmath29 .",
    "this agrees with results from an independent analysis using the 3-d structure finder subfind @xcite .",
    "typically hsf attaches slightly more particles to subhaloes than subfind , and also finds slightly more subhaloes above the simulation resolution limit ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this agrees with previous results described in @xcite .",
    "about 14% of the mass within @xmath0 is in self - bound subhaloes , with significant scatter among the six haloes aq - a to aq - f .",
    "hsf subhalo masses are @xmath83 larger than those found by subfind , although the increase can be larger near halo centre . in most haloes",
    "the total subhalo mass is dominated by the largest objects .",
    "the radial distributions of hsf and subfind subhaloes are almost identical , although hsf can identify subhaloes closer to halo centre due to their enhanced density contrast in phase - space .",
    "the differential mass function for substructures ( i.e. both subhaloes and tidal streams ) is also well described with a power - law , but in this case the slope is close to @xmath3 .",
    "this is independent of simulation resolution and holds approximately for all six haloes , thus appearing robust . for most of the level 2",
    "haloes around @xmath1 of the mass within @xmath0 is assigned to substructures with mass above @xmath84 .",
    "the radial distribution of these objects can be approximated by equation ( [ eq : fsub ] ) introduced in @xcite but with a higher normalisation than applies for self - bound subhaloes . in the inner halo almost @xmath85 times as much mass is detected in unbound tidal streams as in self - bound subhaloes .",
    "this reflects the efficiency with which tidal forces destroy bound subhaloes in the inner halo .    in our highest resolution halo ,",
    "aq - a-1 , hsf assigns about @xmath8 of the mass within @xmath7  kpc to self - bound subhaloes , and about @xmath9 to substructures ( subhaloes and tidal streams ) , with masses higher then @xmath86 . in this region",
    "the largest phase - space substructures are either self - bound subhaloes with massive tidal tails stretching across the entire inner @xmath7  kpc region or equally massive tidal streams with no attached subhalo at @xmath87  kpc .",
    "the largest individual substructures in the inner region have masses up to @xmath88 .",
    "@xcite showed that the density field in the radial range from 6 to 12  kpc is very well represented by a simple smooth model where density is stratified on similar concentric ellipsoids and falls as a power law of radius .",
    "fluctuations around this model are small except for a low - amplitude power - law tail to high density contrast which corresponds to self - bound subhaloes .",
    "our hsf analysis is consistent with these results and allows us , in addition , to study the contrast of individual substructures with respect to the smooth background , the main subhalo , in which they are embedded .",
    "hsf is able to identify not only the high - contrast cores of individual self - bound subhaloes , but also their outskirts where the density contrast drops to values as low as @xmath89 .",
    "the maximum contrast of unbound tidal streams is @xmath79 .",
    "since these streams contain @xmath61 of the total mass between 6 and 12  kpc , of order one massive tidal stream is predicted to pass through every point , contributing a few tenths of a percent of the local dm density .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath77 of the mass in this region is contributed by self - bound subhaloes , and the chance that the earth lies in the high - density contrast region of such a subhalo is below @xmath75 .",
    "both subhaloes and tidal streams populate the high - energy tail of the velocity distribution preferentially , and would show up in direct dm detection experiments as a small but significant part of the signal in events with almost identical ( vector ) momenta .",
    "the aquarius project was carried out as part of the activities of the virgo consortium .",
    "we thank the consortium members responsible for setting up and executing the simulations , as well as the consortium as whole for making them available to us .",
