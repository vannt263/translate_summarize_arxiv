    "in a recent paper  @xcite , spectral problem for the one - dimensional cauchy process ( that is , the symmetric @xmath3-stable process ) killed upon exiting a half - line or an interval was studied . for the half - line , an explicit formula for generalized eigenfunctions of transition operators",
    "was obtained using methods developed in the theory of linear water waves .",
    "the argument of  @xcite relies on some properties specific to the cauchy process , and it does not easily generalize to other lvy processes .",
    "the purpose of this article is to derive a similar formula for generalized eigenfunctions in a more general setting , using a modified method .",
    "the class of processes considered here consists of symmetric ( one - dimensional ) lvy processes @xmath4 with lvy measure having completely monotone density function on @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , this class can be described as ( one - dimensional ) subordinate brownian motions , corresponding to subordinators with lvy measure having completely monotone density function .",
    "yet another characterization is given by the condition that the lvy - khintchine exponent of @xmath4 has the form @xmath0 for a _ complete bernstein function _ @xmath5 .",
    "the equivalence of the above is given in proposition  [ prop : cbf ] .",
    "this class of lvy processes have attracted much attention in the last decade ; see , for example ,  @xcite for some recent developments .",
    "there is also an extensive literature focused specifically on symmetric @xmath6-stable processes ( @xcite ) and relativistic @xmath6-stable processes ( @xcite ) , which are included here as examples .",
    "we consider the process @xmath4 killed upon leaving the half - line @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the corresponding transition operators , the @xmath10 generator , and the domain of @xmath8 , respectively ( formal definitions are given in the preliminaries ) .",
    "the following generalization of theorem  2 from  @xcite is the main result of the article .",
    "its main advantage is the explicit description of the eigenfunctions .",
    "[ th : eigenfunctions ] suppose that the lvy - khintchine exponent of @xmath4 has the form @xmath0 for a complete bernstein function @xmath1 . for all @xmath11 ,",
    "there is a bounded function @xmath12 on @xmath13 which is the eigenfunction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 : for all @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath12 is characterized by its laplace transform : for @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath14 we have where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a bounded , completely monotone function on @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we have and @xmath19 is the laplace transform of a finite measure @xmath20 on @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath5 extends to a function @xmath21 holomorphic in the upper complex half - plane @xmath22 and continuous in @xmath23 , and furthermore @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , then the measure @xmath20 is absolutely continuous , and for @xmath25 .    in some cases , the above formulae can be substantially simplified .",
    "for example , when @xmath4 is the symmetric @xmath6-stable process , then @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ; see section  [ sec : examples ] .    any complete bernstein function @xmath5",
    "extends holomorphically to @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "hence , the assumption in the last part of theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] concerns the existence of boundary values of @xmath1 ( approached from the upper complex half - plane ) along the branch cut @xmath29 $ ] . a formula similar to",
    "can be given in the general case , as discussed in remark  [ rem : gamma ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that although theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] extends the result of  @xcite , its proof is essentially different .",
    "[ rem : anal ] entirely analytical formulation of theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] is available ; see  @xcite for the analytical definition of @xmath8 .",
    "also , our arguments are purely analytical , with the exception of probabilistic proofs of lemmas  [ lem : d2 ] and  [ lem : smooth : domain ] .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath12 _ never _ belong to @xmath30 : this reflects the fact that the spectrum of transition operators @xmath7 , considered as operators on @xmath30 , is purely continuous .",
    "nevertheless , the functions @xmath12 yield a _ generalized eigenfunction expansion _ of @xmath7 . in classical eigenfunction expansion ,",
    "a function is decomposed with respect to a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions , and the operator acts at each component independently .",
    "informally , in _ generalized _ eigenfunction expansions , the principle is the same , but eigenfunctions are no longer square - integrable and there are uncountably many of them . a formal statement is given in the following result , which generalizes theorem  3 in  @xcite , and explicitly provides functional calculus for @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath31 denote the @xmath30 generator of the semigroup @xmath7 , and the domain of @xmath8 , respectively ( again , see preliminaries for formal definitions ) .",

    "after a few months , this conjecture was solved in affirmative by jacek maecki , and the proof of injectivity of @xmath35 is given in the recent preprint  @xcite .",
    "we announce the result of  @xcite and state theorem  [ th : spectral ] in full generality .",
    "there is a striking similarity between formulae   and   on one hand , and some formulae in fluctuation theory of lvy processes on the other .",
    "more precisely , the exponent in   and   resembles known formulae for the laplace exponent of ladder processes ( see corollary  9.7 in  @xcite ) and the laplace transform of the supremum functional ( theorem  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily explained at the analytical level : in both cases explicit formulae are obtained using the _ wiener - hopf method _",
    ", a technique for solving some integral equations in the half - line via fourier transform . fluctuation theory of lvy processes relies upon the wiener - hopf factorization of the @xmath38-potential operator ( that is , the resolvent ) of the transition semigroup of a lvy process .",
    "the fourier symbol of this operator is @xmath39 . in the proof of theorem",
    "[ th : eigenfunctions ] , the operator with fourier symbol @xmath40 is factorized .",
    "a probabilistic formulation of the fluctuation theory is available through local times , excursion theory and ladder processes ; see  @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting open problem whether there is a similar _ probabilistic _ derivation of the formula for @xmath12 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th : spectral ] ( under the assumption that @xmath35 is injective ) follows the line of  @xcite .",
    "proofs of theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] are rather technical .",
    "therefore , it may be helpful to keep in mind the following well - recognized example .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is the brownian motion , with variance @xmath41 ( so that the generator of @xmath4 is the one - dimensional laplace operator @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath8 is the laplace operator in @xmath2 with dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath44 , and @xmath7 is the classical heat semigroup on @xmath13 with dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath8 and @xmath7 are simply @xmath45 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . the integral transform",
    "@xmath35 is the fourier sine transform on @xmath2 , and theorem  [ th : spectral ] states that the fourier sine transform is the unitary mapping ( up to a constant factor @xmath48 ) , which diagonalizes the action of the heat semigroup .    to the author s knowledge ,",
    "no results similar to theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] were available for lvy processes other than the brownian motion ( possibly with drift ; this requires a minor modification to the above example ) and the cauchy process ( studied in  @xcite ) .",
    "although generalized eigenfunction expansions similar to theorem  [ th : spectral ] have been studied for various classes of operators ( see  @xcite for the case of general markov processes , and  @xcite for diffusion processes with feynman - kac potential ) , the explicit description of eigenfunctions was not available .",
    "consequently , their applications were limited .",
    "the novelty of theorem  [ th : spectral ] is in that the generalized eigenfunctions @xmath49 are given in a fairly explicit form , allowing various estimates , asymptotic analysis and numerical approximation .",
    "for this reason , one can expect that theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] will find a variety of applications ; some are already discussed below .",
    "theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] yield formulae for the transition density @xmath50 of @xmath4 killed upon leaving the half - line @xmath2 , and for the distribution of the first exit time @xmath51 from the positive half - line .",
    "these results are contained in the following two theorems . by @xmath52",
    "we denote the probability for the process @xmath4 starting at a fixed point @xmath14 .",
    "[ th : pdt ] let @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 is integrable in @xmath25 , then    [ th : fpt ] let @xmath53 . if and then if @xmath55 is integrable in @xmath56 for all @xmath53 , then furthermore for @xmath57 .",
    "theorem  [ th : fpt ] in full generality is proved in the recent preprint  @xcite . in this article",
    "we provide a much simpler proof , under a more restrictive condition this condition implies both   and  , as well as integrability of @xmath55 ( see the proof of the theorem ) . the proof given below relies on theorem  [ th : spectral ]",

    "condition   is satisfied when @xmath1 is regularly varying of positive order at @xmath44 and at @xmath58 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the integrand in   has two oscillatory factors , and cancellations in the integral are essential .",
    "hence , formula   is problematic for numerical computations . for the cauchy process",
    ", a significant simplification of   is possible ( see theorem  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is an open problem whether formula   can be simplified in the more general case , even for symmetric @xmath6-stable processes for general @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "cancellation is of less importance in theorem  [ th : fpt ] ; see  @xcite , where   is used to obtain estimates for the density function of the distribution of @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath59 for all @xmath25 , the supremum in   is always not greater than @xmath60 ( see preliminaries ) .",
    "the assumptions   and   are rather mild regularity and growth conditions for @xmath5 ; examples are given in section  [ sec : examples ] .    by symmetry ,",
    "the first exit time @xmath51 for @xmath4 starting at @xmath14 has the same distribution as the first passage time @xmath61 through a barrier at @xmath62 for @xmath4 starting at @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "first passage times are related to the supremum functional : hence , theorem  [ th : fpt ] gives , in a rather general setting , an explicit expression for the distribution of first passage times and the supremum functional , which are fundamental objects in fluctuation theory of lvy processes .",
    "noteworthy , the double laplace transform ( in @xmath63 and @xmath62 ) of the distribution of @xmath61 is known for general lvy processes since 1957 ( theorem  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , explicit formulae for @xmath64 are known only in some special cases ; see  @xcite for some recent developments in this area .",
    "also , a formula for the single laplace transform ( in @xmath63 ) of @xmath65 for a large class of symmetric lvy processes was obtained only very recently in  @xcite .",
    "theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] can be applied to certain systems of pdes , related to traces of two - dimensional diffusions , as discussed in section  [ sec : applications ] . furthermore , there are at least four recent preprints exploiting the results of the present article .",
    "an application of theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] to the spectral theory of symmetric @xmath6-stable process in the interval can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the case of the relativistic @xmath3-stable process in half - line and interval is studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this application may be of particular interest in quantum physics ; see  @xcite for related research . in  @xcite ,",
    "theorems  [ th : eigenfunctions ] and  [ th : spectral ] are used to obtain refined semi - classical asymptotics for eigenvalues of higher - dimensional isotropic @xmath6-stable processes in domains .",
    "finally , the proof of theorems  [ th : spectral ] and  [ th : fpt ] in full generality , as well as their application to a detailed analysis of first passage times , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we conclude the introduction with a brief description of the structure of the article .",
    "the preliminaries section contains definitions and standard properties used in the article , and auxiliary lemmas .",
    "it includes some background on distribution theory , lvy processes and their generators , subordinate brownian motions and complete bernstein functions . in section  [ sec : cbf ] a certain transformation related to the wiener - hopf factorization is studied .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : eigenfunctions ] , we derive the formula for @xmath12 and prove theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] .",
    "theorems  [ th : spectral ] , [ th : pdt ] and  [ th : fpt ] are proved in section  [ sec : spectral ] .",
    "examples , including symmetric @xmath6-stable processes and relativistic @xmath6-stable processes , are studied in detail in section  [ sec : examples ] . in section  [ sec : applications ] we give an application of our results to systems of pdes ( theorem  [ th : pde ] ) .",
    "in the theory of partial differential equations , it is a common case that one first finds a weak solution to a problem , and then , by showing that the solution is sufficiently regular , one argues that it is in fact a strong solution .",
    "this approach will be used to prove theorem  [ th : eigenfunctions ] : first we find a distributional eigenfunction of @xmath8 , and then we show that in fact it belongs to the domain of @xmath8 .",
    "our argument relies heavily on fourier methods , and the operators involved are typically non - local , so the required background on distribution theory is slightly different from the one used in partial differential equations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the use of distributions could be avoided , at least partially , at the price of less clear exposition .",
    "however , the language of distribution theory seems to be well - suited for problems involving generators of killed lvy processes .",

    "below we recall some well - known properties of tempered distributions ; for a detailed exposition of the theory , see e.g.  @xcite .    if @xmath70 , the fourier transform of @xmath74 is @xmath75 . for @xmath71",

    "the above definition of @xmath120 extends the usual definition of the laplace transform of signed measures on @xmath94 .",

    "the exchange formula holds also for the laplace transform : if both @xmath81 are supported in @xmath94 , then they are @xmath69-convolvable and @xmath125 for all @xmath112 with @xmath16 .",

    "for this reason , in this and the next subsection , we work with the general case .",
