    "it shows a core source and lobes in the radio @xcite , which caused it to be one of the first sources referred to as a `` microquasar '' .",
    "the spectrum of  is generally a power law ( with an exponential cutoff beginning around 100 kev ) , occasionally with a weak thermal component @xcite .",
    "weekly observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) @xcite on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) show that the power - law index can vary from about 1.5 to 2.5 , that the hard x - ray luminosity is always dominated by the power law , and that the variability before 2001 ( figure 1 ) was not extreme @xcite .",
    "earlier observations by",
    "_ granat / sigma at 40 - 150 kev showed the source below detection level in fall 1991 and spring 1992 @xcite , and therefore more than an order of magnitude fainter than its typical _ granat and _ rxte luminosity .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory also saw the 20 - 100 kev flux from  vary dramatically @xcite .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    s spectral variations are not simultaneous with variations in its luminosity , a newly - discovered characteristic which it shares with  @xcite . in , the usual prototype of a bhc system , there is a clearly defined progression from the hard to soft state : the 2 - 10 kev flux increases dramatically as the spectrum softens , the total x - ray luminosity increasing only slightly @xcite .",
    "the softening takes two forms : the index of the power law softens while at the same time the thermal component brightens and goes to higher temperature . in the transition back to the hard state ,",
    "the spectrum and luminosity also vary simultaneously .    and ,",
    "in contrast , tend to be softest not when the 2 - 10 kev flux is highest , but rather when the derivative of that count rate is most negative @xcite .",
    "we interpreted this behavior in terms of a model by @xcite in which bhc accretion operates in two decoupled flows , a classical thin disk which produces thermal emission and a nearly spherical , sub - keplerian flow ( `` halo '' hereafter ) which scatters the thermal photons into the cut - off power law .",
    "if mass transfer from the companion suddenly dropped , altering both flows at large radii , the change would propagate at the free - fall timescale in the halo , but at the much slower viscous timescale in the thin disk .",
    "therefore , there would temporarily be an imbalance : the same number of soft disk photons , but fewer hot halo electrons to scatter them .",
    "fewer scatters per photon softens the power law and , in addition , the thinner halo would be more easily cooled by the disk photons . in @xcite",
    "we dubbed this a `` dynamical '' soft state and hypothesized that it was responsible for almost all the softening events observed in  and , except for a brief period in fall of 2000 when  was at its brightest and seemed on the verge of entering a true ( `` static '' ) soft state in which the halo self - cools and collapses .    in this letter",
    "we report on the recent transition of  to the soft state , and interpret the data in terms of the dynamical soft state model .",
    "pca snapshots of 1500 s were taken monthly of  in 1996 , weekly through 2000 , and are being taken twice weekly from march 2001 .",
    "there are no pointings for a period from november to january each year due to a sun - angle constraint on pointing .",
    "figure 1 shows the count rate as a function of time in two energy bands : 2.5 - 4.0 kev and 10.0 - 25.0 kev .",
    "instrumental background and background due to galactic plane diffuse emission @xcite have been subtracted .",
    "the source is kept off - axis to prevent contamination from gx 5 - 1 nearby .",
    "all results below use data from layer 1 of the pca only .",
    "the data were analyzed with version 5.0.4 of heasoft .",
    "there was a precipitous drop above 10 kev in late february of 2001 ( figure 1 ) , but not in the soft band @xcite .",
    "on march 12 - 13 , 31 ksec of public observations were made with _",
    "rxte in three separate intervals .",
    "since the new soft state would have been undetectable to sigma , it is quite possible that this was the state that instrument observed in 1991 - 1992 . _",
    "figure 2 shows the pca spectrum of the combined march 12 - 13 data , including the residuals from a fit to a power law plus a blackbody . because the pca fits begin at 3 kev , the fitted hydrogen absorption column and blackbody intensity",
    "are strongly correlated and ca nt both be determined well .",
    "we therefore fixed the column at the asca value @xcite : 1.5 @xmath0 atoms @xmath1 .",
    "the fitted blackbody temperature was ( 0.395 @xmath2 0.006 ) kev and the power - law photon index was ( 2.89 @xmath2 0.12 ) . using a multicolor disk blackbody , the maximum temperature was ( 0.464 @xmath2 0.007 ) kev and the power law index ( 2.75 @xmath2 0.12 ) .",
    "the blackbody luminosity ( @xmath3 ergs @xmath1s@xmath4 , or @xmath5 ergs s@xmath4 at 8.5 kpc ) is the highest seen with _ rxte , although only about 35% higher than in some spectra from near the peak in the top panel of figure 1 in late 2000 .",
    "_    as is apparent from the residuals in figure 2 , the addition of an iron k - shell line improves the fit . fixing the energy at 6.7 kev and the width at 0.1 kev ( narrower than the pca resolution ) ,",
    "the derived equivalent width is 300 ev for both the blackbody and disk blackbody models .",
    "the interpretation of a weak , instrumentally broad line near the crossover point of two continuum components is problematic , and we do not claim this as a certain detection .",
    "no significant improvement in @xmath6 resulted from letting the energy or width of the line vary .",
    "figure 3 shows the fits to the monitoring observations in early 2001 , before and after the state transition .",
    "the first observation of 2001 ( january 23 , labeled `` a '' in figure 3 ) displays both a bright power law and a significant blackbody peak ( this is also occasionally seen at other periods from 1996 - 2000 ) .",
    "the soft excess from 1.0 - 2.4 kev measured by @xcite with rosat in 1994 was 2.8@xmath7 ergs @xmath1s@xmath4 , about half the value for this spectrum ( 5.7@xmath7 ergs @xmath1s@xmath4 from 1.0 - 2.4 kev , or 7.0@xmath7 ergs @xmath1s@xmath4 bolometric ) .",
    "the remaining spectra before the transition have no detectable blackbody and a harder power - law index .",
    "the first spectrum after the transition ( labeled `` c '' ) has somewhat more of a residual power - law tail than the spectra after it .",
    "figure 4a shows a combined lightcurve around the time of the transition , using data from two sources : the monitoring campaign discussed above , and a second _ rxte campaign of twice - weekly scans of the whole galactic - bulge region @xcite . for each scan ,",
    "the data are fitted to a model of point sources and diffuse emission .",
    "one scan point on february 20 implies that the source may have dropped to a low level in less than 3.9 dy and then rebounded completely less than 11.3 hr later .",
    "generally speaking the pointed observations and bulge - scan intensities agree to within @xmath8",
    ". however , the proximity of  to the bright source gx  51 may potentially introduce unmodelled systematic errors into the scan data .",
    "_    figure 4b shows the evolution of the root mean square ( rms ) variability beyond poisson noise . as is typical for bhc soft states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the variability drops dramatically .",
    "the last data point represents all the deep - pointing data from march 12 - 13 . at this time",
    "the rms variability ( 0.004 - 16 hz , 2 - 10 kev ) was consistent with zero , with a 3@xmath9 upper limit of 2.5% .",
    "there are similarities and differences between this hard - to - soft transition and transitions in other bhcs .",
    "one of the best - monitored transitions was in  in 1996 .",
    "the 1.3 - 200 kev luminosity as measured by the _",
    "rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) and batse , corrected for interstellar absorption , jumped upwards by about 35% @xcite .",
    "to compare , we extrapolated our spectral fits to this energy range and removed the interstellar absorption using the fixed column density discussed above .  and",
    "other bhcs have an exponential cutoff in the hard state beyond the pca range , and we used cutoff parameters from a deep _ rxte pointing to  in 1996 @xcite .",
    "we find that the extrapolated 1.3 - 200 kev luminosity of  dropped in the hard - to - soft transition by about the same amount that it rose in  in 1996 .",
    "_ _    that soft state in , however , was not typical of bhc soft states in general .",
    "the power - law flux at 25 kev dropped only by a factor of 3 from the hard state @xcite compared to the factor of 50 apparent in figure 3 , and there was still 20% rms of fast variability @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that this `` soft '' state should have been called an `` intermediate '' state .",
    "if the hard / intermediate / soft progression is a monotonic increase in accretion rate as generally thought , one would expect that the more `` complete '' transition in  would result in an even larger increase in luminosity , not a decrease .    entered the soft state in 1990 and 1998 with similar spectral and timing characteristics to the new soft state in . between april and august of 1990 ,",
    "the power - law tail in  dropped by at least an order of magnitude at 10 kev and the rms variability in the soft state was only ( 6.1 @xmath2 2.7)% @xcite . for the 1998 transition ,",
    "@xcite compared the 2.5 - 20 kev unabsorbed flux in the soft state to data taken in the hard state several months previously .",
    "they found that the total flux in this band increased by about a factor of two .",
    "we can evaluate our pca data in this band without extrapolation .",
    "we find again that , contrary to the behavior of the other bhc ,  saw a decrease in absorption - corrected flux in the energy band chosen for comparison , in this case a drop of a factor of 3.3 from 2.5 - 20 kev between february 21 and march 2 .",
    "batse was the first to observe a soft state in , with a power law index of -2.6 from 20 - 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the soft spectrum crossed the usual harder spectrum at 20 kev , so again there would have been an increase rather than a drop in the power - law component over the 3 - 25 kev band .    while the transitions in , , and other bhcs are probably indeed caused by an increase in accretion causing self - cooling and partial collapse of the halo ( static soft state ) , we suggest that this transition in  is instead caused by the sudden shutoff of all , or nearly all , of the mass transfer from the compact object s companion .",
    "this is the extreme instance of the dynamical soft state described in @xcite .",
    "given the hypothesis @xcite that the disk and halo flows are independently fed directly from the companion , the halo would then vanish immediately leaving the disk to decay away on a viscous timescale on the order of a month or more @xcite .",
    "we would nt expect  to show a dynamical soft state , because as a wind accretor its disk is expected to be small , and therefore have a short viscous time @xcite .",
    "it is possible that , beneath the halo , the disk emission was more or less constant throughout early 2001 , and when it was nt seen , the halo was optically thick . in the first spectrum of the year",
    "( `` a '' in figure 3 ) , with a blackbody luminosity about a factor of 4 below the naked disk , the optical depth of the halo would then have been near unity .",
    "the changes in the slope of the power law support this interpretation : the slope is hardest when the halo is assumed to be thickest , and repeated scatterings should produce a harder power law @xcite . if the apparent drop on february 20 ( figure 4a ) is genuine , then the time for the halo to re - establish itself would be less than 11.3 hr , which is still longer than the free - fall time from the outer disk .",
    "viewing the disk and halo flows as independent , and assuming that the disk flow did not change as the halo disappeared , the loss of fast variability in the transition implies that the flickering commonly observed in the hard state of bhcs is either intrinsic to the halo flow alone , or else due to an interaction at the boundary between the dense , radially slow - moving disk and the thin , radially fast - moving halo .    when the transition to the soft state occurred , we predicted @xcite , based on the dynamical picture and the disk timescales we previously derived @xcite , that mass transfer from the companion had stopped and the soft - state emission would decay away with a timescale of a few weeks . figure 5 shows the flux ( uncorrected for absorption ) from 3 - 25 kev as a function of time starting with the first soft - state spectrum ( february 27 ) to the most recent data available ( april 15 ) .",
    "the shape is neither exponential or linear , but somewhere in between .",
    "the best fit exponential gives a ( 27.9 @xmath2 1.7 ) dy time constant .",
    "the latest fluxes approach the limit of the systematic uncertainty in the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "if there is still a small mass transfer from the companion , the spectrum may eventually make a transition to the pure , very faint hard power law seen in  in its lowest luminosity ( `` off '' ) state @xcite .",
    "observations of  were never taken immediately following the drop from higher fluxes , and it may show a dynamical soft state at those times . eventually , our understanding of the state change in  may apply to the state changes in the soft x - ray transients ( the outbursts of the more numerous bhcs without persistent emission ) , which can show hysteresis with a hard - to - soft transition near peak flux followed by a much later soft - to - hard transition at much lower flux @xcite ."
