    "it is conjectured that the expansion of our universe is accelerating .",
    "recent observations provide strong evidence of this acceleration .",
    "the explanation of this remarkable phenomenon is rather difficult : one needs a dark energy field with an effectively negative pressure , @xmath2 . from several independent observational data",
    ", one finds @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for the energy densities of matter and dark energy respectively with respect to the critical ones @xcite .",
    "we should live now in the cosmological constant dominated era ( and approximately flat , @xmath7 ) , while at earlier times there was a radiation and matter dominated era .",
    "there are some fundamental questions .",
    "first , will the acceleration last forever .",
    "secondly , why there is the huge discrepancy between @xmath8 in planck units and vacuum energy density @xmath9 which is @xmath10 times greater than the value we need to accelerate the expansion of the universe .",
    "thirdly , the value must be incredibly fine - tuned , @xmath11 .",
    "so it would be a logical step to try to explain the late - time acceleration without the need for dark energy @xcite .",
    "it is also conjectured that one needs an inflaton field in the very early stage of our universe , to solve the flatness and horizon problem in the standard model of cosmology .",
    "this is the inflationary cold dark matter model with cosmological constant ( @xmath12cdm ) .",
    "it could also predict the existence of fluctuations we observe in the cmb shortly before the end of inflation .",
    "the inflaton - field could be the well - known scalar - higgs field with the mexican - hat potential .",
    "this model has lived up to its reputation .",
    "it was successful in the explanation of superconductivity , i.e. , the ginsburg - landau theory , in the standard model of particle physics , in the general relativistic solution of the self - gravitating nielsen - olesen vortex ( cosmic string ) @xcite and could play a fundamental role in warped spacetimes @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings are u(1 ) scalar - gauge vortex solutions in general relativity ( gr)@xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that in any field theory which admits cosmic strings , a network of strings inevitably forms at some point during the early universe .",
    "however it is doubtful if they persist to the present time .",
    "evidence of these objects would give us information at very high energies in the early stages of the universe .",
    "from recent observations by cobe , wmap and planck satellites , it was concluded that cosmic strings can not provide satisfactory explanation for the magnitude of the initial density perturbations from which galaxies and clusters grew .",
    "the interest in cosmic strings faded away , mainly because of the inconsistencies with the power spectrum of cmb .",
    "cosmological cosmic strings can also be investigated on a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background . however , the string - cosmology spacetime essentially looks like a scaled version of a string in a vacuum spacetime and the corrections in the field equations due to cylindrical gravitational radiation are rapidly damped and are negligible in any physical regime @xcite .",
    "the reason of this result comes from the notion that the string radius @xmath13 is much smaller than the hubble radius @xmath14 in the post - inflationary era .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the factored out overall scale factor in the metric , is then of the order @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting field equations look like the generalized nielsen - olesen vortex system . only in the pre - inflationary epoch ,",
    "radiative corrections could be very large .",
    "while the inflaton field plays a crucial role in the early stage of our universe , it could play a comparable role at much later times , if we modify gravity by considering warped brane - world models .",
    "it could be possible that there exists a correlation between the accelerating universe and large extra dimensions in brane - world models .",
    "when it was realized that cosmic strings could be produced within the framework of superstring theory inspired cosmological models , a revival of cosmic strings occurred .",
    "these so - called cosmic superstrings can play the role of cosmic strings in the framework of string theory or m - theory , i.e. , brane - world models .",
    "supersymmetric gut s can even demand the existence of cosmic strings .",
    "physicists speculate that extra spatial dimensions could exist in addition to our ordinary 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the idea that spacetime could have more than four dimensions was first proposed by kaluza and klein ( kk ) in the early 20@xmath18 century @xcite .",
    "these theories can be used to explain several of the shortcomings of the standard model , i.e. , the unknown origin of dark energy and dark matter and the weakness of gravity ( hierarchy problem ) . in these models",
    ", the weakness of gravity might be fundamental .",
    "one might naively imagine that these extra dimensions must be very small , i.e. , curled up and never observable .",
    "super - massive strings with @xmath19 , could be produced when the universe underwent phase transitions at energies much higher than the gut scale .",
    "recently there is growing interest in the so - called brane - world models , first proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite and i. antoniadis et al .",
    "@xcite , which was extended by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite . in these models",
    ", the extra dimension can be very large compared to the ones predicted in string theory , i.e. , of order of millimeters .",
    "the difference with the standard superstring model is that the compactification rely on the curvature of the bulk .",
    "the huge discrepancy between the electro - weak scale , @xmath20 and the gravitational mass scale @xmath21 will be suppressed by the volume of the extra dimension @xmath22 , or the curvature in that region .",
    "this effect can also be achieved in the rs models by a warpfactor . in the rs-2 model",
    ", there are two branes , the visible and the gravity brane at @xmath23 .",
    "the branes have equal and opposite tensions @xmath24 . at low energy ,",
    "a negative bulk cosmological constant will prevent gravity to leak into the extra dimension , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the corresponding energy scale and @xmath27 the compactification radius .",
    "the @xmath28 squeeze the gravitational field closer to the brane at @xmath23 . in the rs1 model ,",
    "one pushes the negative tension brane @xmath29 .",
    "if one fine - tunes the @xmath30 , then this ensures a zero effective cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "the infinite extra dimension makes , however , a finite contribution to the 5d volume due to the warpfactor .",
    "because of the finite separation of the branes in the rs-2 model , one obtains so - called effective 4d modes ( kk - modes ) of the perturbative 5d graviton on the 4d brane .",
    "these kk - modes will be massive from the brane viewpoint . in the rs-1 model",
    ", the discrete spectrum disappears and will form a continuous spectrum @xcite .    it will be clear that compact objects , such as black holes and cosmic strings , could have tremendous mass in the bulk , while their warped manifestations in the brane can be consistent with observations .",
    "so , brane - world models could overcome the observational bounds one encounters in cosmic string models .",
    "@xmath31 could be warped down to gut scale , even if its value was at the planck scale .",
    "although static solutions of the u(1 ) gauge string on a warped spacetime show significant deviation from the classical solution in 4d @xcite , one is interested in the dynamical evolution of the effective brane equations .",
    "wavelike disturbances triggered by the huge mass of the cosmic string in the bulk , could have observational effects in the brane .",
    "one conjectures that these disturbances could act as an effective dark energy field .",
    "the question is if the pulse - like cylindrical waves have the desired asymptotic behavior at null infinity .    here",
    ", we will investigate the late - time evolution of a warped 5d flrw model when a u(1 ) scalar field coupled to a gauge field is present . in section ii",
    ", we outline the model and in section iii , we present some numerical solutions of the model . finally , we have summarized our results in section iv .",
    "in order to embed a cosmological cosmic string in a flrw model , one has to modify the metric .",
    "the spacetime of a cosmic string is invariant under boosts in the @xmath32 direction , whereas the flrw spacetime is not .",
    "gregory@xcite pointed out that in the static case , if the radius of the string core is small compared to the hubble radius @xmath14 , the embedding is easily done . for a non - static radiating cylindrically symmetric spacetime",
    ", one can analyze the behavior of gravitational waves generated by the local strings on the expansion of the universe if we consider the zero - thickness limit of non - singular spacetimes containing a cylindrical distribution of stress - energy embedded on a cosmological background .",
    "the importance of cylindrical symmetric gravitational waves was first noticed by beck @xcite and rediscovered by einstein and rosen ( er)@xcite . a substantial part of the present knowledge on gravitational waves originated from their wavelike solutions of the fully non - linear gravitational field equations .",
    "however , these original er cylindrical wave solutions of the einstein s vacuum field equations inhabit a universe that is conical rather than flat at infinite cylindrical radius@xcite . to overcome this problem",
    ", one could impose artificially non - conicality constraints@xcite in order to obtain a kasner - like spacetime . in a warped 5-dimensional brane - world model with a u(1 ) gauge cosmic string ,",
    "these constraints are superfluous because the effective brane spacetime is non - conical@xcite .",
    "much insight into wavelike solutions on a cylindrically spacetime can also be obtained from well known stationary axially symmetric solutions , like the weyl , papapetrou , lewis - van stockum , and kerr solution , through a complex transformation @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical symmetric metric is ( with two killing vectors @xmath34 , both spacelike and hypersurface orthogonal ) @xmath35 without any matter source , one then obtains a wave equation for @xmath36 , which is decoupled from @xmath37 .",
    "once @xmath36 is solved , @xmath37 can be solved by quadratures and the behavior of @xmath36 and @xmath37 at null infinity is well known , i.e. , the einstein - rosen pulse waves .",
    "one can construct incoming and outgoing radiation solutions @xcite in terms of the retarded and advanced coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for a non - vacuum situation",
    ", the equations will not decouple .",
    "it was found by gregory @xcite that a u(1 ) cosmic string can be embedded into a flat flrw spacetime along the polar axis , when the hubble radius is much larger than the string - core .",

    "one should also like to impose matching conditions across the boundary @xmath13 of the interior and exterior spacetime ( although for radiating strings , this will be difficult ) .",
    "for late - time solutions , it is not necessary to consider the matching conditions between the interior string solutions and the exterior flrw spacetime .",
    "it turns out that when the width of the strings @xmath13 is smaller than the hubble radius , the disturbances are neglectable @xcite .    on a warped spacetime , where the warpfactor has a significant effect on the cosmic string solution @xcite",

    "the same arguments hold for the pure scalar term @xmath149 .",
    "however , it does nt contain the warpfactor .    in figure 2",
    "we also plotted the c - energy @xmath150 ( abbreviation for `` cylindrical '' energy introduced by thorne@xcite ) , the brown - york quasi - local c - energy @xmath151@xcite and the advanced and retarded c - energy flow along the two null - directions , ( @xmath152 ) and ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "the c - energy was originally introduced by thorne as a very useful tool in analyzing the dynamics of a whole - cylinder - symmetric system ( i.e. , cylindrical symmetry with hyper - surface orthogonal killing fields ) and to describe the nature of einstein - rosen gravitational waves and electro - magnetic waves .",
    "it was useful to demonstrate the resistance of magnetic - field lines to cylindrically gravitational collapse and to discuss the dynamics of melvin s magnetic universe when large radial perturbations are introduced@xcite .",
    "evidence for a bona fide `` energy '' status of @xmath37 is the fact that its coordinate gradient is related to a flux vector field which is covariantly conserved@xcite .",
    "it was found that the brown - york quasi - local c - energy description is a better measure of the c - energy than the original one of thorne .",
    "@xmath154 is derived by means of a hamiltonian reduction of the field equations , wherein the @xmath154-energy arises naturally from the hamiltonian constraint , while thorne s arguments were merely heuristic .",
    "another argument for the choice of @xmath154 is the fact that the asymptotic metric in the vacuum case can be written in the form @xmath155 with @xmath156 the asymptotic value for @xmath157 .",
    "this can be seen by the re - scaling @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 in the asymptotic form of metric of ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "this metric is exactly the metric exterior to a cosmic string with mass per unit length @xmath161 .",
    "this is only valid in the weak - field limit @xmath162 . because @xmath37 does nt decouple from the equation for @xmath36 , we have two degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for the gravitational waves ( in the einstein - rosen case there is one degree of freedom , because @xmath37 can be obtained by quadrature when @xmath36 is known ) .",
    "further we have the warpfactor @xmath87 as extra metric component .",
    "it turns out that the wavelike behavior depends critically on the ratio of the scalar to gauge masses , @xmath163 .",
    "we took @xmath164 . for @xmath165",
    "one obtains the features of a global string , which is in general singular@xcite . from the plots of figure 2 we can draw some global conclusions concerning regular behavior , the interaction of de cosmic string with the gravitational waves and the deviation from the 4d flrw counterpart model ( with the same matter field and cylindrical symmetry ) .",
    "the c - energy is radiated along the null directions in agreement with other research on cylindrical symmetric spacetimes .",
    "although our numerical code runs out of accuracy for larger r and t values , we observe a fall - off of the weber - wheeler pulse @xmath166 .",
    "the induced disturbances in the scalar field x travel backwards closer to the axes of the cosmic string and the scalar field returns to its original static form with its core closer to r=0 .",
    "some remarks must be made with regards to the asymptotic behavior of the metric eq.([eqn26 ] ) . if we define @xmath167 , then the metric eq.([eqn26 ] )",
    "becomes minkowski .",
    "however , @xmath168 now takes the values @xmath169 .",
    "so if @xmath170 , we obtain a angle deficit and the spacetime is conical .",
    "because @xmath156 is related to the metric component @xmath171@xcite , we can plot this angle deficit residue @xmath130 and compare its behavior with the 4d counterpart model of gregory@xcite . in the static 4d case , so in the absence of radiation , the angle deficit for isolated strings at large radial distances is related to the mass per unit length @xmath26 of the cosmic string , i.e. , @xmath172 . in the weak field approximation one",
    "has @xmath173 .",
    "so for gut strings ( @xmath174 ) we expect that the asymptotic behavior is practically minkowski minus a wedge .",
    "the angle deficit will also depend on @xmath146 . a typical value for the angle deficit is @xmath175 for @xmath176@xcite .",
    "if one admits radiative effects on the 4d time - dependent spacetime , one proves@xcite that the string - cosmology spacetime essentially looks like a scaled version of a cosmic string solution , not desirable ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn26 ] ) ) because we live now in a flat flrw spacetime . in deriving this result",
    ", one makes the simplification that the gravitational wave energy decouples from the cosmic string energy .",
    "the energy of the string is then exponentially damped and one finds that asymptotically @xmath130 remains constant for all time . in our 5d warped model , we made no simplifications , because we solved the full set of coupled wave equations numerically",
    ". moreover , we have the contribution from the bulk as explained in section ( 2.2 ) .",
    "we observe from figure 2 that @xmath130 increases with time .",
    "one can prove@xcite , that for increasing @xmath130 , the angle deficit becomes @xmath177 and one deals with a kasner - like spacetime .",
    "so we conclude that in our warped cosmological model we do nt deal with a scaled version of the standard cosmic string .",
    "the notion of a conical spacetime fades away on our effective @xmath178 spacetime . for values of @xmath179 above the gut scale , gravitational effects become more relevant and the weak - field approximation can no longer be applied .",
    "these so - called supermassive cosmic strings possess in 4d , however , a curvature singularity@xcite .",
    "moreover , they probably would have formed before an inflationary era and subsequently inflated away . in our warped 5d spacetime",
    "these supermassive cosmic strings arise in a different manner , i.e. , by the warpfactor .",
    "we can also compare the plots of @xmath180 and @xmath124 of figure 2 , in order to draw some conclusions about the asymptotic conical behavior .",
    "the metric component @xmath181 approaches in the classical 4d cosmic string solution to the value @xmath182 , so in the weak field approximation one expects asymptotically that @xmath183 approaches a constant value and @xmath181 will show a small deviation from @xmath184 .",
    "this constant value is dependent of the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath61 of the model .",
    "however not in our case .",
    "we observe that the warped counterpart metric component @xmath186 behavior is different : it increases for larger values of r and t and seems to be insensitive for the values @xmath185 and @xmath61 .",
    "so we observe no conical behavior .",
    "this absence of the angle deficit in a 5 dimensional warped cosmic string model was also found earlier@xcite .",
    "if one investigate the brane evolution via the modified second friedmann equations , then on the right - hand side new terms will appear which contain @xmath87 , the quadratic contribution of the energy - momentum tensor ( see eq.([eqn22 ] ) and ( [ eqn23 ] ) ) and a bulk radiation term containing the constants @xmath86 and @xmath187 ( see eq.([eqn7 ] ) and eq.([eqn10 ] ) ) . from the behavior of @xmath87 of figure 1 and the occurrence of @xmath87 in the denominator of the evolution equation eq.([eqn22])of @xmath37",
    "one could conclude that an ever lasting exponential expansion is preferable over the other possibilities .",
    "the dependency of our model on the several ( integration- ) constants is currently under investigation by the authors .",
    "the late - time epoch of accelerated expansion can be explained within the framework of the 4d standard model of cosmology by hypothesizing a dark energy component to the total energy density of the universe with negative pressure equation of state @xmath188 , where the equation of state parameter w lies near -1 .",
    "dark energy can possibly be understood as arising from vacuum energy , but this explanation introduces the cosmological constant problem .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that there is no dark energy , but instead a low - energy / large scale ( i.e. , `` infrared '' ) modification to general relativity that accounts for late - time acceleration , schematically , @xmath189 .",
    "the higher dimensional graviton has massive 4d modes felt on the brane ( kk modes ) . gravity leakage from the 4d brane can cause this self - acceleration without the need to introduce dark energy .",
    "we find a significant new late - time behavior of the warped 5d flrw cosmological model , when a self - gravitating u(1 ) scalar field coupled to a gauge field ( cosmic string ) is present on the brane and the effective cosmological constant on the brane is zero ( rs fine - tuning ) . compared with the 4d counterpart model ,",
    "the cylindrically symmetric disturbances have a significant impact on the late - time expansion rate of the universe .",
    "this is caused by the fact that one has no bound on the mass per unit length of the cosmic string , in contrast to the 4d model of gregory @xcite .",
    "we find an exact solution for the warpfactor , @xmath190 .",
    "the time - dependent part , which plays the role of a `` scale '' factor , is a monotone exponential increasing function with an inflection point or has a extremum . in the latter case ,",
    "the metric component @xmath37 becomes singular at the moment the warp factor develops a extremum .",
    "this behavior could have influence on the possibility of a transition from acceleration to deceleration or vice versa .",
    "in the first case the accelerated expansion can be accomplished without the need of an effective brane cosmological constant as dark energy .",
    "the disturbances of the scalar and gauge fields interact with gravitational waves and could act as an effective dark energy field and trigger brane fluctuations .",
    "the scalar field sheds off wave energy and the oscillations slowly decay and eventually the variables return to their static values .",
    "the recently found large - scale alignment of quasar polarizations in our universe@xcite could be explained by our model .",
    "the modified energy momentum tensor component @xmath191 induces traveling waves in the z - direction on the brane .",
