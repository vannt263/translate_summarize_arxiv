    "many realistic extensions of the standard model predict the existence of _ light pseudoscalar bosons _ ( lpbs ) described by the effective lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the lpb field , @xmath3 is the two - photon inverse coupling constant ( with the dimension of an energy ) , @xmath4 is the usual electromagnetic field strength ( @xmath5 is its dual ) and natural lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath6 are adopted .",
    "a well - known example of lpb is the _ axion _",
    "@xcite , whose mass @xmath7 is given by the approximate relation @xmath8",
    "@xcite . however , @xmath7 and @xmath3 are to be regarded as independent parameters as long as generic lpbs are concerned  @xcite .",
    "owing to the characteristic two - photon coupling in lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) , photon - lpb conversion takes place whenever an external magnetic field is present .",
    "this fact implies that the vacuum acquires nontrivial optical properties , much in the same way as it happens for the qed magnetized vacuum  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the exchange of _ virtual _ lpbs gives rise to _ birefringence _ , while the production of _ real _ lpbs is responsible for _ dichroism_. therefore , when a light beam with initial _ linear _ polarization travels in a magnetized vacuum an _ elliptical _ polarization shows up , with the ellipse s major axis _ rotated _ with respect to the initial polarization .",
    "quite remarkably , a measurement of the resulting beam ellipticity and rotation angle permits a _",
    "complete _ determination of @xmath7 and @xmath3 , provided of course that the lpb contribution dominates over the qed one .",
    "thus , the unique opportunity arises to detect lpbs by means of high - precision optics experiments , as first pointed out by maiani , petronzio and zavattini  @xcite .",
    "recently , the pvlas collaboration has reported positive evidence for an anomalously large value of the rotation angle in an initially linearly - polarized laser beam undergoing multiple reflection in a @xmath9 magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "also the beam ellipticity has been determined on the basis of a previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the effect is indeed due to a lpb , the corresponding physical parameters turn out to lie in the range @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , a new measurement of the beam ellipticity leads to the preferred values @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", preliminary evidence  @xcite tends to favour a scalar rather than a pseudoscalar boson , thereby requiring the last term in lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) to be replaced by @xmath14 .",
    "yet , all considerations to follow basically hold true in both cases , and so we shall focus on lpbs for definiteness .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "a look back at the above @xmath15 relation shows that the lpb in question _ can not _ be the axion .",
    "in addition , the inferred value of @xmath3 _ violates _ both the theoretical astrophysical bound  @xcite and the cast result  @xcite by about five orders of magnitudes .",
    "such a conflict can be avoided in two ways .",
    "a possibility is that lpbs produced in the central region of a star are effectively confined inside the interiors in a manner consistent with the observed properties  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the produced lpb flux can be drastically reduced in a stellar environment  @xcite . in either case , _ new physics _ at very low energy",
    "is required .",
    "all this makes the need for _ independent _ tests of the pvlas result even more compelling .",
    "remarkably enough , high - precision astronomical observations of the double pulsar j0737 - 3039 can compete successfully with laboratory experiments in providing independent evidence for or against the pvlas claim .",
    "indeed , we will shown that photon - lpb conversion in such a system gives rise to a characteristic attenuation pattern of the light beam emitted by one of the pulsars when it goes through the magnetosphere of the companion .",
    "for the values of @xmath7 and @xmath3 determined by pvlas , the production of lpbs turns out to be substantial , so that the resulting attenuation of the beam intensity can become observable in the @xmath0-ray band with the upcoming glast mission  @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling a few facts about j0737 - 3039  @xcite .",
    "this is a double pulsar system , with an orbital period of 2.45 hr .",
    "both components  referred to as @xmath16 and @xmath17  rotate , with spin period of 23 ms and 2.77 s , respectively .",
    "what makes j0737 - 3039 particularly well suited for our purposes is the high inclination of its orbital plane , so that it is seen almost edge - on .",
    "consider now the light beam emitted by pulsar @xmath16 , and denote by @xmath18 its impact parameter , namely its projected distance from pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "every 2.45 hr @xmath18 attains its minimum value @xmath19 and the light beam in question traverses the magnetosphere of pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "when this happens , the beam propagation is strongly affected by such a highly nontrivial environment . although the current value of @xmath19 is somewhat uncertain , an estimate  @xcite yields @xmath20 and this is the value used in our analysis .",
    "we compute the probability for photon - lpb conversion @xmath21 by numerically integrating the propagation equation  @xcite for a beam emitted by pulsar @xmath16 and travelling in the dipolar magnetic field of pulsar @xmath17 ( plasma effects turn out to be totally negligible ) .",
    "we plot @xmath21 versus photon energy @xmath22 in fig .",
    "1 , for the beam impact parameter @xmath23 .",
    "transition probability versus photon energy for a trajectory of the light beam with an impact parameter @xmath24 km.,width=302 ]    we see that photon - lpb conversion turns out to be important for @xmath25 , namely in the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "this is a remarkable conclusion , since pulsar @xmath16 in j0737 - 3039 is expected to be a @xmath0-ray source .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0-ray photons propagate totally unimpeded in the magnetosphere of pulsar @xmath17 , and so we do not have to bother about further potential sources of beam attenuation ( photo - pair production is totally negligible ) .    as a matter of fact , the temporal behaviour of the considered effect is best expressed in terms of the total _",
    "@xmath26 of the beam after propagation in the magnetosphere of pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "we plot @xmath16 versus time in fig .",
    "2 , as pulsar @xmath16 moves in its nearly edge - on orbit .",
    "total transmisson of the gamma photon beam emitted by pulsar @xmath16 versus time .",
    "inset shows the modulation mainly due to the rotation of the magnetic dipole moment of pulsar @xmath17.,width=302 ]    our numerical simulation predicts a strong attenuation of the photon beam up to @xmath27 with a time duration of about @xmath28 s. as it is clear from fig .",
    "2 , this effect has three different temporal structures . the broad minimum  from @xmath29",
    "s to @xmath30 s  evidently corresponds to the transit of pulsar @xmath16 behind pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "the tens - of - seconds , symmetric peaks are due to photon - lpb oscillations , depending on the actual path through the interaction region with pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the highest frequency modulation  shown in inset  is due to the rotation of the magnetic dipole moment of pulsar @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "3 the region of the @xmath15 parameter plane excluded by the no detection of an attenuation @xmath16 at the @xmath31 level .",
    "such an attenuation is achieved by a 100 photon count during the total integration time .",
    "for a two weeks observation time , this corresponds to a flux from pulsar @xmath16 of about @xmath32 photons/@xmath33/s , which is a reasonable flux according to previous observations of several pulsars . as a matter of fact , the glast sensitivity curves allow for a much weaker minimum detectable flux , down to @xmath34 photons/@xmath33/s .    thus , we conclude that the photon - lpb conversion mechanism in the double pulsar j0737 - 3039 really provides a cross - check for the recent pvlas claim about the existence of a new lpb .",
    "we stress that our result would remain practically unchanged even if we were considering a light _",
    "scalar _ boson .",
