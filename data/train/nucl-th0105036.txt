    "<S> using a relativistic transport model for heavy ion collisions at energies that are below the threshold for kaon and antikaon production in nucleon - nucleon collisions , we study how their abundances approach the canonical equilibrium during the collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that kaons are far from chemical equilibrium at the initial and high density stage , and they approach equilibrium only during the expansion stage of the collisions when their production rate is small and becomes comparable to their annihilation rate . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , antikaons approach chemical equilibrium much earlier but eventually fall out of equilibrium again as a result of their large annihilation cross sections in nuclear matter .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 25.75.dw , 24.10.jv , 24.10.lx    2    recent analyses have shown that most hadrons measured in heavy ion collisions can be described by statistical models based on the grand canonical ensemble for abundant particles @xcite and the canonical ensemble for rare particles @xcite . on the other hand , studies based on transport model indicate that the chemical equilibration time for kaons and antikaons in the hot dense matter , that is expected to be formed in heavy ion collisions at the ags and sps energies , is an order of magnitude longer than the heavy ion collision time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has thus been suggested @xcite that the kaon equilibration time can be significantly shortened if the kaon mass is reduced in dense matter as a result of the large attractive scalar interaction and diminishing repulsive vector interaction due to the assumption of vector decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> the disappearance of the repulsive vector interaction is , however , not consistent with the strong repulsive vector potential that is needed to understand the vanishing kaon flow observed in heavy ion collisions at gsi energies @xcite and the large kaon antiflow observed in heavy ion collisions at ags energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , a recent transport model study has shown that the measured kaon yield in heavy ion collisions at gsi @xcite can be explained with kaons interacting with both the scalar and vector potentials @xcite .    to gain insight into this problem , a kinetic theory for the time evolution of particle production @xcite can be applied . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the equilibrium time , @xmath0 , for rare particles carrying @xmath1 charge and described by the canonical ensemble due to @xmath1 charge conservation , is much shorter than what is expected from the grand canonical ensemble , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average multiplicity of rare particles per event if they were described by the grand canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is shown that @xmath4 so the equilibrium multiplicity in the canonical ensemble is much lower than that given by the grand canonical ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> the above idea based on the kinetic theory can be quantitatively studied using the transport models , which have been very successful in understanding many aspects of heavy ion collisions @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we shall use the transport model to study kaon and antikaon production in heavy ion collisions at energies that are below the thresholds for their production in nucleon - nucleon interactions , and to understand how kaons and antikaons approach chemical equilibrium in these collisions . in previous studies of subthreshold kaon production using transport models </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only the production of kaons has been included while their annihilation via the inverse reactions has been neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the neglect of kaon annihilation would not be a bad approximation if kaons are far from chemical equilibrium . however , to understand kaon chemical equilibration in transport models , we need to include kaon annihilation to see how the kaon production and annihilation rates become comparable during the finite heavy ion collision time .    </S>",
    "<S> we follow essentially the same model used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is based on the relativistic transport model rvuu @xcite . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the nuclear potential is taken from the nonlinear walecka model , so it has both an attractive scalar and a repulsive vector part . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive scalar potential allows one to treat consistently the change of nucleon mass in nuclear matter . in dense matter </S>",
    "<S> , the nucleon mass is reduced and the energy is in the scalar field . as the system expands , the nucleon regain its mass from the scalar field energy . </S>",
    "<S> the model in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite includes kaon production from both baryon - baryon and meson - baryon interactions . for kaon production from baryon - baryon interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections are taken from the predictions of the meson - exchange model introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for kaon production cross sections from meson - baryon interactions , they are obtained from the resonance model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the produced kaons together with their partners , mainly hyperons , not only undergo elastic scatterings with baryons but are also affected by mean - field potentials . for kaon and hyperon scattering cross sections , </S>",
    "<S> we take the empirical values as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kaon potential is taken from the chiral lagrangian including both scalar and vector interactions @xcite with their strengths determined from experimental observables such as the kaon yield and collective flow in heavy ion collisions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the kaon production probability is much smaller than one in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies , it is usually treated by the perturbative method , i.e. , the effect of kaon production on the dynamics of heavy ion collisions is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , a kaon is produced in a baryon - baryon or a meson - baryon interaction that is above the production threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the produced kaon then carries a probability given by the ratio of the kaon production cross section to the total baryon - baryon or meson - baryon cross section . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , to treat the rescattering of kaons and hyperons with other particles , one allows more than one pair of kaon and hyperon to be produced in such a collision . </S>",
    "<S> when these kaons and hyperons are scattered by other particles , their momenta are changed according to the differential cross section , which is usually taken to be isotropic , while changes of the momenta of the other particles are neglected . the final kaon yield and spectrum </S>",
    "<S> are then obtained by adding the probabilities of individual kaons and dividing by the number of kaons produced in each baryon - baryon or meson - baryon collision .    to study the chemical equilibration of kaons , we improve the model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by including also kaon annihilation by hyperon , using the cross sections determined from the meson - baryon interactions via the detailed balance relations . </S>",
    "<S> because of strangeness conservation , a kaon is produced together with a hyperon . as the kaon production probability is much less than one in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies </S>",
    "<S> , there is only one hyperon in an event in which a kaon is produced . </S>",
    "<S> kaon annihilation can thus occur only when there is a collision between the same pair of kaon and hyperon that is produced in the baryon - baryon or meson - baryon interaction . as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite via the kinetic equation , the annihilation between such a pair of particles that are produced simultaneously as a result of the @xmath1 charge conservation would lead to an equilibration described by the canonical ensemble .    to illustrate the physics of kaon chemical equilibration in heavy ion collisions , we consider ni+ni collisions at @xmath5 gev and impact parameter @xmath6 fm , which is below the threshold for both kaon and antikaon production in nucleon - nucleon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained for collision energies at @xmath7 gev , which is above the kaon production threshold but below the antikaon production threshold in nucleon - nucleon interactions . in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kaon ] , the time evolution of the kaon abundance for the scenarios with ( solid curve ) and without ( dotted curve ) kaon annihilation are given . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that including kaon annihilation by hyperon reduces the final kaon yield by only about 10% . as shown in the lower window of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kaon ] , the kaon production rate ( solid curve ) is appreciable only when the nuclear density ( thick solid curve ) is high . </S>",
    "<S> the effect due to kaon annihilation is better illustrated by the kaon annihilation rate ( dashed curve ) shown in the bottom panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kaon ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the annihilation rate is negligible during the high density stage when most kaons are produced . </S>",
    "<S> this result thus justifies the neglect of kaon annihilation in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> although the kaon annihilation rate is small , it becomes comparable to the kaon production rate at about 17 fm/@xmath8 , indicating that the kaon yield eventually approaches chemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the baryon density at which kaons reach chemical equilibrium is about 1.2 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the normal nuclear matter density .    to better understand kaon production in heavy ion collisions , it is useful to know if the system is close to thermal equilibrium when kaons are produced . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we have evaluated the average squared momentum of all particles both in the beam direction , @xmath12 , and in the transverse direction , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath14 can then be used to characterize the degree of thermal equilibrium , with a value of one corresponding to complete thermal equilibrium . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ thermal ] , we show the time evolution of this ratio for nucleons ( solid curve ) , deltas ( dotted curve ) , and pions ( dashed curve ) in the central volume of 8 @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that at the time when most kaons are produced , both pions and deltas are close to thermal equilibrium while nucleons are not . since kaons are dominantly produced from pion and nucleon interactions ( about 70% ) , our results thus show that they are mostly produced from a dense but not thermally equilibrated hadronic matter .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the kinetic theory @xcite , the chemical equilibration time in the canonical formalism is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the volume of the region where kaon annihilation occurs , @xmath18 is the momentum averaged cross section for kaon annihilation , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the kaon number and its absorption rate , respectively . at time </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 fm/@xmath8 when the kaon absorption rate is largest , we have from fig . [ kaon ] , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which give a kaon chemical equilibration time of 60 fm / c if the system is prevented from expanding from @xmath21 fm/@xmath8 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal average of the kaon annihilation cross section @xmath24 is about 0.25 @xmath25 at temperature @xmath26 mev , and it changes by less than 20% for @xmath27 mev due to the exothermic nature of the annihilation process . </S>",
    "<S> the above value for the kaon chemical equilibration time implies that the effective volume in which kaon annihilation occurs is about 15 @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> since the chemical equilibration time for kaons is much longer than the heavy ion collision time , we would normally expect them not to reach chemical equilibrium during the collisions . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the kaon production rate decreases strongly as the temperature decreases due to the large threshold of the production process , its value can thus become comparable to the annihilation rate when the system expands and cools . when this happens for later stage of heavy ion collisions as shown in the transport model results of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kaon ] , kaons can then reach chemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we thus note that , since most kaons are produced in the dense but non - equilibrium stage , the chemical equilibration time could be overestimated when determined in the normal way . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the chemical freeze - out temperature extracted from the final kaon abundance in thermal model analysis does not provide sufficient information on the dynamics of kaon production .    the effect due to kaon annihilation depends on the magnitude of kaon and hyperon elastic scattering cross sections with other particles . </S>",
    "<S> if there are no such scatterings , e.g , if these cross sections are set to zero , then the produced kaon and hyperon would simply move away from each other without further interactions , leading to a result similar to that without kaon annihilation . on the other hand , larger kaon and hyperon scattering cross sections with other particles </S>",
    "<S> would force them into a smaller region , thus increasing the kaon annihilation rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kaon ] by the dashed curve , which is obtained by taking the kaon and hyperon scattering cross sections with other baryons to be twice the default values . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that these larger cross sections indeed further reduce the kaon yield .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study antikaon production within the relativistic transport model , where antikaons are produced not only from baryon - baryon and meson - baryon interactions but also from meson - hyperon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for antikaon production from both baryon - baryon and meson - baryon interactions are taken from an analysis based on the meson - exchange model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for antikaon production from the meson - hyperon interactions , the cross sections are obtained from the empirical cross sections for @xmath28 absorption by nucleon to form a pion and a hyperon @xcite . as first pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , antikaon production in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies is mainly due to the meson - hyperon interactions . for antikaon annihilation , </S>",
    "<S> it is dominated by the reaction @xmath29 , and this has already been included in previous transport model studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that to account for the observed enhancement of antikaon production in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies , it has been shown in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that a dropping of antikaon mass due to medium effects is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for antikaon production in ni+ni collisions at @xmath5 gev and impact parameter @xmath6 fm are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ akaon ] . in the top panel , the time evolution of antikaon abundance </S>",
    "<S> is shown for the cases with ( solid curve for default kaon and hyperon elastic scattering cross sections and dashed curve for twice the default cross sections ) and without ( dotted curve ) kaon annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of antikaon yield when kaon annihilation is allowed is due to the reduction in the production probability of hyperons , which contribute most to antikaon production . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the antikaon production and annihilation rates are shown in the bottom panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ akaon ] by the solid and dashed curves , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar to kaon production , we find that antikaons are mostly produced in the high density stage of heavy ion collisions . because of the large baryon density , their annihilation rate through the reaction @xmath29 is larger than the kaon annihilation rate . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> antikaons approach chemical equilibrium even in the earlier stage of heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> however , they eventually fall out of equilibrium as shown in the lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ akaon ] .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have improved the perturbative treatment of strange particle production in the relativistic transport model by including the annihilation of kaon and hyperon that are produced as a pair due to strangeness conservation . for heavy ion collisions at energies below the threshold for strange particle production in nucleon - nucleon interactions , we find that both kaons and antikaons are largely produced during the high density stage of the collisions when the system has not reached thermal equilibrium . because of their large annihilation cross sections in dense nuclear matter , antikaons are near chemical equilibrium much earlier . for kaons , </S>",
    "<S> their abundance at high density stage is far from equilibrium , and it only becomes close to the equilibrium value during the expansion stage of heavy ion collisions when the production rate is small and comparable to the annihilation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the small kaon annihilation rate in heavy ion collisions thus justifies the neglect of kaon annihilation in previous transport model studies of subthreshold kaon production . </S>"
