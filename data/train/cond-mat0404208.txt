    "the widths @xmath14 of ag wires determined from the best fits of magnetoresistance data to weak localization theory are often 10 - 15% smaller than the widths determined from electron microscope pictures .",
    "this is probably due to the granularity of the ag wires .    the purported @xmath173 power law for the electron - phonon scattering rate is not expected to be obeyed in disordered metals over any appreciable temperature range .",
    "its observation over a limited range may be due to a crossover between @xmath174 and @xmath175 behaviors , or even between two @xmath175 regimes with different prefactors .",

    "surprisingly , the values of the reservoir heating parameters that produce the best fits to the data are somewhat smaller than the values calculated from the reservoir heating model discussed in @xcite ."

    "<S> the energy dependence and intensity of coulomb interaction between quasiparticles in metallic wires is obtained from two different methods  : determination of the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time from the magnetoresistance , and measurements of the energy distribution function in out - of - equilibrium situations . in both types of experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the coulomb interaction is found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions . </S>",
