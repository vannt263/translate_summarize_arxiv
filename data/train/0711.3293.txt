    "a rabbit runs in a straight line with a speed @xmath0 .",
    "a dog with a speed @xmath1 starts to pursuit it and during the pursuit always runs in the direction towards the rabbit .",
    "initially the rabbit is at the origin while the dog s coordinates are @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "after what time does the dog catch the rabbit ?",
    "this classic chase problem and its variations are often used in introductory mechanics course @xcite .",
    "when one asks to find the dog s trajectory ( curve of pursuit ) , the problem becomes an exercise in advanced calculus and/or in the elementary theory of differential equations @xcite .",
    "however , its treatment simplifies if the traditional machinery of physical kinematics is used @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of the solution becomes even simpler if we further underline the use of physical concepts like reference frames , vector equations , decomposition of velocity into radial and tangential components .",
    "let @xmath3 be a radius - vector of the dog and @xmath4  a radius - vector of the rabbit .",
    "so that @xmath5 as the dog always is heading towards the rabbit , we can write @xmath6 the proportionality coefficient @xmath7 depends on time .",
    "namely , at the start and at the end of the chase we , obviously , have @xmath8 differentiating ( 2 ) and using ( 1 ) , we get @xmath9 as the dog s velocity does not change in magnitude , it must be perpendicular to the dog s acceleration all the time : @xmath10 formally this follows from @xmath11 equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) imply @xmath12 or @xmath13 we can integrate the last equation and get @xmath14 at the time @xmath15 , when the dog catches the rabbit and the chase terminates , we must have @xmath16 , and remembering that @xmath17 we easily find @xmath18 from ( 7 ) : @xmath19",
    "let us decompose the dog s velocity into the radial and tangential components in the rabbit s frame ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "but @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore @xmath24 if we divide the first equation on the second and take into account that @xmath25 we get @xmath26 hence @xmath27 putting @xmath28 and using the decomposition @xmath29 where @xmath30 we can easily integrate and get @xmath31 @xmath32}.\\ ] ] therefore , the equation of the dog s trajectory in the rabbit s frame is @xmath33",
    "let us now find the dog s trajectory in the laboratory frame . from ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we get @xmath34 which",

    "we get @xmath44 and therefore @xmath45 it remains to differentiate ( 12 ) to get @xmath46 , and hence the desired expression for @xmath7 : @xmath47 .",

    "let speeds of the dog and the rabbit are equal in magnitude and their initial positions are as shown in the fig.[fig3 ] . to",
    "what limit converges the distance between them ?",
    "it is convenient to answer this question in the rabbit s frame . for equal velocities",
    "@xmath49 , equations ( 9 ) take the form @xmath50 therefore @xmath51 but @xmath52 we see that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant . at @xmath55",
    "we have ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) @xmath56 therefore @xmath57 in the rabbit",
    "s frame @xmath58 , when @xmath59 .",
    "hence the limit distance between the dog and the rabbit is @xcite @xmath60",
    "if the rabbit is allowed to change the magnitude of his speed , he can manage to keep the distance between him and the dog constant .",
    "let us find the required functional dependence @xmath61 and the dog s trajectory in this case .",
    "if @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 , equations ( 9 ) take the form @xmath64 therefore @xmath65 which can be easily integrated to get @xmath66 or @xmath67 then the first equation of ( 17 ) determines the required form of the rabbit s velocity @xmath68 ( note that we are assuming @xmath69 , as in fig.[fig3 ] , so that @xmath70 ) .    now let us find the dog s trajectory .",
    "we have ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) @xmath71 @xmath72 but @xmath73 because @xmath74 according to the second equation of ( 17 ) .    by using the decomposition @xmath75,\\ ] ] the integral in ( 19 )",
    "is easily evaluated with the result @xmath76.\\ ] ] therefore the parametric form of the dog s trajectory is @xmath77 to get the explicit form of the trajectory , we use @xmath78 @xmath79 which gives @xmath80 this trajectory is a part of tractrix  the famous curve @xcite with the defining property that the length of its tangent , between its directrix ( the @xmath81-axis in our case ) and the point of tangency , has the same value @xmath82 for all points of the tractrix .",
    "we think the problem considered is of pedagogical value for undergraduate students , which take their first year course in physics .",
    "it demonstrates the use of some important concepts of physical kinematics , as already stressed by mungan in ref .",
    "the approach presented in this article requires only minimal mathematical background and , therefore , is suitable for students which just begin their physics education .",
    "however , if desired , this classic chase problem allows a demonstration of more elaborate mathematical concepts like frenet - serret formulas @xcite , mercator projection in cartography @xcite , and even hyperbolic geometry ( which is realized on the surface of revolution of a tractrix about its directrix ) @xcite .",
