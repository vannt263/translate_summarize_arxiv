    "however , first applications @xcite of this sort of approach to three - point functions , beyond the leading order of qcd perturbation theory , have made it clear that , ultimately , there must be an extension of this formalism from the level of the running coupling and its powers to the level of amplitudes .",
    "the reason is that in three - point functions at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) level , and beyond , logarithms of a distinct scale ( serving as the factorization or evolution scale ) appear that though they do not change the nature of the landau pole , they affect the discontinuity across the cut along the negative real axis @xmath3 . on account of factorization , we expect that this effect should be small , of the order of a few percent , because any change caused by the variation of the factorization scale should be of the next higher order . however , to achieve a high - precision theoretical prediction , one should reduce this uncertainty , lifting the limitations imposed by the lack of knowledge about uncalculated higher - order corrections . to encompass such logarithmic terms in the `` analytization '' procedure , one should demand the analyticity of the partonic amplitude as a _ whole _ @xcite and calculate the dispersive image of the coupling ( or of its powers ) _ in conjunction _ with these logarithms .",

    "we have discussed different `` analytization '' procedures to ensure the analyticity of the factorized electromagnetic pion form factor at nlo of qcd perturbation theory .",
    "the main features and relative merits of each `` analytization '' concept following from the presented analysis are :    * the _ naive _ ",
    "analytization @xcite retains the power - series expansion of perturbative qcd , but replaces @xmath118 by @xmath119 .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , this reduces the value of the nlo correction , though the sensitivity to the renormalization scheme adopted and the renormalization scale - setting chosen is still substantial , resulting into a rather strong variation of the form - factor predictions @xcite .",
    "moreover , this procedure does not respect nonlinear relations of the coupling because these correspond to different dispersive images . *",
    "the _ maximal _ `` analytization '' @xcite trades the power - series expansion for a functional non - power - series expansion in terms of @xmath120 @xcite , minimizing the variation of the form - factor predictions owing to the renormalization scheme and scale setting .",
    "it is , however , insufficient to cure logarithms of the momentum scale multiplying the running coupling .",
    "such terms modify the spectral density , i.e. , the discontinuity across the cut along the negative real axis and have therefore to be taken into account . * applying the `` analytization '' procedure at the level of the partonic amplitude itself @xcite , bears all advantages of the _ maximal _ `` analytization '' plus a further reduced dependence on the perturbative scales  especially the dependence on the factorization scale .",
    "this has been verified by explicit calculation .",
    "we have employed the scheme with various scale settings and also the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "in addition , we have varied the factorization scale in the range @xmath121  gev@xmath48 . while the predictions for the factorized pion form factor , calculated with the _ maximal _ procedure , were affected by this variation on the level of 3% , their counterparts , derived with the ks prescription , were influenced by less than 1% .",
    "though the ks method does not really `` gain up '' relative to the _ maximal _ `` analytization '' procedure with respect to the factorized pion form factor , as one observes from fig.[fig : pion - form - factor ] , it is able to further improve the perturbative treatment because it extends the notion of analyticity to non - integer powers of the strong running coupling  fapt .",
    "such powers become relevant when one has to calculate the analytic image of powers of the strong coupling in combination with logarithms , the latter first appearing at nlo of fixed - order perturbation theory , or in terms of evolution factors @xcite . hence",
    ", the ks `` analytization '' requirement treats all logarithms that have a non - zero spectral density , and hence modify the discontinuity across the cut along the negative real axis , on the same footing and irrespective of their source being it the running coupling ( and its powers ) , or logarithms entailed by erbl  or dglap  evolution .    in conclusion",
    ", the ks `` analytization '' enables the variation of the factorization scale and the choice of various renormalization schemes and scale settings , including the blm  one , with undiminished quality of the theoretical predictions from scheme ( scale ) to scheme ( scale ) , virtually eliminating the dependence on such parameters and upgrading the scheme to an optimized factorization and renormalization scheme . from a broader perspective",
    "one may interpret these findings as indicating that the analyticity of the partonic three - point function is as important and fundamental as the underlying symmetries of the theory and should be preserved together with them in the maximal possible way .",

    "<S> we show that demanding the analyticity of the partonic amplitude as a _ whole _ , as proposed before by karanikas and stefanis , one can make infrared finite not only the strong running coupling and its powers , but also cure potentially large logarithms ( that first appear at next - to - leading order ) containing the factorization scale and modifying the discontinuity across the cut along the negative real axis . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme used here generalizes the analytic perturbation theory of shirkov and solovtsov to non - integer powers of the strong coupling and diminishes the dependence of qcd hadronic quantities on all perturbative scheme and scale - setting parameters , including the factorization scale . </S>"
