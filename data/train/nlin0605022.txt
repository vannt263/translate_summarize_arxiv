    "the presence of chaos has been extensively demonstrated in many naturally occurring nonlinear systems .",
    "the capability of the chaotic state to amplify small perturbations improves their utility for reaching specific desired states with very high flexibility and low energy cost .",
    "however there are many situations like power systems where control of chaos is desirable .",
    "this helps in improving a desired behaviour by making only small time dependant perturbations in a system parameter . in this context",
    ", a key observation is that a chaotic attractor has embedded within it an infinite set of unstable periodic orbits and the control mechanism aims at stabilising the system to any chosen one among them .",
    "the theoretical and experimental works so far done on this topic shows that various methods of control are capable of leading to improved performance and ordered response  @xcite .",
    "moreover the naturally occurring chaotic orbits on a dynamical attractor has been utilised to carry information  @xcite .",
    "thus one can encode and transmit a prescribed message using chaotic states .",
    "this process may offer practical advantages over the usual periodic carriers , such as the possibility of real time reconstructions of signal dropouts in the communication .",
    "in such cases , it is desirable to have a number of systems behaving in a synchronised manner and this is achieved by coupling or feedback between systems .",
    "the phenomenon of synchronisation in chaotic systems has received much attention since 1990  @xcite .",
    "it is found to occur in the dynamics of many coupled physical @xcite and biological systems  @xcite such as neurons in a network @xcite .",
    "the synchronisation schemes form the basis of biological clocks that regulate daily and seasonal rhythms of living systems from bacteria to humans . even when the individual systems are in the realm of chaotic behaviour , the coupled one most often can be synchronised in periodic or regular states .",
    "thus synchronisation techniques automatically brings in control of chaos also .",
    "however there are applications like information processing where synchronised chaotic states are desirable .",
    "there are different types of synchronised states  @xcite occuring in coupled chaotic systems .",
    "the first type called complete synchronisation has received much attention with the development of a new type of communication technique that exploits the possibility of masking a message by mixing it with a chaotic signal  @xcite . with both the amplitudes and phases of the coupled systems varying in the same way the synchronised chaotic state will be restricted to a smooth invariant manifold of lower dimension than the full phase space.complete synchronisation implies that the details of the two systems are identical or their difference converges to zero .",
    "however there are situations where one observes lag synchronisation in which the system states coincide only when one of them is shifted in time .",
    "so also there are cases of generalised partial synchronisation where no amplitude synchronisation is observed but the average amplitude is bounded and varies periodically  @xcite .",
    "the majority of the research works reported in the literature have been focused on synchronisation of continuous systems and a few on discrete systems concentrate on one dimensional map @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider two dimensional discrete systems and introduce different coupling schemes and the resulting possible types of synchronisation .",
    "such systems model many interesting situations like population dynamics of mutually dependent species , neural networks , image processing techniques etc .",
    "hence the possibility of their evolution in a synchronised manner under different types of connectivity forms a useful study .",
    "moreover , two dimensional discrete systems occur as the poincar maps of three dimensional continuous systems , which are the lowest dimensional systems capable of exhibiting chaos .",
    "hence the synchronised behaviour of the latter can be analysed in a general and systematic way using the former .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ ch.sec2 ] , we describe the different coupling schemes and discuss the stability of synchronisation for each one . in  [ ch.sec3 ] and  [ ch.sec4 ] these coupling schemes are applied to two specific examples of discrete systems _ viz .",
    "_ gumowski - mira map ( gm ) and modified gumowski - mira map ( mgm ) maps and their synchronisation is studied using similarity function , stability analysis , synchronisation and stabilisation times and available basin in the parameter as well as initial value plane . it is found that complete synchronisation with control , lag synchronisation and synchronised chaotic states can be realised by choosing different coupling techniques .",
    "concluding remarks are given in  [ ch.sec5 ] .",
    "we start with a two dimensional discrete system which is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 define two dimensional space of the first map , @xmath2 the two dimensional space of the second map and @xmath3 is the control parameter . when both the systems are coupled the dynamics of the system develops as @xmath4 here @xmath5 or @xmath6 is the coupling scheme applied to both the maps which in general is a function of the variables of both maps and the coupling parameter @xmath7 .",

    "it is interesting to note that this coupling depends on the parameter @xmath3 of the individual system in addition to the usual coupling parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we find that this introduces more flexibility in the scheme by providing two parameters , one of which controls the dynamics also .",
