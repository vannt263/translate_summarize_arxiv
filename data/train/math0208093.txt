    "more than a decade ago maxim kontsevich @xcite considered graph homology as a tool for studying and computing the homology of many seemingly disparate objects .",

    "penner @xcite , the homology of the moduli space ( or equivalently mapping class group ) of surfaces .",
    "another version computes , via work of m. culler and k. vogtmann @xcite , the homology of the group of outer automorphisms of the free group .",
    "there is also a version which is related to finite type invariants of three - manifolds . on the other hand ,",
    "these three graph complexes compute the homology of three infinite dimensional lie algebras , leading to quite unexpected isomorphisms .",
    "kontsevich s graph complexes were generalized to the case of _ modular operads _ by getzler and kapranov@xcite , and were considered for the special case of cyclic operads by martin markl @xcite .",
    "in @xcite karen vogtmann and i showed that the commutative graph complex carries the structure of both a lie algebra and a lie coalgebra .",
    "these are compatible as a bialgebra on a certain natural subcomplex . in this paper",
    "i will generalize these two operations to the case of any cyclic operad , and show that they are each first in a series of higher order operations which fit together nicely and vanish on homology .",

    "i will define a sequence of  higher order brackets \" @xmath6 the map @xmath7 is defined by fusing together @xmath8 graphs along a @xmath9-gon in all possible ways ( figure  [ ngon ] ) . extending each @xmath7 as a coderivation to @xmath10 , these maps are all compatible with each other in a very strong sense ( theorem  [ lemma1 ] ) . for any subset @xmath11 ,",
    "define @xmath12 .",
    "theorem  [ lemma1 ] implies that @xmath13 .",
    "this is precisely the definition of a @xmath2 ( strong homotopy lie ) structure . in this way we get uncountably many @xmath2 structures .",

    "trouble arises , as was foreshadowed in @xcite in the compatibility between brackets and cobrackets . in @xcite",
    "we were able to avoid difficulty by restricting to connected graphs without separating edges , and indeed in this context @xmath20 are compatible in a lie bialgebra sense ( theorem  [ compat ] ) .",
    "but there appears to be no similar way out for the higher order operations . the higher order brackets and cobrackets simply fit together in a more complicated way than one would guess , even on graphs without separating edges .",
    "all of the operations are highly nontrivial on chains , and are compatible with the boundary operator .",
    "indeed they vanish canonically on the level of homology .",
    "thus these operations can be thought of as  generalized schouten brackets , \" since in the case of lie algebras , the schouten bracket is an operation on the chevalley - eilenberg complex which vanishes canonically upon application of the homology functor .",
    "moira chas and dennis sullivan @xcite define similar structures on _ string homology _ , the homology of a free loop space .",
    "they define an uncountable family of @xmath2 structures , indexed by sets of positive integers , on string homology which obey the same compatibility relations as the ones found here ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "they also find a lie bialgebra structure @xcite,@xcite .",
    "drawing the analogy further , one is led to speculate that string homology has an uncountable infinity of @xmath3-@xmath2 structures .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether such co structures , if they exist , are compatible in a nice way with the lie structures , or if they mirror more complicated graph interactions .",
    "* acknowledgements : * it is a pleasure to thank karen vogtmann for many discussions .",

    "credit also goes to the anonymous referee who noticed an error in the original manuscript and suggested many expositional improvements .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the salient features of a cyclic operad , and proceed to give markl s construction of graph complexes .",
    "a good introduction to these objects can be found in the recent book by markl , shnider and stasheff @xcite .",
    "kontsevich s three graph complexes are associated to the commutative , associative and lie operads .",
    "each of these operads @xmath21 has a description as a vector space spanned by different flavors of rooted trees with labelled leaves .    *",
    "the @xmath8th degree part of the commutative operad @xmath22 has a basis consisting of rooted trees which have one internal vertex and @xmath8 labelled leaves .",
    "hence @xmath23 $ ] is @xmath24 dimensional !",
    "the composition law @xmath25\\otimes comm[n_1]\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes comm[n_m]\\to comm[n_1+\\ldots + n_m]\\ ] ] is defined on @xmath26 by grafting the root of each @xmath27 onto the leaf of @xmath28 labelled by @xmath29 for each @xmath29 , and suitably relabelling the leaves .",
    "the composition is completed by contracting all edges not adjacent to a root or a leaf . * the @xmath8th degree part of the associative operad @xmath30 has a basis consisting of rooted trees with one internal vertex which have a specified cyclic ordering of the edges incident to the vertex , and which have @xmath8 labelled leaves .",
    "composition is again by grafting and contracting created edges , with the proviso that the cyclic ordering is respected . *",
    "the @xmath8th degree part of the lie operad @xmath31 is actually easiest to describe as a quotient space @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 has a basis given by rooted trivalent trees with @xmath8 labelled leaves , where each vertex has a specified cyclic order of adjacent edges .",
    "the as subspace is spanned by sums @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are identical except for a cyclic ordering on some vertex .",
    "modding out by as says that lie algebras are anti - symmetric .",
    "the ihx subspace is spanned by sums @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are identical trees except at one spot where they are as in figure [ ihxagain ] . on the level of lie algebras",
    "this is the jacobi relation .",
    "composition is via grafting , but without the contraction step .",
    "notice that in each of these cases the action of the symmetric group @xmath38 which permutes the labels of the leaves can be extended to an action of @xmath39 .",
    "this is by thinking of the root as another labelled leaf , say labelled by @xmath40 .",
    "( one must check in the lie case that the ihx subspace is preserved by this action . )",
    "operads where this extension is possible are called _ cyclic _",
    "@xcite , provided that the extension satisfies appropriate axioms .",
    "other examples of cyclic operads are the endomorphism operad and the poisson operad .    as a general philosophy",
    ", one can think of cyclic operads as consisting of unrooted trees , with composition given by some version of grafting .",
    "the idea is to plug these in to the nodes of a graph to obtain different types of decorations on a graph .",
    "plugging in a basis element from @xmath22 at each vertex of valence @xmath8 , one simply gets an undecorated graph .",
    "plugging in an element of @xmath30 one gets a cyclic order at the vertex .",
    "this is often called a ribbon graph . plugging in an element of @xmath31",
    "gives a relatively strange object . by definition",
    "it is obtained from some unrooted ribbon trivalent trees by joining the leaves together with edges .",
    "see figure [ lieexample ] .",
    "thus one may think of it as a trivalent graph with a special distinguished subset where ihx and as relations may take place .",
    "it is reminiscent of the diagram algebras that appear in the theory of vassiliev invariants of low dimensional objects , which consist of ( uni)trivalent graphs , but where the as and ihx relations are not restricted to a distinguished subset .    in general ,",
    "let @xmath41 be the set of half - edges incident to a vertex .",
    "let @xmath42 be a labelling of the elements of @xmath41 by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the valence of @xmath45 .",
    "now define @xmath46 which is the set of coinvariants under the action of @xmath39 , which acts as follows . if @xmath47 , let @xmath48 denote putting @xmath49 in the @xmath42th summand of the direct sum . if @xmath50 then @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath4 is an operad of trees , @xmath52 is isomorphic to the space of identifications of the leaves and root of elements of @xmath53 $ ] with the half - edges incident to @xmath45 .",
    "now we define an @xmath54-labelling of a graph to be a choice of element @xmath55 for each vertex , @xmath45 , of the graph . graphically , we put a circle at each vertex to represent the operad element .",
    "in addition we would like a notion of  orientation \" of a graph , which will make it possible to define a boundary operator .",
    "this is analogous to the need for an orientation of the simplices of a simplicial complex in order to do the same .",
    "there are many equivalent notions , perhaps the most intuitive is the following .",
    "an orientation of a graph is an ordering of the vertices and a choice of direction for each edge , modulo the even action of @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the number or vertices and edges of the graph , respectively .",
    "an element of @xmath56 is called even if it is a product of an even number of elements each of which is either a transposition in @xmath59 or an element of the form @xmath60 .",
    "notice that any graph has exactly two orientations .",
    "let @xmath61 indicate the map switching orientations .",
    "lie graphs actually have a much simpler description , because the orientations of the graph and vertices cancel out to a large degree .",
    "namely , one can think of a lie graph as a trivalent graph with a distinguished subforest , whose edges are ordered modulo even permutations .",
    "the ihx relation in the lie operad becomes the condition that the three terms in an ihx relation of the trivalent graph sum to zero provided the edge involved is in the forest .",
    "this will be explained carefully in @xcite .",
    "now for any cyclic operad @xmath54 we are ready to define @xmath62-graph complexes .",
    "define @xmath63 to be the span of @xmath62-labelled oriented graphs with vertices all of valence @xmath64 , modulo the relation @xmath65 and also modulo multilinearity of the @xmath4-labels .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath66 where the direct sum is over oriented graphs with vertices of valence @xmath64 , and where @xmath67 is the set of vertices of @xmath68 .",
    "define @xmath63 to be the part of @xmath5 with @xmath45 vertices .    for each edge , @xmath69 , in a graph @xmath70 we define contraction along that edge @xmath71 to be the graph where the two operad elements at each endpoint of @xmath69 are composed along @xmath69 .",
    "the induced orientation can be fixed by assuming that the endpoints of @xmath69 are labelled @xmath24 and @xmath72 and the edge direction is from @xmath24 to @xmath72 .",
    "the new vertex , which results from composing the two operad elements , is labelled @xmath24 , and all other indices are reduced by @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath69 is a loop , then define @xmath73 . in the commutative case ,",
    "@xmath71 is defined by simply contracting the edge of the ( undecorated ) graph . in the associative case",
    "the cyclic orders at both endpoints of an edge are joined together to give a cyclic order at the vertex resulting from the edge collapse .",
    "for an example in the lie case , see figure [ lieexample ] .",
    "define @xmath74 by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the set of edges of @xmath68 . in the simpler version of the lie case",
    ", the boundary operator adds an edge to the forest in all possible ways , with the edge s number coming directly after the edge numbers in the original forest .",
    "@xmath5 is a graded commutative algebra under disjoint union .",
    "it is also a graded commutative coalgebra , defining the coproduct such that connected graphs are primitive , and extending multiplicatively .",
    "thus we may write @xmath14 for the subspace generated by connected graphs .",
    "let @xmath77 be the subspace generated by connected graphs with @xmath78 .",
    "even though this paper is concerned with chain complexes and not their homology per se , it is still useful to record the following facts .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the group of outer automorphisms of the free group @xmath80 , and let @xmath81 denote the moduli space of a surface of genus @xmath82 with @xmath83 unlabelled punctures .",
    "then @xmath84 in addition , part of commutative graph cohomology plays a role in the theory of finite type invariants of homology @xmath85-spheres .",
    "more precisely , we have that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the diagram algebra where the logarithm of the aarhus version of the lmo invariant takes values @xcite .    the first two statements above are due to kontsevich , being implicit in his paper @xcite .",
    "a more detailed explanation of these two facts and their proofs will appear in @xcite .",
    "the last statement , the relation to finite type invariants , is essentially content - free , being a trivial isomorphism , at least modulo equivalences of various notions of orientation .      in at least two interesting cases , it is possible to define graph cohomology .",
    "the coboundary operator @xmath88 is the sum of inserting an edge in all possible ways . in the commutative and associative cases",
    "this makes perfect sense .",
    "unfortunately , in the lie case an insertion , which is essentially the deletion of an edge from the forest , does not preserve the ihx subspace and is not well - defined . in the cases where",
    "@xmath88 can be defined the boundary and coboundary are adjoint with respect to the inner product @xmath89 fusion ------",
    "we start with an oriented labelled @xmath9-gon .",
    "label every other edge on its perimeter consecutively by the numbers @xmath90 , consistent with the orientation .",
    "now fix @xmath8 directed edges @xmath91 of a graph @xmath68 .",
    "define @xmath92 to be the graph formed in the following way .",
    "first , for each @xmath29 , glue the edge marked @xmath29 of the @xmath9-gon to the edge @xmath93 of the graph .",
    "second , delete these edges along which the @xmath9-gon was attached leaving @xmath8 new edges .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ ngon ] .",
    "the graph @xmath94 has an induced orientation which can be easily described . fix a labelling of the graph such that the directions of the edges @xmath95 are both consistent with the graph s orientation and with the directions which correspond to the gluing .",
    "the @xmath8 new edges have orientations induced by the @xmath8-gon .",
    "switch all of these , as is usual with a cobordism .",
    "now , for any @xmath96 we define an operation @xmath97 by @xmath98 , where    * the sum is over all @xmath8-tuples of directed edges @xmath99 all of which lie in separate @xmath100 . *",
    "the notation ",
    "@xmath101 \" denotes  graded symmetric tensor product . \" * the edge @xmath69 which is contracted is the edge coming from the boundary of the @xmath9-gon between `` 1 '' and `` 2 . ''",
    "thus @xmath7 is a type of fusion operation which takes @xmath8 graphs and fuses them together along a @xmath9-gon .",
    "extend @xmath7 to @xmath10 as a coderivation .",
    "that is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an ordered partition of @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is the sign defined by the equation @xmath107 .",
    "notice that @xmath108 by definition glues on a bigon to an edge , which does nt change the edge , and then contracts it .",
    "that is , @xmath109 .",

    "we then attach a disk to the result together with the other @xmath120 graphs .",
    "if the second disk attaches to an edge not involved in the first disk , then this gives the same unoriented result as attaching the disks in the other order .",
    "keeping track of the orientation , we see that the two orders of attaching the disk cancel .",
    "the other possibility is that the second disk attaches to the first .",
    "this can be thought of as attaching a @xmath121-gon to the @xmath122 graphs , with a separating arc along the @xmath121-gon , and two ordered edges marked for collapse .",
    "we can simplify the combinatorics somewhat by shrinking the complement of the @xmath122 attaching regions for the disk , to get a @xmath122-gon with an arc joining two vertices and two vertices marked for collapse .",
    "the sorts of configurations that arise are exactly recorded by the concept of _ admissible _ defined below .",
    "the lemma now follows from the following analysis of @xmath122-gons .",
    "define @xmath123 be the set of admissible configurations of a @xmath122-gon .",
    "an admissible configuration consists of an embedded arc on the @xmath122-gon between two of the vertices , thereby partitioning the @xmath122 vertices into two sets of @xmath120 and @xmath124 respectively , on each side of the arc .",
    "there are also two vertices labelled by @xmath24 and @xmath72 , the @xmath24 must be in the set of @xmath120 and the @xmath72 must be among the @xmath124 or it could be one of the endpoints of the arc . we claim that the subset of @xmath123 where two specific vertices are marked @xmath24 and @xmath72 is bijective with the subset where these vertices are marked @xmath72 and @xmath24 , respectively .",

    "the arc in this case will partition the vertices into a set of @xmath128 , and a set of @xmath129 , where the @xmath24 vertex must lie in the @xmath128 and the @xmath72 elsewhere .",
    "we claim there is a bijective correspondence between subsets of @xmath127 where two fixed vertices are labelled 1 and 2 and the subsets of @xmath130 where these vertices are labelled 2 and 1 .",
