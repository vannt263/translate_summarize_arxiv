    "diffeomorphism symmetry is the fundamental gauge symmetry of general relativity , deeply entangled with its dynamics . in the canonical framework",
    "this gauge symmetry leads to the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "they generate multi  fingered time evolution  that is the equal time hypersurface can be deformed and pushed forward in various ways .",
    "these deformations of the hypersurface satisfy a geometric algebra which is reflected in the poisson algebra of the constraints @xcite , known as dirac s hypersurface deformation algebra @xcite .    an important goal for the canonical quantization program is to find a quantum representation of the algebra @xcite .",
    "it has not been reached yet , even in the case of 3d gravity which is a topological theory and is well understood in many of its aspects .",
    "the dirac algebra is universal @xcite , i.e. it is the same algebra for any theory of hypersurfaces embedded in a higher dimensional manifold . to understand possible quantum representations of this algebra",
    "would therefore be beneficial not only for gravity .",
    "one reason that such a representation is still missing , is that many approaches use discretizations either from the outset or as auxiliary structures to e.g. regularize the quantum constraints .",
    "however discretizations generically break diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite , even classically and in simple systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , the canonical analysis of regge gravity @xcite shows that in this case constraints are replaced by proper evolution equations @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "regge gravity @xcite does however provide a symmetry preserving discretization , which has to be adjusted to the presence of the cosmological constant @xcite though .",
    "thus we might hope that a quantum representation of the constraint algebra might be obtainable at least in this case .",
    "indeed quantizations of the constraints are available @xcite , although a representation of the dirac algebra , even classically , has not been found so far .",
    "3d quantum gravity @xcite had been used as a simplified model for 4d gravity for some time .",
    "it can be formulated in a number of ways , in traditional ( canonical ) adm form , for instance @xcite , in chern ",
    "simons form @xcite or as a so  called bf theory , which coincides with the palatini formulation of 3d gravity .",
    "we will work with the latter version , as it is nearest to the variables and methods used in loop quantum gravity , see for instance @xcite .",
    "there has been also a considerable amount of work on the loop quantum gravity version of 3d gravity @xcite .",
    "most of this work , with the exception of @xcite makes use of the fact that the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints can be recast into the flatness constraints . whereas the first set satisfies the dirac algebra of hypersurface deformations , the second set is abelian . despite a good understanding of discrete 3d gravity",
    "there is so far no complete discussion or definition of dirac s hypersurface deformation algebra for discrete surfaces available .",
    "the works @xcite are incomplete for various reasons , with @xcite arguing ( incorrectly ) that such an algebra has to be necessarily non  local .",
    "thus we will provide here an explicit classical realization of the hypersurface deformation algebra for discrete 3d gravity .",
    "we discuss the geometric interpretation of the constraints and use these insights to define ( various ) hypersurface deformation algebras also for discrete 4d gravity ( and higher dimensional discretized surfaces ) . in this case",
    "we have however to restrict to the flat sector ( or homogeneously curved sector if a cosmological constant is present ) of these theories , as otherwise diffeomorphism symmetry will be broken by the discretization .",
    "nevertheless this justifies the hope that some results of the 3d theory can be applied to the 4d case .",
    "this might even hold for the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in the section [ sec :",
    "continuum ] , we review the continuum formulation of 3d gravity , in particular the dirac algebra , and we present in the section [ 3 ] the discretization we are going to use , inherited from loop quantum gravity . in the section [ 4 ]",
    "we introduce the hamitlonian and diffeomorphism constraints , using a natural space ",
    "time splits coming from the loop quantum gravity fluxes .",
    "we discuss the form of the algebra and the main tool for its computation in the section [ 5 ] . in the sections [ 6 ] and [ 7 ]",
    ", we give the explicit poisson brackets between the constraints associated to a single 3-valent vertex and to a face respectively .",
    "the hypersurface deformation algebra is written in terms of lengths and dihedral angles in the section [ 8 ] .",
    "the section [ 9 ] shows that the thiemann trick , used to define the quantum hamiltonian in loop quantum gravity ( in particular @xcite ) is also available in the discrete setting , and can be used to write our hamiltonian constraints .",
    "we then move on to higher dimensions , starting with the 4d case in the section [ sec:4dflat ] , in which we argue that a closed algebra is available in the flat sector of the theory .",
    "we introduce the corresponding constraints in the section [ simplex ] , which work in arbitrary dimension on the boundary of a @xmath0-simplex .",
    "the constraint algebra is found in the section [ sec : bsda ] , and generalized to the case of a non - vanishing cosmological constant ( describing homogeneously curved space ) in the section [ sec : curved ] .",
    "we close the paper with a discussion in the section [ sec : discussion ] . the appendix [ app : calculations ] provides details on the evaluation of the poisson brackets for 3d gravity , relevant for the sections [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] , and the appendix [ a ] contains background material on the affine metric in a simplex that we use in the sections [ simplex ] , [ sec : bsda ] .",

    "the gau   constraints generate gauge transformations on the internal index , i.e. internal rotations . later  on , in the section [ 8 ] , we will discuss the reduced phase space with respect to the gau   constraints .    from the construction of the holonomy and flux variables we can infer the following interpretation .",
    "the flux @xmath64 gives the components of the edge @xmath49 in a frame associated to the source vertex @xmath65 of @xmath21 .",
    "the holonomy variables @xmath66 are used to transport between the frames associated to the source vertex @xmath65 and target vertex @xmath67 of @xmath21 .",
    "thus the gau  constraints impose that the fluxes around a vertex sum to zero , which geometrically imposes that the dual edges @xmath49 form a closed curve . for a three - valent vertex",
    "this will define a closed triangle .",
    "( for higher  valent vertices the edges @xmath49 making up the piecewise linear curve close , but will in general not span a 2dimensional subspace . )",
    "due to this interpretation we will assume that the edges and vertices are the elements of a 2complex , which discretizes the 2d surface @xmath12 .",
    "this latter fact means that we can also identify faces @xmath68 .",
    "the 2complex is usually assumed to arise as the dual of a triangulation ( in which case the vertices are three  valent ) or more generally a discretization with polygonal cells ( which allows higher valent vertices ) .",
    "the flatness constraints impose that the parallel transport around ( contractible ) loops is trivial .",
    "the most elementary loops are given by the boundaries of the faces .",
    "we have furthermore to specify the frame , i.e. vertex , in which the holonomy is expressed .",
    "thus we define the flatness constraints .",
    "one can also use @xmath69  this will not change the algebra of the constraints . in the following",
    "we will understand as constraint hypersurface the subspace defined by @xmath70 . ] as f_f , v:=(h^-1_fv - h_fv ) with @xmath71 the holonomy around a face ( dual to a vertex in the triangulation ) starting with the edge @xmath72 which we assume to have @xmath63 as a source vertex @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 . in the following",

    "as can be easily checked the algebra of flatness and gau   constraints is again first class , with the flatness constraints forming an abelian subalgebra . in the following subsection",
    "we will find combinations of these constraints , that can serve as discrete versions of the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "the action of the flatness constraints on the flux associated to @xmath21 is given by [ acf ] \\",
    "{ e^k_e , f_f , v } = - ( t^k h^-1_fv + h_fv t^k ) -t^k with the last equation holding on the constraint hypersurface .",
    "again we assume that @xmath81 .",
    "the action ( [ acf ] ) of the flatness constraints generalizes to the fluxes @xmath82 with @xmath83 in the boundary of @xmath68 , if these are transported to the reference frame of @xmath65 . thus @xmath84 generates translations in the ( to @xmath63 parallel transported ) components @xmath85 of the fluxes associated to the edges @xmath83 in the boundary of the face @xmath68 .",
    "this face @xmath68 is dual to a vertex @xmath86 in the dual triangulation , and we assume that the face is such that @xmath49 , the dual edge to @xmath21 , points towards the dual vertex @xmath86 .    now contract @xmath84 with a vector @xmath87 , -f_f , v n : = -_l f^l_f , v n^l : = - _ k ( -2 ) ( f_f , v t^l n^l ) .",

    "{ e^k_e , -f_f , v n } _ l ( -2 ) ( t^k t^l n^l ) = n^k generates the translation of @xmath88 by the vector @xmath89 .",
    "thus hamiltonian ( and diffeomorphism ) constraints may be defined by contracting the holonomy around each face with some choice of normals ( and vectors tangent to the hypersurface ) . however , the holonomy @xmath71 probes the curvature around a vertex of the triangulation and there is no obvious notion of tangent and normal vectors to the vertex .",
    "one could proceed with some averaging over the normals of the adjacent triangles .",
    "that would require to specify the details of the averaging .",
    "the loop quantum gravity version @xcite proceeds in another way and associates one hamiltonian constraint ( the diffeomorphisms being treated with a different method ) to each dual vertex ( corresponding to a triangle in the triangulation ) .",
    "thus there is an averaging over the three vertices of the triangle and correspondingly of the three holonomies involved .",
    "note that the counting of constraints might not necessarily match up in this case , that is one might obtain a redundant set or an incomplete set . for 4d gravity this discrepancy has been noted in @xcite , here we see that one should be aware of possible redundancies between the constraints .    instead of averaging , we will work with an over  complete basis of constraints .",
    "possible averagings can be performed afterwards and the constraint algebra adjusted , which in particular is straightforward if the averaging coefficients are constants .     the vertex @xmath63 is dual to the triangle ( in solid lines ) and the face @xmath68 ( dashed lines ) is dual to a vertex of the triangle .",
    "@xmath90 are associated to the two edges meeting at @xmath63 in the boudary of @xmath68 .",
    "they describe the embedding of the triangle in @xmath91 , with normal @xmath92 . ]",
    "a vertex of the triangulation is shared by at least three triangles .",
    "each of them has a local frame , a basis of which being provided by the two edge vectors of the triangle meeting at the vertex , say @xmath90 , which span the tangential directions to the triangle , and an obvious choice of normal , [ normal ] n_fv = ( e_1e_2)/|e_1e_2| . in the dual graph , the edge vectors @xmath90 are equivalently identified by a pair face - vertex @xmath93 .",
    "the face @xmath68 is dual to the vertex of the triangulation , and the vertex @xmath63 labels the triangle that provides a local basis .",
    "@xmath94 are the vectors associated to the two dual edges meeting at @xmath63 in the boundary of @xmath68 . in the definition of the normal , we have assumed that @xmath90 are both outgoing ( or both ingoing ) at @xmath63 .",
    "the situation is summarized in the figure [ fig : localframe ] .",

    "note that this really is the analogue of the continuum inverse 2-metric , which we expect to appear in the dirac algebra .",
    "it naturally induces a ` space  time split ' as [ split ] ^ij & = & e^i _",
    "q_fv^ e^j_+ n_fv^i n_fv^j . here we sum over @xmath97 .",
    "this identity can be used to decompose any vector @xmath20 into components tangential to the triangle dual to @xmath63 and parallel to the normal @xmath98 . in the case of the flatness constraint / holonomy @xmath99 ,",
    "the components are exactly the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints , h^i_fv = e_^iq^_fvd_^fv + n^ih^fv .",
    "the constraints are redundant in two ways :    * local redundancy : the holonomy has three real degrees of freedom , so that the flatness constraints give three constraints per face .",
    "we have define three constraints for every face ",
    "vertex pair @xmath93 , which if the two edge vectors associated to @xmath93 are linear independent , are also independent .",
    "thus in general the constraints associated to different vertices at the same face can be related to each other .",
    "* global redundancy : the constraints generate vertex translations of the triangulation ( which can be locally embedded into 3d flat space time due to the equations of motion ) . given for instance a spherical triangulation",
    ", we can translate all vertices at once such that we either produce a global rotation or a global translation .",
    "thus in this case we have six combinations among the vertex translations , which do not change the length and the dihedral angles of the triangulation .",
    "the latter provide a parametrization of the gau  constraint reduced phase space .",
    "thus for the boundary of a tetrahedron one will have 4 ( triangulation ) vertices , hence 12 ( flatness ) constraints .",
    "only six of these are independent , fixing the dihedral angles as functions of the lengths @xcite .",
    "related is the redundancy between the flatness constraints ( on the full phase space ) induced by the integrated bianchi identity . for a spherical surface",
    "this identity implies that the holonomy of a given face can be written as a combination of the holonomies of other faces .",
    "the latter global redundancy has been overlooked in @xcite and lead there to the conclusion that it would not be possible to obtain a closed ( local ) hypersurface deformation algebra for discrete geometries .",
    "we will show that this is clearly not the case .",
    "the form of the continuum constraint algebra ( [ diracalgebra ] ) can actually be derived by geometrical considerations @xcite  it reflects the commutator of deformations of a hypersurface embedded in a higher dimensional manifold .",
    "this shows that the algebra is universal , i.e.  it is independent from the field content .",
    "moreover , given a certain set of assumptions on the number and metric interpretation of the ( adm ) phase space variables , the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints can be derived uniquely @xcite .",
    "( this work has been performed in the adm variables , we are not aware of a derivation in connection or ashtekar  barbero variables . )    we will also derive the constraint algebra by geometric considerations , for the boundary of a simplex of arbitrary dimensions , in section [ simplex ] .",
    "let us shortly explain how the form of the algebra arises .",
    "* the commutator of diffeomorphism constraints with diffeomorphism constraints gives again diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "this is due to the diffeomorphisms describing deformations in the tangent space to the spatial hypersurface .",
    "the commutator does not leave this hypersurface . *",
    "the commutator of a hamiltonian and a diffeomorphism constraint gives a hamiltonian .",
    "the normal to the hypersurface does not change under tangential deformations of this hypersurface .",
    "however a tangential vector defining the spatial diffeomorphism changes under a normal deformation ",
    "namely by the normal itself . thus we obtain a hamiltonian deformation as the commutator . * in ( [ nderiv ] ) we derived the variation of the normal under the change of hypersurface ( in this case described by the fluxes ) . due to the normalization of @xmath98",
    "the variation is orthogonal to the normal itself , that is we obtain a tangential deformation .",
    "moreover we have the inverse spatial metric appearing in ( [ nderiv ] ) which explains why it appears as a structure function .",
    "this will hold in the discrete context as well , but only for the poisson brackets between two constraints for which the space  time splittings are with respect to one and the same normal .",
    "this is the case for constraints around a single 3-valent vertex ( due to the gau  constraint ) , as we will see in the section [ 6 ] .",
    "however , when computing the algebra around a face , in the section [ 7 ] , involving different vertices , hence different spaced  time splits , we will see that the brackets are a bit more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , they remain geometrically transparent , the point being that a tangential ( or normal ) deformation to a triangle dual to a vertex @xmath63 is typically not tangential ( or normal ) when seen in the local space  time split of a different triangle , say dual to the vertex @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , a spatial deformation at @xmath63 has to be non - trivially decomposed into diffeomorphisms and hamiltonian at @xmath100 ( and the same for normal deformations ) .",
    "moreover , those geometric considerations only apply to the part of the algebra which is linear in the constraints as it refers to the geometric action that the constraints generate ( we will see that the brackets involve terms quadratic in the constraints , which however do not generate an action on the constraint hypersurface ) .",
    "we consider now the poisson algebra between two constraints .",
    "they can in general be associated to two different faces @xmath101 and vertices @xmath102 .",
    "we will denote the ( outgoing ) edges associated to @xmath93 by @xmath103 ( with indices @xmath104 ) and the ones associated to @xmath105 by @xmath106 ( with primed indices @xmath107 indices ) .",
    "one or both edges @xmath106 might coincide or be an inverse of one or both of the edges @xmath103 .",
    "however , only if @xmath108 we will have that the fluxes associated to these edges might not commute . also we need to have @xmath109 or @xmath110 ( or both ) for the poisson brackets not to vanish , in addition the two faces need to share an edge .",
    "the constraints arise as contractions of the face holonomy with either the fluxes or the normal .",
    "let us denote this choice by @xmath20 for @xmath93 and by @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "the poisson brackets can then be written as @xmath113    notice that all terms on the right hand side of this equation vanish if @xmath114 , thus the constraint algebra still closes ( as expected ) .",
    "for @xmath115 , the derivative is @xmath116 .",
    "we also need the derivative of the normal with respect to the edge vectors .",
    "this can be computed explicitly , but also found from the equations ( nn ) & = & 2 n^l = 0 + ( ne _ ) & = & e_^l + n^k ^_= 0 . taking the contraction of these equations with @xmath117 we conclude [ nderiv ] & = & -n_k q^ e_^l .    the main ingredient to evaluate all the terms in is the bracket between a flux at @xmath63 and a holonomy component for @xmath105 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath118 for the holonomy from @xmath63 to @xmath100 along the @xmath119 ( using its orientation ) and @xmath120 for the holonomy from @xmath100 to @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "this symmetry can also be translated into the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "this already changes if we add a cosmological constant , here standard regge calculus ( with flat simplices ) does break diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite , in the sense that there are no transformations that leave the action invariant and act non  trivially on solutions .",
    "an alternative discretization employing homogeneously curved simplices @xcite can however be constructed , which again does preserve the symmetries .",
    "3d gravity is a topological theory and thus one might argue that diffeomorphism symmetry can only be preserved for these kind of theories .",
    "indeed the other known examples , where diffeomorphism symmetry ( or rather reparametrization invariance ) is preserved are @xmath224 dimensional @xcite and thus also topological .",

    "the vertex translation symmetry is broken , to an order quadratic in the deficit angle ( which is proportional to the curvature ) .",
    "there are however flat solutions or even vertices which are embedded into a flat neighbourhood , for which vertex translation symmetry is extant",

    "one finds ( abelian ) constraints for the linearized theory for every vertex , which are however changed into proper equations of motion if the non  linear order is taken into account @xcite .",
    "again there are special configurations , for instance a four  valent vertex in the 3dimensional triangulated hypersurface , for which the constraints survive to any order .",
    "the reason is that such a vertex leads to a flat neighbourhood in the 4dimensional solution .",
    "indeed as was first pointed out in @xcite , there is a family of triangulations of the boundary of the 4sphere , namely boundaries of so  called stacked spheres , which lead to flat bulk solutions . for these triangulations",

    "the simplest example is the boundary of the 4simplex to which we will restrict in the following section .",
    "( these considerations easily generalize to constraints around a four  valent vertex in any triangulation . )    the work @xcite starts , as in 3d , with a discretization using holonomies and bi  vectors .",
    "this is based on a discretization from the plebanski action , which is employed in spin foams . as is well known , the 4d case is much more challenging than 3d , due to the appearance of primary and secondary simplicity constraints which are mostly ( in the discrete theory ) second class constraints .",
    "as was first pointed out in @xcite the reduction by these simplicity constraints can be performed in two stages .",
    "the first stage reduces to a phase space analogous to loop quantum gravity restricted to the dual graph of the triangulation .",

    "called gluing constraints @xcite , which are partially second class and partially first class .",
    "this last first class part are known as area constraints @xcite  this set is however empty for the boundary of a simplex .",
    "this reduction recovers the symplectic structure found directly for regge calculus @xcite and allows to express the constraints for the 4simplex in the same simple form as for the tetrahedron ( [ quadc],[linc ] ) .",
    "indeed the constraints are of the same form .",
    "because of the complications which arise in the reduction from bi  vectors and holonomies to scalar variables , we will consider only scalar variables in this work , and leave the investigation of the larger phase space for loop quantum gravity for future work . also , we want to point out that the plebanski action agrees with the ( topological ) bf action to which the simplicity constraints are added .",
    "bf theory leads again to the flatness constraints , and the corresponding quantization on a simplex has been considered in @xcite .",

    "the constraints express that the dihedral angles are actually fixed as functions of the geometry : [ 4dc1 ] c_(ij)=_ij - ^flat_ij where @xmath242 is the geometric internal dihedral angle determined from the volumina of the simplex .",
    "these constraints are abelian , again due to the schlfli identity .",
    "indeed in form they coincide with ( [ linc ] ) for 3d gravity .",
    "more generally the same constraints and phase space variables can be defined for any @xmath0simplex ( with @xmath226 ) .",
    "also the geometric action of the constraints ( [ 4dc1 ] ) is clear : it changes the geometry of the simplex such , that only @xmath238 is altered .",

    "we have seen that in the presence of the cosmological constant the discrete constraint algebra is deformed .",
    "this is due to the discretization : the structure functions refer to the geometry expressed via the lengths and volumina of finite size building blocks .",
    "the geometry of these building blocks differs in the flat and homogeneously curved case .",
    "thus , should it be possible to define constraints for discrete 4d gravity , including inhomogeneously curved geometries , one has to expect an even more complicated algebra .",
    "( this might be possible if the constraints are non  local @xcite ) .",
    "however in the limit of very small discretization scale this dependence should disappear , as in this case the local geometry is almost flat .",
    "having clarified the classical representations for the hypersurface deformation algebra we prepared ground for investigating quantum representations .",
    "these seem to be in reach for the 3d theory : on the one hand one should investigate the algebra of quantum constraints in @xcite and how this reflects the classical relations ( [ hamalg ] ) .",
    "one should be aware that terms of higher order in the constraints could appear .",
    "the algebra has structure functions , thus there is the questions of how these are ordered with respect to the constraints on the right hand side of ( [ hamalg ] ) .",
    "on the other hand one could consider quantization of the diffeomorphism constraints and the density one hamiltonian constraints , following section [ 9 ] and adapting the techniques of @xcite to a simplicial context .",
    "here we clarified that the thiemann trick is also available as an exact identity in an simplicial phase space .",
    "indeed , in this context one has to be careful to adjust numerical coefficients , that might differ from the continuum formulas .",
    "similar considerations in 4d are also possible .    considering density one hamiltonians , density two hamiltonians or the flatness constraints will influence how degenerate configurations are treated .",
    "this is still an open question of research @xcite .",
    "this question is related to the choice of boundary conditions for ` zero spatial slices ' and also the question whether one has necessarily to sum over orientations @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite the boundary conditions for the density two hamiltonian indeed impose that the physical wave functions includes both orientations . thus investigating other choices for the density could uncover general mechanisms , that might also be applicable to bouncing cosmologies or singularity resolutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore for the quantization of the density one hamiltonians factor ordering ambiguities arise that are analogous to those in the 4d theory .",
    "these might be much easier to resolve in the 3d theory , so that lessons can be drawn for the 4d case .",
    "as we have discussed in 4d we can consider a topological sector of the discretized theory that admits exact constraints .",
    "these allow to define a hypersurface deformation algebra , which we here considered for the boundary of a simplex .",
    "let us point out that even finding the physical wave function for the simplex would mean considerable progress for the 4d theory : as in the 3d theory this physical wave function would constitute the amplitude for the simplex form which we can built the path integral , that is spin foam model , of simplicial gravity .",
    "such a physical wave function would also include information on the measure factors , which in 4d are not specified even for configurations describing the classically flat sector @xcite .",
    "this of course would strengthen very much the connection between canonical loop quantum gravity and spin foam models , and clarify the role of diffeomorphism symmetry and the related slavnov ",
    "taylor identities along the lines of @xcite .    to this end",
    "it would be beneficial to investigate more in detail the simplicial version of the hamiltonian constraints @xcite , which has been started in @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether one can find a unique quantum representation of a given simplex boundary deformation algebra or whether there exist more than one representation .",
    "an answer to this question would be useful for canonical quantization as well as the path integral approach .",
    "we thank laurent freidel for discussions which motivated this work .",
    "research at perimeter institute is supported by the government of canada through industry canada and by the province of ontario through the ministry of research and innovation .",
