    "a famous example is the so - called _ six degrees of separation _ in social networks @xcite .",
    "a large number of real networks are referred to as _ scale - free _ because the probability distribution @xmath2 of the number of links per node ( also known as the degree distribution ) satisfies a power law @xmath3 with the degree exponent @xmath4 varying in the range @xmath5 @xcite . in view of their small - world property",

    "@xcite , it was already a big step to go from the computation of the fractal dimension of a geometrical object to that of a network via the box - counting approach of fractal analysis .",
    "in this paper , we propose a new box - covering algorithm to compute the generalised fractal dimensions of a network .",
    "this is the next step to move from fractal analysis to multifractal analysis of complex networks .",
    "we first adapt the random sequential box covering algorithm @xcite to calculate the fractal dimension of the human protein - protein interaction network as well as that of its skeleton .",
    "we next propose a box covering algorithm for multifractal analysis of networks in section 2 .",
    "this algorithm is then used to calculate in section 3 the generalized fractal dimensions @xmath0 of generated examples of three classes of theoretical networks , namely scale - free networks , small - world networks and random networks , and one kind of real networks , namely protein - protein interaction networks of different species .",
    "the methods to generate the theoretical networks are described .",
    "the multifractal behaviour of these networks based on the computed generalised fractal dimensions @xmath0 is then discussed .",
    "the possible variation of @xmath0 due to changes in the parameters of the theoretical network models is also investigated .",
    "some conclusions are then drawn in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the box covering methods for calculating the fractal dimension of complex networks and the traditional fixed - size box counting algorithms used for multifractal analysis .",
    "we then present our new approach for multifractal analysis of complex networks in detail",
    ".      box covering is a basic tool to estimate the fractal dimension of conventional fractal objects embedded in the euclidean space .",
    "the euclidean metric is not relevant for complex networks .",
    "a more natural metric is the shortest path length between two nodes , which is defined as the number of edges in a shortest path connecting them .",
    "shortest paths play an important role in the transport and communication within a network .",
    "it is useful to represent all the shortest path lengths of a network as a matrix @xmath6 in which the entry @xmath7 is the length of the shortest path from node @xmath8 to node @xmath9 .",
    "the maximum value in the matrix @xmath6 is called the network diameter , which is the longest path between any two nodes in the network .",
    "@xcite studied the fractality and self - similarity of complex networks by using box covering techniques .",
    "they proposed several possible box covering algorithms @xcite and applied them to a number of models and real - world networks .",
    "@xcite introduced another method called the random sequential box covering method , which can be described as follows :    for a given network , let @xmath10 be the number of boxes of radius @xmath11 which are needed to cover the entire network .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath12 is then given by @xmath13by measuring the distribution of @xmath10 for different box sizes , the fractal dimension @xmath12 can be obtained by power law fitting of the distribution . this algorithm has the following steps",
    "@xcite :    1 .   select a node randomly at each step ; this node serves as a seed which will be the center of a box .",
    "2 .   search the network by distance @xmath11 from the seed and cover all nodes which are found but have not been covered yet .",
    "assign the newly covered nodes to the new box .",
    "if no newly covered nodes have been found , then this box is discarded .",
    "3 .   repeat ( i ) and ( ii ) until all nodes in the network have been assigned to their respective boxes .    to obtain the _ skeleton _ of a complex network , we firstly need to calculate the edge betweenness of all the edges in this network .",
    "the betweenness @xmath14 also referred to as load @xcite , is defined as @xmath15where @xmath1 is the number of nodes , @xmath16 is the number of shortest paths connecting nodes @xmath9 and @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is the number of shortest paths connecting nodes @xmath9 and @xmath17 and passing through edge @xmath8 .",
    "similar to a minimum spanning tree , a skeleton is constructed so that edges which have the highest betweenness and do not form loops are selected @xcite .",
    "the remaining edges in the original network are referred to as shortcuts that contribute to loop formation . in other words ,",
    "the distance between any two nodes in the original network may increase in the skeleton .",
    "for example , in the human protein - protein interaction network , the largest distance between any two nodes in the original network is 21 while the largest distance between any two nodes in its skeleton is 27 .    as an example",
    ", we used the above algorithm to estimate the fractal dimension of the human protein - protein interaction network as well as that of its skeleton . the result is shown in fig .",
    "1 . when we applied the box covering algorithm on the skeleton , more boxes were needed for each fixed box radius @xmath11 .",
    "the increasing rate of the number @xmath10 of boxes varies when the size @xmath11 of the box increases .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath11 is smaller , the number of boxes needed is not much different for both the original network and its skeleton ; but when @xmath11 is larger , many more boxes are needed to cover the skeleton than the original network .      * *  * * most well - known fractals such as the cantor set , the koch curve and the sierpinski triangle are homogeneous since they consist of a geometrical figure repeated on an ever - reduced scale . for these objects ,",
    "the fractal dimension is the same on all scales .",
    "however , real - world fractals may not be homogeneous ; there is rarely an identical motif repeated on all scales .",
    "two objects might have the same fractal dimension and yet look completely different .",
    "real - world fractals possess rich scaling and self - similarity properties that can change from point to point , thus can have different dimensions at different scales .",
    "the present paper investigates these properties on complex networks .",
    "especially we develop tools to determine whether they are simple fractals or multifractals , and how different two networks could be even though they have the same fractal dimension . in other words",
    ", we aim to develop an approach for multifractal analysis of complex networks .",
    "the most common algorithm of multifractal analysis is the fixed - size box - counting algorithm @xcite .",
    "for a given probability measure @xmath19 with support set @xmath20 in a metric space , we consider the partition sum @xmath21^{q},\\ ,   \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath22 is a real number and the sum runs over all different non - overlapping boxes @xmath23 of a given size @xmath24 in a covering of the support @xmath20 .",

    ", the number @xmath53 also referred to as the hlder exponent , is the singularity strength of the box .",

    "in recent years , with the development of technology , the research on networks has shifted away from the analysis of single small graphs and the properties of individual vertices or edges within such graphs to consideration of large - scale statistical properties of complex networks .",
    "newman @xcite reviewed some latest works on the structure and function of networked systems such as the internet , the world wide web , social networks and a variety of biological networks . besides reviewing empirical studies , the author also focused on a number of statistical properties of networks including path lengths , degree distributions , clustering and resilience . in this paper , we pay attention to another aspect  of networks , namely their multifractality .",
    "we aim to develop a tool based on this property to characterize and classify real - world networks .",
    "it has been shown that many real complex networks share distinctive characteristics that differ in many ways from random and regular networks @xcite .",
    "fundamental properties of complex networks such small - world effect and the scale - free degree distribution have attracted much attention recently .",
    "these properties have in fact been found in many naturally occurring networks . in subsections 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 ,",
    "we generate scale - free networks using the ba model of barabasi and albert @xcite , small - world networks using the nw model of newman and watts @xcite , then random networks using the er model of erds and rnyi @xcite respectively .",
    "we then apply our modified fixed - size box counting algorithm to analyze the multifractal behavior of these networks .",
    "we use the elegant and simple ba model of barabasi and albert barabsi1999 to generate scale - free networks .",
    "the origin of the scale - free behavior in many systems can be traced back to this ba model , which correctly predicts the emergence of scaling exponent .",
    "the ba model consists of two mechanisms : initially , the network begins with a seed network of @xmath106 nodes , where @xmath107 and the degree of each node in the initial network should be at least 1 , otherwise it will always remain disconnected from the rest of the network . for example , here we start with an initial network of 5 nodes .",
    "its interaction matrix is @xmath108we then add one node to this initial network at a time .",
    "each new node is connected to @xmath106 existing nodes with a probability that is proportional to the number of links that the existing nodes already have .",
    "formally , the probability @xmath109 that the new node is connected to node @xmath8 is @xmath110where @xmath111 is the degree of node @xmath8 .",
    "so hubs tend to quickly accumulate even more links , while nodes with only a few links are unlikely to be chosen as destination for a new link .    in this paper ,",
    "these scale - free networks are generated based on the same seed which is the initial network of 5 nodes . for better comparison , in each step",
    ", one node will be added into the network with one link .",
    "then we apply the modified fixed - size box counting method on them to detect their multifractal behavior .    in fig .",
    "4 . we can see that scale - free networks are multifractal by the shape of the @xmath0 curves .",
    "the @xmath0 functions of these networks decrease sharply after the peak .",
    "an explanation is that , in a scale - free network , there are several nodes which are known as hubs that have a large number of edges connected to them , so the edge density around the areas near the hubs is larger than the remaining parts of the network .",
    "we summarize the numerical results in table 1 including the number of nodes , number of edges , diameter , power law exponent @xmath4 , maximum value of @xmath0 , limit of @xmath0 , and @xmath112 .",
    "from these results we could see that scale free networks with larger size ( more nodes and more edges ) are likely to have larger values of the maximum and limit of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the function @xmath0 increases with the size of a scale - free network .",
    "an explanation for this situation is that larger scale - free networks usually have more hubs which make the structure of the network more complex .",
    "scale - free networks show a power - law degree distribution of @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the probability of a node randomly chosen with degree @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown in [ 6 , 7 ] that when @xmath113 the average degree diverges ; while for @xmath114 the standard deviation of the degree diverges .",
    "it has been found that the degree exponent @xmath4 usually varies in the range of @xmath5 @xcite for most scale - free networks .",
    "accordingly , we computed the power - law exponent of these generated scale - free networks .",
    "the results show that there does nt seem to be any clear relationship between power law and the maximum of @xmath115 limit of @xmath0 or @xmath112 .      in 1998 ,",
    "watts and strogatz @xcite proposed a single - parameter small - world network model that bridges the gap between a regular network and a random graph . with the ws small - world model , one can link a regular lattice with pure random network by a semirandom network with high clustering coefficient and short average path length .",
    "later on , newman and watts @xcite modified the original ws model . in the nw model , instead of rewiring links between nodes , extra links called shortcuts are added between pairs of nodes chosen at random , but no links are removed from the existing network .",
    "the nw model is equivalent to the ws model for small p and sufficiently large n , but easier to proceed .    in this paper",
    ", we use the nw model as follows .",
    "firstly , we should select three parameters : the dimension @xmath116 which is the number of nodes in a graph ; the mean degree @xmath17 ( assumed to be an even integer ) , which is the number of nearest - neighbors to connect ; and the probability @xmath117 of adding a shortcut in a given row , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 . secondly , we follow two steps :    1 .",
    "construct a regular ring lattice .",
    "for example , if the nodes are named @xmath120 , there is an edge @xmath121 between node @xmath122 and @xmath123 if and only if @xmath124 for @xmath125 $ ] ; 2 .   add a new edge between nodes @xmath122 and",
    "@xmath123 with probability @xmath117 .    an illustration of this generating process is given in fig .",
    "the upper left figure corresponds to the probability @xmath126 .",
    "it is a regular network containing 20 nodes and each node has two neighbors on both sides .",
    "in other words , in this regular network , each node has four edges .",
    "all the nodes and edges are shown in blue .",
    "then we start generating small - world networks based on this regular network . the upper right figure of fig .",
    "5 corresponds to the probability @xmath127 one edge is added into the network which is colored in black .",
    "the network then becomes a small - world network .",
    "the bottom left figure corresponds to the probability @xmath128 seven black edges are added into the original regular network and it is also a small - world network .",
    "the bottom right figure corresponds to the probability @xmath129 ; 10 black edges are added into the original small - world network and this time it becomes a random network .    in this paper , we firstly generated a regular network which contains 5000 nodes and 250,000 edges .",
    "each node has 50 edges on each side .",
    "then we apply the modified fixed - size box counting method on this regular network .",
    "the numerical results are shown in the last row of table 2 .",
    "both the maximum value of @xmath0 and the limit of @xmath0 are equal to one , thus @xmath130 .",
    "this is because regular networks are not fractal , and they have dimension one .",
    "secondly , for better comparison , we generated ten small - world networks based on a regular network of 5000 nodes with 5 edges on each side of a node . during the generation ,",
    "when the probability @xmath117 increases , more edges are added into the original regular network .",
    "then we apply the modified fixed - size box counting method on them to detect their multifractal behavior .",
    "we summarize the numerical results in table 2 , which includes the number of nodes , number of edges , diameter , probability p ( the generating parameter ) , maximum value of @xmath0 and @xmath112 .",
    "these results indicate that , when @xmath117 increases , more edges are added and accordingly both the maximum and limit values of @xmath0 increase .    in fig .",
    "6 we can see that the @xmath0 curve of a regular network whose probability @xmath126 during generation is a straight line with the value of @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath0 curves of the other small - world networks are also approximately straight lines but with different @xmath0 values .",
    "so these networks are not multifractal .",
    "another interesting property is apparent when @xmath131 , in which case @xmath0 increases along with the value of @xmath117 .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath117 increases , more edges are added to the network , and both the maximum and limit values of @xmath0 and limit of @xmath0 increase .",
    "the values of @xmath112 are all within the error range , confirming that the @xmath0 curves are straight lines .",
    "the erds - rnyi random graph model @xcite  is the oldest and one of the most studied techniques to generate complex networks .",
    "we generate random networks based on the er model @xcite :     1 .",
    "start with @xmath1 isolated nodes ; 2 .",
    "pick up every pair of nodes and connect them by an edge with probability @xmath132    usually , the results of this generation are separated subnetworks . in this work",
    ", we just consider the largest connected part as the network to work on and apply the modified fixed - size box counting method to detect their multifractal behaviors .",
    "we then summarize the numerical results in table 3 including the number of nodes , number of edges , diameter , probability @xmath117 ( the generating parameter ) , maximum value of @xmath0 , limit of @xmath0 , and @xmath112 .",
    "these results indicate that there is no clear relationship between @xmath0 and the size of the random network .    in fig .",
    "7 , we can see that the @xmath0 curves of random networks decrease slowly after the peak and the changes could be seen by the values of @xmath133 .",
    "this pattern occurs bcause , during the generating process , nodes are randomly connected with probability @xmath117 , and few hubs may exist . compared with scale - free networks ,",
    "this decrease supports the claim that , in random networks , edges are distributed more symmetrically . *  *    * * remark * : * in the present study , we consider the generalized fractal dimensions @xmath0 to determine whether the object is multifactal from the shape of @xmath0 . for a monofractal system , which has the same scaling behavior at any point",
    ", @xmath0 should be a constant independent of @xmath134 , while for a multifractal , the @xmath0 should be a non - increasing nonlinear curve as @xmath22 increases .",
    "however , in our results , an anomalous behavior is observed : the @xmath0 curves increase at the beginning when @xmath135 .",
    "this anomalous behavior has also been observed in bos et al.@xcite , smith and lange @xcite , fernndez et al .",
    "@xcite . some reasons for this behavior have been suggested , including that the boxes contain few elements @xcite , or the small scaling regime covers less than a decade so that we can not extrapolate the box counting results for the partition function to zero box size @xcite . in encountering the anomalous spectra of @xmath0",
    ", we tried another method of multifractal analysis called the sand - box method , but the linear regression fittings are not satisfactory .",
    "we therefore used the modified fixed - size box counting algorithm in this research . for the purpose of detecting the multifractality of complex networks ,",
    "we adopt the anomalous spectra of @xmath0 and focus on the decreasing parts which are presented in figs . 4 to 8 .",
    "our fractal and multifractal analyses are based on connected networks which do not have separated parts or isolated nodes . in order to apply them to protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks ,",
    "some preparation is needed in advance .",
    "firstly , we need to find the largest connected part of each data set . for this purpose",
    "many tools and methods could be used . in our study",
    ", we adopt the cytoscape @xcite which is an open bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and analyzing network graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges . in using cytoscape , we could get the largest connected part of each interacting ppi data set and this connected part is the network on which fractal and multifractal analyses are performed .",
    "the protein - protein interaction data we used here are mainly downloaded from two databases : the ppi networks of drosophila melanogaster ( fruit fly ) , c. elegans , arabidopsis thaliana and schizosaccharomyces",
    "pombe are downloaded from biogrid @xcite .",
    "the ppi networks of s. cerevisiae ( baker s yeast ) , e. coli and h. pylori are download from dip @xcite .",
    "we also use the same human ppi network data as in @xcite .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0 spectra for eight ppi networks of different organisms as shown in fig .",
    "8 . from these @xmath0 curves",
    ", we see that all ppi networks are multifractal and there are two clear groupings of organisms based on the peak values of their @xmath0 curves .",
    "the first group includes human , drosophila melanogaster , s. cerevisiae , and c. elegans .",
    "the second group just includes two bacteria e.coli and h. pylori .",
    "we also see that the ppi networks of the eight organisms have similar shape for the @xmath0 curves .",
    "they all increase when @xmath136 $ ] , and reach their peak values around @xmath137 , then decrease sharply as @xmath138 and finally reach their limit value when @xmath139 .",
    "so we can take @xmath140 and use @xmath141 to verify how the @xmath0 function changes along each curve .",
    "we summarize the corresponding numerical results in table 4 .",
    "after analyzing a variety of real complex networks , song et al .",
    "song2005 found that they consist of self - repeating patterns on all length scales , i.e. , complex networks have self - similar structures .",
    "they found that the box - counting method is a proper tool to unfold the self - similar properties of complex networks and to further investigate network properties .",
    "however , describing objects by a single fractal dimension is a limitation of fractal analysis , especially when the networks exhibit a multifractal behavior .",
    "multifractal analysis is a useful way to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns .",
    "it allows the computation of a set of fractal dimensions , especially the generalized fractal dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "a modified algorithm for analyzing the multifractal behavior of complex networks is proposed in this paper .",
    "this algorithm is applied on generated scale - free networks , small - world networks and random networks as well as protein - protein interaction networks .",
    "the numerical results indicate that multifractality exists in scale - free networks and ppi networks , while for small - world networks and random networks their multifractality is not clear - cut , particularly for small - world networks generated by the nw model .",
    "furthermore , for scale - free networks , the values of @xmath0 increase when the size of the network increases because larger scale - free networks usually have more hubs which make the structure of the network more complex . however , for random networks there is no clear relationship between @xmath0 and the size of the network . *",
    "*  * * the quantity @xmath142 has been used to investigate how @xmath0 changes .",
    "larger @xmath105 means the network s edge distribution is more uneven ; while smaller @xmath105 means the network s edge distribution is more symmetrical , which is the case for random networks .",
    "these results support that the algorithm proposed in this paper is a suitable and effective tool to perform multifractal analysis of complex networks .",
    "especially , in conjunction with the derived quantities from @xmath0 , the method and algorithm provide a needed tool to cluster and classify real networks such as the protein - protein interaction networks of organisms .",
