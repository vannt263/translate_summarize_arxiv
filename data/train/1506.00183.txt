    "one of the main challenges in physics today is the search for a quantum theory of gravity ( qtg ) . on the theoretical front ,",
    "one of the major problems is that the introduction of gravity into quantum field theories appears to spoil their renormalizability , and from the experimental point of view , the major difficulty is the lack of experimentally accesible phenomena that could shed light on a possible route to qtg .",
    "this situation gives rise to the possibility of existence of other fundamental interactions in nature @xcite , thus providing a strong motivation to the study of gravity at short ranges .",
    "the newton s law has never been tested at distances below of @xmath1 , thus opening the possibility of studying extra finite range ( non - newtonian ) gravitational interactions . in this scenario",
    "different phenomenological approaches have been considered , for example extra yukawa - type forces @xcite .",
    "theories with large extra spatial dimensions have also been studied .",
    "a proposal consistent with string theory is due to arkani - hamed , dimoupoulos and dvali ( add ) , in which gravity departs from newton s inverse square law at scales which could be as large as a millimeter @xcite .",
    "add conjectures the existence of two or more additional dimensions in which gravity , but not the strong or electroweak forces , might be acting , diluting itself by spreading its lines of force into these extra dimensions .",
    "essentially , this would explain the apparent weakness of gravity .",
    "considering the progress that has been achieved recently in neutron physics experiments , it has been proposed that they can reveal deviations from newton s law at short distances .",
    "for example , nesvizhevsky and co - workers use the best experimental measurements performed with neutron scattering experiments to give constraints for the hypothetical yukawa - type force @xcite , and on the other hand , frank and co - workers propose that slow neutron scattering off atomic nuclei with null spin may provide an experimental test for large extra spatial dimensional gravity @xcite , but no experiment in this regard has been performed so far .",
    "note that in these works the authors study the quantum effects caused by an extra short - range gravitational potential .",
    "in this paper we adopt a more fundamental point of view .",
    "the high energy behaviour of quantum fields is intimately connected with the structure of spacetime at short distances .",
    "for example , loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) asserts that continuous classical spacetime is replaced by quantum spin networks on small scales .",
    "polymer quantization ( pq ) is a background independent quantization scheme that is deployed in lqg . in this",
    "programme the notion of discreteness is built - in , and consequently the momentum operator @xmath2 is not realized directly as in schrdinger quantum mechanics , but arises indirectly through the translation operator @xmath3 .",
    "pq has been used to study quantum gravitational corrections to temporal dynamics @xcite and to statistical thermodynamics @xcite of simple quantum systems . in this paper",
    "we use pq to study the problem of a particle bouncing on a perfectly reflecting surface under the influence of earth s gravitational field ( described by newton s law ) , that we have called _ the polymer bouncer_. in this scenario , deviations from the usual quantum effects are induced by the spatial discreteness , but not by a new short - range gravitational interaction .",
    "recent high - sensitivity experiments with thermal neutrons free falling in the gravitational field , called granit , demonstrate that the energy spectrum in the gravitational field s direction is quantized @xcite . this kind of experiments may offer an opportunity to confront observation with signatures of quantum gravitational effects . to this end in [ polymerbouncer ]",
    "we solve the problem of the polymer bouncer in an analytical fashion , and we evaluate numerically the corresponding energy levels . the polymer - schrdinger transition is discussed in [ pstransition ] . in [ granit ]",
    "we predict an upper bound to the length scale of the polymer theory by confronting our results with the maximal precision of the granit experiment . in [ smallvibrations , transitionrate ]",
    "we find polymer corrections for both , the probability of transitions between levels induced by small vibrations and the probability of spontaneous emission in the quadrupole approximation , respectively .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in [ conclusions ] .",
    "we shall consider the problem of a polymer particle of mass @xmath4 bouncing on a perfectly reflecting surface ( at @xmath5 ) under the influence of earth s gravitational field : @xmath6 .",
    "for the purposes of this work we will make the following assumptions .",
    "firstly we consider that it is reasonable to keep a constant value for @xmath7 because the small size of the experiments @xcite , and secondly we assume that the weak equivalence principle is valid . to tackle this problem ,",
    "we restrict the dynamics to an equispaced lattice @xmath8 .",
    "the spectrum of the position operator , @xmath9 , consists of a countable selection of points from the real line , which is analogous to the graph covering 3-manifolds in lqg . here",
    "@xmath10 is regarded as a fundamental length scale of the theory .    as in the standard case ,",
    "the potential for this problem is defined by @xmath11 the wave function @xmath12 of a polymer bouncer obeys the stationary polymer schrdinger equation for the vertical motion along vertical axis @xmath13 where we have defined the following dimensionless quantities @xmath14 with @xmath15 the characteristic gravitational length @xcite . the appropriate solution for this problem is realized through the following boundary conditions : @xmath16 must vanish asymptotically as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 because of the mirror at @xmath19 .    in most cases , second - order linear difference equations with variable coefficients",
    "can not be solved in closed form .",
    "fortunately , for the special case of the difference equation ( [ polschreq ] ) it is possible to obtain an analytic solution in a simple fashion @xcite . the most convenient approach for finding the solution of difference equations with polynomial coefficients is the method of the generating function .",
    "let @xmath20 be the generating function for the solution of [ polschreq ] .",
    "note that ( [ generatingf ] ) is not a generating function in the strict sense but a laurent series , which is uniformly convergent , and thus we can differentiate each term .",

    "after relabeling the index in [ solgeneratingf ] , a simple comparison with [ generatingf ] shows that the decaying solution of [ polschreq ] is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the appropriate normalization factor . by using the recurrence relation for bessel functions , @xmath28 , one can further check that [ wavefunc ] correctly solves the time - independent polymer schrdinger equation ( [ polschreq ] ) .",
    "this generating function approach is not suitable for determining the growing solution of [ polschreq ] , but it is well known that the neumann function @xmath29 also satisfies the recursion equation for bessel functions .",
    "it does not however , represent a physical solution for this problem .",
    "the second boundary condition , @xmath18 , implies that @xmath30 must be chosen as a root of the bessel function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( not necessarily an integer ) .",

    "unfortunately [ polenergyspec ] can not be solved analitically , but it can be studied numerically for arbitrary values of @xmath36 . using the quantization condition ( [ polenergyspec ] ) , we can compute the normalization factor in a simple fashion .",
    "one obtains @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the derivative of the bessel function with respect to its order .",
    "the substitution of @xmath27 into the polymer wave function [ wavefunc ] establishes the normalized polymer wave function .",
    "now we proceed with the analysis of the polymer energy spectrum .    for",

    "the case @xmath44 exhibits difficulties arising from the polymer behaviour , which we discuss later .",
    "our results show that the polymer energy levels display a negative shift with respect to the energy levels of the quantum bouncer .",
    "such negative shift in energy can be understood by studying the dynamics of the polymer bouncer . the heisenberg equation of motion for the operator @xmath45 yields @xmath46 = - m g \\cos \\frac{p \\lambda}{\\hbar } \\geq - m g \\label{heiseqmot}\\ ] ] where the inequality is established using the domain of the momentum in the polymer case , i.e. @xmath47 $ ] . in the first order of approximation , [ heiseqmot ]",
    "becomes @xmath48 .",
    "so , clasically , an additional @xmath49 dependent force acts on the particle which decreases the energy of the system .",
    "quantum mechanically , the negative shift is in agreement with the correction term of the regularized @xmath50 operator in the polymer theory for @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 with the assumption that the fundamental length is very small compared with the characteristic gravitational length , @xmath53 , the energy shift can be roughly estimated . in first order perturbation theory ,",
    "the enery shift becomes @xmath54 the averages in this expression can be easily computed by using the quantum - mechanical wave function [ waveequation1 ] .",
    "the final result is @xmath55 which is in a close agreement with the results reported in [ table ] . due to the lack of precision in numerical calculations for the case @xmath56 in [ polenergyspec ] , we have employed the energy shift of [ energyshift2 ] in [ table ] only for this case .",
    "the energy spectrum of a quantum bouncer also has been studied in the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) framework @xcite . in this case",
    "the modification induced by a minimal length @xmath57 on the energy spectrum is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a gup parameter .",

    "such opposite tendency is also present for the energy spectrum for a particle in a box , as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "another important consequence of the commutator in [ heiseqmot ] is the modification of the position - momentum uncertainty relation .",
    "we know that for two operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the identity @xmath62 \\right\\rangle \\vert ^{2 } / 4 $ ] holds irrespective of the quantization scheme @xcite . in the polymer framework",

    "suggests that polymer quantum mechanics at short enough wave lengths ( of the order of @xmath64 ) can exhibit classical behaviour .",
    "this result has a strong resemblance to the one found , on a different setup , by magueijo and smolin in deformed special relativity @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "t hooft has discussed the possibility of a deterministic quantum mechanics at planck scale , supplemented with a dissipation mechanism , giving rise to the standard quantum mechanical behaviour at larger scales @xcite .",
    "has been used to derive a new mass - temperature relation for schwarzschild ( micro ) black holes @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by comparing the polymer and quantum density profiles for different energy levels and different values of @xmath42 .",

    "we expect a close agreement between the polymer and quantum - mechanical density profiles for the case @xmath70 , however in [ densityprofiles ] we observe that this occurs already for @xmath71 . when the gravitational length is of the order of the fundamental length ( @xmath44 ) the polymer distribution departs from its quantum - mechanical counterpart , and the polymer effects become important . from [ s2n10 ]",
    "we can infer that the most significant polymer effects are for high energies and @xmath44 , as expected .",
    "in physics , if a new theory is considered more general that the former , it must yield accurate results not only in the new scale but at the former one as well . in this sense",
    ", we know that newtonian mechanics can be recovered from relativistic mechanics in the domain of low velocities compared with the speed of light in vacuum . regarding the quantum - classical transition the problem is more subtle , given that the conceptual framework of these theories are fundamentally different @xcite . in the problem at hand one expects that if the lattice spacing @xmath10 is taken to be sufficiently small , the polymer formulation should reduce to the schrdinger representation .",
    "however , this is a delicate issue because @xmath10 is regarded as a nonzero fundamental length scale of the polymer theory , and it can not be removed when working in the polymer hilbert space @xmath72 , , with @xmath73 corresponding haar measure , and @xmath74 the real line endowed with a discrete topology ] no matter how small @xmath10 is @xcite .",

    "note that this approximation is valid even if we take @xmath10 several orders of magnitude larger than the planck lenght .",
