    ". figure [ fig1]c shows this region in greater detail with the membrane ( i ) lying in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane and ( ii ) tilted by 0.4 mrad about the @xmath24-axis .",
    "the behavior in fig .  [ fig1]c(ii ) is ubiquitous among multiplets of higher - order transverse modes : tilting the membrane lifts the multiplet degeneracy , with modes of greater spatial extent along the membrane slope ( @xmath23 in this case ) perturbed the most .    the central result of this article is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d , which shows a high - resolution scan of the region indicated by the dotted box in fig .",
    "this data demonstrates that the apparent crossings between the various optical modes are avoided , and that at their anticrossings @xmath29 is purely quadratic with @xmath11 substantially greater than 30 khz / nm@xmath30 .",

    "we note that if the membrane is positioned so that two modes realize a quadratic coupling , other modes will still realize a linear coupling . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d this occurs at the position @xmath39 nm : here the eigenmodes formed by the tem@xmath33 and tem@xmath27 modes exhibit quadratic coupling while the tem@xmath40 mode s coupling is linear .",
    "this means that lasers tuned to different eigenmodes can simultaneously exploit different forms of the optomechanical coupling .",
    "we can understand the origin of these features by noting that avoided crossings generally reflect a broken symmetry that prevents eigenmodes from becoming degenerate .",
    "an ideal empty fabry - perot cavity possesses symmetry that allows degeneracy between transverse modes , but in our device we expect this symmetry to be broken for two reasons : the curved wavefronts of the cavity modes may not overlap perfectly with the flat membrane ( e.g. , if the membrane is tilted or displaced from the cavity waist ) , and the empty cavity itself may be slightly asymmetric ( e.g. , owing to imperfect form of the end mirrors ) .    to make a quantitative analysis of the cavity spectrum and the features in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b - d , we developed a perturbative solution of the helmholtz equation to calculate the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of a symmetric optical cavity into which a dielectric slab is placed at an arbitrary location and tilt .",
    "as described elsewhere@xcite , the empty - cavity eigenfrequencies are perturbed by an amount proportional to the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the @xmath44 unperturbed eigenmode of the cavity and the integral is taken over the volume of the membrane .",
    "applying this theory to the four cavity modes of interest ( the singlet and triplet modes ) quantitatively reproduces the large - scale ( @xmath45ghz ) sinusoidal shape of @xmath29 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b if we assume re[@xmath46@xmath47 and @xmath48 nm ( black lines ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the fitted and nominal values of @xmath49 presumably reflects a combination of fabrication tolerances ( @xmath50 nm ) and the limits of a first - order perturbation theory that includes only four eigenmodes .",

    "this tunability is important because in some situations it may be desirable to decrease @xmath11 in order to relax other experimental constraints .",
    "for example , if @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is small enough the membrane s motion may result in non - adiabatic transfer of light between the two cavity modes via landau - zener - stckelberg - like transitions.@xcite    the tunability of @xmath11 is illustrated in fig .",

    "variations in @xmath57 can also arise from optical absorption in the membrane .",

    "the small - scale ( @xmath76 ) variations in @xmath59 are reproducible and periodic , and presumably arise from mixing with higher - order modes . to estimate the contribution to @xmath59 from absorption in the membrane ( as opposed to mixing with higher - order modes )",
    ", we extract the fourier component of @xmath59 corresponding to the overlap between the membrane and the intracavity standing wave .",
    "this sets an upper limit of im@xmath77 at @xmath70 nm .",
    "the lower optical absorption observed here should enable the use of cavities with higher @xmath78 while decreasing the quantum noise in the cavity and the heating of the membrane .",

    "this scheme requires higher finesse and smaller values of @xmath81 and @xmath5 ( which could be realized by patterning the membrane into a free standing pad supported by narrow beams ) , as well as cryogenic pre - cooling to @xmath82  mk .",

    "<S> a major goal in optomechanics is to observe and control quantum behavior in a system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom ; however , the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane allow us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling . </S>",
    "<S> these include cavity detunings that are ( to lowest order ) linear , quadratic , or quartic in the membrane s displacement , and a cavity finesse that is linear in ( or independent of ) the membrane s displacement . </S>",
    "<S> all these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range _ in situ _ ; in particular , we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices . as a result of these advances , </S>",
    "<S> the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane s mechanical energy .    </S>",
    "<S> nearly all optomechanical systems realized to date can be characterized by a linear relationship between the optical cavity s detuning @xmath0 and the displacement of the mechanical element @xmath1.@xcite in the classical regime this `` linear '' optomechanical coupling has enabled powerful laser cooling and sensitive displacement readout of the mechanical element . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath2 increases this linear coupling becomes stronger , and it should become possible to observe quantum effects such as laser - cooling to the mechanical ground state@xcite , quantum - limited measurements of force and displacement@xcite , and the production of squeezed light.@xcite in the quantum regime , however , the _ form _ of the optomechanical coupling plays a crucial role in determining which phenomena are observable . </S>",
    "<S> for example , linear coupling provides a continuous readout of @xmath1 , and so precludes a direct measurement of one of the most striking features associated with the quantum regime : the quantization of the mechanical oscillator s energy .    </S>",
    "<S> one device that has demonstrated a nonlinear optomechanical coupling consists of a thin dielectric membrane placed inside a fabry - perot cavity . with the membrane positioned at a node ( or antinode ) of the intracavity standing wave , @xmath3 to lowest order . </S>",
    "<S> this `` quadratic '' optomechanical coupling is compatible with a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) readout of the membrane s energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the membrane s resonant frequency and @xmath6 is the membrane s phonon number . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct schemes have been proposed for using this quadratic coupling to demonstrate the quantization of the membrane s energy . </S>",
    "<S> both schemes assume the membrane is laser - cooled to mean phonon number @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical estimates indicate this level of cooling should be feasible for the device described here , provided it is pre - cooled cryogenically.@xcite    the goal of the first scheme is to monitor @xmath6 with resolution sufficient to observe individual quantum jumps . </S>",
    "<S> this is not feasible with the devices demonstrated to date , and would require substantial improvements to the quadratic coupling strength @xmath8 , the membrane s optical absorption , and the membrane s mechanical properties .    in the second scheme </S>",
    "<S> , the laser - cooled membrane would be mechanically driven from the ground state to a large - amplitude coherent state with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic coupling would then be used to monitor the membrane s energy with resolution sufficient to resolve fluctuations @xmath10 corresponding to the shot noise of the membrane s phonons . </S>",
    "<S> detailed calculations@xcite show that this second scheme is considerably less demanding than the first , though it still requires substantial improvements to @xmath11 and the membrane s optical absorption .    </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate an optomechanical device in which @xmath11 is increased by at least three orders of magnitude , while the membrane s optical absorption is substantially decreased . </S>",
    "<S> the device satisfies the requirements for observing phonon shot noise at a bath temperature @xmath12 mk , and represents substantial progress toward observing individual quantum jumps . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement in @xmath11 is achieved by exploiting the full spectrum of the optical cavity s transverse modes , which exhibits numerous avoided crossings as a function of the membrane s position . </S>",
    "<S> these crossings were not considered in previous work , which assumed a one - dimensional model of the cavity and only a single transverse optical mode .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to increased @xmath11 , we demonstrate considerable flexibility within a single device : ( i ) @xmath11 can be varied _ in situ _ by adjusting the position and tilt of the membrane ; ( ii ) it is possible to tune @xmath11 to zero , thereby realizing a purely quartic optomechanical coupling @xmath13 ; ( iii ) the gradient of the cavity relaxation @xmath14 can be tuned over a wide range or set to zero ; and ( iv ) cavity modes with different forms of @xmath0 ( e.g. , linear and quadratic ) can be simultaneously addressed using multiple laser frequencies , allowing for simultaneous laser cooling and qnd energy readout . </S>",
    "<S> each type of coupling offers distinct functionality , and together they represent a new set of tools for observing and controlling quantum effects in optomechanical systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the features in the cavity spectrum responsible for these couplings are reproduced by a straightforward theoretical model , allowing for optimization of future devices . </S>"
