    "when a star loses mass on a time scale faster than the kelvin - helmholtz time ( but slower than the dynamical time ) , as can happen in extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emri ) , the structure of the star will evolve adiabatically so that the entropy as a function of interior mass @xmath0 is approximately conserved .",

    "however , we assume that the change is slow enough so that the stellar orbit remains circular .",
    "if the orbit crosses the black hole s innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) before it is tidally consumed , it will plunge into the hole .",

    "this formula can be obtained by comparing the tidal force from the hole and the gravitational force from the star for a point mass on the roche surface , and also using kepler s laws in the newtonian limits . through simple calculation",

    "however , we can study two extreme cases , namely , completely solid planets and completely liquid ones , in order to see how they react to tidal consumption by a massive hole .",
    "the densities of solid planets like earth will remain unchanged when the planets are tidally stripped . and",
    "these planets tend to have relatively similar densities from the center to the surface .",
    "therefore , the mean densities of such planets do not change , and the stellar orbital periods do not change either .",

    "its pressure and density roughly follows @xmath84 , where @xmath74 is a constant , and the polytropic index @xmath85 in this case @xcite .",
    "as the planet is stripped , it still follows the polytropic model and satisfies the hydrostatic equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "therefore we can do simple calculations to obtain the new total radius @xmath86 of the planet : @xmath87 in other words , the total radius of the planet remains the same all through the stable tidal stripping process .",

    "its effective angular momentum decreases as well .",
    "the primary motivation for this paper is to understand the response of a star or a planet when it is tidally stripped by a massive black hole in a stable manner .",

    "( other capture scenarios are possible , and have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite . )    we constrained the orbit to be circular for simplicity , because of the rapid decay of the stellar orbital eccentricity as angular momentum and energy are carried away by gravitational radiation .",
    "@xcite gave a detailed calculation of this , and showed how the eccentricity changes as the orbit shrinks in the decay of a two - point mass system : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the semi - major axis , @xmath90 is the eccentricity , and @xmath91 is a constant determined by the initial condition @xmath92 when @xmath93 .",

    ". then the initial @xmath96 s are ( from bottom to top ) : 0.9999 ( red ) , 0.999 ( blue ) , 0.99 ( green ) , and 0.9 ( orange ) .",
    ", width=288 ]    what is clear from these results is that for most types of stars , the stellar mean density decreases as mass is tidally stripped , at least during the later phase of the mass - transfer .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the orbit will expand after mass transfer is initiated",
    ". the further implications of this general result will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a star in a circular equatorial orbit outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the hole will not be swallowed by the hole .",
    "the isco of a black hole of mass @xmath97 and spin @xmath98 has radius @xmath99 that satisfies the equation :    @xmath100    @xcite .",
    "the isco resides between @xmath1 ( prograde with maximal spin ) and @xmath101 ( retrograde with maximal spin ) .",
    "the tidal radius @xmath102 for a star with a mass @xmath20 and radius @xmath66 near the hole is @xcite : @xmath103    for a particular black hole , only stars with their tidal radii smaller than the isco of the hole can get very close to the hole before they are tidally disrupted .",
    "for example , we can see from fig . 2 of @xcite that for a @xmath104 black hole",
    ", only dwarf stars or lower main sequence stars can get to the isco before being tidally disrupted .",
    "also when the tidal stripping starts , the roche stellar orbital radius @xmath105 should be larger than the isco of the hole .",
    "we shall show in an upcoming paper that @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the mean stellar density and orbital radius of the star fulfilling the roche condition .",
    "in other words , @xmath109 this radius is just slightly larger than @xmath102 with the same order of magnitude .",
