    "the crustal region is just beneath the envelope as shown in the figure .",
    "neutron star crust is separated into outer and inner crust .",
    "the outer crust begins at @xmath0 .",
    "the thickness of the outer crust is a few hundred meters .",
    "the outer crust is made of nuclei arranged in a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice and embedded in a uniform background of electrons which become relativistic at a density @xmath1 .",
    "neutrons and protons are bound in nuclei in this case .",
    "the equilibrium nucleus at @xmath0 is @xmath2fe .",
    "equilibrium nuclei become more and more neutron rich as density increases .",
    "the neutron chemical potential exceeds the neutron rest mass at a density @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , neutrons drip out of nuclei and it is called the neutron drip point .",
    "this is the end of the outer crust and the beginning of the inner crust .",
    "the inner crust is composed of neutron rich nuclei arranged in a bcc lattice and also in coexistence with dripped neutrons and a uniform background of electrons .",
    "the thickness of the inner crust is @xmath4 1 km . more and more neutrons come out of neutron rich nuclei with increasing density .",
    "finally , nuclei of the inner crust dissolve into a uniform nuclear matter at the crust - core boundary .",
    "schematic structure of a neutron star interior.,width=340 ]    extreme physical condition such as very strong surface magnetic fields @xmath5 g were found to exist in a class of neutron stars called magnetars @xcite .",
    "even stronger interior field could exist in magnetars .",
    "magnetars are classified into two groups - anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "sgrs are found to emit sporadic bursts of soft gamma rays .",
    "it was observed that sgrs occasionally emit stronger gamma rays known as giant flares having luminosities as high as @xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "giant flairs are considered to be the result of evolving magnetic field and its stress on the magnetar crust . in the decaying tail of giant flairs , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were observed over long duration @xcite .",
    "qpos were identified as torsional shear modes of magnetar crust @xcite .",
    "the study of qpos might shed light on the ground state properties of magnetar crust .",
    "recent studies showed that high magnetic fields associated with magnetars would influence the composition and eos of neutron star crusts which , in turn , might have impact on the qpo frequencies . in this paper",
    ", we study and discuss this problem .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way .",
    "we discuss the composition and eos of neutron star crusts with or without magnetic field in section 2 .",
    "torsional shear modes are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we summarise in section 4 .",
    "in a seminal paper , baym , pethick and sutherland ( bps ) studied the equilibrium composition and eos of the ground state matter of the outer crust without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "later this bps model was extended to include the effects of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "high magnetic fields of magnetars might influence the composition and eos through landau quantisation .",
    "recently we have revisited the magnetic bps model .",
    "furthermore , we include the finite size effect in the lattice energy and adopted recent experimental and theoretical mass tables @xcite .",
    "we adopt the wigner - seitz approximation in this calculation .",
    "the equilibrium sequence of nuclei is determined by minimising the gibbs free energy per baryon ( @xmath8 ) with respect to mass number ( @xmath9 ) and atomic number ( @xmath10 ) at a constant pressure ( p ) @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the baryon number density and @xmath13 is the number density of nuclei ; those two are connected by @xmath14 .",
    "the energy of the nucleus ( including rest mass energy of nucleons ) is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the binding energy per nucleon",
    ". we obtain experimental nuclear masses from the atomic mass table of ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "we exploit the theoretical extrapolation for the rest of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the lattice energy of the cell @xmath17 is given below @xcite , @xmath18 the cell and nucleus radii are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the first term in eq.([lat ] ) is the lattice energy for point nuclei and the second term corresponds to the finite size effect @xcite .",
    "now we focus on the impact of strong magnetic fields on the gibbs free energy per baryon . in presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the motion of charged particles perpendicular to the magnetic field is quantised into landau levels .",
    "this is known as landau quantisation @xcite . in this calculation",
    ", we are interested only in landau quantisation of electrons and its influence on ground state properties of neutron star crusts .",
    "the electron energy density ( @xmath21 ) , pressure ( @xmath22 ) and number density ( @xmath23 ) due to landau quantisation of electrons are given below @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnetic field , @xmath26 is the maximum landau quantum number , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the electron chemical potential , and the spin degeneracy @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for other values of landau quantum numbers .",

    "consequently , there is no change in electron number density compared with the zero field situation .",
    "however , electron number density strongly enhanced when the field is @xmath36 g. this is attributed to the fact that electrons populate only the zeroth landau level @xcite .",

    "nuclei of the inner crust are also arranged in a bcc lattice .",
    "the wigner - seitz approximation is used in the calculation of the inner crust in presence of strong magnetic fields .",

    "each cell is charge neutral .",
    "there is no coulomb interaction between cells . in this case , the denser phase in a nucleus is in coexistence with the low density phase of neutron gas .",
    "this has to be dealt with in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "the spherical cell in which protons and neutrons reside , does not define a nucleus .",
    "we exploit the subtraction procedure of bonche , levit and vautherin ( blv ) @xcite to remove the gas part from the nucleus plus gas in the cell . in the blv scheme ,",
    "the density profiles of the gas part as well as nucleus plus gas are derived self - consistently in the tf formalism .",
    "finally , the difference of two solutions in blv scheme determines the nucleus @xcite . here",
    "electrons are landau quantised in strong magnetic fields , but protons in the cell are indirectly affected through the charge neutrality .",
    "our starting point in this calculation of inner crust is the thermodynamical potential ( @xmath42 ) of a nucleus .",

    "[ fig2 ] that electron number density is significantly enhanced compared with the zero field case . however , the situation is different at higher densities .",
    "we do not see any enhancement of electron fraction there .",
    "proton fraction is modified in presence of strong magnetic fields through charge neutrality .",
    "neutrons are affected by magnetic fields through @xmath41-equilibrium .",
    "the outcome of this is fewer neutrons drip out of a nucleus in presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "next we obtain the equilibrium nucleus at each density point by minimising the free energy per particle of the cell @xcite . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the sequence of equilibrium nuclei and their corresponding free energies per particle as a function of mass density with and without magnetic field . furthermore , this calculation is done without subtracting the gas part .",
