    "experimental and theoretical investigations of electron transport through single molecules are in the focus of the rapidly growing field of molecular electronics  @xcite .",
    "electron - electron interaction plays an important role , controlling the position of resonant levels and leading to phenomena such as coulomb blockade and kondo effects .",
    "depending on the ratio between the energy scales associated with an effective charging energy and coupling to the leads , molecular junctions can be classified in three groups . in the case of very small coupling ,",
    "the molecular orbitals are only weakly disturbed , strong charge quantization and coulomb blockade take place and transport is mainly determined by sequential tunneling  @xcite . in the opposite case of large coupling , the electronic molecular orbitals are hybridized with states in the leads , charge quantization is suppressed , transport is mainly coherent and the conductance is of the order of the conductance quantum @xmath0  @xcite . finally , in the intermediate situation , the effective electronic spectrum of a molecule is determined essentially by the hybridization , and the interplay between charge quantization and coherent transport may be important  @xcite .",
    "let us consider as a commonly used benchmark example a gold - benzenedithiol - gold ( au - bdt - au ) molecular junction with the central molecule @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath1 .",
    "the experiments  @xcite show that , while it is difficult or impossible to observe the typical coulomb blockade features in this type of molecular junctions , there are signatures of correlated transport , namely a conductance gap at small voltages and a complex shape of the conductance peaks .",
    "one can conclude that transport in the case of intermediate coupling can be correlated and partially incoherent .    in parallel with the experimental investigations ,",
    "a number of theoretical methods were suggested to describe the structure and electronic properties of molecular junctions . in the case of coherent transport",
    "ab initio dft+ngf methods  @xcite , combining density functional theory ( dft ) and nonequilibrium green function ( ngf ) techniques  @xcite , have become standard  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of dft , which is a powerful tool to deal with ground state properties , may become questionable when applied to transport and nonequilibrium situations , especially when inelastic and interaction effects are essential .",
    "indeed , the use of the solutions of the kohn - sham equation as physical quasiparticle states can not be rigorously established .",
    "besides , the dft+ngf is a mean - field theory and lacks to describe many - body effects in systems with strong electron interactions .",
    "thus , being based on the basis of an atomistic modeling of molecular junctions , the rigorous extension of the dft approach to describe transport phenomena remains a challenge .",
    "on the other hand , model - based approaches are particularly important to understand the physics of correlated transport .",
    "the models are solved usually within two main approaches : the ngf technique in the case of strong coupling to the leads , and the quantum master equation ( qme )  @xcite in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the quantum master equation is usually formulated in the basis of many - body eigenstates of the molecule .",
    "it gives a fairly complete description of sequential tunneling , the main features of coulomb blockade and even can capture kondo physics for temperatures of the order of or larger than the kondo temperature  @xcite .",
    "finally , for some nonperturbative effects covering the whole range of temperatures , e.g. the kondo effect in the crossover regime , more sophisticated treatments are necessary , e.g. numerical renormalization group approaches  @xcite , other numerical methods  @xcite or keldysh field theories  @xcite .",
    "the challenge for molecular transport theory is to combine an ab initio approach , required to take into account a realistic geometry and capable to provide the electronic structure of molecular junctions , with a many - body quantum transport technique , which is necessary to incorporate the correlation effects . in this direction",
    "a number of different ab initio based approaches were suggested  @xcite . it should be noted that many - body calculations usually require sophisticated analytical and numerical methods and can be very time consuming .",
    "hence the methods of transport theory can not usually be applied directly to large realistic systems ; instead a combined approach is preferable , where an effective model takes into account only the states predominantly participating in transport .",
    "progress in this direction was achieved recently in applications to coulomb blockade phenomena  @xcite , correlated transport through atomic wires  @xcite , many - body interference  @xcite and kondo effect  @xcite . besides , coulomb blockade phenomena in benzene and benzenedithiol junctions were also considered on the basis of semiempirical atomistic models  @xcite . however",
    ", a systematic ab initio based many - body theory of molecular transport is still lacking .",
    "our aim is to further develop such a theory .",
    "the main problem to be solved on the way from an atomistic model to transport calculations is that a huge number of microscopic ( single - atom ) degrees of freedom must be reduced to an effective few - electron ( or few many - body state ) interacting model , as a prerequisite of successive many - body transport methods .",
    "the main building blocks of our approach are an effective electron model ( an orthonormal basis of localized molecular orbitals and a many - body hamiltonian in this basis ) extracted from atomistic calculations , and a nonequilibrium quantum transport method , based on nonequilibrium green functions or on the quantum master equation .    in the case of strong or intermediate coupling to the leads the electronic molecular levels should be considered together with the levels in the leads .",
    "a corresponding generic atomistic model is shown in fig.[bdt_316 ] .",
    "a so - called extended molecule ( inside the dashed box ) is placed between equilibrium electrodes .",
    "the extended molecule consists of the central region ( roughly the molecule ) and two leads ( the regions of electrodes near the molecule ) .",
    "the size and boundaries of the central region are actually not fixed and should be determined in a way to include all relevant electronic states , as we will see below .",
    "after having defined the appropriate size of the extended molecule , we proceed as follows :    \\i ) we perform hartree - fock or dft ab initio calculations within the extended molecule and obtain the molecular orbitals , which are orthogonal and can serve as a basis for a many - body hamiltonian .",
    "\\ii ) the central region ( e.g. an organic molecule ) and the metallic leads have quite different physical properties , and the approximations required to describe interactions are also different .",
    "thus , it is convenient to transform the basis of molecular orbitals obtained in ( i ) into a basis of localized molecular orbitals ( lmos ) , which can be spatially separated into a basis for the central region and a basis in the lead ends . besides , the advantage of lmos is that the coulomb interaction in this basis can be simplified to the hubbard form .",
    "this procedure enables us to obtain a many - body hubbard - anderson hamiltonian in the central region with ab initio calculated parameters , including the coupling to the leads .",
    "the rest of the leads can be treated within some mean - field approximation .",
    "\\iii ) using the hubbard - anderson hamiltonian , many - body methods ( nonequilibrium green functions and the master equation in this paper ) can be effectively applied to analyze spectral and transport properties of molecular junctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the ab initio basis of localized molecular orbitals is introduced in sec.[sec_lmo ] . the electron - electron interaction and hubbard approximation",
    "are discussed in sec.[sec_hubbard ] .",
    "the parameters of the effective hubbard - anderson hamiltonian for the subspace of electronic states relevant for transport through the central region are derived in sec.[sec_ham ] . in sec.[sec_ngf ] we use nonequilibrium green functions to analyze the coupling to the electrodes and spectral properties .",
    "the many - body spectrum of the central region is discussed in sec.[sec : mbs ] and the transport results are shown in sec.[sec : transport ] .",
    "we give a short conclusion in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the first stage of our approach includes ab initio calculations of the optimized geometry and the relevant basis of electronic states . for the preliminary geometry optimization and molecular dynamics of whole structures",
    "we apply the dft code siesta  @xcite . for the extended molecule only ( without the full electrodes )",
    "the full - electron quantum chemistry code firefly ( former pc gamess )  @xcite is used .",
    "the final geometry optimization is performed using a hybrid dft method , usually b3lyp .",
    "then , the calculation of the molecular orbitals ( mos ) is performed inside the extended molecule ( including both the central region and leads ) .",
    "our test calculations show that a simple local density approximation ( lda ) gives reasonable results for the considered systems . at this stage",
    "we obtain the mos @xmath3 with associated energies @xmath4 .",
    "mos have the advantage of being normalized and orthogonal . however , the canonical mos of the extended molecule can not serve as a good basis for systems with interactions , because both electron - electron and electron - vibron interactions require physically different approximations in different , metal or molecular , parts of the junction .",
    "it is hence more convenient to use _",
    "localized _ molecular orbitals ( lmos ) .",
    "the interactions between localized orbitals have a simple and transparent form and the appropriate approximations can be found . besides , the number of required , relevant basis states is smaller and better controlled for lmos than for mos .    .",
    "the occupied levels are marked red , the empty levels yellow.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to proceed , we divide all mos into four groups ( fig.[mos ] ) . most relevant for transport are the _ transport _ levels near the fermi energy of the electrodes .",
    "these levels are selected for the localization procedure and include both occupied and valence mos in an appropriate energy range around the fermi energy .",
    "this energy range should be larger than the energy scales of the external bias voltage and temperature .",
    "the other criterion is that the obtained lmos should be localized strongly enough inside the central region and in the leads : only in this case it is possible to separate the system into parts and use different approximations for the central region and leads separately .",
    "alternatively , the partial localization of only relevant mos ( for example only @xmath5-type orbitals ) is possible . in any case , these transport electron states play the main role .",
    "all other _ polarization _ states , which are further away from the fermi energy or do not participate in transport for some other reasons , can still affect the interaction between transport electrons and , in particular , screen the coulomb interaction .",
    "the polarization mos can be localized in the same way as the transport orbitals .",
    "finally , the core orbitals at low energies can be included into the effective ( pseudo)potential and empty orbitals at high energies are neglected .",
    "+   +   +   +         for benzenedithiol , considered in this paper , the transport window was chosen to be about 4 ev , and contains about 60 mos , mainly due to the large density of states in the metal leads .",
    "the parameters of the obtained effective model are rather robust against the exact choice of this number .",
    "the lmos are obtained from the mos by the unitary transformation @xmath6 the indices with bars @xmath7 denote the states without the spin degree of freedom .",
    "we apply the foster - boys localization method  @xcite , which minimizes the spatial extent of the orbitals and maximizes the distance between orbital centers .",
    "thus , we obtain maximally localized orbitals . out of the about 60 orbitals only 5 are localized in the central region . while the initial mos spread across the extended molecule , the lmos are spatially localized in the central region ( fig.[bdt_lmos ] ) or in the leads ( fig.[bdt_lmos_leads ] ) .",
    "due to the unitary transformation ( [ mo2lmo ] ) the lmos are still orthogonal and normalized , but the expression @xmath8 is no longer diagonal .",
    "moreover , the related hamiltonian @xmath9 takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the hamiltonians of the left lead , the central region , and the right lead separately .",
    "the direct coupling between left and right leads can be neglected in most cases , because the lmos of different leads are only very weakly overlapping .",
    "having the lmos at hand we can calculate the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "the electron - electron interactions are described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the spin .",
    "the matrix elements for the scalar coulomb interaction @xmath17 are defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kronecker symbol . for the systems with localized wave functions @xmath20 , where the overlap between two different states is weak , the main matrix elements are those with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we checked that , indeed , the overlap of 3 or 4 different orbitals can be neglected in comparison with the overlap of only 2 orbitals . in these cases",
    "it suffices to replace @xmath23 by the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath24 describing only density - density interactions with and the hubbard parameters defined as @xmath25 as a further advantage of lmos , the local nature of electron correlation is better described in the localized basis .",
    "the interaction @xmath26 is the bare coulomb interaction , if we include all electrons into the localization procedure .",
    "actually we restrict the effective hamiltonian to transport electronic states , on which we performed the hubbard approximation .",
    "the remaining polarization electrons are included only through a screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the screening can be described by the effective interaction potential in rpa ( or gw ) approximation , which is , however , energy dependent . to keep the simplicity of the hubbard approximation",
    ", we use a screened coulomb interaction with @xmath27 .",
    "this approximation gives reasonable values of @xmath28 for the benchmark @xmath5-orbital model of benzene c@xmath29h@xmath29 which we compared with the optimized semi - empirical ppp model  @xcite . in this way",
    "all coefficients are derived , but further semi - empirical corrections could be included for better agreement with experiments .",
    "the next important step is the derivation of the entire effective hamiltonian in the basis of the lmos for the central region .",
    "as we already explained , we divide the extended molecule into the central part ( actually the molecule in our particular case ) and the leads ( fig.[smj_mod_1 ] ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian is the sum of the noninteracting molecular hamiltonian @xmath30 , the electron - electron interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 , the hamiltonians of the ends of the leads @xmath31 , and the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath32 describing the molecule - to - lead coupling : @xmath33 in our case the central hamiltonian @xmath34 is replaced by the hubbard cluster hamiltonian : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the bare energies of the lmos , including the shifts due to an external voltage .",
    "the noninteracting molecular hamiltonian @xmath30 is obtained from the lmo hamiltonian @xmath12 , eq.([h_em ] ) .",
    "the zero - voltage energies @xmath37 are calculated from the hf or dft mo energies @xmath4 , from which the contribution of the hartree terms due to hubbard interactions should be substracted : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath40 denote the populations of the corresponding lmos in the ab initio calculation .",
    "the sum is taken over all occupied molecular orbitals .",
    "the coupling to the leads is described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath41 and the hamiltonians of the left and right leads are @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the index of a state , and @xmath44 is the spin .",
    "note that in our case the states in the leads are not plane waves , but are represented by lmos , calculated simultaneously with the lmos in the active region .",
    "the leads are considered at the mean - field ( dft ) level .",
    "the equilibrium electrodes , which can have different electrochemical potentials , determine the boundary conditions for the leads .",
    "for the 5-level model ( fig.[bdt_lmos ] ) , which represents actually 10 levels with spin , we obtain the following parameters ( for spin up or down , all numbers are in @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 the matrix of the hubbard parameters calculated from expression ( [ lmo_u ] ) reads @xmath47 the diagonal entries in this matrix correspond to the interaction of two electrons in the same lmo state but with different spin .",
    "the off - diagonal terms denote coupling beween two different lmos spin of the electronic state .",
    "of course , these expressions should be transformed into the 10-level basis before performing further calculations .    at finite bias voltage @xmath48 ( defined by the left and right electrical potentials , )",
    "the energies are shifted . in linear approximation",
    "these shifts are described by @xmath49 : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where the parameters @xmath52 characterize the symmetry of the voltage drop across the junction , @xmath53 stands for the symmetric case . note that the energies and other parameters can also be _ ab initio _ calculated at finite voltage , but that is very time - consuming .",
    "the coupling matrix elements @xmath54 in eq.([h_tun ] ) are obtained directly from the localization procedure .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian of an extended molecule takes the form eq.([h_em ] ) , and the off - diagonal terms describe the coupling to the leads .",
    "the number of states in the leads is many times larger than in the central region .",
    "thus , to leading approximation , we can average over the lead level distributions and couplings ( so - called wide - band limit ) . in this approximation",
    "the level - width function @xmath55 is energy independent .",
    "we now return to our 5-level model .",
    "the couplings of the first two states ( localized at the left sulfur atom ) and the last two states ( localized at the right sulfur atom ) are characterized by the level - width functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "all other couplings are small and do not play an essential role .",
    "thus , all parameters of the model hamiltonian eqs.([ahm])-([h_leads ] ) are well defined and we can proceed with transport calculations . in view of the experiments  [ ] , we will perform calculations below room temperature , @xmath60 , implying @xmath61 .    as we discussed in the introduction , transport at finite voltage can be described in the framework of nonequilibrium green function or quantum master equation approaches implying numerical methods . for benzene - based junctions",
    "several methods were used , including coherent dft based , the master equation approach in the sequential tunneling limit  @xcite , sophisticated approximations in the framework of the nonequilibrium green function method  @xcite , and other methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use both ngf and qme methods , trying to attack the problem from both sides .",
    "it should be noted , however , that for our case , @xmath62 , both ngf and a qme with second order rates can only give a qualitative description of the transport problem .",
    "very recently , a qme approach for a single - level junction able to describe the regime @xmath63 has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this method to a multilevel system will be subject of future investigations .",
    "we follow the formulation pioneered by meir , wingreen and jauho  @xcite .",
    "the lesser ( retarded , advanced ) green function matrix @xmath64 of a nonequilibrium molecule can be found from the dyson - keldysh equations in the integral form @xmath65 & { \\hat g}^<(\\epsilon)=    { \\hat g}^r(\\epsilon){\\hat\\sigma}^<(\\epsilon){\\hat g}^a(\\epsilon),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or from the corresponding equations in the differential form @xmath66 @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the total self - energy of the molecule composed of the interaction self - energy @xmath69 and the tunneling ( coupling to the left ( l ) and right ( r ) lead ) self - energies @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the green function of the leads .",

    ", the level - width function is determined by the expression ( [ lwf ] )",

    "accordingly , the full hamiltonian has the form @xmath84 where the central part is the same as before , eq.([h_em ] ) , and the additional terms describe the electrodes and the coupling between the electrodes and the leads .",
    "the solution of eq.([gr_int ] ) for the central part is in this case @xmath85 with the lead self - energies @xmath86 ( see eq.([sigmar_hf ] ) ) and level - width functions defined as @xmath87 the lead green functions for noninteracting leads ( or for leads described by the effective mean - field hamiltonians @xmath88 ) are defined correspondingly by the electrode self - energies @xmath89 the calculation of the electrode self - energies is done by standard methods  @xcite .",
    "the lesser green functions are calculated in the same way .",
    "we assume additionally that the distribution function in the leads is the same as in the corresponding electrodes .",
    "the equations are solved self - consistently within four approximations : initial dft with the mean - field energies eq.([e_lmo ] ) , the restricted hf approximation ( rhf ) with @xmath90 , the unrestricted hf approximation ( [ sigmar_hf ] ) and , finally , the equation of motion method ( eom )  @xcite .    first we analyze the equilibrium ( zero bias ) spectral function of the central region ,",
    "@xmath91 the first thing one can see ( fig.[a ] ) is that the rhf approximation gives a spectral function similar to the ab initio ( dft ) one .",
    "this is not surprising as the ab initio calculation is also rhf and we simply extracted the hartree contribution when calculating the energies @xmath92 in eq.([deltaeps ] ) .",
    "the other important point is that the results obtained in hf and eom approximations are distinctly different and a gap is opened at the fermi surface .",
    "the analysis of the populations @xmath93 of the single - particle states shows that two empty states are located at the left and one at the right side of the molecule ( second and fifth states in fig.[bdt_lmos ] ) .",
    "these two empty states have the same spin ( in the hf approximation the ground state is spin polarized and degenerate , but quantum fluctuations can switch between different spin orientations ) , indicating that the true ground state , with quantum fluctuations taken into account , can be spin singlet or triplet .",
    "we discuss this point in the next section .",

    "we get 1024 many - body states in the fock space .",
    "the lowest 8-particle states consist of a series of alternating singlets and triplets ( see table[tab : levels ] ) .",
    "in particular , the ground state is a singlet , practically degenerate with a triplet ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "it follows , at a distance of roughly @xmath97 a second pair of singlet - triplet quasi degenerate states .",
    "the 9-particle states are all doublets with a relatively regular distance of the order of @xmath98 . finally , it is important to keep in mind that the energies of the lowest four 8-particle levels lie all below the one of the 9-particle ground state .",
    "the 7-particle states have much higher energies .",
    ".the eigenenergies and the associated spins of the lowest 8 and 9 particle levels of an au - bdt - au molecular junction . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the left transition rate is larger than the right one when the transition from an 8 to a 9-particle state is associated to a larger variation of the density in the orbitals 1 or 2 than in the orbitals 4 or 5 .",
    "analogous arguments hold for the reverse situation .",
    "let us now return to the interpretation of the current voltage characteristics with the help of fig.[fig : dynamics ] . by convention , to a positive bias voltage",
    "@xmath99 corresponds a stationary particle current flowing from right to left while the electrical current flows from left to right .",
    "we concentrate first on the negative bias . from an accurate analysis of the definition of the tunnelling rates ( eq.([me2 ] ) ) it is not difficult to prove that the first step in the current is due to the resonant condition between the @xmath100 and @xmath101 states at the left lead .",
    "current flows since the system oscillates between the @xmath100 and @xmath101 states by receiving an electron from the left lead and by releasing it to the right one .",
    "the asymmetry between the transition rates , @xmath102 , ensures than even after the opening of the current channel the occupation of the @xmath103 ( together with the almost degenerate @xmath104 ) is still the largest one . in the right panel of fig.[fig : dynamics ] we schematically represent the tunnelling rates and the associated populations of the most relevant levels for a bias just above ( in absolute value ) the first negative bias conductance peak . starting from this population distribution it is then natural to observe the next visible current step related to the transition @xmath105 .",
    "since this time the left tunnelling rate dominates , the population of the 8-particle states decreases substantially in favor of the 9-particle ones . generally , a more uniform mixing of states with different particle number is associated with a larger fluctuation of the number of electrons in the central system and thus with a larger current .",
    "the dynamics at positive bias is more complex .",
    "in particular the first conductance peak occurs at a bias at which even the ground to ground state transition is not yet open .",
    "this anomalous behaviour is understandable when taking into account the large left - right asymmetry of the rates . as schematically represented in the left panel of fig.[fig : dynamics ] , even before the ( right lead ) resonance between the @xmath100 and the @xmath101 state opens a conventional current channel , the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 get strongly populated .",
    "the fundamental reason is the large probability to tunnel out of the system at the left lead through the transition @xmath108 @xmath109 which is also energetically favorable .",
    "very soon the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 become the new effective ground states for the system ( see fig.[fig : mbs ] ) . in this scheme",
    "it is thus not surprising that i ) the first conductance peak is located at an `` average '' between the @xmath110 resonance and the @xmath111 one ; ii ) the next two conductance peaks at positive bias occur at the @xmath112 and @xmath113 resonant conditions .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a many - body localized molecular orbital approach to transport through molecular junctions with the following protocol :    1 .",
    "geometry optimization using dft and hybrid dft ( usually b3lyp based ) methods . 2 .",
    "molecular vibrons can be calculated after the geometry optimization ( not considered in this paper ) .",
    "molecular orbitals of the extended molecule are obtained .",
    "localized molecular orbitals ( lmos ) are constructed and form the basis for all subsequent calculations .",
    "a hubbard interaction is introduced for the lmos in the central region : only density - density coulomb integrals are taken into account .",

    "using the benchmark example of a benzene - dithiol molecular junction , we performed the full line of calculations in the framework of this approach .",
    "we determined the geometry of the junction , calculated molecular orbitals and transformed them into localized molecular orbitals . upon using an energy range of about 4 ev around the fermi energy of gold ,",
    "we obtained a basis of 5 lmos with energies @xmath114 .",
    "then we calculated the coulomb matrix elements @xmath28 for these orbitals and coupling matrix elements @xmath54 between the central region and the leads .",
    "using the parameters @xmath114 , @xmath28 and @xmath54 , obtained from ab initio calculations , we calculated the spectral function in the framework of the nonequilibrium green function approach ( in the rhf , hf and neom approximations ) . besides",
    ", the model was transformed into the many - body eigenstate basis , and the quantum master equation ( applied in the sequential tunneling limit ) was used to calculate the current .",
    "it is shown that transport through asymmetrically - coupled molecular edge states results in suppressed peaks of the differential conductance at small voltage and unexpectedly large peaks at higher voltages .",
    "the origin of these anomalies could be explained upon analyzing the occupation probabilities of the many - body states as well as their compositions in terms of lmos . in general",
    ", we could qualitatively understand the equilibrium state and main transport properties of the considered molecular junction with strong electron - electron interaction and intermediate coupling to the leads .",
    "nevertheless , the further development of the theory is necessary with respect to both ab initio and quantum transport aspects .",
    "the results presented in this paper are only partially self - consistent because the parameters @xmath114 , @xmath28 and @xmath54 are calculated at zero voltage , but used at all voltages . actually , it is possible to extend the theory to include the recalculation of the parameters at finite voltage and the influence of the nonequilibrium charge in the central region on the leads .",
    "a related issue is the effect of the external field on the lmos energies , which we treat using a simplified linear approximation .",
    "the hubbard interaction plays the main role , but the corrections due to non density - density interactions and polarization of the molecule can be important as well . finally , we expect that the method proposed in ref .   could be of importance to treat the parameter regime @xmath115 typical for molecular junctions with intermediate coupling to the leads .",
