    "recently there has been interest in superfluid fermion systems where there exist superfluid states that retain gapless fermionic excitations  @xcite .",
    "these states embody `` phase separation in momentum space '' : some degrees of freedom pair , forming a superfluid , while others remain unpaired , maintaining the properties of a fermi surface .",
    "they are likely to become experimentally accessible in the near future  @xcite .",
    "the important new result is that such states are stable , but to see this , one must perform a careful analysis of the momentum dependence of the interaction .",
    "appropriate systems ( such as two - band models  @xcite ) have been studied , but these states were missed because the possibility of momentum dependence was ignored .",
    "we also address the questions of instability toward phase separation  @xcite and local currents  @xcite raised in response to the proposal  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider systems of two species that , in the absence of interactions , would have two distinct fermi surfaces .",
    "simple heuristic considerations suggest the possibility that pairing takes place about the fermi surfaces , but that there is no pairing in a region between the surfaces : this led to the term `` breached pair ''  @xcite . a breached pair superfluid state ( bp )",
    "is characterized by the coexistence of a superfluid and a normal component in a translationally invariant and isotropic state .",
    "these components are accommodated in different regions of momentum space with the normal component residing in the `` breaches '' , bounded by gapless fermi surfaces .",
    "a state of this type was also considered by sarma  @xcite .",
    "he considered the case of a superconductor in an external magnetic field , and found that , although there is a self - consistent mean - field solution with gapless modes , it is unfavored energetically to the fully gapped bcs solution .",
    "similar results were considered in the context of color superconductivity  @xcite , again concluding that these states are not stable at fixed chemical potential .    since the fully gapped bcs solution enforces equal numbers of each species , it was incorrectly suggested  @xcite that one might stabilize the gapless phase by enforcing constraints on the particle numbers .",
    "indeed , by enforcing unequal numbers of each species , one forbids the formation of a fully gapped bcs state , but admits `` breached pair '' states in which the excess in one species can be accommodated by the breach . in the qcd context , a similar argument has been made by imposing charge neutrality  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , bedaque , caldas and rupak  @xcite pointed out that a spatially mixed phase may be energetically preferable : this rules out the first possibility  @xcite but may not affect the qcd case due to the long - range gauge interactions .    here",
    "we clarify , broaden , and correct this discussion .",
    "we conclude that :    * for extensive systems , one can not stabilize a state by imposing different global constraints ( such as fixed particle number ) : the composition of the state can be completely determined from an analysis of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the specific examples considered in  @xcite are accordingly unstable . * with the proper momentum structure , however , one may realize breached pair superfluidity in states that are thermodynamically stable for fixed chemical potentials . we exhibit these below",
    ".    our considerations do not apply directly to non - extensive systems .",
    "charge conservation or color neutrality constraints enforced by long - range gauge forces might stabilize bp phases .",
    "( of course , the possibility of a competing mixed phase must still be considered quantitatively . )",
    "in the context of two component fermionic systems as considered in  @xcite , three competing homogeneous phases have been considered : a normal state of free fermions ( n ) , a fully gapped superfluid phase ( bcs ) , and a gapless bp phase .",
    "the bcs phase has complete pairing between the two species , and thus enforces equal densities .",
    "the other phases admit differing densities .    upon solving the self - consistency conditions ( gap equations )",
    ", one commonly finds that over a range of chemical potentials there are three distinct solutions . to determine which is stable in this grand canonical ensemble",
    ", one must minimize the grand thermodynamic potential ( equivalently , maximize the pressure ) of the system .",
    "typically , two of the three solutions are minima on either side of the third bp state which is a local maximum : fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] shows a typical potential .",
    "the gapless states found in  @xcite correspond to local maxima , thus the competing state with larger gap parameter @xmath0 has higher pressure and renders the bp state unstable in this ensemble .    if the stable solution is fully gapped , then it has equal densities . by fixing the particle densities to be unequal",
    ", one may forbid this bcs state .",
    "furthermore , upon comparing the helmholtz free energies @xmath1which must be minimized in this ensemble  one may find that the `` unstable '' bp state is favored over the normal state n.    this apparent contradiction in the stability analysis based on different ensembles can be resolved by considering a mixed phase  @xcite which has an even lower helmholtz free energy @xmath1 . that such a resolution is always possible",
    ", however , may not be apparent ; indeed , it is generally hard to determine the mixed phase explicitly . by using general properties  @xcite of the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath2 , however",
    ", one can argue that such a solution is always possible , as follows . by definition",
    ", @xmath3 minimized over all competing phases .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is a concave function of the chemical potentials @xmath4 .",
    "( we consider here fixed @xmath5 , but concavity in @xmath6 also follows from maximizing entropy . ) furthermore , there is a one - to - one correspondence between tangents @xmath2 and states of fixed particle number : @xmath7 when @xmath2 is not differentiable , there is a cone of possible tangent hyperplanes which contact @xmath2 and which bound @xmath2 from above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tangents ] ) .",
    "this cone of tangents describes various possible mixed phases composed of the pure phases ( where @xmath2 is differentiable ) that intersect at the singularity . to find the state that minimizes @xmath1 for some fixed constraint @xmath8 one simply forms the hyperplane with gradient @xmath9 and drops this until it contacts the surface @xmath2 .",
    "the first point of contact will define either a pure or mixed state which satisfies the appropriate constraints .",
    "since this state also lies on @xmath2 , it minimizes @xmath2 for the fixed chemical potentials defined by the contact point .",
    "no matter what constraints we apply , there is always a stable state in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this argument is valid only for extensive thermodynamic systems .",
    "long - range interactions can render the energy of some pure phases non - extensive ( due , for example , to the rapidly diverging coulomb energy per unit volume @xmath10 as @xmath11 ) .",
    "in such cases , a mixed phase would contain bubbles of limited size .",
    "the surface energy of these phase boundaries becomes a volume effect and must therefore be taken into account , even in the thermodynamic limit ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this complicates the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this rest of this letter",
    ", we shall consider only finite - range interactions .",
    "we now demonstrate , by example , how to realize pure bp superfluid states in extensive systems .",
    "we shall consider the mean - field analysis of two models , each with two species of fermions @xmath14 and @xmath15 of differing masses @xmath16 : @xmath17 the models have different interactions @xmath18 : ( [ eq : vr ] ) and  ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "we shall consider these systems in the grand canonical ensemble at zero temperature by minimizing the thermodynamic potential density @xmath19 .",
    "it will be natural , however , to use the parameters @xmath20 in place of the chemical potentials @xmath21 .",
