    "the study and detection of gravitational waves is a very active area of current research .",
    "gravitational radiation is a direct test of dynamical gravity and elucidating its properties experimentally has the potential to confirm ( or even change ) our current gravitational theory .",
    "furthermore , the detection of a gravitational wave background would open a new observational window onto a time in the early universe much earlier than that of recombination , beyond which the universe is opaque to electromagnetic waves .",
    "the potential rewards to cosmology that would result from such a detection are countless . with the new interferometric gravitational wave telescopes ( ligo , geo and tama ) now operating and plans for a future space - based telescope ( lisa )",
    "it will become possible to detect waveforms from various astrophysical sources , including topological defects .",
    "this has the potential to determine , or at worst constrain , the types of high energy particle theories that describe our world .",
    "topological defects are a prediction of most particle physics models that involve a symmetry breaking phase transition @xcite as well as some brane - world scenarios @xcite and are therefore quite generic .",
    "cosmic strings , in particular , have drawn considerable attention because they do not cause cosmological disasters and are good candidates for a variety of interesting cosmological phenomena such as gamma ray bursts @xcite , gravitational wave bursts @xcite and ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "analytic studies @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show that cosmic string networks evolve toward an attractor solution known as the `` scaling regime '' . in this regime",
    "the energy density of the string network is a small constant fraction of the radiation or matter density and the statistical properties of the system such as the correlation lengths of long strings and average sizes of loops scale with the cosmic time @xmath0 .",
    "this solution is possible because of intercommutations that produce cosmic string loops which in turn decay by radiating gravitationally",
    ".    simulations also have found that the perturbations on long strings and most loops have the smallest possible size , the simulation resolution , which does not scale .",
    "this small - scale structure arises from a build - up of the sharp edges ( kinks ) @xcite produced at string intersection events and the initial brownian character of the network .",
    "it is not clear , however , how very small loops can be formed at late times .",
    "the mechanism that has so far been suggested is that they form at regions of the string known as cusps @xcite , although in this case we expect the loops formed to have relativistic speeds .",
    "this is discussed at some length below .",
    "it may also be that the small loops form from the collapse of horizon - sized loops .",
    "the size of this small - scale structure is also thought to scale with the cosmic time @xmath0 . the value typically quoted in the literature , first proposed in @xcite , is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a number of order 100 , @xmath3 is newton s constant and @xmath4 is the mass per unit length of the string , but the actual value may be many orders of magnitude smaller @xcite",
    ".    one of the key signatures of cosmic strings is the production of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the network of long strings and loops is expected to produce a gravitational wave background as well as bursts coming from cusps and kinks .",
    "these bursts stand out of the gravitational wave background and may be detectable with current sensitivities @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the shape and gravitational waveforms of cusps with small - scale structure . in the next section we review the motion of strings and construct solutions where helical small - scale structure is introduced using products of rotations . in section iii",
    "we investigate various small - scale structure regimes and show that the presence of small - scale structure at cusps under most circumstances leads to the production of loops at the size of the smallest scales .",
    "we further illustrate the various regimes , and shapes of the resulting cusps , using the solutions found in section ii . in section",
    "iv we describe the numerical algorithm employed to compute gravitational waveforms and in section v we show the waveforms for cusps on loops with and without small - scale structure .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "when the typical length scale of a cosmic string is much larger than its thickness , and long - range interactions between different string segments can be neglected , the string can be accurately modeled by a one - dimensional object .",
    "such an object sweeps out a two - dimensional surface in space - time referred to as the string world - sheet . here",
    "we will consider the motion of strings in flat space , which is a good approximation to motion in a cosmological setting provided we are studying a loop or a segment on a long string which is much smaller than the horizon .    to study the motion of strings we use the nambu - goto action @xcite which is proportional to the area of the string world - sheet .",

    "these vectors therefore live on a unit sphere @xcite and will be referred to as the right- and left - moving halves of the string .",
    "expressions for the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are most easily written as sums of fourier harmonics .",
    "unfortunately the unit magnitude constraint eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) generally gives a non - linear set of equations involving the vector coefficients of the fourier expansion and parametrising strings beyond the first few harmonics proves to be analytically intractable .",
    "there exists a method to generate strings involving products of rotation matrices that greatly simplifies this task @xcite . in this method the @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are generated by starting with a unit vector and operating on it with a series of rotation matrices that through trigonometric identities produce harmonics .",
    "the advantage of using this method to generate loops is that the unit magnitude constraint on the right- and left - movers is satisfied trivially .    as an example of this method we can define the following loop @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath27-dimensional rotation matrix that rotates the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane by an angle @xmath30 ; the direction of the rotation",
    "is chosen such that the positive end of the @xmath28th axis is rotated toward the positive end of the @xmath29th axis . on the unit sphere , @xmath31 as given by eq .",

    "( [ wigglyunit ] ) consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is a vector of magnitude @xmath40 in the direction of @xmath36 and it corresponds to the straight part of @xmath24 .",
    "the second part is a circle of radius @xmath41 on the @xmath35-@xmath32 plane , perpendicular therefore to @xmath36 , that winds around this plane @xmath42 times .",
    "this represents the perturbed part of @xmath24 . acting on this new unit vector @xmath43 with the rotation @xmath44 produces a curve in the unit sphere with helical perturbations of radius @xmath41 .",
    "an analogous operation can be carried out on @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : unit1 ] illustrates the effect of this procedure . equation ( [ simpleloop ] ) gives @xmath31 and @xmath24 that trace out great circles on the unit sphere .",

    "cusps are regions on long strings or loops that achieve phenomenal lorentz boosts .",
    "these boosts , combined with the potentially large mass per unit length of cosmic strings , may lead to the production of a detectable gravitational wave signal @xcite .",
    "cusps arise when the right- and left - moving parts of the string cross on the unit sphere . at the crossing they point in the same direction , namely , @xmath45 in this case @xmath46=0 , \\label{cusp2}\\ ] ] and @xmath47={{\\bf a}'}={{\\bf b}'}. \\label{cusp3}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the tip of the cusp therefore moves at the speed of light and a small region of string around the cusp has an enormous lorentz boost .",
    "cusps are generic in the sense that the @xmath31 and @xmath24 are confined to live on the unit sphere and for general string and loop configurations we typically expect them to cross .",
    "the effects on cusps of the presence of small - scale structure on just one of the string halves ( ` chiral ' structure ) was investigated briefly in @xcite .",
    "there it was argued that the shape of the cusp depends on the contribution of the small perturbations to the effective mass per unit length of the string .",
    "here we will review and expand that discussion to the more general case of small - scale structure on both halves of the string .",
    "although the detailed properties of small - scale structure in cosmic string networks are still not understood it is useful to study the range of possibilities .",
    "below we show that under most circumstances the presence of small - scale structure at a cusp leads to the formation of loops at the size of the smallest scales .    for simplicity",
    "we consider a loop of size @xmath50 with small - scale structure of wavelength @xmath51 and amplitude to wavelength ratio @xmath52 .",
    "for now we take the small - scale structure to be the same in both directions .",
    "the string has an effective thickness due to the small - scale structure , @xmath53    when a long string or loop has a cusp the effective thickness of the string may result in overlap .",
    "calculations for the overlap of the fields making up the string core have been performed in @xcite and @xcite . in the case of core",
    "overlap the fields in a small section of the string near the tip of the cusp unwind and produce energy in the form of particles , the bosons that make up the string .",
    "fortunately we can borrow these results , expecting , however , for overlap to result in the formation of cosmic string loops rather than particles .",
    "the latter work @xcite took account of the lorentz contraction of the core and is the correct calculation for generic string core overlap .",
    "the former work @xcite did not account for the contraction of the string core but , as we will see , the main result may be useful in the case of back - reaction - dominated cusps .    if the small - scale structure is small enough to have little effect on the average motion of the string , then the analysis of @xcite applies , and we expect an overlapping region near the cusp of length @xmath54 which will typically fragment into about @xmath55 relativistic loops of the small - scale size @xmath51 . here",
    "the effect of the small - scale structure has been to replace the core thickness of the string with the effective thickness @xmath56 , which is usually much larger .",
    "the overlap begins when the lorentz gamma factor of the cusp reaches the value @xmath57 when the small - scale structure is not symmetrically distributed between the right- and left - movers at the cusp , the overlap expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ loverlap ] ) and ( [ gammaoverlap ] ) , will be dominated by the larger of the two halves .",
    "on the other hand , if the small - scale structure is large enough , there will be important corrections to the nambu - goto motion .",
    "the effect of small - scale structure increases as the string begins to move rapidly near a cusp , with the effective mass per unit length becoming @xmath58 therefore when the gamma factor reaches the value @xmath59 the contribution to the effective mass per unit length of the string becomes significant and the effective motion of the string deviates from regular nambu - goto motion .",
    "averaging the motion of the string over scales of the size of the small - scale structure and smaller results in an increase of the effective mass density and a decrease of the tension of the string @xcite .",
    "whether back - reaction prevents the formation of the relativistic cusp depends on which one of the two gamma factors , eq .",
    "( [ gammabackreact ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ gammaoverlap ] ) , is the smallest . if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 , and overlap begins before back - reaction is important .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath62 , then back - reaction changes the form of the cusp .",
    "the simplest situation of the latter sort occurs when both string halves contribute equally to the effective mass per unit length .",
    "then the effective motion of the string is given by @xcite @xmath63\\ ] ] with @xmath64 .",
    "the two halves therefore live on a sphere of radius @xmath65 .",
    "sharp cusps form as before , because at crossings on the sphere the effective @xmath66 , but the tips of cusps move at a speed @xmath67 rather than at the speed of light . because the cusps are sharp we expect the small - scale structure to overlap .",
    "if the perturbations are small then the cusp is relativistic and we expect an overlapping region around the cusp of a size given by eq .",
    "( [ loverlap ] ) and the production of relativistic loops . however , if the small - scale structure is sufficiently large the region of overlap will be larger due to the negligible lorentz contraction of the core and we can use the result in @xcite . in this case",
    "we expect an overlapping region of size @xmath68 around the cusp , which will fragment into about @xmath69 loops of the small - scale size @xmath51 .",
    "since the loops produced in this case are non - relativistic , this mechanism may be responsible for the large number of small loops seen in simulations .    at first glance",
    "the small - scale structure in numerical simulations would appear too small to slow down cusps sufficiently to produce non - relativistic loops .",
    "however , the wavelength of the perturbations on long strings is a very small fraction of the length of the long strings and the fact that it can be observed at all in simulations means the amplitude to wavelength ratios can not be negligibly small .",
    "if the small - scale structure is not symmetrically distributed between the right- and left - movers at the cusp , for example because of statistical fluctuations , the radii of the spheres on which the effective right- and left - moving halves live will be different .",
    "they will therefore miss each other and make @xmath70 finite , with @xmath71 at the cusp . here",
    ", the sub - indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 distinguish between right- and left - movers . the limiting situation of ` chiral ' small - scale structure ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) was investigated in @xcite and is similar to that of a superconducting string with a chiral neutral current @xcite .    since @xmath70 is finite the cusp will be rounded .",
    "if the radius of curvature of the cusp is comparable to the effective thickness of the string then we are in the same situation as before : a section of string will overlap near the cusp .",
    "the amount of overlap will be given by either one of eqs .",
    "( [ loverlap ] ) or ( [ loverlap2 ] ) depending on the size of the small - scale structure .",
    "if the radius of curvature of the cusp is much larger than the thickness then there will be no overlap .",
    "this case is analogous to that of superconducting strings with a chiral neutral current and we expect self - intersections to occur at the cusp about half of the time @xcite .",
    "these self - intersections result in the production of a loop of size @xmath75 which will fragment into about @xmath76 loops of the small - scale size @xmath51 .    to summarise",
    ", we have seen that in most cases overlap of the small - scale structure at a cusp leads to the formation of loops at the smallest scales .",
    "the only exception occurs when the small - scale structure is a ) sufficiently large that the averaged motion of the string deviates significantly from nambu - goto motion , and b ) sufficiently asymmetric that the radius of curvature of the cusp is larger than the effective thickness of the string . even in this case , however , we expect intersections to produce small loops about half the time .    figure [ fig : loop1close ] illustrates the various possibilities for the shape of cusps with small - scale structure described above . without small - scale structure , we have a sharp cusp which would evaporate at the tip by core overlap . with symmetrical small excitations ,",
    "the cusp is still sharp and will chop off a loop by the overlap of the wiggles . with asymmetrical small - scale structure",

    "these figures show that the overall shape of the waveform of the cusp is not greatly affected by the presence of small - scale structure even when the amplitude of the small - scale structure @xmath52 is not particularly small .",

    "in addition to the smoothing of the large cusp the waveforms also show significant sub - structure . it is a result of the small helical perturbations and is present in both the the @xmath95-polarised and @xmath96-polarised waveforms .",

    "these smaller cusps form as a result of the crossings on the unit sphere that occur around the time the large cusp forms ( as in figure [ fig : unit1 ] ) . in terms of gravitational wave detection",
    "it is possible that the small scale structure gives the dominant contribution to the waveform in some range of frequencies .",
    "this possibility depends on the value of @xmath138 and the details of cosmic string network evolution and deserves further investigation .",
    "the presence of small - scale structure at cusps leads to a multitude of interesting behaviours mostly involving self - intersections of the loop or long string that produces the cusp .",
    "the specific processes and outcomes depend on the detailed properties of the small - scale structure .",
    "indeed , one of the scenarios presented here supports the ideas of albrecht @xcite who first suggested that the small loops seen in simulations are produced at cusps .    at first glance",
    "it would appear that cusps are only able to produce ultra - relativistic loops , which would rule out this mechanism since such loops are not seen in simulations .",
    "however , in the regime where the small - scale structure has enough amplitude to significantly affect the motion of the string , the cusp and the loops it produces through overlap will no longer be relativistic .    as an illustration",
    "we take the canonical value for the size of the small - scale structure , which for gut strings is @xmath139 , and a significant amplitude to wave - length ratio , @xmath140 .",
    "then we expect a horizon - sized cusp , of size @xmath141 , to produce a few hundred non - relativistic loops @xmath142    the primary effect of small - scale structure is to smooth out the sharp waveform emitted by the large cusp in the direction of its motion . that waveform is smoothed anyway if one is located away from the exact direction of motion ; observers outside a cone whose angle is proportional to the small - scale structure amplitude will see little change .",
    "however , since superimposed on the large cusp there is a multitude of smaller ones , it may be that the small - scale structure turns out to give the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave signal in the range of frequencies onto which we happen to have our observational window .",
    "this depends on the typical size of loops and the spectrum of perturbations that ends up on loops .",
    "this possibility deserves further investigation .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties that remain regarding string network evolution make it difficult to say anything definite in this regard .",
    "for instance , if it turns out to be correct that most loops are produced at the smallest possible scales then we do not expect them to have any significant structure .",
