    "quantum turbulence in counterflow of he ii has left a mystery : the transition between two different kinds of superfluid turbulence , namely , the t1-t2 transition @xcite .",
    "recent developments in visualization techniques have enabled us to study this mystery . however",
    ", our theoretical understanding has not yet been developed enough for two chief reasons : 1 .",
    "the difficulty in taking proper account of the inhomogeneity of the system and the geometry of the channel in the formulation and 2 . the need to solve the coupled dynamics of the two fluids to understand the phenomena fully . in this paper , in order to address the first reason we perform a numerical analysis of the vortex dynamics by prescribing realistic nonuniform profiles to the flow of the normal fluid .",
    "the present work reveals characteristic inhomogeneous structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle that has not been reported in preceding works with a uniform flow profile @xcite @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we do not address directly the t1-t2 transition .",
    "if we can address the coupled dynamics of the two fluids , we will be able to reveal the t1-t2 transition , and we are going to report on this work in the near future .",
    "this study is motivated by the recent observation by marakov _",
    "_ @xcite of the flow profiles of the normal fluid in thermal counterflow in a square channel .",
    "they have observed the flow profiles of the normal fluid by following the motion of seeded metastable @xmath2 molecules by a laser - induced - fluoresence technique @xcite .",
    "then in a thermal counterflow they prepare thin @xmath2 molecular tracer lines perpendicular to the flow created by femtosecond - laser field ionization . above 1",
    "k the molecules interact strongly with the normal fluid and trace the motion .",
    "thus how the tracer lines move reveals the flow profile of the normal fluid .",
    "first , they presented evidence that the flow of the normal fluid is indeed turbulent at relatively large velocities @xcite . in their recent studies",
    "they observe the novel transition of the flow profile of the normal fluid @xcite . at relatively small velocities ,",
    "the flow of the normal fluid remains laminar , whereas the superfluid is already turbulent . for heat current @xmath3 , where the value of @xmath4 obtained from the experiment is @xmath5@xmath6 , an initially straight tracer line deforms to a nearly parabolic shape , indicating a laminar poiseuille velocity profile . for @xmath7 , where the value of @xmath8 obtained from the experiment is @xmath9 ,",
    "the outer part of the tracer line becomes flattened , which is called the tail - flattened velocity profile .",
    "such a laminar profile has never been reported in classical fluid dynamics , and it must be characteristic of he ii , namely , a result of the interaction between the normal fluid and the superfluid . in this work we study a numerical simulation of the vortex dynamics under these laminar profiles of the normal fluid .",
    "liquid @xmath0he shows superfluidity below a @xmath10 point of @xmath11 . in a two - fluid model",
    "one considers superfluid @xmath0he as an intimate mixture of normal fluid and superfluid components : the normal fluid has a viscosity , whereas the superfluid is inviscid .",
    "the velocities of the normal fluid and the superfluid component are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and the densities are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the total density @xmath16 is almost independent of temperature .",
    "the ratio of the two fluids depends on temperature , and @xmath17 increases as temperature decreases .",
    "the velocity fields obey different two equations of motion @xcite , and they are basically decoupled .",
    "the idea of quantized circulation in superfluid helium was suggested by onsager @xcite and has been observed experimentally by vinen @xcite . in a superfluid",
    "any rotational motion is sustained only by quantized vortices , which have the quantum circulation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is planck s constant and @xmath20 is the mass of a @xmath21 atom .",
    "the elementary excitations forming the normal fluid are strongly scattered by these quantized vortices .",
    "thus , if there is a relative velocity between the normal fluid and the quantized vortices , a frictional force works between them , being called a mutual friction force . in the superfluid turbulent state the mutual friction term is added to the equations of motion of the two fluids , so that the two fluids become coupled .",
    "thermal counterflow in he ii , which is internal convection of the two fluids , has been studied well as a prototype of quantum turbulence .",
    "one end of the channel is connected with a he ii bath and the other end is closed . upon heating the closed end , the normal",
    "fluid flows to the cooler side to transfer heat .",
    "the superfluid flows oppositely to the warmer end to satisfy mass conservation : @xmath22 where the integral is performed over the cross section of the channel .",
    "thus a relative velocity @xmath23 occurs between the two fluids , where the overline denotes the spatial average over the channel cross section .",
    "when the counterflow velocity exceeds a critical value , a self - sustaining tangle of quantized vortices appears to form superfluid turbulence .",
    "the measurements @xcite show that the vortex line density @xmath24 follows the relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a parameter depending on temperature and @xmath27 is a small parameter .",
    "the scheme for understanding quantum turbulence from the vortex dynamics was addressed by vinen . by assuming homogeneous turbulence he estimated the vortex growth by using a dimensional analysis and modeled the decay process phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "he showed that the dynamics of the vortex tangle is described by vinen s equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are temperature - dependent parameters .",
    "if the vortex tangle is in a steady state , @xmath31 , resulting in eq .",
    "( [ vinen ] ) .",
    "schwarz has investigated counterflow quantum turbulence using the vortex filament model @xcite .",
    "the observable quantities obtained in his calculation agree with the experimental results for the steady state of vortex tangles .",
    "however , his simulation could sustain the steady vortex tangle only through some artificial procedure .",
    "et al . _ argued that this comes from the localized induction approximation ( lia ) in which the interaction between vortices is neglected @xcite . by performing the full biot - savart calculation they removed the difficulty and",
    "successfully obtained the steady state consistent with the experimental results .",
    "we note that in these numerical works the system was assumed to be uniform and the physics coming from the inhomogeneity was missed ; i.e. , the effects of the channel walls and the resulting flow profile were missed .",
    "counterflow quantum turbulence is known to depend on the aspect ratio of the cross section of the channel @xcite . in low - aspect - ratio channels ,",
    "the system has two turbulent states .",
    "an increase in the counterflow velocity is observed to change the laminar state to the first turbulent state t1 , and next to the second turbulent state t2 .",
    "melotte and barenghi @xcite suggested that the transition from t1 to t2 is caused by the transition of the normal fluid from laminar to turbulent .",
    "they addressed the issue of the stability of the normal fluid with the relation to the t1-t2 transition .",
    "in high - aspect - ratio channels , the counterflow exhibits only a single turbulent state t3 , but there has been little information about what t3 is .",
    "the recent visualization experiments have made important breakthroughs for these issues . by using micron - sized solid hydrogen tracers the maryland group @xcite succeeded in visualizing quantized vortices in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "then they applied the technique to thermal counterflow to confirm directly the behavior of the two - fluid model @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite found that the normal fluid in a thermal counterflow has two characteristic laminar flows , as described in the second paragraph of this introduction .",

    "we mention previous numerical studies of thermal counterflow in he ii with a nonuniform profile .",
    "samuels @xcite studied the dynamics of quantized vortices in laminar circular pipe flow with normal fluid poiseuille flow and superfluid flat flow in the same direction .",

    "the simulation generated quantum turbulence under laminar poiseuille flow and turbulent flow of the normal fluid . by examining results",

    "a better understanding of t1 and t2 states would be obtained by studying the flow in a low - aspect - ratio channel where all boundaries are solid except for the flow direction .",

    "it is necessary to address the coupled dynamics of the two fluids to understand the t1-t2 transition . in a typical model of the coupled dynamics",

    "the aspect ratio of the channel plays an important role in the density and the profile of the vortex tangle .",

    "the inhomogeneity is significantly reduced in comparison to the case of hagen - poiseuille flow . in the center of the channel",
    "the vortex line density becomes slightly lower , and the vortex tangle becomes slightly anisotropic .",

    "<S> we perform a numerical analysis of counterflow quantum turbulence of superfluid @xmath0he with nonuniform flows by using the vortex filament model . in recent visualization experiments nonuniform laminar flows of the normal fluid , namely , hagen - poiseuille flow and tail - flattened flow , have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> tail - flattened flow is a novel laminar flow in which the outer part of the hagen - poiseuille flow becomes flat . in our simulation , the velocity field of the normal fluid </S>",
    "<S> is prescribed to be two nonuniform profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this work addresses a square channel to obtain important physics not revealed in the preceding numerical works . in the studies of the two profiles we analyze the statistics of the physical quantities . under hagen - poiseuille flow </S>",
    "<S> , inhomogeneous quantum turbulence appears as a statistically steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex tangle shows a characteristic space - time oscillation . under tail - flattened flow , </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the quantum turbulence depends strongly on that flatness . </S>",
    "<S> vortex line density increases significantly as the profile becomes flatter , being saturated above a certain flatness . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneity is significantly reduced in comparison to the case of hagen - poiseuille flow . </S>",
    "<S> investigating the behavior of quantized vortices reveals that tail - flattened flow is an intermediate state between hagen - poiseuille flow and uniform flow . in both profiles we obtain a characteristic inhomogeneity in the physical quantities , which suggests that a boundary layer of superfluid appears near a solid boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex tangle produces a velocity field opposite to the applied superfluid flow , and , consequently , the superfluid flow becomes smaller than the applied one . </S>"
