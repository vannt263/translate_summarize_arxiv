    "in its beginnings , string theory was expected to be a possible model for strong interactions .",
    "but it was eclipsed by the greatest qcd outcomes , making it to be forgotten as fundamental theory for such interactions .",
    "nowadays , with the development of the so - called gravity / gauge duality , string theory recovers its original motivation becoming a tool to explore the strong interactions at their non - perturbative region even at extreme scenarios with finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "these scenarios are observed at nuclei accelerators and stars center .",
    "duality itself suggests that gravitational dual of qcd should exist .",
    "the real problem is how to find it .    in this direction ,",
    "the most successful approximation to gravity / gauge duality is the ads / cft correspondence by j. maldacena @xcite , which has been used as a tool to describe non - perturbative hadronic phenomena , specially the quark gluon plasma observed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "properties such as the entropy density , bulk viscosity , jet quenching , photon / dilepton emission rate were well described holographically in the zero chemical limit by top / down approaches as the dp / dq system @xcite or the sakai sugimoto model @xcite",
    ". also the bottom / up realizations as the improved holographic qcd model @xcite have described the qgp system .",
    "recently , @xcite have discused the shear viscosity and photon emission in the qgp in the latter model . in the ads",
    "/ qcd realm , some approximations have been made in the references @xcite where they calculated the spectral density for photons in a specific gravitational setup using the soft wall model .",
    "also @xcite has calculations for the hard wall and the soft wall model for finite chemical potential modeled by the probe d - brane method , in which the dbi action is minimized in order to obtain the embedding profile generated by a u@xmath0 static field .",
    "a good review of the holographic approximation to the qgp phenomenology is @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we discuss the photon emission rate and the conductivity from the quantum field theory side . in section 2 , we set the general background for both hard wall and soft wall models . in section 4",
    "it is discussed how we calculate the trace of the spectral function analytically for each ads / qcd model . in section 5 ,",
    "we consider the numerical results obtained for the photon emission rate and the conductivity .",
    "finally in section 6 we enunciate the conclusions for our work .",
    "it is well known that any thermal medium composed of charged particles will radiate photons .",
    "this photon spectrum can be used as a probe to study the characteristics of such thermal medium , since it depends on its specific properties .    in the case of",
    "the qgp produced in heavy ion collisions , the thermal medium is optically transparent due to the small spatial extension and the smallness of electromagnetic coupling .",
    "therefore , any emitted photon escapes from the plasma ball without any further interaction with the medium . in such a situation",
    "the spectrum can be considered as _ almost planckian _ , but it is still useful to obtain information about the plasma in the emission point .    at this point",
    "a remark must be done : depending on the momentum @xmath1 of the emitted photons the dynamics can be split in specific regimes defined by three characteristic length scales , the hard , soft and ultra - soft scales @xcite .",
    "the hard scale is defined when the limit @xmath2 is reached .",
    "contributions of excitations in this scale dominate the bulk thermodynamic properties such as total momentum density and total energy of the plasma , likewise conserved charge susceptibilities .",
    "these excitations also control the transport properties in the colored medium .",
    "the second scale , soft scale , is reached when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gauge theory coupling . in this scenario",
    "the landau damping and also the debye screening , due principally to the coherent interaction of the particles in the thermal colored medium , become important .",
    "these effects are treated with the hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the third scale is the ultrasoft or non - perturbative : @xmath5 . in this scale , low frequency and long wave - length dynamics gives the hydrodynamical regime .",
    "photons produced in this regime carry information about properties such as the electrical conductivity .",
    "soft and hard photons produced in more energetic scenarios tends to be suppressed due to the landau pomeranchuk midgal effect .",
    "photon production in a colored medium was discussed in detail both from strong and weak coupling point of view in reference @xcite .",
    "let us consider a qgp defined by a colored quantum system in equilibrium that can be described by a thermal field theory in the strongly coupling limit .",
    "it will be assumed that the electromagnetic interaction between matter and photons is given by the minimal coupling of a photon field with the electromagnetic current , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the electromagnetic coupling .    at leading order ,",
    "the photo - production is given by the expression @xcite @xmath8 where we have defined the photon 4-momentum as @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the minkowski metric and @xmath11 is the wightman function defined for electromagnetic currents as ,    @xmath12    notice that the expectation value in ( [ wightman ] ) is taken in the thermal equilibrium state and @xmath13 . in the thermal equilibrium limit the wightman correlator can be written in terms of the spectral density ,    @xmath14    with @xmath15 the bose - einstein distribution and @xmath16 the thermal retarded green function . at non zero temperature , lorentz invariance is explicitly broken leaving us a residual rotational symmetry that allows , together with the gauge invariance , to split the thermal green function into longitudinal and transversal parts .    since the idea is to model real photon production ( implying @xmath17 ) , it is possible to ignore the longitudinal part and focus on the transversal one only .",
    "then , the trace of the spectral function ( [ spectral2 ] ) is written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the transversal part of the spectral density . keeping in mind all these definitions and results ,",
    "the photon emission rate is given by    @xmath20    the electrical ac and dc conductivities of the medium are also determined by the trace of the spectral function . from the kubo formula the ac @xmath21 conductivity can be read from the spatial components of @xmath22 as    @xmath23    from the spectral density in the limit of @xmath24 we can read the dc conductivity as    @xmath25    then the problem of calculating the photon emission rate and the conductivity translates into the calculation of the trace of the spectral function holographically .",
    "this procedure will be realized in the next sections .",
    "geometric background we will focus on the calculation of the 2-point function using two of the ads / qcd models : the hard wall @xcite and the soft wall @xcite models .",
    "these two approximations can be summarized into a single expression just by considering the behavior of a statical dilaton @xmath26 field .    in both ads / qcd models",
    "the background is considered dual to the colored medium properties , composed by massless quarks .",
    "since we are considering the finite chemical potential case , it is possible to introduce a charge in the ads background through an einstein  hilbert ",
    "maxwell action .",
    "holographically , we will say that this charge is dual to the generator of the @xmath27 baryonic symmetry .",
    "following these ideas the background action can be written as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , the cosmological constant is @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the ads radius , @xmath32 is the newton constant in five dimensions , and the five dimensional gauge coupling is defined as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the number of colors and flavors respectively . adding temperature to a given system holographically means the presence of a black hole , so it is possible to conclude that the minimal coupled hilbert ",
    "maxwell action ( [ bg_action ] ) leads to a the reissner ",
    "nordstrom ads black hole solution .",
    "in other words , this rn ads bh solution can be considered as the gravitational dual for a strongly coupled plasma under finite chemical potential and finite temperature conditions @xcite . following these ideas ,",

    "if a static solution is chosen , @xmath39 , the @xmath40 factor can be written as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the charge of the black hole and @xmath43 is the event horizon .",
    "the temperature is defined using the hawking  page relation @xcite    @xmath44    in pure ads , i.e. without dilaton , the 1-fom potential is given by @xmath45 . in ads",
    "/ qcd models the same form can not be granted due to the presence of the cutoff . in that case",
    "it is possible to approximate the ads / qcd solution to the pure ads one in the limit @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "holographically , the chemical potential @xmath47 related to the gauge theory in the boundary is defined in the limit @xmath46 where the 1-form static potential is @xmath48 .",
    "holographic photons the qgp will be modeled using a 5-dimensional @xmath27 field @xmath49 coupled to the static dilaton in the ads / qcd standard form @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the coupling constant for photons in the qgp , that in general depends on temperature @xcite and @xmath52 . from the photon action it is possible to obtain the equations of motion for the vector field @xmath49 . to do this ,",
    "the photons will be supposed to be moving in the @xmath53 euclidean direction , then the photon 4momentum can be fixed to be @xmath54 .",

    "the results for hard wall and soft wall models are plotted in the figures [ fig : figone ] and [ fig : figtwo ] .",
    "the hard wall model is a holographic bag in the sense that confinement is placed by a hard cutoff fixed by the temperature of the colored medium .",

    "the trace of spectral density on both models behaves monotonically with @xmath102 for the explored values of @xmath101 .",
    "the soft wall model is more sensitive to increasing of @xmath101 than the hard wall .",

    "the results for @xmath105 are also in agreement with those obtained in @xcite , where the authors construct a different background in order to simulate the results for the d3/d7 system in the massless quark region and try to study how the trace of the spectral function behaves as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "our background and the one showed in that reference differs by the transformation @xmath106 .",
    "it is no surprising that these models have similar behaviors .",
    "in fact , dp / dq systems and ads / qcd models are ads - like ( or conformal ads ) in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the photon emission rate obtained for both models ( right panels in figures [ fig : figone ] and [ fig : figtwo ] ) are also consistent with the qgp phenomenology .",
    "the emission occurs for small values of @xmath102 , where the ultrasoft behavior is expected @xcite .",
    "when @xmath102 is increased the photon emission is damped , according to the landau damping effect and debye screening : photons are reabsorbed by the medium and are suppressed . for high values of @xmath102 ,",
    "the emission goes to zero due to the reduction of bremsstrahlung and pair production , the so called landau  pomeranchuk ",
    "migdal effect @xcite .",
    "when the chemical potential is turned on , the chemical equilibrium is broken , implying that there is an excess in the quark ( or anti - quark ) population that makes the enhancement of the quark ( anti quark ) bremsstrahlung over their annihilation radiation , causing that the photon emission rate increases with the chemical potential for low energies @xcite .",
    "for all the @xmath101 values tested , the photon emission rates have common asymptotic behavior with large @xmath102 , demonstrating the expected universality in 4 + 1 strongly coupled plasmas .",
    "these results are in agreement with reference @xcite , where the photon emission rate was calculated starting from the dbi action instead of considering an ads rn black hole .",
    "holographically , turning on the chemical potential means the phase transition from the ads schwarzschild to the ads rn background .    in the figures [ fig : figthree ] and [ fig : figfour ]",
    "the ac and dc conductivities are plotted . in the hard wall case ,",
    "the real part of the ac conductivity ( left panel in both figures ) grows monotonically with @xmath102 up to a maximum , then it starts to oscillate . in the case of the soft wall model",
    ", the dilaton prevents that the real part of the ac conductivity begins to oscillate , damping the profile .",
    "in the case of the dc conductivity ( right panels ) , for both models it is increasing with the baryonic charge for a fixed temperature .",
    "this is expected since in the limit @xmath107 we are in the ultrasoft limit , where the chemical potential enhances the photon production by the reasons exposed above .",
    "in this work we have discussed the photon emission rate and the conductivity for hard wall and soft wall model under finite chemical potential regime .",
    "we have constructed holographically the chemical potential by means of an ads reissner  nordstrom black hole with a static electrical charge . in the perspective of qft ,",
    "the holographic procedure showed here is equivalent to consider all the feynman diagrams allowed by the landau  pomeranchuk ",
    "midgal effect that have photons as external legs .",
    "it is also interesting to comment that the results showed here are in agreement with other top / down models used to study photon emission @xcite despite the fact that they are constructed in different backgrounds , as in the case of the sakai sugimoto discussed in @xcite .",
    "the evidence that different holographic approaches can model the same phenomenology encodes an underlying nature : gravity can be connected to strong interactions in a deep way that we are just beginning to uncover .",
    "these models are a good approximation to the study of the excited colored matter created in heavy ion collisions",

    "<S> the results obtained in the hard wall and soft wall model are consistent with the observed phenomenology and they also in agree with other holographic results , as the d3/d7 or the sakai sugimoto models , suggesting the universality of ads / cft conjecture as tool to explore qcd . </S>"
