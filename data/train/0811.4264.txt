    "as mentioned before , we employ the @xmath0 renormalization scheme @xcite , which is more immediate for a lattice regularized theory .",

    "let us first express these bare green s functions in the following way :    @xmath85    it is worth noting here that terms which break lorentz invariance ( but are compatible with hypercubic invariance ) , such as @xmath86 , turn out to be absent from all bare green s functions ; thus , the latter have the same lorentz structure as in the continuum .",
