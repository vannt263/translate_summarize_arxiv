    "this paper is concerned with infrastructure mode wlans that use ieee 802.11 dcf mechanism .",
    "we are interested in analytical models for evaluating the performance of tcp - controlled downloads where each link experiences propagation delay .",
    "a detailed analysis of the aggregate throughput of tcp flows in wlans for a single rate access point ( ap ) ( where all stations ( stas ) are associated with the ap at a single rate ) is given in @xcite by assuming negligible or zero round trip time ( rtt ) .",
    "similarly , the performance of the ap is evaluated in the multi rate case in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however these works also ignore the rtt . here in our work",
    "we model the ap by considering round trip propagation delay ( rtpd ) and hence rtt .    in this paper , we are interested in obtaining analytical expressions for tcp - controlled long file transfer throughputs in case nonzero rtts . clearly , this is the case that is most relevant in practice .",
    "in addition , we allow stas to be associated with the ap at one of a number of possible rates ; for example , in 892.11 g , the rate association belongs to the set \\ { 54 , 48 , 36 , 24 , 18 , 12 , 6 } mbps .",
    "again this is common in practice , because stas can be at varying distances from the ap .",
    "we obtain the closed - form expressions and numerical evaluations apply them in other contexts of practical relevance .",
    "one such application , which we are working on now , is to utilize the results reported here in devising an improved ap - sta association scheme .",
    "our approach is divide the problem into two parts .",
    "the first part is to get the model to represent the number of stas with acks in mac queues as an embedded discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) , embedded at the instants of successful transmission events .",
    "we consider a successful transmission from the ap as a reward .",
    "this leads to viewing the aggregate tcp throughput in the framework of renewal reward theory as given for example in @xcite .",
    "we obtain expressions for network state probabilities , as well as the service rates of the ap and stas .",
    "the second part is to model the complete network , with nonzero rtt , as a closed bcmp queueing network @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the analytical model for tcp - controlled long file transfer throughput in a wlan with nonzero rtpd , using a bcmp queueing network .",
    "simulations indicate that download traffic scenario with rtpds , our numerical evaluation of analytical expression matches with error less than 3% .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : related_work ] outlines related work . in section [ sec : system_model ]",
    "we state the system model and we discuss the assumptions in the modelling . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we obtain throughput analysis . in section [ sec : evaluation ] , we present performance evaluation results . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we present some key observations on the model , and the results and we conclude the paper .",
    "numerous models and analyses have been proposed for wireless networks with tcp - controlled traffic , but very few consider propagation delays . in @xcite , rtt is considered in modelling the tcp traffic in a wlan . however , the authors interest was in showing that 802.11e supports features that can be exploited to overcome certain tcp performance anomalies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide a model for single rate ap - sta wlan assuming zero rtt and consider file transfers from a server located in the lan .",
    "an extension of this model in @xcite considers two rates of association with long file uploads from stas to a local server . the multirate case , with @xmath0 rates , is analysed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite considers the single rate case , but allows simultaneous tcp uploads and downloads with arbitrary maximum window sizes . @xcite and @xcite analyze tcp - controlled uploads and downloads in the presence of udp traffic .",
    "however , the effect of rtt on the network performance is ignored .",
    "the letter @xcite gives the average value analysis of tcp performance with upload and download traffic without considering rtt . in @xcite , finite buffer ap with tcp traffic in both upload and download direction",
    "is analysed with delayed and undelayed ack cases .",
    "they consider server system located on the ethernet to which the ap is connected and hence number of packets `` in flight '' outside the wlan is ignored .",
    "@xcite provides an analysis for a given number of stas and maximum tcp receive window size by using the well known @xmath1 persistent model proposed in @xcite .",
    "however both @xcite and @xcite do not consider the effect of rtt on the performance . in @xcite ,",
    "a queueing model is proposed to compute the mean session delay of http sessions in the presence of short - lived tcp flows and the impact of tcp maximum congestion window size on this delay is studied .",
    "we consider a wlan with @xmath2 stas are associated to an ap as shown in figure [ fig : ap_stas].the stas are downloading long files from a server which is far away from the local wireless network .",
    "hence there is a propagation delay between the ap and the server .",
    "every packet experiences this delay .",
    "the ap sends tcp data packets to these stas .",
    "the arrows in figure [ fig : ap_stas ] show the direction of the data packets in the network .",
    "since these are tcp links , there is also feedback traffic composed of tcp - ack packets .",
    "every sta has a single tcp connection.further , because of long file transfer scenario , we can assume that tcp sources are operating in congestion avoidance mode .",
    "hence tcp startup transients can be ignored .",
    "tcp windows grow to the maximum value possible , i.e. , the maximum receive window advertised by the receiver .",
    "also , tcp timeouts do not occur .",
    "both ap and sta contend for the channel using the dcf mechanism .",
    "we assume that there are no link errors .",
    "packets in the medium are lost only due to collisions .",
    "when the ap wins the channel , it delivers tcp data packets towards the sta and the sta returns tcp - ack packets again by contending and winning the channel .",
    "further , we assume that the ap uses the rts - cts mechanism while sending data packets , while the stas use basic access to send ack packets , which is more realistic and efficient as tcp - ack packets are much shorted than tcp data packets .",
    "as soon as the sta receives a data packet , it generates an ack packet without any delay and it is enqueued at the mac layer for transmission .",
    "we assume that all the nodes have sufficiently large buffers , so that packets are not lost due to buffer overflow .",
    "these ack packets travel through wired network and reach the server .",
    "again server generates next window of tcp data packets .",
    "all packets from server experience the propagation delay , reach the wlan and are enqueued at the ap to reach stas .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of stas associated with the ap at the phy rate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 with @xmath7 as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the probability that the ap sends a tcp data packet to an sta at rate @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "part of the development ( till equation ) is along the lines of @xcite ; this is included here for completeness and readability .",
    "are the random epochs at which successful transmissions end .",
    "random variable @xmath10 denotes the duration of the @xmath11 contention cycle @xmath12 .",
    "each contention cycle consists of one or more back off and collisions slots but ends with a successful transmission . ]",
    "consider figure [ fig : channel_activity ] , where a possible sample path of the events on the wlan channel is shown .",
    "the random epochs @xmath13 indicate the end of the @xmath14 successful transmission from either the ap or one of the stas .",
    "we begin by assuming that each @xmath15 is large .",
    "we observe that most stas have empty mac queues , because , in order for many stas to have tcp - ack packets , the ap must have had a long run of successes  and this is unlikely because no special priority is given to the ap .",
    "so , when the ap succeeds in transmitting , the packet is likely to be for an sta with an empty mac queue",
    ".    let @xmath16 be the number of stas at rate @xmath8 , ready with an ack .",
    "let @xmath17 be the number of nonempty stas .",
    "since there are @xmath18 nonempty stas and a nonempty ap , each nonempty wlan entity attempts to transmit with probability @xmath19 as in @xcite .",
    "so @xmath20 evolves as a discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) over the epochs @xmath13 .",
    "this allows us to consider @xmath21 as a markov renewal sequence , and @xmath22 as a semi - markov process .",
    "we have a multidimensional dtmc which is shown in figure [ fig : markovchain ] ; transition probabilities are indicated as well ( we used in @xmath23 as running index ) . by inspection",
    ", we can say that the dtmc is irreducible .",
    "the detailed balance equation holds for a properly chosen set of equilibrium probabilities .",
    "the dbe is     stations associated with the ap at @xmath24 different data rates ]    @xmath25    here @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the stationary distribution of the dtmc . from the set of equations given in and @xmath28 ,",
    "the stationary distribution is @xmath29 let @xmath30 be the sojourn time in a state @xmath31 .",
    "conditioning on various events ( idle slot , collision or successful transmission ) that can happen in the next time slot , the following expression for the mean cycle length can be written down : + @xmath32 in the above expression , @xmath33 is the probability of the slot being idle .",
    "@xmath34 is the probability that the ap wins the contention and transmits the data packet with rate @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the probability that the sta wins the contention and transmits the data packet with rate @xmath35 .",
    "detailed expressions are tabulated in @xcite . in the above expression",
    ", collisions correspond to different cases are as follows .",
    "first , the third term in arises when the ap transmits a tcp data packet to an sta at rate @xmath8 and some other stas are involved in a collision .",
    "the second case ( fifth term in ) corresponds to an sta transmitting a tcp ack packet to the ap at rate @xmath8 and some other node transmitting simultaneously . in the above expression ,",
    "various probabilities have been obtained by considering the events and using channel access probability @xmath37,when there are @xmath38 contending nodes .    from equation",
    "we have @xmath39 @xmath40 in equation [ eq : enx ] , calculations of probabilities and times are shown in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in finding long run time average of successful transmissions from the ap .",
    "this leads to markov regenerative analysis or the renewal reward theorem approach . to get mean renewal cycle length",
    ", we can use the mean sojourn time given in equation .",
    "the mean reward in a cycle can be obtained as follows .",
    "a reward of 1 is earned when the ap transmits a tcp data packet successfully by winning the channel .",
    "the probability of the ap winning the channel is @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the semi markov process exits the state @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 .",
    "a reward of 0 is earned with the probability @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the expected reward is @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the aggregate tcp throughput for the ap in this case can be calculated as + @xmath46 we are also interested in finding the mean tcp throughput for the stas .",
    "a reward of 1 is counted when any sta transmits a tcp - ack packet successfully by winning the contention .",
    "the probability of sta at rate @xmath4 winning the contention is @xmath47 .",
    "a reward of 0 is counted with probability @xmath48 .",
    "hence the tcp throughput for the sta at rate @xmath4 is + @xmath49      we can model the scenario shown in figure [ fig : ap_stas ] as a bcmp closed queueing network @xcite with service centers as shown in figure [ fig : threeqs ] .",
    "we consider rtpd as a delay center .",
    "once wireless specific aspects are captured in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we consider the bcmp network service centres as if they were linked by regular wired links .",
    "this is a modelling assumption for tractability .",
    "let us consider @xmath52 packets in this network .",
    "the queues in this network representing the ap and sta are first come first served queues ( fcfs ) which are `` type 1 '' service centres in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "similarly , the queue representing round trip propagation delay ( rtpd ) is an infinite server queue with deterministic service time , which is a `` type 3 '' service center .",
    "let the service rate of the ap be @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider @xmath54 packets to be at center 0 .",
    "that is , @xmath54 among @xmath52 packets are in the ap .",
    "also , let @xmath55 out of @xmath52 packets be in center 1 , which is an sta at rate @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 packets in center correspond to sta @xmath5 .",
    "the remaining packets we say @xmath58 are in the delay center .",
    "the state of the network can be represented by @xmath59 , as in @xcite .",
    "the definitions of @xmath60 depend on the type of the service center @xmath5 and are given in @xcite .",
    "let there be @xmath61 stas at rate @xmath62 .",
    "stas at a particular rate constitute customers of a particular class in the bcmp network .",
    "we have @xmath63 .",
    "every transition is both a departure from one center and an arrival at another center . for every @xmath5 ,",
    "let @xmath64 be the fraction of transitions that are arrivals at ( departures from ) center @xmath5 .",
