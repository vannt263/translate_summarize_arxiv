    "some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is likewise argued @xcite that stellar masses derived from optical - infrared photometry may suffer biases that lead to large uncertainties in the inferred growth rate . beyond such concerns , interpreting the observed evolution in the context of the @xmath8cdm paradigm necessitates appealing to potentially uncertain semi - analytic models .",
    "clearly what is needed is a way to connect observations of galaxy growth directly to the assembly history of the halos in which they reside .",
    "spheroidal galaxies offer particular advantages in this regard .",
    "first , because of their regular mass profiles , spectroscopic observations can be used to infer the dynamical mass , bypassing luminous quantities .",
    "second , because of their pressure - supported dynamical configurations , they are expected to result , for the most part , from mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "accordingly , their evolving abundances can be compared directly to the expected assembly history of dark matter halos . in this letter",

    "when comparing @xmath2 to @xmath1 we employ the more strict , volume - limited limits at the far edge of each interval ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we begin by restricting our analysis to those 125 spheroidals in goods - n for which both @xmath1 and @xmath2 measurements are available . the aim is to develop scaling relations that can be applied to the larger goods - n / s sample . for local galaxies , a fairly tight correlation of the form",

    "this choice corresponds to @xmath30 and 6.6 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 and is motivated by the fact that the @xmath17 depends on the mass density profile and , most importantly , on the spectroscopic aperture used to measure @xmath18 . since the aperture is effectively redshift - dependent ( the slit width is fixed at 1 ) , assuming a constant @xmath17 could introduce a spurious redshift dependency .",
    "similarly , while there is no evidence that the density profile evolves for high mass spheroidals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "with regard to what follows , the key result in figure [ relplot ] is that @xmath34 shows no measurable evolution across our sample . in @xmath40[section : dmf ] , we will show that this leads to dynamical mfs that behave similarly to their stellar mass counterparts . for consistency , final @xmath1 estimates for galaxies in the full goods sample",
    "are determined using the value of @xmath34 determined for the two redshift bins , and the final uncertainty in @xmath1 is taken to be the sum in quadrature of the uncertainty in @xmath2 and the scatter in figure [ relplot ] .",
    "using the @xmath1 estimates derived above for the full goods sample , we now construct the dynamical mf and compare with its stellar mass counterpart in the top two panels of figure [ lvm_comp ] .",
    "we use the @xmath41 estimator and closely follow the method described in @xcite .",

    "the bottom panel of figure [ lvm_comp ] shows the differential growth derived across the two redshift bins .",
    "figure [ lvm_comp ] demonstrates consistency between the stellar mfs and dynamical mfs . although our adopted zeropoint in the @xmath1 relations ensures a similar vertical normalization , the application of our scaling relations does not mean both mfs should have the same shape .",
    "indeed , small differences are noticeable in our highest mass bin . the good agreement results in large part from the fact that the @xmath1@xmath2 relation does not vary significantly across our sample . had a variation in @xmath34 with redshift been present in figure [ relplot ]",
    ", the resulting dynamical mfs would evolve with respect to the stellar mfs .",
    "the fact the two agree validates earlier stellar mass estimates at @xmath5 and the top - down growth in the abundance of spheroidals derived from those measures .",
    "we now turn to the key question which our analysis can address : is the rising abundance with time of spheroidal galaxies consistent with that predicted by the growth of merging dark matter halos ? to answer this question we adopt a simple , observationally - motivated model to connect @xmath18 and @xmath2 to the virial mass , @xmath4 , of the host halos",
    ". lensing studies of early - type galaxies at @xmath43 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) show that the total mass density profile of spheroidal halos is nearly isothermal within the halo scale radius , @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore assume a mass profile that is isothermal for @xmath45 and follows a @xmath46 profile ( nfw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the @xmath46 behavior at large radii ( @xmath48 ) is consistent with non - nfw scaling laws which can disagree instead at small radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass profile assumed here is given by @xmath49^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath18 is the observed central velocity dispersion and we have introduced the scaling parameter , @xmath50 , which can be used to tune the profile shape to observations . by comparing to @xcite , we find @xmath51future observations will constrain @xmath50 as a function of redshift and mass .",
    "we define @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cosmic critical density , @xmath54 is the overdensity parameter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath55 . the concentration , @xmath56 , is assumed to the follow the relation found in simulations , @xmath57 @xcite . using this model and the relations above , we solve for @xmath4 as a function of velocity dispersion and find ,    @xmath58    where @xmath4 has units of @xmath59m@xmath29 , @xmath60 is the velocity dispersion in units of 200 km s@xmath12 , and the fit parameters are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "equation [ eqn_sigma ] follows from the model described above and so random uncertainties on the fitting parameters are negligible .",
    "however , systematic errors resulting from tuning this model to observations should reflect the uncertainty found by @xcite of 0.2 dex . using our kinematic sample for which we measure both @xmath18 and @xmath2",
    ", we can also directly compare @xmath4 and @xmath2 , finding the following relation :    @xmath64    where a chabrier imf was assumed as before and @xmath65 has units of @xmath66m@xmath29 .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 dex and accounts for the systematic uncertainty in equation [ eqn_sigma ] ( 0.2 dex ) as well as uncertainty in the stellar imf ( 0.15 dex ) . equations 1 and 2 are applicable for galaxies with @xmath71 and @xmath72 kms@xmath12 .",
    "equation [ eqn_mstar ] gives values of @xmath73 , consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that our marginally non - zero value of @xmath74 , if confirmed , implies a slight increase with time of @xmath75 ( @xmath7630% ) over @xmath77 that is consistent with halo growth ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and independent evidence that stellar mass assembly is mostly completed by @xmath78 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that virial mass and stellar mass turn out to be approximately in linear proportion within this mass range .",
    "studies with a larger dynamical range in stellar masses and velocity dispersion , and more weak lensing measurements , are needed to measure the slope with higher precision and detect departures from linearity , expected as a result of varying star formation efficiency with halo mass .",
    "using equation [ eqn_mstar ] we estimate halo virial masses for our sample and compare the resulting virial mfs in the top panel of figure [ mvm_evol ] .",
    "the dashed line is the total halo mass function predicted at @xmath79 ( it evolves little over @xmath80 ) using the online millennium simulation database  @xmath81mpc@xmath82 , nearly 4 times larger than our largest sampled volume at @xmath83 . ]",
    "@xcite and adjusted in number density by @xmath840.1 dex to be consistent with the spheroidal mfs ( this adjustment is within the expected cosmic variance of 0.15 dex ) .",
    "the dotted line shows a local ( @xmath85 ) estimate constructed by converting the @xmath2 mf for early - types ( based on concentration , @xmath86 ) measured by @xcite into a virial mf using equation [ eqn_mstar ] .",
    "adjustments of @xmath840.1 dex were also applied to the local number density and the local mass scale to match the goods sample at high masses .",
    "such corrections are likely needed as a result of cosmic variance , differing selection and mass estimate methods , and photometric uncertainties .",
    "thus , comparisons between our results and the local mf must be done with caution .",
    "the top panel of figure [ mvm_evol ] reveals a similar pattern of evolution as seen in figure [ lvm_comp ] .",
    "a useful interpretation of this evolution is given in the bottom panel of figure [ mvm_evol ] which plots the @xmath87 _ difference _",
    "( @xmath88 ) , thereby displaying the halo mf of new spheroidals that have appeared over the time interval separating the two redshift windows and providing a way to compare with the incidence of halo mergers .",
    "we use the mpahalo milli - millennium database to identify halos that have experienced a recent merger , at which point two previously separate halos or subhalos become a single halo .",
    "halo merging often occurs several gyr after halo accretion , defined by the point at which the two progenitor halos first become associated with the same friends - of - friends ( fof ) group . because the smaller progenitor halo may experience significant tidal stripping after halo accretion but before merging ( see *",
    "* ) , we take the merger mass ratio to be the initial ratio before halo accretion .    after integrating over the two time intervals that separate our observations , we overplot two merging scenarios in the bottom panel of figure [ mvm_evol ] ( the @xmath840.1 dex vertical offset is also applied ) .",
    "it is a striking result that major halo mergers ( mass ratios greater than 1:3 , indicated by dark lines ) can not account for the rise of spheroidal systems over the two epochs probed here .",
    "the light yellow lines ( without symbols ) show this is still the case when a @xmath760.5 gyr delay is added to the merger timescale ( as suggested by expected differences in the galaxy and halo merger times ) .",
    "we note that at the highest masses probed there is an indication that the predicted merger frequency rises above the growth of new spheroidals .",
    "this might be expected since most systems at such masses already exhibit spheroidal morphologies by these redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting such interactions represent `` dry '' mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "by constructing dynamical mass functions for 393 field spheroidals and linking those mass estimates to the halos in which they reside , we have found a significant result in the bottom panel of figure [ mvm_evol ] : major merging of dark matter halos as described by @xmath8cdm does not occur frequently enough to explain the observed increase in the mass function of spheroidal galaxies .",
    "a check made by appealing to the semi - analytic model of @xcite shows a similar result when a galaxy s stellar mass is used to define recent mergers and even when @xmath2 is used as the `` accounting variable . ''",
    "if merging is not the only mechanism that produces newly - formed spheroidals since @xmath5 , other physical processes likely play a significant role .",
    "these may include mechanisms for transforming disk and irregular galaxies into relaxed spheroidals , for example secular bulge growth accompanied by disk fading .",
    "indeed , recent semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have required prescriptions for such mechanisms , in addition to mergers , to match the local abundance of spheroidals .",
    "more work is needed to understand these processes and their role in morphological evolution .",
