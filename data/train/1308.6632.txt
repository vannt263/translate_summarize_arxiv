    "in this paper , we are interested in constructing a free energy satisfying numerical method for solving the initial boundary value problem for the poisson  nernst  planck ( pnp ) equations , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the concentration of ion species , @xmath2 denotes a connected closed domain with smooth boundary @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the potential governed by the poisson equation which is necessary to determine the electrostatic field , and @xmath5 is the unit outward normal vector .",
    "subject to the given initial and boundary conditions , the compatibility condition @xmath6 is necessarily to be imposed for solvability of the problem . by free - energy satisfying",
    "we mean that the free energy dissipation law is satisfied at the discrete level .",
    "the pnp equations describe the diffusion of ions under the effect of an electric field that is itself caused by those same ions .",
    "the system couples the nernst - planck ( np ) equation ( which describes the drift of ions in a potential gradient by ohm s law and diffusion of ions in a concentration gradient by fick s law ) and the poisson equation ( which relates charge density with electric potential ) .",
    "this system of equations for multiple species has been extensively used in the modeling of semiconductors ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and the membrane transport in biological ion channels ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pnp system can hardly be solved analytically .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the nonlinear coupling of the electrostatic potential and concentrations of chemical species .",
    "when the physical domain has a simple geometry , a semi - explicit formula was derived in @xcite for the steady - state solution ; the existence and stability of the steady - state solution was established a long while ago @xcite in the study of the steady van roostbroeck model in semiconductors .",
    "it has been proved by h. gajewski and k. grtner in @xcite that the solution to the drift - diffusion system converges to the thermal equilibrium state as time becomes large if the boundary conditions are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the key - point of the proof is an energy estimate with the control of the free energy dissipation .",
    "long time behavior was also studied in @xcite , and further in @xcite with refined convergence rates .    in the past decade a growing interest in pnp systems has been driven mainly by experimental and numerical advances .",
    "computational algorithms have been constructed for both simple one - dimensional settings and complex three - dimensional models in various chemical / biological applications , and have been combined with the brownian dynamics simulations ; cf.@xcite .",
    "many of these existing algorithms are introduced to handle specific settings in complex applications , in which one may encounter different numerical obstacles , such as discontinuous coefficients , singular charges , geometric singularities , and nonlinear couplings to accommodate various phenomena exhibited by biological ion channels @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite developed a finite difference scheme for liquid junction and ion selective membrane potentials , in which authors used a fully implicit discretization scheme and the newton - raphson solver for the resulting linear system . in @xcite ,",
    "a 3d finite element method for the system with a singular ( point - like ) charge outside of the concentration region was developed .",
    "a second order pnp solver was developed in @xcite in a realistic ion - channel context with the dirichlet boundary condition . in spite of many existing computational studies",
    ", rigorous numerical analysis seems to be still lacking .",
    "our objective is to construct and analyze an explicit second - order pnp algorithm to incorporate main mathematical features of the pnp system so that the numerical solution remains faithful for long time simulations , i.e. , the numerical solution possesses desired properties including conservation of ions , positivity of concentration and dissipation of the free energy .",
    "therefore we consider only the standard pnp equations of form ( [ pnp ] ) , while the reader may find intensive discussions of the modeling aspect of the pnp system in the literature .",
    "the main properties of the solution to ( [ pnp ] ) are the nonnegativity principle , the mass conservation and the free energy dissipation , i.e. , @xmath7 where the free energy @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 dx.\\ ] ] if @xmath10 does not depend on time , we can use a modified functional @xmath11 so that @xmath12 these properties are also naturally desired for numerical methods solving ( [ pnp ] ) . in this paper , we develop such a method . we will demonstrate that these properties of the numerical methods could be critical in obtaining the long - time behavior of the solutions .",
    "it is difficult for numerical schemes to preserve all three properties for pnp equations exactly at the discrete level .",
    "a recent effort toward this direction is found in @xcite , where the authors present an implicit second order finite difference scheme with a simple iteration so that the energy dissipation law is approximated closely .",
    "the free energy dissipation in time is also the driving force so that the large time behavior of the solution to ( [ pnp ] ) is governed by the steady - state solution .",
    "in fact , the steady - state solution is necessarily of the form @xmath13 , which gives @xmath14 , and @xmath15 can be further determined by integration of the poisson equation while using the neumann boundary data . in other words ,",
    "the pnp system near steady states is close to a poisson  boltzmann equation ( pbe ) @xmath16 therefore , the numerical method presented in this paper may be used as an iterative algorithm to numerically compute such a nonlocal pbe .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a rigorous study of a nonlocal poisson  boltzmann type equation with a small dielectric parameter as derived from the two - species pnp system .",
    "in general , the pbe describes the electrostatic interaction and ionic density distributions of a solvated system at the equilibrium state . due to the effectiveness of the pbe for applications in chemistry and biophysics , a large amount of literatures and many solution techniques",
    "have been produced in this area and directed to studies of diverse biological processes , see e.g. @xcite .      in a larger context",
    ", the concentration equation falls into the general class of aggregation equations with diffusion @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "such a model has been widely studied in applications such as biological swarms @xcite and chemotaxis @xcite . for chemotaxis ,",
    "a wide literature exists in relation to the keller - segel model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the left - hand - side in ( [ u ] ) represents the active transport of the density @xmath1 associated to a non - local velocity field @xmath19 .",
    "the potential @xmath20 is assumed to incorporate attractive interactions among individuals of the group , while repulsive ( anti - crowding ) interactions are accounted for by the diffusion in the right - hand - side .    of central role in studies of model ( [ u ] ) , and also",
    "particularly relevant to the present research , is the gradient flow formulation of the equation with respect to the free energy @xmath21=\\int_{\\omega } c \\log c dx -\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\omega}\\int_{\\omega } g(x - y)c(x)c(y)dxdy.\\ ] ] the free energy contains both entropic part and the interaction part . there is a vast literature on entropic schemes for kinetic equations such as fokker - planck type equations . for these equations ,",
    "information carried by the probability density becomes less and less as time evolves , the probability density is expected to converge to the equilibrium solution in a closed system regardless of how initial data are distributed .",
    "the entropy dissipation in time is the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon .",
    "the entropy satisfying methods recently developed in @xcite are the main motivation for this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the algorithm for the one dimensional case .",
    "theoretical analysis for both semi - discrete and full discrete schemes is provided .",
    "we also discuss how the poisson equation is solved .",
    "numerical results of both one and two dimensions are presented in section 3 . finally , in section 4 , concluding remarks are given .",
    "following @xcite , we formally reformulate the system by setting @xmath22 to obtain @xmath23 with this reformulation , an iterative algorithm may be designed as follows : given @xmath1 we obtain @xmath4 by solving the poisson equation @xmath24 which determines @xmath25 ; we further update @xmath1 by solving ( [ cg ] ) , ( [ gn ] ) .",
    "we shall describe our numerical algorithm in one dimensional setting only , with one or multi - species .",
    "the algorithm is extensible to high dimensional case in a straightforward dimension by dimension manner .    in the one dimensional case with",

    "we obtain @xmath30 which is exactly the compatibility condition stated in ( [ compatibility ] ) .",
    "if @xmath31 are independent of time , we set @xmath32 a direct calculation gives @xmath33 we now describe our algorithm by first partitioning the domain @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and interior grid points @xmath37      * we use @xmath38 to approximate @xmath39 and @xmath40 to approximate @xmath41 , respectively . given @xmath42 ,",
    "we compute the potential @xmath4 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . for definiteness , we set @xmath46 at any time @xmath47 to single out a particular solution since @xmath4 is unique up to an additive constant . * with the above obtained @xmath48 , the semi - discrete approximation of the concentration @xmath1 satisfies @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "the one - dimensional algorithm needs to be modified : ( [ pc ] ) is replaced by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , in order to solve the poisson equation ( [ mc]b ) , and each @xmath62 is obtained from solving @xmath63 where in the formula for @xmath64 the potential is replaced by @xmath65 . for the multi - dimensional case",
    ", the algorithm can be applied in a dimension by dimension manner .",
    "we illustrate these cases by numerical examples later .    the above algorithm can be easily modified to solve the pnp equations with more physical parameters :    [ mc+ ] @xmath66    where @xmath59 is the ion density for the @xmath67-th species , @xmath58 is the charge of @xmath59",

    "it is also possible to generalize the schemes presented in this work to second order finite difference schemes on non - uniform meshes , yet the analysis would appear more complicated .",
    "the numerical solution obtained from the above algorithm has some desired properties as stated in the following .",
    "* both semi - discrete scheme ( [ tc ] ) and euler forward discretization ( [ cq ] ) are conservative in the sense that the total concentration @xmath38 remains unchanged in time , @xmath74 * the discrete concentration @xmath75 remains positive in time : if @xmath76 , then @xmath77 provided the condition @xmath78 where @xmath79 * the semi - discrete free energy @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 therefore nonincreasing .",
    "* we first prove the conservation and .",
    "since @xmath82 we have @xmath83 where we have used the zero flux boundary condition @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , summation of ( [ cq ] ) over @xmath86 gives @xmath87 * define @xmath88 , the boundary condition gives @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "let mesh ratio be denoted by @xmath91 , we can rewrite ( [ cq ] ) as @xmath92 from the discrete poisson equation @xmath93 it follows that @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
