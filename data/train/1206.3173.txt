    "the thin photosphere of the sun , where thermal transport is dominated by free - streaming radiation , shows a spectrum in which granulation and supergranulation are most prominent .",
    "observed properties of granules , such as spatial scales , radiative intensity and photospheric spectral - line formation are successfully reproduced by numerical simulations @xcite . in contrast , convection in the interior is not directly observable and likely governed by aspects more difficult to model , such as the integrity of descending plumes to diffusion and various instabilities @xcite .",
    "further , solar convection is governed by extreme parameters @xcite ( prandtl number @xmath4 , rayleigh number @xmath5 , and reynolds number @xmath6 ) , which make fully resolved three - dimensional direct numerical simulations impossible for the foreseeable future .",
    "it is likewise difficult to reproduce them in laboratory experiments .",
    "turning to phenomenology , mixing - length theory ( mlt ) is predicated on the assumption that parcels of fluid of a specified spatial and velocity scale transport heat over one length scale ( termed the _ mixing length _ ) and are then mixed in the new environment . while this picture is simplistic @xcite , it has been successful in predicting aspects of solar structure as well as the dominant scale and magnitude of observed surface velocities .",
    "mlt posits a spatial convective scale that increases with depth ( while velocities reduce ) and coherent large scales of convection , termed _",
    "giant cells_. simulations of anelastic global convection @xcite , more sophisticated than mlt , support the classical picture of a turbulent cascade .",
    "the ash simulations @xcite solve the non - linear compressible navier - stokes equations in the anelastic limit , i.e. , where acoustic waves , which oscillate at very different timescales , are filtered out .",
    "considerable effort has been spent in attempting surface @xcite and interior detection @xcite of giant cells , but evidence supporting their existence has remained inconclusive .",
    "here , we image the solar interior using time - distance helioseismology @xcite . raw data in this analysis are line - of - sight photospheric doppler velocities measured by the helioseismic and magnetic imager @xcite onboard the solar dynamics observatory .",
    "two - point correlations from temporal segments of length @xmath7 of the observed doppler wavefield velocities are formed and spatially averaged according to a deep - focusing geometry @xcite ( figures  [ hmifig ] and  [ rays ] ) .",
    "we base the choice of @xmath7 on estimates of convective coherence timescales @xcite .",
    "these correlations are then fitted to a reference gabor wavelet function @xcite to obtain travel - time shifts @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are co - latitude and longitude on the observed solar disk . by construction ,",
    "these time shifts are sensitive to different components of 3d vector flows , i.e. , longitudinal , latitudinal or radial , at specific depths of the solar interior ( @xmath10 ) and consequently , we denote individual flow components ( longitudinal or latitudinal ) by scalars .",
    "each point @xmath11 on the travel - time map is constructed by correlating 600 pairs of points on opposing quadrants .",
    "a sample travel - time map is shown in figure  [ tt.map ] .",

    "3.2 billion wavefield measurements were analyzed to generate 10 million correlations , which were averaged and fitted to generate this travel time map .",
    "this geometry and these particular wave times are so chosen as to be sensitive to flow systems in the solar interior .",
    "the spectrum of these travel times shows no interesting or anomalous peaks that meet the detection criteria ( described subsequently ) . ]",
    "waves are stochastically excited in the sun , because of which the above correlation and travel - time measurements include components of incoherent wave noise , whose variance @xcite diminishes as @xmath12 .",
    "the variance of time shifts induced by convective structures that retain their coherence over timescale @xmath7 does _ not _ diminish as @xmath12 , allowing us to distinguish them from noise .",
    "we may therefore describe the total travel - time variance @xmath13 as the sum of variances of signal @xmath14 and noise @xmath15 , assuming that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are statistically independent .",
    "angled brackets denote ensemble averaging over measurements of @xmath18 from many independent segments of temporal length @xmath7 . given a coherence time @xmath19 , we fit @xmath20 over @xmath21 to obtain the integral upper limit @xmath16 .",
    "the fraction of the observed travel - time variance that can not be modeled as uncorrelated noise is therefore @xmath22 . for averaging lengths @xmath19 (= 24 and 96 hours ) considered here",
    ", we find this signal to be small , i.e. , @xmath23 , which leads us to conclude that large - scale convective flows are weak in magnitude .",
    "further , since surface supergranulation contributes to @xmath16 , our estimates form an upper bound on ordered convective motions .",
    "[ kernels ]    [ bounds ]    spatial scales on spherical surfaces are well characterized in spherical harmonic space : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are spherical harmonics , @xmath26 are spherical harmonic degree and order , respectively , and @xmath27 are spherical harmonic coefficients . here",
    ", we specifically define the term  scale \" to denote @xmath28 , which implies that small scales correspond to large @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "note that a spatial ensemble of small convective structures such as a granules or inter - granular lanes ( e.g. , as observed on the solar photosphere ) can lead to a broad power spectrum that has both small scales and large scales .",
    "the power spectrum of an ensemble of small structures , such as granulation patterns seen at the photosphere , leads to a broad distribution in @xmath0 , which we term here as _",
    "scales_. travel - time shifts @xmath29 , induced by a convective flow component @xmath30 , are given in the single - scattering limit by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the sensitivity of the measurement to that flow component .",
    "the variance of flow - induced time shifts at every scale is bounded by the variance of the signal in observed travel times , i.e. , @xmath33 . to complete the analysis , we derive sensitivity kernels @xmath34 that allow us to deduce flow components in the interior , given the associated travel - time shifts ( i.e. , the _ inverse _ problem ) .",
    "the time - distance deep - focusing measurement @xcite is calibrated by linearly simulating waves propagating through spatially small flow perturbations , implanted at 500 randomly distributed ( known ) locations , on a spherical shell at a given interior depth ( figure  [ kernels ] ) .",
    "this delta - populated flow system contains a full spectrum , i.e. , its power extends from small to large spherical harmonic degrees .",
    "the simulated data are then filtered both spatially and temporally in order to isolate waves that propagate to the specific depth of interest ( termed phase - speed filtering ) .",
    "travel times of these waves are then measured for focus depths the same as the depths of the features , and subsequently corrected for stochastic excitation noise @xcite .",
    "note that these corrections may only be applied to simulated data - this is because we have full knowledge of the realization of sources that we put in .",
    "longitudinal and radial flow perturbations are analyzed through separate simulations , giving us access to the full vector sensitivity of this measurement to flows .",
    "travel - time maps from the simulations appear as a low - resolution version of the input perturbation map because of diffraction associated with finite wavelengths of acoustic waves excited in the sun and in the simulations .",
    "the connection between the two maps is primarily a function of spherical - harmonic degree @xmath0 . to quantify the connection ,",
    "both images are transformed and a linear regression is performed between coefficients of the two transforms at each @xmath0 separately ( see online supplementary material for details ) .",
    "the slope of this linear regression is the calibration factor for degree @xmath0 .",
    "we apply similar analyses to 27 days of data ( one solar rotation ) taken by the helioseismic and magnetic imager from june - july 2010 .",
    "these images are tracked at the carrington rotation rate , interpolated onto a fine latitude - longitude grid , smoothed with a gaussian , and resampled at the same resolution as the simulations ( 0.46875 deg / pixel ) .",
    "the data are transformed to spherical harmonic space and temporal fourier domain , phase - speed filtered ( as described earlier ) and transformed back to the real domain . cross correlations and travel times are computed with the same programs as used on the simulations .",
    "strips of 13 deg of longitude and the full latitude range are extracted from each of the 27 days results and combined into a synoptic map covering a solar rotation .",
    "the coefficients from the spherical harmonic transform of this map are converted , at each degree @xmath0 , by the calibration slope mentioned above , and a resultant flow spectrum is derived , as shown in figure  [ bounds ] . these form observational upper bounds on the magnitude of turbulent flows in the convection zone at the scales to which the measurements are sensitive .",
    "it is seen that constraints in figure  [ bounds ] become poorer with greater imaging depth .",
    "this may be attributed to diffraction , which limits seismic spatial resolution to approximately a wavelength . in turn",
    ", the acoustic wavelength , proportional to sound speed , increases with depth .",
    "since density also grows rapidly with depth , the velocity required to transport the heat flux of a solar luminosity decreases , a prediction echoed by all theories of solar convection .",
    "thus we may reasonably conclude that the @xmath35 curve is also the upper bound for convective velocities at deeper layers in the convective zone ( although the constraint at @xmath36 curve is weaker due to a coarser diffraction limit ) .",
    "less restrictive constraints obtained at depths @xmath37 ( whose quality is made worse by the poor signal - to - noise ratio ) are not displayed here .",
    "the spectral distribution of power due to an ensemble of convective structures , of spatial sizes small or large or both , will be broad .",
    "for example , it has been argued ( @xcite ) that photospheric convection comprises only granules and supergranules , and that the power spectrum of an ensemble of these structures would extend from the lowest to highest @xmath0 . in other words , if granulation - related flow velocities were to be altered , the _ entire _ power spectrum would be affected .",
    "thus the large scales which we image here ( i.e. , power for low @xmath0 ) , contain contributions from small and large structures alike , and represent , albeit in a complicated and incomplete manner , gross features of the transport mechanism .",
    "our constraints show that for wavenumbers @xmath38 , flow velocities associated with solar convection ( @xmath35 ) are substantially smaller than current predictions .",
    "alternately one may interpret the constraints as a statement that the temporal coherence of convective structures is substantially shorter than predicted by current theories .",
    "analysis of numerical simulations ( @xcite ) of solar convection shows that a dominant fraction ( @xmath39% ) of the heat transport is effected by the small scales , however , our observations show that the simulated velocities are substantially over - estimated in the wavenumber band @xmath38 , placing in question ( based on the preceding argument ) the entire predicted spectrum of convective flows and the conclusions derived thereof .",
    "we further state that we lack definitive knowledge on the energy - carrying scales in the convection zone .",
    "we may thus ask : how would this paradigm of turbulence affect extant theories of dynamo action ?    for example , consider the scenario discussed by @xcite , who envisaged very weak upflows , which , seeded at the base of the convection zone , grow to ever larger scales due to the decreasing density as they buoyantly rise .",
    "these flows are in mass balance with cool inter - granular plumes which , formed at the photosphere , are squeezed ever more so as they plunge into the interior .",
    "such a mechanism presupposes that these descending plumes fall nearly ballistically through the convection zone , almost as if a cold sleet , amid warm upwardly diffusing plasma . in this schema",
    ", individual structures associated with the transport process would elude detection because the upflows would be too weak and the downflows of too small a structural size ( m. schssler , private communication , 2011 ) . when viewed in terms of spherical harmonics , the associated velocities at large scales ( i.e. , low @xmath0 ) , which contain contributions from both upflows and descending plumes ,",
    "would also be small .",
    "whatever mechanism may prevail , the stability of descending plumes at high rayleigh and reynolds numbers and very low prandtl number is likely to play a central role ( @xcite ) .",
    "differential rotation , a large - scale feature ( @xmath40 ) , is one individual global flow system and easily detected in our travel - time maps .",
    "differential rotation is the only feature we  detect \" within this wavenumber band .",
    "in other words , upon subtracting this @xmath41 feature from the travel - time maps , the variance of the remnant falls roughly as @xmath12 , where @xmath7 is the temporal averaging length , suggesting the non - existence of other structures at these scales .",
    "consequently , we may assert that we do not see evidence for a  classical \" inverse cascade that results in the production of a smooth distribution of scales .",
    "current models of solar dynamo action posit that differential rotation drives the process of converting poloidal to toroidal flux .",
    "this would result in a continuous loss of energy from the differentially rotating convective envelope and reynolds stresses have long been thought of as a means to replenish and sustain the angular velocity gradient .",
    "the low rossby numbers in our observations indicate that turbulence is geostrophically arranged over wavenumbers @xmath38 at the depth @xmath35 , further implying very weak reynolds stresses .",
    "because flow velocities are likely to become weaker with depth in the convection zone , the rossby numbers will decrease correspondingly . at wavenumbers of @xmath40 , the thermal wind balance equation describing geostrophic turbulence likely holds extremely well within most of the convection zone : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean solar rotation rate , @xmath44 is the differential rotation , @xmath45 is the axis of rotation , @xmath46 is the latitude , @xmath47 is a constant , @xmath16 is the azimuthally and temporally averaged entropy gradient .",
    "differential rotation around @xmath40 is helioseismically well constrained , i.e. , the left side of equation  ( [ geostrophy ] ) is accurately known ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the iso - rotation contours are not co - aligned with the axis of rotation , yielding a non - zero left side of equation  ( [ geostrophy ] ) .",
    "taylor - proudman balance is broken and we may reasonably infer that the sun does indeed possess a latitudinal entropy gradient , of a suitable form so as to sustain solar differential rotation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred weakness of reynolds stresses poses a problem to theories of meridional circulation , which rely on the former to effect angular momentum transport in order to sustain the latter .",
    "very weak turbulent stresses would imply a correspondingly weak meridional circulation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
