    "the @xmath0 model in 3 dimensions is an interesting system in statistical mechanics .",
    "physically it describes the critical behaviour of superfluid @xmath1@xcite . from the theoretical point of view it provides a relatively simple example of an order - disorder phase transition in which the condensation of solitons plays an essential role[2 - 5 ] .",
    "it is fairly well established that the transition is continuous , and the basic critical indices are known with good precision@xcite .",
    "a ginzburg - landau kind of description of the system has been given , describing phenomenologically the condensation of vortices in the high temperature phase@xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall study the system from a slightly different point of view .",
    "we shall look at it as the lattice formulation of a 2 + 1 dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "we shall then show that the ( 2 dimensional ) ground state of the theory spontaneously breaks the conservation of the number of vortices at high temperature ; vortices condense in the vacuum in the same way as cooper pairs do in a superconductor . in that phase the number of vortices is not defined in the vacuum , which is a superposition of states with different vorticity .",
    "we shall directly exhibit this condensation by showing that the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of an operator which changes the number of vortices is non zero .",
    "an analogous technique has been used to detect monopole condensation in the ground state of @xmath2 gauge theory@xcite and in @xmath3 gauge theory , as a mechanism for confinement of colour@xcite .    in sect .",
    "2 we shall briefly introduce the model and fix the notation .",
    "we shall also define a creation operator for a vortex .    in sect .",
    "3 we shall present and discuss the results of numerical simulations where the _ vev _ of the above operator is measured .",
    "the result will be a direct detection of the spontaneous breaking of the conservation of the number of vortices in the disordered phase and a direct evidence of vortex condensation .",
    "we shall also obtain an alternative determination of known critical indices , which agrees with existing results , and measure the critical index related to our disorder parameter .",
    "the lattice action of the system is @xmath4 the field variable is the angle @xmath5 in the site @xmath6 : @xmath7 runs from 0 to 2 , 0 being the time axis .    in the limit of zero lattice spacing ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 at high @xmath10",
    "s the system describes a massless free scalar particle .",
    "the couplings of higher dimension appearing in the series expansion of the cosine become important at lower @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition , which is known to be of second order  @xcite .",
    "the system has soliton configurations with the geometry of vortices : numerical simulations show that vortices play an important role in the phase transition@xcite .",
    "a vector field @xmath12 can be defined , and a current @xmath13 associated with it , which is trivially conserved in smooth configurations : @xmath14 because of the antisymmetry of the ricci tensor .",
    "eq([eq : conscurr ] ) is the analog of the bianchi identity in qed .",
    "the constant of the motion is @xmath15 on the other hand from eq.([eq : defa ] ) @xmath16 with @xmath17 any closed path .",
    "a vortex is defined as a configuration for which @xmath18 is non zero .",
    "@xmath19 is an example of such a configuration with @xmath20 .",
    "it has a singularity at @xmath21 .",
    "eq.s ( [ eq : defa]-[eq : number ] ) tell that the number of vortices is a constant of motion , and define a @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "we shall show that , for @xmath22 this symmetry is realized  la wigner : for @xmath23 a spontaneous breaking of it occurs .    to do that we will define an operator which creates a vortex@xcite . in the continuum version of the theory",
    "@xmath24 is the conjugate momentum to the field variable @xmath5 . to add a vortex in the site @xmath25 , @xmath26 to any field configuration the analog of the simple translation @xmath27",
    "can be used .",
    "the translation operator @xmath28\\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] indeed , when applied to the state @xmath29 gives @xmath30 the operator number of vortices @xmath31 has commutation rule with @xmath7 @xmath32 =   \\int{\\rm d}^2z\\,\\vec\\nabla\\wedge\\vec a(\\vec z , t)\\,\\mu(\\vec x , t ) = 2\\pi\\mu(\\vec x , t)\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "if the @xmath2 symmetry which counts the vortices is realized  la wigner , then the ground state must have a definite number of vortices and @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath7 changes the number of vortices a _ vev _ @xmath35 signals their condensation .    the naive translation of eq.([eq:8 ] ) on the lattice",
    "is@xcite @xmath36 \\label{eq:8a}\\ ] ] where the site @xmath37 runs on the sites of a 2 dimensional slice of the lattice at constant @xmath38 , except the position of the vortex .    instead of eq.([eq:8a ] ) we shall use a compactified version of it . by this we mean @xmath39 \\label{eq:8b}\\ ] ] which coincides with eq.([eq:8b ] ) at first order in @xmath40 . with the definition ( [ eq:8b ] )",
    "@xmath41 is independent of the choice of the gauge for @xmath42 , i.e. of the zero for the angle @xmath5 : a redefinition of it is reabsorbed in the integration variable .",
    "two remarks are in order    * in principle one expects @xmath43 in the ordered phase @xmath22 . in fact",
    "@xmath41 is an analytic function of @xmath10 if the number of degrees of freedom is finite , and therefore , if it were zero for @xmath22 it would be identically zero for all @xmath10 s . only in the limit of infinite volume ( thermodynamic limit )",
    "singularities develop , and @xmath41 can be identically zero above @xmath44 , without being zero everywhere .",
    "indeed a simple computation at large @xmath10 s , where the integral is approximately gaussian , gives @xmath45\\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] * due to periodic boundary conditions the total number of vortices must be zero as easily seen from eq.([eq : number ] ) with the boundary @xmath46 at spatial infinity . in principle",
    "then the correct way to determine @xmath47 is to observe a vortex antivortex pair correlation @xmath48 by cluster property and @xmath46 invariance it tends exponentially to @xmath49 at large distances .",
    "+ in practice , since in the thermodynamical limit physics becomes independent of the boundary conditions and decorrelated from them at distances larger than the correlation length , what happens is that also a single vortex can be created , and a direct measurement of @xmath41 can be done .",
    "@xmath41 determined in this way is indeed independent of the boundary conditions within errors .",
    "when a single vortex is put on the lattice by our operator a dislocation appears at the boundary with opposite vorticity to correct for the boundary conditions , and , if the lattice is big compared to the correlation length , what is obtained is the same @xmath49 as with a vortex antivortex pair at large relative distance .",
    "simulations have been done on a @xmath50 and @xmath51 lattices to measure the @xmath52 correlation .",
    "single vortices @xmath41 have also been measured on the same lattices and on @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 lattices .",
    "instead of directly determining @xmath41 as a function of @xmath10 it is more convenient to measure@xcite @xmath56 and to reconstruct @xmath49 as @xmath57\\label{eq : valmu}\\ ] ] the observed shape of @xmath58 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the sharp negative peak at @xmath44 indicates a steep drop of @xmath41 toward zero at @xmath44 . at low @xmath10 s @xmath58",
    "is compatible with 0 and independent of @xmath59 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this means by eq.([eq : valmu ] ) that @xmath60 for @xmath23 , and thus that vortices do condense in the vacuum . at @xmath22 the behaviour of eq.([eq : gaussian ] ) can be checked by numerical calculation of the gaussian integral . for a cubic lattice with a monopole in the center",
    "the result is @xmath61 the comparison with numerical simulations is shown in fig.1 .",
    "eq.([eq : pertrho ] ) means that @xmath49 is exactly zero in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "eq.([eq : pertrho ] ) agrees with the observed values of @xmath58 at large @xmath10 s ( fig.1 ) .    near @xmath44 where the correlation length goes large ,",
    "a finite size analysis can be done to explore the limit of infinite volume and determine the critical index @xmath63 of @xmath7 , @xmath44 , and the critical index @xmath64 of the correlation length .",
    "as @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath67 at finite @xmath68 , @xmath69 as @xmath70 @xmath71 diverges , @xmath72 and the dependence on @xmath73 can be neglected @xmath74 or @xmath75 @xmath76 in the scaling region must be a universal function of @xmath77 .",
    "the quality of this scaling is shown in fig.3 . the critical index @xmath64 and the critical temperature @xmath44 are determined by enforcing this scaling behaviour .",
    "fig.4 shows the data for a vortex antivortex pair at large distance , compared to the single vortex data . in the condensed phase the single vortex behaves in fact as a pair at large distance , confirming that there is no problem in the thermodynamical limit . at @xmath78",
    "the two quantities are different and at @xmath10 sufficiently large are well described by eq.([eq : gaussian ] ) with the different appropriate values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as shown in the figure .",
