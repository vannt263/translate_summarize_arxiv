    "the sine - gordon equation in laboratory coordinates @xmath0 is a model for magnetic flux propagation in long superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , but perhaps may be most easily thought of as the equation describing mechanical vibrations of a `` ribbon '' pendulum ( the continuum limit of a system of linearly arranged co - axial pendula with nearest - neighbor torsion coupling ) .",
    "these and other applications are discussed in detail in the review article @xcite . the correct cauchy problem for this equation involves determining the solution consistent with the given initial data @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are independent of the fixed parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this cauchy problem is globally well - posed @xcite : if @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are functions in @xmath9 then there is a unique solution with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 all lying in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover if the initial data have one more @xmath14 derivative , so that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions in @xmath9 , then this further regularity is preserved as well so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 lie in @xmath13 .",
    "these well - posedness results also hold in a slightly modified form when the initial displacement has nonzero asymptotic values : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 . in this case the topological charge @xmath22 is preserved for all time in the solution @xmath10 .",
    "if suitable initial conditions @xmath6 and @xmath8 are fixed , one may therefore in principle construct the unique global solution @xmath23 of subject to for each positive @xmath4 .",
    "our interest is in the asymptotic behavior of this family of global solutions in the _ semiclassical limit _",
    "the well - known elementary excitations of the sine - gordon equation include solitons of kink ( or antikink ) and breather type ; these have a width proportional to @xmath4 while the length scales in the initial conditions are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that when @xmath25 the initial conditions of the system can be viewed as preparing a `` condensate '' whose ultimate breakup will liberate approximately @xmath26 fundamental particles .",
    "the decay process will take some time to become complete , and during the intermediate stages one may expect that some solitons may partially emerge from the condensate moving with nearly identical velocities , thus forming a modulated wavetrain .",
    "the simplest models for these wavetrains are the periodic ( modulo @xmath27 ) traveling wave exact solutions of of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the _ wavenumber _ and @xmath30 the _ frequency _ of the wavetrain . with this substitution , the sine - gordon equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation that can be integrated once to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an integration constant having the interpretation of _",

    "is used to characterize the kind of motion in which both position and momentum are periodic functions while the term _ rotation _ is used to characterize motions in which momentum is periodic but position is not because the momentum has a nonzero average value .",
    "furthermore , the dichotomy of subluminal waves versus superluminal waves is important because the sine - gordon equation is strictly hyperbolic with characteristic velocities @xmath51 ; thus subluminal waves have phase velocities bounded in magnitude by the characteristic velocity , while superluminal waves move faster than the ( unit ) characteristic speed . in the superluminal ( respectively , subluminal ) case",
    ", the energy value of @xmath52 ( respectively , @xmath53 ) corresponds to the separatrix in the phase portrait of the simple pendulum , at which point the period ( respectively , wavelength ) of the waves tends to infinity . in this limit , each of the four types of wavetrain degenerates into a train of well - separated kink - type solitons ; for rotational waves the kinks all have the same topological charge , while for librational waves the pulses alternate from kink to antikink for zero net charge .    in a body of work beginning with his seminal 1965 paper @xcite",
    ", whitham developed a nonlinear theory of modulated wavetrains .",
    "the main idea in the current context is that one seeks solutions of the sine - gordon equation of the approximate form @xmath54 over space and time intervals of @xmath55 length , where two essential changes are made in the leading term :    1 .   the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 are no longer taken as constant , but are allowed to depend on @xmath56 as long as the appropriate nonlinear dispersion relation is satisfied pointwise , and 2 .",
    "the phase @xmath57 is replaced with a general ( nonlinear ) function of @xmath56 and the local wavenumber and frequency are derived therefrom by the relations @xmath58    by consistency , the definition imposes that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are necessarily linked by @xmath59 an equation that expresses _ conservation of waves_. it then follows that for the error term in to remain @xmath60 formally , one additional partial differential equation on @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 , only two of which are independent due to the nonlinear dispersion relation , is required to hold .",
    "this equation may be derived by many different methods .",
    "perhaps the most direct in this context is to appeal to an averaged variational principle @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon equation is the euler - lagrange equation for the variational principle : @xmath61\\,dx\\,dt = 0 \\;\\implies\\ ; \\epsilon^2u_{tt}-\\epsilon^2u_{xx}+\\sin(u)=0\\ ] ] where the lagrangian density is @xmath62:=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon^2u_t^2 - \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon^2u_x^2-\\cos(u)\\right]\\ ] ] having the interpretation of the difference between kinetic and potential energy densities .",
    "the procedure is to substitute the exact wavetrain into @xmath63 , using the differential equation satisfied by @xmath37 to simplify the resulting expression : @xmath64=\\frac{1}{2 } ( \\omega^2-k^2)u'(\\zeta)^2 + \\cos(u(\\zeta ) ) =   2(\\mathcal{e}+\\cos(u(\\zeta)))-\\mathcal{e},\\ ] ] where for the exact solution @xmath65 .",
    "this expression is periodic in @xmath66 with period @xmath27 , so one may define its period average as @xmath67 an exact expression for @xmath68 is not necessary ; using the differential equation , a shifted version of @xmath37 may be used as the integration variable although the details are slightly different in the four cases ; defining integrals @xmath69 and @xmath70 and noting for future reference that @xmath71 the result is that @xmath72 where @xmath73 distinguishes the superluminal and subluminal cases , and where @xmath74 depending on whether we are considering librational or rotational wavetrains , respectively .",
    "one then substitutes @xmath75 and @xmath76 and formulates the _ averaged variational principle _ : @xmath77 the first of these two equations reproduces in each case the corresponding nonlinear dispersion relation  in the form @xmath78 the second is a first - order partial differential equation : @xmath79 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left[\\frac{\\partial\\langle l\\rangle}{\\partial k}\\right]=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : whithamii}\\ ] ] this equation together with and the nonlinear dispersion relation to eliminate one of the three variables yields a closed system of equations to determine these fields as functions of @xmath56 . from the exposition in @xcite one learns to appreciate the utility of taking @xmath32 and the _ phase velocity _ @xmath80 as the two unknowns , and thus the calculations go as follows . clearly , one has @xmath81 using @xmath82 together with the nonlinear dispersion relation in the form shows that @xmath29 and @xmath30 may be eliminated in favor of @xmath83 and @xmath32 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an arbitrary sign whose role is to select different branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "therefore , the variational modulation equation becomes @xmath86 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left [ \\frac{j(\\mathcal{e})}{\\sqrt{|v_\\mathrm{p}^2 - 1|}}\\right]=0\\ ] ] and the conservation of waves equation becomes @xmath87 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left[\\frac{v_\\mathrm{p}}{j'(\\mathcal{e})\\sqrt{|v_\\mathrm{p}^2 - 1|}}\\right]=0\\ ] ] ( the sign @xmath85 drops out in each case ) .",
    "an application of the chain rule puts the system in the form @xmath88 &   ( 1-v_\\mathrm{p}^2)^2j'(\\mathcal{e})j''(\\mathcal{e})\\\\ -j(\\mathcal{e})j'(\\mathcal{e } ) &   v_\\mathrm{p}[j(\\mathcal{e})j''(\\mathcal{e})+j'(\\mathcal{e})^2]\\end{bmatrix } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\begin{bmatrix } v_\\mathrm{p}\\\\ \\mathcal{e}\\end{bmatrix}= \\mathbf{0 } \\label{eq : whithamsystem_general}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 thus the dependence on the sign @xmath90 also disappears except from within the definition of @xmath91 .",
    "actually , this system as written has an apparent singularity if @xmath83 blows up as can happen in the superluminal cases when the wavenumber @xmath29 vanishes . in these cases",
    "it is better to introduce the _ reciprocal phase velocity _ @xmath92 and then in the overlap region where neither @xmath83 nor @xmath93 vanishes , takes the form @xmath94 & -(1-n_p^2)^2j'(\\mathcal{e})j''(\\mathcal{e})\\\\ j(\\mathcal{e})j'(\\mathcal{e } ) & n_\\mathrm{p } [ j(\\mathcal{e})j''(\\mathcal{e})+j'(\\mathcal{e})^2 ] \\end{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\begin{bmatrix}n_\\mathrm{p}\\\\\\mathcal{e}\\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{0 }",

    "the whitham modulation theory has been generalized to handle modulated _ multiphase _",
    "waves @xcite having any number of @xmath27-periodic phase variables ; however the full implications of the resulting modulation equations generalizing have apparently only been understood for waves with a maximum of two phases .",
    "the whitham modulation theory makes predictions of so - called `` modulational stability '' of wavetrains on the basis of whether the quasilinear system of modulation equations is hyperbolic ( modulationally stable ) or elliptic ( modulationally unstable ) .",
    "one should think of modulational stability as linear ( neutral ) stability of perturbations to the wavetrain that have similar characteristic wavelengths and periods to the unperturbed exact wavetrain solution .",
    "thus , hyperbolicity of the modulation equations suggests the absence of a `` slow '' sideband instability , but does not necessarily rule out instabilities to perturbations with wavenumbers far from the unperturbed wavenumber @xmath29 or even sideband instabilities with exponential growth rates that are far from the unperturbed frequency @xmath30 . among the candidate wavetrain types for stability of the linearized equation @xmath106 ( in the sense of a @xmath107 estimate on @xmath108 and @xmath109 that depends on initial data but is independent of @xmath110 )",
    "there are thus only the subluminal and superluminal rotational wavetrains .",
    "it is not difficult to believe that the superluminal rotational wavetrains are linearly unstable , since in the limiting case of @xmath111 and @xmath112 one obtains an orbit homoclinic to the exact constant solution @xmath113 , @xmath114 which is obviously unstable to small spatially constant perturbations . indeed ,",
    "such perturbations cause all of the vertical pendula to `` drop '' simultaneously ; the growth rate of the perturbation is clearly large compared to the zero frequency of the unperturbed solution explaining why the instability is not captured by whitham theory . the definitive statement in the literature",
    "@xcite is that the subluminal rotational wavetrains are indeed linearly stable ( and the only stable type among the four types of traveling waves ) , although we have not been able to verify the line of argument in all details ( it is not clear to us from the proof that the stable solutions obtained in the case of subluminal rotational wavetrains form a basis of @xmath107 , or that the exponentially growing solutions obtained in the other three cases are relevant as they appear to be unbounded in @xmath100 ) .    in this paper",

    "we will show that for a general class of `` pure impulse '' initial data , most of the real @xmath100-axis is occupied for small time ( independent of @xmath4 ) by modulated superluminal wavetrains of either rotational or librational types .",
    "this result shows the relevance of the whitham modulation theory even in some cases when it results in elliptic modulation equations .",
    "( in a forthcoming paper @xcite we will show that the remaining part of the @xmath100-axis is occupied by more complicated oscillations that nonetheless have a certain universal form for @xmath110 small . )",

    "_ analysis of the cauchy problem for posed with initial data may be carried out in some detail by means of the inverse scattering transform based on the differential equation , the so - called faddeev - takhtajan eigenvalue problem .",
    "a self - contained account of this analysis can be found in our paper @xcite , where the spectral parameter @xmath119 is used ; the utility of @xmath120 is related to an even symmetry of the spectrum in the @xmath121-plane .    by _ pure impulse _",
    "initial data we simply mean data for which the initial displacement @xmath2 vanishes identically .",
    "an elementary observation is that if @xmath122 , then for @xmath123 the faddeev - takhtajan eigenvalue problem reduces to the zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem : @xmath124 this is the eigenvalue problem in the lax pair for the sine - gordon equation in characteristic coordinates and the cubic focusing nonlinear schrdinger equations .",

    "it is easy to see that for real @xmath128 the discrete spectrum comes in quartets symmetric with respect to the involutions @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , klaus and shaw @xcite have proved that if @xmath131 is real , of one sign , and has a single critical point ( so that the graph of @xmath132 is `` bell - shaped '' ) , then the discrete spectrum is purely imaginary and nondegenerate .    in the context of pure impulse",
    "initial data for which @xmath8 is a nonpositive ( without loss of generality ) function of klaus - shaw type , the necessarily purely imaginary eigenvalues @xmath133 may be approximated by a formal wkb method applicable when @xmath25 .",
    "the result of this analysis is that with the klaus - shaw function @xmath3 one associates the wkb phase integral @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the two roots of @xmath136 when @xmath133 is as indicated .",
    "then one defines approximate eigenvalues @xmath137 by the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule @xmath138 where the asymptotic number of eigenvalues on the positive imaginary axis is @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the standard @xmath141 norm . to each simple eigenvalue @xmath133 of the zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem",
    "there corresponds a _ proportionality constant _",
    "@xmath142 relating the solution having normalized decaying asymptotics as @xmath143 with the solution having normalized decaying asymptotics as @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath8 is a real even function of @xmath100 , then one can show by symmetry that @xmath145 , and wkb theory for klaus - shaw potentials suggests that the proportionality constants alternate in sign along the imaginary axis .",
    "thus for even @xmath8 , to the approximate eigenvalue @xmath146 we associate the approximate proportionality constant @xmath147 given by @xmath148 the final ingredient of the scattering data for @xmath8 in the zakharov - shabat problem is the reflection coefficient defined for real @xmath133 . according to the wkb approximation , the reflection coefficient is small pointwise for @xmath149 when @xmath25 .    in this paper , we study even , pure impulse initial data of klaus - shaw type for the sine - gordon equation .",

    "the solution is : @xmath171 for example , the function @xmath172 clearly satisfies the analyticity and positivity conditions on @xmath170 listed in assumption  [ assume : h ] , and in this case the integral in can be evaluated in terms of elementary functions and the resulting function @xmath173 can be inverted to yield @xmath174 perhaps the simplest example of an admissible initial condition .",
