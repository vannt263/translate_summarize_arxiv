    "typical mass or initial mass function of population iii stars are fundamental parameters that have great impacts on subsequent structure formation of the universe .",
    "those stars are expected to be as massive as @xmath0 , which ionize / dissociate the surrounding media . as a result ,",
    "star formation activities in the neighbourhood of the stars are highly regulated ( e.g. @xcite and the references are therein ) .",
    "there are two chief reasons that the population iii stars are expected to be very massive .",
    "first one comes from numerical studies by several authors @xcite .",
    "those studies reveal that the prestellar cores formed as fragments of primordial gas are as massive as @xmath1 .",
    "second ground is the very high accretion rates of those stars , which is as high as @xmath2 .",
    "these two facts are the direct consequence of relatively high temperature ( @xmath3k ) of primordial gas because of inefficient cooling by h@xmath4 .    on the other hand",
    ", abundance pattern of the hyper metal - poor stars seems to be more consistent with that of `` faint '' supernovae as remnants of less massive ( @xmath5 ) population iii stars@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies suggest the possibilities for the formation of such less massive population iii stars .",
    "if the primordial gas was once ionized , enhanced fraction of h@xmath4 causes more efficient cooling and hd formation . since hd molecules have lower excitation energy than that of h@xmath4 , gas can be cooled below 100k . as a result",
    ", the mass of the fragments could be smaller than @xmath6@xcite .",
    "@xcite also demonstrates that such low mass population iii stars cloud be formed directly from the cosmological density fluctuations .",
    "those new ideas are quite interesting and promising , however , we still do not know the actual mass of population iii stars formed from @xmath7 prestellar cores , which are commonly found in cosmological simulations .",
    "since they are only @xmath8 , we have to follow the subsequent evolution of the collapsing cloud .",
    "further evolution of prestellar cores is first investigated by @xcite , and they found that the collapse proceeds in a run - away fashion and converges to larson - penston type similarity solution @xcite with polytropic index @xmath9 .",
    "they also find the mass accretion rate is very large compared to the present - day forming stars , although spherical symmetry is assumed in their radiation hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed cosmological simulations in which the run - away collapsing core is traced up to a very dense regime ( @xmath10 ) , taking the sobolev type line transfer approximations .",
    "they also find basically consistent results in 3d cosmological simulations with previous 1d results by @xcite .",
    "however , most of the mass of protostar is accumulated in the accretion phase , which has not been traced especially in multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "recent numerical simulations performed by @xcite show that disks would be formed at the center of collapsing primordial clouds , which might result in the disks surrounding the protostars , or binaries .",
    "thus , the actual mass of a population iii star should depends on the mechanism of the angular momentum transport in the accretion disk .",
    "there are a few possibilities of the angular momentum transport mechanism such as gravitational torque by the nonaxisymmetric structures in the accretion disk , the interaction among the fragments of the disk @xcite , and the turbulent viscosity triggered by magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite . as for",
    "mri induced turbulence , the strength of magnetic field in the disk is the key quantity to activate the instability@xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that recent mhd simulations by @xcite suggests the possibility of bipolar jets from proto - population iii stars , which also could suppress the mass accretion onto the central core .",
    "the formation of jets also requires the presence of some level of magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is quite important to assess the magnetic field strength brought into the accretion disk from initial weak cosmological seed field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite investigated this issue by solving detailed chemical reaction rate equations coupled with energy equation in run - away collapsing core .",
    "they found that magnetic field is always frozen to the collapsing core in case the strength of initial magnetic field is smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "this is comparable to the maximal strength of magnetic field which allow the clouds to collapse .",
    "therefore they conclude magnetic field is always frozen to the _ collapsing _ cloud in the run - away collapsing core .",
    "they also evaluate the minimal strength of magnetic field which is required to activate mri assuming magnetic field is frozen to the gas not only in the run - away phase , but also in the accretion phase .",
    "this assumption is based upon the argument that the temperature of the accretion flow would rise faster than that of the core , because of the shock heating . as a result",
    ", the ionization degree is expected to be higher than those in run - away phase , which guarantee the gas to be frozen to the magnetic field lines . however",
    ", such heating is only important in the final phase of accretion , where the flow settle onto the accretion disk . in order to investigate the coupling of matter and magnetic field in the accretion phase",
    ", we need to calculate the actual thermal and chemical evolution of accretion flow . aside from the issue on ionization degree ,",
    "the ambipolar diffusion velocity is proportional to the square inverse of density ( @xmath12 ) . as a result , the diffusion velocity increases rapidly in the mass accretion phase , since the density at a fixed radius decreases as the accretion proceeds .",
    "thus , we need a detailed treatment to test the coupling between the gas and magnetic field in accretion phase .    in this paper , we investigate the dissipation of magnetic field in collapsing primordial gas cloud from run - away phase to accretion phase , by solving detailed thermal and chemical rate equations . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the formulations employed . in  [ results ] , results of our calculations are shown .",
    "the formation of jets and activation of mri is discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "final section is devoted to summary .",
    "in order to evaluate the coupling of the gas and the magnetic field , we need to assess the amount of ions and electrons in collapsing primordial cloud . the collapse of the cloud is expected to proceed in run - away fashion ( run - away phase ) in the beginning , followed by the mass accretion phase after the formation of rotationally supported disk at the center . in this paper , we follow the chemical and thermal evolution of the materials to form star , throughout the two phases .",
    "we assume spherically symmetric collapse of the progenitor gas , although we expect the formation of rotationally supported disk in the very dense regime ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is also assumed that the magnetic field is so weak that the dynamics of the collapsing gas is not affected by the magnetic force .",
    "the run - away collapse phase is traced by solving 1-dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "the equation of continuity is @xmath14 whereas the equation of motion is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass within radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the density of the cloud , @xmath19 is the velocity and @xmath20 is the pressure . since the equation of state of collapsing primordial gas in run - away phase",
    "is known to be approximated by polytrope with @xmath21 @xcite , we employ following equation : @xmath22 we solve above set of equations by spherically symmetric lagrangian hydrodynamics code developed by ourselves , following the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) described in @xcite .      the dynamics of accretion phase could be approximated by simple free - fall , since the flow velocity is supersonic .",
    "basic equations of free - falling accretion flow consists of the equation of continuity and the equation of motion : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the position of fluid element , time , and the time when the mass accretion starts , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the mass within @xmath28 at @xmath29 : @xmath30 the initial radius @xmath28 is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the the solution of above equation of motion is given as @xmath32 .",
    "the velocity of the fluid element is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total energy defined as @xmath35 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : continuity at accretion phase ] ) , the density at @xmath36 is given as @xmath37 @xmath38 is the partial differentiation by @xmath28 keeping @xmath25 fixed .",
    "an explicit expression of this term is given in appendix [ appendix_a ] . in order to clarify the validity of the free - fall approximation , it is compared with the similarity solution with @xmath21 @xcite in accretion phase .",
    "the initial condition of the accretion flow is set as the final state of the run - away collapse with @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : free - fall v.s .",
    "polytrope ] illustrates the density and velocity distributions of several snapshots .",
    "it is obvious that the free - fall approximation can describe the matter distribution in accretion phase very well for polytropic gas . in other words ,",
    "the thermal evolution has little effects on the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "thus , the dynamics can be approximated by free - fall formula , irrespective of the internal energy equation .",
    "( 13cm,10cm)fig1.eps    in the accretion flow , the effective polytropic index is basically unknown .",
    "thus , we have to solve the following energy equation for each fluid element : @xmath39 in this expression , @xmath20 denotes the pressure , which is related to the internal energy @xmath40 by the equation of state : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the adiabatic exponent , @xmath43 denotes the net energy loss rate per unit mass .",
    "we take into account the rovibrational line cooling by @xmath44(@xmath45 ) , the continuum radiation from the gas ( @xmath46 ) , and cooling and heating associated with chemical reactions ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xmath49 is the sum of all these contributions .",
    "the cooling rate by the rovibrational transition of hydrogen molecules are assessed by the fitting formula given by @xcite in case the lines are optically thin . in the optically thick regime ,",
    "we employ the escape probability formalism , as described in equations ( 12)-(15 ) in @xcite , except that we use actual velocity gradient in our calculations .",

    "this formula is valid in case the accreting gas is optically thin for continuum radiation .",
    "we confirmed that the optical depth is smaller than unity throughout the accretion phase .",

    "the run - away phase and the subsequent accretion phase have to be treated in different formulation from each other as described in subsections [ runaway ] and [ accretionphase ] .",

    "it is clear that the density for @xmath141 decreases as the collapse proceeds , which is basically the same feature found in similarity solution of polytropic cloud in accretion phase .",

    "its dependence on various physical quantities are described as @xmath142 ( see equations ( [ eq : diffusion_velocity])-([eq : a2 ] ) ) . on the other hand , the accretion velocity scales as @xmath143 for @xmath141 . since we consider the accretion phase starting from the final phase of run - away collapse with @xmath21 , the density profile and the central mass in accretion phase also depend on @xmath144 .",

    "<S> we investigate the dissipation of magnetic flux in primordial star - forming clouds throughout their collapse including the run - away collapse phase as well as the accretion phase . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the energy equation and the non - equilibrium chemical reactions in the collapsing gas , in order to obtain the radial distribution of the ionized fraction during the collapse . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find the ionized fraction is high enough for the magnetic field to couple with the gas throughout the evolution of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the jet formation from protostars as well as the activation of magneto - rotational instability in the accretion disk are enabled in the presence of the cosmological seed magnetic flux proposed by @xcite . </S>"
