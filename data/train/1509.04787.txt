    "cu@xmath0o ( cuprous oxide ) is a p - type semiconductor that has recently attracted the attention of experimental and theoretical groups due to its potential for application in metal base transistors  @xcite , spintronic  @xcite , photocathode for water splitting  @xcite , electrochemical supercapacitors  @xcite and catalysts  @xcite , and for light harvesting  @xcite .",
    "the deposition of cu@xmath0o layers has been achieved by different techniques , such as pulsed laser deposition  @xcite , magnetron sputtering  @xcite , copper oxidation  @xcite , radical oxidation  @xcite , and electrodeposition  @xcite .",
    "electrodeposition is a very versatile technique , allowing to modify many structural , optical , and electrical properties by the control of the deposition parameters  @xcite .",
    "moreover , electrodeposition appears as a cost effective method to the preparation of metal and semiconductor thin films for device applications . when compared with physical deposition processes , such as sputtering , electrodeposition has the particular feature of diffusive mass transport of species from the electrolyte to the growing surface  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical growth mechanisms , taking into account the mass transport at the electrode surface , plays a vital role to the production of films with the desired properties .",
    "one example is the technological requirement for mesoscopic layers to be used in photocathode applications , in which the grain shape and the exposed crystalline faces need to be controlled to improve stability and efficiency  @xcite . on the other hand , the study of surface topography of deposited layers helps to discriminate the basic mechanisms of growth dynamics from the particular features of each set of physico - chemical deposition conditions  @xcite",
    ". a crucial condition may be the substrate , which affects the early stages of island formation and growth and , possibly , the subsequent film dynamics .",
    "bearing in mind the above mentioned arguments , the present work aims to investigate the structure of electrochemically grown cu@xmath0o films on top of a semiconducting and monocrystalline substrate and on top of a metallic and polycrystalline substrate , viz .",
    "n - si(100 ) and ni evaporated on n - si(100 ) .",
    "recently , our group showed that these two substrates are suitable for morphological , structural and optical studies on cu@xmath0o  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cu@xmath0o / ni structure may be employed on photochemical  @xcite and spin transport  @xcite investigations .",
    "raman spectroscopy , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) measurements are carried out to characterize film composition and structure .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) images are used to study kinetic roughening of the film surface , thus helping to disclose the main mechanisms of the growth dynamics .",
    "films directly grown on the semiconductor substrate have a v shape columnar structure , preferential growth in @xmath2 $ ] direction , and show anomalous roughening , while those grown on the ni layer present an u shape columnar structure , change the dominant crystallographic orientation during the growth , and have normal roughening .",
    "a deeper analysis of surface morphology shows that the dominant mechanism in the cu@xmath0o growth is surface diffusion of adsorbed molecules , with uniform incoming flux .",
    "step edge energy barriers explain the anomaly of the former films , connecting this feature to the grain shape .",
    "the universal coarse - grained growth dynamics is similar to what is observed in many vapor deposited films , despite the relevance of electrochemical conditions to local reaction and adsorption processes . on the other hand , the interaction between the film and the substrate , which is frequently restricted to island nucleation and growth , here",
    "is shown to have drastic consequences to the structure of the thickest cu@xmath0o films .",

    "cu@xmath0o films were deposited on ( 100 ) monocrystalline n - type silicon ( resistivities in the range of 6 - 9 @xmath3 cm ) without and with a cap layer of 50 nm of evaporated ni . before cu@xmath0o electrodeposition or ni deposition , the silicon substrates were immersed in hf 5% for 20s to remove silicon native oxide from the surface .",
    "the roughnesses of the n - si substrate and of the ni layer surface are respectively @xmath4 nm and @xmath5 nm . ni thin films deposited on si(100 ) had preferential growth in the @xmath6 $ ] direction , which was checked by xrd measurements .",

    "the deposits were obtained via potentiostatic experiments .",
    "samples were deposited at 25   for a deposition potential of @xmath12 v _ vs _ sce , where the only varied parameter was the thickness @xmath13 of the samples for the 2 different substrates , n - si(100 ) and ni / n - si(100 ) .",
    "the efficiency of the cu@xmath0o electrodeposition process was checked by rutherford backscattering in a previous work and values of 90% were obtained  @xcite .",

    "we have concluded that for @xmath19 image size the @xmath15 reaches the saturation value .",
    "in addition , before starting measurements on cu@xmath0o samples , the performance of the afm tip was checked by imaging au thin films with known surface .",
    "the copper oxide phase formed in the electrodeposited thin films was analyzed by raman spectroscopy and xrd .",

    "[ fig1]b , probably due to the higher surface sensitivity of raman measurements . cu@xmath8o@xmath21 and cuo phases are likely to be formed by oxidation of cu@xmath0o top layers",

    "cu@xmath0o / n - si(100 ) samples display strong preferential growth in @xmath2 $ ] direction , following the orientation of the substrate .",
    "on the other hand , cu@xmath0o film grown on top of ni / n - si(100 ) substrate is composed by grains oriented in @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath6 $ ] , and @xmath23 $ ] directions .",
    "the evolution of cu@xmath0o growth on ni / n - si(100 ) is explained by ref . @xcite",
    "as follows : ( _ i _ ) the cu@xmath0o films show initial @xmath6 $ ] growth due to a better coupling of the cu@xmath0o(111)/ni(111 ) interface compared to the cu@xmath0o(100)/ni(111 ) one ; ( _ ii _ ) at electrolyte ph of @xmath10 the @xmath2 $ ] growth is favored , the initial @xmath6 $ ] growth starts to be suppressed by the @xmath2 $ ] one and at a specific thickness a major part of the cu@xmath0o deposit will be composed by @xmath2 $ ] grains .",
    "these growth steps are confirmed by the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , which shows the fraction of the material growing in @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] directions as a function of film thickness for both substrates .",

    "the initial growth of cu@xmath0o on ni(111 ) is thermodynamically controlled by the cu@xmath0o(111)/ni(111 ) coupling , likewise as previously reported for cu@xmath0o(111)/au(111 ) and cu@xmath0o(100)/au(100 ) interfaces  @xcite .",

    "a common feature in both substrates is that the film surface presents a granular aspect . in films deposited on n - si",
    ", there is a remarkable increase of the grain size from the thinnest to the thickest film .",
    "the columnar structure with v shape shown in tem images and this increase in grain size suggest a coarsening process , with part of the initial columns growing and enlarging up to 1500 nm at the expenses of neighboring ones . on the other hand ,",

    "deviations for the thinner samples ( 25 to 75 nm ) are characteristic of the initial island growth and coalescence , indicating that an extended film is formed between 75 nm and 150 nm of thickness . for this reason , only results for @xmath33 nm will be analyzed below .",
    "on the other hand , the oxide layers grown on n - si have anomalous scaling , since the roughness in small boxes shift to larger values with increasing thicknesses  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a single dominant orientation during the growth ( shown by xrd ) and the coarsening of growing columns from the smallest to the largest thicknesses ( suggested by tem and afm images ) indicate that the scaling anomaly is an intrinsic feature of the surface dynamics in this system .    the data presented in fig .",

    "this is consistent with normal scaling .",
    "comparison of local slope distributions with those of theoretical models is not possible because there are significant thickness effects and the present concept of local slope differs from the definitions in integrated growth equations or in lattice models .",
    "the mh scaling was formerly observed in electrochemically deposited prussian blue films  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the anomalous roughening was generated by time increasing adsorption rates .",
    "the exact solution of the mh equation  @xcite allows an extension of the interpretation of the experimental data , particularly those of films grown on n - si substrates .    the mh roughness @xmath15 is expected to scale similarly to the height - height correlation function ; in terms of box size @xmath28 and time @xmath57 we have  @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a scaling function [ @xmath101 for small @xmath102 and @xmath103 recall that @xmath13 is proportional to the time @xmath57 .    the long time ( large thickness ) scaling of the correlation length gives exponent @xmath104 near the mh value ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "figure [ fig9 ] shows @xmath110 versus @xmath13 for both films . the approximately constant value of @xmath111 for the films grown on ni / n - si indicates that @xmath76 is also time - independent in that case .",
    "however , the scaling in films grown on n - si and the time - independence of @xmath74 gives @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath76 is the amplitude of time and spatial fluctuations of deposition rate , this means that those fluctuations increase in time in the films grown on n - si .",
    "this leads to the anomalous scaling in those films .     as a function of the thickness @xmath13 for films grown on n - si ( triangles ) and on ni / n - si ( squares )",
    "the solid line , with slope @xmath113 , is a least squares fit of the large thickness data for films grown on n - si.,width=302 ]    the above increase of @xmath76 is sufficiently slow , thus the original solution of the mh equation can be consistently used with the time - dependent form of that parameter  @xcite .",
    "this feature was already illustrated in other continuous and lattice models with time dependent couplings  @xcite showing anomalous scaling .",
    "the scaling of distributions of local heights , maximal heights , and roughness provide strong evidence that the roughening in electrodeposited cu@xmath0o films is governed by the mh equation ( [ eqmh ] ) .",
    "the noise amplitude increases in time in the equation associated to the films grown on n - si substrates , corresponding to the scaling anomaly .",
    "this analysis clearly advance over the calculation of scaling exponents , which however are also compatible with the mh ones .",
    "the mh equation was proposed for roughening in molecular beam epitaxy  @xcite , in which a crystalline film slowly grows by random adsorption of atoms / molecules from vapor and surface adatoms diffuse and preferentially bind to high coordination ( low energy ) sites .",
    "thus , in the electrochemical deposition of cu@xmath0o films , those results indicate that this interplay of surface diffusion and deposition noise is also the main ingredient for roughening under the present growth conditions .",
    "the mh equation considers that adsorption rates are spatially uniform and do not depend on time .",
    "this suggests that electrochemical conditions do not determine the main dynamic mechanisms for roughening , although they probably affect the values of the parameters in the associated mh equation .",
    "since the same electrochemical conditions were used for growth of films on both substrates , we are led to the conclusion that their different structures are consequence of the substrate - film interaction .",
    "the different interactions in different substrates determine the island nucleation and growth and has consequences in the thickest films , despite the universal mh dynamics      in systems with diffusion - dominated dynamics , molecules at a surface grain randomly move , with rates depending on local energy barriers . at first approximation ,",
    "those barriers depend on coordination numbers and increase at step edges . for an adatom or ad - molecule to go down a step",
    ", the additional activation energy , known as ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) barrier  @xcite , reduces the downward flux near the step edge , favoring nucleation of new atomic terraces over the ones previously formed  @xcite .",
    "the effect of es barriers is enhanced at grain boundaries , constraining the mass flux between the grains if height differences are large .",
    "these features are observed in films of several materials grown by vapor methods .",
    "the above results strongly suggest to extend this interpretation to cu@xmath0o electrodeposition .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows that films grown on n - si substrates have an initially small average grain size , but with a broad size distribution .",
    "this is confirmed quantitatively by the small values of the correlation length in fig .",
    "[ fig5]d ( @xmath114 nm in @xmath115 nm thick films ) .",
    "thus , the islands nucleating at that substrate also had large size fluctuations",
    ". this may be a consequence of large spatial fluctuations of the adsorption rate during the first stages of the growth .",
    "when an extended film is formed , the local adsorption rates may become uniform , particularly if the dominant crystallographic orientation does not change , as shown in sec .",
    "[ rescharact ] ; see also inset of fig .",
    "however , larger grains have larger numbers of terraces and steps , consequently the mass flux from their tops to their boundaries is small . with restricted mass exchange in grain boundaries , the large grains increase in width and",
    "cover the smaller ones . from a coarse grained point of view",
    ", the fluctuations in the adsorption rate continue to increase , which qualitatively explains the time increase of the parameter @xmath76 in the corresponding hydrodynamic model ( the mh equation ) .",
    "figure [ fig8]e shows that the shape of the slope distribution is the same while its average value moves to the right during the film growth .",
    "this means that local slopes increase inside the grains and at their boundaries , consistently with the above interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig3]c shows that films grown on ni / n - si substrates have larger initial grains with a much narrower size distribution ( see also insets of figs .",
    "[ fig5]d and [ fig5]f ) .",
    "this is related to small fluctuations in local adsorption rates , a feature that is maintained during the growth and leads to normal roughening .",
    "afm images also reveal that the grain top surfaces are similar in the films grown in both substrates , thus the local ( microscopic ) adsorption rates at those surfaces are expected to be the same . in growth on n - si substrates , the difference in the net growth rate of individual grains have to be explained by the restricted mass flux across grain boundaries , not by intra - grain features .",
    "if some grains with large slopes are initially formed , they may grow faster at the expenses of the neighboring ones .",
    "this establishes a connection between the v - shaped grains and the anomalous roughening .",
    "unusual scaling features are frequently found in diffusion - dominated growth in the presence of step energy barriers  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a small barrier in fe / fe(100 ) epitaxy leads to mound formation at the film surface , with skewed height distribution and @xmath116  @xcite , which are characteristics of the non - linear molecular beam epitaxy equation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , mound steepening in ag / ag(100 ) epitaxy at room temperature occurs with an effective exponent @xmath52 much larger than @xmath117 in thicknesses ranging from 100 to 1000 monolayers  @xcite ( @xmath118 is a feature of completely uncorrelated growth  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that , although control of electrochemical conditions is essential to enable growth of cu@xmath0o films and to determine the crystallographic orientation , our results show that large scale surface features are determined by physical properties of the material and the substrate , with consequences on the internal film structure .",
    "roughening is governed by the interplay of deposition and ad - species surface diffusion , similarly to vapor deposition , with no significant influence of inhomogeneous mass flux from the solution ( if it exists ) .",
    "however , substrate - film interactions have a strong effect on island nucleation and growth , thus the structure of the tickest films is drastically affected by these initial conditions , despite the universal ( mh ) roughening dynamics .",
