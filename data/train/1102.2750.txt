    "the reciprocity relation [ 2,3 ] , @xmath6 , also known as reciprocity law or reciprocity theorem , which links the luminosity distance @xmath2 with the angular diameter distance @xmath1 at redshift z , is a fundamental result for astronomical observations in cosmology .",
    "it is extensively used in various domains ranging from gravitational lensing studies to analyses of the cosmic microwave black body radiation observations , as well as for galaxy and galaxy cluster observations [ 4 - 22 ] .    as is known to everyone ,",
    "one fundamental hypothesis in general relativity is that light travels along null geodesics in a riemannian spacetime ( see [ 23 ] for instance ) , based on which the reciprocity law is generally established . actually , the reciprocity relation is also valid for other cosmological models based on riemannian geometry besides the flrw cosmology .",
    "the only condition is that sources and observers are connected by null geodesics in a general riemannian spacetime . up to now",
    ", diverse astrophysical mechanisms such as gravitational lensing and dust extinction have been proved to be capable of causing obvious deviation from the distance duality [ 24 ] and testing this equality with high accuracy can also provide a powerful probe of exotic physics [ 25 ] .",
    "therefore , the verification of the observational validity of the reciprocity law is , perhaps , one of the major challenging open problems in modern cosmology . due to this",
    ", many previous works have been done regarding some attempts to test the identity with diverse model parameterizations of @xmath3 [ 25 - 27 ] . in this paper , we assume that the reciprocity relation can be a constant or a function of the redshift , namely :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 denotes a constant around the standard case ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 quantifies a possible time - dependent departing from the standard result ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "for instance , bassett & kunz ( 2004 ) [ 25 ] used current supernovae ia data as a measurement of the luminosity distance @xmath12 , and estimated @xmath13 from friib radio galaxies [ 28 ] and ultra compact radio sources [ 9,29,30 ] to detect possible new physics .",
    "meanwhile , observations from sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and x - ray surface brightness from galaxy clusters may also provide us a test for the distance duality relation . in order to quantify the @xmath3 parameter , uzan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) [ 26 ] fixed @xmath1 by using the cosmic concordance @xmath14cdm model [ 31 ] with @xmath15 from 18 galaxy clusters [ 32 ] .",
    "they got @xmath16",
    "( 1@xmath17 ) by assuming @xmath3 a constant .",
    "more recently , de bernardis et al . (",
    "2006 ) [ 33 ] have also carried out semblable works using the angular diameter distances from 38 galaxy clusters provided by the sample of ref . [",
    "34 ] , and they obtained @xmath18 at @xmath19 in the context of @xmath14cdm model .",
    "more recently , holanda et al . (",
    "2010 ) [ 27 ] used the reciprocity relation to show how one may assess the cluster geometry by using the constraint provided by the reciprocity relation , with the final result that the elliptical geometry for clusters as advocated by de filippis et al .",
    "is more favorable .    in this paper , instead of testing the reciprocity relation , we take it for granted in order to show how we may assess the cluster temperature profiles by using the constraint provided by the reciprocity relation .",
    "a robust method is that we could obtain the observational @xmath10 at redshift @xmath20 from the cluster gas mass fraction , @xmath21 , which could be inferred from x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies .",
    "notice that the presence of temperature profiles plays an essential part in the determination of measured total mass , the fraction of mass in stars and , hence , the gas fraction .",
    "in this context , with two groups of cluster gas mass fraction data from the chandra satellite [ 1 ] , we test the influence on the distance duality relation when different assumptions about the cluster temperature profiles are considered .",
    "our analysis here will be based on two parametric representations defined by eq.([rec ] ) , namely : i. @xmath22 ; ii .",
    "the first expression is on the assumption that @xmath3 does not evolve with redshifts while the second is a continuous and smooth linear one - parameter expansion .",
    "obviously , the above parameterizations are inspired by similar expressions for @xmath24-the equation of state in the constant @xmath25 and time - varying dark energy models ( see ref.[17,35,36 ] ) .",
    "more importantly , for our subsequent analysis , concerning a given data set , the likelihood of @xmath8 or @xmath26 must be peaked ( or @xmath27 minimizes equivalently ) at @xmath9 or @xmath28 in order to satisfy the etherington theorem . as we shall see , assuming the strict validity of the reciprocity theorem , our analysis indicates that the constant temperature assumption tends to be more compatible with no violation of the reciprocity relation . in principle , this kind of result is an interesting example of how a cosmological condition correlates to the local physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ] we present two samples of cluster gas mass fraction data from 52 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters obtained by chandra .",
    "we then briefly describe the analysis method and show the results of constraining parameters including @xmath8 and @xmath26 in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to constrain the possible values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we consider two samples of cluster gas mass fraction data from 52 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters obtained by chandra in the redshift range @xmath4 and temperature range @xmath31 kev , one of which is estimated by assuming a constant temperature equal to @xmath32 [ 1 ] , while the other is on the hypothesis of a different temperature profile which reproduces well the temperature gradients in nearby relaxed systems [ 37 ] : @xmath33^{0.45 } } , \\label{eq : tr}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , ettori et al .",
    "( 2009 ) [ 1 ] found this temperature profile might increase @xmath35 by about 16 percent with respect to the estimates obtained under the assumption of isothermality . because of this , in the following analysis , we make use of the gas mass fraction data obtained with different temperature profiles to limit parameters .",
    "we recall here that in the overall sample of 52 objects at @xmath36 , @xmath37 is assumed , which is also used in the computations throughout this paper .    .",
    "the open blue diamonds and red circles with the associated error bars stand , respectively , for the constant and vikhlinin et al . temperature profile samples .",

    "1 we plot two samples of cluster gas fraction data from 52 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters obtained in the redshift range @xmath4 [ 1 ] , which were also used as a proxy for the cosmological parameters such as @xmath38 and @xmath25 [ 1 ] . however , since these samples are endowed with different temperature profile assumptions , our major interest here is to confront these underlying hypotheses with the validity of the reciprocity relation .",
    "thereafter , our attention is paid to the process of extracting @xmath3 from the gas mass fraction .",
    "as is well known , old , relaxed , rich galaxy clusters should provide us with a characteristic sample of the matter content of the universe if they are large enough .",
    "moreover , the baryonic fraction @xmath39 , should remain the same during cosmic evolution if the baryonic - to - total mass ratio in clusters is equal to the cosmological baryonic mass fraction ratio @xmath40 .",
    "since clusters are observed at different redshifts and the reconstructed @xmath39 depends on the assumed distance to the cluster , this data can be used to constrain @xmath3 . following allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) [ 38 ] , we compute the gas mass fraction given by    @xmath41    where five parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) are related to modeling the cluster gas mass fraction .",

    "this `` bias '' factor was modeled as @xmath47 with the uniform priors @xmath48 and @xmath49 suggested by cosmological simulations [ 38 ] .",

    "the parameter @xmath52 denotes the baryon gas mass fraction in stars .",
    "allen et al . (",
    "2008 ) [ 38 ] modeled it as @xmath53 , using the uniform prior @xmath54 as well as the gaussian prior @xmath55 .",
    "however , recent works found that an additional intracluster light ( icl ) at very low surface brightness might also contribute to the total cold baryonic content of galaxy clusters : @xmath56 [ 40,41 ] .",
    "more recently , lagana et al .",
    "( 2008 ) [ 42 ] discussed in detail the baryonic content of five massive galaxy clusters , including an icl contribution .",
    "they concluded that the stellar - to - gas mass ratio relating to the gas temperature could be expressed through the relation : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is measured in kev and @xmath59 kev is one selection criterion .",
    "this parametrization was extensively discussed in ref .",
