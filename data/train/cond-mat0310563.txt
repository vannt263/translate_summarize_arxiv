    "features of the magnetic quantum oscillations of magnetization ( de haas - van alphen effect ) or of magnetoresistance ( shubnikov - de haas effect ) are known to be noticeably different in two - dimensional ( 2d ) metals from three - dimensional ( 3d ) metals .",
    "for example , the 2d de haas - van alphen effect is characterized by a sharp sawtooth - like shape at low temperatures , while the oscillations of the magnetization in 3d metals are always smooth .",
    "the difference between 2d and 3d metals can be principally understood in terms of landau levels broadening .    in the 3d case ,",
    "the fermi energy is crossed by many occupied landau levels due to the presence of states in the direction parallel to the magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "these non quantized states available for any amplitude of magnetic field act as a reservoir .",
    "the discrete nature of the landau levels is thus blurred by this broadening inherent to the dimensionality of the spectrum . as a result ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath6 oscillates negligibly with the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the oscillating part of the transport properties is always small compared to the non - oscillating part . for example , in a metal with a spherical fermi surface , the oscillating part @xmath7 of the conductivity @xmath8 is of the order of  @xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the cyclotron pulsation , and @xmath11 is the oscillating part of magnetization .    in the 2d case , there is no landau levels broadening due to dimensionality , and thus the oscillations of the thermodynamic and transport properties can be very strong .",
    "the principal source of landau level broadening is henceforth the presence of impurities in real materials . in 3d metals ,",
    "the impurity broadening is an accessory ingredient in the derivation of theory of magnetic quantum oscillations , and is usually taken into account by hand by introducing in the @xmath12th harmonic amplitude of the oscillations the so - called dingle factor @xmath13 with @xmath14 the zero field value of the imaginary part of the impurity self - energy .",
    "such a factor has received a microscopic justification in ref .",
    "on the other hand , the consideration of impurities effects on the magnetic quantum oscillations is of the first importance in the theory of magnetic quantum oscillations in 2d metals .",
    "the broadening due to point - like impurities is usually investigated in the so - called self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) which leads to oscillations of the imaginary part of the energy - dependent impurity self - energy @xmath15 . in high magnetic fields ,",
    "the oscillations of @xmath15 become very strong .",
    "in such a regime , the mere consideration of point - like impurities has been shown to be inappropriate to describe correctly the magnetic quantum oscillations  @xcite . to our knowledge , the complete and satisfactory theory of the impurities effects on magnetic quantum oscillations , i.e. of the lifting of the degeneracy of the landau levels due to impurities , still does not exist .",
    "another problem which arises in 2d metals is the presence of nonnegligible chemical potential oscillations when the system is isolated .",
    "actually , the influence of oscillations of @xmath6 on the shape of the magnetization oscillations or magnetoresistivity oscillations can be investigated at a semi - phenomenological level ( by bypassing the microscopic problem with the impurities which determines the exact dependence of the chemical potential with the magnetic field ) and makes no important difficulty  @xcite .    in quasi-2d metals with the magnetic field perpendicular to the layers , the energy spectrum has the form @xmath16 with @xmath17 the interlayer momentum , @xmath2 the interlayer transfer integral and @xmath18 the interlayer distance .",
    "the situation concerning the landau levels broadening is in some sense intermediate between the 2d and 3d cases and depends on the ratio @xmath19 : the landau levels broadening due to dimensionality is strongly effective when @xmath20 . in the opposite limit , when @xmath21 , the landau levels are broadened only through the impurities effects , exactly like in 2d metals .",
    "it is worth noting that the 3d de haas - van alphen and shubnikov - de haas theories are not directly applicable to quasi-2d metals because the saddle - point method used in the calculations of the 3d case  @xcite breaks down with the spectrum ( [ spectreq2d ] ) when @xmath22 .",
    "the ( semi - phenomenological ) theory of the de haas - van alphen effect in quasi-2d metals  @xcite has revealed a crossover between the 2d and 3d limits for the behavior of the magnetization oscillations .",
    "it was with the same idea of a reduced dimensionality driven by the ratio @xmath19 that we studied the magnetoresistance oscillations in quasi-2d metals  @xcite .",
    "the regime @xmath23 has been investigated in details in ref .",
    "@xcite and in references therein . here",
    ", we are rather interested in the 2d limit @xmath21 , motivated by the experiments of wosnitza _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and nam _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the organic layered conductor @xmath4 .",
    "giant shubnikov - de haas oscillations of the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath0 were observed at high magnetic fields and low temperatures . in particular , a regime with a thermally activated behavior of the minima of the magnetoconductivity @xmath3 has been pointed out for magnetic fields higher than 20 t  @xcite .",
    "such a feature is completely absent in the 3d shubnikov - de haas theory .",
    "strong oscillations of @xmath0 were also reported in the organic conductor @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the observation of slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance in a field region @xcite implies that the situation in this compound is presumably intermediate between the two regimes @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the 2d limit in quasi-2d metals is problematic concerning the theoretical treatment of the impurities effects .",
    "being aware of this weakness , only qualitative properties based on general theoretical considerations ( i.e. without making specific assumptions about the form of the impurity self - energy ) are expected to be reasonable at this stage .",
    "the relevance of the 2d limit in the conductor @xmath4 is indicated by the sawtooth shape of the de haas - van alphen signal already observed for fields @xmath25 t  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnetization ocillations  @xcite are also consistent with negligibly small chemical potential oscillations in this compound .",
    "the reason for this is still unclear",
    ". an explanation may be the presence of an intrinsic non - quantized reservoir formed by quasi-1d bands .",
    "we note that another mechanism for reducing the chemical potential oscillations may be the magnetostriction .",
    "indeed , the volume of the sample is not fixed in the conditions of experiments and thus is expected to vary with the variation of magnetization .",
    "the changes in the chemical potential associated with the oscillations of the density of states and with the magnetostriction might be cancelled under particular conditions  @xcite .    in the following sections , we derive first the form of @xmath26 in the 2d limit for a point - like impurity scattering with an arbitrary impurity self - energy .",
    "the mechanism of appearance of the thermal activation of conductivity minima is pointed out .",
    "then , assuming a specific form for the impurity self - energy , we have performed a numerical analysis of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of @xmath0 oscillations to compare with experiments  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to point - like impurity scattering , which allows us to neglect the vertex corrections .",
    "the magnetoconductivity @xmath26 consists of two pieces susceptible of oscillating with the magnetic field  @xcite @xmath27,\\ ] ] the boltzmann piece @xmath28 and a pure quantum piece @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the derivative of the fermi dirac distribution function , @xmath31 is the constant 2d density of states ( at @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the advanced and retarded green s functions .    in the 2d limit @xmath35",
    ", the summation over the landau levels can be performed analytically to give  @xcite    @xmath36    and @xmath37 with @xmath38 here the function @xmath39 is still unknown , since no specific assumption about the impurity self - energy has been made yet .",
    "for @xmath40 , it is straightforward to note that the two contributions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are compensated between the landau levels , and are summed at the landau levels , to give @xmath43 the spectral conductivity @xmath44 between the landau levels is very small and flat over a wide range in energy . to illustrate the particular behavior of @xmath44 at @xmath40",
    ", we have represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the functions ( [ ra ] ) and ( [ rr ] ) for a constant @xmath45 .",
    "if the chemical potential oscillations are negligibly small , the main means of conduction between the landau levels at a finite low temperature is the thermal excitation at the edges of the gap - like range @xmath46 .",
    "this explains why the conductivity is minimal for integer values of @xmath47 with the thermally activated dependence @xmath48 at very low temperatures , quasi - particles whose energy lies in the @xmath46 range mainly contribute to conduction , and the minima of conductivity saturate .",
    "if the thermally activated behavior can be pointed out by qualitative arguments , i.e. without invoking a specific model for @xmath15 , the study at a quantitative level needs specific assumptions concerning the impurity self - energy .",
    "as declared in introduction , such investigation has to be done with care , since the theory in the 2d limit does not exist yet .",
    "since the chemical potential may be fixed in @xmath4 by a finite reservoir formed by a quasi-1d band  @xcite , we proposed  @xcite to include this reservoir in the calculations of @xmath15 within a model of short - range impurity scattering . using the scba",
    ", we obtained the self - consistent equation  @xcite @xmath49 \\label{scba}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the strength of the finite reservoir . for @xmath51 ( no reservoir ) and @xmath52 , this equation leads to the absence of states between the landau levels .",
    "this unphysical result  @xcite is avoided as soon as @xmath53 .",
    "assuming the value @xmath54 necessary for suppressing significantly the chemical potential oscillations  @xcite , we found  @xcite that the oscillations of @xmath55 are of the order of 10 % for @xmath56 t , and thus neglected them in our numerical calculation  @xcite ( i.e. we took @xmath57 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the oscillations of @xmath0 at different temperatures . the thermal activation of @xmath0 maxima is well reproduced numerically for fields @xmath58 t.",
    "our model considering only short - range impurity scattering and the spectrum ( [ spectreq2d ] ) therefore accounts for the thermal activation of @xmath26 minima in presence of negligibly small chemical potential oscillations , as observed in the layered conductor @xmath4 .",
    "however , there remain some qualitative features in experiments  @xcite not explained by our theoretical model , such as the increase of @xmath0 minima with the magnetic field at high magnetic fields and low temperatures .",
    "it is worth noting that under these latter conditions , the landau levels broadening due to point - like impurity scattering alone is probably ineffective .",
    "landau levels broadening due to impurity scattering on finite range becomes predominant and has to be envisaged as being physically relevant for seizing the complete behavior of @xmath0 oscillations ."
