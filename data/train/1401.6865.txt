    "patterns in effective two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluids flows are found in nature in various contexts @xcite : atmospheric @xcite and oceanic flows @xcite are examples . to understand such large scale patterns",
    "theoretically , the 2d euler equation describing perfect fluids flows is a simplified starting point . in this context",
    ", the study of nonlinear structures , such as kelvin s cat s eyes , over a shear flow has a long history @xcite , which includes more recent mathematical developments @xcite .",
    "statistical physics has often been invoked to explain the formation of large vortices since onsager @xcite .",
    "the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) theory @xcite , which constructs the microcanonical measure for 2d euler flows by taking all the invariants into account , is a particularly successful achievement .",
    "a difficulty in applying this theory in practice is the fact that the 2d euler equation has infinitely many invariants .",
    "more importantly , the theory assumes the vorticity field on the large scales to be stationary , and therefore can not describe non - stationary asymptotic behaviors .",
    "for these cases , the statistical physics approach should be supplemented by a dynamical understanding of pattern formations .    in this paper , we consider a shear base flow to which a perturbation is added , and propose a phenomenological approach to the pattern formations by analyzing the landau pole of the linearized equation with its bifurcation , and by taking into account nonlinear effects .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of this situation are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite : starting from a kolmogorov flow on the doubly periodic domain @xmath0 , a perturbation of size @xmath1 is added ; depending on the parameters @xmath2 , the perturbation may fully damp , evolve into a stationary dipole , or create four long lived traveling vortices .",
    "the regions on the @xmath2 plane where the dipole or traveling vortices appear are numerically investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but a theoretical understanding is lacking . in this article , we aim at providing such a theoretical explanation , by exploiting the analogy between the 2d euler equation for the vorticity field and the vlasov equation for plasmas . indeed , a similar phenomenon has been investigated in one - dimensional plasmas , described by the vlasov equation .",
    "a naive linear theory predicts that perturbations added to stable stationary states damp exponentially @xcite .",
    "it is well known , however , that , if the perturbation is large enough , nonlinear effects come into play , prevent complete damping , and may create traveling clusters @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the simpler cases of ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic hamiltonian mean - field model . to be more precise , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , such a phenomenon occurs when the two following criteria are satisfied :    1 .   the landau damping time scale is longer than a nonlinear timescale , called `` trapping timescale '' .",
    "if several clusters are formed , they should be so small that they do not overlap and that a nonlinear superposition approximation @xcite may work .",
    "although these criteria are in view of nonlinear dynamics , they can be expressed using the dominant landau pole computed from the linearized euler equation .",
    "our goal is to draw the phase diagram in the @xmath2 plane by using the above two criteria in the context of the euler equation , that is , by combining the phenomenological nonlinear estimate and the linear landau damping theory .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conditions ] , we qualitatively analyze criteria 1 and 2 , and show that they are related to the imaginary and the real parts of the dominant landau pole of the initial kolmogorov flow .",
    "we therefore briefly review the linear theory for 2d incompressible and inviscid fluids , and derive the dispersion relation in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] ; the computation of the landau pole requires an analytic continuation procedure similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite . using these computations",
    ", we draw a phase diagram in the @xmath2 plane in sec . [",
    "sec : phased ] , and compare this phenomenological estimate with numerical simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "we start from the 2d euler equation in the domain @xmath3 @xmath4 where the vorticity field @xmath5 and the velocity field @xmath6 are related to a stream function @xmath7 through @xmath8 the periods for @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes are set as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "we consider the stationary kolmogorov flow , called hereafter the `` base flow '' , whose stream function is @xmath13 and vorticity and velocity fields are respectively @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "we add a large scale perturbation to the base flow , and expand the stream function as @xmath16 with @xmath17 in our analytical computations , @xmath1 is assumed to be small ; this restriction obviously does not hold for numerical simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the theory will be qualitatively in good agreement with the simulations .",
    "when the base flow is stable ( this corresponds to an aspect ratio @xmath18 ) , the linear theory typically predicts that the perturbation damps and possibly oscillates at complex frequency @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the root of the dispersion relation yielding the slowest damping , that is , the root closest to the real axis , or , in other words , with the smallest @xmath21 .",
    "the idea is that while it damps , the perturbation will tend to create structures traveling at velocity @xmath22 ; if nonlinear effects are strong enough , these structures may persist for long times .",
    "if @xmath23 , one may expect traveling vortices , while the formation of two stationary vortices ( a dipole ) should be favored if @xmath24 .",
    "the damping time scale @xmath25 is easily estimated as the inverse of the landau damping rate @xmath26 .",
    "actually , in addition to the exponential landau damping described by @xmath27 , there is an algebraic damping coming from the branch points of the dispersion function ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : linear ] ) ; however , the exponential landau damping is expected to be dominant on the time scale considered in this paper .",
    "next , we estimate the `` trapping time scale '' , @xmath28 , which is the characteristic time scale concerning nonlinearities  @xcite , as the period of a test point vortex trapped around the edge of a small vortex .",
    "the temporal evolution of the position of a test point vortex is governed by the velocity field @xmath29 where the dot denotes @xmath30 .",
    "we approximate the perturbation @xmath31 phenomenologically .",
    "we are interested in the macroscopic behavior corresponding to the @xmath32 mode , where @xmath33 is the wave number with respect to @xmath9 , and we assume that the damping perturbation has created small vortices whose velocity is @xmath22 in the @xmath9 direction ; note that @xmath22 can be  @xmath34 .",
    "the first order @xmath31 can be , therefore , approximated by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is of @xmath37 . substituting eq . into eq .",
    ", we have the approximate equations of motion @xmath38 where the prime represents @xmath39 .",
    "thanks to the phenomenological approximation of @xmath40 , we can compute the motion of the test point vortex by perturbation techniques . expanding @xmath9 and @xmath10 into series of @xmath1 as @xmath41",
    "we obtain the solutions @xmath42 and @xmath43 with initial conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 equations for the first order in @xmath1 are : @xmath47 from the frequency of @xmath48 in eq . , we estimate the trapping time scale @xmath28 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 , and @xmath52 represents the width of a vortex .    the unknown quantity , the width of a vortex @xmath53 , is determined self - consistently . the solution @xmath54 is , from eq . ,",

    "the amplitude in the @xmath10 direction , @xmath57 , must be the same as the width @xmath53 at the edge of the vortex , @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the self - consistent equation for @xmath59 is @xmath60 where we have introduced another phenomenological approximation by replacing @xmath61 with @xmath62 , since it is of @xmath37 and we are looking for an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "the width @xmath59 is , therefore , estimated as @xmath63 for the kolmogorov base flow , @xmath15 , we have @xmath64 and the trapping time scale is @xmath65 criterion 1 reads @xmath66 , that is : @xmath67",
    "if @xmath24 , this condition simplifies into @xmath68 .      according to eq . , we consider the modes @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the frequency @xmath22 of the perturbation reflects the existence of periodically moving vortices , thanks to the periodic boundary condition for the @xmath9 axis . the period @xmath11 permits to identify the frequency with the velocity of the moving vortices , and therefore the @xmath10 positions of the vortices are estimated as the solutions of the equation @xmath69 .",
    "we recall the base flow is @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath24 , one expects that vortices are formed at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the estimate of the vortices width shows that the vortices will never overlap for any reasonably small @xmath1 ( say for instance @xmath72 ) .",
    "hence criterion 2 brings no restriction in this case .",
    "if @xmath23 , in contrast , the vortices can be close one to another , and criterion 2 leads to a restriction .",
    "we name the four vortices a , b , c , and d , whose @xmath10 positions are , respectively , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the interval @xmath77 , where we take the branch of solutions @xmath78 ; see fig .",

    "suitably rescaled .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines correspond to @xmath79 ; their intersections with the velocity curve , @xmath69 , yield the estimated @xmath10 positions of the four vortices , which travel along the horizontal dotted lines .",
    ", width=264 ]    we assume that each vortex has the same width @xmath59 .",
    "then the distance between two nearby vortices must be larger than @xmath80 in order to avoid an overlap .",
    "using @xmath81 , this condition is expressed as @xmath82 the first inequality comes from the distance in @xmath10 between vortices a and b ( identically c and d ) , and the second from the distance between b and c ( identically a and d ) . the pair ( b , c ) moves toward the left while ( a , d ) toward the right according to the base flow @xmath83 . moreover",
    ", the numerical observations @xcite say that the difference in @xmath9 among each pair stays around @xmath84 .",
    "thus the distance between b and c ( a and d ) is large enough to neglect the effect of overlapping ; see fig .",

    "we emphasize that the bifurcation of the dominant landau pole as the aspect ratio is varied plays a crucial role in the theory .",
    "since this kind of bifurcation is probably not a special feature of the kolmogorov flow , we expect that a similar analysis , predicting the appearance , or not , of a dipole or traveling vortices , would be fruitful for other base flows .",
    "we note that our prediction is in qualitative , though not quantitative , agreement with the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite , not only for the shape of the phase diagram , but also for the vortex frequency .",
    "the quantitative discrepancy for the phase diagram is rather natural since we have performed phenomenological order - of - magnitude estimates and not taken the prefactors into consideration .",
    "the reason for the quantitative disagreement in the frequency is probably that the size of the perturbation @xmath1 used in the numerical simulation is large enough to trigger nonlinear effects that we do not take into account , while such a large @xmath1 is necessary to realize the oscillating phase numerically .",

    "<S> the theory is based on a precise study of the inviscid damping of the linearized equation and on an analysis of nonlinear effects . in particular , we show that the dominant landau pole controlling the inviscid damping undergoes a bifurcation , which has important consequences on the asymptotic fate of the perturbation . </S>"
