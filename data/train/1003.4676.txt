    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are extragalactic sources composed by a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) , an accretion disk and bipolar relativistic jets .",
    "some agns present continuum emission in the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to @xmath0-rays . besides the continuum radiation",
    ", agns also have optical and ultra - violet line emission .",
    "some of these lines are broad , emitted by gas moving at velocities @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 and located in a region close ( @xmath3  cm ) to the smbh .",
    "the structure of the matter in the broad line region ( blr ) is not well known but some models assume that the gas could be clumpy .",
    "dense clouds , confined by the hot external medium or by magnetic fields , would be ionized by photons from the accretion disk producing the emission lines broadened by the movement of the clouds around the smbh . in the particular case of faranoff riley ( fr )",
    "i galaxies , where the accretion disks have low luminosities , the photoionization of the clouds will be inefficient to produce lines and the clouds might be dark .",
    "centaurus a ( cen a ) and m87 are the closest agns , located at distances of @xmath4 and @xmath5  mpc , respectively .",
    "these agns are classified as fr i radio sources and in the case of cen a the nuclear region is obscured by a dense torus of gas and dust .",
    "although the blrs of cen a and m87 have not been detected  @xcite , clouds with similar characteristic to those detected in fr ii agns may surround the smbh  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the high - energy emission produced by the interaction of these possibly dark clouds with the jets of the agn .",
    "we focus here on cen a and m87 , since their moderate accretion rate would imply reduced photon - photon opacities in the interaction region , allowing @xmath0-rays to escape . assuming standard parameters for the clouds and jets , we study the main physical processes that take place as a consequence of the interaction , and calculate the expected high - energy emission .",
    "we consider that clouds with density @xmath6  @xmath7 and size @xmath8  cm are surrounding the smbh and one of these clouds penetrates into one of the relativistic jets .",
    "we assume that the jet has a lorentz factor @xmath9 ( i.e. a bulk velocity @xmath10 ) , a radius @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the distance to the black hole ) , and a kinetic luminosity @xmath13  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "the penetration time of the cloud into the jet is determined by @xmath14  s , where @xmath15  cm  s@xmath2 is the cloud velocity . as a consequence of the interaction of the jet material with the cloud , two shocks form .",
    "one of these shocks propagates back in the reference frame of the jet with a velocity @xmath16 , producing a bow shock .",
    "this bow shock reaches the steady state configuration in a time @xmath17 , where the stagnation point is taken at a distance @xmath18 from the cloud ( this value is obtained considering particle flux conservation and assuming an escape velocity equal to the downstream sound speed ) . on the other hand , a shock propagates inside the cloud at a velocity @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the jet density in the shock reference frame .",
    "in a time @xmath22 the whole cloud is shocked .",
    "the permanence of the cloud into the jet is determined by the passage time of the cloud in the jet , defined by @xmath23 .",
    "however , the cloud is accelerated by the jet , starting to move with the outflow .",
    "the acceleration of the cloud is @xmath24 .",
    "the acceleration timescale can be estimated from @xmath25 , which is the time required to accelerate the cloud up to @xmath26 in the jet direction , hence one can assume that the bow shock will remain strong only during several times @xmath27 . as a consequence of the pressure exerted by the jet onto the cloud , rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities can develop in the interface .",
    "in addition , kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities can grow as a result of the high relative velocity between the jet shocked material and the cloud . in a first order approach",
    ", we obtain that rt and kh instabilities grow sufficiently to destroy the cloud on a timescale @xmath28 . in order to estimate the lifetime of the cloud into the jet",
    ", we compare @xmath29 and @xmath27 .",
    "we can parametrize @xmath30 , @xmath31 , obtaining @xmath32 . considering that @xmath26 depends on @xmath12 through the parameter @xmath33",
    ", we can obtain the interaction height : @xmath34  cm . adopting @xmath35 results",
    "@xmath36  s and @xmath37  s , i.e. the cloud will be destroyed by the jet before escaping or approaching the jet velocity ( with the subsequent weakening of the shock ) .",
    "in this work we consider only the particle acceleration in the bow shock , neglecting the contribution from the shock in the cloud .",
    "we assume that particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies , being injected in the downstream region of the bow shock following a distribution @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 for electrons and protons , respectively ) . assuming that a @xmath41 of the jet luminosity that reaches the cloud goes to accelerate particles",
    ", the luminosity of these will be @xmath42 .",
    "considering that the magnetic energy density in the bow - shock region is the 10% of the non - thermal one , we obtain a magnetic field @xmath43  g in that region .",
    "the main radiative losses that affect the evolution of @xmath44 are synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scattering . on the other hand , considering ultra - violet seed photons with a luminosity @xmath45  erg  s@xmath2 ( a larger value is unlikely in the nuclear region of fr i galaxies ) the external compton ( ec ) cooling is not relevant , as shown in fig .",
    "relativistic bremsstrahlung losses produced by the interaction with the jet matter in the bow - shock downstream region is not important either .",
    "in addition to the radiative losses , electrons escape from the emitter on a time @xmath46 . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the maximum energy is determined by synchrotron losses , given @xmath47  tev . to obtain the distribution @xmath48 of relativistic electrons , we solve the kinetic equation",
    "( see ref .  ) but taking into account not only the losses mentioned above but also the synchrotron photon field as ssc target , for which we need to use an iterative approach due the non - linear nature of the problem to solve .",
    "we obtain that the steady state is reached on a timescale @xmath49 .",
    "the energy distribution of electrons @xmath50 has a break at energy @xmath51  gev due to electron escape ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .    in the case of protons",
    ", these particles can lose energy via @xmath52 interactions in the bow - shock region but the diffusion losses are more important , constraining the maximum energy to @xmath53  tev .",
    "the most energetic protons , @xmath54  tev , diffuse up to the cloud before escaping advected by the shocked material of the jet .",
    "in the bow - shock region , using standard formulae @xcite and the electron energy distribution , we compute the synchrotron and ssc emission . in the cloud , energetic protons that arrive from the bow shock are not confined and escape from the cloud on a time @xmath55 before radiating a significant part of their energy .",
    "considering that the distribution of protons in the cloud is @xmath56 , we compute the @xmath52 emission following the formulae given in ref .  .",
    "the synchrotron emission is self - absorbed at energies @xmath57  ev , but at higher energies auto - absorption and @xmath58 absorption ( see ref .  ) are negligible in the region of interest .",
    "the achieved luminosity at energies @xmath59  gev is @xmath60  erg  s@xmath2 , being slightly less than the sensitivity of hess and _ fermi _ at the distance of cen a as is shown in fig .",
    "note that we show the result of the interaction of only one cloud with the jet , but many clouds could simultaneously interact with the jet .",
    "the total luminosity produced by jet - cloud interactions depends on the number of clouds inside the jet , each one producing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with similar characteristics and luminosity levels to those shown in fig .",
    "the number of clouds inside the jet is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the filling factor of dark clouds , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the jet and the cloud volume , respectively . considering @xmath63 up to @xmath65  cm and @xmath66 ( in fr ii galaxies @xmath67 ) , we obtain @xmath68 . in the whole sphere of size @xmath69",
    "cm the number of clouds is @xmath70 for the considered value of @xmath62 .",
    "the simultaneous interaction of @xmath71 10 clouds with the jet will produce more luminosity than the one produced by only one interaction .",
    "if all the clouds have the same properties ( i.e. @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and are located at @xmath75 in the jet , then the contribution of 10 clouds will produce a sed with a similar appearence than that shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , but with a luminosity @xmath71 10 times larger , being now detectable by hess and _ fermi _ telescopes in the case of cen a , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . the emission detected by these instruments from cen  a is larger than the luminosity predicted by our model",
    ". however , if clouds are larger than @xmath76  cm , the luminosity level detected by hess@xcite and _ _ fermi__@xcite could be achieved .",
    "a more detailed calculation of the emission produced by many clouds interacting with the jet at different @xmath12 will be presented in a future work@xcite .    in the case of m87",
    ", the jet base is expected to be at @xmath77  cm . at such a height on the jet ,",
    "the jet - cloud interaction will be inefficient producing high - energy emission due to the small cloud to jet section ratio . in order to obtain a detectable luminosity , clouds with a radius @xmath78  cm",
    "would be necessary . in the case of a very big cloud entering the jet close to @xmath79 in m87 , the interaction might produce the variable luminosity detected by hess@xcite .",
