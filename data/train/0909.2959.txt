    "galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) are now as many as 274 @xcite .",
    "most of them are observed in radio wavelengths from their non - thermal synchrotron emission despite their very few optical observations .",
    "the reason for this is because of the dust and gas around the galactic disk stopping the optical light coming from them .",
    "however , only recently optical observations of snrs can be performed by using narrow - band interference filters and providing rather long posing intervals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recently , x - ray satellites like chandra , xmm - newton , suzaku observed some snrs in x - ray band .    the galactic supernova remnant g85.9 - 0.6 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) was discovered in the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) @xcite .",
    "g85.9 - 0.6 has a radio surface brightness at 1 ghz of @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite has detected no hi features corresponding to the snr .",
    "this and the low radio and x - ray brightness , suggest expansion in a low - density medium .",
    "the snr may lie in the low - density region between the local and perseus spiral arms , at a distance of about 5 kpc .",
    "the most likely event that would produce an snr in such a low density medium might be a type ia supernova .",
    "it has a radius of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "g85.9 - 0.6 has a diffuse type structure in x - ray region , where its electron density is @xmath16 @xmath4 and the ejecta mass is at order of @xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "[ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is an important criteria to distinguish hii regions and snrs @xcite . in hii regions most sulphur atoms are in the form of siii , since there is a strong photo - ionization and [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is expected to be in the range of @xmath19 @xcite",
    ", however recent models give this range to be 0.1 - 0.5 @xcite , for snrs on the other hand , it is 0.5 - 1.0 @xcite .    in this work , we selected the snrs ( g16.2 - 2.7 , g17.8 - 2.6 , g36.6 + 2.6 , g83.0 - 0.3 and g85.9 - 0.6 ) that have no optical observation in literature so far and have proper coordinates to observe at tug .",
    "we take their h@xmath0 images with 300 seconds exposure time .",
    "theoretical models predict that , in snrs , the temperature of the regions that give optical emission should be at @xmath20 @xmath21 , therefore , the intensity of h@xmath0 emission line should be larger compared to the other emission lines .",
    "for this reason , h@xmath0 interference filters are preferred for determining snrs @xcite . with h@xmath0",

    "an optical spectrum of snr g85.9 - 0.6 , covering 3750 - 7250 @xmath27 range , was obtained on ut 2009 june 16 at the bok 2.3 m telescope on kitt peak , az , using the boller and chivens spectrograph at the richey - chretien f/ 9 focus together with a thinned back - illuminated 1200@xmath22800 , 15@xmath23 pixel loral ccd .",

    "in this work , the imaging and spectroscopic observations of the central part ( @xmath50 ) of the galactic supernova remnant g85.9 - 0.6 is observed for the first time in optical band .",
    "the images show diffuse emission structure . as seen from the figures 1,3 , the dominant emission extends from south - west to north .",
    "the diffuse emission centered at @xmath51 , @xmath52 that covers an area @xmath53 is very well correlated with radio emission ( see fig.4 ) .",

    "this ratio is @xmath10.5 , 0.6 on the places where dominant diffuse emission comes indicating ionization of the shock heated gas resulted from collision . on the other hand , the ratio of @xmath10.2 - 0.3 on the places where emission is faint indicating that resulted emission originate from photoionization mechanism .",
    "[ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio obtained from imaging is at 0.42 which is in agrement with spectral measurements of 0.46 .",
    "these values imply that diffuse emission of g85.9 - 0.6 may be associated with hii region .    from the spectra",
    ", we see the presence of h@xmath0 , h@xmath5 , [ oiii]@xmath28 , [ nii]@xmath29 and [ sii]@xmath30 , in addition a weaker [ oi]@xmath54 and [ oiii]@xmath55 emission lines . the presence of [ oi]@xmath54 line emission indicates that the emission is originating from shock heated gas .",
    "theoretical models predict electron temperature through [ oiii]j(@xmath56)ratio . since [ oiii]@xmath55 emission line is very close to hg i @xmath57 , it is almost impossible to differentiate them @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electron temperature ( t ) assumed to be @xmath31 @xmath21 in this work .",
    "we detected a weak [ oiii]/h@xmath5 emission line ratio at 1.18 indicating an oxygen - deficient remnant .",
    "theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite give that for shocks with complete recombination zones this value is @xmath16 , while this limit is exceeded in case of shocks with incomplete recombination zones @xcite .",
    "our values measured from spectra indicates that complete recombination takes place at those regions .",
    "therefore , considering our measurements and the theoretical models mentioned above we estimated the velocity of the shock to be @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "since the g85.9 - 0.6 lies in the region between the local and perseus spiral arms , it has a reliable distance , of 5 kpc @xcite . for this distance and @xmath60 we calculated shock radius ( @xmath61 ) to be @xmath1 @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "explosion energy and hydrogen column density of the g85.9 - 0.9 for this radius and estimated shock velocity is calculated , to be @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath4 respectively .",
    "this much energy can be considered as the typical energy released from a supernova explosion .",
    "typical value of the sulfur line ratio [ sii]@xmath67 for snrs should be close to 1.5 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is calculated to be 1.13 indicating low electron density which is calculated as 395 @xmath4 for this region .",
    "we note here that , providing rather long exposure times and examining its surrounding region will give more information about the morphology and angular size of the g85.9 - 0.6 in optical band .",
    "the images taken with different interference filters like [ nii ] , [ oiii ] will give more information about the inhomogeneities and density variations of the medium .",
