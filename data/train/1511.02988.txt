    "recent observations of protoplanetary disks reveal clear spiral features ( e.g. , muto et al .",

    "currie et al .",
    "2014 , benisty et al .",
    "2015 ) , as seen in polarized scattered light in near infrared .",
    "given the high density of the disk , the micron - sized dust grains responsible for the scattering must be suspended high in the disk atmosphere to produce these features .",
    "numerical simulations of planet - disk interaction ( e.g. bryden et al . 1999 , kley 1999 , lubow et al .  1999 ,",
    "baruteau et al .",
    "2014 ) have shown the formation of distinctive one - armed spirals .",
    "even the very first of such calculations ( miki 1982 ) , although done in two dimensions ( 2d ) in a local box , already shows evidence of a spiral pattern excited by the planet .",
    "high - mass planets can lead to strong spiral shocks , while low - mass planets ( e.g. neptune ) produce spirals with only slight density enhancements . in the low - mass limit",
    ", the perturbations can be treated using linear theory , and ogilvie & lubow ( 2002 ) showed that the shape of the spiral density perturbation launched by such a low - mass planet can be predicted analytically as a superposition of the individual fourier modes .    although it is tempting to assume that the observed spiral features are indeed due to planets , several of the observed spirals have pitch angles too wide to fit the analytical predictions based on linear theory in the simplest case of an azimuthally - isothermal disk .",
    "since the pitch angle in the linear theory depends on the sound speed , this implies that the spirals are launched from higher temperatures than the ambient gas .",
    "mwc 758 , for instance has a measured background temperature of @xmath353k at 50au ( isella et al .",
    "2010 ) , yet a fit to the analytical model requires a temperature of @xmath3300k to match the observed spirals ( benisty et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "nonetheless , if planets do produce these spirals , the simplest explanation for the observed spiral morphologies may be that the planets are too massive for their influence on the disk to be described by linear theory .",
    "the linear theory requires the planets to be of low mass , so that the wake launched is subsonic",
    ". if the planet is massive , the wake launched propagates faster than the speed of sound , and steepens into a shock near the planet .",
    "the shape of the spiral shock then rapidly deviates from that predicted from linear theory .",
    "evidence of this behavior has been abundantly clear in the literature for at least a decade , visibly seen in the disk - planet simulations in the code comparison of de val - borro et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in that study , 14 independent codes were used to reproduce viscous and inviscid simulations of neptune - mass and jupiter - mass planets . whereas the shape of the spirals launched by the neptune - mass planets were described well by linear theory ( ogilvie & lubow 2002 ) , the spirals launched by the jupiter - mass planets deviated from it substantially .",
    "it was understood that this feature was due to the jupiter - mass planet driving shocks that were outside the range of applicability of linear theory .",
    "dong et al . ( 2015 ) and zhu et al .  (",
    "2015 ) have recently shown that a weakly nonlinear theory ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002 ) can reproduce the pitch angle of spiral shocks launched by high - mass planets .    yet , even though a higher pitch angle can reproduce the spiral launched by high - mass planets reasonably well , without requiring _ ad hoc _ high aspect ratios , there are still features that require high temperatures . for instance , in the circumstellar material around hd 100546 , a spiral - like feature is seen ( currie et al",
    ".  2014 , 2015 ) showing little polarization .",
    "this implies that the emission is thermal rather than scattered starlight , and thus must of the order of 1000 k to reproduce the infrared brightness ( in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] we examine the observational data and determine the temperature needed to reproduce the h and l@xmath4 magnitudes to be 465@xmath540 k ) .",
    "we have recently shown in richert et al .",
    "( 2015 , hereafter paper i ) that when a planet is massive enough to produce a spiral wave that steepens into a shock , the associated shock dissipation can significantly heat the disk .",
    "if the radiative efficiency of the disk is low , the temperature can rise until buoyancy upsets the force balance .",
    "this can cause disk turbulence with significant angular momentum transport .",
    "effectively , the gravitational potential well of the planet powers a vigorous heat source .    here",
    "we report three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations exploring the same behavior .",
    "there are significant qualitative differences between 2d and 3d in this problem .",
    "the midplane is close to adiabatic , but the atmosphere of the disk behaves more isothermally because it can more quickly cool radiatively .",
    "this effect alone will already lead to a different behavior in 3d , since now the energy buildup due to shocks has to occur within the time that it takes for energy to diffuse from the midplane to the atmosphere ( from which it escapes efficiently ) .",
    "also , upward motions that bring a gas parcel from the midplane into the atmosphere will quickly lead to efficient cooling .",
    "another major difference is that a shock will be weaker in 3d , because the extra dimension translates into an extra degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , when the shock expands adiabatically , it can accelerate material in the vertical direction .",
    "this was discussed in detail in boley & durisen ( 2006 ) , who referred to the structure as shock bores , following the work of gomez & cox ( 2004 ) on galactic disk shocks . as gas shocks and",
    "accelerates upwards , a column of hot , thin gas forms around the colder and denser gas just outside of the spiral shocks .",
    "when the jetted material falls back towards the disk surface , breaking waves can form , similar in appearance to beach surf .",
    "if strong enough , these waves should produce localized turbulence around the locations of the lindblad resonance .",
    "we intend in this paper to find signatures of this process in 3d , non - isothermal disks containing high - mass planets .",
    "although our work resembles that of zhu et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in that we both model 3d , nonisothermal disks with high - mass planets in order to examine the effect of their shocks , there are also significant differences in technique and focus . while zhu et al .",
    "( 2015 ) use a fixed cooling time with an exponential fall to isothermal beyond three scale heights , we use a dynamical cooling time dependent on vertical optical depth , that varies following the movements of the material .",
    "zhu et al .  ( 2015 ) examined the shape of the spiral launched by the planet , while we focus on the effect of the shocks on disk accretion and energy budget . because of that , zhu et al .",
    "only ran their disks for 10 orbits , halting before gap opening and substantial alteration of the disk structure , while we ran to 40 orbits , long enough to achieve gap opening .",

    "a secondary weaker bow shock forms just downstream , leading to a smaller lobe of warm temperature .",

    "we would like to quantify the level of angular momentum transport that is caused by this turbulence at the corotation radius of the region around 2/3@xmath91 where the lindblad resonances cluster together ( which we henceforth call the lindblad lobe ) .",
    "for that we measure the alpha value ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) ,    @xmath92    this @xmath93 measures how much angular momentum is transported radially .",
    "we can also measure how much angular momentum is transported vertically ( or meridionally ) by computing    @xmath94    we measure these quantities averaged in azimuth within @xmath95 above and below the midplane , which corresponds roughly to 1 scale height each way .",
    "we then average the snapshots from 10 to 40 orbits . the result is plotted in fig .  [ fig : alphas ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the radial transport of angular momentum , the lower panel the vertical transport .",
    "we see that the vertical transport is essentially negligible , whereas the radial transport peaks in the region where the lindblad resonances cluster together ( which we henceforth call the lindblad lobe ) with an average of @xmath96 in the inner and @xmath97 in the outer .",
    "frequently the @xmath2 value in the outer lindblad lobe exceeds 0.1 , characterizing strong accretion with a characteristic velocity @xmath98 .",
    "some activity is also seen in the annulus around 10au . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature - meridional ] , we see this correlates with incipient rolls forming at @xmath99=3.5 , 8.5 and 11.5au .",
    "these appear to be buoyant expansion , radially and vertically , of the hot gas as it propagates outwards from the spiral shock .",
    "we tentatively identify the rolls as convection , which is also consistent with the indications of turbulent flow seen from 3 to 8 au in the midplane plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : shocks ] ( right panel ) as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : utht - midplane ] . to check that identification , we plot the entropy deviation ( with respect to the initial condition ) in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig : entropy - meridional ] .",
    "we saturate the plot to avoid domination by the structures near the planet and highlight instead the variations in the outer disk .",
    "indeed , a blob of high entropy is seen in the midplane , from about 8.5 to 11au .    to determine if this blob indeed would lead to convection , we determine if the entropy gradient is superadiabatic .",
    "the adiabatic gradient is    @xmath100    gradients steeper than this will generate convection .",
    "we plot in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy - meridional ] the quantity @xmath101 along the meridional axis at @xmath102  au , which is near the center of the blob .",
    "the dotted line traces the value of the adiabatic gradient .",
    "we see that the gradient is indeed superadiabatic in the blob .",
    "we conclude that we are seeing convection .",
    "a planet generates not only turbulence due to breaking waves at its lindblad lobes , but also heats material that will propagate outward , generating convection far away from its orbit .    finally , we notice that the upstream and downstream temperatures ( 175k and 450k , respectively ) straddle the water ice sublimation point .",
    "this implies that ice particles passing through the hot shocks will sublimate .",
    "the timescale of sublimation can be estimated as @xmath103 ( ros & johansen 2013 ) , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the radius and internal density of the ice particles , respectively , @xmath106 is the thermal speed of water vapour , and @xmath107 is the saturation vapour pressure of water ( for which we use the expression by bauer et al . 1997 ) . in the outer shock ( @xmath108 350k ) , the sublimation timescale is @xmath109 for a decimeter - sized ice ball , meaning that the evaporation is instantaneous .",
    "yet , the water vapour will quickly recondense downstream . assuming that the sublimated ice release small silicate grains , condensation would mainly take place on the grains surfaces ( not on larger pebbles and planetesimals ) , because smaller particles have a larger surface - area / mass ratio . therefore , the net effect is the production of a large number of small silicate grains coated by ice in the flow downstream",
    ".    this sublimation process can potentially affect the size and spatial distribution of ice particles around the planet . at around 5 au ,",
    "micron - sized ice grains grow to decimeter - sized balls on a timescale of @xmath110 yr ( e.g. , brauer et al .",
    "2008 ; okuzumi et al .",
    "by contrast , the lindblad lobes sweep disk gas along their orbits on a much shorter timescale , @xmath111 . therefore , ice particles are unable to growth to macroscopic bodies near the orbits of the hot shocks .",
    "the destruction of macroscopic ice balls is unavoidable even if we consider the radial inward drift of the particles relative to the gas disk ( adachi et al .",
    "1976 ; weidenschilling 1977 ) . at 5",
    "au , the radial drift velocity of decimeter - sized particles is @xmath112 , and therefore the particles are unable to cross the shock regions ( of radial extent @xmath113 ) without being swept by the shocks .",
    "since the radial drift slows down as the particle size is decreased , the sublimation of radially drifting ice balls might lead to a pileup of dust at the shocks orbits .",
    "in paper i we showed that high - mass planets produce radial buoyancy - induced turbulence in their parent disks .",
    "the source of energy are the disk wakes generated by the planet at its lindblad resonances , which quickly steepen into shocks for massive planets .",
    "so long as the energy is deposited more rapidly than it is dissipated , the temperature rises , leading to instability and turbulence .",
    "we found that the turbulence extends throughout most of the disk , and manifests itself more strongly when the cooling is weaker .",
    "indeed , in the adiabatic limit , without cooling , shock dissipation continues to heat the disk until radial buoyancy becomes the dominant motion .",
    "paper i was a two - dimensional initial study , using newton ( beta ) cooling for exploration purposes . in the current paper we describe a 3d study of the same process , with a more sophisticated approximation for treating the radiation field in the disk . defining a beta cooling as a function of the local optical depth , we reproduce the behavior of adiabaticity ( @xmath114 ) in the midplane , and isothermality ( @xmath115 ) in the atmosphere of a stratified disk .",
    "in the model presented , the optical depth @xmath53 and the cooling time @xmath86 around the planet s orbit are of the order of 100 .",
    "for this model , we find that the turbulence continues to occur in 3d , albeit for other reasons than in 2d . from 2d",
    "to 3d the main difference is the extra degree of freedom given by the vertical direction , so that as the gas is heated , it expands vertically , which makes the shocks weaker ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "the vertical expansion gives rise to tall shock columns , extending throughout the disk , from the midplane to the atmosphere .",
    "these were referred to by boley & durisen ( 2006 ) as shock bores .",
    "we find that this process occurs at the radii whence the planet spiral wake is launched .",
    "the shocks produce hot lobes which , for our parameters , reach about 450k , three times the temperature of the quiescent gas at the same orbit .",
    "the temperature rise occurs in the midplane , where the disk is more adiabatic , as expected .",
    "as the gas meets the shock , it is accelerated upwards .",
    "falling back onto the disk it leads to breaking waves . these waves in turn give rise to turbulence in the full azimuthal extent around the orbital location of each lindblad lobe .",
    "we measure the resulting accretion stress by the shakura - sunyaev parameter , finding rapid angular momentum transport with @xmath2 about 0.05 in the inner lobe , and @xmath116 in the outer .",
    "this means locally @xmath117 .",
    "we also notice that as the heated gas expands outwards , radially and vertically , it leads to structure in the meridional plane far outward from the planet that appears to be convection .",
    "indeed , we find that these features are associated with localized blobs of high entropy around the midplane in the outer disk . measuring the entropy gradient",
    ", we also find these regions to be superadiabatic , confirming susceptibility to convection .",
    "we thus predict that shocks from high - mass planets produce three main features in disks : hot lobes at the locations of the lindblad resonances , strong turbulence at these radii producing substantial accretion flows , and convection far beyond the radius of the planet .",
    "we compare the maximum temperature of 450k we find in the model with that needed to explain the unpolarized bright spiral feature in hd 100546 . to determine the latter , we consider the magnitudes in the @xmath91 ( currie et al . 2015 ) and @xmath118 bands ( currie et al . 2014 ) , and fit blackbody curves to these two data points . to determine the magnitude of the spiral feature we use the quoted magnitudes of hd 100546b in currie et al .",

    "it is pertinent at this point to explicitly highlight a number of limitations of our model . in our simple approach for the cooling , radiation emitted from the hot lobes simply disappears instead of heating the overlying material .",
    "a more complete treatment is worthwhile , to see whether enough shock heat is transferred to the photosphere to be observed . for future work",
    ", we intend to do ray - tracing for short - wavelength absorption and flux - limited diffusion for long - wavelength cooling , as in flock et al .",
    "another limitation is that we smooth the planet potential at the hill radius , for numerical stability .",
    "this means that the planet potential is much shallower than in reality , so we actually underestimate the magnitude of the shocks and therefore also the temperature enhancement . reducing the amount of smoothing of the planet",
    "s potential would deepen the gravitational well and yield more heating .",
    "finally , in computing the optical depth we take the smaller of the upper and lower values , which makes the midplane cooling too slow by a factor of two .",
    "replacing @xmath125 instead by the inverse of the sum of the inverses of the lower and upper value would give a better estimate .",
    "these two corrections are in opposite directions , though , which will tend to minimize their effect .",
    "nevertheless , they should be checked in a future study .",
    "the simulations presented here were carried out using the stampede cluster of the texas advanced computing center ( tacc ) at the university of texas at austin through xsede grant tg - ast140014 .",

    "<S> recent high - resolution , near - infrared images of protoplanetary disks have shown that these disks often present spiral features . </S>",
    "<S> spiral arms are among the structures predicted decades ago by numerical simulations of disk - planet interaction and thus it is tempting to suspect that planetary perturbers are responsible for the observed signatures . however , such interpretation is not free of problems . </S>",
    "<S> the spirals are found to have large pitch angles , and in at least one case ( hd 100546 ) the spiral feature appears effectively unpolarized , which implies thermal emission of the order of 1000k ( @xmath0k at closer inspection ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently shown in two - dimensional models that shock dissipation in the supersonic wake of high - mass planets can lead to significant heating if the disk is sufficiently adiabatic . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend this analysis to three dimensions in thermodynamically evolving disks . </S>",
    "<S> we use the pencil code in spherical coordinates for our models , with a prescription for thermal cooling based on the optical depth of the local vertical gas column . </S>",
    "<S> we use a 5@xmath1 planet , and show that shocks in the region around the planet where the lindblad resonances occur heat the gas to substantially higher temperatures than the ambient disk gas at that radius . </S>",
    "<S> the gas is accelerated vertically away from the midplane by the shocks to form shock bores , and the gas falling back toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf near the lindblad resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this turbulence , although localized , has high @xmath2 values , reaching 0.05 in the inner lindblad resonance , and 0.1 in the outer one . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence that the disk regions heated up by the planetary shocks eventually becomes superadiabatic , generating convection far from the planet s orbit . </S>"
