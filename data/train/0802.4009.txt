    "there has been a wide interest in the study of the substituted perovskite - type manganites , la@xmath7a@xmath1mno@xmath3 , in order to understand the different aspects of the complex magnetic behaviour exhibited by these compounds.@xcite the double exchange interactions involving mn@xmath8 and mn@xmath9 ions give rise to ferromagnetism in the substituted manganites .",
    "the changes in the mn - o - mn bond angle , from structural distortions , are very crucial in determining the strength of the ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "highest curie temperature in the la@xmath7ca@xmath1mno@xmath3 series is obtained for @xmath5 1/3 and hence there are many studies reported for the composition la@xmath10a@xmath2mno@xmath3 .",
    "many interesting new magnetic behaviors are observed when la@xmath8 is partially substituted by other trivalent rare - earth ions in la@xmath10ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 , @xcite though there are no changes in the mn@xmath11/mn@xmath9 ratio after substitution .",
    "et al._@xcite found a direct correlation between the curie temperature and the average ionic radius of the la - site ions , where the curie temperature decreases with decreasing average ionic radius in la@xmath12r@xmath1ca@xmath13mno@xmath3 ( r = pr , y ) , indicating the role of lattice effects in determining the ferromagnetic properties .",
    "partial substitution of la by smaller ions leads to a decrease in the mn - o - mn bond angle and this affects the long range ferromagnetic exchange interactions.@xcite    for la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 ( in the reports , the chemical composition is used as ( la@xmath7tb@xmath1)@xmath10ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 ) , a gradual decrease in the curie temperature is observed with increasing concentration of tb.@xcite this is also associated with a broadening of the magnetic transition and ultimately a spin glass behaviour is observed at larger concentrations of tb .",
    "@xcite in la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 , the evolution of a spin glass ( sg ) or a cluster glass ( cg ) state is thought to be due to the competing interactions of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) types or the random distribution of mn - o - mn bond angle which suppresses the exchange strength between the mn ions significantly.@xcite at sufficiently large values of @xmath4 ( @xmath4 = 0.22 ) , short range ordered magnetic clusters are formed with typical magnetic coherence length of around 18  , at low temperatures.@xcite    the reported studies on la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 are performed on ferromagnetic compositions ( @xmath16 0.1 ) or spin glass compositions ( @xmath17 0.15 ) and therefore no information is available on the changeover region from ferromagnetic to spin glass characteristics . in order to explore the critical concentration of the tb ions which results in the formation of magnetic clusters leading to spin glass characteristics , a series of compositions with very close values of @xmath4 between 0.1 and 0.15 in la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 have been studied .",
    "the critical concentration is found to be @xmath5 1/8 , and interesting magnetic properties are observed for compositions close to the cross over region .",
    "the polycrystalline la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 compositions were synthesized by the conventional solid state route from la@xmath18o@xmath3 , tb@xmath19o@xmath20 , caco@xmath3 and mno@xmath18 by mixing these oxides in the required stoichiometry for @xmath4 = 0 , 0.03 , 0.07 , 0.10 , 0.11 , 0.12 , 0.125 , 0.13 , 0.15 , 0.20 , and 0.25 .",

    "finally the powder samples were pelletized and sintered at 1673 k for 24 h. the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction using cu k@xmath21 radiation and ni filter .",
    "the mn@xmath9 contents in the compounds were estimated by the iodometric titration method.@xcite the magnetization measurements were performed on a vibrating sample magnetometer .",

    "also , it was found that the relative susceptibility value also decreased with the increasing tb concentration .",
    "these observations point out the evolution of short range ordering due to the decreasing mn - o - mn bond angle and consequent formation of magnetic clusters as the concentration of tb is increased .",
    "this clustering is likely to be due to the breaking or weakening of the double exchange closer to the tb - sites caused by the local structural distortion and the spin glass like feature originates from the formation of such clusters .",

    "the decrease in the susceptibility below 30 k as soon as a small amount of tb is incorporated in the lattice of la@xmath10ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 has been ascribed to spin glass behavior.@xcite however , neutron diffraction studies showed ferromagnetic ordering for @xmath4 = 0.067 down to 7 k.@xcite thus , the feature at 30 k for 0.03 @xmath6 0.125 is not likely to be spin glass transition .",
    "it is possible that at small concentrations the tb@xmath8 ions are randomly distributed in the lattice , the double exchange is disturbed around the tb centers and therefore tiny magnetic clusters are formed with reduced mn - o - mn angle .",
    "these tiny magnetic clusters remain isolated until @xmath4 = 0.125 ( 1/8 ) above which larger magnetic clusters are formed due to the breaking or considerable weakening of the three dimensional long range ordering .",
    "thus , the temperature at which a decrease in the susceptibility is observed , due to these small clusters , remains the same until @xmath4 = 1/8 .",
    "the three dimensional ordering is affected when @xmath28 1/8 .",
    "however , there is another possibility that , at small concentrations , the tb ions form a tbmno@xmath3 like local environment in the lattice of la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 .",
    "for tbmno@xmath3 , an incommensurate - commensurate phase transition , which is accompanied by a ferroelectric transition , associated with a lattice modulation , is observed close to @xmath2230 k and large magnetic field controlled polarization effects are reported at this temperature .",

    "thus , at intermediate values of @xmath4 , the lattice is consisting of larger ferromagnetic clusters with sufficiently long range ordering and smaller short range ordered clusters .",

    "the magnetization remains almost the same up to @xmath4 = 0.1 and then decreases above this value of @xmath4 .",
    "also , the magnetization is not saturated for @xmath17 0.1 in the measured field range .",
    "recent studies suggest the existence of quantum critical point ( qcp ) effect in la@xmath31ca@xmath15mn@xmath7ga@xmath1o@xmath3.@xcite qcp is defined as a second order transition accompanied by the change of a non - thermal parameter .",
    "the observation of qcp in la@xmath31ca@xmath15mn@xmath7ga@xmath1o@xmath3 system is as predicted by the theoretical calculations and the qcp in this system was expected for a value of 10 - 20% of ga substitution.@xcite the substitution of a nonmagnetic ion like ga at the mn - sublattice of the perovskite - type oxide causes the localization of the electronic states suppressing the double exchange mechanism .",
    "for la@xmath31ca@xmath15mn@xmath7ga@xmath1o@xmath3 , the spontaneous magnetic moment calculated from the experimental neutron diffraction patterns recorded at 1.5 k decreased for @xmath17 0.1 and vanished for @xmath17 0.16 , indicating electron localization which suppresses the double exchange mechanism .",
    "the present dc magnetization data on la@xmath0tb@xmath1ca@xmath30mno@xmath3 shows almost a similar trend , except for the finite value of the magnetization at higher values of @xmath4 , suggesting the possible existence of qcp in this system also .",

    "= 0.2 , the behaviour is similar to that observed for some typical spin glass systems,@xcite where the virgin magnetization curve initially lies outside the loop and then merges with the loop at higher fields . on the other hand , for @xmath4 = 0.13 and 0.15 ,",
    "the entire virgin magnetization curve lies outside the hysteresis loop above a certain small field ( this small crossing field is observed for @xmath4 = 0.2 and 0.25 also , and increases with @xmath4 ) , and an anomalous step - like feature is observed in the virgin magnetization curve , similar to that of a metamagnetic transition .",
    "however , this transition is completely irreversible . the field above which a broad step is observed is larger for @xmath4 = 0.15 compared to that for @xmath4 = 0.13 .",
    "after the magnetic field is increased in the negative direction to -15 koe and when brought back to + 15 koe through h = 0 , the transition is not observed .",
    "this is an irreversible ferromagnetic transition in the sense that the step - like feature is never obtained when the measurements were repeated immediately or even after a time gap of 30 minutes . in the subsequent measurements ,",
    "the first part of the curve always lies inside the hysteresis loop , like that for the compositions for @xmath16 0.125 .",
    "it appears that an irreversible magnetic field induced phase transition is occurred .",

    "et al._@xcite explained the observations in terms of an avalanche behavior . it may be noted that the first part of the virgin curve is similar to that of the spin glass composition @xmath4 = 0.2 , in the present case , and therefore",
    ", it is possible that the second jump is due to a field induced growth of the larger ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "once the clusters are grown , it is not possible to revert back to the original state due to the unavailability of sufficient thermal energy .",
    "the original state is found only when the temperature is raised above the peak temperature and then cooled back in zero field .",
    "the present studies made on a series of close compositions in la@xmath14tb@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath3 indicate that single phase ferromagnetic compositions are possible for @xmath34 0.1 , mixed long range ordered ferromagnetic and short range ordered magnetic clusters coexist for 0.1 @xmath6 0.125 and spin glass like phases are formed for larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "the ferromagnetic clusters present in the compositions immediately above the cross over region show magnetic field induced growth and give larger magnetization at higher fields .",
