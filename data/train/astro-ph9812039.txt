    "new windows are opening in the nearly unexplored evolution of distant galaxies at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "significant progress in the knowledge of ir / submm emission of moderate  and high  redshift sources is now possible .",
    "deep surveys in the mid infrared with the infared space observatory camera ( isocam ) ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) and in the far infrared with the photometer isophot ( lemke et al .",
    "1996 ) were designed to yield strong constraints on galaxy evolution at these wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of a deep survey with isophot at @xmath2 m .    for some time",
    ", astronomers have suspected the importance of the `` optically dark '' side of galaxy evolution where stellar uv / optical light due to star formation is reprocessed to thermal radiation by dust ( for example setti and woltjer 1970 ; stecker , puget and fazio 1977 ) .",
    "the iras all - sky survey unveiled a local population of infrared galaxies ranging from normal spirals to the spectacular luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( resp .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs ) , but only a handful of these sources had a significant redshift . thus",
    ", our knowledge of the dark side of galaxy evolution has so  far been limited to local or low  redshift galaxies . at present",
    "about one third of the bolometric luminosity released by stars finally escapes galaxies at ir / submm wavelengths ( soifer and neugebauer , 1991 ) .",
    "a large fraction of this is associated with star formation . with their limited sensitivity ,",
    "deep iras surveys were unable to probe redshifts larger than @xmath3 ( ashby et al .",
    "1996 ) , although they already show a significant evolution in number counts ( see e.g. bertin et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a host of observational evidence seems to directly demonstrate the presence of dust at higher z. for instance , iras identified iras f10214 + 4724 , a very peculiar , `` hyperluminous '' galaxy at @xmath4 ( rowan  robinson et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "this object was detected by iras because it is strongly magnified by gravitational lensing ( serjeant et al .",
    "1995 , eisenhardt et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "it probably has many counterparts which are so far undetected .",
    "about twenty radiogalaxies and quasars have also been observed at submm / mm wavelengths ( see e.g. hughes et al .",
    ", 1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "although their evolutionary status is not completely understood , the most likely interpretation is that the submm emission is mostly due to dust heated by star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "a spectacular breakthrough was recently achieved with the detection of the long  sought `` cosmic infrared background '' ( hereafter cirb ) in firas residuals between 200 @xmath0 m and 2 mm ( puget et al . , 1996 ; guiderdoni et al .",
    ", 1997 , hereafter gbplh ; fixsen et al .",
    ", 1998 ; lagache et al . ,",
    "1998 ) , and in dirbe residuals at 140 and 240 @xmath0 m ( schlegel et al . , 1997 ;",
    "hauser et al . , 1998 ;",
    "dwek et al .",
    ", 1998 ; lagache et al . ,",
    "the background is produced by the line  of  sight accumulation of extragalactic sources .",
    "the level of the cirb is significantly higher than the lower limits on the `` cosmic optical background '' ( hereafter cob ) given by summing faint galaxy counts that probably lie close to convergence ( williams et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "this is a strong evidence that a significant fraction of star formation is hidden from optical observations and observable only at far infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .    with the rapid development of the case for dust at high redshift ,",
    "theoretical efforts have led to detailed modelling of spectral evolution at ir / submm wavelengths ( franceschini et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "these spectral energy distributions can be consistently implemented in the general framework of hierarchical clustering ( gbplh ; guiderdoni et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the generic prediction of these models is a high level of ir / submm emission due to the continuous formation of large galaxies through the merging of smaller ones .",
    "this model has allowed gbplh to predict the decomposition of the cirb into faint galaxy counts .",
    "a family of scenarios was generated that agree with local ir constraints ( iras luminosty functions and faint counts ) , and various levels of evolution consistent with the observed cirb in firas residuals .",
    "the authors concluded their analysis by showing that , counts at 15 @xmath0 m and 60 @xmath0 m were relatively insensitive to the details of the scenarios , but that submm counts could provide constraints strong enough to break the degeneracy .",
    "there are three reasons for this specific behaviour : ( 1 ) the rest - frame wavelength range around 100 @xmath0 m encompasses the bulk of ir emission due to star formation , while the 15 @xmath0 m band probes the fraction of radiation absorbed by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which is less directly related to the total output and thus not a reliable tracer of star formation .",
    "( 2 ) the cosmic star formation rate density directly seen at uv wavelengths strongly increases between @xmath5 and 1.5 ( lilly _ et al .",
    "it is likely that similar behaviour appears in the ir .",
    "( 3 ) because of the shape of the spectral energy distribution , the @xmath6correction is _ negative _ at 175 @xmath0 m and the detection of galaxies at @xmath7 is favoured ( blain & longair , 1996 ) .    consequently",
    ", gbplh proposed the concept of a deep isophot survey with the c160 filter ( effective wavelength 175 @xmath0 m ) . to provide sufficient constraints on the models , the exposure times per pointing had to reach @xmath8 to 20 mjy .",
    "this deep isophot survey was expected to yield a probe of galaxy evolution complementary to deep isocam surveys . in the ir range ,",
    "the iso deep surveys follow - up has given number counts at 15 @xmath9 ( oliver et al .",
    ", 1997 ; dsert et al . , 1998 ;",
    "aussel et al . ,",
    "1998 ) and 7 @xmath9 ( taniguchi et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "kawara et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have conducted a deep survey at 175 @xmath9 in the lockman hole region . at the other end of the submillimetre decade , the first deep survey obtained with scuba on the jcmt has also unveiled a population of submm sources with number counts much larger than the no  evolution predictions ( smail et al . , 1997,1998 ; hughes et al .",
    ", 1998 ; barger et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "herein we present the first results of this isophot survey as implemented in the marano field .",
    "an area of 0.25 square degree was covered and a detection level of @xmath10100 mjy ( 5@xmath11 ) was reached .",
    "as anticipated from the level of the cirb , a large number of sources was found , much larger than the predictions based on iras luminosity functions without strong evolution .",
    "section 3 summarizes our observations .",
    "section 4 explains the data reduction and calibration methods .",
    "section 5 gives the resulting maps and source catalogs .",
    "these results are discussed in section 6 , which compares the observed number counts with model predictions and iras 60 @xmath9 counts .",
    "section 7 provides our provisional conclusions .",
    "forthcoming papers in this series will present the complete survey , elaborate the constraints on the models and detail the identification and follow - up strategy and results .",
    "the observations were performed at an effective wavelength of 175@xmath9 with the c200 array ( 2x2 pixels ) of isophot .",
    "the pixel field of view is 1.5 arcmin .",
    "the aot pht22 was used with the c160 filter .",
    "the observations consist of four 19x19 rasters centred on ( ra , dec ) in j2000 equal to ( 03h13m25.6s , -55d03m43.9s ) , ( 03h13m9.6s , -55d01m26.0s ) , ( 03h12m53.6s , -55d03m43.9s ) and ( 03h13m9.6s , -55d06m25.4s ) respectively .",
    "each raster was performed in the spacecraft ( y , z ) coordinate system which is parallel to the edges of the detector array . the field area covered by each raster",
    "is about 30x30. the exposure time is 16s per pixel .",
    "rasters were performed with one pixel overlap in both y and z direction .",
    "therefore , for the maximum redundancy region , the effective exposure time is 256 sec per sky position ( 16 sec per pixel , 4 rasters and redundancy of 4 ) .",
    "displacements between the four raster centers correspond to 2 pixels .",
    "this mode of observation , which does not provide proper sampling of the point - spread - function ( psf ) , was chosen to assess the reliability of faint source observations with isophot at a time when this was in question .",
    "we use pia , the isophot interactive analysis software version 6.4 ( gabriel et al . , 1997 ) , to correct for instrumental effects , the glitches induced by cosmic particles and to provide an initial calibration .",
    "first we apply the non - linearity correction due to 2 independent effects : the non - linearity of the cold readout electronics and the downward curving ramp due to de - biasing .",
    "deglitching is performed for each individual ramp and then the mean signal per position is derived by averaging the linear fit on each ramp ( see gabriel et al . , 1997 for details ) .",
    "the signal shows a long term drift which is corrected by using the two internal calibration ( fcs ) measurements bracketing each individual observation . inside each raster",
    ", the long term drift represents less than 10@xmath1 of the signal .",
    "the calibration is performed by deriving the mean value of the two fcs measurements .",
    "the contribution of the long term drift is thus lower than 5@xmath1 .",
    "flat fielding is achieved using the high redundancy in the measurements : we compare the fluxes over all positions ( which have a redudancy of 4 ) and derive the difference in responsivity between the four pixels for each raster .",
    "glitches inducing long term drifts are also corrected .",
    "the flux is finally projected on a 5``x5 '' coordinate grid using our own projection procedure .",
    "we compare the average surface brightness as given by piav6.4 with that derived from an interpolation of dirbe data at 100 , 140 and 240@xmath9 .",
    "the value found by pia is a factor 2.5 greater than that from dirbe .",
    "this discrepancy results mainly from the fact that the solid angle used for the extended source calibration in piav6.4 is the solid angle of one pixel and not the integral of the point spread function ( psf ) . when the solid angle is computed using the psf wing measurements on saturn ( toth et al . , 1997 )",
    ", it is equal to 2.2 times the solid angle of the pixel .",
    "the psf determined in this way is shown fig .",
    "when we correct the pia calibration by this factor , this leads to a calibration difference with dirbe of only @xmath12 , well within the combined uncertainties of the phot point source calibration and the solid angle .",
    "we conclude that the phot calibration established with strong sources can be extrapolated to lower fluxes , such as the flux from the background , but that the proper psf must be taken into account . in the present work ,",
    "we thus adopt a calibration based on the dirbe fluxes .",
    "errors estimates given by the pia are much smaller than the systematic errors .",
    "the two mains ones are the photometric calibration uncertainty itself , which can not be larger than 15@xmath1 on the basis of the good agreement with the dirbe brightness , and the uncertainty on the psf .",
    "the psf we use is based on the saturn measurements and differs from the models ( used in the most recent version of the pia ) by a factor around 1.3 .",
    "alltogether , for point sources , we thus estimate an uncertainty of about 30 @xmath1 .",
    "= 8.cm = 7.cm",
    "2 shows 4 images each made from one individual raster .",
    "the comparison of these images shows a high degree of correlation .",
    "the same large scale structure is seen in the four rasters .",
    "this structure corresponds to the edge of a cirrus cloud already detected with iras data at 100 micron ( fig .",
    "smaller structures are also very well reproduced in the four rasters .",
    "these small scale structures are due to the combination of point sources , the background of unresolved sources and cirrus fluctuations .",
    "differences between independent raster maps yield a residual rms fluctuation of 0.055 mjy / sr .",
    "this leads to a noise in the final four coadded maps 2@xmath13 times smaller or 1.96 10@xmath14 mjy / sr ( 3.7 mjy per 92 \" pixel ) which is representative of the detector noise , but only an upper limit since it includes some residual differences in the response between individual rasters .",
    "the brightness variations in the maps have a rms value of 0.13 mjy / sr and are probably dominated by the cirrus component .",
    "cirrus clouds are known to have a steep power spectrum ( gautier et al . , 1992 ) proportional to @xmath15 and thus gives strong brightness variations only at large scales .",
    "the brightness is on average equal to 3.16 mjy / sr and varies from 2.9 to 3.3 mjy / sr for the diffuse emission .",
    "this brightness is composed of an extragalactic background of 1 mjy / sr ( lagache et al . , 1998 ) , zodiacal emission around 0.7 mjy / sr ( based on the w.t .",
    "reach model , private communication ) and cirrus of around 1.46 mjy / sr .",
    "most of the large scale variations is attributed to the cirrus component which varies from 1.2 and 1.6 mjy / sr .",
    "point - like sources are also clearly visible .",
    "= 18.cm = 25.cm    = 22.cm = 16.cm    we extract these sources by comparing the contrast between each pixel on the sky with the surrounding ones .",
    "we keep only sources for which the contrast is greater than 0.03 mjy / sr , the signal to noise ratio greater than 3 and sources seen in at least 3 rasters in the region of maximum redundancy ( observed 4 times ) and in all rasters available for regions on the edges .",
    "the main limitation to the photometry of these sources is the poor psf sampling .",
    "the determination of the flux is done by using only the central part of the psf .",
    "we do aperture photometry ; we derive the flux within an inner radius of 60 `` and remove a reference background computed between the inner radius of 60  and an outer radius of 92 '' . with the psf such as the one displayed in fig.1 ,",
    "the reference background is strongly contaminated by the source .",
    "the total flux from a source is 4.75 times the measured one obtained with the procedure described just above .",
    "furthermore , the fluxes are also multiplied by 1.1 to correct for the transient effect estimated to be about @xmath16 .",
    "thus , all the measured fluxes ( and therefore the noise mesurements ) must be multiplied by 4.75 and 1.1 .",
