    "this paper presents a continuation of a study of the dwarf galaxy populations in a variety of environments within the local supercluster ( trentham , tully , & verheijen 2001 ; trentham & tully 2002 [ tt02 ] ; mahdavi , trentham , & tully 2005 [ mtt05 ] ) .",
    "our goals are to give better precision to the properties of the luminosity function of galaxies at faint levels and to determine the nature of any variations with environment .",
    "our earlier observations affirmed the claims of a deficiency of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies compared with the large number of low - mass dark - matter halos predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "the discrepancy is large ",
    "more than one order of magnitude  and potentially a problem for cdm theory .",
    "these studies also point towards a situation where there are more low - luminosity dwarf galaxies per high - luminosity giant galaxy in dense clusters than in the field .",
    "this discrepancy is much weaker : studies of the virgo cluster ( e.g.  trentham and hodgkin 2002 ) showed that there are about twice as many dwarf galaxies per giant there than in the field .",
    "there is an upturn in the cluster luminosity function at @xmath7 that is not seen in the field luminosity function .",
    "interestingly this upturn has also been seen in a large study of rich clusters using sdss data ( popessa et al .",
    "the virgo data is deep enough and the cluster is near enough that we can see the luminosity function begin to flatten again at about @xmath8 .",
    "there are a number of physical processes during galaxy formation which could generate the observed phenomena .",
    "for example , the suppression of the formation of low - mass galaxies may be a strong function of the state of the intergalactic medium . at later times , after reionization , the intergalactic medium is too hot to permit the collapse of gas into any small dark - matter halos that may form . if gas must be cold to accumulate , there will be more dwarfs per giant in any part of the universe where galaxies form early , for example , galaxy clusters .",
    "another mechanism might be the pressure - confinement of gas within galaxies by an intracluster medium .",
    "this would reduce the feedback effects of supernova - driven winds in low - mass galaxies in galaxy clusters , where such a medium is present . yet",
    "another mechanism would be the inability of giant galaxies to consume dwarfs in galaxy clusters , where the velocity dispersion is high .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation that investigate the roles of these different physical processes are limited by a lack of observational data , and it is this deficiency that our study attempts to address .",
    "our plan is to measure the galaxy luminosity function to faint limits in environments that have had different formation histories .",
    "the availability of large format digital detectors provides an opportunity to gather much better statistics on the occurrence of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the present study is based on observations with the canada - france - hawaii telescope 12k detector , the predecessor of the current megacam ccd mosaic ( aune et al .",
    "the ultimate intention is to survey a representative sample of nearby groups and clusters that span wide ranges of density and mass .",
    "mtt05 presented results on the first region to be fully surveyed in our program , the intermediate mass but dense ngc  5846 group .",
    "small , dense groups were observed earliest in the program for the practical reason that they subtend modest areas on the sky .",
    "more extended groups have subsequently been observed with the larger format megacam at cfht and the results from these studies will follow .",
    "the current study concerns an unusual group in the context of the local supercluster region .",
    "the group of galaxies centered on ngc  1407 is sparse in luminous systems , but its velocity dispersion is high , and the group appears to be dynamically evolved .",
    "it shares the properties of ` fossil ' groups ( ponman et al .",
    "it fails slightly to meet the formal qualification for such a group that there be a differential of at least 2 magnitudes between the brightest and second brightest objects since the interval between ngc  1407 and ngc  1400 is only 1.4 magnitudes . in any event , among structures with @xmath9",
    "km  s@xmath6 the ngc",
    "1407 group is extreme .",
    "this small group of e and s0 galaxies dominated by ngc  1407 has attracted attention because of a suspected high mass - to - light ratio @xmath10 ( gould 1993 ; quintana , fouqu , and way 1994 ) .",
    "the group velocity dispersion based on 35 measurements is @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the mass of the group found from application of the virial theorem is @xmath12 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath13 band is then @xmath4 .",
    "astonishingly , the second brightest galaxy in the group , ngc  1400 , is _ blueshifted _ by @xmath14  km  s@xmath6 with respect to the group mean of 1630  km  s@xmath6 , a line - of - sight velocity excursion of @xmath15 .",
    "if the 3d velocity dispersion is proportional to the projected excursion and mass is distributed like the light , then 75 per cent of the orbital kinetic energy of the group would be attributed to this one galaxy .",
    "this circumstance is unlikely .",
    "the most plausible resolution is that most of the mass is in an extended group halo and that ngc  1400 is akin to a test particle of negligible mass , presently near the potential minimum and directed close to our line of sight .",
    "surface brightness fluctuation measurements ( tonry et al . 2001 ) assure that ngc  1400 is indeed at the same distance as ngc  1407 .",
    "note that this reasonably direct inference that most of the group mass is decoupled from the light strongly negates the hypothesis of modified newtonian gravity ( milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "the existence of groups with such high mass - to - light ratios is reasonable in the context of @xmath16cdm cosmology ( see gao et al .",
    "2004 for a description of some of the important physical processes ) . that the group around ngc 1407 is an example of such a group comes mainly from dynamical evidence ,",
    "of which the relative velocity of ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 is the most striking . given that surface brightness fluctuations place these two early - type galaxies at the same distance , the probability of their _ not _ being bound is extremely small .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to recognize the alternative ( although we believe less likely ) possibility that ngc 1400 has a high velocity relative to ngc 1407 because it is passing through the group , maybe for the first time .    the ngc  1407 group resembles but is more extreme than the ngc  5846 group discussed by mtt05 .",
    "the ngc  5846 group is a dumbbell system of @xmath17 arranged about two dominant ellipticals .",
    "the ngc  1407 group has essentially as much mass but with a tighter concentration around the central large elliptical and an even greater predominance of early - type galaxies .",
    "these characteristics lead us to identify the structure as akin to a `` fossil group '' , an entity at an advanced dynamical stage . after a search for small groups dominated by an elliptical at least 2 magnitudes brighter than any companion , khosroshahi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) identified the group around ngc  6482 at @xmath18  km  s@xmath6 as the nearest entity to satisfy the ` fossil ' criterion .",
    "the ngc  1407 group at @xmath19  km  s@xmath6 does not quite satisfy the magnitude differential criterion but it is the most extreme structure of a similar nature within 2000  km  s@xmath6 . another difference between this group and fossil groups concerns large - scale environment ; the ngc 1407 group exists in a richer supercluster environment than most fossil groups .",
    "given these differences it would not be correct to refer to this group as a fossil group .",
    "nevertheless it is intriguing that such a nearby group shares so many properties with these rare objects .",
    "0.75 mm @xmath20    this is the designation given in the _ nearby galaxies catalog _ ( tully 1988 ) .      before studying the group properties , we need to look in some detail at the region of sky around the group because of concerns regarding projection contamination .",
    "the ngc  1407 group , 51 - 8 in the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully 1988 ) , is 18 degrees ( @xmath21  mpc ) away in projection from the fornax cluster ( 51 - 1 ) .",
    "it is part of the eridanus cloud which contains other knots of early type systems in the vicinity .",
    "the extended region called 51 - 4 containing the dominant galaxies ngc 1332 , 1371 , 1395 , and 1398 is 23  mpc removed in projection and 300  km  s@xmath6 blueshifted in the mean .",
    "the eridanus region excluding the ngc  1407 group must contain at least @xmath22 ( the combination of groups 51 - 4,5,7 in table 1 of tully 2005 ) .",
    "though the ngc  1407 group appears distinct today it must be strongly suspected that the entire core of the eridanus cloud is bound with over @xmath23 and will ultimately merge .",
    "the first two figures provide information about the group environment .",
    "figure  1 is a histogram of all known velocities within 10,000  km  s@xmath6 in the projected area shown in figure  2 .",
    "the histogram reveals that two structures , the eridanus cloud and the southern wall , dominate the field in the region of interest .",
    "there is no known contamination foreground of the eridanus cloud and there is a void behind eridanus that extends to the southern wall .",
    "the southern wall is 2.5 times more distant so its members are about 2 mag fainter than the equivalent galaxies in eridanus .",
    "-4 mm    -3 mm    the two panels of fig .  2",
    "show the distribution of galaxies with known velocities in the eridanus cloud and the near - background .",
    "the 514 group containing ngc  1395 is seen to be nearby but distinct .",
    "the ngc  1407 group is contiguous with the other components of the eridanus cloud but there is no suggestion of confusion .",
    "overwhelmingly , candidates within the survey region are early types but most galaxies outside a few discrete knots in eridanus are late morphological types , very few of which are projected into the survey region .",
    "we do , however , note an unfortunate instance of projection .",
    "three s0 galaxies ( ngc  1394 the brightest ) in a knot within the southern wall lie near the middle of the cfht survey region .",
    "these galaxies are clearly distinguished as background by their velocities , and are not part of the eridanus cloud described in the previous paragraph . in the current study",
    ", we must give consideration to the possibility that low - surface - brightness companions to these systems could enter our list of ngc  1407 group candidates .",
    "more distant galaxies are expected to be excluded from our candidate list by the procedures described in section 4 .",
    "the x - ray - emitting medium in clusters of galaxies is an important tracer of the overall matter distribution .",
    "unfortunately , in groups of galaxies the surface brightness is so low relative to the x - ray background that the emission can rarely be detected beyond a few tenths of a virial radius .",
    "the ngc 1407 galaxy was observed by the einstein ( dressler & wilson 1985 ) , rosat ( davis & white 1996 ) , asca ( buote & fabian 1998 ) , and chandra ( zhang & xu 2004 ) x - ray telescopes . the chandra observation , which has the best spatial resolution , shows a diffuse x - ray - emitting medium with temperature 0.7 kev and metal abundance about 0.4 solar , a weak central agn and 40 x - ray point sources , most of which are x - ray binaries .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the diffuse component is @xmath24 erg s@xmath6 in the 0.310 kev band .",
    "the ngc 1407 group is then underluminous by an order of magnitude given the expected value from the x - ray luminosity - temperature and luminosity - velocity dispersion relations ( mahdavi & geller 2001 , osmond & ponman 2004 ) .    because the system is so nearby , the asca and chandra observations of ngc 1407 include little of the group - scale emission outside the central galaxy .",
    "the wider field of the rosat pspc detector was able to capture some of this group - scale emission with a resolution of @xmath25 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) use a @xmath26-model to determine a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath27 erg s@xmath6 within 570 kpc , which puts the ngc 1407 group directly on the x - ray luminosity - temperature and luminosity - velocity dispersion relations ( rather than making it underluminous , as do the chandra data ) .",
    "one caveat is that an extrapolated @xmath26-model can overestimate the gas density at the largest radii ( markevitch et al .",
    "it seems that the ngc 1407 group is not an x - ray _ overluminous _ system of galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast to the average fossil group , which is overluminous in the x - ray relative to a non - fossil counterpart of the same mass ( khosroshahi et al .",
    "2004 ; donghia et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the rosat data also show significant x - ray emission associated with ngc 1400 and with the probable member dwarf galaxy leda 074845 . fitting a mekal thermal plasma model to these peaks , we find that the emission in both the peaks comes from gas with the same temperature and metallicity as the gas around ngc 1407 .",
    "the resulting 0.1 - 10 kev x - ray fluxes are @xmath28 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath29 for ngc 1400 and @xmath30 erg s@xmath6 @xmath29 for leda 074845 .",
    "we have submitted an xmm - newton proposal to further investigate the nature of the puzzling emission near leda 074845 .",
    "to our knowledge this is the second reported detection of x - ray emission from ngc 1400other reports , e.g. canizares et al .",

    "( 1999 ) have been upper limits but osullivan , forbes and ponman ( 2001 ) report a detection of this galaxy .    outside the region shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the rosat all sky survey shows a lack of x - ray emission from galaxies associated with the ngc 1407 group ( or any other group ) . within 0.9 mpc ( @xmath31 ) of ngc 1407 , there are no galaxies , groups , or clusters with @xmath32 km s@xmath6 that have detectable x - ray emission .",

    "in retrospect , we fail slightly to fully cover that region and a small correction for incompletion will be described .",
    "we undertook observations using the blue side of the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris : oke et al .",

    "data were acquired on 27 november , 2003 .",
    "observations were affected by extensive cirrus and we obtained spectra for only four galaxies . all turned out to be group members .",
    "one , n1407041 , also known as apmuk b03381296 - 184859.2 , is revealed to be a second case with a very large blueshift ( @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 with respect to the group mean ) .",
    "it s location in close proximity to ngc  1407 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "our ultimate intention is to get a listing of group members that is as complete as possible .",
    "an unambiguous way to establish membership is to measure a velocity , but velocities can only be obtained for the brighter galaxies .",
    "we therefore need to rely on other information to evaluate whether a galaxy lies in the group or not .",
    "dwarf galaxies have low surface brightnesses .",
    "if we see a low - surface - brightness galaxy in the direction of the group of a type that we do not see in blank fields , there is a high probability that this galaxy is a low - luminosity member of the group as opposed to a high - luminosity background galaxy .",
    "other information , such as galaxy morphology , can also be useful .",
    "for example , if the low - surface - brightness galaxy exhibits spiral structure , it is probably a luminous background galaxy so there is a low probability that it is a dwarf group member .",
    "morphology assessments are subjective but their reliability can be tested . for an extensive discussion of the issues involved with the discovery and confirmation of dwarf galaxies , see flint at al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "a search of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) reveals 29 galaxies in our survey area have known velocities less than 3000  km s@xmath6 .",
    "two additional galaxies have velocities within this limit in the second 6 degree field ( 6df ) data release ( jones et al .",
    "our keck observations gave velocities for four more galaxies , all of which were in the group .",
    "consequently there are now a total of 35 group members with known velocities , including almost all candidate members brighter than @xmath38 .",
    "the rms velocity dispersion for these galaxies is @xmath39  km s@xmath6 .",
    "the projected harmonic mean radius of all group candidates is 446 kpc .",
    "these quantities lead to a virial mass of @xmath40 . from this survey we measure a total group @xmath13 band luminosity of @xmath41 .",
    "the mass to light ratio is then very large : @xmath4 .",
    "we are faced with the problem of establishing membership for galaxies that are too faint to be amenable to spectroscopy .",
    "the uncertainties brought about by a purely staristical background subtraction are large and that is why we can not use this technique . in the 10.05 square degree survey area , we expect about 50 candidate members with @xmath42 , based on knowledge of the field luminosity function ( the uncertainty in this function corresponds to about a factor of two in this context ) . in this same 10.05 square degrees of sky , we expect to find about 20,000 background galaxies in this magnitude interval ( see for example figure 6 of trentham 1997 ) .",
    "the poisson uncertainty in this number of background galaxies is about 140 but the primary source of uncertainty is large - scale structure along the line of sight .",
    "the precise uncertainty depends on exactly where we are looking , but for an area of this size , we would expect a field - to - field variance in the background counts of several times the poisson uncertainty , about several hundred galaxies .",
    "it will therefore not be possible to identify members at any satisfactory level of significance without some other criterion .",
    "our strategy has been to study such nearby groups that the commonly known dwarf galaxies would all be very well resolved and distinguishable from background galaxies based on surface brightness and morphological criteria . admittedly , ultracompact dwarfs would excape our attention but so far there is no indication that such high - surface - brightness objects have significant impact on counts at the faint end of the luminosity function . initially in our program we had no proof that our methodology was valid . however , the analysis of the ngc 5846 group gave us assurance that our selection criteria were working well .",
    "we had complete spectroscopic coverage to @xmath43 and sampled coverage to @xmath44 .",
    "we have no proof that our selection criteria are working below this limit but fainter galaxies have even lower mean surface brightnesses and we feel that they separate very well from the background down to @xmath45 .",
    "below that limit the dimensions of the candidates get sufficiently small that confusion with the background becomes possible .",
    "following tt02 and mtt05 , we estimate that there is an appreciable probability of membership if the inner ( icp ) and outer ( ocp ) concentration parameters obey the following criteria for bright ( @xmath46 ) galaxies : @xmath47 and @xmath48 for faint ( @xmath49 ) galaxies we think that there is an appreciable probability of membership if the galaxy consists of more than three seeing disks with surface brightness @xmath50 mag arcsec@xmath51 .",
    "these criteria follow from the properties of nearby low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "tt02 show how these selection rules favor inclusion of dwarfs and exclusion of background galaxies .",
    "all galaxies that meet the selection criteria were examined by eye .",
    "we lowered our assessment of the probability of membership if we could see any spiral structure or if the galaxy was very flat , these being properties normally found among high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "for each galaxy , we assigned a rating that describes our assessment of the membership probability ( e.g .",
    "the ratings have the following meanings : `` 0 '' : membership confirmed from optical or hi spectroscopic data ; `` 1 '' : probable member , but no spectroscopic or hi detection in the literature ; `` 2 '' : possibly a member , but conceivably background ; `` 3 '' : plausibly a member ; `` 4 '' : passes icp / ocp surface brightness test but almost certainly background given the morphology of the galaxy and the properties of the background fields studied at various stages during this project ; `` 5 '' : fails icp / ocp surface brightness test . the vast majority ( several thousand with @xmath52 ) of galaxies",
    "were rated 5 .",
    "the discussion below will point out that the vocabulary ` possible ' and ` plausible ' were too conservative .",
    "almost all ` possible ' candidates turn out to be members and a substantial fraction of ` plausible ' candidates are members .",
    "the analysis of the ngc  5846 group by mtt05 has strengthened the basis of the qualitative ratings .",
    "that group has the fortune to lie in a part of the sky with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopy , which provides essentially complete velocity information to @xmath53 .",
    "our own keck lris observations provided scattered velocity information to @xmath54 . as a result",
    "we could investigate membership issues with an extensive sample of 85 velocities .",
    "the investigation was augmented by a correlation analysis of the sort that will be described for the current data in the next section .",
    "the analysis carried out on the ngc  5846 group is directly relevant to the current situation because the two groups are morphologically similar , they are at almost the same distances , and they have been observed with the same instrument and analyzed with the same procedures",
    ".    the conclusions reached in mtt05 are that essentially all targets rated 1 and 2 are true group members and that essentially all targets rated 4 are in the background . concerning objects rated 3 , mtt05 concluded that 70% of those brighter than @xmath55 ( were they they to lie at the group distance ) are members , 50% of early - type galaxies fainter than this limit are members , and none of the late - type galaxies fainter than this limit are members .",
    "we will review these conclusions in the light of the new ngc  1407 group observations .",
    "our recipe for identifying group members fails for high surface brightness objects .",
    "the extensive sdss spectroscopic observations of the ngc  5846 region confirmed membership for a small number of high surface brightness ellipticals in the regime @xmath56 , including a system quite similar to the unusual local group member m32 .",
    "interestingly , the three most extreme high surface brightness objects in that group are all in close proximity to the dominant elliptical ngc  5846 which suggests they may be tidally truncated .",
    "spectroscopy , therefore , provides a useful complement to our procedures , and a survey to a faint limit around ngc  1407 would probably pick up a few currently unsuspected group members .",
    "compact objects have been identified through spectroscopy in other dense groups ( phillipps et al .",
    "2001 ) but they have not been found in numbers that impact on the luminosity function .    on occasion",
    "we misidentify objects as background galaxies on morphological grounds .",
    "an example is the case of n5846256 = cgcg  021 - 013 in mtt05 .",
    "its velocity places it inside the group , but the object looks like a background giant galaxy because it has a substantial dust lane .",
    "another example is the nucleated dwarf elliptical n1407044 = lsbg  f549 - 036 in the current sample because this galaxy is so flat that we thought it was a background disk galaxies with a bulge .",
    "galaxies like this are extremely rare but it is possible that a small number of the galaxies we rated `` 4 '' are actually members .",
    "it is useful to make a comparison with the more sensitive study of the central part of the ngc  1407 group reported by tt02 , based on subaru 8 m observations . in figure  4",
    ", we show the difference between the magnitudes derived from that survey and from the current study .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the subaru magnitudes are systematically brighter .",
    "both studies measure the magnitude above the sky of each galaxy .",
    "the subaru photometry is deeper so the magnitudes represent total light within a fainter isophote . for both datasets",
    "the median sky brightness was 20.6 mag arcsec@xmath36 .",
    "for the subaru data the @xmath57 noise within a 0.202 arcsec square pixel was about 26 mag arcsec@xmath36 but it was 25 mag arcsec@xmath36 within a 0.206 arcsec square pixel for the shallower cfht data . in principle , we could fit exponential disk profiles to the cfht images and extrapolate to determine total magnitudes but uncertainties for these extremely low surface brightness galaxies would be large ( tully et al .",

    "-4 mm    -3 mm    the following few galaxies drew attention with this comparison between the cfht and subaru data :    * n1407 - 078 = tt02:15 * : this compact elliptical was rated 5 in the current data and 3 in the subaru data , which is surprising since most objects tend to be a bit more diffuse in the shallower cfht data .    *",

    "there is no reliable information that contradicts the conclusions of mtt05 drawn from the ngc  5846 group analysis that systems rated 1 or 2 are very likely to be group members and that systems rated 4 are very likely to be background .",
    "we find that the background contamination within the sample of early - type objects rated 3 is a bit smaller in the ngc  1407 group ( @xmath67 ) than in the ngc  5846 group ( @xmath68 depending on luminosity ) .",
    "the late - type dwarfs are more weakly correlated but we can not decide whether that is due to contamination or a consequence of an intrinsically weaker correlation ( as could arise if late types arrived more recently in the group ) .",

    "this is a particularly useful exercise because ( a ) the two groups are at similar distance , ( b ) observations of both were with the same cfht camera for the same exposure times and reductions for both were analyzed with the same algorithms , and ( c ) the groups are very similar in dimensions , velocity dispersions ( hence masses ) and morphological compositions .",
    "the luminosity functions of the two groups are shown in figure  12 , separately through the small symbols and jointly through the large symbols .",

    "it is seen that the bright end break does not quite have @xmath113 significance for either the combined ngc  1407/5846 or u  ma samples .",
    "it may seem that the virgo and ngc  1407/5846 samples have different slopes but the apparent difference is largely a consequence of the coupling between the parameters @xmath112 and @xmath111 and the clear requirement of a lower @xmath112 with the virgo data .",

    "we now show that this group possesses many dwarf galaxies , another similarity with fossil groups ( ponman et al .",

    ", the presence of a substantial dwarf elliptical population could well be a ubiquitous feature of dynamically evolved environments .    by comparison",
    ", the ngc  5846 group studied by mtt05 appears to be younger .",

    "the zero velocity or first turnaround surface at radius @xmath118 enclosing the bound region of this association can be estimated by scaling from the local group ( tully 2005 ) : @xmath119 a circle of this radius projected onto the eridanus region encloses most of the galaxies plotted in the left panel of fig .",

    "the ngc  1407 group ( 51 - 8 in the nbg catalog ) appears at the moment to be the dominant mass component but the group around ngc  1395 and ngc  1398 is slightly more luminous and contains many more intermediate luminosity galaxies .",
    "the ngc  1407 group may be close to a fossil group today but it will be reinvigorated with new group members in the future .    the very high relative motion of ngc  1400 is a special feature of the ngc  1407 group .",
    "the existence of a second highly blueshifted object , albeit a much less luminous system , shows that the motion of ngc  1400 is not an unique event .",
    "both high velocity systems are very near to ngc  1407 and the center of the group .",
    "this lends additional support for the scenario advocated by gould ( 1993 ) : that there exists a very massive gravitational well around ngc  1407 . in the context of the alternative model",
    "described earlier , the second blueshifted galaxy is a companion that is bound to ngc  1400 as both move past the group .",
    "while there are certainly more dwarf galaxies in dense environments than in diffuse environments , there still appear to be fewer dwarf galaxies than low - mass dark matter subhalos ( de lucia et al .",
    "this tells us that whatever physical processes are responsible for the suppression of star formation in low - mass galaxies must operate less efficiently in clusters than in the field or that there are additional processes that operate in clusters or regions that evolve into clusters that cause the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
