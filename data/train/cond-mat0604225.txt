    "of interest to anglers seeking to fill their creels and children seeking to fasten their shoes , a wide audience has found knots compelling from time immemorial . in the scientific community ,",
    "knots have been featured in initial formulations of the nature of atoms , @xcite ( see a popular historical account in @xcite ) , the formulation of certain path integrals , @xcite , and also in quantitative biology , where knots have been observed in , @xcite , and tied into , dna , @xcite , where the space of knots is biologically created and manipulated @xcite .",
    "knots also have been observed occasionally in proteins , @xcite .",
    "historically , the classification of knots and study of knot invariants were the first subjects of knot theory @xcite , and this remains in the center of attention among knot theorists of mathematical orientation @xcite .",
    "another fundamental aspect of knot theory is that of knot entropy .",
    "physically , this group of problems comes to the fore in the context of polymers and biophysics .",
    "mathematically , this issue belongs to both topology and probability theory and seems to remain underappreciated in the mathematics and mathematical physics community .",
    "even the simplest question in this area is poorly understood : what is the probability that a randomly closed loop in @xmath5 will be topologically equivalent to plane circle ?",
    "in other words , using professional parlance of the field , what is the probability that random loop is a trivial knot ( unknot ) , @xmath6 ?",
    "there are , of course , many more questions along the same lines , e.g. , what are probabilities of other more complex knots ? what is the entropic response of a topologically constrained loop to various perturbations , etc .",
    "most of what we know about these `` probabilistic topology '' questions is learned from computer simulations . in particular , it has been observed by many authors over the last 3 decades @xcite that the trivial knot probability depends on the length of the loop , decaying exponentially with the number of segments in the loop , @xmath0 : @xmath7 for some lattice models this exponential law , in the @xmath8 asymptotics , was also mathematically proven @xcite .",
    "it was also noticed @xcite that the same exponential law , with the same decay parameter @xmath2 , also describes the large @xmath0 asymptotical tail of the abundance of any other particular knot - although for complex knots exponential decay starts only at sufficiently large @xmath0 ( as soon as the given knot can be identified as an underknot @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative view of formula ( [ eq : triv_p ] ) , useful in the context of thermodynamics , implies that the removal of all knots from the loop is associated with thermodynamically additive ( linear in @xmath0 ) entropy loss of @xmath9 per segment ; in other words , at the temperature @xmath10 , untying all knots would require mechanical work of at least @xmath11 per segment .",
    "another manifestation of the importance of the @xmath2 parameter was found in the recent series of works @xcite .",
    "these works belong to the direction @xcite addressing the spatial statistics of polymer loops restricted to remain in a certain topological knot state .",
    "it turns out that even for loops with no excluded volume and thus are not self - avoiding , @xmath2 marks the crossover scale between mostly gaussian ( @xmath12 ) and significantly non - gaussian ( @xmath13 ) statistics .",
    "indeed , at @xmath12 , locking the loop in the state of an unknot excludes only a small domain of the conformational space which produces only marginal ( albeit non - trivial @xcite ) corrections to gaussian statistics - for instance , mean - squared gyration radius of the loop is nearly linear in @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , at @xmath13 , the topological constraints are of paramount importance , making the loop statistics very much non - gaussian , and consistent with effective self - avoidance @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the parameter @xmath2 might hold the key to the entire problem of knot entropy .",
    "we therefore decided to look at this parameter more closely in this paper .",
    "present understanding of the values of @xmath2 is quite modest .",
    "first , the constant s value was invariably found to be quite large , around @xmath14 for all examined models of `` thin '' loops with no excluded volume , or no self - avoidance @xcite .",
    "second , it is known that knots are dramatically suppressed for `` thick '' self - avoiding polymers , which means that @xmath2 rapidly increases with the radius of self - avoidance @xcite .",
    "the latter issue is also closely connected to the probabilities of knots in lattice models , where the non - zero effective self - avoidance parameter is automatically set by the lattice geometry . in the present paper",
    ", we will only consider the arguably more fundamental case of loops with no self - avoidance .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the observation that @xmath2 appears to be noticeably different for two standard polymer models for which common sense suggests that they should be equivalent .",
    "both models can be called freely - jointed in the sense that they consist of @xmath0 rigid segments with free rotation in the joints . however , in one model all segment vectors are of the same length , while in the other model segment vectors are taken from a gaussian distribution . the motivation to consider the gaussian distributed step vectors comes from the idea of decimation , or renormalization",
    ": we can start from the loop with @xmath15 segments of equal length and then group them into @xmath16 blobs of @xmath17 bare segments , each blob having nearly gaussian distributed end - to - end vector . with respect to the knot abundance , the fixed length model was examined in @xcite and the gaussian model in @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that @xmath2 for the gaussian distributed steps was larger than for identical steps , assuming no self - exclusion in both cases .",
    "no attention was paid to this observation , possibly because there was no confidence that the observed difference is real , in the context of the numerical error bars in the pertinent measurements .",
    "recently , @xcite , more detailed data became available which suggest that indeed @xmath2 is different for the two models , with fixed or gaussian distributed steplength .",
    "a similar result was independently obtained by vologodskii @xcite .",
    "latter in this article , we present even better quality data supporting the same observation that @xmath2 is different for these two models .",
    "this is a rather disturbing observation .",
    "indeed , the idea of universality in polymer physics @xcite suggests that there should not be any difference between these two models as far as any macroscopic quantity is concerned .",
    "for instance , not only is the mean squared gyration radius the same for both models , but even the distribution of the gyration radii are the same , except far into the tails .",
    "in general , the difference between polymer models of this type becomes significant only in the strong stretching regime @xcite or at high density @xcite . even if one takes into account the idea that knots , when present , are most likely localized along the chain @xcite , it is unclear how this fact can manifest itself for the loop that has no knots .",
    "thinking generally about the loop models with fixed or gaussian steplength , our reaction to this discrepancy is to realize that the major difference between the two freely - jointed loop models is that the gaussian model may have a few unusually long segments , suppressing the ability of other shorter segments to wind around , and thus decreasing the possibility for knots to occur , and accordingly , increasing @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the ability to take long strides might account for the comparative slowness of the ensemble of loops with gaussian steplengths to diversify their knot spectrum with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to investigate this conjecture .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows . after a brief description of our computational algorithms used to generate closed loops and to identify their topologies ( section [ sec : methods ] ) , we present computational results ( section [ sec : results ] ) on knot abundance for a variety of models differing in the width of their steplength distribution .",
    "in addition to the already mentioned loops with fixed , and gaussian - distributed steplengths , in order to look at the even broader distributions which allow for very long segments , we also generated loops with the generalized cauchy - lorentz `` random - flight '' distribution .",
    "finally , we include loops of bimodally distributed fixed steplength .    in brief ,",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "first , we confirm the exponential decay law of the unknot probability , formula ( [ eq : triv_p ] ) , across all models examined .",
    "second , we find qualitatively that indeed a wider distribution of the segment lengths leads to knot suppression , ie a larger @xmath2 .",
    "third , and most unexpectedly , we find that @xmath2 does not show any signs of any singular behavior associated with the divergence of mean squared segment length or any other moment of the segment length distribution .",
    "instead , @xmath2 blows up and appears to grow without a bound when the distribution of segment lengths approaches the border of normalizability .",
    "all polymer models referenced and employed in this work use a freely jointed model to represent a polymer loop .",
    "the polymer is represented by a set of @xmath0 vertices in 3d , with position vectors @xmath18 , where the step between successive vertices is described , @xmath19 . in all models ,",
    "we assume that the distribution of segment vectors @xmath20 , which we call @xmath21 , is spherically symmetric and depends only on the steplength @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 we also assume that the mean squared steplength is always the same ( when defined ! - see below ) , we denote it @xmath24 : @xmath25 with this in mind , the simplest measure of the distribution breadth involves higher order moments : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "specifically , we analyzed the following models .",
    "the * fixed steplength model * is described by the distribution @xmath28 for this model , of course @xmath29 . with @xmath0 segments ,",
    "the loop s contour length is obviously @xmath30 and the mean squared gyration radius of the loop is @xmath31 .",
    "the * gaussian steplength model * is generated by the distribution @xmath32 \\ , \\ ] ] in this case , @xmath33 .",
    "the contour length of the @xmath0-segment loop in this model is @xmath34 and the mean squared gyration radius is @xmath35 .",
    "the * random flight steplength model * is obtained from the generalized cauchy - lorenz distribution ( also known in the theory of lvy flights @xcite ) of the form @xmath36",
    "\\right/ \\left ( 4 \\ell^3 \\pi^2 \\right ) } { 1+(r/\\ell)^{\\alpha } } \\ , \\label{eq : mcl_prob}\\ ] ] where the factor in the numerator ensures normalization . here",
    ", @xmath37 , a parameter of the distribution , must be greater than @xmath38 , otherwise the normalization integral diverges .",
    "nevertheless , it would be fair to speak about a family of random - flight models , parameterized by @xmath39 , instead of just one model .",
    "varying @xmath37 allows us to work with a `` tunable '' distribution .",
    "these distributions `` fat '' power - law tails lead to diverging moments ( which is why they are used to describe super - diffusive behavior seen in biological foraging @xcite , and quite recently , in the diffusion of bank - notes across the united states , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the ensemble - averaged contour length of the loop is well defined only at @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , mean squared gyration radius exists at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 only exists at @xmath44 , in which case it is equal to @xmath45 ^ 2 } { \\sin\\left [ 3 \\pi / \\alpha \\right ] \\sin\\left [ 7\\pi / \\alpha \\right]}-1 } \\ \\ \\ ( { \\rm at } \\",
    "\\alpha > 7 ) \\",
    ".\\ ] ] finally , we also include loops with * bimodally distributed steplength*. for these loops , @xmath46 which means that two possible steplengths , @xmath47 or @xmath48 , occur with probabilities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , subject to the normalization conditions , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "all bimodally distributed models can be conveniently parameterized by @xmath49 and @xmath53 . for these models",
    ", @xmath54 might be very large if @xmath55 is very large and @xmath49 is rather close to unity ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "unbiased generation of closed loops is of decisive importance for our work .",
    "recently , we gave a detailed review of the existing computational methods to generate statistically representative closed loops ( see the last section of the work @xcite ) . in principle , the best way to generate loops is based on the so - called conditional probability method .",
    "the idea is that a closed path is generated as a random walk , step by step , except after the completion of @xmath57 steps , the next step , @xmath58 , is generated from the analytically computed probability distribution of the step vector @xmath20 , subject to the condition that after @xmath59 more steps , the walker returns to the starting point .",
    "this idea was first suggested and implemented for gaussian distributed steps @xcite .",
    "recently , we implemented this method for steps of equal length @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this method is computationally costly , and appears to be prohibitively difficult to implement for more sophisticated models , such as random flight .",
    "we therefore use the simpler method , called the method of triangles . this method",
    "@xcite generates loops of @xmath0 segments with @xmath0 divisible by @xmath60 .",
    "it involves creating a set of @xmath61 equilateral triangles , each randomly oriented in 3d space .",
    "each triangle is considered a triplet of vectors with zero sum .",
    "a random permutation of the @xmath0 edge vectors which make up these @xmath61 triangles , and then connecting all @xmath0 vectors head - to - tail , creates a loop which will be closed , as the @xmath0 bond vectors together have @xmath62 vector sum .",
    "of course , this method imposes correlations between segments .",
    "we therefore take special care to compare the results of this method with the unbiased generation using the conditional probability method for both gaussian distributed and equal length step models .",
    "we found that no appreciable deviations in knot abundance data arise from the imperfection of the triangle method .",
    "we therefore use the method of triangles to generate the random flight and bimodal distributed loops , for which no alternative method is available . to avoid even the slightest problems with correlations , implicit in our triplet method , and to ensure that the decay of trivial knot probability is in the exponential regime",
    ", we exclude the data from small loops and fit the trivial knot probability on the interval @xmath63 $ ] .      for each of the models listed above , we generated loops of up to at least @xmath64 segments .",
    "once the loop was generated , its knotted state was assessed computationally with the alexander determinant , @xmath65 , as well as the vassilev invariants of degree @xmath66 and @xmath60 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for this purpose , we employed knot analyzing routines described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the fraction of generated loops with trivial topology was recorded for each loop type . in the interval @xmath69 ,",
    "every sample consisted of at least @xmath70 loops . as a result ,",
    "the plot of trivial knot probability was created for each model , with statistical error bars smaller than the data points in figure [ fig : compare_fixed_and_gaussian ] .",
    "based on the data , @xmath2 was measured for every model in our repertoire .",
    "our main results are shown in figure [ fig : compare_fixed_and_gaussian ] . there , we present the semi - log plots of the data on the trivial knot probability as a function of the number of segments @xmath0 for a variety of models . to begin with , all our data agree quite well with the exponential character of the @xmath71 dependence , formula ( [ eq : triv_p ] ) .",
    "our main emphasis is therefore the study of the characteristic value of @xmath2 for various models .",
    "let us start with the two most commonly used models .",
    "in the case of fixed length steps , we obtain @xmath72 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , for gaussian distributed length steps we get @xmath73 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all data for the gaussian model was generated using the fundamentally unbiased conditional probability method .",
    "for the model with fixed length steps , we compare in figure [ fig : checking_triangles ] the data obtained by the conditional probability method @xcite and data generated by the much more efficient method of triangles ( see above section [ sec : generation ] ) .",
    "as the figure indicates , there is practically no visible difference in the results .",
    "accordingly , we unreservedly rely on the triangles method in the rest of this work .",
    "although our main attention in this paper is on the trivial knots ( unknots ) , we show in figure [ fig : other_knots ] some data for more complex knot probabilities . our data at least do not contradict the assertion that the probability of every particular knot decays exponentially at sufficiently large @xmath0 , with the same decay length as the trivial knot probability . at the same time",
    ", our data also confirm the systematic difference between models - decay length , although the same for all types of knots , does depend on the distribution of step lengths involved .",
    "specifically , probabilities of knots @xmath74 and @xmath75 decay at a noticeably slower rate for the gaussian model than for the model with fixed steps",
    ".      the results of our study of loops with random - flight steplength , @xmath76 $ ] , are summarized in figures [ fig : compare_fixed_and_gaussian ] and [ fig : mcl_fit ] .",
    "the raw curves of probability given in figure [ fig : compare_fixed_and_gaussian ] clearly show that the odds of finding an unknot in a set of loops get increasingly unfavorable as @xmath37 decreases .",
    "that is not unexpected : at smaller @xmath37 , the probability distribution ( [ eq : mcl_prob ] ) acquires an increasingly fat tail , which implies the presence of a fraction of exceptionally long segments , and they of course suppress the chance of knots .    at very large @xmath37",
    ", the knot probability for the random flight model appears similar to the data for fixed steplength loops .",
    "indeed , as figure [ fig : mcl_fit ] indicates , @xmath2 for the random flight model at very large @xmath37 approaches @xmath77 which is not dramatically different from @xmath72 for the fixed length steps .",
    "in fact , the remaining difference might be associated with the fact that even at very large @xmath37 , the random flight model , although it has essentially no very long steps , has some relatively short ones , which might account for the discrepancy in @xmath2 .",
    "figures [ fig : compare_fixed_and_gaussian ] and [ fig : mcl_fit ] show further that at @xmath78 , the random - flight loops behave essentially the same way as gaussian steps in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "most interestingly , figure [ fig : mcl_fit ] shows no sign of anything unusual happening to @xmath2 at the values of @xmath37 at which various physically important moments of the segment length distribution ( [ eq : mcl_prob ] ) start diverging . for instance , at @xmath79 the mean squared gyration radius diverges , at @xmath80 even the contour length of the loop diverges - and yet none of these facts find any visible reflection on the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath2 keeps smoothly increasing with @xmath37 , with a maximum measured value of @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "it appears that @xmath2 in fact blows up and goes to infinity as @xmath83 approaches @xmath60 - the border below which the distribution ( [ eq : mcl_prob ] ) is not normalizeable .",
    "moreover , as the inset of figure [ fig : mcl_fit ] shows , this divergence is well approximated by the power law dependence of the form , @xmath84 in fitting the data with this power law , we ignored the small irregularities visible around @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 \\approx 2.2 $ ] ) , which we attribute to the numerical problems with the cutoff implemented in our use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_prob ] ) .",
    "the meaning and physical origin of the apparent criticality observed at @xmath37 approaching its minimal possible value of @xmath60 currently evades our understanding .      for this model",
    ", we examined the interval @xmath87 $ ] , with at least @xmath70 loops in each simulation record for @xmath88 , and at least @xmath89 loops in those records used with length @xmath90 .",
    "we also consider parameters @xmath49 and @xmath91 in the intervals @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] , respectively . by symmetry , it is sufficient to look at @xmath94 ; this means , @xmath49 is the fraction of _ shorter _ segments .",
    "the raw data from the loops with bimodal steplength are presented in figure [ fig : bimodal_surface ] .",
    "this surface plot charts the change in @xmath2 as a function of two parameters of the model , @xmath49 and @xmath55 . below the surface",
    "is the corresponding contour plot of @xmath2 as a function of these two parameters .",
    "the changes in @xmath2 are smooth , and there do not seem to be any singularities in the behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "the maximum observed value of @xmath95 occurs at @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "this maximum of @xmath2 appears to be rather sharp , small deviations in @xmath49 from @xmath98 lead to smaller @xmath2 values . from the data ,",
    "we believe that in this model @xmath2 is maximized when the fraction of shorter segments is @xmath99 . as regards the second degree of freedom , @xmath55 , while our data certainly shows that as @xmath100 the bimodal system approaches the fixed steplength system of section [ fixed_step_loops ] ( ie @xmath101 ) , in the opposite direction of @xmath102 , it is not clear if @xmath2 will continue to increase in an unbounded way or be in some way encumbered . in this",
    "regard our present knot analysis machinery is limited by the relative disparity between segments of different length , and more work needs to be done to elucidate the scaling of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "qualitatively , all of our data are consistent with the idea that what suppresses knots is the presence of a fraction of unusually long segments .",
    "one could then hypothesize that @xmath2 might depend on some unique property of the segment length distribution , for instance , @xmath43 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigm_def ] ) .",
    "this hypothesis is tested in figure [ fig : bimodal_compare_small ] ; the figure indicates that the hypothesis fails",
    ". nevertheless , the results presented in this figure are interesting , as they show that large @xmath2 can be achieved by the combination of segment length difference ( @xmath55 ) and segment type fractions .",
    "although a functional relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath37 seems evident in our data for random flight loops , the data we have for loops with bimodal distribution of steplength do not suggest a simple single parameter which determines @xmath2 .",
    "in a qualitative sense , it does seem that there exists a relationship between @xmath2 and the reach of successive segments within the chain ( as seen in figure [ fig : bimodal_compare_small ] ) .",
    "it seems qualitatively clear indeed that knottedness is greatly suppressed by the presence of some very long segments .",
    "thus , the slowly decaying tail of the segment length probability distribution , or the presence of a small fraction of very long segments , implies a large @xmath2 , which sounds natural .",
    "however , our understanding of these observations beyond the qualitative level is limited .",
    "we found that @xmath2 appears to exhibit no singularity associated with divergence of any natural characteristics of the loop , such as its gyration radius or even contour length ; instead , @xmath2 exhibits power law critical behavior when the segment length distribution approaches the boundary of normalizability .",
    "in addition , we do not know which property of the segment length distribution determines @xmath2 .",
    "we have established that this is not simply the distribution width , and from the results with random flight distribution it seems also clear that it is not based on any finite moments of the distribution .",
    "we consider the development of a fuller understanding of the variance of @xmath2 a compelling challenge .",
    "the data clearly show that wide variation in the behavior of @xmath2 is possible , including very large values of @xmath2 in certain models .",
    "given that @xmath2 plays the role of the cross - over length for the critical behavior of topologically constrained loops @xcite , we can speculate that the models with very large @xmath2 are in some way similar to the models of self - avoidance in the vicinity of the @xmath104-point .",
    "we think that this analogy deserves very close attention .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussion with a.l .",
    "efros and a.  vologodskii .",
    "we express thanks to r. lua for the use of his knot analysis routines .",
    "we are grateful for access to the minnesota supercomputing institute s ibm core resources and the university of minnesota physics department linux cluster , resources which made much of the simulation possible .",
    "this work was supported in part by the mrsec program of the national science foundation under award number dmr-0212302 .",
    "to generate steplengths from the random - flight distribution ( [ eq : mcl_prob ] ) , we first take a random number @xmath105 from the uniform distribution on the interval @xmath106 $ ] and then find steplength @xmath107 as @xmath108 , where the mapping @xmath109 is determined by the equation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcl_prob ] ) . although a closed - form representation of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_prob ] ) exists in the form of an incomplete beta function , @xcite , we chose to implement the mapping via a numerical interpolation of tabulated values of the integral .",
    "as the power - law tail of this distribution is quite fat , particularly at small @xmath37 , accurate representation of the integral becomes challenging at large steplengths .",
    "this work is ultimately numerical , and we are forced to truncate the representation of the integral to @xmath112 at some maximum steplength , ie specifying an upper bound on @xmath109 .",
    "the slow convergence of the tail is behind the appearance of the few outliers in the data for the random - flight method , figure [ fig : mcl_fit ] .",

    "<S> a veritable zoo of different knots is seen in the ensemble of looped polymer chains , whether created computationally or observed in vitro . at short loop lengths , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of knots is dominated by the trivial knot ( unknot ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional abundance of this topological state in the ensemble of all conformations of the loop of @xmath0 segments follows a decaying exponential form , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 marks the crossover from a mostly unknotted ( ie topologically simple ) to a mostly knotted ( ie topologically complex ) ensemble . in the present work we use computational simulation to look closer into the variation of @xmath2 for a variety of polymer models . among models examined , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is smallest ( about @xmath3 ) for the model with all segments of the same length , it is somewhat larger ( @xmath4 ) for gaussian distributed segments , and can be very large ( up to many thousands ) when the segment length distribution has a fat power law tail . </S>"
