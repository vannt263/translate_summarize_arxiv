    "the study of hot gas at temperature of 10@xmath5 k or greater has been the province of x - ray astronomy since the resonance transitions of the most common ionic states occur in the 0.1 - 8 kev range .",
    "hot gas is found to be very common in a wide range of astronomical objects , such as galaxy clusters , early - type galaxies , and starburst galaxies , where it is seen in emission .",
    "in addition , most of the baryons in the local universe are predicted to have temperatures of 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 k , filling the volumes of modest overdensity cosmological filaments , sometimes referred to as the `` cosmic web '' ( this is also the warm - hot intergalactic medium , or whim ) .",
    "this gas is too dilute to be a significant emitter , but it is possible for it to produce absorption , which has been searched for at x - ray wavelengths , but not convincingly detected @xcite .",
    "the radio band provides another approach to detecting hot gas through the hyperfine transitions of ions with magnetic moments , a possibility first discussed by @xcite in the context of supernova remnants and galaxy clusters .",
    "an advantage to using this approach is that the velocity resolution is far superior relative to current x - ray techniques , permitting one to easily resolve the hyperfine line and obtain a precise line center .",
    "the primary disadvantage is that most of the lines are weak and sometimes at frequencies where it is difficult to make observations .",
    "this transition is a hyperfine spin - flip transition , the same that is responsible for the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "it requires that the magnetic moment of an electron interact with the magnetic moment of the nucleus .",
    "the magnetic moment is greatest for the electron if there is a single valence electron , so hydrogenic or lithium - like ions are preferred , along with nuclei that have an odd number of protons ( or an odd mass number ) so that not all the magnetic moments are cancelled .",
    "the first criteria is easily met , but the second one is more problematic because nature prefers to build atoms with alpha particles , so nearly all of the abundant elements have an even number nuclear charge or an even atomic mass .",
    "the two most common elements with odd nuclear charge are hydrogen and nitrogen , the latter being abundant only due to the presence of the cno cycle in stars .",
    "therefore , it is hydrogenic - like nitrogen ( ) that has the most favorable hyperfine transition , after the hi 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the line from @xmath12n occurs at 53.042 ghz @xcite , a frequency regime where there is very significant attenuation due to oxygen resonance lines in the earth s atmosphere , making low redshift observations impossible .    because of this opacity problem , as well as the lack of receivers ,",
    "most of the attention of observers was focused on the li - like fe isotope line , @xmath13fe xxiv , which is present in gas near 10@xmath11 k and has a transition at 98 ghz @xcite , a clear mm window for which there are good receivers .",
    "this line was searched for in emission , but not detected ( liang et al .",
    "1997 ) , the limits not being very restrictive in regard to model predictions @xcite .    here",
    "we reconsider the emission and absorption possibilities for @xmath12n , which is two orders of magnitude more common than @xmath13fe .",
    "our motivation is that the _ green bank telescope _ ( gbt ) has an excellent receiver in the atmospherically transparent 42 - 48 ghz range , with a spectrometer that can sample this entire range ( @xmath14 z = 0.16 ) in only four separate settings and with a velocity resolution of 2.7 km s@xmath15 , which could easily resolve emission or absorption from this ion at its doppler width ( fwhm = 80 km s@xmath15 at 10@xmath5 k ) . to use this receiver ,",
    "we are forced to work in the redshift range 0.11 - 0.26 .",
    "this @xmath12n hyperfine line has atomic properties that make it competitive with the hi hyperfine line for both emission and absorption .",
    "it has a critical density of 0.15 @xmath16 , and above this value , the emissivity is @xmath17 @xmath18 n@xmath19a@xmath20 , where n@xmath19 is the density of an element in a particular ionization state and a@xmath20 is the einstein - a value . for hydrogen",
    ", a@xmath20= 2.87@xmath710@xmath21 sec@xmath22 , while for the line , a@xmath20 = 1.99@xmath710@xmath23 sec@xmath22 @xcite , so even though the nitrogen abundance is 9.1@xmath710@xmath24 relative to hydrogen ( at solar abundance ) , the difference in the a values compensates so that the volume emissivity is the same for line and the 21 cm line when nitrogen is 1/6 of its solar abundance ( comparing equal masses of 10@xmath5 k gas and hi gas ) . the emission line will be detectable in this redshift range if 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath25 m@xmath4 of million degree gas is present , which might occur in a cluster of galaxies or an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) . the emission line component of our gbt program was to search for such emission from a few different objects .    in absorption ,",
    "the density of the whim is predicted to be 10@xmath26- 10@xmath27 @xmath28 @xcite , well below the critical density , so all atoms are in their ground state .",
    "thus , unlike the hi 21 cm transition , there is no stimulated emission to reduce the optical depth .",
    "the line becomes detectable in absorption for a column density of 10@xmath29 -10@xmath30 @xmath31 of million degree gas ( 1/10 solar metallicities ) , which would occur in a filament 1 mpc in length and of total particle density 10@xmath32 @xmath28 .",
    "such column densities can occur , according to simulations @xcite , so we have searched for absorption features against strong continuum sources in the 42 - 48 ghz range .",
    "the observations were taken using the 100 m nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) during the two nights of 2006 february 19 and february 21 in the 4248 ghz frequency range using the q - band receiver .",
    "the q - band receiver is divided into two frequency ranges with separate feed and amplifier sets .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was configured in its four - intermediate frequncy ( if ) 800 mhz width three - level mode , which allows observing two 800 mhz frequency bands in two polarizations at once .",
    "double beam switching was employed such that the source appeared in each of the dual beams alternately for a period of 1 minute .",
    "the data were analyzed using gbtidl @xcite v1.2.1 .",
    "bad scans were removed , and the remaining scans were accumulated and averaged .",
    "the total useful observing time for each object / band number is listed in table 1 .",
    "most of the observing time was used to search for absorption lines against strong continuum sources , but the baselines can not be fit with simple functions , which introduces challenges . presumably , the structure in the baseline is due to standing waves in the feedhorn and receiver , but this is not well - documented yet . to flatten the baseline structure , we tried a variety of procedures , the most successful being a two - step procedure . in the first step ,",
    "we smooth the spectrum , using adjacent averaging over 200 channels , or about 520 km s@xmath15 at 45 ghz ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the original spectrum , in which t@xmath33 varies by about 10% of a 0.8 ghz band , is divided by the smoothed spectrum , and this reduces the variation by more than an order of magnitude , to less than 1% ( figure 2 ) . however , most of these variations are systematic in nature and are nearly identical for two different continuum sources observed over similar frequency ranges .",
    "these systematics were largely removed by subtracting the fluctuations about unity in one spectrum from the other spectrum , leading to a final rms per bin ( an average of 10 channels , or 26 km s@xmath34 that was often less than 0.1% of the normalized flux density ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we tested this procedure by adding spectral lines to a source ( 3c345 ) to see if they were correctly recovered .",
    "the tests worked well and we successfully recovered absorption lines with central optical depths of 0.002 and widths of 90 km s@xmath15 and 220 km s@xmath15 ( fwhm ) , which are about the line widths anticipated ( figure 3 ) .",
    "lines as wide as the averaging length will not be recovered reliably , but we should easily be able to detect lines of width 300 km s@xmath15 or less .",
    "one aspect of this procedure is that for the final step , one would ideally want to have a strong featureless source , but in general , such a source was either not available or not used .",
    "instead , for a calibration source , we used either 3c 279 or 3c 273 , or when both were observed in the same band , the average of the two . when using these sources for the final calibration , a problem that can arise if one of the sources has an intrinsic absorption line .",
    "this will appear as an emission line in the final spectrum , but this emission line will be present in all final spectra , and as there are either three or four strong continuum sources observed in every band , one can inspect the spectra for this effect , and we have done so . this two - step data processing method",
    "was used for 3c273 , 3c279 , 4c39.25 , 3c345 , and pks 1345 + 12 , which has a significantly weaker continuum than the others .    for sources with a weaker continuum or without a detectable continuum , we found that subtracting the smoothed continuum from the unsmoothed data worked well .",
    "this approach was applied to abell 1835 , abell 2390 , and pks 0405 - 12 ( at continuum levels of 0.3 k ) , although for this source , using the ratio method led to similar results . for abell 1835",
    ", there was a noticeable slow baseline structure after subtracting the smoothed continuum , so we also fit and removed a third order polynomial fit to the baseline .",
    "when observing abell 2390 , pks 0405 - 12 , and pks 1345 + 12 , we used overlapping spectral bands to check that if interesting features were observed , that the same structures were detected in both observations .",
    "most of the observations involved searching for absorption features against the radio continua , but for two clusters of galaxies and one star - forming galaxy , we searched for emission .    pks0405 - 12 : although the continuum is much lower than most other targets , this was chosen because it has a known civ and ly@xmath6 absorption system at z = 0.167 @xcite , which would place a absorption line at 45.45 ghz . two sets of observations",
    "were obtained with the central frequency shifted by 0.1 ghz and the central frequency was different than that of the various strong continuum objects . possibly for this reason , we were unable to use the second step of our continuum flattening procedure , so the resulting rms is relatively higher than for the strong continuum sources ( figure 4 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for any absorption at the frequency of the transition .",
    "the upper limit is not in conflict with the detection of the uv absorption lines , which are sensitive to much lower column densities .",
    "pks1345 + 12 : this strong iras source is similar to arp 220 in that it has a double nucleus and a great deal of star formation @xcite . it is also mentioned as a seyfert 2 galaxy and an ir quasar .",
    "we hoped to search for emission due to the hot gas from star formation , or for absorption by hot gas against the radio continuum .",
    "two adjacent bands were observed , which included the redshift of the object , but neither emission nor absorption were detected ( figure 5 ) . an object with a continuum",
    "makes it more challenging to detect emission , so the rms is larger than for objects without a significant continuum .",
    "abell 1835 : this cluster of galaxies has strongly centrally concentrated x - ray emission with a cooling time much less than a hubble time , so it was a classic cooling flow cluster until _ xmm _ observations failed to find the expected strong ovii emission @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "observations place a limit on the cooling rate of @xmath250 m@xmath4 yr@xmath35 .",
    "there is no significant radio continuum and there is no detectable emission from the ion ( figure 6 ) .",
    "abell 2390 : this is another cluster with strong x - ray emission , similar to abell 1835 , but not as luminous and with a lower cooling rate as inferred from pre-_xmm _ data @xcite ; h@xmath36 was detected by @xcite .",
    "two observations were obtained where the central frequency was shifted by 0.3 ghz , but both scans included the redshift region of abell 2390 .",
    "the common regions were combined and the rms was quite low in the resulting spectrum .",
    "no features ar detected at or above the 5@xmath1 level , which we require for a confident detection .",
    "the strongest emission feature is at the 3.7@xmath1 level and near the redshift of the galaxy cluster ( line flux of 0.51@xmath370.14 k km s@xmath15 , fwhm = 66@xmath3720 km s@xmath15 ; figure 7 ) .",
    "statistically , a positive feature of this significance occurs 0.01% of the time .",
    "the feature is present in both of the individual scans and at about the same strength ( figure 8) .",
    "a feature of this strength would have been below the detection threshold in abell 1835 or pks 1345 + 12 due to the higher rms in the spectra .",
    "we hope to obtain addition observations to determine the reality of this feature .",
    "the strong continuum sources : the two strong continuum sources 3c 279 and 3c 273 provide the highest s / n continua against which to search for absorption lines . there are no known strong absorption lines in either source over the available redshift range 0.11 @xmath38 z @xmath38 0.26 , although the emission line redshift for 3c 273 lies in the observing range , at 45.8 ghz .",
    "we did not observe 3c273 at frequencies below 45 ghz , so for the 42 - 45 ghz region , we differenced 3c 279 with 3c 345 and 4c + 39.25 to search for absorption features .",
    "since we are differencing spectra , should one have an absorption line , we would see that as an emission line . in the differences of 3c 279 and 3c 273 over the 45 - 48 ghz band",
    ", there were no statistically significant absorption or emission features , with impressively low rms values ( 5@xmath1 upper limits of 0.085 - 0.25 km s@xmath15 for 100 km",
    "s@xmath15 wide lines ; table 1 and figure 9 - 12 ) .",
    "since no features were seen in this spectral region , we averaged the two spectra and used that average to remove the small variations in the spectra of 3c345 and 4c+39.45 in the 45 - 48 ghz range .",
    "in the frequency range 45 - 48 ghz , there are no significant absorption feature in 3c 345 or 4c+39.25 above the 5@xmath39 level , so we do not claim detections due to absorption in any or our targets .",
    "the strongest feature is found in absorption in the spectrum of 4c+39.25 , and it occurs in the middle of the 45.0 - 45.8 ghz band , which has the best response and lowest rms of any band .",
    "when we fit for the continuum level , central frequency ( 45.38@xmath370.04 ghz ) , line width ( fwhm = 99@xmath3723 km s@xmath15 ) , and equivalent width ( 0.19@xmath370.05 km s@xmath15 ) , the feature has a significance of a 3.8@xmath1 .",
    "had we fixed some fitting parameters , such as the continuum level , or not fit for certain parameters , such as the line width , the significance would be greater ( 4.9@xmath1 ) .",
    "an absorption feature of this strength ( 3.8@xmath1 ) would occur by chance once in about 10@xmath40 trials , provided that the noise has a normal distribution .",
    "there are about 30 - 40 independent regions in a single 0.8 ghz band , so for all the bands of all the objects , there were about 10@xmath41 independent regions in which an absorption feature could have occurred .",
    "this feature is rarer than would be expected by chance , but to be cautious , we intepret it as a non - detection until confirmed .    in the frequency range 42 - 45 ghz , there are no significant features in any object ( figures 13 - 16 ) .",
    "there are a few features in the 2.5 - 3@xmath1 range , but that is to be expected for the amount of data obtained .",
    "although we do not detect any emission or absorption features above the 5@xmath1 level , we can discuss whether the two strongest features are likely to be confirmed . for this exercise ,",
    "we compare these features to theoretical predictions .    we can convert the putative line flux seen in abell 2390 into a luminosity , and a mass , in the high and low density limits .",
    "the total observed flux would be 7.3@xmath710@xmath42 erg @xmath31 s@xmath15 , or a luminosity of 9.2@xmath710@xmath43 erg s@xmath15 ( about four orders of magnitude less than the luminosity of the optical and h@xmath44 lines ) . in the limit where the density is greater than the critical density ( 0.15 @xmath28 ) , the required gas mass is 1.2@xmath710@xmath3 [ n / h ] m@xmath4 and the size would need to be smaller than 11 kpc to achieve this density .",
    "this size is encompassed within the beam , which projects to a radius of 36 kpc .",
    "the largest mass occurs when the emitting region uniformly fills the beam , and this leads to a density below the critical density and a mass of 6@xmath710@xmath3 [ n / h]@xmath45 ( t/2@xmath710@xmath5 k)@xmath46 m@xmath4 .",
    "the mass is confined to a relatively narrow range that is orders of magnitude less than the total gas mass in the system . however , the cooling time for this gas is about 2 @xmath710@xmath5 yr for a gas density of 0.1 @xmath16 , which would lead to an enormous cooling rate in excess of 10@xmath41 m@xmath4 yr@xmath22 .",
    "for hot x - ray emitting gas to reach the temperature at which occurs , it would have to pass through the temperature range in which is found ( 10@xmath47 k ) , yet the x - ray upper limits on the emission line strength restrict the cooling rate to @xmath38 50 m@xmath4 yr@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "it might be possible to find a model in which the is supressed while the is visible , but until such a model is found , the current theoretical expectations would suggest that this emission feature in abell 2390 is unlikely to be real .",
    "the other feature of note is the absorption feature in 4c+39.25 , which can be converted into a column density for comparison with expectations . in the optically thin limit",
    ", we can use the usual linear relationship between the fractional equivalent width and the column density to obtain n ( ) = 1.6@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath31 .",
    "however , this value does not take into account the excitation rate corrections due to the interaction with the cosmic microwave background , as discussed by @xcite . at z = 0.17 , this reduces the cross section by a factor of 0.29 . including this , the implied total column density is , for an ionization fraction of 0.5 , n = 1.3@xmath710@xmath30 ( z / z@xmath4)@xmath15 @xmath9 . if this were to represent a modest overdensity filament , and the filament is typically 2 mpc in diameter ( @xcite ; or greater , if we are looking along a filament ) , the gas density would be 2@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath16 .",
    "while this seems feasible , it is larger than the columns that @xcite predict .",
    "we have used the tempertures , densities , and metallicities from their simulations to determine the highest column densities in their simulations , covering a redshift range of @xmath14z = 0.3 , which is comparable to the total path length sampled by all strong continuum sources ( @xmath14z = 0.43 ) .",
    "their simulation implies a maximum column of n ( ) = 1@xmath710@xmath48 @xmath9 , about 50 times lower than the column associated with this feature . their metallicity is 0.08 z@xmath4 at the location of this absorption feature , and it is hard to imagine that it could be more than a factor of a few higher , which would not make their predicted column detectable .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by @xcite , who also considered the recent models of @xcite . since the model prediction is more than an order of magnitude lower than the column density associated with this feature , it is unlikely to be a real absorption feature .    in the 40 - 50 gh range ,",
    "the sources chosen for absorption studies are the brightest sources available , but for emission line studies , the best targets are at a redshift too low to be accessible with the current receiver . for example , the two best galaxy clusters would be abell 2597 and abell 426 ( the perseus cluster ) , as both show strong evidence for cooling gas , at rates of 30 - 50 m@xmath49 yr@xmath35 @xcite",
    ". however , their redshifts place the nvii line at 49.0 ghz and 52.2 ghz . observations at 52.2 ghz may never be feasible due to atmospheric extinction , but observations at 49.0 ghz may be possible with modifications to the gbt receiver . similarly , there are nearer galaxies with very active star formation ( i.e. , 10035 + 4852 , 10565 + 2488 ) and nearer x - ray bright elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , ngc 6414 and kig 412 ) , but this would demand that observations be made in the 50 - 51 ghz range , which is currently not possible . at these frequencies ,",
    "the opacity decreases with altitude , so observing at the alma site has several advantages , although in the current plan , a 50 ghz receiver will not be available .    for purposes of detecting absorption by dilute gas in the million degree range , it is valuable to compare the columns detectable using the hyperfine line and the x - ray lines of and . at x - ray energies , absorption is the best line to detect and toward the brightest sources it has been detected ( at z = 0 ) for n ( ) of 10@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "these exposures typically require 300 ksec to reach this detection threshold .",
    "our observations are sensitive to a column density about six times larger , but since nitrogen is six times less common than oxygen , the equivalent total gas column needs to be correspondingly greater ( about a factor of 30 ) .",
    "however , our limits were obtained in less than an hour of integration time , two orders of magnitude shorter than the x - ray observations . for the radio observations ,",
    "if the rms decreases with the square root of the integration time , a 30 hour observation would yield a sensitivity for that is within a factor of 5 of the sensitivity of measurements in the x - rays .",
    "one future goal is to determine whether the rms of a radio continuum continues to decrease with longer integration times .",
    "the current observations have an rms that is near the theoretical value , but to achieve it , we used a two - step procedure to flatten the continuum and remove the standing wave structure .",
    "it would be immensely helpful if the amplitude of the standing waves could be reduced at the feedhorn and receiver region .",
    "the most immediate goal is to either confirm or refute the two strongest features , and this can be accomplished by longer integrations and by using a variety of different settings when observing the same object ( e.g. , different central frequency , changing the focus by fractional wave amounts ) .",
    "we would like to thank the gbt staff for their considerable help , and in particular to frank ghigo , ron madellena , and jay lockman .",

    "<S> gas in the million degree range occurs in a variety of astronomical environments , and it may be the main component of the elusive missing baryons at low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the ion is found in this material and it has a hyperfine spin - flip transition with a rest frequency of 53.042 ghz , which can be observed for z @xmath0 0.1 , when it is shifted into a suitably transparent radio band . </S>",
    "<S> we used the 42 - 48 ghz spectrometer on the _ green bank telescope _ to search for both emission and absorption from this transmission . for absorption studies , 3c273 , 3c 279 , </S>",
    "<S> 3c 345 , and 4c+39.25 were observed but no feature were seen above the 5@xmath1 level . for emission line studies , we observed abell 1835 , abell 2390 and the star - forming galaxy pks 1345 + 12 , but no features were seen exceeding 5@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we examine whether the strongest emission feature , in abell 2390 ( 3.7@xmath1 ) , and the strongest absorption feature , toward 4c+39.25 ( 3.8@xmath1 ) , might be expected from theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> the emission feature would require @xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 of 10@xmath5 k gas , which is inconsistent with x - ray limits for the k@xmath6 line , so it is unlikely to be real . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption feature requires a column of 6@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 , higher than model predictions by at least an order of magnitude , which makes it inconsistent with model expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the individual observations were less than 1 hr in length , so for lengthy observations , we show that absorption line observations can begin to be useful in in the search for hot intergalactic gas . </S>"
