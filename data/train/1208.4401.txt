    "brownian transport in narrow corrugated channels is a topic of potential applications to both natural  @xcite and artificial devices  @xcite .",
    "depending on the amplitude and geometry of the wall modulation , corrugated channels fall within two distinct categories [ fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ] : ( i ) smoothly - corrugated channels ( e.g. , as shown in fig .",
    "also called entropic channels  @xcite , these quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels were first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and further investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , as an instance of two ( 2d ) or three dimensional ( 3d ) systems describable in terms of an effective 1d kinetic equation .",
    "these are typically modeled as periodic channels with axial symmetry and unit cells delimited by bottlenecks which are assumed to be narrow with respect to the cell dimensions , i.e. , the channel cross section and the period ; ( ii ) compartmentalized ( or septate ) channels  @xcite .",
    "these septate channels are sharply corrugated channels formed by identical compartments separated by thin dividing walls and connected by narrow openings ( pores ) centered around their axis . at variance with the case of smoothly corrugated channels , diffusion in compartmentalized channels",
    "can not be reduced to an effective 1d kinetic process directed along the axis .",
    "accordingly , driven transport in such strongly constrained geometries exhibits distinct features , which can not be reconciled with the known properties of brownian motion in quasi-1d systems @xcite .    -axis . in both cases",
    "the channel unit cell is @xmath0 long and @xmath1 wide ; the radius of the connecting bottlenecks or pores is @xmath2 .",
    "[ f1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    corrugated channels are often used to model transport of dilute mixtures of small particles ( like biomolecules , colloids or magnetic vortices ) in confined geometries  @xcite .",
    "each particle is subjected to thermal fluctuations with temperature @xmath3 and large viscous damping constant @xmath4 , and a homogeneous constant force directed locally parallel to the channel axis .",
    "such a dc drive is applied from the outside by coupling the particle to an external field ( for instance , by attaching a dielectric or magnetic dipole , or a magnetic flux to the particle ) , without inducing drag effects on the suspension fluid .",
    "interparticle and hydrodynamic interactions are thus ignored for simplicity ( for a discussion on this assumption see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .             in this paper",
    "we investigate the relevance of the inertia effects due to the viscosity of the suspended particle .",
    "as is often the case with biological and most artificial suspensions  @xcite , the brownian particle dynamics in the bulk can be regarded as overdamped .",
    "this corresponds to ( i ) formally setting the mass of the particle to zero , @xmath5 , or , equivalently , to make the friction strength @xmath4 tend to infinity , and ( ii ) assuming @xmath6 smaller than the thermal force @xmath7 ( smoluchowski approximation )  @xcite .",
    "the current literature on corrugated channels invariably assumes such an overdamped limit . but",
    "how large is an infinite @xmath4 ( or how small a zero @xmath8 ) ?",
    "the answer , of course , depends on the geometry of the channel .",
    "our main conclusion is that the overdamped dynamics assumption for brownian diffusion through pores of width @xmath2 subjected to a homogeneous drive @xmath6 , applies only for the conditions  @xcite : @xmath9 irrespective of the degree of corrugation .",
    "this means that inertial correction can not be neglected as long as the brownian diffusion is spatially correlated on a length ( @xmath10 at small dc drive , or @xmath11 at large dc drive ) of the order of , or larger than , the pore width @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently narrow pores or sufficiently large drives , inertia always comes into play by enhancing the blocking action of the channel bottlenecks .",

    ", the diffusivity grows asymptotically with the drive according to a power law , @xmath165 , where @xmath108 for septate channels and @xmath166 for sinusoidal channels . for smoothly corrugated channels this result may come as a surprise , since , for large damping , the diffusivity is known to approach its bulk value , @xmath167 .",
    "the asymptotic power law with @xmath166 illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] results from the enhanced trapping effect due to the underdamped particle bouncing back and forth against the compartment walls . a simple qualitative argument yields  @xcite @xmath168 in rather good agreement with our simulation data ( see inset of fig .  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "note that , lowering the temperature , for small damping @xmath37 diverges like @xmath169 , which means that diffusion is the result of chaotic ballistic collisions .",
    "inertia corrections to the drive dependence of the diffusivity are not as dramatic in septate channels , fig .",

    "this explains why the role of the threshold @xmath105 , eq .",

    "( [ th - diff ] ) at larger and larger @xmath6 , consistently with the large - drive inertial regime @xmath148 .",
    "finally , we notice that septate and sinusoidally corrugated channels also differ in the large - drive behavior of their mobilities at low damping .",
    "while in septate channels @xmath171 was shown to approach a small but finite value , @xmath172 , see eq .",
    "( [ th - mob ] ) , the mobility in sinusoidal channels was numerically fitted by the scaling law @xmath173 , where @xmath73 is an increasing function of @xmath2 with @xmath174 [ fig .",

    "this means that in sinusoidal channels @xmath175 [ and not @xmath33 ] tends to a finite asymptotic value . by definition , the rescaled mobility can be written as @xmath177 , where @xmath178 denotes the mean drift time of a particle across a compartment in the presence of a strong drive .",
    "accordingly , as @xmath74 , the drift time @xmath178 becomes insensitive to the ( large ) drive , which hints at an emerging ballistic dynamics @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the above scaling law for @xmath179 applies to all pore geometries with @xmath180 @xcite , see fig .",

    "the main result of this work is that for real physical suspensions flowing through confined geometries , both in biological and artificial systems , pore crossings grow increasingly sensitive to the suspension fluid viscosity with decreasing the pore radius . with respect to previous attempts at incorporating finite - mass effects in the analysis of brownian transport through corrugated narrow channels  @xcite",
