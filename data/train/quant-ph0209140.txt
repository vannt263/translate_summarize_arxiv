    "quantum information processing exploits quantum properties of physical objects , basically entanglement , to improve performances of communication channels and computational schemes . perhaps , the most impressive quantum information protocol realized so far is teleportation , where the inherent nonlocality of entangled states is manifestly demonstrated .",
    "teleportation experiments have been mostly performed in the optical domain both for polarization qubit @xcite and coherent states of a continuous variable ( cv ) system ( a single mode radiation field ) @xcite . in optical cv teleportation entanglement",
    "is provided by the so - called twin - beam ( twb ) of radiation @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 being two modes of the field and @xmath3 the twb parameter ( without loss of generality we can take @xmath3 real , @xmath4 ) .",
    "twbs are produced by spontaneous downconversion in nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers .",
    "@xmath5 is a pure state and thus its entanglement can be quantified by the excess von - neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "the entropy of a two - mode state @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 = - \\hbox{tr}\\left\\{\\varrho \\log\\varrho\\right\\}$ ] whereas the entropies of the two modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by @xmath8 = -\\hbox{tr}_j\\left\\{\\varrho_j \\log\\varrho_j\\right\\}$ ] , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoting the partial traces .",
    "the degree of entanglement of the state @xmath6 is given by @xmath12 + s[\\varrho_b ] - s[\\varrho]$ ] , which formalizes the idea that the stronger are the correlations in the two - mode pure state , the more disordered should be the two modes taken separately .",

    "notice that for _ pure _ state @xmath17 represents the unique measure of entanglement @xcite and that twbs are maximally entangled states for a given ( average ) number of photons .",
    "the degree of entanglement is a monotonically increasing function of either @xmath18 or @xmath19 . the larger is the entanglement the higher ( closer to unit ) is the fidelity of teleportation based on twb",
    ".    the twb parameter , which is sometimes also referred to as the squeezing parameter of @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal used as amplifying medium and @xmath24 an effective interaction length . for a given amplifier ,",
    "the twb parameter and thus the amount of entanglement , is in principle fixed .",
    "however , since nonlinearities are small , and the crystal length can not be increase at will , it is of interest to devise suitable quantum operations to increase entanglement and in turn to improve teleportation fidelity . in ref .",
    "@xcite opatrn _",
    "et al _ suggest photon subtraction ( ps ) as a scheme to increase entanglement , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite milburn _",
    "et al _ show that the fidelity of coherent state teleportation with ps is indeed increased for any value of the initial twb parameter and of the coherent amplitude .",
    "ps is based on mixing each channel of a twb with the vacuum in a high transmissivity beam splitter and then counting the number of photons in one of the outgoing arms ( probe mode ) . upon detecting exactly one photon in both probes",
    "one has the photon - subtracted and thus entanglement enhanced , state to be used in a teleporting device .",
    "although recent developments toward effective photocounting are encouraging , the discrimination of one photon from zero , two , three and so on is still experimentally challenging .",
    "therefore , the ps scheme studied in refs .",
    "@xcite appears to be of difficult implementation .",
    "here we focus our attention on the experimental implementation of cv teleportation and , therefore , analyze a different ps scheme where photodetection after the beam splitter is inconclusive _",
    "i.e. _ it is performed by a realistic on / off ( geiger - like ) detector which only discriminates , with quantum efficiency @xmath25 , the vacuum from the presence of any number of photons .",
    "as we will see , inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) is an effective method to increase photon correlations of twb and , in turn , to improve fidelity in coherent state teleportation , provided that the initial twb energy is below a certain value .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : ips ] we describe in details the ips scheme , whereas in section [ s : tel ] we analyze the use of the ips output state in coherent state teleportation . section [ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",

    "the corresponding conditional state for the modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be referred to as the ips state .",
    "notice that this kind of measurement is _ inconclusive _ , _",

    "when the initial state carries reserved information , it is important that the only existing copy will be the bob s one . on the other hand , using the usual teleportation scheme , bob can not avoid the presence of an eavesdropper , which can clone the state , obviously introducing some error @xcite , but he is able to to verify if his state was duplicated .",
    "this is possible by the analysis of the average teleportation fidelity : when fidelity is greater than @xmath90 @xcite , bob is sure that his state was not cloned @xcite .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ f : xvstaueff ] shows the values @xmath91 which give an average fidelity ( [ ave : summed ] ) equal to @xmath90 : notice that when @xmath92 both the teleportation is improved and the the fidelity is greater than @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , while the condition @xmath93 is satisfied only if @xmath94 , for the ips state there exists a @xmath95-dependent interval of @xmath3 values ( @xmath96 ) for which teleportation can be considered _ secure _ ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we have analyzed a photon subtraction scheme similar to that of refs .",
    "@xcite to modify twin - beam and improve coherent state teleportation .",
    "the difference in our analysis is that the conditional photodetection after the beam splitters is considered inconclusive , _",
    "i.e. _ performed by on / off detectors which do not discriminate among the number of photons .",
    "this is closer to the current experimental situations and provides a higher conditional probability .",
    "we found that fidelity is improved compared to that of twb - based teleportation if the initial twb parameter is smaller than a threshold value , which in turn depends on the beam splitter transmissivity and on the quantum efficiency of the photodetectors .",
    "for realistic values of these parameters ( @xmath25 larger than @xmath98 and @xmath26 larger than @xmath99 ) the threshold is close to unit .",
    "in addition , there exists a interval of @xmath3 for which teleportation can be considered _ secure _ , _ i.e _ the receiver is able to check whether or not the state has been duplicated before teleportation .",
