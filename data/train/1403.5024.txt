    "a rational map of one complex variable acts on the riemann sphere and generates a dynamical system by iteration .",
    "one general principle in analyzing the dynamical system is to decompose it into invariant sub - systems with simpler dynamics .",
    "the riemann sphere is canonically decomposed into the disjoint union of the fatou set and the julia set , defined by whether the iterated sequence forms a normal family in a neighborhood of the point . while the dynamics on the fatou set is relatively tame , the dynamics on the julia set is wild and chaotic .    it may happen that there exists a periodic continuum in the julia set , where the first return map behaves like another rational map on its own julia set .",
    "the induced dynamical system is usually called a _",
    "renormalization_. it may also happen that a continuum in the julia set wanders around and forms a pairwise disjoint orbit .",
    "the continuum is usually called a _ wandering continuum_.    many existing decomposition results can be described by stable multicurves . for a polynomial with a disconnected julia set",
    "such that only finitely many filled julia components contain post - critical points , one can extract a stable multicurve from a finite pullback of an equipotential curve in the basin of infinity .",
    "this stable multicurve forms a tableau under pullback .",
    "the pioneering work of branner - hubbard on cubic polynomials uses this tableau to show that the filled julia set consists of components that are either pullbacks of renormalizations or points @xcite . later on demarco and pilgrim",
    "also use this tableau and an infinite tree to encode the combination of these points and renormalization copies @xcite .    for polynomials with connected julia sets",
    "there are similar decomposition results .",
    "often there are more than one periodic external rays landing at a common periodic point .",
    "these periodic external rays cut the julia set into pieces .",
    "together with equipotential curves , these rays play the role of a stable multicurve and form puzzles . as before the dynamics on a periodic puzzle piece is a renormalization . in various expanding cases ,",
    "the remaining part of the julia set , after extracting the renormalized copies and their pullbacks , consists of uncountable many point components .",
    "see for example @xcite , among others .    for non - polynomial rational maps ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "there is an example of hyperbolic rational maps whose julia set is a cantor set of jordan curves @xcite .",
    "a jordan curve contained essentially in an annular fatou domain forms a stable multicurve .",
    "in general , if a sub - hyperbolic rational map has a disconnected julia set , one can also extract a stable multicurve in the multiply - connected fatou domains and obtain a canonical decomposition of the julia set .",
    "it turns out that every wandering component of the julia set is either a single point or a jordan curve , and there are only finitely many cycles of non - trivial periodic components of the julia set except the cycles of jordan curves",
    ". a detailed analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the situation of a rational map with a connected julia set is actually much harder . in some particular cases such as the newton s method for cubic polynomials , or quadratic rational maps with a @xmath0-periodic critical point",
    ", rays from distinct fatou basins may join together at their landing points and form graphs to cut apart the julia set ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but this is by far the general case .",
    "for instance there are julia sets homeomorphic to a sierpinski carpet , in which any two distinct fatou domains have disjoint closures .",
    "the julia set of a post - critically finite rational map is automatically connected .",
    "conversely , any sub - hyperbolic rational map with a connected julia set is quasi - conformally conjugate to a post - critically finite rational map in a neighborhood of the julia set .",
    "there is already a well - known combinatorial decomposition for post - critically finite maps , in case that the map has a fully invariant jordan curve up to homotopy .",
    "cutting along this curve will decompose the rational map ( or its second iteration if necessary ) into two polynomials .",
    "the rational map is called the mating of the two polynomials .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "however , the decomposed polynomials can not be considered as renormalizations in the usual sense . in general none of the small julia sets",
    "is embedded in the original big julia set .",
    "distinct tips of a small julia set are often identified under mating @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will establish a new type of decomposition procedure for post - critically finite rational maps .",
    "the first challenge is to find a natural class of multicurves to cut along .",
    "our key concept , _ cantor multicurves _ , is introduced precisely for this purpose .",
    "contrary to the equator of a mating , a cantor multicurve is a multicurve whose consecutive pullbacks will generate a strictly increasing number of curves in each homotopy class .",
    "the stability of multicurves is only measured up to homotopy .",
    "the crucial step in our study is to promote a cantor multicurve to a multi - annulus such that it is exactly invariant in a sense defined later on .",
    "we will call such a dynamical system an _ exact annular system_. this is to be compared to the monograph @xcite , where stable multicurves are promoted to invariant jordan curves in the setting of branched coverings .",
    "it will play the role of multiply - connected fatou components in the disconnected case , and will allow us to decompose the julia set into pairwise disjoint pieces .",
    "cantor multicurves and exact annular systems appear naturally in the study of rational maps with disconnected julia sets ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the connected julia set case",
    ", these concepts appear also in haissinsky - pilgrim s example @xcite .",
    "however they have never been applied to general post - critically finite rational maps .",
    "the dynamics of the exact annular sub - system is quite simple since it is expanding .",
    "similar to the disconnected julia set case we will prove that each component of its julia set is a jordan curve .",
    "there are uncountably many of such components .",
    "all but countably many of them are wandering .    the next step is to analyze the complement of the grand orbit of the julia set of the exact annular sub - system .",
    "it has countably many continuum components which are pullbacks of finitely many renormalizations and possibly uncountably many point components .",
    "finally , we will encode the induced dynamics on these decomposed components by an expanding dynamical system on a dendrite .",
    "we also present a new result about wandering continua . for a post - critically finite rational map ,",
    "the existence of a non - simply connected wandering continuum is equivalent to the existence of a cantor multicurve .",
    "moreover , the wandering continuum must be a jordan curve .",
    "it is known that for a polynomial with connected julia set and without irrational indifferent cycles , there are no wandering continua if and only if its julia set is locally connected @xcite .",
    "our final and somewhat independent task is to construct post - critically finite rational maps with cantor multicurves and prescribed renormalizations . for this purpose",
    "we will introduce a new surgery procedure which we call _ folding _ , to construct a branched covering from a polynomial .",
    "the resulting branched covering has a cantor multicurve consisting of a single curve .",
    "we will show that under certain conditions the branched covering is thurston equivalent to a rational map .",
    "consequently , this rational map has a cantor multicurve .",
    "hence it has wandering jordan curves and a renormalization whose straightening map is the polynomial we started with .",
