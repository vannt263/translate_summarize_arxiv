    "we distinguish two kinds of point defects , those where the number of atoms remains the same and those where one or more atoms are removed ( vacancies ) .",
    "for the first group of defects we can calculate the formation energy as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the total energies of the sample with and without the defect .",

    "recently , it has been suggested@xcite that sw defects in graphene are further stabilized by a sine - like or cosine - like buckle and that this finding should hold also for other hexagonal single - layer crystals . by starting with a flat layer with a sw defect , and raising the temperature to 10 k we find a spontaneous buckling to one of the two structures @xmath62 and @xmath63 shown in b ) and c ) respectively which resemble the sine - like buckle proposed in @xcite .",
    "we found the cosine - like buckle to be unstable and deform to the structure @xmath63 .",

    "the b atom moves to a metastable state with a slightly longer bn bond length ( 1.53 instead of 1.47 ) with the two neighbours and the formation of two loose b - b bonds with a large bond length ( 1.9 ) . no extended deviations in the z - direction occur for this defect ( see table [ table : for_energy_def ] ) .",
    "the formation energy ( @xmath64 ev ) is only @xmath65 ev higher than the tetrahedron defect ( c ) ) where a n atom pops up and form a nb@xmath66 tetrahedron with the three b atoms in the plane .",
    "also this defect does not lead to out of plane deformations in the surrounding .",
    "it has been suggested that a bn@xmath66 tetrahedron structure with one n atom on top could explain some features in core level spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "we find that this structure is unstable and that the b atom abandons the layer if lifted from the plane . in",
    "we show the energy profile for the bb and tetrahedron defects calculated by the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method , as implemented in lammps@xcite .",
    "we see that the barrier for the bb defect is @xmath6 ev higher than that of the tetrahedron defect . in b )",
    "we show also the antisite defect which is commonly found in semiconductors .",
    "as shown in table [ table : for_energy_def ] its formation energy is intermediate between those of the bb and tetrahedron defects and those of the sw defects .    in table",
    "[ table : for_energy_def ] we also give the maximum out of plane displacement and the average value of out of plane displacements in the whole sample .",
    "we can see that , with the exception of the antisite defect , the formation energy seems to be related to the out of plane distortions , as suggested for grain boundaries in graphene@xcite .",
    "lastly , we consider the various vacancies occurring when one or more atoms are removed .",
    "we define the vacancy giving as subscript the removed atoms , e.g. @xmath67 as a system missing one n atom . apart from the @xmath68 vacancy that keeps the stoichiometry , for these cases the evaluation of the formation energy requires to know the chemical potential of bulk phases of the constituents@xcite .",
    "different formation energies can result from use of different reference systems",
    ". moreover , the chemical potential is often approximated by the cohesive energy , i.e. its value at @xmath1@xcite .",
    "for bn , the formation energy of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 vacancies has been calculated ab - initio in @xcite by use of the chemical potentials of bulk metallic boron and solid nitrogen . as discussed in ref.@xcite , this approach is not reliable for a phenomenological potential like the one we are using",
    ". therefore in table [ table : for_energy_vac ] we just give the energy difference @xmath71 between the energy of the perfect sample ( @xmath72 ) and the one of the sample relaxed after creation of the vacancy .",
    "we notice that @xmath73 and @xmath67 have the same @xmath71 because they both involve three bn broken bonds .",
    "once the vacancy is created , no new bonds are formed .",
    "the three atoms surrounding the vacancy remain two - fold coordinated with the same bond angle . the bond length with the two nearest neighbours contracts from 1.46   to 1.44  .    since",
    ", the single vacancies @xmath67 and @xmath73 have the same @xmath71 , we have a qualitative indication of the formation energy by subtracting from @xmath71 the cohesive energy for each removed atom , irrespective of its nature , namely @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of missing atoms .",
    "also for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 we find that no new bonds are formed after creation of the vacancy and that the structural changes are negligible . in table",
    "[ table : for_energy_vac ] we give the corresponding values of @xmath71 and @xmath76 . to establish whether these are indeed the lowest energy structures , we have brought the atoms around the vacancy closer to each other inducing the formation of new bonds re - establishing three - fold coordination as shown in for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "all these structures remain bonded after relaxation but have higher energy than the ones with no rebonding .",
    "this is due to the strong n - n bonds of only @xmath77 in @xmath68 and @xmath69 that cause strong local out of plane distortions and hinder the ring formation . indeed ,",
    "the ring structure of the @xmath69 vacancy shown in b ) is obtained by construction and does not occur spontaneously whereas the @xmath70 , with no n - n bonds , may form spontaneously at finite temperature since it has an energy only marginally higher than the one without rebonding .",
    "in summary , we have presented an extended study of the structural properties of single layer _ h_-bn by means of md simulations based on the interatomic potential developed by albe , mller and heinig and compared our findings to those for graphene .",
    "validation of the results given by this potential opens the way to the development of a reliable potential capable to deal with hybrid bn - graphene structures .",
    "we find that the non - monotonic behaviour of the lattice parameter , the expansion of the interatomic distance and the growth of the bending rigidity with temperature are qualitatively similar to those of graphene .",
    "conversely , the energetics of point defects is extremely different : stone wales defects have formation energy twice as large as the two lowest energy defects in _ h_-bn which involve either a broken bond or an out of plane displacement of a n atom to form a tetrahedron with three b atoms in the plane .",
    "we have also studied the antisite defect and vacancies formed by one , two and four atoms .",
