    "some of the most intriguing research problems in the field of strongly correlated electrons concern the coexistence of superconductivity ( sc ) with itinerant antiferromagnetism , namely the spin density wave ( sdw ) state@xcite .",
    "most of the electronic systems that have been proposed to exhibit such a coexisting phase , are thought to be unconventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "the quasi one - dimensional organic salts based on tmtsf were the the first to exhibit clearly the proximity of the sdw state with sc @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments on the same salts have established that there is a region of macroscopic coexistence of these two phases @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena have also been oberved in organic quasi-2d superconductors like @xmath0 , high-@xmath1 oxides in the underdoped regime and heavy - fermion compounds such as uranium based @xmath2 , @xmath3 or cerium based @xmath4 just to name a few@xcite .",
    "many controversies still remain about the type of sc involved , and in particular whether sc is singlet or triplet .    in the present paper",
    "we study the coexistence of singlet d - wave sc with sdw and in particular we focus on the induced staggered triplet sc component and new behavior that may result because of the presence of these _ three _ order parameters .",
    "several studies of the competition of unconventional sc with sdw and the possibility of an emergent staggered @xmath5 pairing are available @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite scattering by non - magnetic impurities is shown to stabilize a phase with all three order parameters ( ops ) whereas in @xcite the induced @xmath6-pairing is studied in the context of deviations from half - filling .",
    "we associate here for the first time the coexistence and competition of the above triplet of phases with the recent experimental evidence of a fulde ferrel larkin ovchinikov ( fflo ) @xcite state in the high field - low temperature phase diagram regime of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this quasi-2d compound has remarkable features separating it from other hf superconductors , such as the highest sc @xmath1 among all ce and u compounds .",
    "it s gap symmetry is considered to be d - wave and it s fermi surface consists of quasi - cylindrical sheets ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "there is no clear evidence up to now for afm ordering in @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , it s proximity to @xmath4 , which is an afm uncoventional superconductor@xcite , and recent nmr experiments suggest that @xmath7 is close to a magnetic quantum critical point situated at a slightly negative pressure@xcite .    using a eight component spinor formalism and a mean - field approach we study the influence of varying temperature , doping and external magnetic field on the competition of d - wave singlet sc with sdw and staggered @xmath5 sc .",
    "we have considered only the zeeman splitting of an in - plane magnetic field which is the relevant term in the context of a fflo formulation in a thin film superconductor whose thickness is smaller than its coherence length . in such a case",
    "orbital effects can safely be neglected .",
    "the layered @xmath7 meets well these requirements .",
    "bearing in mind the above , we show how particle - hole asymmetry mixes the above states as proposed before in slightly different contexts .",
    "most importantly , we produce novel field - induced transitions that bear remarkable similarities with the experimentally observed fflo phases .",
    "our starting point is the generalized mean - field hamiltonian which corresponds to the coexistence of d - wave singlet sc , @xmath6-triplet ( or * q*-triplet ) sc and sdw order parameters under the influence of an external magnetic field : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are spin indices , @xmath10,@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the sdw , the d - wave singlet sc and the @xmath6-triplet sc order parameters respectively , @xmath13 is the zeeman term for a static uniform field and @xmath14 is the polarization of the sdw which is taken _ parallel _ to that of the @xmath6-triplet sc spins and the external magnetic field .",
    "we have chosen the z - axis components for our calculations .",
    "for the odd in momentum spin triplet sc order parameter ( op ) we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the triplet sc component that we consider is _ staggered _ , meaning that the sc pairs have a finite momentum .",
    "similar @xmath6 operators were introduced in the past , i.e. by yang sun et al . in an su(4 ) model for htc superconductivity@xcite , but , to our knowledge were first discussed by psaltakis @xcite .    in the two - dimensional tetragonal system that we consider here ,",
    "the transformations with respect to @xmath17 are fundamental .",
    "the wavevector @xmath18 is commensuratemeaning that translations from @xmath19 to @xmath20 brings us back at the same place of the bz .",
    "the electronic dispersion can be generically decomposed into periodic and antiperiodic terms with respect to @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here , as an example , we assume a single band tight - binding dispersion where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for @xmath27 the system is particle - hole symmetric and perfectly nested at the wavevector * q*. when @xmath28(@xmath29 ) the system is considered e(h)-doped and deviates from perfect nesting .    in order to treat all order parameters on the same footing we adopt an eight component spinor space formalism defined by the following spinor@xcite : @xmath30 the following tensor products @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the pauli matrices , form a convenient basis for the projection of the hamiltonian in this eight component spinor space .    in the above formalism and assuming all ops real",
    ", our mean - field hamiltonian is rewritten in the compact form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the matrix of the system eigenenergies .",
    "the corresponding propagator reads : @xmath35\\otimes\\\\\\nonumber \\bigl[\\left(b({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)+8h\\mu_{{\\rm b}}\\left(-m_{\\bi{k } } \\delta_{\\bi{k}}\\pi_{\\bi{k}}+\\delta_{\\bi{k}}\\left(\\delta_{\\bi{k}}^2 + \\pi_{\\bi{k}}^2+\\omega^2\\right)\\right)\\hat{\\sigma}_3\\right)\\hat{\\tau}_2\\\\\\nonumber -8h\\mu_{{\\rm b}}\\hat{\\rho}_1\\bigl(\\hat{\\sigma}_2\\bigl(m_{\\bi{k } } \\delta_{\\bi{k}}\\delta_{\\bi{k}}+\\left(\\gamma_{\\bi{k}}^2-\\delta_{\\bi{k}}^2 + \\delta_{\\bi{k}}^2-h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\right)\\pi_{\\bi{k}}\\\\\\nonumber -h\\mu_{{\\rm b}}\\left(\\delta_{\\bi{k}}\\delta_{\\bi{k}}-m_{\\bi{k } } \\pi_{\\bi{k}}\\right)\\hat{\\tau}_1\\bigl)-\\gamma_{\\bi{k } } \\left(\\delta_{\\bi{k}}\\delta_{\\bi{k}}-m_{\\bi{k}}\\pi_{\\bi{k}}\\right)\\hat{\\sigma}_1\\hat{\\tau}_2\\bigl)\\\\ -4a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)h\\mu_{{\\rm b}}\\left(\\delta_{\\bi{k } } \\hat{\\sigma}_3\\hat{\\tau}_2-\\pi_{\\bi{k } } \\hat{\\rho}_1\\hat{\\sigma}_2\\right ) \\bigl]\\times d({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the poles of the green function are the following : @xmath37 from the above we see that the @xmath38 term , when non - zero , induces additional terms that may help in the formation of new fermi sheets when one of the branches goes to zero .",
    "after projecting the above propagator on the different particle - hole and particle - particle channels , we arrive at the following system of coupled self - consistent equations obeyed by the three ops : @xmath39\\biggl\\}\\times d({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)\\\\{\\nonumber}\\fl \\delta_{\\bi{k}}=t\\sum_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\sum_nv_{{\\bi{k}\\bi{k}'}}^{dsc } \\bigg\\{\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\biggl(-c({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)+ 2a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)^2\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\\\{\\nonumber}-4a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\left(\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2- h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2 + 5\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2+\\omega_n^2\\right)+ 8\\bigl[3 m_{{\\bi{k } } ' } \\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^3 \\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' }   \\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\\\{\\nonumber}-3m_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^3- \\left(\\gamma_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2+\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2\\right ) \\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^4 + \\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 \\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 ( 3 \\gamma_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 + 4 \\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\\\{\\nonumber}-3 h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2 + 3 \\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2)- \\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^4(\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2-h^2 \\mu_{{\\rm b } } ^2 + 3 \\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2)- \\bigl(\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^4+h^2 \\mu_{{\\rm b } } ^2 \\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2\\\\{\\nonumber}+\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2\\bigl(h^2 \\mu_{{\\rm b } } ^2 - 3\\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2\\bigl)\\bigl ) \\omega_n ^2\\bigl]\\biggl)+2\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } m_{{\\bi{k } } ' } \\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\bigl[a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)^2 - 4 \\bigl(\\gamma_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 \\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2\\\\ + h^2 \\mu_{{\\rm b } } ^2 \\left(\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 + \\omega_n ^2\\right)-\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 \\left(\\pi_{{\\bi{k } } ' } ^2 + \\omega_n ^2\\right)\\bigl)\\bigl]\\biggl\\}\\times d({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)\\\\{\\nonumber}\\fl \\pi_{\\bi{k}}=t\\sum_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\sum_nv_{{\\bi{k}\\bi{k}'}}^{qtr } \\bigg\\{-\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\biggl(c({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)-2a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)^2 \\left(\\gamma_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2+\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\right)+4a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n ) \\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\\\{\\nonumber}\\cdot\\left(5\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2-h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2+\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2 + \\omega_n^2\\right)+8\\bigl[-3m_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^3\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } \\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}+3m_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^3\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\\\{\\nonumber}+\\gamma_{{\\bi{k}}'}^4\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2+\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^4\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2 + h^2\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\omega_n^2 + \\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^4\\left(3\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2- h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2+\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2+\\omega_n^2\\right)\\\\{\\nonumber}+\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\left(-3\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^4 + h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\omega_n^2+\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\left(3h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2- 4\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2 - 3\\omega_n^2\\right)\\right)\\\\{\\nonumber}+\\gamma_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\bigl(3m_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k } } ' } \\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}+2\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2 + h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\omega_n^2-\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\bigl(3\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2- h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\\\{\\nonumber}+2\\pi_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2+\\omega_n^2\\bigl)\\bigl)\\bigl]\\biggl)+2m_{{\\bi{k } } ' } \\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}\\bigl(a({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)^2 - 4h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2\\omega_n^2\\\\ + 4\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2\\left(\\delta_{{\\bi{k}}'}^2-h^2\\mu_{{\\rm b}}^2 + \\omega_n^2\\right)\\bigl)\\biggl\\}\\times d({\\bi{k}}',\\omega_n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40    close inspection of the above equations reveals that they have the following structure : @xmath41 on the right hand side of each of the gap equations , there are terms which _ are not proportional to the gap of the left hand side_. when there is particle - hole asymmetry , then if two of the order parameters are non - zero , zero is not a trivial self - consistent solution for the third order parameter which has to be non - zero as well .",
    "furthermore , the induced term by p - h asymmetry is even in frequency , so we expect it not to vanish after the summation on the matsubara frequencies .",
    "therefore , in the presence of both sdw and d - wave singlet sc orderings , _ particle - hole asymmetry would imply the presence of a staggered @xmath6-triplet sc component_. similar arguments are presented in @xcite in a slightly different context . here",
    "we stress out that _ partcle - hole asymmetry _ or the @xmath38 term does the mixing .",
    "the summations on the matsubara frequencies are done analytically and the self - consistent gap equations on the real axis were solved numerically to illustrate the mixing of the three order parameters .",
    "we assume a tight - binding dispersion relation on a two dimensional square lattice up to the n.n.neighbours .",
    "we set the nearest neighbors hopping term @xmath42 and vary the n.n term @xmath43 which is the relevant parameter for particle - hole asymmetry or doping . the value of @xmath44 sets the energy scale in our calculations .",
    "the effective potentials are generally decomposed into a momentum dependent part , which includes any proper form factos , and a constant part which sets the amplitude of the coupling strength .",
    "we emphasize that in this study the sdw component is taken isotropic and the sc components anisotropic assuming a d - wave pairing . as an interesting example",
