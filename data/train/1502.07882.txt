    "blazars are a class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) whose jets are pointing near the line of sight to the observer @xcite , and are known for showing the most rapid variability of all agns .",
    "extensive observations indicate that the jets of blazars are relativistic .",
    "their most remarkable characteristic is the presence of flares in the x- and @xmath0-ray bands , usually wih a duration of the order of a few hours .",
    "the internal shock ( is ) model @xcite , invoked to explain this variability @xcite , is an idealized model where an intermittently working central engine ejects shells of magnetized plasma which collide due to their velocity differences . as a consequence internal shocks",
    "are formed , accelerating particles at the shock fronts and producing the non - thermal , highly variable radiation .",
    "our long - term objective for is the study of the influence of the magnetic field on the observed emission using numerical simulations . in @xcite",
    "we studied a large number of shell collisions with different magnetization levels .",
    "in @xcite we focused on a limited number of parameters such as the observer viewing angle , @xmath1 , the bulk lorentz factor of the slower shell , @xmath2 , and the relative lorentz factor , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bulk lorentz factor of the faster shell . in the present work",
    "we summarize some of the results studied therein .",
    "we describe the common numerical setup in sec .",

    "[ results ] and discussed in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "a modified version of the code spev @xcite was employed to calculate the non - thermal emission from iss .",
    "we assume a cylindrical shell geometry and perform all the calculations in the rest frame of the shocked fluid ( rfsf ) .",
    "the shell interaction was simplified as a one - dimensional riemann problem and focus our resources on a more detailed treatment of the non - thermal radiation .",
    "our method consists of three steps that we sum up in the following paragraphs .",
    "_ solution of the riemann problem .",
    "_ employing an exact relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) riemann solver we determine the properties of the internal shock waves .",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite to set - up the shells and to extract the information needed for the steps 2 and 3 .",

    "the particles are injected behind the shock fronts following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we assume that a fraction of the thermal electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution at high energies , and that their energy density is a fraction of the internal energy density of the shocked fluid . in the rfsf",
    "the shocks are propagating away from the initial discontinuity , injecting and leaving non - thermal particles behind .",
    "we evolve the energy distribution of non - thermal electrons taking into account synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) losses .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "_ radiative transfer .",
    "_ the total emissivity at each point is assumed to be a combination of the following emission processes : ( 1 ) synchrotron radiation , ( 2 ) ic upscattering of an internal ( ssc ) and an external radiation field ( eic ) .",
    "we group our models according to the initial shell magnetization , @xmath5 .",
    "hereafter the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 will denote left ( faster ) and right ( slower ) shells , respectively .",

    "ssc and ec components are shown as dashed , dot - dashed and dot - dot - dashed lines , respectively , but now for the models with @xmath17 .",
    "the synchrotron component for @xmath18 is @xmath19 times brighter than the ssc one , in contrast to the ec which is @xmath20 times dimmer . for @xmath21 the ec",
    "is of the same order of magnitude of ssc and synchrotron .",
    "the latter two decrease one order of magnitude between the models with @xmath18 and @xmath4 , while the ec grows by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "this follows from the fact that the number of electrons and the comoving magnetic field strength decrease with the increasing @xmath2 @xcite , which means that there are less synchrotron photons and less electrons which can scatter them in the ssc process .",
    "we model the klein - nishina cutoff as a sharp cutoff , and its effect can be seen at @xmath22hz , where all the ec spectra coincide . from the inset",
