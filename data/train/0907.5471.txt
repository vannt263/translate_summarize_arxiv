    "the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of nearby galaxies reveal the details of stellar evolutionary processes , if our eyesight is keen enough . in recent years",
    "both the data and theory have made considerable advances .",
    "on the one hand , large format ccd cameras have allowed comprehensive photometry of the resolved stellar content of nearby galaxies , such as that of the local group galaxy survey ( lggs ) , which imaged those local group galaxies with active star formation ( massey et al .",
    "2006 , 2007a , 2007b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "recent advances in stellar evolutionary theory have demonstrated the important role that rotation plays in the evolution of massive stars ( see , for example , maeder & meynet 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2003 , 2005 ) .    consider the optical cmd of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] _",
    "upper_. the unevolved stars are found on the left , in the section labeled  blue supergiants \"",
    ". however , this  blue plume \" in such diagrams actually contain a mix of both unevolved main - sequence and more evolved blue supergiants ( freedman 1988 ) ; it also contains a smattering of wolf - rayet stars , the evolved descendants of the most massive o - type stars .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have emphasized that the optically brightest stars in this region of the cmd are not , in fact , the most bolometrically luminous or massive  rather , the brightest stars are dominated by b- and a - type supergiants , while more massive ( and luminous ) o - type stars are fainter as most of their radiation lies in the far - uv .",
    "the central portion of the cmd contains the yellow supergiants , and at the extreme right , the red supergiants .",
    "but , redwards of the blue plume caution is advised in our interpretation , as foreground contamination may dominate .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : cmd ] _ lower _ by using the besancon model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) of the milky way to construct a theoretical cmd of the expected foreground contamination , using the same galactic coordinates as m31 , and covering the same area . for the bright stars ( @xmath5 ) redwards of the blue plume ( @xmath6 ) the foreground contamination is @xmath7% .",
    "note that the features in the m31  yellow plume \" area are well reproduced by the besancon model . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmdfore ] we break down this foreground contamination into its various components .",
    "the disk populations clearly dominates , but even among the brighter stars there will be some contamination by halo giants and sub - giants .    our group is engaged in the long - term process of characterizing the massive star populations of nearby galaxies from one side of the cmd to the other . in order to relate this to evolutionary theory , we must succeed in two things : first , to be able to clean foreground stars from the sample , and secondly to provide a transformation of observed properties to physical properties .",
    "we have recently undertaken this for the red supergiants of m31 ( massey et al .",
    "2009 ) ; here we turn our attention to the yellow supergiants .",
    "yellow supergiants ( f- and g - type ) are extremely rare , as they represent a very short - lived phase in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "their numbers and location in the h - r diagram ( hrd ) are very sensitive to the uncertain values of the mass - loss rates for massive stars , and how convection and other mixing processes are treated ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) . as kippenhahn & weigert ( 1990 ) put it ,  [ the yellow supergiant ] phase is a sort of magnifying glass , revealing relentlessly the faults of calculations of earlier phases . \"",
    "exactly how sensitive our expectations should be to the details of the models is illustrated by comparing the various geneva evolutionary models ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 ; schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ; maeder & meynet 2001 ; meynet & maeder 2003 , 2005 ) shown in figure  [ fig : models ] and the corresponding lifetimes for the yellow supergiant stage given in table  [ tab : ages ] and 25@xmath1 z=0.040 models of meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) were computed using a numerical simplification which resulted in the tracks turning back to the blue at too high an effective temperature ; here we use the recomputed versions mentioned in massey et al .",
    "we also include here newly completed @xmath8 models for 12@xmath1 and 15@xmath1 which include the effects of rotation . ] . the metallicities shown span a range of 10 , from sub - solar ( @xmath9 , typical of the smc ) to solar ( @xmath10 ) to super - solar ( @xmath8 , typical of m31 ) ; see massey ( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "solid curves denote the latest models computed with an assumed initial rotation of 300 km s@xmath11,the dashed curves are the latest models that include no initial rotation , and the dotted curves are the older , non - rotating models .",
    "since different versions ( rotating , newer non - rotating , older non - rotating ) of the same mass track differ in luminosity , we have color coded them for clarity ; the corresponding initial mass is shown in the same color .",
    "the two solid vertical lines denote the yellow supergiant region , which we define as having effective temperatures between 4800  k and 7500  k.    we see that in most cases the models predict a short pass through the yellow supergiant region as stars evolve from the ob main - sequence stage ( off the plot to the left ) over to the red supergiant ( rsg ) region on the right .",
    "however , in some cases , such as the evolutionary track that includes rotation ( solid curve ) for 25@xmath1 at galactic metallicity ( @xmath10 ) the star then evolves back to the blue side of the hrd . at higher masses ( 40 - 60@xmath1 )",
    "the models predict that a star will double back to the blue side while a yellow supergiant .",
    "the lifetimes for the yellow supergiant stage given in table  [ tab : ages ] are all very short , typically a few tens of thousands of years .",
    "the main sequence lifetimes of these stars are a few million years , so , in general , the yellow supergiant lifetimes are on the order of 1% or less . in the extreme cases ( lifetimes of the yellow supergiant phase of @xmath12 yr for a 12@xmath1 star with 15  myr lifetime ) it is of order 0.02% .",
    "we do see from table  [ tab : ages ] , however , exactly how sensitive these yellow supergiant lifetimes are to the exact treatments of the models . at galactic metallicities ,",
    "the models computed with an initial rotational speed of 300 km s@xmath11 (  s3 \" ) indicate a 10@xmath13 shorter yellow supergiant phase than models with the same assumptions but with no initial rotation (  s0 \" ) .",
    "there are also clearly differences in the expected _ locations _ of the yellow supergiants in the hrd , particularly those of the highest luminosities .",
    "according to the models , for instance , at @xmath14  dex we would expect to see some yellow supergiants at galactic ( @xmath10 ) metallicities , but only the hotter ones ( i.e. , @xmath156000  k ) , while at lower luminosities we should find stars populating throughout the region .",
    "the duration of the yellow supergiant phase is not significantly shorter for a higher mass ( luminosity ) star than for a lower mass ( luminosity ) star , according to table  [ tab : ages]if anything the opposite is true ",
    "so simply determining the upper luminosity limit to yellow supergiants at various metallicities would be of great interest for comparison with the models , as well as seeing if the number of higher mass yellow supergiants really comparable to that of lower masses .",
    "we emphasize that such a test is new , and avoids some of the selection biases that may dominate comparisons of one population of massive stars to another , such as comparing the number of yellow and red supergiants , or the number of red supergiants and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "although those tests are invaluable , they require a thorough understanding of the completeness of the surveys of such objects .",
    "we are making progress towards gathering the information that make such further tests possible ( see summary given by massey 2009 ) .",
    "we have previously found that it is straightforward to separate ( extragalactic ) red supergiants from ( foreground ) red dwarfs and giants by using a two - color diagram ( massey 1998a , massey et al .",
    "2009 ) , but this discrimination does not extend to the yellow supergiants . in figure  [ fig:2color ] _ ( upper ) _ we show the intrinsic color lines from fitzgerald ( 1970 ) . the dwarf sequence is shown in green , and the supergiant sequence in red .",
    "we have reddened the supergiant sequence slightly , by @xmath16 , corresponding to the typical reddening of a massive star in m31 ( massey et al .",
    "2007a ) ; this slight adjustment down and to the right is shown by the short bar in lower left .",
    "superimposed on this two - color diagram are the stars brighter than @xmath17 from the local group galaxies survey ( lggs ) photometry given by massey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for stars in m31 .    for the mid f - type stars ,",
    "there is a separation in the sense that for a given @xmath18 a supergiant will have a larger @xmath19 . for early a - type supergiants this trend",
    "is reversed ;",
    "i.e. , supergiants will have a more negative @xmath19 .",
    "however , as is clear from this plot there is little or no separation in the two - color diagram for supergiants of late a or early f , or for supergiants of late f through early k. examination of other colors ( using model atmospheres ) failed to identify any more suitable diagnostic two - color tool .",
    "it is also clear from distribution of points in this figure that the majority of blue stars are expected to be supergiants , while the majority of stars of later types may well be foreground , as we argued above .",
    "we illustrate this further in figure  [ fig:2color ] _ ( lower ) _ , where we have used the besancon simulation of the milky way ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) to show the expected distribution of foreground stars in such a diagram .",
    "the comparison between the two sides of the figures reveals where we expect foreground stars to dominate .",
    "given the lack of two - color discriminants , what then are our options to identify a relatively complete sample of yellow supergiants that can be used to test the stellar evolution models ?",
    "uncertain distances and reddening complicate the analysis of a galactic sample . in her compilation of 949 supergiants known in the milky way ,",
    "humphreys ( 1978 ) lists just 21 supergiants of spectral type f0-g9 i ( i.e. , about 2% ) .",
    "even so , several of these have dubious cluster memberships and , hence , uncertain luminosities . in the magellanic clouds",
    "there are less than a dozen spectroscopically confirmed f and g supergiants ( oestreicher & schmidt - kaler 1999 ) , although this deficiency may be largely due to the lack of adequate spectroscopic studies in the correct magnitude / color range , a situation we ourselves hope to remedy in the not too distant future .",
    "we have concluded that m31 provides the best laboratory for conducting such tests at present , as its kinematics allow us to overcome the problems posed by foreground contamination of its cmd .",
    "m31 possesses a large negative systemic velocity ( @xmath20 km s@xmath11 ) and a high rotation rate ( 240 km s@xmath11 ) , making it relatively straightforward to demonstrate membership based on radial velocities .",
    "gilbert et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and koch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) similarly used radial velocities to separate m31 s red giant members from foreground contamination .",
    "the recent lggs photometry of m31 ( massey et al .",
    "2006 ) provides the means for selecting candidate stars for radial velocities , and for transforming intrisic colors to physical properties .    in this paper",
    "we conduct a census of yellow supergiants in m31 , establishing membership , determining physical properties , and making comparisons with the current generation of evolutionary tracks . in   [ os ]",
    "we describe our data and reduction . in ",
    "[ a ] we illustrate the process by which we separated foreground dwarfs from m31 s yellow supergiants , and in ",
    "[ hr ] we present the comparison of our results to the current evolutionary tracks .",
    "we provide discussion and lay out our thoughts for future work in   [ fut ] .",
    "in order to separate yellow foreground dwarfs from the yellow supergiants , we used the hectospec 300 fiber spectrograph on the 6.5-m mmt telescope to obtain radial velocities for @xmath21 stars . in this section",
    "we describe the sample selection , data acquisition , and reductions .",
    "our sample of objects was selected to have @xmath22 ( roughly corresponding to @xmath23 ) to provide adequate signal - to - noise for our spectroscopy .",
    "the color range was originally restricted to @xmath24 with @xmath25 in accordance with the range of @xmath18 for which dwarfs and supergiants can not be distinguished photometrically ; however , we found that relaxing the color range to @xmath26 added only a small percentage of additional stars .",
    "our other selection criteria was based upon the need to be able to distinguish the m31 yellow supergiants from foreground disk dwarfs based upon their radial velocities .",
    "inspection of the atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen by hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) shows that m31 ( at @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) clearly stands out from the galactic clutter at a radial velocity of -150 km s@xmath11 ( see hartmann & burton 1997 , p. 87 ) , but is somewhat confused by -100 km s@xmath11 ( pp .",
    "95 , 97 ) .",
    "we therefore decided to restrict our observations to those areas in m31 where the radial velocities should be @xmath29 -150 km @xmath11 . for computing the expected radial velocity corresponding to a position in m31 , we used rubin & ford ( 1970 ) , the seminal paper on the rotation of m31 . a least - squares linear fit to the radial velocities of the hii regions yields the expected radial velocities vel@xmath30 @xmath31 where x is the distance along the semi - major axis , and r is the radial distance of the object within the plane of m31 .",
    "we found that this approximation works well , producing good agreement with the more complex two dimension velocity field ( sofue & kato 1981 ) , and with other recent approximations ( hurley - keller et al .",
    "the radial velocities of red supergiants in m31 also agrees well with this simple relationship ( massey et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the result of this selection criterion is that not all of the area surveyed in the lggs was included in our sample : stars along the south - west half of the semi - major axis of m31 ( @xmath32 ) will have radial velocities of @xmath0 @xmath33 km s@xmath11 , but stars along the north - east half of the semi - major axis ( @xmath34 ) will have radial velocities of @xmath35 km s@xmath11 , more positive than our selection criterion of @xmath36 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the distribution of stars in our sample is shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] , where the  jaws \" in the north - east ( upper left ) are due to stars near the semi - major axis having smaller @xmath37 values then those seen along the edge of the disk . in all our sample covered 1.6 deg@xmath38 of the 2.2 deg@xmath38 of the lggs survey ( i.e. , about 73% ) .",
    "we were concerned that a few legitimate f or g supergiants _ might _ be too bright to be included in the lggs photometry , particularly due to saturation in the @xmath37 filter around @xmath39 .",
    "we therefore supplemented the lggs data with 163 bright ( @xmath40 ) stars from the survey of magnier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in order",
    "prevent mixing bright and faint stars in the same observations , we then divided our overall catalogs into a  bright \" catalog ( 349 stars with @xmath40 ) and a  faint \" catalog ( 3994 stars with @xmath41 ) , with 61 objects in common . due to the constraints of the fiber configurations , not all the objects could be observed , but we did manage to observe 68% of the 4282 catalog targets .",
    "hectospec is a 300 optical fiber fed spectrograph ( fabricant et al .",
    "2005 ) on the mmt 6.5-m telescope .",
    "observations are obtained in an innovative queue mode where the observers are the astronomers who were awarded time , but with the observing program for a given night determined by a queue manager .",
    "the observers are ably assisted by one of two professional instrument operators , in addition to the telescope operator .",
    "this  collective \" approach spreads out the effects of poor weather throughout the observing season , reducing the impact on any one program .",
    "our observations were all carried out on eight nights during october 2007 and one night in november 2007 .",
    "the 600 line mm@xmath11 grating was used , providing a dispersion of 0.55   pixel@xmath11 and a ( 5 pixel ) spectral resolution of 2.8  . the wavelength coverage",
    "extended from 4550 - 7050  .",
    "the fiber configuration files were constructed prior to the observations .",
    "the instrument has a 1@xmath42 field of view , a reasonable match to the 3 - 4@xmath42 angular extent of the optical disk of m31 ( hodge 1981 ) .",
    "our observations consisted of observing a single configuration for each of the five fields containing the brighter stars (  brt \" fields ) , and multiple configurations of three fields containing the fainter stars (  fnt \" fields ) , as listed in table  [ tab : fields ] . observations each  brt \" configuration consisted of 3 consecutive exposures of 10 minutes each , while observations of the  fnt \" configurations consisted of 3 consecutive exposures of 15 minutes each . in the end",
    ", we obtained 3116 spectra of 2901 of our catalog targets .    owing to the logistics of the queue observations , calibration exposures ( flat field and he - ne - ar )",
    "were taken only in the afternoon , and subsequent to that the grating might have been tilted to a different angle to accommodate other programs , or even removed entirely and then replaced for our observations .",
    "we deal with this complication as described below .",
    "we also needed observations of stars that could serve as templates for the cross - correlation .",
    "since the 600 line mm@xmath11 is not commonly used , we obtained our own observations of three radial velocity standards , hd 196850 , hd 194071 , and hd 213014 .",
    "hd 213014 was observed on four different nights .",
    "the data were all reduced using the  hectospec \" iraf package , designed specifically for this instrument ( mink et al .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted , trimmed , and a bad pixel extrapolation was performed using pre - existing bad pixel maps .",
    "the flat field exposures were extracted for each fiber and normalized in order to make the pixel - to - pixel corrections .",
    "the he - ne - ar arc exposures were then extracted , and used to make a dispersion solution .",
    "a sixth order chebyshev function was used for this , resulting in typically 0.04   residuals .",
    "the program exposures were extracted , using the dome flat field exposures as reference , and wavelength corrected . as the he - ne - ar exposures were obtained in the afternoon , and the grating might even be removed and reinserted before the program exposures , a zero - point shift in wavelength was determined for each of the m31 spectra using the o i @xmath43 night sky line .",
    "( as explained below , no such correction could be made for the very short exposures of the radial velocity standards . ) consecutive exposures of each m31 configuration were then summed , after cosmic rays were first identified and removed by comparing a median of the exposures to the individual exposures .",
    "for sky subtraction , each fiber had to be first be corrected for its own wavelength dependent throughput , using either the dome flat exposures , or , preferably , twilight exposures , if the latter had been obtained .",
    "each m31 configuration contained both preselected  clean \" sky positions plus random locations that might prove clean enough to be used as a measure of the sky .",
    "for each program spectrum 6 of these sky spectra were selected .",
    "these were taken from positions nearby on the array in order to reduce any scattered light component .",
    "these skys were then used to construct an average sky for subtraction using the singular value decomposition method ( mink & kutz 2001 ) .",
    "no sky subtraction was needed for the bright radial velocity standards .",
    "the radial velocities of our 2901 program objects were obtained through a cross - correlation with suitable radial velocity standards .",
    "all cross - correlations were performed in the iraf package  fxcor \" , which computes radial velocities via fourier cross - correlation using a gaussian to find the center and width of the calibration peak , following the method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) . before",
    "the cross - correlations were computed , each individual spectrum had its continuum removed by first normalizing and then subtracting 1.0 .",
    "the normalization was done interactively , using a 12th order cubic spline fit to the continuum .",
    "the cross - correlations were restricted to the range 4750 - 5550   and 5600 - 6800   in order to avoid the strongest night - sky emission .    as mentioned above , although the [ o i ] @xmath43 emission line was adequate to correct the program spectra for the wavelength zero - point ( necessitated by the logistics of the queue ) there was , ironically , no equivalent way to correct the radial velocity  standards \" . in order to resolve this issue , we used two velocity templates , created for a related project , generated from 270 line mm@xmath11 hectospec observations ( caldwell et al .",
    "the templates were created by first deriving an initial velocity from library templates ( typically a k giant star ) for spectra selected from a catalog of m31 star clusters .",
    "the spectra were shifted to zero velocity and sorted into crude spectral bins ( f- and k - type ) at which point the best spectra from each type were then combined to make new templates and the whole process repeated . when we cross - correlated our `` rv - standards '' with these templates , the velocities produced by the two templates varied by @xmath29 1.1 km s@xmath11 for all six observations . a third template , based upon early - type spectra ( a - type ) gave a velocity @xmath05 km s@xmath11 more positive , and we chose not to use it .",
    "in order to obtain suitable velocities for the radial velocity standards the relative velocities of the standards to the templates were obtained via cross - correlation and corrected to heliocentric velocities .",
    "we were very pleased to find this process yielded velocities that agreed with the iau adopted velocities to better than 5 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this indicates that if we had simply adopted the standard velocities , with _ no _ corrections , the resulting error would not have been large enough to affect our results .    as a final check of our newly adopted velocities ,",
    "the standards were cross - correlated against each other .",
    "hd194071 and the four observations of hd213014 all produced velocities within 0.2 km s@xmath11 of the standard value value , and within 0.1 km s@xmath11 of each other .",
    "hd196850 , however , consistently produced velocities 0.5 km s@xmath11 more positive .",
    "although this value is not significant compared to the expected radial velocity difference between m31 yellow supergiants and galactic yellow dwarfs , it still prompted us to reject our spectrum of hd196850 as a radial velocity standard template .",
    "we then performed cross correlations of the five spectra of the radial velocity standards against each of the 3116 spectra of the 2901 program objects .",
    "there were four objects for which our cross - correlations initially failed : j004101.24 + 410434.6 , j004129.31 + 40502.9 , j004203.63 + 405705.8 , and j004459.11 + 412732.7 .",
    "the spectra of all four objects were examined and strong nebular emission in the region of h@xmath44 was evident .",
    "when this region was excluded good correlations were found for j004101.24 + 410434.6 , and j004129.31 + 40502.9 , although their associated error was about twice as large as the average value of the other program objects .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : spectra ] examples of two of our spectra , and their resulting cross - correlation functions and corresponding fits .",
    "these were selected to have @xmath45 magnitudes typical of the median value in our entire sample , 17.1 .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : all ] the observed radial velocity of each of our 2889 objects , some of which had multiple observations .",
    "what are the corresponding errors ?",
    "each observed radial velocity @xmath46 is the average of cross - correlating the star s spectrum against that of the five radial velocity standard spectra .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean of these is always very small , of order a few tenths of a km s@xmath11 .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise in the standard templates is extremely high , and the standards are of similar type , so the differences in the velocities obtained from cross - correlating the same spectrum against these different standard spectra will certainly underestimate the true uncertanty .",
    "tonry & davis ( 1979 ) instead introduce the @xmath47 parameter , which is the ratio of the peak of the correlation function to its noise .",
    "we can estimate the relationship between @xmath47 and the error by using measurements obtained for stars observed multiple times .",
    "the 128 objects in the brt5 - 1 field were observed on two separate nights , and in addition , there were 28 objects in common between the  bright \" and  faint \" fields , plus 59 objects observed in multiple  faint \" fields .",
    "we find that in general our velocity error ( in km s@xmath11 ) is given by @xmath48 where the functional form reflects both errors in the standard star velocities and in uncertainties due to the cross - correlation ( see tonry & davis 1979 ) .",
    "the typical ( median ) @xmath47 value for our data is 33 , corresponding to a 2.6 km s@xmath11 error .    as a further check , in figure  [ b5compare ]",
    "we compare the velocities obtained from the two observations of the brt5 - 1 field .",
    "we find that there is an excellent match between the observations over all the velocities we ve sampled . as mentioned above ,",
    "this was not the case when we originally used the low - dispersion templates , where we saw a velocity - dependent problem .",
    "for all future purposes in the paper , the velocities produced during multiple observations were averaged to yield one vel@xmath49 for each program object .",
    "it is clear that a few stars have variable velocities based on this comparison ; we expect these stars to be binaries .",
    "if two observations of the same star differed by 10 km s@xmath11 or more we note this fact in table  [ tab : all ] .",
    "since we will be using the supergiants we identify to test if the models predict the same relative number with luminosity , we should understand what magnitude biases exist , if any , in the subsample of targets for which we obtained radial velocities compared to the parent sample . in figure  [ fig : magcomp ] we show the distribution of magnitudes in the complete sample of 4282 objects which met our original criteria ( magnitude , color , and location ) in black .",
    "the red ( dashed ) histogram shows the sample of 2989 objects for which we successfully obtained radial velocities .",
    "we show this on a log plot so that a linear difference corresponds to a percentage ; i.e. , a difference of 0.3  dex is a factor of 2 regardless of the absolute numbers .",
    "we find very good agreement , with only a slight tendency towards having obtained radial velocities for a larger percentage of brighter stars than fainter ones .",
    "this will introduce a slight bias in our final results in that higher luminosity stars should be proportionally over - represented in our sample .",
    "now armed with the observed radial velocities of our 2899 program objects , two main steps are necessary to identify the m31 yellow supergiants .",
    "first , foreground dwarf contaminants must be eliminated by determining which objects velocities match that expected from m31 s rotation curve and , second , once a list of m31 members has been obtained , any non - stellar objects ( i.e. , small clusters ) must be removed .    in the notation of rubin & ford ( 1970 ) , the radial velocity @xmath50 of an object in a disk galaxy can be approximated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the systemic radial velocity , @xmath53 is the angle between the line - of - sight and the perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , v(r ) is the rotation velocition within the plane at a radial distance r , and @xmath54 where x is the position along the major axis .",
    "this would be a linear relationship only if the rotation curve was absolutely flat i.e. v(r)= const .",
    "however , as mentioned in   [ ss ] this is a good approximation for m31 .",
    "we used the same fit , as described there , to compute what the radial velocity of each of our program objects _ should have been _ ( given its position on the sky ) were it an m31 member .",
    "the difference between our v@xmath49 and v@xmath30 for all objects was then calculated and plotted against v@xmath30 , as shown in figure  [ expectvdif ] .",
    "in figure  [ expectvdif ] , all the objects whose velocities correspond with m31 s rotation curve should lie along the zero point of the y axis .",
    "the left hand side of the plot , where the expected velocities are highly negative , represents the sw portion of m31 , rotating _ towards _ the milky way .",
    "thus , the strong diagonal band represents the foreground dwarfs ( objects with essentially zero radial velocity ) .",
    "as can be seen , the m31 members can easily be distinguished from the foreground dwarfs on the left side of the plot and the distinction becomes increasingly hazy as we move along m31 s semi - major axis .",
    "we therefore distinguish between two  ranks \" of m31 members .",

    "this was addressed by measuring the size of the objects as compared to nearby stars .",
    "we did this using two methods , both utilizing the images of the lggs .",

    "once the foreground contaminants and m31 clusters had been removed from our sample and our rank designations applied , we found that , out of our original sample of 2899 objects , we are left with 54 rank 1 and 66 rank 2 yellow supergiants .",
    "this corresponds to a foreground contamination between 96 - 98% !",
    "the velocity information for these 120 objects , as well as the seven m31 clusters ( listed at the end ) is summarized in table  [ tab : observed ] .",

    "we see that virtually all of the stars with observed velocities greater than @xmath65 km s@xmath11 are foreground objects , as expected . at @xmath66",
    "km s@xmath11 about half of the objects should be foreground , and half m31 .",
    "more negative than this , the m31 population dominates , with increasingly little foreground contamination .",

    "@xmath67 km s@xmath11 , and 1 foreground star with a radial velocity @xmath68 km @xmath11 .    we can also estimate this contamination independently using the bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) model which predicts about 40 halo dwarfs per square degree within the magnitude and color range we use in the direction of m31 . as for halo _ giants _ , the bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) model overestimates their number ( morrison 1993 ) , but heather morrision ( private communication ) has been kind enough to calculate that there should be about four such objects in a square degree seen towards m31 in this same magnitude and color range .",
    "the effective area in our survey is about 1 deg@xmath38 , and in it we observed 68% of the stars in our original sample , so we might realistically expect about 30 halo stars in our spectroscopic sample . assuming the radial velocity distribution is gaussian , this leads to the identical results as above : there should be 5 halo stars with velocities more negative than @xmath69 km s@xmath11 ( 0.94@xmath64 ) and 1 below @xmath70 km s@xmath11 ( 1.8@xmath64 ) .",

    "this region is indicated by the two horizontal lines in figure  [ atlas ] .",
    "we can see that over this temperature range there is substantial agreement between the models and the empirical calibrations .    as mentioned above",

    "we next show in figure  [ fig:2color3 ] the locations of our yellow supergiants in the two - color diagram .",
    "we see that , had we relied upon a two - color plot to eliminate yellow supergiant candidates , we would have missed a number whose @xmath19 colors are more negative than would be expected from the nominal supergiant sequence ( shown in red ) . of course",
    ", it could be that some of the stars with @xmath6 but @xmath115 will turn out to be foreground upon additional spectroscopy as none of the four rank 1 stars in this region yet have confirming o i @xmath103 spectroscopy .",
    "we have examined the spatial location of these four stars , however , and find that they are both in the spiral arms and near to other rank 1 yellow supergiants .",

    "we do _ not _ find yellow supergiants with luminosities of ( say ) @xmath117 , and this is in accord with what the evolutionary tracks predict .",
    "note that with the older tracks ( dotted tracks in figure  [ fig : models ] ) we might have expected to see some higher mass , warmer yellow supergiants .",
    "indeed , the number of high luminosity yellow supergiants should have been similar to that seen for lower luminosity 12 - 20@xmath1 yellow supergiants , as the older 60@xmath1 track extended into the yellow supergiant realm , and the duration of the yellow supergiant phase was 5,400 years ( comparable to that of the lower masses as seen in table  [ tab : ages ] ) .",
    "this agreement with the new tracks is similar to what massey et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found for the coolest supergiants ( @xmath118 k ) in terms of the excellent agreement between the location of the tracks ( and in particular the upper luminosities ) and the observed locations of the stars .",
    "m31 s rsgs have a maximum luminosity of @xmath119 , a little bit lower than the most luminous yellow supergiants , as might be expected from the evolutionary tracks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , as the 25@xmath1 track does not extend to such cool effective temperatures .",
    "we now tackle the test we described in   [ sec - magglass ] , namely to see whether the relative number of yellow supergiants increases as we go to higher luminosities as the lifetimes in table  [ tab : ages ] suggest to us .",
    "a visual inspection of figure  [ fig : hr ] says that the answer is clearly no : the number of yellow supergiants decrease .",
    "but , let us attempt a more quantitative assessment .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : numbers ] the number of yellow supergiants we find in each mass bin , both for the entire sample ( rank 1 and rank 2 ) and for just the ones we are most certain are actually supergiants ( rank 1 ) .",
    "we then normalize these to the number of stars in the lowest mass bin , 12 - 15@xmath1 .",
    "what we _ observe _ is a decreasing number of yellow supergiants as we go up in mass . at the bottom of table  [ tab : numbers ]",
    "we have included an  extra \" mass bin , 15 - 25@xmath1 , as it is clear from table  [ tab : ages ] that the evolutionary tracks predict a much longer lifetime for the 20@xmath1 model than for either the 15@xmath1 or the 25@xmath1 , and we wanted to see what the agreement would look like if we ignored this track .",
    "we can estimate the number of yellow supergiants we expect from the models if we assume  steady state \" star formation in m31 . by this , we require only that the star formation rate _ averaged over the entire disk _ has stayed about the same for the past 20 myr . in that case , the number of stars @xmath120 in a particular evolutionary phase within a mass bin extending from one mass ( @xmath121 ) to another ( @xmath122 ) will just be : @xmath123_{m_1}^{m_2 } \\times \\bar \\tau\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the slope of the initial mass function ( taken here to be @xmath125 following salpeter 1955 ; see also massey 1998b ) , and @xmath126 is the average duration of the evolutionary phase for masses @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in the final column of table  [",
    "tab : numbers ] we give the expected number according to the  s3 \" models .",
    "we have normalized the expected numbers relative to that of 12 - 15@xmath1 .    here",
    "we find relatively poor agreement . according to the models , the evolutionary time scale for the yellow supergiant phase increases significantly with mass ( table  [ tab : ages ] ) , more than compensating for the loss of stars due to the mass function .",
    "thus we expect to find @xmath127 more yellow supergiants between the 15 - 20@xmath1 tracks than between the 12 - 15@xmath1 , or @xmath128 more between the 20 - 25@xmath1 tracks than between the 12 - 15@xmath1 tracks .",
    "but , in reality , we find , 0.7 - 0.8@xmath13 and 0.2@xmath13 as many , respectively .",
    "( note that our results are insensitive to whether we count  all \" of our candidates or just the certain ones . )",
    "mostly this comes about because of the very long time predicted for the 20@xmath1 yellow supergiant stage relative to that of the lower masses ( 78,300 years vs 5,300 years ) .",
    "if we ignore the 20@xmath1 track we find only slightly better agreement , as the number of stars observed in the 15 - 25@xmath1 is about the same as in the 12 - 15@xmath1 track , while the models predict @xmath129 as many .",
    "in addition , the models predict 6@xmath13 as many 25 - 40@xmath1 yellow supergiants as those of 12 - 15@xmath1 . based on this",
    "we expect to find 110 - 150 yellow supergiants with masses of 25 - 40@xmath1 , but instead we observe _",
    "none_. we can tell from table  [ tab : numbers ] that the problem would be even worse if we had used the predictions of the  old \" @xmath8 tracks , as the lifetimes are even longer for stars with masses @xmath13025@xmath1 .",
    "we do note that the 40@xmath1 just barely enters the yellow supergiant realm .",
    "the long duration of this time stage reflects the fact that the star takes some time to turn around there .",
    "we also recall that in our sample we included stars that had bluer colors than our definition of yellow supergiants .",
    "so , if there were an abundance of such stars we would expect to have observed them , and , yet , none show up in the hrd .",
    "nevertheless , if we were to assume that the duration of the 40@xmath1 yellow supergiant phase was 0 years , rather than the 50,800 years we ve included , then the number of expected stars between 25 and 40@xmath1 would be 1.5@xmath13 that of the 12 - 15@xmath1 yellow supergiants .",
    "thus rather than the 110 - 150 between the 25 and 40@xmath1 we expect by using the 40@xmath1 lifetime , we would only expect 30 - 60 stars between 25 and 40@xmath1 .",
    "however , this still results in a significant discrepancy with observations , as we observe _ no _ yellow supergiants in this mass range .",
    "we emphasize that even though we expect some minimal contamination of our sample by foreground objects , the _ maximum _ contamination for the rank 1 objects (  mostly certain \" ) is 15% .",
    "however , we obtain essentially the same ratios in table  [ tab : numbers ] whether we count all of our candidates ( rank 1 and rank 2 ) or just the rank 1 stars .",
    "so , it appears that our conclusion is robust .",
    "recall also from figure  [ fig : magcomp ] that if anything our radial velocity survey was slightly biased towards the brighter stars than the fainter .",
    "we have made no allowance for this in the observed ratios in table  [ tab : numbers ] , but to do so would _ increase _ the discrepancy .",
    "the typical 12 - 15@xmath1 stars have @xmath131 , or @xmath132 , while the 20 - 25@xmath1 stars have @xmath133 , or @xmath134 . the lower mass stars",
    "are therefore under represented by perhaps a factor of @xmath135 .",
    "thus the 0.2 nominal observed ratio of the 20 - 25@xmath1 stars relative to the 12 - 15@xmath1 stars should actually be lower by a factor of 1.5 , suggesting that the disagreement with the 5.6 ratio predicted by the models is about a factor of 40 .",
    "is this a problem with the higher mass evolutionary tracks predicting too long a time scale for the yellow supergiant stage , or with the lower mass tracks predicting too short a time scale ?",
    "we can answer this indirectly by computing their expected lifetimes based upon the relative number of yellow supergiants and unevolved ( o - type ) stars observed . using the lggs data , massey ( 2009 )",
    "estimates the number of unevolved massive stars with masses @xmath4 is about 24,800 in m31 .",
    "the imf - weighted h - burning lifetime is of order 5  myr , and , assuming a constant star formation rate , we would thus expect to see @xmath136 massive stars born each year .",
    "we observe 8 total ( certain and probable ) yellow supergiants above 20@xmath1 .",
    "recall that our sample contains only 68% of the stars located in the region for which we expect radial velocities to be @xmath137 km s@xmath11 , and that region covered 73% of the area of the entire lggs , from which the number of unevolved massive stars were estimated .",
    "we expect then that the true number of yellow supergiants with masses@xmath138 is about 16 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the actual ages of the yellow supergiant stage as 16/24800 @xmath13 5 myr .",
    "this is about 3200 years , which is consistent with the life times the 12 - 15@xmath1 models predict , but is at variance with the much longer time scales predicted by the models for higher mass yellow supergiants .",
    "we suggest that these are too long by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "could this discrepancy instead be an argument that the global star formation rate in m31 has in fact not been constant over the past 20  myr ?",
    "yellow supergiants of 12@xmath1 are roughly 17  myr old , according to the models , while those of 25@xmath1 are only 7  myr .",
    "so , if during that 10  myr period the overall star formation rate had decreased by a factor of 30 - 40 that would roughly compensate for the smaller number of stars that we find . however , such a drastic change is in conflict with other observations . williams ( 2003 ) analyzed lggs photometry and concluded that there has been a slight ( 25% ) increase in the star formatation rate since 25  myr ago .",
    "this is a marginal result , and consistent with constant star formation to within 2@xmath64 ( see his table 2 ) , but it certainly precludes the possibility of a 3000% - 4000% decrease over a similar time span .",
    "we measured radial velocities for @xmath21 stars in m31 , identifying 54 as rank 1 ( nearly certain supergiants ) and 66 as rank 2 ( probable supergiants ) .",
    "follow up spectroscopy eliminated 4 of the rank 2 stars , while confirming others as supergiants .",
    "the magnitude limits we chose should make our sample complete down to 12@xmath1 . in all we observed 68% of the target candidates and",
    "the sample was restricted to the 73% of the lggs area that should have radial velocities @xmath137 km s@xmath11 .",
    "so , the true number of yellow supergiants should be about a factor of 2.0 larger than what we find .",
    "the foreground contamination proved to be 96 - 98% .",
    "there may be a few halo yellow giants among our candidates , but comparison with the besancon model suggests this should be minor , at most 15% for the rank 1 objects based purely upon the distribution of radial velocities . in practice",
    "we expect this contamination to be considerably less , since we replied upon the difference between the observed and expected velocities ( where the latter is dependent upon position in the galaxy ) to assign rank and membership .",
    "nevertheless , it would be very useful to conduct follow up spectroscopy of the rank 2 objects in order to ascertain which have strong o i @xmath103 absorption or other spectral indicators of high luminosity .",
    "we compared the location and numbers of yellow supergiants in the h - r diagram to those expected from the geneva evolutionary tracks .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the locations of stars in the h - r diagram and the tracks : there are not ( for instance ) high luminosity yellow supergiants with moderate temperatures that are inconsistent with the tracks .",
    "rather , the inconsistencies we do note are related to the lifetimes predicted by the models for the yellow supergiant stage .",
    "the number of yellow supergiants decrease with increasing luminosity ( mass ) , with no stars found more massive 25@xmath1 . yet",
    ", the long duration of the yellow supergiant phase predicted by the models for 20 - 40@xmath1 suggests that we should see far more high luminosity yellow supergiants than what we observe . comparing the number of yellow supergiants we find to the number of unevolved o - type stars , suggests that the typical duration of the yellow supergiant stage for stars with masses @xmath4 should be 3000 years , similar to what the models predict for 12 - 15@xmath1 yet , the models predict lifetimes far greater than this .",
    "we do not yet have an adequate explanation for the discrepancy , but will address this in future work . the higher mass tracks ( for which the predicted yellow supergiant lifetimes appear to be too long )",
    "show the stars evolving back to the blue after the rsg stage .",
    "if instead the stars ended their lives as rsgs , without this loop back to the blue , then the predicted yellow supergiant phase would be shorter as the star would pass through this region only once",
    ". this might be the case if the mass loss during the rsg stage had been significantly over - estimated . in part , this could be tested by comparing the number of observed wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) with that of rsgs .",
    "the number of wrs in m31 is not known well enough to make this comparison as yet .",
    "alternatively , it could be that the blue loops are present , but that the mass - loss rates during the evolution blue - wards have been underestimated",
    ". a sensitive test would be to conduct abundance studies of the yellow supergiants in this region of the hrd to look for evidence that any of these stars are in a post - rsg phase .",
    "an additional test would be to look for circumstellar material left from the slow dense wind of the rsg stage around any of these objects",
    ".    it would , of course , be of interest to extend this work to galaxies with other metallicities , such as the magellanic clouds , where the unevolved massive star content is also known , and where the models predict long lifetimes for yellow supergiants even for 12 - 15@xmath1 stars ( table  [ tab : ages ] ) .",
    "we hope to carry out such work ourselves during the next observing season .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the fine support at the mmt observatory .",

    "<S> the yellow supergiant content of nearby galaxies can provide a critical test of stellar evolution theory , bridging the gap between the hot , massive stars and the cool red supergiants . </S>",
    "<S> but , this region of the color - magnitude diagram is dominated by foreground contamination , requiring membership to somehow be determined . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the large negative systemic velocity of m31 , coupled to its high rotation rate , provides the means for separating the contaminating foreground dwarfs from the _ bona fide _ yellow supergiants within m31 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained radial velocities of @xmath02900 individual targets within the correct color - magnitude range corresponding to masses of 12@xmath1 and higher . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of these velocities to those expected from m31 s rotation curve reveals 54 rank 1 ( near certain ) and 66 rank 2 ( probable ) yellow supergiant members , indicating a foreground contamination @xmath2 96% . </S>",
    "<S> we expect some modest contamination from milky way halo giants among the remainder , particularly for the rank 2 candidates , and indeed follow - up spectroscopy of a small sample eliminates 4 rank 2 s while confirming 5 others . </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement between the location of yellow supergiants in the h - r diagram and that predicted by the latest geneva evolutionary tracks which include rotation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relative number of yellow supergiants seen as a function of mass varies from that predicted by the models by a factor of @xmath310 , in the sense that more high mass yellow supergiants are predicted than are actually observed . comparing the total number ( 16 ) of @xmath4 yellow supergiants with the estimated number ( 24,800 ) of unevolved o stars </S>",
    "<S> indicates that the duration of the yellow supergiant phase is @xmath03000 years . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with what the 12@xmath1 and 15@xmath1 evolutionary tracks predict , but disagrees with the 20,000 - 80,000 year time scales predicted by the models for higher masses . </S>"
