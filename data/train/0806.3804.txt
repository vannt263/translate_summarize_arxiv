    "the production of one unpolarized hadron in polarized lepton - nucleon dis can be described using eighteen structure functions  @xcite .",
    "eight of them are describing azimuthal asymmetries proportional to target transverse polarization . within factorized qcd parton model",
    ", these structure functions can be expressed as convolutions of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) quark distribution and fragmentation functions ( dfs and ffs ) . to evaluate these structure functions only six t - even twist - two dfs and two twist - two ffs together with @xmath0 kinematic corrections",
    "were taken into account in  @xcite .",
    "the full expressions for the structure functions in terms of convolutions of twist - two and twist - three dfs and ffs are given in  @xcite .",
    "since the tmd dfs and ffs are nonperturbative objects and can not be calculated from first principles , the standard way to study them is to use some parameterizations and then , using expressions for the cross - sections and asymmetries , fit the parameters to existing data  @xcite . other approach",
    " develop nonperturbative models for nucleon structure and quark fragmentation , see for example  @xcite .    here",
    "i ll discuss some properties of dfs calculated in a simple quark - diquark model  @xcite and present the comparison of results for target transverse spin azimuthal asymmetries with compass preliminary data  @xcite .",
    "we use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite with a modified formfactor for the proton - quark - diquark vertex .",
    "namely , instead of power - like dependence on quark virtuality , we use the gaussian dependence : @xmath1 with this choice of formfactor the six leading order ( lo ) t - even dfs for the scalar ( @xmath2 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath3 ) diquark look like @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the dfs for _ u _ ( _ d _ ) quarks in the proton are given by @xmath8 and similarly for other dfs .",
    "since the model is describing only the valence quarks , the normalization factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are obtained by requiring that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are normalized to unity upon integration over @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in expressions (  [ ff][udfs ] ) , @xmath15 is the proton mass and @xmath16 gev / c , @xmath17 gev / c , @xmath18 gev / c and @xmath19 gev / c are free parameters of the model suggested in  @xcite .",
    "let us stress here that since the model is based on tree diagrams , the t - odd sivers , @xmath20 , and boer - mulders , @xmath21 , functions are equal to zero .",
    "in many phenomenological applications for tmd dfs the @xmath13-@xmath22 factorized form : @xmath23 , @xmath24 with _ x_-independent width of transverse momentum distribution @xmath25 is used . with this choice the quark longitudinal polarization ,",
    "@xmath26 , also has a @xmath13-@xmath22 factorized form .",
    "thus , for different fixed transverse momenta , the quark polarization has similar ( re - scaled depending on these transverse momenta factors ) x - dependence .",
    "in contrast , with our choice of quark - diquark model , not only does the x - dependence of @xmath27 changes its form for different fixed @xmath22 but it changes sign as well , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this behavior is tightly related to different quark orbital momentum contributions to dfs with scalar and vector diquark . indeed , from eqs .",
    "( [ 6dfs ] ) the positive and negative helicity dfs @xmath28 look as @xmath29 the df @xmath30 has the relative angular momentum @xmath31 and for @xmath32 we have @xmath33 . for the axial - vector diquark case @xmath31 and @xmath34",
    "orbital momenta contribute both in @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( for more discussion , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13-@xmath22 factorization assumption was used in some analyzes of high-@xmath37 hadron production asymmetries where scattering on quark is considered as a background process in polarized gluon distribution extraction .",
    "it is clear that the effective range of intrinsic @xmath22 depends on the lower cut in hadron @xmath37 and one can conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that the magnitude of this background contribution can be different depending on the choice of @xmath22-dependence of tmd dfs .",
    "this consideration demonstrates that it is very important to obtain a reliable information on unpolarized and helicity tmd dfs by precise measurement of @xmath13- , @xmath38- , @xmath37- and azimuthal dependences of unpolarized sidis cross section and @xmath39 asymmetry and perform a flavor analysis ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "let us start by asymmetries which are described in the parton model by convolutions of twist - two dfs and ffs .",
    "the sivers function is equal to zero in quark - diquark model , thus @xmath40 .",
    "the collins asymmetry can be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes integration over intrinsic transverse momentum of quark and hadron @xmath43- and @xmath44-variables over the kinematic domain of experiment .",
    "for details see refs .",
    "the results of calculations for charged hadron production asymmetry on deuteron  @xcite and proton  @xcite target are presented in left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : collins ] . for unpolarized ffs",
    ", we are using the recent dss lo set  @xcite and for collins ffs the parametrization from the recent global analysis  @xcite .",
    "the df @xmath45 gives origin to double spin asymmetry @xmath46 and the df @xmath47  to @xmath48 the results are presented in left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .    other four target transverse",
    "spin dependent asymmetries can be treated as kinematic @xmath0 corrections to twist - two contributions  @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath49 @xmath50",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52    the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and  [ fig : fig5 ] .    note that , because the simple quark - diquark model is developed for valence quarks , the calculations are presented for not too small values of bjorken variable _",
    "x_. calculations of @xmath38- and @xmath37-dependences of asymmetries for compass kinematics include @xmath13-integration starting from very small @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the main contribution to unpolarized cross - section @xmath38- and @xmath37-dependence comes from sea quark region .",
    "for this reason , the quark - diquark model is not well adapted to describe these dependences of asymmetries at compass kinematics .",
    "the mechanism of final state interaction ( fsi ) for generating the sivers asymmetry in sidis was proposed in ref .",
    "application of this mechanism to quark - diquark model was considered in  @xcite and  @xcite . with sivers dfs calculated within this approach",
    ", one can rather well describe the @xmath13-dependences of pion asymmetries observed by hermes and compass .",
    "however , we have observed that these functions are violating the naive positivity constraint for sivers analyzing power : @xmath54    namely , with dipole - like formfactor in the proton - quark - diquark vertex in models  @xcite one obtains for high-@xmath22 @xmath55 , with gaussian choice eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) @xmath56 and even stronger divergence in approach of  @xcite .",
    "the similar positivity violation for polarizing power , @xmath57 , holds for the boer - mulders function calculated in  @xcite  @xmath58 at high @xmath22 .",
    "the quark - diquark model provides a good tool to study nonperturbative spin dynamics .",
    "the predictions of target transverse spin dependent asymmetries obtained using this model are in good agreement with compass measurement  @xcite .",
    "the interesting property of this model is the violation of the @xmath13-@xmath22 factorization and dependence on @xmath13 of width of transverse momentum distribution .",
    "it is be very important to measure the sidis cross - sections and asymmetries with high precision and perform a global analysis of data to get reliable two - dimensional parameterizations of different tmd dfs .",
    "sivers and boer - mulders functions obtained by applying the fsi mechanism to quark - diquark model do not satisfy the positivity bounds .",
    "therefore , the questions arise : is the fsi mechanism  @xcite a universal explanation for nonzero sivers function ? is it possible to avoid the violation of positivity by adding a formfactor in the gluon - diquark vertex or by a re - summation of higher order diagrams ?",
    "more studies are needed to answer these questions .",
