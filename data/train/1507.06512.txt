    "stars during their early stage of evolution experience a phase of mass loss driven by strong stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the stellar winds can entrain and accelerate ambient gas and inject momentum and energy into the surrounding environment , thereby significantly affect the dynamics and structure of their parent molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "both outflows and bubbles are manifestations of strong stellar winds dispersing the surrounding gas . in general , collimated jet - like winds from young embedded protostars usually drive powerful collimated outflows , while wide - angle or spherical winds from the pre - main - sequence stars are more likely to drive less - collimated outflows or bubbles @xcite .",
    "a bubble is a partially or fully enclosed three - dimensional structure whose projection is a partial or full ring @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of an outflow is very large ( @xmath10-@xmath11 erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying a substantial input of mechanical energy into its parent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "feedback from young stars has been proposed as a significant aspect of self - regulation of star formation @xcite .",
    "feedback may maintain the observed turbulence in molecular clouds and it may also be responsible for stabilizing the clouds against gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the impact of outflows on surrounding gas has been studied primarily in small regions such as orion kl @xcite , l1551 @xcite and gl 490 @xcite on scales less than 10@xmath12 .",
    "recently there have been a few studies related to outflow feedback in nearby clouds .",
    "@xcite undertook a complete survey of outflows in perseus and found that outflows have an important impact on the environment immediately surrounding localized regions of active star formation , but that outflows have insufficient energy to feed the observed turbulence in the entire perseus complex . @xcite and @xcite studied the outflows in the @xmath13 ophiuchi main cloud and serpens south , respectively .",
    "both studies concluded that outflows can power the supersonic turbulence in their parent molecular cloud but do not have enough momentum to support the entire cloud against the global gravitational contraction .",
    "@xcite identified 20 outflows in the taurus region and concluded that outflows can not sustain the observed turbulence seen in the entire cloud . in this paper , we report a systematic and detailed search for outflows around sources from the spitzer space telescope ( hereinafter referred to as spitzer ) young stellar object ( yso ) catalog and then estimated their impact on the entire taurus molecular cloud .",
    "similar to outflows , bubbles are important morphological features in star formation process , which can give information about spherical stellar winds and physical properties of their surrounding environments @xcite .",
    "parsec - scale bubbles are usually found in massive star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the conventional thought has been that high - mass stars can drive spherical winds and easily create the observed bubbles , while the spherical winds from low- and intermediate - mass stars are too weak to produce bubbles . however , @xcite studied shells ( bubbles ) in perseus , a nearby low - mass star - forming molecular cloud , and concluded that the total energy input from outflows and shells is sufficient to maintain the turbulence .",

    "recently , 20 outflows have been identified , 8 of which were new detections with the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) @xmath2co j=1 - 0 and @xmath3co j=1 - 0 data cubes covering the entire taurus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the up - to - date catalog of ysos @xcite from the spitzer provides an opportunity to search for outflows and bubbles in a more comprehensive manner . here",
    "we present a systematic and detailed search for outflows and bubbles in the vicinity of young stellar objects and estimate their impact on the overall taurus molecular cloud .",

    "we describe the data used in the study .",
    "the details including searching methods , morphology and physical parameters of outflows and bubbles are presented in   [ outflows ] and   [ bubbles ] , respectively .",
    "the driving sources of outflows and bubbles , their energy feedback to the parent cloud and the related comparison between taurus and perseus are discussed   [ discussion ] . in   [ conclusions ] we summarize the main results .",
    "in our study we used the @xmath2co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath3co(1 - 0 ) data observed with 13.7 m fcrao telescope @xcite .",
    "we also adopted the up - to - date catalog of spitzer ysos , where 215 ysos and 140 new yso candidates in taurus are reported @xcite .",
    "the fcrao co survey was taken between 2003 and 2005 .",
    "the @xmath2co and @xmath3co maps are centered at @xmath14=@xmath15 , @xmath16=@xmath17 ( j2000 ) covering an area of approximately 100 @xmath18 .",

    "the mips ( multi - band imaging photometer for spitzer ; * ? ? ?",

    "the maps were created using the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) and coadded using the spitzer software package mopex ( mosaicking and point source extractor ; * ? ? ? * ) . despite the fact that the data were taken with interleaved scan legs to provide optimal coverage at 70 and 160 @xmath24 m",
    ", some small gaps remained , in particular at 160 @xmath24 m .",
    "to mitigate this effect , the 160 @xmath24 m final mosaic was created using 32 arcsec  pixels , instead of the native 16 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "this pixel scale matches quite well with the @xmath2540 arcsec beam at 160 @xmath24 m wavelength .",
    "the 24 and 70 @xmath24 m maps adopted the standand 2.5 and 4 arcsec / pixel scale , respectively , to properly sample their respective 6 and 18 arcsec  beams .",
    "the maps were used successfully for photometric purposes to identify new sources in the taurus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we identified 55 outflows around the spitzer ysos in the 44 deg@xmath1 area of taurus . in total 31 of the detected outflows were previously unknown . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the searching procedure of outflows , the morphology , physical properties , and the comparison between our findings and the known ones .      instead of a blind search , we focused on seeking outflows around ysos .",
    "the search procedure was performed with an interactive data language ( idl ) pipeline .",
    "we plotted spectra , position velocity diagrams ( hereafter p - v diagrams ) and integrated intensity maps to identify the outflows around the 355 ysos which spitzer identified in taurus .",
    "detailed steps of the search are the following .",
    "\\(1 ) we plotted @xmath2co contours ( hereafter contour map ) overlaid on a @xmath3co grey - scale image around a yso . according to the scale and velocity range of previously - detected outflows in taurus , we chose two sizes ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and three sets of velocity intervals ( -1 to 3.5 km s@xmath8 , -1 to 4.5 km s@xmath8 and -1 to 5.5 km s@xmath8 for blue ; 7.5 to 13 km s@xmath8 , 8.5 to 13 km s@xmath8 and 9.5 to 13 km s@xmath8 for red ) to plot the contour maps .",
    "we plotted the maps with 3 sets of velocity intervals and two scales around the 355 ysos automatically . in total , 2130 maps were obtained .",
    "we inspected these maps to identify outflow candidates according to the morphology of the blue and red lobes . in the end",
    ", 74 candidates were selected .",
    "\\(2 ) we plotted @xmath2co p - v diagrams along four directions ( at position angles of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) on three scales ( 20@xmath12 , 40@xmath12 and 60@xmath12 ) around the 74 candidates .",
    "the size and high - velocity range of outflow candidates were determined roughly by checking the p - v diagrams .",
    "when the velocity bulge appears along the direction away from the central velocity , we marked it as the start of the high - velocity wing . and along the above direction , the maximum velocity corresponding to the outermost contour is the end of this high - velocity wing .",
    "we further confirmed each of the diagrams individually by visual inspection .",
    "the position range of the entire high - velocity bulge along the position axis was considered to be the rough size of the outflow .",
    "if more than one central velocity is found in the p - v diagram , it likely has multiple velocity components @xcite and thus will be excluded from the list of outflow candidates .",
    "therefore , 19 candidates with multiple velocity components were eliminated and the remaining 55 outflow candidates were considered to be possible outflows .",
    "\\(3 ) using the rough sizes and velocity ranges obtained in step ( 2 ) , we plotted contour maps for the remaining 55 outflows .",
    "p - v diagrams were plotted through the midpoint of the blue and red peaks ( bipolar outflow ) or through the peak of the lobe in the case of monopolar outflow , at position angles spaced by @xmath32 .",
    "we chose the angle with the most prominent bulge along the velocity axis to determine the velocity interval of the outflows .",
    "then we plotted the contour map again with this velocity interval .",
    "\\(4 ) finally we plotted the average spectra of the blue and red lobes . according to the morphology of p - v diagrams and contour maps , we divided the outflows into five classes .",
    "the higher is the ranking , the more likely it is that we have identified an outflow .",
    "we define a typical p - v diagram ( tpv ) and a representative contour map ( rcm ) as follows .",
    "if there is obvious high velocity gas which can be seen by the protuberance along the velocity axis on the p - v diagram and the high velocity range is not less than 1 km s@xmath8 , then we regard the p - v diagram as a tpv .",
    "if the outermost contour of the lobe is closed and we can see a clear and unbroken lobe on the contour map , then we regard the contour map as a rcm .",
    "table [ outflowclass ] shows our criteria for outflow classification with an `` @xmath33 '' meaning that it satisfies a certain condition . having both @xmath2co tpv and @xmath2co rcm",
    "is required for high ranking ( class a@xmath34 ) , but having @xmath3co tpv or @xmath3co rcm gives a lower ranking ( class a@xmath35 and class b@xmath35 ) because @xmath3co is generally optically thin in outflows and we usually found lobes of outflows with @xmath2co not @xmath3co .",
    "having only @xmath2co rcm was divided into the lowest ranking ( class c@xmath34 ) because the high velocity gas in p - v diagram is not obvious .",
    "the primary condition to identify an outflow is having high velocity gas which can be seen from the protuberance along the velocity axis on the p - v diagram .",
