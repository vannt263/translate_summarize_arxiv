    "many papers have been written on @xmath1-symmetric quantum - mechanical hamiltonians . in nearly all cases these hamiltonians",
    "have had rising potentials and energies that are all discrete and _ real_. an example of such a class of hamiltonians is @xcite @xmath2 in a few instances quantum - mechanical hamiltonians having real continuous spectra have been examined @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath1-symmetric quantum - mechanical hamiltonians having discrete spectra , the associated classical - mechanical systems have also been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the classical trajectories associated with real energies are @xmath1-symmetric ( they are symmetric under reflection about the imaginary axis ) and exhibit remarkably interesting topological properties .",
    "these trajectories can visit multiple sheets of a riemann surface .",
    "however , the classical mechanics associated with quantum systems having continuous spectra have not yet been examined .",
    "thus , in this paper we explore the classical trajectories of the periodic potential analyzed in ref .",

    "consider a classical - mechanical system consisting of a simple pendulum with a bob of mass @xmath3 and a string of length @xmath4 in a uniform gravitational field of magnitude @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of the system is defined to be zero at the height of the pivot point of the string .",
    "the pendulum bob swings through an angle @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the horizontal and vertical cartesian coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 which gives velocities @xmath9 we define the potential and kinetic energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 the hamiltonian @xmath13 for the pendulum is therefore @xmath14 without loss of generality we set @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and for consistency with the notation used in earlier papers on @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians we relabel @xmath17 to get @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the classical equations of motion for this hamiltonian read @xmath20 the hamiltonian @xmath21 for this system is a constant of the motion and thus the energy @xmath22 is a time - independent quantity . for most of this paper",
    "we take @xmath22 to be real because the energy levels of the corresponding quantum - mechanical system are real .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we study the complex trajectories for @xmath21 in ( [ e6 ] ) when @xmath22 and @xmath0 are real . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we study the complex trajectories for @xmath21 when @xmath22 is real but @xmath0 is imaginary . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we examine briefly the complex chaotic motion that results when the energy @xmath22 of the pendulum is allowed to be complex and also when the pendulum is subject to a periodic external driving force .",
    "in this section we examine the solutions to hamilton s equations ( [ e7 ] ) for the case in which the gravitational field strength @xmath0 is real . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath23 .",
    "there are three cases to consider : ( 1 ) the complex closed trajectories that result when @xmath24 , ( 2 ) the complex open trajectories that occur when @xmath25 , and ( 3 ) the complex closed trajectories that we obtain when @xmath26 .",
    "when the energy @xmath22 of a simple pendulum lies in the range @xmath27 , the physically observed motion is that of a swinging pendulum . for the example considered in this subsection",
    "we choose @xmath28 .",
    "since a _ classical turning point _",
    "@xmath29 is the solution to the equation @xmath30 , the classical turning points for this case satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 the observed classical trajectory for this pendulum is represented by @xmath33 on the real-@xmath34 axis .",
    "this trajectory oscillates on the real axis between the turning points at @xmath35 .",
    "however , the full array of complex solutions to the classical equations of motion is much richer ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . in this figure",
    "we see that all classical trajectories are closed and periodic and lie in cells of width @xmath36 that fill the entire complex-@xmath34 plane . as a consequence of cauchy s theorem ,",
    "all of the closed orbits have exactly the same period ; namely , the period of a real physical pendulum that undergoes periodic motion on the real axis .",
    "this is because the period @xmath11 for a particle of energy @xmath22 for a hamiltonian of the form @xmath37 is given in terms of a closed complex contour integral : @xmath38}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the complex closed path of the particle . since the only singularity that @xmath39 encloses is the square - root branch cut joining the turning points , the value of @xmath11 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "note that the orbits in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that lie near the turning points are approximately elliptical and resemble the exactly elliptic complex trajectories of the simple harmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is @xmath40 .",
    "these orbits are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "when the energy @xmath22 of a simple pendulum is sufficiently large ( here , @xmath25 ) , the physically observed motion is that of a rotating pendulum .",
    "the classical turning points for this case are no longer on the real axis because there are no real solutions to @xmath41 with @xmath25 .",
    "the rotating pendulum has no real turning points because its real trajectory never turns back . to find the complex turning points , we replace @xmath29 by @xmath42 and get two equations : @xmath43 for the example considered in this subsection we choose @xmath44 , and",
    "thus the turning points are situated at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the complex trajectories for this case are shown in fig .",
    "note that the trajectories fill the entire complex plane and that there are no closed orbits .",
    "the turning points have a strong influence on the path of the complex pendulum bob .",
    "the trajectories in the upper - half complex-@xmath34 plane , for example , go just below and veer around the turning points above the real axis .",
    "the turning points seem to attract the trajectories in much the same way as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the trajectories that terminate at turning points run vertically off to complex infinity .",
    "this feature is also a property of the hamiltonian @xmath48 , which was studied in detail in ref .",
    "the complex trajectories for this hamiltonian are shown in fig .",
    "there are three turning points , and the trajectory beginning at the turning point on the imaginary axis goes up the imaginary axis to infinity .",
    "one may ask how long it takes for a particle beginning at a turning point , say , the turning point at @xmath49 , to reach infinity .",
    "the time @xmath11 for this motion is represented by the following integral : @xmath50 a numerical evaluation of this integral gives @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the particle reaches the point at complex infinity in a finite time .",
    "there are no physically observable trajectories for this choice of the energy .",
    "however , the complex trajectories in this case can be calculated numerically ( see fig .  [ f6 ] ) and",
    "we find that they are all closed orbits that lie in periodic cells of width @xmath36 .",
    "the turning points come in complex - conjugate pairs . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] we have chosen @xmath52 and the turning points are situated at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 .",
    "if we take the gravitational field strength @xmath0 in ( [ e6 ] ) to be imaginary , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath1 symmetric , where @xmath55 reflection consists of @xmath56 .",
    "setting @xmath57 , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath58 and the turning points are located at @xmath53 , where @xmath59    there are now two cases to consider , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we take @xmath62 and find turning points at @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we take @xmath65 and find turning points at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . like the complex trajectories in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , the trajectories in these two figures are not closed and trajectories beginning at turning points run vertically off to infinity . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] one such trajectory is shown .",
    "this trajectory begins at @xmath68 .",
    "the time @xmath11 for a particle to travel from this turning point to infinity is given by @xmath69 after a simple change of variables this integral becomes @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the complete elliptic function .",
    "thus , the classical particle reaches complex infinity in finite time .",
    "there are a number of interesting ways to extend and generalize the investigations in the previous two sections .    in figs .",
    "[ f7 ] and [ f8 ] the energy for the pendulum in an imaginary gravitational field was taken to be real .",
    "this is because a quantum - mechanical @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian has the virtue of possessing real energy levels .",
    "however , one might ask what happens if one takes the energy to be complex . in this case",
    "the complex trajectories are not spatially or temporally periodic , even though the turning points _ are _ periodic and are separated horizontally by @xmath36 . the behavior of the trajectories is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , where we have taken the energy to be @xmath72 .",
    "another way to extend these investigations is to study what happens when there is an external periodic driving force of the form @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we have taken @xmath74 and @xmath75 and in figs .",
    "[ f10 ] , [ f11 ] , and [ f12 ] we have examined the complex trajectories up to times @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . the starting energy for these figures",
    "is taken to be @xmath79 and the value of @xmath0 is @xmath80 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath34 is taken to be @xmath81,which would lead to a complex trajectory if there were no driving term .",
    "we see that for short times the trajectory is noisy , but seems to be confined to the central cell in fig .",
    "however , after a sufficiently long time the trajectory wanders into adjacent cells , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ f11 ] and [ f12 ] .",
    "this result suggests it might be productive to investigate complex trajectories of dynamical systems whose real trajectories exhibit chaos , especially in the @xmath1-symmetric case .",
    "one could begin with the complex trajectories associated with real homoclinic chaos , as in the present case .",
    "in addition , the rich behavior seen in the complex spatial trajectories of @xmath1-symmetric systems may be expected to be the projection onto the two - dimensional complex plane of interesting behavior in four - dimensional complex phase space .",
    "for example , the phase - space trajectories of @xmath1-symmetric complex systems whose real parts are chaotic might exhibit a complex hamiltonian analog of arnold diffusion , or some other kind of hamiltonian diffusion .",
