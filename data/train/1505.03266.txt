    "the quantum superposition principle and the wave function collapse set apart the quantum description of the world from its classical counterpart .",
    "as a consequence , in the standard paradigm , the outcome of a single measurement can not be predicted with certainty and we can only assign probabilities to different outcomes .",
    "since the measurement process disturbs the system and in a projective measurement the state of the system collapses we can not re - use the state for any further measurement .",
    "this necessitates the use of an ensemble of identically prepared states in order to interpret quantum measurements .",
    "ideally , in the large ensemble limit the ensemble average tends to the expectation value of the observable .",
    "the question that arises at this point is : what if we are provided with a small ensemble of states and asked to make the best use of it ?",
    "projective measurements require a large coupling between the system and the measuring device .",
    "however , if the coupling is made small , we inflict a very small disturbance to the system at the expense of extracting a correspondingly small amount of information  @xcite .",
    "such measurements are known as weak or unsharp measurements .",
    "such measurements have been introduced in various forms in the past  @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength can be tuned to suit the situation and the state can subjected to further measurements to extract more information .",
    "whenever we have a small ensemble , each member can be `` weakly '' measured more than once with a possibility of extracting more information .",
    "it is that true that all quantum measurements ( projective , non - projective , weak etc ) can be seen as positive operator valued measures ( povm ) .",
    "still it is important to know the details and workings of a measurement scheme .",
    "a povm can also be interpreted as a projective measurement on a larger hilbert space  @xcite . for a finite ensemble the upper bound on the amount of information extractable is available  @xcite .",
    "there is always a cost of information extraction from quantum systems in terms of the disturbance caused and that too has has also been explored for the case of weak measurements  @xcite .    a recent work by rozema et .",
    "al . suggests some new possibilities that weak measurements can offer with respect to heisenberg s uncertainty relation and the disturbance caused to the state  @xcite .",
    "oreshkov et .",
    "al . , in 2005 , wrote down a weak measurement povm and showed that any generalized measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements , without using an ancilla  @xcite .",
    "lundeen et .",
    "al . recently came up with a method employing weak values to directly measure the wave function of a quantum system in a pure state  @xcite and followed it up with a method to measure any general state  @xcite .",
    "for some further developments in this regard see  @xcite .",
    "unsharp measurements have also been used to make sequential measurements on a single qubit  @xcite .",
    "other examples of quantum state tomography with weak measurements can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an approach to perform quantum state tomography using weak measurement povms was introduced by hofmann  @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper some of our results on state estimation by `` weak '' measurements .",
    "we explore the case of a single qubit and show by explicit simulations how under certain circumstances the weak measurement based state estimation scheme can beat the one based on projective measurements .",
    "the measuring apparatus plays a crucial role in quantum measurements ; on the one hand it interacts with the quantum system and on the other hand it has classical properties where the outcomes can be read out and recorded . a useful model of this process is available due to von neumann .",
    "although originally this model was constructed for strong ( projective ) measurements  @xcite it has wider applications and can also be applied to weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "consider the measurement of an observable @xmath0 of a quantum system with eigenvectors @xmath1 and eigenvalues @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "imagine an apparatus with continuous pointer positions described by a variable @xmath4 and its conjugate variable @xmath5 such that @xmath6=i$ ] .",
    "the initial state of the measuring device has an initial spread of @xmath7 with its gaussian quantum state @xmath8 centered around zero given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and we have taken @xmath11 . the system and the measuring device are made to interact by means of a hamiltonian , @xmath12 where @xmath5 is the momentum conjugate to the variable @xmath4 , and @xmath13 is the coupling strength . the hamiltonian is so chosen that the system and the device get a kick and interact momentarily at @xmath14 .",
    "let the initial state @xmath15 of the system be written in terms of the eigenstates @xmath16 of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath17 the joint evolution of the system and the measuring device under the coupling hamiltonian gives an entangled state for @xmath18 @xmath19 the above state consists of a series of gaussians centered at @xmath20 for the pointer entangled with corresponding eigenstates @xmath21 of the system . at this stage",
    "we invoke the fact that the apparatus is classical , because of the fact that only one of the pointer positions actually shows up .",
    "this requires the collapse of the wave function which is brought in as something from outside for the classical apparatus ! thus the process",
    "is completed with the meter showing only one of the @xmath22s and the system state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate @xmath23 .",
    "the above analysis holds good only if the gaussians are well separated or distinct .",
    "in contrast , when the gaussians overlap , which can happen if the coupling strength @xmath13 is small or the initial spread in the pointer state given by @xmath24 is large , the scenario changes  @xcite .",
    "this is called the weak or unsharp measurement regime .",
    "weak measurements have been employed in developing recipes for the violation of bell inequalities  @xcite and leggett - garg inequalities  @xcite .",
    "these have also been recently used to study super - quantum discord  @xcite .      in the treatment of weak measurement given by aharonov , albert and vaidmann ( aav ) , first a subsequent projective measurement of a second observable @xmath25",
    "is carried out , followed by a post - selection of the output state into one of the eigenstates of the second observable , say @xmath26 .",
    "the weak value of the observable @xmath0 , which was measured in the weak regime , is then defined as @xmath27 when the post - selected state @xmath28 is nearly orthogonal to the initial state @xmath15 equation [  [ weakvalue ] ] tells us that the weak value becomes very large , so large that it can lie outside the allowed range of the eigenvalue spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of weak values is a current topic of research in quantum information theory .",
    "weak values can be complex and the real and the complex parts can be interpreted in terms of the displacements in the position and momentum spaces , respectively , of the measuring device  @xcite .",
    "weak values have been used to reinterpret the flow of time in quantum mechanics  @xcite and in the direct measurement of the photon wavefunction  @xcite and in the amplification of small signals  @xcite .",
    "another interesting application of weak values is in connection with quantum chesire cat experiments  @xcite .",
    "there has been criticisms of the method of post - selection as well , namely that the process of post - selection leads to throwing away data and can lead to suboptimal use of information from a measurement . for discussions on the same see  @xcite .",
    "we take a different approach in our work , where we do not do any post - selection i.e. we consider _ weak measurements without weak values_.      how exactly do we carry out the weak measurement ?",
    "how much is the effect of a weak measurement on the system ?",
    "if we carry out weak measurements on all the members of an identically prepared ensemble , what happens to such an ensemble ?",
    "we illustrate these points by taking an example .",
    "consider a measurement of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 component of spin ) of a qubit in a fixed quantum state .",
    "following the general prescription given in equation  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) we write the interaction hamiltonian as @xmath31 assuming the initial state of the pointer to be the same as that given in equation  ( [ pointer_in ] ) .",
    "the qubit is taken to be in a pure state given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the eigenstates of @xmath29 with eigen values @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the combined state of the system and the pointer after the interaction is given by taking a special case of equation  ( [ grand ] ) @xmath37 at this stage the apparatus and the system are in an entangled state .",
    "an observation of the apparatus will lead to values whose distribution is determined by the above state .",
    "it is clear from equation  ( [ grand_1 ] ) that the distribution of values of the apparatus is a gaussian centered around @xmath38 for the system input state @xmath33 and is a gaussian centered around @xmath39 for the system input state @xmath34 .",
    "the width of the gaussian in each case is given by @xmath40 . by tuning the parameter @xmath41",
    "we can change the nature of the measurement in terms of its strength . in our work",
    "we have taken @xmath42 so that we have @xmath43 . for large values of @xmath44",
    "we have a projective measurement , where the pointer distributions are well separated for the states @xmath45 and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , each reading of the pointer tells us exactly what the state of the system is after the measurement . by repeatedly measuring the same observable",
    "we can calculate the expectation value of the observable .",
    "the state collapses completely in each measurement and there is no question of re - using these states .",
    "however , when the value of @xmath44 is small we have two gaussians that overlap . from an observation of the pointer we do not learn with certainty as to what value to assign to the system spin @xmath30 component .",
    "the pointer positions are weakly correlated with the eigenstates of @xmath29 .",
    "the state is only partially affected and there is a possibility of re - using the state .",
    "the effect of the weak measurement in this case can be explicitly calculated and it turns out that there is very little change in the state of the system .",
    "the final state of the system can be calculated by taking the state in equation  ( [ grand ] ) and then taking a partial trace over the apparatus s degrees of freedom giving us the final mixed state corresponding to the system alone : @xmath46 since @xmath44 is small we can conclude that the disturbance caused to the system is also small . furthermore , the disturbance can be controlled by changing @xmath44 .",
    "we now turn to the question of using weak measurements with state recycling for the problem of state estimation of a single qubit .       and @xmath47 , allowing state recycling , followed by a projective measurement . ]    in our prescription , we consider a finite size ensemble of pure or mixed states of a qubit . on every member of the ensemble we carry out a @xmath29 measurement whose strength is defined by the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "we record the meter reading in each case and keep the modified states after measurements to obtain a changed ensemble .",
    "this new ensemble is now used to measure @xmath49 in the same way but with a coupling strength @xmath47 .",
    "finally the resultant ensemble is used to carry out projective measurement of @xmath50 on its members .",
    "the first two measurements are weak while the last measurement is strong or projective . to avoid statistical errors",
    "the results are averaged over many runs .",
    "the entire process is summarized in figure  [ flowchart_1 ] .",
    "for both the weak measurements , consider a regime in which @xmath44 is neither too large to make the measurement projective , nor too small , as is done in traditional weak measurements .",
    "for such values of @xmath44 , the two gaussians , representing the pointer value distributions for the two eigen values of the observable , overlap partially with each other .",
    "when there is no overlap , a meter reading unambiguously indicates an outcome and we have a projective measurement . a meter reading corresponding to a point in the overlap region",
    "can not be reliably correlated with the system being in one or the other eigenstate . to reduce this difficulty ,",
    "let us define a region , midway between the centers of the two gaussians , of width @xmath51 .",
    "we call it the discard region , which means that any pointer reading which falls in this region is rejected . for the case where we measure @xmath29 , all readings where the pointer position is to the right of this region",
    "are interpreted as indicating the value of @xmath29 to be @xmath35 while the ones on the left of this region are interpreted as @xmath36 . even when the outcome is discarded",
    ", the member of the ensemble is not rejected , but is retained to be re - used for the next measurement . in summary , in this scheme as is shown in figure  [ flowchart_1 ] we first measure @xmath29 weakly , followed by @xmath49 which is again measured weakly and last we make a projective measurement of @xmath50 .",
    "the entire simulation is run on identically prepared copies ( ensemble size ) of the state of interest ( pure or mixed ) .",
    "the simulation is repeated many times to avoid statistical errors .",
    "a general single qubit state is given by @xmath52 the diagonal elements are known as populations as they give the probabilities with which the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are present in the mixture .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are known as coherences as these contain the phase information of the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "when the state is coupled to a measurement device , as discussed above , the resultant state after unitary evolution for a strength @xmath44 , is @xmath55    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\otimes { \\left\\vert{q}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle{q'}\\right\\vert } \\label{grand_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us consider taking out a member of the ensemble of system states and then coupling it with the apparatus .",
    "now when the observer notes down the meter reading , she can see a particular reading which depends upon the initial states of the system and the meter and the coupling between the two .",
    "though this process is not well understood and von neumann s model is silent about this final step of collapse , it can be thought of as the action of the projector @xmath56 on the meter state resulting in the meter reading @xmath4 .",
    "the probability density of obtaining the value @xmath4 for the meter is therefore given by @xmath57 where the reduced density operator for the apparatus or the measuring device ( md ) is obtained by taking a partial trace of the state @xmath58 over the system .",
    "@xmath59 this probability density can now be used to calculate the probabilities of possible outcomes .",
    "for example , @xmath60 can be obtained by integrating the probability density from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the probabilities with which we obtain @xmath35 , @xmath36 or ambiguous readings while measuring in the @xmath30-basis are calculated by integrating the above probability densities from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , @xmath63 to @xmath64 and @xmath64 to @xmath61 , respectively and are given by    @xmath65 \\nonumber\\\\ p({\\left\\vert{1}\\right\\rangle})&=&\\frac{1}{4}\\left[-\\left(-1+z\\right ) erfc{\\frac{\\left(-1+a\\right)\\sqrt{\\epsilon_1}}{\\sqrt{2}}}+\\left(1+z\\right ) erfc{\\frac{(1+a)\\sqrt{\\epsilon_1}}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ p(discard_z)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left[erf{\\frac{\\left(-1+a\\right ) \\sqrt{\\epsilon_1}}{\\sqrt{2}}}+erf{\\frac{\\left(1+a\\right ) \\sqrt{\\epsilon_1}}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further for the second weak measurement , the input state is the output from the first measurement described by an ensemble @xmath66 .",

    "therefore we conclude that our scheme is preferable only when we have a small ensemble size .",
