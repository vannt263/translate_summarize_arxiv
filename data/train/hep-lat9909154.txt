    "domain - wall qcd ( dwqcd)@xcite is considered to have good properties such as exact chiral symmetry without doublers , no @xmath2 scaling violation and the existence of conserved axial current . there exist several pilot studies@xcite , which seems to support these superior properties .",
    "we study dwqcd in the quenched approximation .",
    "first we investigate the pion mass and the explicit breaking term of the axial ward - takahashi identity to confirm the existence of the chiral zero mode at zero current quark mass .",
    "next we calculate the pion decay constant @xmath1 from both the conserved axial current and the local axial current , using the perturbative renormalization factor@xcite for the latter , in order to check the reliability of the lattice perturbation theory .",
    "finally we explore negative @xmath3 region to examine the existence of the parity broken phase predicted in @xcite .",
    "the fermion action is identical to the original one@xcite , with domain wall height @xmath4 , bare quark mass @xmath3 and the extent of the 5th dimension @xmath5 .",
    "we employ 1030 gauge configurations , generated by the plaquette action at @xmath0 ( @xmath6 gev ) on @xmath7 lattices .",
    "the unit wall source without gauge fixing is used for quark propagators . the mean - field estimate for the optimal value of @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath8 with @xmath9 , gives @xmath10 , from @xmath11 for the wilson fermion at @xmath12 .",
    "first we investigate the existence of the chiral zero mode in the chiral limit of the model , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the pion mass squared is plotted as a function of @xmath15 in fig.[fig : mpi2_mf ] .",
    "since the linearity of @xmath16 in @xmath3 is well satisfied , we linearly extrapolate it to @xmath17 for each @xmath5 .",
    "we also evaluate a critical quark mass @xmath18 at which the pion mass squared vanishes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi2_ns ] , @xmath16 is plotted as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath190.025 , 0.050 , 0.075 and @xmath20 .",
    "extrapolated values of @xmath16 at @xmath17 seem to vanish exponentially in @xmath5 , while @xmath16 at finite @xmath3 remains non - zero . for @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 is already as small as that for the ng pion of the ks fermion at the same @xmath23 for the same spatial lattice size .",
    "furthermore @xmath24 and the wi - mass@xcite , defined by @xmath25 , also decrease exponentially in @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : itcx_ns ] .",
    "all these facts indicate that the chiral symmetry is restored for @xmath13 and @xmath26 at @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice scale @xmath27 is set by the @xmath28 meson mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrho_ns ] , @xmath29 is plotted as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "circles show linearly extrapolated values to @xmath17 , while squares show those to @xmath30 . for small @xmath31",
    "the two ways of extrapolation give different results , while two extrapolations are almost identical to each other for @xmath21 .",
    "we also find that the dependence of @xmath32 on the domain - wall height is mild for @xmath331.71.9 and @xmath21 : within statistical errors the extrapolated values are consistent with each other .",
    "the pion decay constant is defined as @xmath34 , which is obtained from correlation functions of pseudo scalar density @xmath35 and axial current @xmath36 at zero momentum : @xmath37 with @xmath38 for @xmath39 . for the renormalization factor for the axial current @xmath40",
    ", we take unity for the conserved current and use the value from the mean - field improved perturbation theory@xcite for the local current .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpisrnmplaq_m=1.819 ] , @xmath1 is shown as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "circles are obtained from @xmath41 for the conserved axial current , while squares from @xmath41 and diamonds from @xmath42 for the local axial current .",
    "the triangle is the experimental value . for local current , filled(open )",
    "symbols represent values with(without ) perturbative corrections .",
    "three different estimates reasonably agree for all @xmath3 within current statistics , if 1-loop corrections are included .",
    "it is also noted that the value of @xmath1 from the conserved current , linearly extrapolated at @xmath17 , is close to the experimental value .",
    "for finite @xmath5 , the parity broken phase may exist in negative @xmath3 regions . as @xmath5 increases",
    ", the broken phase shrinks rapidly , and the phase boundary , where the pion mass vanishes , converges to @xmath17@xcite . to examine this parity broken picture in dwqcd",
    ", we calculate pion masses at @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath10 .",
    "the pion propagators at these parameters form peculiar shapes similar to `` w '' character , which has been often observed for the wilson fermion near or in the parity broken phase .",
    "pion mass squared as a function of @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi2_mfneg ] . extrapolations of @xmath16 to zero both from positive and negative @xmath3 ( two largest @xmath3 are used for negative @xmath3 ) indicate that a parity broken phase may exist around @xmath45 at this parameter .",
    "needless to say , more high statistics and variation of parameters are necessary for the definite conclusion .",
    "at @xmath0 we have several indications that the chiral symmetry is restored at @xmath14 .",
    "we see that all three different estimates for @xmath1 are consistent with each other .",
    "this shows the mean - field improved perturbation theory works well at @xmath12 in dwqcd .",
    "although the value of @xmath1 at @xmath0 turns out to be compatible to the experimental one , detailed scaling studies at different @xmath23 s are needed before making the firm statement . the chiral symmetry in dwqcd ,",
    "however , may fail to recover on the coarse lattice@xcite .",
    "if this is true , the scaling studies of dwqcd become rather difficult .",
