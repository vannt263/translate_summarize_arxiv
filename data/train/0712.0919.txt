    "this is due to the fact that all quantities in the expressions above have an error of the same order of the predictor - corrector scheme .",
    "when considering polygonal particles , one must also take into account the shape of the particles . for polygons ,",
    "the decomposition of the elastic elongation @xmath21 into translational and rotational contributions is not as trivial as for discs .",

    "usually  @xcite one usually chooses the plane containing the intersection points and of the boundaries of the two touching particles .",
    "when there are only two intersection points there is a unique possible contact plane .",
    "however , due to the motion of the particles , the overlap between them may give rise to more than two intersecting points that yields different possible contact planes . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we illustrate a case where two different choices suit equally the condition above for a contact plane between two touching polygons .    in this section",

    "[ fig8 ] with the curve marked by bullets . on the contrary , contact planes taken from two intersection points of the two polygons present frequent discontinuities , as can be seen from the examples with squares in fig .",
    "such discontinuities occur since not only the size and orientation of the edges defining the overlap polygon vary in time , but also the _ number _ of edges .",
    "there is also the advantage that such a definition enables the system to behave as physically expected .",

    "the relaxation time associated with the discontinuous contact plane is smaller than when using our definition , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we introduced a technique to improve the accuracy of the numerical scheme used to compute the evolution of particle systems , showing that the range of admissible integration steps has an upper limit significantly smaller than previously assumed .",

    "when a larger system ( @xmath103 particles ) is studied , multiple contacts must be taken into account , which will yield an upper limit that we conjecture to be @xmath104 of the upper limit obtained above .",

    "<S> the approach improves efficiency and accuracy of the discrete element method ( dem ) when modeling the dynamics of the granular packing . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the proper upper limit for the integration step in the standard numerical scheme using a wide range of material parameters . to this end , we study the kinetic energy decay in a stress controlled test between two particles . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that the usual way of defining the contact plane between two polygonal particles is , in general , not unique which leads to discontinuities in the direction of the contact plane while particles move . to solve this drawback , we introduce an accurate definition for the contact plane based on the shape of the overlap area between touching particles , which evolves continuously in time .    ,    ,    granular media , discrete element method , slow deformation , contact forces .    83.10.-y , 45.70.-n , 45.70.cc , 02.60.-x </S>"
