    "the first experimental observation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite in bose atom vapors have initiated an exciting field of research , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one of the most interesting developments in this field is the formation of multi - component condensates .",
    "multi - component becs have been observed experimentally by myatt _",
    "_ @xcite and hall _",
    "et al._@xcite for two different hyperfine spin sates of @xmath2 , by modugno _",
    "@xcite for different atoms @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and papp _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for different isotopes of the same atom @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "a rich variety of various interesting effects exhibited by these two - component becs have inspired a number of theoretical studies covering various aspects of a these systems @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the bose systems in these experiments is that the intra - component and the inter - component boson - boson interactions are all repulsive .",
    "it rises the curiosity about the properties of a multi - component condensate in which one kind of atoms have repulsive interactions while another kind of atoms have attractive interactions .",
    "recently , fukuhara _",
    "et al._@xcite observed bec of spin - zero @xmath6 isotopes by implementing an all - optical cooling protocol .",
    "the bose - bose mixture in these experiments contain @xmath1 atoms having a positive s - wave scattering length and @xmath0 atoms having a negative s - wave scattering length@xcite .",
    "the s - wave scattering length between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is also positive@xcite .",
    "such a two - component condensate can be expected to show dynamical properties far more complex than a one - component condensate of attractively interacting bosons , which becomes unstable when the number of atoms exceed a critical value@xcite .",
    "for a two - component bec with attractive interactions between bosons in one component and repulsive interactions in the second component , two most basic questions are of that of its stability and that of the collapse dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we theoretically study the ground state as well as dynamic properties of such a two - component condensate in a three dimensional ( 3d ) anisotropic harmonic potential .",
    "we specifically consider the @xmath1-@xmath0 bose - bose mixture in the anisotropic harmonic confining potential as in the experiment of fukuhara _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical model for the study of a two - component bec . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the ground state profile of a stable two - component bec . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the collapse dynamics of the system and compare it with the experimental results@xcite .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the ground state and dynamic properties of a two component bose - einstein condensate ( bec)is well described by a set of coupled gross - pitaeveskii equations @xcite ( gpe ) given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are indices for the two components @xmath9@xmath10 for @xmath1 and @xmath11 for @xmath0@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the spatial coordinate vector , @xmath15 ) is the trapping potential , @xmath16 is the intra - species interaction and @xmath17 the inter - species interaction strength between atoms in the condensed state , @xmath18 is intra - species and @xmath19 is inter - species s - wave scattering length , @xmath20 is the reduced mass in which @xmath21 and @xmath22 are atomic masses .",
    "the normalization condition for each component is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is number of atoms in each component .",
    "we non - dimensionalize eq.@xmath25([nls_eqn ] ) through a set of linear transformations : @xmath26 . after dropping the wiggles on the symbols ,",
    "we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 since the masses of the two isotopes are nearly equal , we have taken @xmath30 . in order to find a stationary solution of eq.@xmath25([nls_non_dim_eqn ] ) , we do a separation of variables @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the chemical potential of the @xmath33th component . starting from eq.@xmath25([nls_non_dim_eqn ] ) , we obtain @xmath34",
    "in this section , we discuss the ground state properties of a two - component bec of yb isotopes by numerically solving the coupled gpe ( eq.@xmath25[stationary_state_eqn ] ) .",
    "the ground state solution of the gpe is found by the imaginary time propagation method . in this method , the time dependent gpe is evolved in imaginary time starting from an initial guess using a finite difference crank - nicholson ( fdcn ) scheme@xcite . in imaginary time propagation we have taken the space step as @xmath35 and the time step as @xmath36 .",
    "we have used a set of parameters corresponding to the @xmath1-@xmath0 system in the experiment@xcite : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .    due to the attractive interaction between @xmath0 atoms , the condensate of @xmath0 undergo a collapse if the particle number exceeds a critical value @xmath44 @xcite . for a single component @xmath0 this value is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for the parameters given above , @xmath48 .",
    "but , the critical number is modified due to the presence of @xmath1 atoms with a positive scattering length .",
    "the physical origin of this modification is in the effective potential felt by the bosons in the attractive component .",
    "the interaction with the repulsive component changes the effective potential from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "this reduces the effect of the attractive interaction and leads to a reduction of the critical number .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the mean - field contribution from the repulsive component leads to a flattening of the effective potential felt by the attractive component .",
    "if @xmath51 , then for the given parameters , @xmath44 is calculated to be @xmath52 by our numerical simulation . in order to prepare a stable condensate ,",
    "we have taken @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "the ground sate profile of the two - component bec is presented in fig .",
    "we observe that the @xmath0 atoms are at the center of trap and are surrounded by a large cloud of @xmath1 atoms .",
    "in this section , we study the collapse dynamics of a two component bec composed of @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms using the coupled time - dependent gpe s . due to the negative s - wave scattering length ,",
    "the @xmath0 condensate becomes unstable if the number of atoms becomes greater than a critical value @xmath44 .",
    "this condensate collapses by emitting atoms out of it .",
    "due to high density of atoms in the attractive condensate , the loss of atoms from the condensate occurs through three - body collisions . to model this collapse we add a imaginary three body quintic loss term @xcite to the rhs of gpe eq.@xmath25([nls_eqn ] ) given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the three - body loss coefficient for each component .",
    "we have neglected the two - body dipolar loss term as they make negligible contribution in this case@xcite .",
    "we have also left out the loss terms for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 collisions , since the losses due to these are comparatively small @xcite .",
    "so , eq.@xmath25([nls_non_dim_eqn ] ) becomes @xmath60 where @xmath61    we time evolve the coupled time - dependent gp equations eq.@xmath25([quintic gpe ] ) using the finite difference crank - nicholson ( fdcn ) scheme with a known initial condition . in real time propagation , we have taken the space step as @xmath35 and the time step as @xmath62 .",
    "the time evolution of the number of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is shown in fig . 2 along with the experimental data of fukuhara _ et al._@xcite . considering the complex dynamics of the the two - component system with mixed interactions",
    ", the theoretical results may be said to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we observe that there is a significant loss of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "we also see that the decay of @xmath0 is very rapid .",
    "it is due to the collapse of the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "the number of @xmath1 atoms does show a very small decrease , which is not visible on the scale of this figure . to understand the details of the decay process , we study the condensate profiles of each component at different times . the results are shown in the fig . 3 for @xmath0 and in fig . 4 for @xmath1 .",
    "at @xmath63 , the @xmath0 are at the center of the trap ( top left panel of fig .",
    "3 ) surrounded by @xmath1 ( top left panel of fig .",
    "4 ) . since the number of atoms in the attractive component is higher than the critical number for stability , the system is unstable .",
    "when the system evolves in time , the attractive component explodes as is evident from the spreading of this component with time , in real space , as shown in fig .",
    "the spiky structures in these figures represent the inhomogeneities produced due to the on - going explosion process .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the explosion also leads to a spread of the ground state profile . due to the coupling between the attractive and repulsive components ,",
    "the condensate of @xmath1 is also redistributed in real space during the time evolution , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . the numbers of remaining atoms in each condensate component during the time evolution , for a longer period of time ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we note that the best agreement with the experimental results ( fig .",
    "2 ) is obtained for the measured values of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the disagreement at later times is likely to be originating from the neglect of atomic loss due to collisions involving @xmath0 and @xmath1 . during the initial stages of the time evolution",
    ", the bosons distribution gets heavily mixed due to the explosion and due to the coupling between the two components .",
    "then , at later times , the inter - component collisions is likely to affect the atom loss .",
    "we are unable to include these loss terms since their values are not known at present .",
    "in this paper , we presented a study of some static and dynamic properties of a two - component bose condensate consisting of repulsively interacting @xmath1 atoms and attractively interacting @xmath0 atoms in an anisotropic harmonic confinement . in the stable state",
    ", the ground state has @xmath0 atoms in the center of the trap surrounded by @xmath0 atoms . when the number of atoms in the attractive component exceed a critical value ,",
    "the the system undergo a collapse .",
    "we analyzed the time evolution of this collapse process for the specific system parameters of the @xmath66-@xmath1 system studied in the experiment of fukuhara _",
    "et al._. the details of the collapse dynamics are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results .",
    "the critical number for stability of the attractive condensate is reduced by it s interaction with the repulsive condensate .",
