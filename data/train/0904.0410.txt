    "single transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in high energy hadronic reactions continue to attract much theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "they are defined as differences of cross sections when one of the initial hadrons transverse spin is flipped , divided by the sum : @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical description of ssas has proven to be a challenge  @xcite , since the leading collinear partonic contribution to the asymmetries vanishes  @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", there have been a number of theoretical developments that have led to much progress in the exploration of the underlying physics for single spin asymmetry phenomena .",
    "these developments mainly follow two lines : the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) approach  @xcite , which uses parton distributions and/or fragmentation functions that depend on partonic transverse momentum , and the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function approach  . more recently",
    ", it has been found in some cases that the two approaches are closely related and describe the same physics  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , phenomenological applications of the approaches have been limited to the `` bare '' parton model , that is , to the zeroth order of perturbation theory without any qcd corrections , as the latter were generally not available .",
    "this situation was remedied very recently when the leading - order ( lo ) kernels for the scale evolution of the relevant twist - three correlation functions were derived  @xcite . in this paper , we take a further step toward a more comprehensive qcd description of single - spin phenomena by calculating next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections for a particular observable , the transverse momentum weighted ssa in drell - yan lepton pair production .",
    "as demonstrated by many examples , next - to - leading order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) corrections are typically very important in hadronic processes .",
    "they often lead to significant @xmath1-factors , and also allow estimates of the size of yet higher order corrections . moreover , an nlo calculation for a particular physical process will provide a direct test of qcd factorization for the associated observable , complementing the general arguments for such factorizations  @xcite .",
    "one - loop pqcd corrections to the hard - scattering factors in the tmd factorization approach have been calculated for the observables associated with the so - called @xmath2-even tmd parton distributions  @xcite . for the related @xmath2-odd tmd observables , especially relevant for ssas in various processes , there has not been any particular calculation so far .",
    "the same is true for the twist - three approach , where all calculations for the ssas so far have been at leading order only  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that qcd corrections for higher - twist observables are much more complicated to obtain than for leading - twist ones  .",
    "this is related both to technical difficulties resulting from more complex partonic states , and to possible mixing between higher - twist matrix elements  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the recent developments , especially the consistency between the tmd approach and the twist - three approach found in  @xcite , have provided confidence in our understanding of the underlying theoretical description of single - spin phenomena .",
    "they naturally motivate a study of nlo corrections to ssa observables .",
    "the calculations and results of  @xcite will be the starting point for our derivation of the nlo corrections to the ssa in the drell - yan process . in this process , a transversely polarized nucleon with momentum @xmath3 scatters off an unpolarized nucleon ( @xmath4 ) to produce a virtual photon with invariant mass @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath6 , which subsequently decays into a lepton pair , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transverse polarization vector of the incident nucleon .",
    "the drell - yan process is bested suited as a first example for the calculation of nlo corrections to single - spin processes .",
    "it is among the simplest processes in hadronic scattering , and its single spin asymmetry is also kinematically simpler than those for other processes .",
    "for example , for scattering with single transverse polarization , the pair transverse momentum @xmath6 and the polarization vector @xmath8 are simply correlated as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath11 relative to that of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath11 is measured experimentally , the corresponding single spin asymmetry receives contributions from the so - called sivers effect in the tmd approach , applicable when @xmath13 , or from the twist - three qiu - sterman matrix elements when @xmath14 . as we mentioned above ,",
    "the two approaches coincide in the kinematic regime of overlap  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will make use of this fact .",
    "the transverse momentum of the virtual photon ( or the lepton pair ) generally depends on various transverse momenta in the process , namely those of the initial partons , and those generated by gluon radiation . for the cross section differential in transverse momentum",
    ", one has to be careful to classify the different contributions , as a tmd factorization only exists in the limit of small transverse momentum , @xmath13  .",
    "however , if we integrate over all transverse momentum @xmath6 , the cross section will depend only on the _ longitudinal _ momentum fraction of the virtual photon , and a collinear factorization approach will apply . for the single transverse - spin dependent cross section , we have to suitably weigh with transverse momentum in order to obtain a non - vanishing result , because the unintegrated cross section has linear dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "the weighted cross section is defined as  : @xmath15 where we have simplified the expression by omitting dependence on any other kinematic variables .",
    "since the transverse momentum has been integrated out , the above weighted cross section can be properly formulated in the collinear factorization approach  @xcite , and can be factorized into parton distributions and/or twist - three correlation functions for the incident nucleons , and partonic hard - scattering functions . in case of the ssa , the quark - gluon correlation function in the polarized nucleon will be an important ingredient in the factorization formula",
    ". it will be part of the following factorization formula for the above @xmath6-weighted cross section : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the anti - quark distribution of the unpolarized nucleon , and @xmath20 the qiu - sterman matrix element for quark @xmath21 . we have restricted ourselves here to one quark flavor ; extension to more flavors and to scattering off a quark from the unpolarized nucleon is trivial .",
    "in the following , we will drop the label @xmath21 of @xmath20 for simplicity . as indicated",
    ", @xmath22 is a function of two separate light - cone variables , and thus the convolution over momentum fraction will include both , as we will see .",
    "@xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the proper gauge link to make the matrix element gauge invariant , and where the sums over color and spin indices are implicit .    in the factorization formula eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the hard - scattering function can be expanded as a series in the strong coupling constant , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the leading order term , @xmath27 the nlo one , and so forth . in the following",
    ", we will demonstrate that the above factorization formula is valid at nlo level .",
    "in particular , the collinear divergence can be factorized into the parton distribution and quark - gluon correlation function , whereas the hard coefficient function is free of any divergence .",
    "the real - gluon radiation diagrams have already been studied in  @xcite , and the results can be carried over to our present calculation with relatively little effort .",
    "we will compute the virtual corrections as well .",
    "it is important to check that the soft divergence in real - gluon radiation is canceled by that in the virtual diagrams , so that we are left with only collinear divergences , which can be absorbed into the parton distribution and/or the twist - three correlation function , where they give rise to the scale evolution of the distributions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will derive the leading order expression for the hard coefficient , and calculate the virtual correction at next - to - leading order . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the real - gluon radiation contributions , and combine them with the virtual corrections .",
    "we will show that the soft divergence is canceled in the sum , and that the remaining collinear divergence can be removed by collinear factorization .",
    "we conclude our paper in sec . iv .",
    "at the leading order , the virtual photon is produced in the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess . in order to obtain a non - vanishing weighted transverse - spin - dependent cross section @xmath28",
    ", we have to include an initial state interaction as shown in fig .  1 , which provides the required phase  @xcite .",
    "we perform our calculations in covariant gauge .",

    "the transverse momentum @xmath37 flows through the perturbative diagram and returns to the polarized proton through the quark lines .",
    "the contribution to the single - transverse - spin asymmetry arises from terms linear in @xmath37 which , when combined with @xmath34 , yield @xmath38 , a part of the gauge field strength tensor @xmath39 . in order to compute this contribution",

    "however , because of momentum conservation it turns out that it is sufficient to allow transverse - momentum flow only through the radiated gluon .    before going into the calculation , we note that we will only consider contributions associated with the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function .",

    "this is different from what was discovered for the evolution equations for other twist - three quark distributions , such as @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where the evolution equations are closed ( diagonal ) in that limit  @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that the high-@xmath120 part of the evolution equation , i.e. , the large @xmath83 limit of the kernel in the integrand , is the same as that for the spin - averaged leading - twist quark distribution , because the term @xmath121 is the ordinary leading order quark splitting function",
    ". this property will have important phenomenological consequences  @xcite for the behavior of the quark - gluon correlation function at high @xmath120 and thus for ssas in hadronic processes at forward angles .",
    "we note that the renormalization and evolution of general twist - three quark - gluon operators has been extensively studied over the past two decades  .",
    "the above result for the evolution of the qiu - sterman matrix element should likely also be reproduced from the evolution equations discussed in some of these papers .",
    "however , we notice that the qiu - sterman matrix element corresponds to a very different projection of the general twist - three quark - gluon correlation function , and we do not expect that there will be a simple relation between the above evolution equation and those for other specific twist - three distributions such as @xmath122 .",
    "the comparison between the above results ( or the ones of  @xcite ) and those in   is very important and will be addressed in the future .",
    "after @xmath123 subtraction of the collinear divergences into the quark - gluon correlation function of the polarized nucleon and the anti - quark distribution of the unpolarized nucleon , we obtain the full nlo expression for the soft - gluon and hard - pole contributions to the transverse - momentum weighted single - spin dependent cross section in drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath124 collisions : @xmath125\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2cm}+g(x';\\mu^2)\\left[(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}t_f(x , x;\\mu^2 ) ) ( \\frac{-n_c^2}{2(n_c^2 - 1)})\\frac{1}{3}(1-z)(4 + 4z^2 - 5z)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2cm}+t_f(x , x;\\mu^2)t_r\\left((z^2+(1-z)^2)\\ln\\frac{q^2}{\\mu^2 } \\frac{(1-z)^2}{z}+2z(1-z)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2cm}\\left.\\left.+t_f(x , x;\\mu^2)\\frac{n_c^2}{2(n_c^2 - 1 ) } \\frac{1}{6}(8 - 27z+48z^2 - 29z^3)\\right]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2cm}+\\int\\frac{dv}{1-z } \\left(\\frac{1}{v_+}+ \\frac{1}{(1-v)_+}\\right)t_f(x , x\\frac{z}{1-v(1-z)};\\mu^2 ) \\bar",

    "it contributes in the same way to the spin - averaged and single - spin - dependent cross sections , and will lead to the same soft - gluon threshold resummation effects to these cross sections , at least at the leading double logarithmic level .",

    "in summary , we have derived the nlo perturbative - qcd correction to the transverse momentum weighted single spin asymmetry in drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic collisions . in the calculation , we have shown that the collinear divergences can be absorbed into the nlo twist - three quark - gluon correlation function of the transversely polarized nucleon and the unpolarized quark distribution of the unpolarized nucleon .",

    "we have found that both the evolution kernel and the full nlo expression for the spin - dependent cross section become identical to their spin - averaged counterparts in the `` threshold '' limit @xmath131 , or @xmath100 .",
    "this will likely have the phenomenological consequence that the single - spin asymmetry for the drell - yan process will be quite stable under nlo corrections , in particular when @xmath132 is large .",
    "it will be important to carry out further studies .",
    "we have mentioned already that it may be possible to derive the evolution of the twist - three correlation functions also from some of the results of  @xcite .",
    "also , it will be important to derive nlo corrections also for other processes .",
    "for example , extension to semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering should be relatively straightforward to do .",
