    "one of the possible candidates of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) observed in low - mass x - ray binaries is resonantly excited p- and/or g - mode oscillations in deformed disks ( kato 2004 , 2008a , b ; ferreira and ogilvie 2008 ; oktariani et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the disk deformation required in this model is a warp or an eccentric deformation in equatorial plane .",
    "recent numerical mhd simulations ( henisey et al . 2009 ) seem to have preliminary confirmed the presence of the excitation mechanism .",
    "the high frequency qpos observed in black - hole candidates appear in pairs with frequency ratio of 3 : 2 .",
    "this characteristic of high - frequency qpos in black - hole candidates seems to be described by the above model , if we assume that geometrically thin disks are surrounded by hot tori and that the qpos photons are disk photons comptonized in the tori ( kato and fukue 2006 ) .",
    "the twin khz qpos observed in neutron stars , on the other hand , have always not the 3 : 2 frequency ratio .",
    "they change their frequencies with time with correlation .",
    "if we want to describe such characteristics of khz qpos by the above model , a warp or eccentric disk deformation must have a time - dependent precession . in the case of neutron stars ,",
    "distinct from the case of black holes , such precession of the deformation might be expected , since the central stars have surfaces and this might become causes of time - dependent precession through magnetic and radiative couplings between the central sources and the disks .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether possible time - dependent precession of deformation has a time scale consistent with the time variations of the khz qpos .    in this context",
    ", it is worthwhile examining whether there are other kinds of disk deformations that can become a possible source of resonant excitation of high - frequency oscillations in disks .",
    "this problem has been examined by kato ( 2009 ) , and it was suggested that two - armed nearly vertical oscillations can excite high - frequency p- and/or g - mode oscillations .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to examine whether there are two - armed nearly vertical oscillation modes that can become a global deformation of disks .    more interestingly , the two - armed vertical disk oscillations themselves may be origins of the varous types of qpos observed in neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "this is because two - armed nearly vertical osillations occur in the inner region of disks and cover a wide range of frequency by difference of modes .",
    "based on these considerations , we examine in this paper basic properties of the two - armed vertical disk oscillations .",
    "that is , we examine their characteristics of trapping , eigen - frequency and its dependence on polytropic index specifying the vertical disk structure , using the mathematical formulations already prepared by silbergleit et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to study the trapping of the corrugation waves ( c - mode oscillations ) .",
    "before having a rough image of nearly vertical oscillations in vertically polytropic disks , we briefly mention nearly vertical oscillations in isothermal disks , because it is instructive to have a rough image of wave trapping in disks .",
    "if a disk oscillation with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath3 occur isothermally and locally in vertical direction in isothermal disks , the frequency , @xmath4 , is given by ( see , e.g. , okazaki et al .",
    "1987 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the node number ( @xmath7 ) of the oscillations in the vertical direction , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the angular velocity of disk rotation at the radius in consideration and the vertical epicyclic frequency at the radius .",
    "the oscillations are , however , can not be purely vertical by inhomogeneity of the disk in the radial direction .",
    "they essentially have horizontal velocity components .",
    "in other words , the vertical oscillations described by equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) are not rigorous .",
    "the vertical oscillations couple with purely horizontal inertial oscillations , @xmath10 , through pressure .",
    "if the coupling is considered with local approximations in the radial direction , we have a dispersion relation , which is written as ( okazaki et al .",
    "1987 ) @xmath11[(\\omega - m\\omega)^2-n\\omega_\\bot^2]=c_{\\rm s}^2k^2(\\omega - m\\omega)^2 , \\label{1.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the acoustic speed , @xmath13 is the horizontal epicyclic frequency , and @xmath14 is the horizontal wavenumber of the oscillations .    since we are now interested in nearly vertical oscillations , i.e. , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) , equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) shows that their propagation region in the radial direction is described by @xmath17 since @xmath9 is always larger than @xmath13 .",
    "we now proceed to polytropic disks with barotropic gas with polytropic index @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are pressure and density , respectively . the frequency , @xmath4 , of purely vertical oscillations is then given by ( silbergleit et al 2001 , kato 2005 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is @xmath23 the case of isothermal disks corresponds to @xmath24 .    in oscillations of @xmath25",
    ", @xmath26 is independent of @xmath2 , but in oscillations of @xmath27 it depends on @xmath2 .",
    "that is , for two - armed oscillations ( @xmath28 ) , equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) has solution given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is usually in the range of @xmath33 .",
    "an interesting result shown in equation ( [ 1.7 ] ) is that oscillations with @xmath34 can have low - frequencies for reasonable values of @xmath32 .    as in the case of isothermal disks",
    ", the nearly vertical oscillations are also not localized at a particular radius .",
    "they propagate in the radial direction .",
    "the propagation region is specified , as in the case of isothermal disks , by ( see section 4 for details ) @xmath35 the propagation diagram showing the propagation region of the oscillations in the radial direction is given in figure 1 for oscillations with @xmath25 and 2 , and in figure 2 for oscillations with @xmath34 .",
    "as the value of @xmath6 increases , the propagation region of oscillations becomes narrower in the frequency - radius plane ( i.e. , propagation diagram ) , and finally for oscillations with @xmath34 , the propagation region in the inner region of disks disappears for oscillations with @xmath36 .",
    "the next problem is to examine where the oscillations are really trapped and how much the frequency of the trapped oscillations is . to examine this problem ,",
    "a careful treatment of the wave equation is necessary and this is done in the subsequent sections . here",
    ", however , in order to have a rough image of trapping , we discuss qualitatively what determines the frequency of the trapped oscillations .",
    "let us assume tentatively that the frequency of the trapped oscillation is @xmath4 and the outer boundary of the trapped region is @xmath37 .",
    "the inner boundary of the trapped region , @xmath38 , is taken at the inner edge of the disks , which is @xmath39 when the central source has no spin , @xmath40 being the schwarzschild radius .",
    "then , roughly speaking , @xmath41 must be on the order of the wavelength of the trapped oscillations .",
    "if some kinds of mean values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the trapped region are denoted , respectively , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then the trapping condition is @xmath46 ( for the fundamental mode in the radial direction ) , since oscillations propagate in the radial direction as inertial acoustic waves .",
    "this trapping condition is realized only when @xmath4 has a particular value , say @xmath47 .",
    "this is because for @xmath48 , @xmath49 is too small compared with @xmath45 , since the width of the propagation region , i.e. , @xmath41 , is too narrow ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath50 , the value of @xmath49 becomes larger than @xmath45 , since the width , @xmath41 , becomes too large . to know the detailed value of @xmath47 for the trapping",
    ", we must make numerical calculations , as is done in the subsequent sections .    at this stage , without detailed numerical calculations , we can say that when @xmath32 is large , the frequency of the trapped oscillations is low , if other parameters , including the radial distribution of @xmath51 in disks , are fixed ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "let us assume that the trapping condition has satisfied for a frequency , say @xmath47 , when @xmath32 has a value , say @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath32 increases from @xmath52 , @xmath37 and thus @xmath41 decreases from the value in the above case , if the frequency @xmath4 is fixed at @xmath47 [ see equations ( [ 1.6 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) and curves in figures 1 and 2 ] . thus , the trapping condition is not satisfied at @xmath53 . for the trapping condition",
    "to be satisfied we must increase the width of the trapping region .",
    "this can be done by decreasing @xmath4 from @xmath47 .",
    "we consider geometrically thin , relativistic disks . for mathematical simplicity ,",
    "however , the effects of general relativity are taken into account only when we consider radial distributions of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "they are , in turn , the angular velocity of disk rotation , the epicyclic frequencies in the radial and vertical directions . except for them ,",
    "the newtonial formulations are adopted . since geometrically",
    "thin disks are considered , @xmath8 , is approximated to be the relativistic keplerian angular velocity , @xmath57 , when its numerical values are necessary . here , @xmath58 is the radial coordinate of cylindrical ones ( @xmath58,@xmath59,@xmath60 ) , where the @xmath60-axis is perpendicular to the disk plane and its origin is the disk center .",
    "functional forms of @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are given in many literature sources ( e.g. , kato et al . 2008 )    the disks are assumed to consist of a barotropic gas with polytropic index @xmath2 , i.e. , the pressure @xmath19 and density @xmath20 are related by @xmath61 .",
    "the hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction then gives ( e.g. , kato et al . 2008 ) @xmath62 @xmath63 where subscript 0 represents the quantities in the equilibrium state and 00 are those on the equatorial plane .",
    "the acoustic speed defined by @xmath64 is also given by @xmath65 where @xmath32 is related to @xmath2 by @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction also shows that the half - thickness @xmath68 of disks is related to @xmath51 and @xmath9 by @xmath69      we consider small - amplitude perturbations in the above disk .",

    "then , hydrodynamical equations describing them are ( e.g. , kato et al . 2008 ) @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined , respectively , by @xmath77 @xmath78 here , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the eulerian velocity , pressure , and density perturbations over the unperturbed ones , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) is the equation of continuity , equations ( [ 3.2 ] )  ( [ 3.4 ] ) are in turn the @xmath58- , @xmath59- , and @xmath60- components of equation of motion .",
    "elimination of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath81 from equations ( [ 3.1 ] )  ( [ 3.5 ] ) leads to a partial differential equation of @xmath75 . in the processes , we neglect the radial variations of the unperturbed density and some other quantities , assuming that their characteristic radial scales are longer than the characteristic radial wavelength of the perturbations",
    "then , we have an equation describing the variation of @xmath75 in the form : @xmath85 as is clear from the derivation processes , this equation is obtained under the framework of the newtonian hydrodynamics . a fully general relativistic",

    "in this paper we have examined characteristics of two - armed ( @xmath28 ) , nearly vertical oscillations , assuming that the disk consists of barotropic gases with polytropic index @xmath32 . the parameters specifying",
    "oscillation modes are @xmath6 and @xmath128 , where @xmath222 is the node number of @xmath75 in the vertical direction , and @xmath223 is the node number of @xmath75 in the horizontal direction .",
    "an additional important parameter is @xmath32 , which is especially important in oscillations with @xmath34 .",
    "main results obtained are i ) there are oscillation modes that are trapped in the inner region of disks , and ii ) their frequencies depend on modes of oscillations ( @xmath6 , @xmath128 ) and @xmath32 , and cover a wide range of frequency .",
    "that is , the trapped oscillations of @xmath25 and 2 have frequencies of the order of khz qpos , and those of @xmath34 are in the frequency range of the horizontal - branch qpos ( hbqpos ) .",
    "one of interesting characteristics of the oscillations is that their frequencies can change rather widely by change of disk structure , which is distinct from the g - mode oscillations trapped around the radius of @xmath224 ( okazaki et al .",
    "1987 ) , where @xmath224 is the maximum value of the epicyclic frequency .",
    "that is , as shown in figure 4 , the frequencies of trapped oscillations decrease by increase of @xmath32 , in the @xmath204 and @xmath34 modes . in the @xmath25 modes , however , their frequencies are insensitive to a variation of @xmath32 ( see figure 4 ) . this can be easily understood if we consider the @xmath32-dependence of the boundary curve specifying the capture radius on the propagation diagram [ see figures 1 and 2 , and also equations ( [ 1.6 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) ] .    in this paper we did not quantitatively consider the effects of @xmath225 on frequency .",
    "an increase of @xmath175 without any change of other parameters leads to decrease of frequency of trapped oscillations .",
    "the reason is that an increase of @xmath175 decreases @xmath226 .",
    "hence , to satisfy the trapping condition ( [ 3.24 ] ) , an increase of @xmath37 is necessary , which leads to decrease of frequency ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . in table 1 , the effects of changes of various parameter values on frequencies of trapped oscillations are summarized .",
    "one of important problems remained is whether the nearly vertical oscillations considered in this paper can be really excited on disks .",
    "two possibilities will be conceivable .",
    "one is the excitation by the process of viscous overstability of oscillations ( kato 1978 ) .",
    "this , however , might be inefficient to some types of oscillations , especially to oscillations with large @xmath6 .",
    "another and more promising process is the stochastic excitation of oscillations by turbulence , developed first by goldreich and keely ( 1977a , b ) .",
    "this is known as the excitaion process of solar and stellar non - radial oscillations .",
    "this process is better than the former in the sense that it will be able to excite many types of oscillations , without no particular selection concerning the forms of eigenfunctions .",
    "so far , we did not discuss the effects of corotation resonance on the present trapped oscillations .",
    "it is known that non - axisymmetric g - mode oscillations are generally damped by corotation resonance ( kato 2003 ; li et al .",
    "2003 ; latter & balbus 2009 ; see also silbergleit & wagoner 2008 ) .",
    "the c - mode oscillations , which are non - axisymmetric , are also damped by the resonance ( tsang & lai 2009 ) .",
    "these results are related to the fact that these oscillations have node(s ) in the vertical direction .",
    "the vertical oscillations considered in this paper have also node(s ) in the vertical direction .",
    "the oscillations , however , have an important difference from g- and c - mode oscillations .",
    "that is , in the case of two - armed nearly vertical oscillations , the radius of coratation resonance , i.e. , the radius where @xmath227 is realized , is far outside the propagation region ( see the curve of @xmath228 in figure 1 ; the curve of @xmath228 is not shown in figure 2 , since it is outside the diagram ) . in the evanescent region",
    "the wave amplitude is spatially damed exponentially .",
    "hence , the effects of corotation damping are negligible in the present oscillations",
    ".    it will be important to note here that the effects of the general relativity are not essential in the trapping of the present vertical oscillations , except for the modes with @xmath25 .",
    "the propagation region of the vertical oscillations is specified by inequality ( [ 1.8 ] ) . in deriving inequality ( [ 1.8 ] ) , the fact that @xmath229 is larger than @xmath230 is adopted . in the case of oscillation modes of @xmath25 ,",
    "the general relativity is necessary to guarantee this , since @xmath231 . in oscillations with @xmath232 , however , @xmath233 is guarantees even in newtonian disks .",
    "other important ingredients for presence of trapped oscillations are the presence of inner edge of disks where waves are reflected back and a monotonical decrease of angular velocity of rotation , @xmath54 , outwards .",
    "this point is different from trapping of g - mode oscillations , since in trapping of g - mode oscillations , the general relativity is essential . if we want to describe the qpos in disks extending from black - hole or neutron star systems to dwarf - novae systems by a common mechanism , the nearly vertical oscillations considered here will be one of good candidates , since in the disks of dwarf - novae the effects of the general relativity are minor .",
    "we have shown that there are various modes of nearly vertical oscillations trapped in the inner region of disks . from the observational points of view",
    ", however , the oscillations with @xmath25 and @xmath204 may not be so interesting , since their trapped regions are too narrow as shown in figures 1 and 3 , and may not be observed with large amplitudes , although the trapped regions are close to the inner edge of disks .",
    "compared with them , the oscillations with @xmath34 will be of interest , since their trapped region is wide as shown in figures 2 and 3 . in this sense , the @xmath34 modes will be one of possible candidates of low frequency qpos such as horizontal - branch qpos ( hb qpos ) .",
    "further discussion on this direction will be worthwhile .",
    "related to this , there are some issues to be noted here .    first , we have found that low frequency oscillations with @xmath34 are present only in disks with @xmath234 .",
    "hence , one may imagine that such oscillations can not be expected in neutron - star disks , since the standard disk model shows that the main part of the disks is gas - pressure - dominated .",
    "we should notice , however , that in disks with high accretion rate ( accretion rate is close to or higher than the critical accretion rate defined by the eddington luminosity ) , a radiation - pressure - dominated region appears in the innermost part of disks .",
    "in particular , in slim disks the whole region is radiation - pressure - dominated . furthermore , we should notice that it is unnecessary to regard the index @xmath32 as the same as the ratio of the specific heats , @xmath235 , of the disk gas .",
    "in practice , we can expect @xmath236 by the following reasons . due to radiation from a hot corona ,",
    "disks have tendency to approach isothermal disks in the vertical direction .",
    "furthermore , in low frequency oscillations , radiative heat transport tends to make the oscillations isothermal , although as another effect it may dampen oscillations .",
    "second , the oscillations with @xmath34 are trapped in a rather wide region , , i.e. , the radial wavelength is long .",
    "hence , it will be necessary to take into account some terms neglected in deriving equation ( [ 3.7- ] ) , including the terms of relativistic corrections , when we want to do more quantitative estimate of oscillation frequencies .",
    "finally , we should mention a difference between the low frequency oscillations with @xmath34 discussed in this paper and the low - frequency one - armed corrugation waves ( kato 1989 , silbergleit et al .",
    "the latter oscillations are a kind of warps or tilts , and roughly an incompressible deformation of disks , while the former are compressible oscillations ."
