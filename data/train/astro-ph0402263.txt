    "cosmological models based on the anomaly - induced effective action of gravity take into account the vacuum quantum effects of particles in the early universe .",
    "these models naturally lead to inflation , which is a direct consequence of the assumption that , at high energies , all particles can be described by massless , conformally invariant fields with negligible interaction between them .",
    "@xcite@xcite    in the modified version of the original starobinsky model @xcite [ modified starobinsky model ( msm ) ] , it was assumed that some of the scalar and fermion fields are massive .",
    "@xcite@xcite if we also assume a supersymmetric particle content , inflation is , then , stable during the period which starts at a sub - planck scale , continuing almost until the end of inflation , when most of the sparticles decouple .",
    "@xcite@xcite subsequently , the universe enters into an unstable regime , eventually undergoing a transition to the frw evolution .",
    "it is to be noted that this occurs without any need for fine - tuning , regardless of the values of the cosmological constant @xmath3 and the curvature parameter @xmath4 .",
    "in fact both the cosmological constant @xmath3 and the curvature @xmath4 are very small in the context of the high - t early universe .",
    "present observations indicate that the curvature @xmath4-term is less than @xmath5 of the energy density term in the friedmann equation and that the @xmath3 term is comparable to the energy density term in the @xmath3cdm model . extrapolating back to the high - t early universe , the @xmath4-term is then @xmath6 and the @xmath3 term @xmath7 of the energy density term .",
    "the @xmath4-term is thus not included in our equations and the @xmath3-term is included up to eq.([parabola ] ) , just for completeness .",
    "we set @xmath8 in the equations after eq.([parabola ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to solve analytically the equation for the cosmological scale factor @xmath9 in the msm .",
    "however an approximate solution for @xmath9 during inflation was obtained and confirmed by numerical analysis with very high precision .",
    "we assume here that an effective inflaton potential ( eip ) that reproduces the time dependence of @xmath9 of the msm during the inflationary period can be used to make predictions of the msm throughout this period , including its end .",

    ", the fields decouple from the conformal factor of the metric . in this case , the dominating quantum effect is the trace anomaly , which comes from the renormalization of the conformal invariant part of the vacuum action , @xcite @xmath15 where the first term contains higher derivatives of the metric , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the einstein - hilbert term , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the parameters of the vacuum action .",
