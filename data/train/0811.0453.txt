    "the basic idea of content zoning is to segment texts on the basis on pre - defined categories , called zones .",
    "a zone can be described as a set of sentences or paragraphs describing the same topic owning a zone name to reflect the topic . in a first approach to content zoning ( @xcite ) ,",
    "this has been applied to the analysis of spam emails - as means to separate spam from non - spam electronic mails .",
    "an important aspect in the zoning of texts is its structuring in itself - that has to be learned .",
    "technically , a structuring is a composition of zones that are related to pre - defined actors , but that may form a fundament for continuing operations like the summarization of the story or the characterization of the authors .",
    "the described engine cozo+ is a prototypical implementation .",
    "cozo+ is a zoning engine and an extension to cozo ( @xcite ) .",
    "cozo+ consists of two main modules , which is a pre - processing module and a text - stream processing module ( see figure [ img : cozo ] ) .",
    "generally , we have concerned with documents written in the english language only .    in the text pre - processing module ,",
    "these documents are read and sent to the application memory .",
    "we remove diverse formats of the document , for example paragraphs , line - breaks , etc . for having a continuous flow of text .",
    "then , a part - of - speech tagger processes the prepared document to annotate the words with grammatical tags .",
    "we consider a text stream as an endless flow of text from one point to another . for managing text streams ,",
    "the user has to define a text window which indicates the text stream length for the streaming in unit sentences .",
    "this text window serves as basis for the text streams , where a text window of a size of n sentences fixed by the user , is read - in into the text processing module .",
    "the text stream processing module is composed of three sub - modules , namely a parser that is additionally featured with an anaphor resolution , the content zoning itself , and the evaluation module .",
    "the parsing of the stream is to determine the text into subject , verb , object relations in sentences . with these word relations , anaphors for the third person pronouns singular ( he , she ) and plural (",
    "they ) can be resolved .",
    "the modified text stream is then passed to the content zoning module to extract content for user - defined actors / zones .    by applying grammatical search queries or rules , information about user - defined actors",
    "can be extracted into zones .",
    "after the zoning of a text stream , this text stream is lost .",
    "the last module in cozo+ is the statistical evaluation of the zoned content for each zone , the mind - map structure generation with the statistical evaluation .",
    "the mind - map can be described as incremental and adaptive tree - like mind - map structure displaying the results of the zones .",
    "zone variables can be described as parameters for analyzing _ zoned _ content to gain further information about these zones .",
    "diverse statistics about the size , a semantic and contextual analysis of the text content , the extraction of semantic or grammatical content of a zone , and much more can automatically be performed while finding relevant zones . in this respect ,",
    "interesting zone variables are for example _ the most occurring word _ or the _ most occurring sentence structure_.    an additional information in a zone is the gender ( male , female ) for the user - defined actor , used for pronoun resolution of main actors .",
    "an example for illustrating the effect of content zoning might be the following text having two actors _ harry _ and _ hedwig_. here , the raw text is read word by word , and the actor - based zones are assigned in case the actor name or a pronoun occurs or in case that the zone is still open ( see [ seccozoarchitecture ] ) . if a pronoun - being an anaphor at this time - occurs , it must become solved ( see [ aresolution ] ) .    .... [ harry ] harry got up off the floor , stretched , moved across to his desk .",
    "harry neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers .",
    "[ /harry ]   [ hedwig ] hedwig made no movement as she began to flick through newspapers , throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one .",
    "she was asleep or else faking .",
    "she was angry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment .",
    "[ hedwig ] ....    as evaluation measurement a quality factor is introduced .",
    "the quality criterion is defined as a set of two parameters , representing the completeness and the correctness .",
    "they are called the _ matching _ and the _ error rate_. the _ matching _ is defined as a measure for * completeness * of the zoning , it is defined as to be _ complete _ for human beings , which means that _ all _ relevant sentences are zoned for a given actor , so that its resulting human matching is per se said to be exactly one .",
    "@xmath0    the _ error rate _ is defined as a measure for * correctness * of a zoning .",
    "it is described as the ratio between wrongly zoned sentences for an actor ( by cozo+ ) , the difference of all sentences of a given text , and the manually zoned sentences .",
    "the human zoning is considered to be 100% _",
    "correct_. a human zoning does not contain any erronous zoned sentences , so its resulting error - rate is per se said to be exactly null .",
    "cozo+ is implemented with a graphical user interface ( see figure [ img : cozogui ] ) .",
    "this allows users to make their content zoning on text of different domains .",
    "first , the user selects the text , the actors to be zoned , and finally the window size , which consists of a list of potential candidates for the pronoun resolution .",
    "the zones are then displayed in a separate window , as well as the parsed tree and diverse statistical values .",
    "cozo+ has been applied to different text domains , namely first online news articles , secondly , lifestyle articles about various topics , thirdly , biographies of famous inventors , fourth , fairy tales , fifth , theatre pieces , and , sixth , to scientific texts .",
    "the text size ranges between 300 up to 7000 words for a text .",
    "the shortest text category are online newspaper articles , the largest are chapters from books .",
    "[ aresolution ] anaphor resolution has been done in content zoning for incrementing the content zoning quality .",
    "a simple search query matching does not provide satisfying results . by resolving anaphors ,",
    "more sentences can be zoned as this focuses on actors in texts . in this respect ,",
    "results become improved through the resolution process of the third person singular ( he / his / him / she / her ) and plural ( they / their ) .",
    "the success - rate for pronominal anaphors can be defined as the correctly solved anaphors for a given actor in cozo+ concording with all manually counted anaphors for a given actor for an anaphoric category divided by all manually counted / solved anaphors for a given actor .",
    "the results of the success - rates for anaphor resolution in cozo+ are illustrated in table [ aresolution ] .",
    ".anaphor resolution accuracy table [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented a engine for the zoning of content as it was initially introduced in @xcite .",
    "the engine consists of several modules that process incoming texts by firstly removing any formats , resolving pronouns to his corresponding actor , and finally outputs the texts including the zones .",
    "as it has been tested on various domains , the zoning results are quite promising and close to a manual zoning by humans",
    ". a next step will be the refinement of the zoning learning as the current zoning result is coarse - grained , keeping too much noise inside .",
