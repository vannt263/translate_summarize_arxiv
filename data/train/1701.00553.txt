    "the study of @xmath0 ( parity  time ) symmetric systems was initiated through the works of bender and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "originally , it was proposed as an alternative to the standard quantum theory , where the hamiltonian is postulated to be hermitian . in these works , it was instead found that hamiltonians invariant under @xmath0-symmetry , which are not necessarily hermitian , may still give rise to completely real spectra .",
    "thus , the proposal of bender and co - authors was that these hamiltonians are appropriate for the description of physical settings . in the important case of schrdinger - type hamiltonians , which include the usual kinetic - energy operator and the potential term , @xmath1 , the @xmath0-invariance is consonant with complex potentials , subject to the constraint that @xmath2 .",
    "a decade later , it was realized ( and since then it has led to a decade of particularly fruitful research efforts ) that this idea can find fertile ground for its experimental realization although not in quantum mechanics where it was originally conceived . in this vein , numerous experimental realizations sprang up in the areas of linear and nonlinear optics  @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , and mechanical systems @xcite , among others .",
    "very recently , this now mature field of research has been summarized in two comprehensive reviews  @xcite .",
    "one of the particularly relevant playgrounds for the exploration of the implications of @xmath0-symmetry is that of nonlinear optics , especially because it can controllably involve the interplay of @xmath0-symmetry and nonlinearity . in this context , the propagation of light ( in systems such as optical fibers or waveguides  @xcite ) is modeled by the nonlinear schrdinger equation of the form : @xmath3 in the optics notation that we use here , the evolution direction is denoted by @xmath4 , the propagation distance . here ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to two spatial dimensions and assume that the potential @xmath5 is complex valued , representing gain and loss in the optical medium , depending on the sign of the imaginary part ( negative for gain , positive for loss ) of the potential . in this two - dimensional setting , the condition of full @xmath0-symmetry in two dimensions is that @xmath6 .",
    "potentials with full @xmath0 symmetry have been shown to support continuous families of soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "however , an important recent development was the fact that the condition of ( full ) @xmath0 symmetry can be relaxed .",
    "that is , either the condition @xmath7 or @xmath8 of , so - called , partial @xmath0 symmetry can be imposed , yet the system will still maintain all real spectra and continuous families of soliton solutions @xcite .    in the original contribution of  @xcite ,",
    "only the focusing nonlinearity case was considered for two select branches of solutions and the stability of these branches was presented for isolated parametric cases ( of the frequency parameter of the solution ) .",
    "our aim in the present work is to provide a considerably more `` spherical '' perspective of the problem . in particular",
    ", we examine the bifurcation of nonlinear modes from _ all three _ point spectrum eigenvalues of the underlying linear schrdinger operator of the partially @xmath0-symmetric potential . upon presenting the relevant model ( section 2 ) ,",
    "we perform the relevant continuations ( section 3 ) unveiling the existence of nonlinear branches _ both _ for the focusing and for the defocusing nonlinearity case .",
    "we also provide a systematic view towards the stability of the relevant modes ( section 4 ) , by characterizing their principal unstable eigenvalues as a function of the intrinsic frequency parameter of the solution . in section 5 ,",
    "we complement our existence and stability analysis by virtue of direct numerical simulations that manifest the result of the solutions dynamical instability when they are found to be unstable . finally , in section 6 , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as discuss some possibilities for future studies .",
    "motivated by the partially @xmath0-symmetric setting of  @xcite , we consider the complex potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 with real constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the potential is chosen with partial @xmath0-symmetry so that @xmath7 .",
    "that is , the real part is even in the @xmath14-direction with @xmath15 and the imaginary part is odd in the @xmath14-direction with @xmath16 .",
    "the constants @xmath17 are chosen such that there is no symmetry in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the spectrum of the potential @xmath19 can be all real as long as @xmath20 is below a threshold value , after which a ( @xmath0- ) phase transition occurs ; this is a standard property of @xmath0-symmetric potentials .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath21 and @xmath22 for which the spectrum is real , i.e. , below the relevant transition threshold .",
    "figure  [ figvw ] shows plots of the potential @xmath19 .",
    "the real part of the potential is shown on the left , while the imaginary part associated with gain - loss is on the right ; the gain part of the potential corresponds to @xmath23 and occurs for @xmath24 , while the loss part with @xmath25 occurs for @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ figvweigs ] shows the spectrum of @xmath19 , i.e. , eigenvalues for the underlying linear schrdinger problem @xmath27 .",
    "the figure also shows the corresponding eigenvectors for the three discrete real eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "it is from these modes that we will seek bifurcations of nonlinear solutions in what follows .",
    ", left panel ) and imaginary ( @xmath29 , right panel ) parts of the potential @xmath19 with @xmath30 . , width=336 ]     in the complex plane ( see also the text ) .",
    "plots of the magnitude of the normalized eigenvectors for the three discrete eigenvalues @xmath28 are shown in the other three plots.,width=336 ]",
    "as is customary , we focus on stationary soliton solutions of ( [ nls ] ) of the form @xmath31 .",
    "thus one obtains the following stationary equation for @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 in @xcite it is discussed that a continuous family of solitons bifurcates from each of the linear solutions in the presence of nonlinearity . in order to see this",
    "let @xmath28 be a discrete simple real eigenvalue of the potential @xmath19 ( such as one of the positive real eigenvalues in the top left plot of fig .",
    "[ figvweigs ] ) .",
    "now , following  @xcite , expand @xmath32 in terms of @xmath34 and substitute the expression @xmath35 \\label{epsexpand}\\ ] ] into equation ( [ stateq ] ) .",
    "this gives the equation for @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 here , @xmath40 plays the role of the adjoint solution to @xmath41 .",
    "thus in order to find solutions of ( [ stateq ] ) for @xmath42 we perform a newton continuation in the parameter @xmath43 where the initial guess for @xmath44 is given by the first two terms of ( [ epsexpand ] ) .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure [ muvpow ] shows how the ( optical ) power @xmath45 of the solution grows as a function of increasing @xmath43 for @xmath46 , or as a function of decreasing @xmath43 for @xmath47 ( from the linear limit ) .",
    "the first branch begins at the first real eigenvalue of @xmath19 at @xmath48 , the second branch at @xmath49 , and the third branch begins at @xmath50 .",
    "plots of the solutions and their corresponding time evolution and stability properties are shown in the next section .    as a general starting point comment for the properties of the branches ,",
    "we point out that all the branches populate both the gain and the loss side . in the branch starting from @xmath48 , all 4 `` wells '' of the potential of fig .",
    "[ figvw ] appear to be populated , with the lower intensity `` nodes '' being more populated and the higher intensity ones less populated .",
    "the second branch starting at @xmath49 , as highlighted also in  @xcite , possesses an anti - symmetric structure in @xmath14 ( hence the apparent vanishing of the density at the @xmath51 line ) .",
    "both in the second and in the third branch , the higher intensity nodes of the potential appear to bear a higher intensity .",
    "plotted in terms of the continuation parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the curves begin at the lowest power ( i.e. , at the linear limit ) at the discrete real eigenvalues of approximately @xmath52 ( branch 1 ) , @xmath53 ( branch 2 ) , @xmath54 ( branch 3 ) .",
    "each power curve is drawn with its corresponding stability noted : a blue solid curve denotes a stable solution and a red dashed curve denotes an unstable solution .",
    "the other three plots track the maximum real part of eigenvalues @xmath55 as a function of the continuation parameter @xmath43 : the red dashed line represents the max real part of eigenvalues that are real ( exponential instability ) while the blue dotted line tracks the max real part for eigenvalues that have nonzero imaginary part ( quartets ) ; this case corresponds to oscillatory instabilities . , width=336 ]    the natural next step is to identify the stability of the solutions .",
    "this is predicted by using the linearization ansatz : @xmath56 \\right)\\ ] ] which yields the order @xmath57 linear system @xmath58 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a\\\\ b \\end{array } \\right ] = -i \\nu \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a\\\\ b \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath61 corresponds to instability and @xmath62 corresponds to ( neutral ) stability .    in the bottom left panel of figure [ muvpow ]",
    "the power curve is drawn with stability and instability as determined by @xmath55 noted by the solid or dashed curve , respectively .",
    "the other three plots in figure [ muvpow ] show the maximum real part of eigenvalues @xmath55 for each of the three branches : the red dashed curve is the max real part of real eigenvalue pairs , and the blue dotted curve is the max real part of eigenvalue quartets with nonzero imaginary part .",
    "the former corresponds to exponential instabilities associated with pure growth , while the latter indicate so - called oscillatory instabilities , where growth is present concurrently with oscillations . in figure [ eigs ]",
    "we plot some example eigenvalues in the complex plane for some sample unstable solutions .",
    "the dominant unstable eigenvalues within these can be seen to be consonant with the growth rates reported for the respective branches ( and for these parameter values ) in fig .",
    "[ muvpow ] .     for a few representative solutions .",
    "one can compare the maximal real part with figure [ muvpow ] .",
    "for example , the top left complex plane plot here shows that for branch 1 at @xmath63 the eigenvalues with maximum real part are complex ; this agrees with the top left plot of figure [ muvpow ] where at @xmath63 the blue dotted curve representing complex eigenvalues is bigger .",
    "similarly one can check the other three eigenvalue plots here also agree with what is shown in figure [ muvpow ] , the top right for branch 1 , the bottom left for branch 2 and the bottom right for branch 3.,width=336 ]    the overarching conclusions from this stability analysis are as follows .",
    "the lowest @xmath43 branch , being the ground state in the defocusing case , is always stable in the presence of the self - defocusing nonlinearity . for the parameters considered ,",
    "generic stability is also prescribed for the third branch under self - defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "the middle branch has a narrow interval of stability and then becomes unstable , initially ( as shown in the top right of fig .",
    "[ muvpow ] ) via an oscillatory instability and then through an exponential one . in the focusing case ( that was also focused on in  @xcite for the second and third branch )",
    ", all three branches appear to be stable immediately upon their bifurcation from the linear limit , yet , all three of them subsequently become unstable .",
    "branch 1 ( that was not analyzed previously ) features a combination of oscillatory and exponential instabilities .",
    "branch 2 features an oscillatory instability which , however , only arises for a finite interval of frequencies @xmath43 , and the branch restabilizes . on the other hand , branch 3 ,",
    "when it becomes unstable it is through a real pair .",
    "branches 2 and 3 terminate in a saddle - center bifurcation near @xmath64 .",
    "the eigenvalue panels of fig .",
    "[ eigs ] confirm that the top panels of branch 1 may possess one or two concurrent types of instability ( in the focusing case ) , branch 2 ( bottom left ) can only be oscillatorily unstable in the focusing case ( yet as is shown in fig .",
    "[ muvpow ] it can feature both types of instabilities in the defocusing case ) , while branch 3 , when unstable in the focusing case is so via a real eigenvalue pair .",
    "figures [ rkp1 ] , [ rkp2 ] , [ rkp3 ] show the time evolution of three unstable solutions , one on each branch .",
    "all three time evolution examples we show here have a value of @xmath65 .",
    "that is , they each correspond to a mu - value that is bigger than the initial discrete value @xmath28 and pertain to the focusing case .",
    "the time evolution figures show a similar feature for the unstable solutions , namely that over time the magnitude of the solutions will increase on the left side of the spatial grid .",
    "this agrees with what is expected from @xmath0-symmetry since the left side of the spatial grid corresponds to the gain side of the potential @xmath19 .",
    "importantly , also , the nature of the instabilities varies from case to case , and is consonant with our stability expectations based on the results of the previous section .    in fig .",
    "[ rkp1 ] branch 1 ( for the relevant value of the parameter @xmath43 ) features an oscillatory instability ( but with a small imaginary part ) . in line with this",
    ", we observe a growth that is principally exponential ( cf . also the top panel for the power of the solution ) , yet features also some oscillation in the amplitude of the individual peaks .",
    "it should be noted here that although two peaks result in growth and two in decay ( as expected by the nature of @xmath29 in this case ) , one of them clearly dominates between the relevant amplitudes .    .",
    "the bottom left plot shows the magnitude of the solution @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "observe that this solution has four peaks in its magnitude over the two - dimensional spatial grid .",
    "the bottom right plot shows the solution at @xmath68 .",
    "observe that the magnitudes of the peaks on the left side have increased .",
    "the top left plot shows the time evolution of the power of the solution as a function of the evolution variable @xmath4 .",
    "the top right plot here shows the evolution of the four peaks in the magnitude of the solution as a function of @xmath4 ( blue = bottom left peak , red = top left peak , green = bottom right peak , cyan = top right peak ) . , width=336 ]    in fig .",
    "[ rkp2 ] , it can be seen that branch 2 , when unstable in the focusing case , is subject to an oscillatory instability ( with a fairly significant imaginary part ) .",
    "hence the growth is not pure , but is accompanied by oscillations as is clearly visible in the top left panel . in this case , among the two principal peaks of the solution of branch 2 , only the left one ( associated with the gain side ) is populated after the evolution shown .",
    "( the final evolution distance however is about @xmath69 ) .",
    "here the plots correspond to the time evolution of the branch 2 solution for the value @xmath70 . in the top right plot",
    ", the blue curve corresponds to the left peak of the magnitude of the solution over @xmath4 and the green corresponds to the right peak of the magnitude . , width=336 ]",
    "lastly , in branch 3 , the evolution ( up to @xmath71 ) manifests the existence of an exponential instability .",
    "the latter leads once again the gain part of the solution to indefinite growth resulting in one of the associated peaks growing while the other ( for @xmath26 on the lossy side ) featuring decay .",
    "( with an evolution up to distance @xmath71 ) . here , the plots correspond to the evolution of the branch 3 solution for the value @xmath72 . in the top right plot",
    ", the blue curve corresponds to the left peak of the magnitude of the solution over @xmath4 and green corresponds to the right peak of the magnitude .",
    "clearly , once again , the gain side of the solution eventually dominates . , width=336 ]    it is worthwhile to mention that in the case of branch 2 , the only branch that was found ( via our eigenvalue calculations ) to be unstable in the self - defocusing case , we also attempted to perform dynamical simulations for @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , in all the cases considered it was found that , fueled by the defocusing nature of the nonlinearity , a rapid spreading of the solution would take place ( as @xmath4 increased ) , leading to a rapid interference of the results with the domain boundaries .",
    "for that reason , this evolution is not shown here .",
    "in the present work , we have revisited the partially @xmath0-symmetric setting originally proposed in  @xcite and have attempted to provide a systematic analysis of the existence , stability and evolutionary dynamics of the nonlinear modes that arise in the presence of such a potential for both self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "it was found that all three linear modes generate nonlinear counterparts .",
    "generally , the defocusing case was found to be more robustly stable than the focusing one . in the former ,",
    "two of the branches were stable for all the values of the frequency considered , while in the focusing case , all three branches developed instabilities sufficiently far from the linear limit ( although all of them were spectrally stable close to it ) .",
    "the instabilities could be of different types , both oscillatory ( as for branch 2 ) and exponential ( as for branch 3 ) or even of mixed type ( as for branch 1 ) .",
    "the resulting oscillatorily or exponentially unstable dynamics , respectively , led to the gain overwhelming the dynamics and leading to indefinite growth in the one or two of the gain peaks of our four - peak potential .",
    "naturally , there are numerous directions that merit additional investigation .",
    "for instance , and although this would be of less direct relevance in optics , partial @xmath0 symmetry could be extended to 3 dimensions . there",
    "it would be relevant to appreciate the differences between potentials that are partially @xmath0 symmetric in one direction vs. those partially @xmath0 symmetric in two directions .",
    "another relevant case to explore in the context of the present mode is that where a @xmath0 phase transition has already occurred through the collision of the second and third linear eigenmode considered herein . exploring the nonlinear modes and the associated stability in that case would be an interesting task in its own right .",
    "such studies are presently under consideration and will be reported in future publications .",
