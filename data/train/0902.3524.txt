    "feedback control is a powerful method of regulating spatio - temporal dynamics and has been studied in a wide variety of fields including physics , chemistry , biology , and medical science @xcite . for example ,",
    "formation of various clustering patterns has been realized in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite and in the catalytic co oxidation reaction on pt @xcite .",
    "the catalytic co oxidation systems have also been studied for the suppression of chemical turbulence @xcite . moreover ,",
    "considerable attention has been paid to feedback devices that suppress the pathological synchronization in the brain of parkinson s disease patients @xcite .    in many cases systems to be controlled are spatially extended , and reaction - diffusion systems provide a good model for the study of pattern controlling .",
    "theoretical analyses based on reaction - diffusion systems have been done for the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite and co oxidation @xcite .",
    "however , so far , only empirical control has been achieved for such spatially - extended systems , including above - mentioned pioneering experimental works @xcite ; there has been no general theory that _",
    "quantitatively _ relates feedback inputs to spatial patterns .    on the other hand , for discrete oscillator systems ,",
    "such a quantitative feedback control methodology has been established very recently by kiss , kori , hudson , and rusin @xcite .",
    "their method is based on a phase model described by @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the phase of the oscillator @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the natural frequency , @xmath6 is the coupling strength , and @xmath7 is called the coupling function .",
    "their method utilizes the following facts : the coupling function determines the entire collective behavior of the phase model , and any coupling function can be designed by applying an appropriately constructed feedback signal to a population of oscillators .",
    "hence the population of oscillators can be steered to a desired synchronization behavior by taking the following two steps : ( i ) find a coupling function that results in a desired synchronization behavior in ( 1 ) , and ( ii ) construct an appropriate feedback signal that yields the coupling function .",
    "a major advantage of their methodology is that the phase model can be constructed from experimentally measurable quantities only ; detailed information on the intrinsic dynamics of the system is not necessary .",
    "validity and robustness of their methodology have been confirmed both experimentally by using electro - chemical oscillators @xcite and numerically @xcite .    in this paper , by utilizing the above methodology by kiss , kori , hudson , and rusin , we develop a general theory for the global feedback control of spatially extended oscillatory media .",
    "our approach is also based on a phase model .",
    "since the existence of diffusive coupling plays a crucial role on the development of spatial patterns in oscillatory media , our phase model inevitably includes both diffusive and global coupling , in contrast to discrete oscillators .",
    "studying such a phase model , we find coupling functions leading to the following spatial patterns characterized by the distribution of phases : ( i ) 2-cluster states with specified population ratios , ( ii ) equally populated multi - cluster states , and ( iii ) a desynchronized state .",
    "moreover , we propose a new nonlinear feedback function without time delay , which is more convenient to design various coupling functions than that used in the previous work @xcite .",
    "we numerically demonstrate our proposed method by using a particular reaction - diffusion model and reproduce all the above three patterns with theoretically predicted feedback parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] , we present the basic idea of our control methodology for oscillatory media in detail . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we give a detailed analysis of the phase diffusion equation with special coupling functions that yield the above - mentioned three spatial patterns .",
    "numerical demonstration of the theory by using the brusselator is given in section [ sec : brusselator ] .",
    "experimental realization is discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our approach to the control of oscillatory media is closely related to the method recently proposed for the population of oscillators @xcite .",
    "dynamics of discrete , identical limit - cycle oscillators under global feedback is described by the following nonlinear dynamical equations : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the state vector of the @xmath10 oscillator ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is a nonlinear function describing a limit cycle oscillation , @xmath6 is the coupling strength , @xmath13 represents the feedback , and @xmath14 is a unit vector with only one nonzero component : we have assumed that the feedback is additively applied to the system .",
    "when the coupling is weak , by treating the second term as a small perturbation the system is reduced to the phase model ( [ eq : pm ] ) @xcite . in this phase description ( [ eq : pm ] ) , synchronization behavior depends solely on the coupling function @xmath7 , and therefore one can control the synchronization behavior of the system if the coupling function is freely given .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this can be done by applying a properly designed external feedback signal @xmath13 to the oscillators system .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the coupling function is the convolution of the feedback @xmath15 and the phase response function @xmath16 , which characterizes the sensitivity of the phase to a weak external perturbation ( see [ ap : derivation ] ) .",
    "since oscillatory media can be regarded as a population of oscillators that are diffusively connected , we argue that the same method works for shaping the coupling function in the phase description of oscillatory media . consider a @xmath17-dimensional reaction - diffusion system with a global coupling : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the state vector , @xmath20 denotes the diffusion matrix , @xmath21 is a reaction term that generates a limit cycle oscillation with the frequency @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the coupling strength , @xmath14 is the same as above , and @xmath22 represents the feedback integrated over the entire space @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the system is benjamin - feir stable , _",
    "i.e. _ , the system undergoes spatially uniform oscillation when @xmath24 ( external control is absent ) .",
    "following the standard procedure ( see [ ap : derivation ] ) , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the phase of local oscillation ; @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are constants determined by the property of the oscillatory medium . as in the case of discrete oscillators ,",
    "the coupling function @xmath7 can be arbitrarily shaped by properly designing the feedback signal @xmath15 .    for discrete oscillators ,",
    "@xmath29-cluster states can be generated from the coupling function that contains @xmath30 harmonics @xcite . even in the case of oscillatory media",
    ", the coupling function is expected to work in the same way to stabilize the clustering pattern . a distinct problem here , however , is that the spatial patterns are not solely determined from the global coupling but from the interplay between the diffusive coupling and the global coupling , which makes the analysis much more complicated .",
    "for example , when clustering pattern forms , interfaces appear between the clusters due to the diffusive coupling",
    ". then controlling of the interface motion is required to obtain desired clustering patterns .",
    "hence we take the following strategy .",
    "we start from a coupling function with which discrete oscillators described by equation ( [ eq : pm ] ) exhibit clustering or desynchronization .",
    "we then study the phase diffusion equation ( 4 ) with this coupling function to find resulting spatial patterns .",
    "once the relation between the pattern and the coupling function is obtained , the corresponding feedback function can be found by following the same procedure as the discrete oscillators case .",
    "the key to carrying out this strategy is to find proper couping functions that allows for analytical treatment of the phase equation .",
    "although analytical treatment is easy for a simple coupling function as @xmath31 with a parameter @xmath32 @xcite , only poor spatial patterns appear with such a coupling function ; higher harmonics in the coupling function are responsible for the formation of complex spatial patterns , including phase clustering behavior . in the next section we propose such analytically tractable coupling functions that produces clustering states and the desynchronized state .",
    "in this section , we study a one - dimensional phase diffusion equation with a global coupling ( [ eq : phase ] ) . here",
    "we propose coupling functions that yield interesting spatial patterns ; we are especially interested in two cluster states with specified population ratios , equally populated multi - cluster states , and the desynchronized state .      here",
    "we focus on the 2-cluster states with an arbitrary population ratio .",
    "in particular , we look for well - defined 2-clusters , with the phases maximally separated by @xmath33 .",
    "discrete oscillators are known to form various clustering states , the behavior entirely governed by the form of the coupling function @xcite . in special ,",
    "the following coupling function yields 2-cluster states with the two phase difference equal to @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath32 are parameters ( see [ ap:2cl ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pm ] ) with this coupling function has a family of 2-cluster solution with different population ratios of the two clusters , which are stable for some range of population ratios .",
    "thus , starting from a random initial condition the system converges to a 2-cluster state with its population ratio determined from the initial condition .    using this coupling function",
    ", we numerically investigate the phase diffusion equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) in one dimension with the system size @xmath36 , taking @xmath32 as a control parameter and @xmath37 .",
    "this equation is solved with the flux - free boundary condition by using the second - order euler scheme , with spatial and time interval being set to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we assign several values to @xmath28 to make a phase diagram below .",
    "otherwise we set @xmath43 .",
    "this special choice of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is for later comparison to the brusselator model .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase ] shows the phase diagram obtained by varying @xmath32 for each @xmath44 with several values of @xmath28 and fixed @xmath27 .",
    "as expected , there exists a finite range of stationary 2-cluster states .",
    "note that , as opposed to discrete oscillators , here the population ratio between the two clusters is uniquely determined for fixed @xmath45 and @xmath32 .",
    "increase ( decrease ) in @xmath32 widens the phase - advanced ( retarded ) region . at some critical value of @xmath32",
    "the stationary state becomes unstable , leading to the _ recurrent _",
    "2-cluster state , where the following process occurs in a repeated way [ see figure  [ fig : spacetime](a ) ] : after a long transient of a quasi - stationary 2-cluster state , a new cluster sprouts out of the phase - advanced ( retarded ) cluster .",
    "then the two interfaces propagate and one of the clusters disappear , the system returning to the 2-cluster state .",
    "such dynamics have been reported in co oxidation model@xcite , although investigated only numerically .    to characterize the patterns",
    ", we introduce the @xmath46 order parameters ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 for 2-cluster states , @xmath49 indicates an approximate population disparity between the two clusters , and @xmath50 the ratio of the interface width to the system size @xmath51 .",
    "note the two different timescales in figure  [ fig : spacetime](b ) , each corresponding to the emergence of a new cluster and a slow drift of the interface .",
    "as @xmath32 exceeds the threshold around @xmath52 , the recurrent 2-clusters turn into the desynchronized state [ figure  [ fig : phase](c ) ] , where @xmath53 almost vanishes .",
    "here we analytically investigate the 2-cluster states numerically found above .",
    "the analysis can be done by taking @xmath54 limit .",
    "we derive analytical forms of @xmath55 and @xmath53 as functions of @xmath32 and give the stability boundaries of the stationary 2-cluster shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "we move to a co - rotating frame so that the phase of the phase - retarded cluster is fixed to @xmath56 .",
    "as we can see from the numerical result , the profile of a 2-cluster state can be decomposed into three regions : the phase - retarded cluster denoted by @xmath57 ( @xmath56 ) , the phase - advanced cluster denoted by @xmath58 , and the interface .",
    "also , from the numerical observation it is implied that the instability leading to the _ recurrent _",
    "2-clusters appears from the clustered region , while the interface remains stable .",
    "hence in the analysis below we assume that the interface does not contribute to the stability .",
    "this separation of the regions becomes well - defined for large @xmath51 .",
    "when the interface width is negligible compared to the system size , the two order parameters become real . in particular , in the steady state , we have @xmath59 , so that @xmath55 is the only relevant order parameter .",
    "consider the dynamics of the cluster @xmath57 .",
    "contribution of the interface comes from the global coupling represented as the integral in equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) . since the interface width is vanishingly small",
    ", the interface region itself does not affect the dynamics .",
    "the remaining effect of the interface comes indirectly through the interface motion that varies the population ratio of the two clusters .",
    "however , since the timescale of the interface motion is @xmath60 , as shown below , the population ratio can be treated as constant .",
    "thus in this limit the dynamics of the clusters is independent of the interface motion .",
    "when the interface can be negligible , equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) has a solution @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where the population ratio is arbitrarily given .",
    "the stability analysis can be performed in the same way as the discrete oscillators ( see [ ap:2cl ] ) .",
    "the only difference is the contribution from the diffusive coupling , which turns out to be negligible in the large @xmath51 limit .",
    "two modes of fluctuation occurs in the 2-cluster state : inter - cluster and intra - cluster fluctuation .",
    "inter - cluster mode is a fluctuation of the phase between the clusters , with each cluster oscillating uniformly .",
    "the eigenvalue associated with this mode is given by @xmath65 .",
    "thus by choosing @xmath66 we can keep this mode stable . on the other hand , intra - cluster mode ,",
    "a fluctuation within a cluster can be unstable .",
    "the eigenvalues associated with the cluster @xmath57 and @xmath58 with the wavenumber @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , where @xmath70 , the population ratio , is the area fraction of the cluster @xmath57 and is related to @xmath55 through @xmath71 .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath72-terms implies that the diffusion always works as stabilizing the @xmath73-cluster modes ; the most unstable mode is the one with the smallest ( but finite ) wavenumber . taking the large @xmath51 limit",
    ", this smallest wavenumber is vanishingly small , so that the @xmath72-terms can be dropped from the expression of the eigenvalue .",
    "thus the diffusion does not affect the stability , while the stability depends on the population ratio . to obtain the analytical expression of the population ratio ,",
    "let us consider the interface dynamics .",
    "the two clusters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are treated as the fixed boundaries of the interface .",
    "since the inter - cluster mode is stable , the boundary conditions of the interface profile are given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath53 is replaced by the steady - state value , @xmath59",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) becomes @xmath76 where we have defined @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and rescaled time and space as @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( a ) space - time plot of a recurrent 2-cluster for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath81 .",
    "gray levels represent the spatial derivative of @xmath82 , with the black lines indicating the location of the interfaces .",

    "( c)-(f ) snapshots of the phase profile , each corresponding to the arrows in ( b ) . , width=491 ]    suppose that there is a traveling solution @xmath83 , where the interface velocity @xmath84 is written as @xmath85 , owing to the fact that interface motion varies the population ratio .",
    "multiplying ( [ eq : phase2 ] ) by @xmath86 and integrating over the entire space yields @xmath87 therefore @xmath88 has a stable solution formally written as @xmath89 from ( [ eq : dsigmadt ] ) it is seen that the interface slowly moves with the timescale of @xmath60 toward this stable state .",
    "thus the interface dynamics , or the time evolution of @xmath88 , is decoupled from the rest .",
    "an explicit expression of the steady state solution of @xmath88 can be obtained through perturbation expansion .",
    "first we seek for a stationary solution of ( [ eq : phase2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath32 satisfies @xmath90 , there exists an exact solution connecting @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "it is easily verified from ( [ eq : sig_stationary ] ) that this solution satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "then perturbation expansion can be performed in terms of @xmath88 up to the first order .",
    "we obtain ( see [ ap : sigma ] ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "substituting the expression of @xmath88 into the intra - cluster eigenvalues , we obtain the stability condition of 2-cluster states . in the large @xmath51 limit",
    ", the @xmath72-term in the eigenvalues vanishes and the stability boundary is given by @xmath96 figure  [ fig : sgm ] shows the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath32 .",
    "we have plotted only the real part of @xmath88 , while in our simulation the imaginary part is @xmath97 and is negligible . both equations ( [ eq : sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : st_cond ] ) fit well with the numerical data . moreover , substituting ( [ eq : sigma ] ) into ( [ eq : st_cond ] ) yields @xmath98 which gives the threshold value of @xmath32 for the stability of stationary 2-cluster states .",
    "note that the stability condition is independent of @xmath35 .",
    "the theoretical lines given by ( [ eq : pd_cond ] ) are in excellent agreement with numerical data in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "thus , within the range of parameter @xmath32 determined from ( [ eq : pd_cond ] ) , we can control @xmath88 as a function of @xmath32 via ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "( a)relation between the real part of @xmath88 and @xmath32 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the open circles are numerical data ; the dotted lines represent the boundary of the existence of stationary 2-cluster states , given by ( [ eq : st_cond ] ) ; the solid line is given by ( [ eq : sigma ] ) ; crosses at @xmath99 and @xmath100 are numerical data from the brusselator model with corresponding parameters .",
    "( b ) relation between critical values of @xmath88 and @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the filled and open circles correspond to the instabilities of phase - advanced and phase - retarded clusters , respectively , with different values of @xmath28 .",
    "the dotted line is ( [ eq : st_cond ] ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    now the interpretation of the recurrent 2-cluster states are given as follows : given an initial condition , the system converges to a 2-cluster state with a slowly - moving interface .",
    "when @xmath88 , varies through the interface motion , exceeds the threshold given by equation ( [ eq : st_cond ] ) , the intra - cluster mode becomes unstable and one of the clusters collapses .",
    "since the inter - cluster mode remains stable , the system returns to a 2-cluster state with reduced @xmath88 , the whole process repeated _ ad infinitum_.      we give a theoretical analysis of equation ( [ eq : phase2 ] ) for the desynchronized state .",
    "the perfect desynchronized state is defined such that all the order parameters vanish . however , in practice some order parameters remain finite because of the boundary effect for flux - free boundary conditions .",
    "firstly , as an ideal case , let us assume the periodic boundary condition .",
    "then the perfect desynchronized state can be given by @xmath103 .",
    "linear stability analysis for this profile shows that for each mode with the wavenumber @xmath104 @xmath105 the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "hence the @xmath110 mode loses the stability at @xmath111 in the large @xmath51 limit , which fits well with numerical data in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "note that , if the diffusive coupling is absent , only @xmath112 and @xmath110 modes are stable , @xmath113 modes being neutral .",
    "since the boundary is not periodic but flux - free in the present case , the profile deviates from the linear one , as shown in figure  [ fig : phase](c ) , accordingly , the steady state values of @xmath114 are shifted from zero by @xmath60 ( order of the width of the boundaries ) .",
    "note that in the linear regime the main contribution to @xmath114 comes from the mode @xmath115 .",
    "the modes @xmath112 and @xmath110 have the eigenvalues of order @xmath116 as seen above , and thus @xmath55 and @xmath53 remains to be @xmath60 . on the other hand , since @xmath113 modes have the eigenvalues of @xmath117 , nonlinear effects of order @xmath117 coming from the terms such as @xmath118 makes @xmath113 modes grow up to @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , in order to get better desynchronized state , we need to add as many higher harmonics as possible , as demonstrated in section [ sec : brusselator ] .      the arguments of 2-cluster states can be extended to @xmath29-clusters in the following way .",
    "consider the following coupling function : @xmath119 this coupling function , when introduced to discrete oscillators , creates stable equally - populated @xmath29-clusters with the phases evenly separated ( [ ap:2cl ] ) .",
    "let us find a stationary , equally populated @xmath29-cluster solution of ( [ eq : phase ] ) with ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "such a solution satisfies @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 , and hence only @xmath30 harmonic remains in ( [ eq : phase ] ) .",
    "then , by choosing @xmath32 so as to satisfy @xmath123 we have a solution with each cluster separated by @xmath124 and all the @xmath125 interfaces having the same interface profile given by @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "this state is stable against _",
    "inter- _ and _ intra-_cluster fluctuations ( see [ ap:2cl ] ) .    for the stability of the desynchronized state , the same argument as in the above @xmath128 case holds and the stability boundary is given by @xmath129 .",

    "this implies that the system size should be large enough to obtain well - defined cluster states even under weak feedback : the width of the interface is @xmath175 , which must be sufficiently smaller than the linear dimension @xmath51 . also , to make a coupling function containing large enough higher harmonics with weak feedback ,",
    "oscillation is better to be relaxation type : then the response function has higher harmonics with large amplitudes , so that we can keep the feedback signal weak to realize a desired coupling function [ see the expression of @xmath7 ( [ eq : gam_four ] ) ] .",
    "second , the emergence of phase singularity leads to the breakdown of the phase description and must be avoided .",
    "we have checked in our preliminary numerical simulations that the multi - cluster states and the desynchronized state are robust against noise .",
    "thus we are convinced that our proposed method works in experimental systems .",
    "we have proposed a theoretical framework for designing spatial patterns in oscillatory media .",
    "when a certain pattern is found in a phase model with a specific coupling function , the same pattern can be realized in oscillatory media by applying a properly constructed nonlinear feedback . in this paper , we found analytically tractable coupling functions that enables us to quantitatively control the spatial patterns . using these coupling functions",
    ", we investigated the phase equation with the global coupling and found the parameter regions where the following patterns stably exist : 2-cluster states with specified population ratios , equally populated multi - cluster states , and the desynchronized state . in the case of 2-clusters",
    ", we gave analytical expression of the population ratio of the two clusters as the function of a feedback parameter .",
    "we also proposed a simple form of the nonlinear feedback function to make the calculation of the feedback parameters easier .",
    "we exemplified all these results using the brusselator model and succeeded to reproduce the patterns predicted by the phase model .",
    "since our method is based on the measurable quantities only , it is expected that the method is verified in a real experiment .",
    "the desynchronized state deserves further remark .",
    "our results show that even in oscillatory media one can drive the system into the desynchronized state , as well as in discrete oscillators @xcite .",
    "such a control is not only of medical @xcite , but also potentially of industrial interest ; for example , it would be beneficial when constant output from oscillatory catalytic reaction is desirable .",
    "further investigation of the phase model with other coupling functions is of great interest for controlling more complex patterns , although our method is limited to oscillatory system and can not be applied to some typical spatial patterns such as the turing pattern . also , investigating the control of benjamin - feir unstable systems by replacing the phase diffusion equation with kuramoto - sivashinsky equation will be interesting both in a theoretical sense and for application .",
    "the authors are grateful to y. nishiura and a.  s. mikhailov for valuable discussions .",
    "in this appendix we derive the phase model ( [ eq : phase ] ) from a reaction - diffusion system with a global feedback .",
    "the system is assumed to undergo spatially uniform oscillation when external control is absent ( namely , the system is benjamin - feir stable @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical evolution of a @xmath17-dimensional oscillatory medium is described by a reaction - diffusion equation : @xmath176 note that here we consider a general situation , where the global feedback is introduced through a global parameter @xmath177 . in equation ( [ eq : rd ] ) , and in references",
    "@xcite , the feedback is simply applied additively .",
    "external feedback is applied to @xmath177 as @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 are constants . by assumption",
    ", @xmath181 yields a limit - cycle oscillation , with its solution denoted by @xmath182 .",
    "the function @xmath183 describes a global feedback signal , given by @xmath184 where @xmath22 is some feedback function .",
    "the integration is taken over the entire space and @xmath23 is the volume of the system .",
    "( various functions can be considered for @xmath15 .",
    "our particular choice has been given in equation [ eq : h ] . )    as we have assumed , feedback intensity @xmath6 is small , so that by dropping @xmath185 equation ( [ eq : rd_original ] ) can be approximated by @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "when @xmath188 is independent of @xmath189 , the global parameter @xmath177 appears additively and the system reduces to equation ( [ eq : rd ] ) .",
    "when a spatial pattern emerges for small @xmath180 , the spatial variation , and thus @xmath190 , is expected to be small , vanishing as @xmath191 .",
    "thus , in addition to the feedback term , we may treat the diffusion term as small perturbations to the limit cycle ( this is the case in our simulation , where the interface width is @xmath175 ) , and therefore the diffusion term is the same order as the feedback ) .",
    "then , following a standard method developed by kuramoto @xcite , we can derive a closed description for the phase variable for our oscillatory medium . as is usually adopted , the phase @xmath192 is defined so as to satisfy @xmath193 . substituting this relation into the identity @xmath194",
    ", we obtain @xmath195 at the lowest order of @xmath6 , we can replace @xmath189 with the value on the limit cycle @xmath196 .",
    "then the equation above is expressed only in terms of @xmath82 . after averaging ( [ eq : phi_nonav ] )",
    "over one period of oscillation , we arrive at equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath7 are written as @xmath197 here , the phase response function @xmath198 , defined as the response to the global parameter @xmath177 , and the `` bare '' response function @xmath199 , are evaluated on the unperturbed limit - cycle orbit .",
    "expanding @xmath16 and @xmath146 as @xmath200 and @xmath201 respectively , we obtain @xmath202 hence the coupling function containing up to the @xmath203 harmonics can be generated by determining @xmath146 up to the @xmath203 harmonics , as long as @xmath149 has a finite value@xcite .",
    "here we show that the collection of discrete oscillators interacting through the coupling function given by ( [ eq : couple2 ] ) can exhibit 2-cluster states with their phases separated by @xmath33 .",
    "consider a set of @xmath204 identical oscillators with the frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics is written as @xmath205 to produce @xmath29-cluster states , it is sufficient that the coupling function contains up to the @xmath30 harmonics @xcite ; linear stability analysis shows that the harmonics smaller than n does not contribute to the stability of @xmath29-cluster states , and the @xmath30 harmonics works in a similar way to @xmath29:1 periodic forcing @xcite . in special , to observe 2-cluster states , one needs to prepare the coupling function such that the first harmonics destabilizes the 1-cluster , _ i.e. _ , perfect synchronization , and the second assures the 2-cluster .",
    "thus the coupling function for 2-cluster states can be written as @xmath206 the amplitude of the first harmonics can be absorbed into the coupling constant @xmath6 . also , for later convenience we choose the negative sign for the second harmonics .",
    "assume that the oscillators form a 2-cluster state , where @xmath207 oscillators belong to the cluster @xmath57 with the phase @xmath208 and @xmath209 to the cluster @xmath58 with @xmath210 .",
    "in the phase - locking state ( @xmath211 for all @xmath3 ) , we get @xmath212 where @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the frequency of the clusters",
    ". then @xmath216 satisfies @xmath217 when we choose @xmath218 , ( [ eq : app_psi ] ) has a solution @xmath219 for any @xmath70 . in special ,",
    "when @xmath66 , @xmath219 is the only solution except for @xmath220 , the single cluster solution . if @xmath221 , the phase difference is shifted from @xmath33 except for @xmath222 .",
    "we perform the linear stability analysis by expanding @xmath223 as @xmath224 , where @xmath225 for @xmath226 and @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",
    "first we consider the _",
    "inter_-cluster mode , where the fluctuation is uniform in each cluster . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the mode @xmath231 obeys @xmath232 changing the variables as @xmath233 , and using @xmath234 , we obtain @xmath235 the zero mode @xmath236 represents uniform rotation along with the limit cycle . on the other hand , @xmath237 corresponds to the inter - cluster mode , which is stable regardless of @xmath32 for @xmath66 .",
    "next we consider the _",
    "intra_-cluster mode , where the fluctuation occurs within each cluster and the spatial average of @xmath238 within each cluster is zero .",
    "we get @xmath239 thus the intra - cluster fluctuation the eigenvalues @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "these modes can be destabilized depending on the population ratio @xmath70 . in special , when @xmath242 , either @xmath243 or @xmath244 is positive for any @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , the coupling function ( [ eq : gamma ] ) produces @xmath29-cluster solutions @xmath245 ( @xmath246 ) for arbitrary population ratio , as can be checked by direct substitution .",
    "stability is studied analogously with the @xmath128 case above , the _",
    "intra_- and _",
    "inter_-cluster eigenvalues given by @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the fraction of the @xmath249 cluster . when the clusters are equally populated , @xmath250 and is stable for @xmath251 .",
    "conversely , when @xmath242 at least one of @xmath29 clusters has positive @xmath252 and the @xmath29-cluster state is no longer stable .",
    "we expand the parameter @xmath32 and the profile @xmath253 in terms of @xmath88 as follows : @xmath254 substituting these expressions into ( [ eq : phase2 ] ) yields the following linearized equation : @xmath255 where the linearized operator @xmath256 is given by @xmath257 the adjoint operator @xmath258 is written as @xmath259    it is verified by direct calculation that @xmath258 has the zero eigenfunction @xmath260\\mathrm{sech}\\kappa x$ ] .",
