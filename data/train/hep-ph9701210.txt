    "heavy quarkonia have been playing an important role over the past decades in the development of the theory of the strong interaction and such beneficial influence seems far from ending .",
    "indeed , the experimental discovery at fermilab @xcite of an excess of inclusive production of prompt heavy quarkonia ( mainly for @xmath0 and @xmath2 resonances ) in antiproton - proton collisions triggered an intense theoretical activity beyond what was considered conventional wisdom until recently @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the so - called colour - singlet model ( csm ) in hadroproduction @xcite and the experimental data amounts to more than an order of magnitude and can not be attributed to those theoretical uncertainties arising from the ambiguities on the choice of a particular parton distribution function ( pdf ) , the heavy quark mass or different energy scales .",
    "recently it has been argued that the surplus of charmonia production can be accounted for by assuming that the heavy quark pair not necessarily has to be produced in a colour - singlet state at the short - distance partonic process itself @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be produced in a colour - octet state evolving non - perturbatively into quarkonium in a specific final state with the correct quantum numbers according to some computable probabilities governed by the internal velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "this mechanism , usually named as the colour - octet model ( com ) , can be cast into the rigorous framework of an effective non - relativistic theory for the strong interactions ( nrqcd ) deriving from first principles @xcite .",
    "however , the weakness of the com lies in the fact that the non - perturbative parameters characterizing the long - distance hadronization process beyond the colour - singlet contribution ( i.e. the colour - octet matrix elements ) are so far almost free parameters to be adjusted from the fit to experimental data , though expected to be mutually consistent according to the nrqcd power counting rules .",
    "on the other hand , an attractive feature of the colour - octet hypothesis consists of the universality of the nrqcd matrix elements entering in other charmonium production processes like photoproduction from electron - proton collisions at hera @xcite .",
    "let us look below in some detail at the way hadronization is folded with the partonic description of hadrons , focusing for concreteness on the couple of related papers @xcite .    in the first paper @xcite , cho and leibovich considered for charmonium production ( in addition to the csm ) the @xmath3 coloured intermediate state as a first approach , computing the squared amplitudes as products of perturbative parts standing for the short - distance partonic processes , and the colour - octet matrix element concerning the long - distance hadronization .",
    "finally , a convolution of concrete parton distribution functions and the differential cross - section for the @xmath4 production subprocess was performed , whereby the @xmath1 dependence of the charmonia production exclusively coming from the latter .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same authors take into account further contributions from new coloured states ( for more details see the quoted references ) concluding finally that at high enough @xmath1 a two - parameter fit is actually required to explain the observed inclusive @xmath1 distribution of charmonia production at the tevatron .",
    "notice , however , that such calculations were carried out based on a possibly oversimplified picture of the hadronic interaction . indeed , it is already well - known a long time ago that higher - order qcd effects ( @xmath5 factors ) play an important role in inclusive hadroproduction . in particular , beyond the primordial transverse momentum @xmath6 of partons in hadrons due to fermi motion relevant at small @xmath1 , initial - state radiation of gluons by the interacting partons add up yielding an _ effective _ intrinsic transverse momentum which certainly has to be considered in hadroproduction at high @xmath1 @xcite . as we shall see ,",
    "if overlooked at all in charmonia production , the specific effect on the fit parameters ( and ultimately on the colour - octet matrix elements ) amounts to a _",
    "systematic _ overestimate .",
    "in this work we have implemented the colour - octet mechanism in the event generator pythia 5.7 @xcite via the following @xmath7 partonic processes : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , s via the csm @xcite . in an earlier work @xcite we considered only the gluon - gluon fusion but with the colour mechanism implemented in ] including the @xmath3 and @xmath11 contributions as coloured intermediate states .",
    "the corresponding differential cross sections can be found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude from our simulation that gluon - gluon fusion actually stands for the dominant process as expected , gluon - quark scattering contributes appreciably , whereas quark - antiquark scattering represents a tiny contribution .",
    "let us stress that initial- and final - state radiation were incorporated within the lund monte carlo framework @xcite .",
    "of course , the pythia treatment of the effective @xmath6 is not guaranteed to be perfect but , nevertheless , should give a reasonable estimate of such effects .    using the same numerical values for the colour - octet matrix elements as reported in tables i and ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , if initial- and final - state radiation are turned off ( there exists this possibility in pythia @xcite ) , there is a good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental points ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , as should be reasonably expected .",
    "however , if initial- and final - state radiation spectrum , the former enhancing the high @xmath1 tail whereas the latter softens the distribution ] are switched on , the predicted curve stands well above the experimental data over the @xmath1 range examined , in accordance with the expected @xmath12kick \" caused by the _ effective _ primordial transverse momentum of partons @xcite .",
    "accordingly , keeping radiation effects on in the modelling of the full hadronic production process , it turns out that the values of the colour - octet matrix elements have to be lowered by significant factors .    in order to assess the impact of the effective intrinsic @xmath6 upon the nrqcd matrix elements we have made three different choices for the proton pdf :    a ) : :    the leading order cteq 2l ( by default in pythia 5.7 ) b ) : :    the next to leading order mrsd0 ( the same as used in @xcite ) c ) : :    the next to leading order grv 94 ho    as already mentioned before",
    ", the theoretical curve of the inclusive @xmath1 distribution of prompt @xmath0 s stands in all cases above tevatron experimental points if the set of parameters from @xcite are blindly employed in the pythia generation with initial - state radiation on .",
    "motivated by this systematic discrepancy , we performed new fits for the prompt @xmath0 direct production at tevatron ( feed - down from radiative decay of @xmath13 resonances was experimentally removed ) .",
    "the corresponding colour - octet matrix elements are shown in table 1 and the plots for cases a ) and b ) in fig .",
    "2 . we found @xmath14 and @xmath15 for a ) , b ) and c ) respectively .",
    "notice that our new results for the matrix elements are in general slightly smaller than those presented in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that we are including new contributions not considered before so that the fit parameters have to be further lowered accordingly .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "finally , we have generated prompt @xmath0 s in proton - proton collisions at lhc energies ( center - of - mass energy = 14 tev ) by means of our @xmath12modified \" version of pythia with the colour - octet matrix elements as shown in table 1 - i.e. after normalization to tevatron data .",
    "indeed , an order - of - magnitude estimate for the expected production of charmonia at the lhc is suitable from many points of views @xcite : @xmath0 can be considered either as a signal in its own right or as a source of background for other interesting processes involving @xmath0 s , like cp studies from the cascade channel @xmath16 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show altogether the @xmath1 inclusive distributions of direct prompt @xmath0 s at the lhc obtained for the three pdf s employed in our study . comparing them with the distribution obtained by sridhar @xcite , we find our predictions standing below his theoretical curve at large @xmath1 .",
    "in fact this is not surprising since sridhar considered only the @xmath3 coloured intermediate state , whose nrqcd matrix element was taken larger than the one used in this work .",
    "the argument ends by noticing that at high enough @xmath1 the dominant production comes from the @xmath3 contribution as the combined @xmath11 contribution falls off faster .",
    "in this paper we have extended our preliminary study @xcite considering all three possible short - distance processes , namely @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , contributing at order @xmath7 to charmonia production including the colour - octet mechanism .",
    "we have investigated higher - order effects induced by initial - state radiation on the extraction of the nrqcd matrix elements from hadroproduction at high @xmath1 by means of an event generator ( pythia 5.7 ) with colour - octet mechanisms implemented in .",
    "we conclude that the overlooking of the _ effective _ primordial @xmath6 leads systematically to a significant overestimate of the colour parameters .",
    "we have re - calculated those colour - octet matrix elements for @xmath0 production from fits to tevatron data using three different sets of proton pdf s .",
    "finally we have estimated the prompt @xmath0 production at the lhc , finding an overall relative good accordance among the three choices for the proton pdf . under the assumption of the validity of the com , our prediction can be used for simulation purposes at lhc experiments ( see the web page at http://wwwcn.cern.ch/@xmath17msmizans/ production/0.html for a general view of the b physics simulation status in atlas ) .",
