    "the correspondence between zeros of polynomials and models of physical systems has a very long history which goes back to early works of stieltjes @xcite , heine @xcite , bcher @xcite , van vleck @xcite and polya @xcite at the end of the 19th century in relation to electrostatic models .",
    "a concise summary can be found in @xcite .",
    "the subject of zeros of polynomials @xcite , and specifically the sum rules of their zeros , was systematically studied for hermite , laguerre , tchebycheff , jacobi and lam polynomials @xcite .",
    "the study of the generalised lam equation ( a second order fuchsian equation ) , its heine - stieltjes and van vleck polynomials , and their zeros , is still a very active area of research @xcite .",
    "the relation between ordinary differential equations and integrable systems has been observed by several authors @xcite and in particular connection to a generalised stieltjes problem has been discussed @xcite .",
    "richardson s bethe ansatz solution @xcite for the @xmath0-wave pairing bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) hamiltonian has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the richardson s equations and the confluent heun differential equation was recognised by gaudin @xcite . numerical methods to solve richardson s equations for finite number of particles were implemented later @xcite . here",
    "there may be convergence problems concerning critical points where the solution set of roots contains degeneracies @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods of @xcite rely on a direct approach , or use an appropriate change of variables for the critical points , to solve the bethe ansatz equations .    with regard to the difficulty of directly solving the bethe ansatz equations , very recently new numerical approaches based on the bethe ansatz / ordinary differential equation ( ba / ode ) correspondence were proposed @xcite .",
    "they are based on linear second - order differential equations @xcite , or their corresponding riccati equations @xcite which are first - order nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the polynomials obtained by these methods correspond to extended heine - stieltjes polynomials @xcite .",
    "many advantages of these approaches were discussed in these works and it appears that such methods could be beneficial for studying integrable systems at their critical points .",
    "however , the applications of these new methods were limited to a certain class of bethe ansatz equations that contained the richardson solution and the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model .    in recent years",
    ", many papers have appeared devoted to finding new examples of bcs systems solvable by the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the richardson solution for @xmath0-wave pairing , several of these newer systems exhibit quantum phase transitions which can be identified by a change in the character of the bethe roots as a coupling constant is varied .",
    "such behaviour has also recently been observed in a different context of bosonic models @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a first step towards extending the application of numerical methods based on the ba / ode correspondence to these more recent bcs systems .",
    "in particular we will conduct an analysis for the degenerate two - level limit .",
    "the bcs hamiltonians we consider below are generally expressed in terms of fermions .",
    "given the blocking effect @xcite of the pairing interaction , for simplicity we hereafter only consider for all models the subspace of unblocked states .",
    "this effectively reduces the dimension of the hilbert space of states for the model . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to write the hamiltonians only in term of hard - core boson operators .",
    "the hard - core boson operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( cooper pair creation and annihilation operators ) satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath5=\\delta_{jk}(1 - 2n_j),\\quad [ b_{j},b_{k}]=[b_{j}^{\\dagger},b_{k}^{\\dagger}]=0 \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 . furthermore by considering a degenerate , two - level limit of these models we further effectively reduce the dimensionality of the hilbert space by only considering certain `` unblocked symmetric states '' which will be defined later .",
    "one motivation for us to do this is that we want to illustrate that the numerical methods employed here provide solutions of the bethe ansatz equations for excited states as well as the ground state . in order to display this data in a transparent manner ,",
    "it is an advantage to restrict our analysis to a subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "if the ground state on the unrestricted hilbert space is non - degenerate , symmetry arguments lead to the conclusion that the ground state is an unblocked symmetric state . finally , we mention that the method employed here ( and in @xcite ) is distinct from other approaches @xcite in that we do not track solutions of the bethe ansatz equations from the zero coupling limit . in this respect issues surrounding critical points are avoided",
    ".    in section 2 we will introduce a class of nonlinear algebraic equations and obtain the corresponding ordinary differential equations involving only polynomials .",
    "we classify the different cases and discuss the application to two - level models . in section 3 , we discuss an algorithm to numerically generate the corresponding generalised heine - stieltjes and van vleck polynomials .",
    "we apply this approach to four systems : the richardson @xmath0-wave model @xcite , the @xmath1-wave pairing model @xcite , the @xmath1-wave pairing model coupled to a bosonic molecular pair degree of freedom @xcite , and a new solution for a @xmath2-wave pairing model with additional interactions @xcite .",
    "we will compare the ground - state roots obtained by this numerical method with the theoretical curve for an arc obtained in the continuum limit by a singular integral equation . in two cases",
    "we observe a phenomenum whereby all the ground - state roots collapse at the origin at a particular value of the coupling parameter .",
    "the method also allows us to obtain the roots for the excited states , which is important for studies of the dynamics analogous to those in @xcite .",
    "the systems studied previously using the polynomial approach @xcite belong to the class of coupled nonlinear algebraic ( bethe ansatz ) equations of the form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real parameters . the parameters @xmath9 can be interpreted in the context of bcs systems as single particle energy levels , @xmath10 is the number of levels and @xmath11 is the total number of cooper pairs .",

    "we will study degenerate two - level models , where each of the distinct levels @xmath59 and @xmath60 have have degeneracy @xmath61 . however",
    "the method can be applied to general @xmath10-level models at the cost of much more involved numerical calculations . for our study",
    "the problem becomes mathematically equivalent to taking @xmath62 @xmath23 for the first term of eq .",

    "an effect of restricting to the unbloacked symmetric states of the degenerate , two - level models which are governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is that the order of the polynomials @xmath81 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 is fixed as we change the value of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "once the @xmath84 and @xmath67 are obtained , each solution corresponding to solution set of bethe roots , the next step is to compute the roots from the generalised heine - stieltjes polynomials .",
    "this can be done in principle using one of the many well - known methods implemented in available softwares , and for an arbitrary order .",
    "but in practice this is a more complicated issue .",
    "a difficulty that appears is that these generalised heine - stieltjes polynomials will be polynomials of order @xmath11 and care is needed as it is known that numerical methods to find roots of polynomials can have instabilities @xcite .",
    "this problem can even affect the structure of the roots ( i.e. real vs. complex conjugate pairs ) .",
    "we will adopt in this paper an approach based on monomial expansion but we will take care of using a sufficient working precision . we will show that the method appears to be reliable and robust .",
