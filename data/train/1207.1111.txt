    "we establish a connection between three topics that involve the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum shannon theory .",
    "these are generalized kochen - specker sets , entanglement - assisted zero - error capacities , and graph coloring games .",
    "the ( bell-)kochen - specker theorem @xcite is one of the most striking results in quantum mechanics .",
    "informally , it states that it is not possible for all quantum mechanical observables to have definite values that are also noncontextual ( i.e. , independent of the measurement arrangement ) .",
    "one way to prove the theorem is by exhibiting a set of vectors for which there is no function that singles out exactly one vector for each orthonormal basis in the set .",
    "such collections are called _ kochen - specker _ ( ks ) _ sets _ ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "recently a relaxation of ks sets has been used to construct classical channels with quantum advantage @xcite .",
    "consider two parties that wish to use a noisy classical channel to transfer information with zero probability of error .",
    "for some channels quantum players using shared entanglement can outperform their classical counterparts .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown that entanglement can increase both the one - shot @xcite and asymptotic @xcite zero - error capacity .",
    "the entanglement - assisted zero - error capacity is the quantum analogue of shannon zero - error capacity , a well - studied concept in classical information theory .",
    "the entanglement - assisted zero - error capacity is known to be upper bounded by the lovsz theta number @xcite , which can be computed efficiently .",
    "a relaxation of ks sets has also been shown to characterize a certain class of _ pseudo - telepathy games _ @xcite .",
    "these are nonlocal games that can be won with certainty by quantum players using shared entanglement , while all classical players fail with nonzero probability .",
    "a specific class of pseudo - telepathy games is based on graph coloring . here",
    ", the advantage of entangled players is quantified by the so - called _ quantum chromatic number_. the quantum chromatic number can also be interpreted combinatorially via a vertex labeling problem using tuples of projectors satisfying certain completeness and orthogonality constraints @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the computational complexity of the quantum chromatic number is unknown .",
    "the present work relates the above notions .",
    "it gives a description of different phenomena with the same mathematical toolbox , with potential applications in zero - error information theory such as nonclassical communication protocols @xcite , quantum analogues of information - hiding methods ( _ e.g. _ , watermarking @xcite ) , and novel proof techniques for combinatorial problems either in optimization or in extremal set theory @xcite .",
    "we introduce two generalizations of kochen - specker sets : _ projective ks sets _ , consisting of projectors , and _",
    "generalized ks sets _ , consisting of positive - semidefinite operators .",
    "we show that projective ks sets are useful in a number of ways :    1 .   in section [ sec : zec2 ]",
    ", we show how to use projective ks sets to construct classical channels for which entaglement assistance increases their one - shot zero - error capacity .",
    "this generalizes a similar construction for ks sets given in @xcite .",
    "2 .   in section [ sec : qcn2 ] , we show that projective ks sets completely characterize the graphs exhibiting a separation between chromatic number and quantum chromatic number .",
    "the characterization settles the grap - theoretic discussion started in @xcite ; a characterization for the rank-1 case was already proposed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite observed a separation between rank-1 and general rank quantum chromatic number .",
    "hence , the use of projective ks sets is indeed necessary for a full characterization .",
    "3 .   in section",
    "[ sec : qcn_zec ] , we show how to use graphs for which the chromatic and quantum chromatic number are different to construct classical channels with a separation between entanglement - assisted and classical one - shot zero - error capacity .",
    "this answers an open question formulated in @xcite .",
    "graphs with such separations are useful for quantifying the information - theoretic gain permitted by the use of shared entanglement .",
    "4 .   in appendix",
    "[ apx : pt ] , we show that there is a correspondence between projective ks sets and pseudo - telepathy games that can be won by quantum players using only projective measurements on maximally entangled state .",

    "the second bound follows directly from lemma [ lem : vizing ] .",
    "note that the second upper bound of theorem [ thm : qcn_zec ] is very interesting in the case @xmath209 .",
    "this happens only when there is a separation between quantum and classical chromatic number , because for the chromatic number we have @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , as we show in the next section , some graphs with a large separation between quantum and classical chromatic number induce graphs with large separation between entanglement - assisted and classical one - shot zero - error capacity .      in this section",
    "we apply the observations made above .",
    "specifically , we isolate a new family of graphs for which the one - shot zero - error entanglement - assisted capacity is exponentially larger than its classical counterpart . each member of this family is a cartesian product of a hadamard graph with a complete graph .",
    "chromatic number and quantum chromatic number are known to be different for hadamard graphs with a sufficiently large number of vertices @xcite .",
    "graphs with such a separation are important in the attempt to quantify the information - theoretic gain permitted by the use of shared entanglement .",
