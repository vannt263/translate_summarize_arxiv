    "<S> states from the interior of the band gaps do not have universal behavior and require two parameters to describe their scaling properties . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between these two types of behavior occurs in an extremely narrow region of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> when the degree of disorder exceeds a certain critical value the single parameter scaling is restored for an entire band - gap .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we numerically study localization properties of band gap states in a one - dimensional periodic - on - average random system ( pars ) . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of system were extensively studied in the past in the context of electron localization , where they were known as kronig - penny - like models ( see , for example , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> classical wave versions of 1-_d _ pars also recently attracted a considerable attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these studies focused upon localization properties of states from pass ( conduction ) bands of the respective initial periodic systems , or states at band edges of the original spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> they were found to behave similarly to the one - dimensional anderson model , demonstrating single - parameter scaling ( sps ) and universality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> disorder , however , not only localizes states in the conduction bands of 1-_d _ systems , it also gives rise to localized states inside band gaps of the original spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this is well known in the physics of disordered semiconductors , where a vast literature on properties of localized states arising within forbidden gaps of semiconductors exists ( see , for example , book @xcite ) . in the case of one - dimensional models , </S>",
    "<S> however , these states have been studied surprisingly little . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , statistical properties of the lyapunov exponent ( the inverse localization length ) , @xmath0 , for these states have not been studied at all . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that the variance , @xmath1 , of the lyapunov exponent contains important information about spectral properties of these systems . from the frequency dependence of the variance </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the band gap states can be divided into two groups with qualitatively different localization properties separated by a sharp boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this means that though all states in 1-_d _ systems are localized , there might be two qualitatively different regimes of localization . </S>",
    "<S> the first regime corresponds to the band and band edge states , and has regular anderson behavior ( if disorder is locally weak ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second regime , associated with the gap states , does not obey sps and is not universal . </S>",
    "<S> the regular tight - binding anderson model also demonstrates violation of sps , when disorder becomes _ locally _ strong@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be empasized , therefore , that in our case the absence of sps is caused not by the strength of disorder , but by the different nature of the gap states . </S>",
    "<S> studying how @xmath1 and the lyapunov exponent ( le ) itself depend upon the degree of disorder ( rms fluctuations of a random parameter , @xmath2 ) we find that there exists a critical value , @xmath3 , at which the boundary between the groups of states with different localization properties disappears . at @xmath4 @xmath3 all the states have the regular anderson - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that in this situation sps is _ restored _ when disorder becomes stronger , contrary to what one would expect in the anderson model .    in the paper we deal with the classical wave version of pars and consider localization properties of scalar waves in a 1-@xmath5 superlattice composed of two alternating layers @xmath6 and @xmath7 with dielectric constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . the results , however , can also be applyed to kronig - penny - like models of electron localization . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce disorder in the system forcing the thickness @xmath10 of the _ b _ layers to change randomly assuming that @xmath10 is drawn independently from a uniform distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the described model is periodic on average with the spatial period equal to @xmath11 and with random positions of the boundaries between different layers . </S>",
    "<S> the states of the model are characterized by a dimensionless wave number @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the frequency and @xmath14 is the vacuum speed of light .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the model by means of the transfer - matrix method . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the system is described by the vector @xmath15 with components representing the wave field , @xmath16 and its spatial derivative , @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> the results of the calculations are presented in figures below . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the frequency dependence of le and its variance , @xmath35 , for frequencies covering one of the band - gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath36 coincides with the results reported previously in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of @xmath0 at the same time demonstrates anomalous non - monotonic behavior with two maxima inside the band . in the region between the maxima , @xmath37 changes _ oppositely _ to @xmath38 approaching its minimum value at the center of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is clearly inconsistent with sps , which dictates that @xmath39@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the dispersion of our random variable increases , the maxima of @xmath1 moves toward the center of the gap , and the central minimum raises . </S>",
    "<S> at some critical value , @xmath3 , double - peaked structure of @xmath1 dissapear , and at @xmath40 the variance exhibits only one maximum and goes along with le itself . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in this figure show that localization properties of band and band - edge states are different from those of the gap states . </S>",
    "<S> this difference sharply manifests itself in the dependence of le upon @xmath41 shown in fig . 2 for different @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence undergoes a strong qualitative change when the wave number moves toward the center of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in behavior of  le corresponding to the states from the pass band and the gap was previously discussed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the change between different shapes of the function @xmath43 occurs within a narrow frequency interval of the order of magnitude of @xmath44 suggesting existence of a well defined boundary between different groups of state . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that this boundary coincides with the position of the respective maximum of @xmath1 . for @xmath4 @xmath3 , where @xmath45 corresponds to the transformation between different types of behavior of @xmath1 , all functions @xmath43 for different @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> merge together demonstrating behavior independent of frequency of the states .    fig . 3 presents @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> directly plotted versus @xmath36 . in order to obtain this figure , </S>",
    "<S> we combine frequency dependences of le and its variance in the region covering several bands of the parent periodic system . </S>",
    "<S> this figure illustrates the violation of the sps in our system . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from comparison between this plot and the plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that anomalous non - linear dependence of @xmath46 versus @xmath36 is caused by the states from the inner region of the band gap between the two maxima of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the multibranch structure of the plot shows the lack of universality in this dependence : it is different for different band gaps . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we checked that different branches originate from frequencies corresponding to different band - gaps . </S>",
    "<S> double - lines , which form each of the branches , correspond to different halves of the same band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the insert in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 presents one of the branches that was obtained by filtering out all the frequencies except those that belong to one half of a band - gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonuniversal behavior of states from different band - gaps and a violation of sps are closely related phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the intimate relationship between nonuniversality and sps is demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> these plots show the evolution of the dependence of @xmath1 versus @xmath36 with an increase of the value of the standard deviation , @xmath48 of the layers thickness . </S>",
    "<S> one can observe that with an increase of @xmath41 , the variance of @xmath36 approaches a regular linear dependence upon @xmath36 . and </S>",
    "<S> along with this , all the branches from the different band - gaps merge into one universal curve . </S>",
    "<S> it happens at approximately the same values of @xmath41 at which the maxima on the frequency dependence of @xmath1 disappear , signaling about complete eroding of the initial band structure by the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> however , a destruction of the initial spectrum is not a uniform ( in terms of frequencies ) process - some bands disappear at smaller disorder than others . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , different branches of the graph in fig . 4 return to the universal behavior at different values of the disorder parameter , @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> the presented results suggest that the probability distribution function of le , @xmath49 , in the case of the inner gap states , can not be described by a single parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that in the asimptotic limit @xmath50 , @xmath49 retains its gaussian form with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> that means that statistical properties of the gap states are characterized by two independent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the similar situation occurs in the anderson model in the case of locally strong scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in our situation the local scattering , characterized by the mismatch between the dielectric parameters of the layers , is weak . </S>",
    "<S> the considered system , therefore , presents an example when two - parameter scaling occurs due to properties of the initial spectrum of the system rather then due to the strength of the disorder .    to suggest a qualitative explanation of the results let us first consider the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is more convenient to start with the states arising in the center of the forbidden band , which exhibit the smallest fluctuations of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this behavior lies in the fact that states deep in the forbidden band can only arise due to a strong deviation from the initial periodic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of such events is small , and such defect configurations , occurring at different parts of the structure , are separated from each other by distances much greater than localization lengths of states emerging due to these deviations . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions corresponding to different states do not overlap and such configurations can be considered as isolated defects . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the localization length in this case is determined solely by the initial spectrum of the system and the frequency of the corresponding local state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , fluctuations of @xmath0 would be equal to zero in the idealized situation of isolated defects . in the real case </S>",
    "<S> , we have small fluctuations due to overlap of exponential tails of different states , and rare occasions when two defects appears close to each other .    when @xmath42 moves from the center of the band - gap toward the boundary , the density of the configurations responsible for the states at corresponding frequencies and their localization lengths increase . </S>",
    "<S> first this leads to an increase in the fluctuation of le because the localization length is determined now by complexes of several interacting defect configurations , and becomes sensitive to the fluctuating structure of such complexes . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the band boundary is approached , the effect of self - averaging comes into play . with an increase of spatial overlap between states localized at different centers , </S>",
    "<S> self - averaging of le becomes more effective , leading , therefore , to the decrease of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these two tendencies generates nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath52 presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 .    arguments similar to that presented above can explain the difference in the the @xmath41-dependence of le for states from the inner part of the band - gaps and boundary states . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of le for states from the pass - bands and states at the band edges is well understood : @xmath53 for states from the pass bands , and @xmath54 at the band edges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that when @xmath55 le for states from the band - gap tends to a non zero value , which is just an inverse penetration length through the forbidden band . </S>",
    "<S> this penetration length obviously decreases when frequency approaches the center of the band - gap . </S>",
    "<S> disorder results in emergence of a small number of states with frequencies in the inner part of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> these states enhance propagation of waves due to a process similar to resonant tunneling , reducing by this means le . </S>",
    "<S> these arguments can not be applied to states at the band edge because their penetration length at @xmath56 is so large that even small disorder makes them indistinguishable from the states at the pass - band side of the edge .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the presented results that the violation of sps and the absence of universality in the considered system are due to nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting , however , to examine this behavior from the standpoint of general arguments leading to sps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to these arguments , sps is realized when the localization length @xmath57 is much greater than the phase randomization length @xmath58 . in the random phase model @xcite it </S>",
    "<S> is assumed that phase randomization occurs at a microscopic scale , and , violation of the inequality @xmath59 means that the localization length also becomes of microscopic size . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural , therefore , not to expect universality in this case . </S>",
    "<S> in our situation , however , localization length remains macroscopical even for states deep inside the gap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the absence of sps is not related to the influence of microscopic details of the system . at the same time one could expect the increase in @xmath58 in this spectral region , because the phase of a wave changes only when it crosses a localized state , which are very rare in this spectral region . </S>",
    "<S> one can assume , therefore , that for the state from the inner region of the band gap one can have @xmath60 even though both these lengths remain _ macroscopical_. in order to check this assumption , we studied a distribution of the phase , and determined the phase randomization length using simple neyman - person @xmath61 statistical tests to check the uniformity of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we used the plane wave representation for the transfer - matrix , and following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , define the phase , as a relative phase responsible for the scaling behavior of le . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the simulation confirm that the phase randomization length increases inside the gap , and exceeds the localization length for the states between maxima of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the transition from the inequality @xmath62 to @xmath60 occurs approximately in the same critical region , which separates the band - edge states from the inner states in figs.1 and 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , monte - carlo computer simulation of wave localization properties of a one - dimensional random periodic - on - average system shows that the spectrum of the system can be divided into two groups of states with qualitatively different statistical behavior of the lyapunov exponent and a narrow critical region separating these groups . </S>",
    "<S> the first group combines states from pass - bands of the parent periodic system and band edge states from the band - gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical properties of this group are similar to the properties of the anderson model and can be described by the single - parameter - scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the other group consists of states from the inner region of the band - gaps and demonstrate a number of anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of le , for this group decreases when the frequency approaches the center of a band - gap resulting in a strong deviation from single - parameter - scaling - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath1 upon le is nonuniversal for these states and is different for different band gaps . the transition between the two groups is also accompanied by the reversal of the relationship between the localization length and phase randomization length : for a pass - band and band edge states @xmath63 , and @xmath60  for inner band - gap states . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the degree of randomness beyond a well defined critical value erodes the difference between the groups and returns the system to the regular single - parameter - scaling mode of behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this can be interpreted as a complete destruction of the original band structure by disorder .    </S>",
