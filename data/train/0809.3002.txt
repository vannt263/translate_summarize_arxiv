    "baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) before recombination left wiggling features in the matter power spectrum . at large scale",
    "where the evolution of the density perturbation is still linear , such features is preserved in the galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this provides us with a well calibrated standard ruler , which enables precise measurement of cosmological parameters , especially the dark energy parameters @xcite . like cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    ", the physics involved is relatively clean and well understood , hence it is arguably less affected by unknown systematic errors , which might undermine empirical - rule based methods such as the type ia supernovae ( snia ) and the cluster abundance measurements .",
    "recently , such a bao feature have been observed in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) survey data@xcite . a number of more powerful bao surveys are being planned .",
    "some examples are wigglez @xcite , sdss-3 ( boss ) , hetdex , wfmos @xcite , adept , space / euclid @xcite in the optical / ir and fast , hshs@xcite , ska @xcite in the radio .    in this paper , we make forecasts on cosmological constraints from bao measurement in future surveys with the _ large sky area multi - object spectroscopic telescope _ , or lamost@xcite , a telescope being built in china .",
    "the lamost is a 4 meter schmidt telescope with a field of view of 20 @xmath1 .",
    "equipped with 4000 optical fibers that are individually positioned by computer during observation , it is able to take spectra of 4000 targets simultanously . more details of the lamost telescope are described in appendix a. the lamost is ideally suited for conducting large scale redshift surveys .",
    "we expect that once lamost becomes operational , it will carry out several different survey projects .",
    "the design of such surveys should maximize the scientific output for a given amount of observing fiber time .",
    "some obvious choices include a magnitude limited general galaxy redshift survey , and a magnitude limited quasar survey .",
    "for the purpose of bao measurements , it is desirable to have additional surveys for targets at relatively higher redshift",
    ". often found to be the bright central galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters , the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) @xcite can be detected at higher redshifts than a typical galaxy for a given apparent magnitude .",
    "quasars can be observed at even higher redshifts . in the sdss surveys ,",
    "quasars were very sparse , making it difficult to use in bao measurement @xcite .",
    "however , it is expected that the density of observable quasars with the lamost is much higher , since a lower limiting flux can be reached .",
    "therefore , we also consider quasar samples in our study , with quasar themselves as the tracer of the large - scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the absorption lines ( ly@xmath2 forest ) in the quasar spectra also provide useful information @xcite , which will be considered in our future work .",
    "we describe these surveys in more detail ( including the selection of the sample , the required observing fiber hours , and the estimate of bias of the sample ) in appendix b.    we will make forecasts of the measurement errors on the dark energy equation of state and other cosmological parameters with these surveys , and also estimate the resources required for these surveys .",
    "we will first use the fisher matrix method @xcite .",
    "then for a few cases we also use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation to make the forecast .",
    "the advantages of the fisher matrix method are that it can easily be used to explore large parameter space and that the relationship between the input and output is very clear",
    ". the mcmc method does not assume the likelihood to be gaussian and thus can probe the full shape of the likelihood surface .",
    "previous studies have shown that it is feasible with the lamost to obtain better precisions in cosmological parameters than ongoing surveys like the sdss @xcite .",
    "the study by @xcite were conducted before the importance of bao in dark energy measurement was widely recognized .",
    "@xcite considered the alcock - paczynski test @xcite in real space @xcite , with a method different from the one we use . in all of these studies , a single survey of galaxies up to @xmath3 were considered , assuming an total survey area of @xmath4 , a total number of galaxies @xmath5 , and a galaxy sample bias of 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we try to make a _ realistic _ assessment of lamost surveys .",
    "we consider different samples that could be collected by the lamost telescope within a reasonable amount of observation time .",
    "the surveyed sky area is assumed to be about @xmath6 , for which the sdss photometric survey catalogue is currently available for target selection .",
    "we use the published sdss luminosity function to estimate the number of targets . in order to accurately estimate the measurement error for the given sample ,",
    "it is necessary to know the bias of the sample .",
    "we use the halo model to estimate the bias of the samples .",
    "it should be noted that in the methods employed here @xcite , the treatment of the non - linear effect and redshift distortion is very crude .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of scale independent clustering bias may be overly idealistic .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the bao in both the power spectrum and correlation function by using the renormalized perturbation theory(rpt , @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that mode - coupling typically leads to percent - level shifts in the acoustic peak of correlation function .",
    "@xcite have also shown with both numerical simulation and analytical calculation that the peak is moved by these effects .",
    "@xcite proposed a new method to extract the unbiased estimation of sound horizon scale based on a large n - body simulation and semi - analytical galaxy formation model .",
    "@xcite also presented high signal - to - noise ratio measurements of acoustic scale from large volume simulations , and obtained a robust measurements of acoustic scale with scatter close to that predicted by the methods utilized in this paper .",
    "there have also been works on scale dependent halo and galaxy bias @xcite . in analysing the real data to extract cosmological information ,",
    "a more refined treatment is required to account for all these effects .",
    "we review the methods for error forecasting in   2 .",
    "  2.1 is devoted to the fisher matrix method , which was developed by @xcite for bao measurements ;   2.2",
    "is devoted to the mcmc method ; in   2.3 we discuss how to estimate the bias of the sample for the planned surveys . after a brief description of the data that we assume lamost",
    "could collect , we present our forecast on the bao measurement precision in   3 , and conclude in   4 . in the appendices ,",
    "we describe the characteristics of the lamost telescope ( appendix a ) , and the details of our survey design ( appendix b ) , including the generic main survey ( appendix b1 ) , the lrg survey ( appendix b2 ) , and the qso survey ( appendix b3 ) .",
    "we estimate the density and bias of each sample , and also discuss the fiber time required for completing each survey .    throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt the flat @xmath7cdm , with the wmap three year @xcite best fitted parameter values (  @xmath8  ) as our fiducial model .",
    "before recombination , the presence of large number of free electrons ensures that the photons and baryon plasma are tightly coupled .",
    "this provides a resilient force against any motion induced by gravity .",
    "acoustic waves are generated from the primordial fluctuations .",
    "when the universe is sufficiently cooled for the photons and baryons to decouple , the oscillation ceases and the waves are imprinted on the matter and radiation density power spectra @xcite , with the ( comoving ) characteristic scale ( the bao scale ) determined by the sound horizon at the last scattering surface : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sound speed . for a given set of cosmological parameters , the absolute scale of sound horizon can be calculated .    when making measurement of the matter power spectrum in a galaxy survey , the distances along and perpendicular to the line of sight are measured from redshift and angular separation respectively .",
    "the comoving distances are given by @xcite @xmath11 the bao scale provides a standard ruler to measure the angular diameter distance @xmath12 and the hubble expansion rate @xmath13 . in a model with dark energy equation of state @xmath14 ,",
    "these are given by @xmath15^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 in this paper , we consider both a constant equation of state @xmath17 for the dark energy , and a redshift - dependent one parameterized in the form of @xmath18=w_0+w_a\\frac{z}{1+z}.\\ ] ]    the statistical error in lss measurements includes sampling variance due to the finite volume of the survey , as well as shot noise . in fourier space ,",
    "the statistical error is the summation of these two effects @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the survey volume and @xmath21 is the effective volume defined as @xmath22 ^ 2 d{\\vec r}.\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the cosine of the angle between direction of @xmath24 and the line of sight , and @xmath25 is the comoving number density of galaxies . for constant @xmath26 , @xmath27 ^ 2 v_{\\rm s}.\\ ] ]      in reality , the galaxy power spectrum is observed in redshift space .",
    "the conversion from redshifts to physical scales depends on cosmological parameters @xcite , @xmath30 where the subscript `` ref '' denotes quantities calculated in the reference cosmology , @xmath31 is the bias factor for the galaxy sample , @xmath32 is the growth factor , and @xmath33 is the redshift distortion factor , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath36 components perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight , respectively , and @xmath37 is the shot noise contribution .",
    "the measurement error of the power spectrum depends on the amplitude of the power spectrum , which is given by @xmath38 in the @xmath36 range relevant for bao measurement .",
    "thus , the uncertainty depends sensitively on the value of the bias @xmath31 of the sample .",
    "we present our method of estimating the bias parameter in   2.3 .",
    "the measurements are also subject to some systematic errors , such as the effect of redshift - distortion due to peculiar velocity , non - linear evolution of the power spectrum , scale - dependent bias , and finite spectrograph resolution .",
    "non - linear evolution of the density fluctuation enhances small scale power , which corresponds to a smearing of the acoustic signature @xcite .",
    "this can be estimated by convolving a gaussian displacement field with the linear correlation function , @xmath39 where @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the derivative of the growth factor .",
    "the observed power spectrum is smeared below the resolution of the spectroscopic measurement .",
    "we model such smearing as a gaussian , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the resolution of the spectroscopic measurement .",
    "we consider @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ( for more details see appendix a ) .",
    "the finite spectra resolution has the effect of smearing small scale powers .",
    "we set @xmath51 .",
    "the modes at very large scales contribute very little to the integral in equation  ( 9 ) , so we set @xmath52 .",
    "the parameters involved include cosmological parameters and survey parameters . to define a cosmological model , the following set of parameters are included : the hubble constant @xmath53 , baryon density @xmath54 , matter density @xmath55 , dark energy density @xmath56 , dark energy equation of state @xmath17 , spectrum normalization @xmath57 , spectral index @xmath58 , reionization optical depth @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , for each redshift bin @xmath60 of the survey , we have parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , growth function @xmath63 , linear redshift distortion @xmath64 , and shot noise @xmath65 .    to obtain useful constraints on cosmological parameters , it is necessary to break the degeneracy by combining the bao data with data obtained from some other cosmological observations , e.g. , cmb and/or type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "consider first the combination of bao and cmb , the total fisher matrix is then given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the fisher matrix derived from the @xmath26th redshift bin of the large scale structure redshift survey .",
    "the cmb fisher matrix is expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 multipole for @xmath71 ( temperature correlation ) , @xmath72 ( @xmath72 mode polarization correlation ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath73 mode polarization correlation ) , and @xmath74 ( temperature - polarization cross - correlation ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the elements of the covariance matrix @xmath75 between various power spectra are @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the inverse square of the detector noise level on a steradian patch for temperature and polarization , respectively .",
    "@xmath78 $ ] is the beam function , @xmath79 is the full - width , half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the beam in radians .",
    "we shall assume that the cmb data would come from planck , which is scheduled to be launched in 2009 . by the time that the data of any of the surveys considered here is collected , planck should have been in operation for at least three years .",
    "therefore , we assume that cmb measurement errors correspond to planck three - year observation ( see table   [ tab : planck ] ) .          finally , we consider a qso survey .",
    "the ly@xmath2 forest of the qso can be a powerful probe of the baryon acoustic oscillation @xcite , but here the qso itself is used as tracers .",
    "in past surveys such as the 2df and sdss , the low number density of qsos prevents it from being a good tracer target for measuring bao features .",
    "however , with lamost the comoving number density can be greater , making it more useful for such purpose . using the 2slaq sample @xcite , which consists of 5645 quasars down to @xmath80 in 105.7 deg@xmath81",
    ", we obtain a luminosity function of the quasars .",
    "unlike the schechter form of galaxies luminosity function , the qso luminosity function is modelled as a double power law @xcite @xmath82 for estimation we assume here that the evolution with redshift is pure luminosity evolution , individual quasars is fainter today than at z = 2 , with the dependence of the characteristic luminosity described by @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 . in reality",
    ", the evolution of quasar luminosity function may be due to a combination of decreasing space density and decreasing luminosity of individual quasars , but this would not significantly affect our result .",
    "we calculated the qso k - correction by assuming that the continuum @xmath85 .",
    "the quasar number density is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : den_qso ] . consider samples with the magnitude limits , @xmath86 ( qso1 ) , @xmath87 ( qso2 ) , and @xmath88 ( qso3 ) , all between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the density of these magnitude limited samples drops at low redshift , because there is a lower limit @xmath91 on the absolute luminosity for quasars ( this also reflects a decrease in quasar activity at low redshifts ) .",
    "the turning redshift @xmath92 is the place where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "they are @xmath95 .",
    "the angular density of the qso1 is @xmath96 , and the total number is 0.24 million for 8000 @xmath1 .",
    "the observing time is about 15 minutes for signal - to - noise ratio @xmath97 , so it requires about 0.06 million fiber hours . for qso2 sample ,",
    "the angular density is @xmath98 , the spectrum can be obtained within 30 minutes for the same s / n , and requires 0.18 million fiber hours . the angular density of qso3 is @xmath99 , the required integration time is 1.5 hours , depending on the sky background .",
    "it needs 0.855 million fiber hours to complete the survey .",
    "the bias of a qso sample can be estimated using the method given in  2.3 .",
    "alternatively , it can also be measured directly from the projected two point correlation function .",
    "@xcite made an measurement with about 14,000 quasars at @xmath100 in the 2df/6df qso redshift survey .",
    "they found a slightly greater bias ( see table .",
    "[ tab : bias ] ) than that of the estimate obtained using the method of  2.3 .",
    "the difference is greater at higher redshifts ( 10% at @xmath101 , and 25% at @xmath102 ) @xcite .",
    "our estimate may be improved by using more detailed semi - analytical models , but for our purpose this simple estimate should suffice .",
