    "existence of non - zero temperature for a black hole supports the hypothesis that the relation between entropy and the area of the event horizon of a black hole has some physical significance .",
    "knowledge of this quantity makes possible to obtain the entropy of a black hole as a function of some fundamental parameters which describes such system ; namely , a thermodynamic fundamental equation for the black hole .",

    "although a formal study of black hole thermodynamics can be explored from a more fundamental perspective  @xcite , it is not the goal of this work to pursue this path . instead , in this work exploration of the thermodynamic information that can be extracted from the _ assumed _ existence of a thermodynamic fundamental equation is considered , as would be done for an ordinary thermodynamic system .",

    "these relations are equivalent to the eos in a simple thermodynamic system .",
    "then , we have the expression : @xmath25 such relation is analogous to the thermodynamic fundamental equation of a simple system . in a conventional thermodynamic system",

    "this property is reflected in the fact that for a conventional thermodynamic system , the fundamental equation is a homogeneous first - order function of some extensive parameters .",
    "similarly , the eos of a conventional thermodynamic system are homogeneous zero order functions . however , for the kerr - newman black hole , fundamental equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , is not an homogeneous first - order function . two major implications for thermodynamics systems : first",

    "there is a region where temperature is a monotonically increasing function of entropy , and a second region where @xmath22 drops asymptotically until it reaches a certain value for maximum entropy .",
    "presence of those regions for temperature is related to the stability of the system .    in the entropic representation ,",
    "the system has a relation between internal energy and angular momentum , establishing a boundary beyond which the proposed model has no physical meaning .",

    "two relations that describe the dependence of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in terms of the basic set of response functions are :    @xmath62    @xmath63    the specific heat at constant angular momentum is calculated ,    @xmath64    it is possible to notice the existence of a negative region . since the second term is reduced for an increasing entropy and subtraction inside the brackets will eventually result in a positive quantity , causing that the specific heat becomes negative , for sufficiently large values of entropy .",
    "negative region for the specific heat is known long ago for gravitational systems  @xcite in general , and for black holes in particular  @xcite .",
    "two interpretations about negative specific heat arise .",
    "+ one is related to the transfer of energy as heat ; having a region of negative heat implies that the temperature of a black hole raises to a higher value , with energy transfer  @xcite .",

    "different representations for the fundamental equation leads to the existence of various derivatives of independent variables related to each thermodynamic potential , apparently unrelated with other derivatives .",
