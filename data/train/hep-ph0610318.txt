    "precision observables are a unique laboratory to test the standard model ( sm ) or extensions at the quantum level . via quantum effects ,",
    "heavy particles enter the theoretical predictions for such observables , and comparing measurements with predictions leads to valuable information e.g.  on the masses of postulated particles such as higgs bosons or supersymmetric particles .",
    "the power of precision observables is illustrated by comparing the current experimental resolution to the numerical size of quantum effects in the sm and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in the case of the mass of the @xmath2 boson , @xmath0 , the sm one - loop and two - loop effects amout to about @xmath3 times the current experimental uncertainty of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the weak sm one - loop and two - loop contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath5 are about @xmath6 times as large as the current experimental uncertainty of @xmath7 parts per million @xcite .",
    "the mssm is a weakly coupled , renormalizable gauge theory @xcite , and therefore quantum effects are well - defined and calculable . in the mssm ,",
    "quantum effects from supersymmetric ( susy ) particles to @xmath0 and @xmath8 depend on many mssm parameters , but they can be as large as the corresponding sm quantum effects and thus significantly larger than the experimental uncertainty .",
    "conversely , the experimental measurements significantly constrain the susy parameter space ( see e.g.  the reviews @xcite ) .    in these proceedings",
    "we give an update on the current status and recent theoretical developments of the two observables @xmath0 and @xmath8 in the mssm .",
    "the mass of the @xmath2-boson @xmath0 has been measured at lep and is being measured at tevatron .",
    "the current experimental value is @xmath9 @xcite , and the precision could be improved to @xmath10  mev at the lhc @xcite and to @xmath11  mev at a linear @xmath12 collider @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the sm or mssm predict a calculable relation between @xmath0 and the muon lifetime @xmath13 and @xmath14 . solving",
    "this relation for @xmath0 leads to a prediction of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and all other model parameters , in particular the masses of the top quark , higgs bosons , and susy particles in the case of the mssm . for the sm prediction of @xmath0 see @xcite and references therein ; for a review of previously available mssm contributions to @xmath0 see @xcite .",
    "more recently , the yukawa - enhanced @xmath15 contributions to @xmath0 have been evaluated @xcite .",
    "this result completes the evaluation of all two - loop mssm contributions to @xmath0 that enter via the quantity @xmath16 .",
    "detailed estimates for the remaining two - loop contributions , which go beyond @xmath16 , and for unknown higher - order contributions have been derived @xcite .    in @xcite , all existing sm and mssm results",
    "have been combined with a new evaluation of the one - loop mssm contribution that also takes into account complex phases . in this way , a very precise and reliable prediction for @xmath0 in the mssm has been obtained .",
    "this prediction has been implemented in a computer code that will be made publicly avaliable .",
    "the remaining theory error of this mssm prediction of @xmath0 , due to the unknown multi - loop contributions estimated in @xcite and to the unknown phase dependence beyond the one - loop level @xcite , has been estimated to @xmath17  mev , depending on the susy mass scale .",
    "hence the precision of this prediction is better than the current experimental precision and matches the foreseen precision after lhc and a linear @xmath12 collider .     in the sm ( red /",
    "medium shaded ) and the mssm ( green / light shaded ) as function of the top mass @xmath18 .",
    "the susy parameters are varied independently in a random parameter scan in the following ranges : the diagonal entries of the squark and slepton mass matrices are varied between @xmath19  gev , @xmath20 , @xmath21  gev , @xmath22  gev .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath0 is shown for @xmath23  gev .",
    "[ fig : mwmt],width=340 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -110,30)(-18,40)whitewhite    the predictions for @xmath0 in the sm and the mssm are compared in figure [ fig : mwmt ] . the possible predictions within the two models as a function of all model parameters give rise to two bands in the @xmath18@xmath0 plane with only a relatively small overlap region ( blue area ) . for the employed parameter regions",
    "see the caption of figure [ fig : mwmt ] .",
    "the mssm band is divided into two regions . in the very light - shaded green region",
    "at least one of the ratios @xmath24 or @xmath25 exceeds  2.5 , while in the green region the mass ratios are unconstrained .",
    "the current 68%  c.l .",
    "experimental results for @xmath18 and @xmath0 slightly favour the mssm over the sm . more importantly , both within the mssm and the sm , the precision of the experimental measurements excludes large regions of parameter space .",
    "the prospective accuracies for the lhc and the ilc with gigaz option are also shown in the plot ( using the current central values ) , indicating the potential for a significant improvement of the sensitivity of the electroweak precision tests .",
    "the impressive measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath8 @xcite has inspired a lot of progress on the theoretical side .",
    "after many refinements ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , the sm prediction deviates by about two standard deviations from the final experimental value , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the mssm prediction of @xmath8 has been reviewed recently in @xcite .",
    "the leading contributions from susy particles are approximately given by @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "due to the enhancement @xmath28 , the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , the susy contributions could easily be the origin of the deviation @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the positive value of this deviation implies a preference for a positive @xmath30-parameter in the mssm .",
    "the status of the mssm prediction is as follows .",
    "the one - loop contributions have been known for a long time ( e.g.  @xcite ; for further references see @xcite ) .",
    "the two - loop contributions can be devided into two classes .",
    "the class with closed loops of susy particles , such as squark or chargino / neutralino loops , is completely known @xcite ; the class without such loops is known in the leading - log approximation @xcite .",
    "the one - loop and leading two - loop contributions have a very compact analytical form , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainty due to unknown higher - order contributions has been estimated to be smaller than @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this is satisfactory at the moment , but it could be significantly improved by a computation of the remaining two - loop contributions .    the current status of @xmath8 in the mssm is summarized in figure [ fig : amu ] , which shows the possible mssm contributions to @xmath8 compared with the observed deviation between experiment and the sm prediction . clearly , the mssm can accomodate the experimental result for @xmath8 , and the preferred mass scale is rather low .",
