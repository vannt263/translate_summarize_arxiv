    "in stellar nucleosynthesis involving charged particles two probability distributions are playing crucial role : the coulomb penetration probability and the maxwell  boltzmann energy distribution . the first strongly increases with increasing particle energy , but at a given temperature the probability of a particle having high energy falls off rapidly , following the maxwell  boltzmann distribution .",
    "the coulomb penetration probability folded with the maxwell  boltzmann distribution forms the so - called gamow peak , and the nuclear reactions are occurring in this narrow energy window @xcite . in order to provide reliable nuclear data for the astrophysical calculations ,",
    "the experiments have to be performed in the gamow window or at energies as close as possible . at higher burning temperatures",
    "this energy window can be shifted up to higher energies , however , it remains mostly well below the coulomb barrier , making it hard or even impossible to perform experiments at astrophysically relevant energies @xcite . here  since experimental data is missing in the most relevant mass range for the so - called astrophysical @xmath2-process , too  we propose a new experimental approach to measure the cross sections of important nuclear reactions .",
    ".[tab : activation ] existing experimental ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) database relevant for the astrophysical @xmath2-process measured via activation method and @xmath2-counting in the a @xmath9 100 region .",
    "the target nuclei , the half - lives of the reaction products , the gamow windows @xcite and the lowest energies measured ( e@xmath10 ) are given . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the decay parameters of @xmath5lu taken from literature are summarized in table [ tab : decay ] .",
    "the activity of all samples has been measured with a leps detector ( gl2015r type , produced by canberra ) .",
    "the characteristic x - ray countings were carried out using two geometries : after the irradiation , the targets were put 12 cm away from the detector ( far geometry ) .",
    "the countings were repeated several times , 1 - 4 weeks later in close geometry , in these cases the target detector distance was 5 cm .",
    "the absolute efficiency of the leps detector was determined using the 53.16 kev line of @xmath11ba and the 59.54 kev line of the @xmath12am calibrated radioactive sources in far geometry where the true coincidence effect is negligible .",
    "a linear fit for the measured absolute efficiencies were used to determine the absolute efficiencies in the 53 kev - 60 kev energy range .",
    "taking into account the elapsed time and the decay between the countings , a conversion factor between the two geometries was calculated and used to derive the absolute efficiency in close geometry .    at higher bombarding energies ( at and above 15 mev ) the @xmath2-activity of the targets has also been measured with a 40% relative efficiency hpge detector , while at 13.5 mev and 14 mev a 100% relative efficiency hpge detector in ultra low background ( ulb ) configuration has been used .",
    "the cross section of the ( @xmath1,n ) reaction obtained from the measurements with the leps and the hpge detectors were found to be in agreement within 4% .",
    "@xmath2-lines belonging to the @xmath0tm(@xmath13)@xmath3lu reaction were not observable in the @xmath2-spectra taken either with the ulb or the hpge detectors .",
    "the cross sections of the @xmath0tm(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3lu reaction were determined by counting the yield of the k@xmath14 and k@xmath15 characteristic x - ray lines using the leps in close geometry .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows typical spectra measured with the hpge detector ( upper panel , t@xmath16 = 18.47 h ) and the leps ( lower panel , t@xmath16 = 168 d ) after irradiating the @xmath0tm target with a 15.5 mev @xmath1 beam . in the measured x - ray spectra it is impossible to distinguish between events coming from the decay of the different lu isotopes .",
    "however , there is a large difference in their half - lives and therefore we can assume that  even if the cross sections were the same  the yield measured after the irradiation would be dominated by the decay of @xmath4lu . to determine the cross section of the @xmath0tm(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction , the activity measurement using the leps was repeated twice , @xmath17 168 days and 200 days after irradiating the targets with @xmath1 beam . during the cooling period of more than 24 weeks the @xmath4lu activity of the targets decreased by a factor of more than 3",
    "x 10@xmath18 , therefore the observed x - ray yield belongs solely to the decay of the @xmath3lu produced only by the @xmath0tm(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction .",
    "the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) cross sections obtained in the 2 measurements are within 3% .",
    "the target material contained fe and ge impurities .",
    "the 73 kev and 122 kev background peaks , originating from the decay of the reaction products of @xmath19ge(@xmath1,n)@xmath20se and @xmath21fe(@xmath1,n)@xmath22ni , were used to monitor the detector efficiency .",
    "no long term variation in the efficiency was found .",
    "in astrophysical investigations it is common to quote the astrophysical @xmath23 factor . the cross section , @xmath24(e ) and the astrophysical @xmath23 factor , @xmath23(e ) at c.m .",
    "energy @xmath25 are related by :    @xmath26    with @xmath27 being the sommerfeld parameter .",
    "several irradiations at the same energies were repeated , the astrophysical @xmath23 factors shown in table [ tab : results ] were derived from the averaged results of the irradiations weighted by the statistical uncertainty of the measured values .",
    "the effective center of mass energies ( e@xmath8 ) in the second column take into account the energy loss of the @xmath1 beam in the target .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in the e@xmath8 values corresponds to the energy stability of the @xmath1 beam and to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target .",
    "the uncertainty of the @xmath23 factors is the quadratic sum of the following partial errors : efficiency of the hpge detector and leps ( 6% and 4% , respectively ) , number of target atoms ( 4% ) , current measurement ( 3% ) , uncertainty of decay parameters ( @xmath28  5 % ) and counting statistics ( 0.5 - 7% ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath23 factors have been compared to predictions of the statistical model ( hauser  feshbach ) code non - smoker@xmath29 v5.8.1 @xcite .",
    "this code is a further development of the non - smoker statistical model code @xcite and includes , among other modifications , updated masses and excited states of nuclei .",
    "the results underline the importance of measurements at energies as close as possible to the astrophysically relevant energy window . the reaction cross sections are sensitive to different nuclear properties depending on the projectile energy and reaction type .",
    "it is already known that the standard optical @xmath1+nucleus potential by @xcite , widely used in astrophysical calculations , may not be optimal at @xmath1 energies close to or below the coulomb barrier .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : an ] showing @xmath23 factors for the ( @xmath1,n ) channel . in the measured energy range ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath23 factors for this reaction are mainly sensitive to the calculated average @xmath1 widths which , in turn , mainly depend on the optical potential used .",
    "the calculation using the standard potential ( theory1 ) overestimates the cross section by a factor of 2 ( this is demonstrated on the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : an ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation using the potential of @xcite ( theory2 ) is much closer to our experimental values , especially at low energies , without any renormalization .",
    "this confirms earlier findings that this potential describes low - energy @xmath1-induced reactions better although it does not reproduce scattering data .",
    "this puzzle needs further investigation both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the @xmath0tm(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) @xmath23 factors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ag ] ) are not described well with either potential . however , the values obtained with the potential of @xcite ( theory2 ) are again much closer to the experimental values than the ones obtained with the standard potential @xcite ( theory1 ) .",
    "contrary to the ( @xmath1,n ) reaction , the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction cross sections are not only sensitive to the optical potential but also to the calculated @xmath2 width . since the ( @xmath1,n )",
    "@xmath23 factors are described well with the potential of @xcite , we can assume that the remaining deficiencies in the reproduction of the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) excitation function are due to the calculated average @xmath2 width .",
    "this width itself depends on the gdr properties and the level density of @xmath3lu , which are both experimentally undetermined",
    ". however , the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction rate at @xmath30 process temperatures is insensitive to the @xmath2 width and therefore an inadequate modeling is astrophysically inconsequential .",
    "in the present work the cross section of the @xmath0tm(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) and @xmath0tm(@xmath1,n ) reactions were determined well below the coulomb barrier with high precision ( @xmath28 10% total uncertainty ) in spite of the very long half - life ( 500 and 6.7 d ) of the reaction products by counting the characteristic x - ray radiation .",
    "it has to be emphasized that this method is less sensitive to the usual obstacles of the activation technique such as low @xmath2 branching ratios or long half - lives .",
    "moreover , not only ( @xmath13 ) reactions in the region of the heavy @xmath30 nuclei can be studied via this x - ray radiation approach but it can be used also for other applications provided the reaction products decay via electron - capture , e.g. , in ( @xmath2,n ) , ( @xmath2,p ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath1 ) photoactivation studies .",
