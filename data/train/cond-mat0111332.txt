    "progress in microfabrication technology has made mesoscopic superconductors ( mesoscopic disks , in particular ) a very popular subject of study ( see , for example , refs .",
    "mesoscopic samples have sizes comparable to the coherence length  @xmath0 and the magnetic field penetration length  @xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour of such structures in an external magnetic field  @xmath2 is strongly influenced by the sample shape  @xcite and may lead to various superconducting states  @xcite .",
    "the vortex structure in mesoscopic disks with finite thickness was studied early using a numerical solution of the system of two coupled non - linear ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations  @xcite . for _ thin _ disks it is possible to simplify the solution of the problem by averaging the order parameter over the disk thickness  @xcite and by representing the superconducting order parameter as a superposition of eigenfunctions of the linearized gl equation  @xcite .",
    "but , even then the problem has still to be solved numerically because of the presence of confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "it was shown previously that in some limiting cases the description of the vortex structure can be simplified .",
    "buzdin and brisson  @xcite described certain vortex configurations in a small superconducting disk within the london approximation .",
    "calculated the vortex structure of mesoscopic disks at the vicinity of the dual point @xmath3",
    "@xcite and in the london limit  @xcite .",
    "recently , the structure of a giant vortex in an infinite plane was analyzed analytically within the gl theory for arbitrary values of @xmath4 in the limits of small and large values of the vorticity  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain analytical results for the free energy of small disks within the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , using the magnetic flux trapped by the disk as an expansion parameter .",
    "we consider a mesoscopic superconducting disk with radius @xmath5 and thickness @xmath6 magnetized by the external magnetic field @xmath7 which is uniform and directed normal to the disk plane .",
    "the theoretical model was already described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and therefore we scetch only those steps which are necessary for our analytical approach . for a thin disk , to a first approximation , the magnetic field is uniform inside the disk and equal to the external one . as a result of this approximation ,",
    "the distribution of the superconducting order parameter in the disk plane @xmath8 is described by the first gl equation @xmath9 with @xmath10 and with the boundary condition at the sample surface @xmath11 the index @xmath12 refers to the two - dimensional operator . due to the circular symmetry of the sample we use cylindrical coordinates : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the radial distance from the disk center , @xmath15 is the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "all distances are measured in units of the coherence length  @xmath0 , the magnetic field in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the thermodynamical critical field .    in the giant vortex state",
    "@xcite the order parameter can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 ^{2m}dt ,   \\label{inteigf1}\\ ] ] are the eigenfunctions of the linearized eq .",
    "( [ gl1 ] ) and @xmath21 determines the spectrum of the lowest landau levels , @xmath22 is the kummer function  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is determined by a non - linear equation , which results from the boundary condition  ( [ bc1 ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( measured in units of @xmath26 ) is the magnetic flux through the disk in the absence of any flux expulsion .",
    "the free energy , measured in @xmath27 units , is @xmath28",
    "first , we have to solve the non - linear eq .  [ equatbc ] . in the case of small @xmath29",
    "we can restrict the series  ( [ kummer1 ] ) for the kummer function by the first four terms .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "[ equatbc ] can be written as an infinite series of which the first four terms are @xmath30 + \\ldots . \\label{njuas1}\\ ] ]    in the limit of large @xmath31 we use the asymptotic expression for the kummer function @xmath32 .",

    "[ equatbc ] we obtain the equation @xmath33 , which leads to the solution @xmath34      substituting @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ njuas1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eigenval1 ] ) we obtain the eigenvalues @xmath35 in the @xmath36 limit : @xmath37    \\label{lam_as } \\\\ & & -\\frac{2l}{r^{2}}\\phi + \\frac{\\left ( l+1\\right ) } { \\left ( l+2\\right ) r^{2}}% \\left [ 1-\\frac{l}{\\left ( l+2\\right ) \\left ( l+3\\right ) } -\\frac{l^{2}\\left ( l-1\\right ) } { \\left ( l+2\\right ) ^{2}\\left ( l+3\\right ) \\left ( l+4\\right ) } % \\right ] \\phi ^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{l+1}{2\\left ( l+2\\right ) ^{3}\\left ( l+3\\right ) \\left ( l+4\\right ) r^{2}}\\phi ^{4}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because series  ( [ njuas1 ] ) is asymptotic , each new term gives a contribution to all the coefficients of the @xmath29-series .    in the @xmath31 limit",
    "we obtain for @xmath35 the asymptotic expression @xmath38 which does not depend on the vorticity @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the @xmath40 dependences are shown for a disk with radius @xmath41 .",
    "only the curves with @xmath42 are shown .",
    "the solid curves represent the dependences calculated from the numerical solution of expressions  ( [ eigenval1 ] ) and  ( [ equatbc ] ) and the dashed curves are our new approximate results as given by eq .",
    "( [ lam_as ] ) .",
    "notice that for small values of the magnetic flux the approximate expression  ( [ lam_as ] ) describes quite well the lowest landau level spectrum .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath35 , eq .  ( [ eigenval1 ] ) ,",
    "determine the minimal free energy @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ free_en1 ] ) , of the giant vortices .",
    "we expand eq .",
    "( [ free_en1 ] ) in a series with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "we found that for small disks with radius @xmath44 it is sufficient to keep in the series  ( [ kummer1 ] ) only the first four terms .",
    "expanding the free energy up to order @xmath45 we obtain the approximate expressions : @xmath46 @xmath47 the free energy for the next @xmath39 states has the same form as @xmath48 but with different numeric coefficients and , therefore , will not be give here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the free energy of the disk with @xmath49 is shown .",
    "notice that limiting oneselves to terms in @xmath43 up to @xmath50 leads to a poor approximation , while including terms up to @xmath45 results in an excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] present the free energy calculated with the expression @xmath51 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and rewritten in the notation of the present paper ) .",
    "notice that expression  ( [ f_akkerm ] ) describes less accurately our numerical result ( solid curves ) .",
    "it agrees for @xmath52 with our @xmath50 approximation , but for @xmath53 there is a substantial deviation with our approximate result .",
    "this disagreement is even larger for @xmath54 and is therefore not given .",
    "we calculated approximate expressions for the lowest landau levels and the free energy of the giant vortex states in thin mesoscopic disk with small radius .",
    "we found that these approximate analytical expressions agree very well with the more involved numerical calculation  @xcite and are a substantial improvement to those found in ref .",
