    "ngc  1901 is a loose aggregate of stars ( see fig .  1 , left panel ) in doradus , and it is the subject of a recent paper by pavani et al .",
    "they present new ccd photometry , which they combine with proper motions and conclude that ngc  1901 is a physical aggregate , whose features are not typical of a classical open cluster , but better describe an open cluster remnant .",
    "this is quite clear from the vector point diagram in fig  1 ( right panel ) which shows a clear concentration of stars having the same tangential motion .",
    "+ in this study we present a radial velocity survey of the 16 brightest stars in ngc  1901 , which allow us to better constrain the cluster membership , an derive updated estimates of its fundamental parameters .    in fig .  2 ( left panel ) we present a few example of high resolution spectra , whereas in fig",
    "2 ( right panel ) we show the radial velocity distribution which allows - together with the vector point diagram - to discriminate between members and non members .",
    "we find that @xmath1 = -3.5@xmath21.0 km / sec , and a radial velocity dispersion of 2.4 km / sec .",
    "+    once members have been selected , we build up their color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , which is presented in fig .  3 ( left panel ) .",
    "the cluster exhibits a clear main sequence ( ms ) , which are nicely fit by a solar abundance 500 myr isochrone from the padova group ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) . from this fit",
    "we derive an absolute distance modulus @xmath3 = 8.25@xmath20.16 and a reddening e@xmath4 = 0.06@xmath20.03 , in agreement with previous study .",
    "our spectra are single epoch spectra , and therefore we are not able to derive a binary fraction estimate , which would be quite an important constrain for @xmath0-body models .",
    "second epoch observations are however planned . nonetheless , by inspecting the cmd",
    ", we can argue that two stars off the main sequence at v @xmath5 11 might be actually binaries .",
    "+ the present day mass function ( pdmf ) is not the salpeter anymore , but ( see fig .  3 , right panel )",
    "it is a power law with a slope amounting at -1.6 ( solid line ) .",
    "noticeably , there is a significant lack of low mass stars with respect to the salpeter mf ( dashed line ) .",
    "+ the comparison with available @xmath0-body models of clusters evolution and dissolution ( de la fuente marcos 1997 ) leads us to conclude that the initial population of the clusters was around 500 stars .",
    "in fact such an initial models after half a billion years should have 15 members , exactly like ngc  1901 .",
    "+ work is in progress to secure membership definition for a number of pocrs on a radial velocity basis ( villanova 2003 , villanova et al . 2003 ) .",
