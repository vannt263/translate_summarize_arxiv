    "the idea that large scale magnetic fields could exist in the early universe is both appealing and plausible @xcite .",
    "it was noticed long ago that if magnetic fields existed in the early universe , they could have affected ( or possibly explained ) various stages of the formation of cosmic structures @xcite .",
    "long range stochastic fields can modify the rate of the universe expansion and the reaction rate at the nucleosynthesis epoch @xcite .",
    "stochastic fields coherent over the horizon size at the decoupling time can depolarise the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , and can also change the sound velocity of the plasma at the corresponding era @xcite .    if the temperature of the radiation - dominated universe is higher than the temperature of the electroweak phase transition ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , then the large scale components of the standard model gauge fields should be identified with the hypermagnetic fields @xcite which , by contributing to the ( abelian ) anomaly , can generate matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations @xcite ( possibly relevant in the context of the inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis scenario @xcite ) .",
    "long range hypermagnetic fields can also influence the dynamics of the phase transition itself @xcite .",
    "interesting consequences of the presence of electroweak condensates for the gravitational wave spectra were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "stochastically distributed magnetic fields ( either amplified from their vacuum fluctuations @xcite through the breaking of the conformal invariance of maxwell equations or just assumed @xcite ) can imprint inhomogeneities in the microwave sky .",
    "long ago it was argued that any uniform ( spatially homogeneous ) magnetic fields can make the energy momentum tensor of a radiation dominated universe slightly anisotropic producing , ultimately , an observable effect in the microwave sky @xcite .",
    "recently bounds were derived ( using the cobe 4-yrs maps ) on the present strength of a uniform ( and homogeneous ) magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will argue that , on the basis of the physical laws governing the evolution of the mean magnetic fields in a hot plasma , there are no reasons why the topology of the magnetic flux lines should be _ trivial _ , namely there are no reasons why the magnetic flux lines should not intersect each others .",
    "if the topology of the magnetic flux lines is non trivial , then , the helicity of a specific magnetic configuration will also enter in the equations describing evolution of the scalar , vector and tensor fluctuations of the metric in a radiation dominated universe . provided",
    "the typical scale of the knot ( red - shifted at the recombination time ) is much smaller that the magnetic jeans scale at the corresponding epoch , very little impact can be expected for structure formation @xcite .    in short",
    "our logic is the following .",
    "one of the main features of the evolution equations of the mean magnetic fields ( for scales larger than the debye radius ) in highly conducting ( and globally neutral ) plasmas is that they are divergence - less ( i.e. the field lines have no end points ) and , therefore , the structures arising in magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) can be examined in terms of the topology of closed curves @xcite .",
    "now , it is well known that in ( ideal ) mhd a unique and intriguing property holds : the _ magnetic flux _ and _ magnetic helicity _ are simultaneously conserved all along the evolution of the plasma for scales larger than the magnetic diffusivity scale . since the universe is a good conductor all along its history , we have to conclude that , on one hand , thanks to the magnetic flux conservation , the magnetic flux lines always evolve glued together with the plasma element and , on the other hand , thanks to the magnetic helicity conservation , the sum of the number of _ twists _ and the number of _ knots _ in the flux lines is also left invariant @xcite as time goes by . at this point",
    "the choice is twofold .",
    "either we assume ( as it is frequently done in the case of stochastic magnetic backgrounds @xcite ) that the ( mean ) magnetic helicity is strictly zero , or we accept that the magnetic helicity can be present and , in this last case , it will be conserved to a very good approximation .",
    "as we said , a non - vanishing magnetic helicity implies that the corresponding magnetic field configurations must be inhomogeneous ( otherwise the integral defining the magnetic helicity can not be gauge - invariant ) .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we are forced to deal with inhomogeneous fields . at the same time",
    "one could say that inhomogeneous configurations carrying zero ( net ) magnetic helicity can also have interesting effects on the gravitational wave production .",
    "this is certainly true and one of the purposes of the present investigation is to understand , with some specific examples , what difference does it make to drop the ( oversimplifying ) assumption that the magnetic flux lines of the cosmological magnetic fields have all trivial topological structure .",
    "inhomogeneous magnetic knots are expected to affect various aspects of the life of our universe .",
    "they can represent a quite interesting source `` seed '' in the evolution of metric density perturbations during radiation ( and possibly matter ) dominated epochs . since magnetic knot configurations with finite energy and helicity are necessarily inhomogeneous , no homogeneous and isotropic ( background ) contribution is expected from the knot energy - momentum tensor . at the same time",
    ", the presence of magnetic knots and twists in the magnetic flux lines does modify the evolution equations of the metric fluctuations .",
    "the spatial components of the knot energy - momentum tensor form a three - dimensional rank two ( cartesian ) tensor which can be decomposed into irreducible scalar ( invariant under three dimensional rotations ) , vector and tensor parts providing source terms for the evolution equations of the corresponding scalar vector and tensor parts of the metric inhomogeneities .",
    "the tensor modes of the metric are automatically invariant under infinitesimal coordinate ( gauge ) transformations @xcite .",
    "the components of the knot energy - momentum tensor are also invariant under infinitesimal coordinate transformations because of the absence of any ( homogeneous and isotropic ) magnetic background .",
    "we want to notice immediately that , one of the main ideas of our investigation is the connection among knot seeds and metric fluctuations . up to",
    "now all the investigations on the existence of large scale magnetic fields were mainly devoted to the study of suitable mechanisms able to explain the large scale  magnetic \" structure of the universe , or more specifically , the existence of galactic ( and possibly inter - galactic ) magnetic fields @xcite . in our study",
    "we point out that , if the conservation properties arising in mhd are properly taken into account , then , interesting effects can be foreseen also for the metric fluctuations .    in the first place we would like to motivate magnetic knots configurations on the basis of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the idea of magnetic knots might seem , at first sight , a crazy one . in order to make this idea quantitatively plausible",
    "we will introduce some explicit mhd solutions describing magnetic knots .",
    "it is very important that these field configurations are regular over the whole space , they have finite energy and helicity .",
    "they represent then a good framework where the effect of magnetic knots on the metric inhomogeneities can be discussed .",
    "the fact that our configurations have finite energy ( as also required by considerations related to the @xmath3 gauge invariance of the magnetic helicity ) implies that the amplitude of the magnetic fields tends to zero for scales larger than the scale of the configuration @xmath4 . for the discussion of the magnetic helicity evolution in a radiation dominated stage of expansion",
    "an important tool will be the conformal invariance of the ( ideal ) mhd equations .",
    "moreover , since we want our mhd description to be fully valid we will also consider times larger than the epoch of electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the second purpose of this investigation are the possible phenomenological consequences of the existence of magnetic knots prior to the decoupling time .",
    "we will show that spikes in the gravitational waves energy spectrum @xcite can be foreseen and we will compare our results with the typical amplitudes of gravitational waves produced in the context of inflationary models .",
    "the amplitude of the  magnetic \" spikes depends directly upon the helicity of our configuration and turns out to be substantially larger than the signal of a stochastic gravitational wave background with flat ( harrison - zeldovich ) logarithmic energy spectrum which represents a generic prediction of ordinary inflationary models .",
    "the  magnetic spikes \" in the gravitational wave spectrum are not constrained by pulsars s pulses since they are expected to occur in a ( present ) frequency range @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in principle",
    "we could also expect interesting effects from the lorentz force term associated with the knot configuration and appearing in the euler ( navier - stokes ) equation for the density field @xcite which goes , in mhd , as @xmath8 .",
    "the calculation shows that , since the knot scale is just slightly smaller than the magnetic jeans scale at the decoupling , effects on structure formation are expected to be mild .",
    "the plan of our paper is then the following . in sec .",
    "ii we will recall the basic equations and definitions with particular attention to the alfvn theorem and to the magnetic helicity theorem . in sec .",
    "iii we will introduce the class of configurations with finite energy and helicity . in sec .",

    "v we will focus our attention on the problem of magnetic spikes in the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "section vi contains our concluding remarks .",
    "we made the choice of including in the appendix different technical results which might be of help for the interested reader .",
    "the set of mhd equations can be studied with different `` closures '' .",
    "some usual closures @xcite are the incompressibility ( i.e. @xmath31 ) and the adiabaticity , but other closures can be invented depending upon the problem at hand ( like the isothermal closure or the closure @xmath32 ) . since the evolution of the universe can be described ( within the hot big - bang model ) by an adiabatic expansion",
    ", we can certainly require that @xmath33 and that @xmath34 .",
    "moreover one can also assume that the fluid is incompressible and in this case , not only the magnetic lines will be divergence - less but also the velocity lines will share the same property .",
    "we notice , incidentally , that in the incompressible approximation we can also define a hydrodynamical helicity @xcite which allows the topological treatment also for the hydrodynamical part of the system . at the end of sec . iv we will specifically consider a case where the incompressible closure is relaxed .    in referring the reader to appendix a for further details concerning the mhd evolution we want only to note that at high conductivity the alfvn theorem holds @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary closed surface which moves together with the plasma .",
    "if we are in the inertial regime ( i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the magnetic diffusivity length ) , we can say that the expression appearing at the right hand side is subleading and the magnetic flux lines evolve glued to the plasma element .",
    "moreover , the magnetic helicity @xmath39 is conserved in the inertial range : @xmath40 concerning eqs .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) two comments are in order . in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) the vector potential appears and , therefore it might seem that the expression is not gauge invariant .",

    "calling @xmath45 is the unit vector normal to @xmath46 , the integral defining the magnetic helicity is gauge invariant provided @xmath47 in @xmath44 .",
    "as we will consider finite energy fields in our examples of section iii we will have that @xmath48 in any part of @xmath44 ( which might be a closed surface at infinity ) . in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) the term appearing under integration at the right hand side ( i.e. @xmath49 ) is sometimes called also magnetic helicity ( or magnetic gyrotropy ) and it is a gauge invariant measure of the diffusion rate of @xmath39 at finite conductivity .",

    "( [ flux])([h2 ] ) are reviewed and proven in appendix a.    notice that eqs .",
    "( [ flux ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) are truly dynamical symmetries of the plasma , in the sense that they are not inherent to static mhd configurations . before ending this section",
    "we want to mention a further scale which turns out to be important in the discussion of the large scale effects of primordial magnetic fields , namely the magnetic jeans scale @xcite . at @xmath50",
