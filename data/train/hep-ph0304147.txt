    "at this point there is no direct evidence for supersymmetry .",
    "nevertheless supersymmetry is such a beautiful symmetry and provides such elegant solutions to a host of theoretical problems  @xcite that many believe that it must be present in nature .",
    "it is a pressing experimental issue to see if nature takes advantage of this elegant option . of course",
    ", we already know that supersymmetry is rather badly broken , since we do not see any superpartners for the particles of the standard model .",
    "it is assumed that all of the superpartners are in fact very heavy and that we will see them as we go to higher energies in accelerators .",
    "it is therefore extremely interesting to investigate what the properties of supersymmetric bound states might look like .",
    "there are indications that some unusual things can happen in a theory with supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we present here the solution of an @xmath0 super yang",
    " mills ( sym ) theory with fundamental matter in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we also add a chern  simons ( cs ) term to give the adjoint matter a mass .",
    "there are several motivations to look at ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models .",
    "t hooft  @xcite showed long ago that two - dimensional models can be powerful laboratories for the study of the bound - state problem .",
    "these models remain popular to this day because they are easy to solve and share many properties with their four - dimensional cousins , most notably stable bound states .",
    "supersymmetric two - dimensional models are particularly attractive , since they are also super - renormalizable .",
    "given that the dynamics of the gauge field is responsible for the strong interaction and for the formation of bound states , it comes as no surprise that a great deal of effort has gone into the investigation of bound states of pure glue in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "extensive study of the meson spectrum of non - supersymmetric theories has been done ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently an initial study addressed some of these states in the context of supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these reasons for studying ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models , we are also interested in investigating them as the first step toward solving ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models .",
    "a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model can be much more realistic , since it includes some transverse dynamics .",
    "currently there are several numerical approaches to solving field theories . for qcd - like theories ,",
    "lattice gauge theory is probably the most popular approach , since the lattice approximation does not break the most important symmetry , gauge symmetry .",
    "similarly for supersymmetric theories , supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ( sdlcq )  @xcite is probably the most powerful approach since the discretization does not break the most important symmetry , supersymmetry  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider supersymmetric theories and follow this latter approach . to simplify the calculation",
    "we will consider only the large-@xmath1 limit  @xcite , which has proven to be a powerful approximation for bound - state calculations .",
    "while baryons can be constructed in this limit  @xcite , they have an infinite number of partons , and thus practical calculations for such states are complicated .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the word `` meson '' to indicate the group structure of the state .",
    "namely , we define a meson as a bound state whose wave function can be written as a linear combination of parton chains , each chain starting and ending with a creation operator in the fundamental representation . in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "the states defined this way can have either bosonic or fermionic statistics .",
    "previously we saw that the lightest bound states in @xmath0 supersymmetric theories are very interesting  @xcite . in sym theories in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions , the lightest bound states in the spectrum are massless bogomolnyi ",
    " sommerfield ( bps ) bound states  @xcite .",
    "these states are exactly massless at all couplings .",
    "when we add a cs term to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional sym theory , which gives a mass to the constituents , we find approximate bps states .",
    "the masses of these states are approximately independent of the coupling , and at strong coupling these states are the lightest bound states in the theory  @xcite . in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional sym - cs theory we also find that at strong coupling there are anomalously light bound states  @xcite . in both 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 dimensions , these interesting states appear because of the exact bps symmetry in the underlying sym theory .",
    "we have also looked at the lightest bound states of sym - cs theory with fundamental matter  @xcite .",
    "again we see that the lightest bound states are significantly lighter than one would have naively expected .",
    "we found that the lightest state is nearly massless and well below threshold .",
    "we will see that this model has a number of interesting bound states in addition to the lowest mass state that we studied previously  @xcite .",
    "the bound states separate into two bands , a low - mass band and a high - mass band .",
    "interestingly the low mass permits two solutions for bound states .",
    "the preferred solution has an unusual oscillatory convergence .",
    "some of the states in the low - mass band are very light and well below threshold .",
    "the upper band has the standard linear convergence . in both bands , some of the states are nearly pure quark - gluon states , and some are nearly pure squark and gluons .",
    "some have structure functions that are very sharply peaked at small longitudinal momentum fractions , and some have several of these properties .    throughout this paper",
    "we completely ignore the zero - mode problem  @xcite ; however , it is clear that considerable progress on this issue could be made following our earlier work on the zero modes of the two - dimensional supersymmetric model with only adjoint fields  @xcite .",
    "the paper has the following organization . in sec .",
    "[ sectdefin ] we consider three - dimensional supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) with a cs term and dimensionally reduce it to 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we perform the light - cone quantization of the resulting theory by applying canonical commutation relations at fixed @xmath3 and choosing the light - cone gauge ( @xmath4 ) for the vector field . after solving the constraint equations ,",
    "we obtain a model containing four dynamical fields .",
    "we construct the supercharge for this dimensionally reduced theory . in sec .",
    "[ secmesons ] we discuss the structure of the lighter meson bound states in the large-@xmath1 approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : supercs ] we discuss the addition of a cs term to the supercharge  @xcite .",

    "[ secnum ] we discuss the bound - state solutions that we find , including the mass spectrum , structure functions and the numerical convergence of the various bound states . in sec .",
    "[ secdis ] we discuss our results and the future directions that are indicated by this research .",
    "we consider the supersymmetric models in two dimensions which can be obtained as the result of dimensional reduction of sqcd@xmath5 .",
    "our starting point is the three - dimensional action [ action ] s&=&d^3x(-f_f^+ ^d_+d_^d^+ i| d_^. + & & -.g ) .",
    "this action describes a system of a gauge field @xmath6 , representing gluons , and its superpartner @xmath7 , representing gluinos , both taking values in the adjoint representation of @xmath8 , and two complex fields , a scalar @xmath9 representing squarks and a dirac fermion @xmath10 representing quarks , transforming according to the fundamental representation of the same group . in matrix notation",
    "the covariant derivatives are given by d_=_+ig[a_,],d_=_+iga_,d_=_+iga_. the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under the following supersymmetry transformations , which are parameterized by a two - component majorana fermion @xmath11 : & & a_=_,=f_^ , + & & = , = -^d_. using standard techniques one can construct the noether current corresponding to these transformations as [ sucurrent ] |q^&=&^ ^(f_)+ d^^+^^ d _ + & & -d^+d_^. we will consider the reduction of this system to two dimensions , which means that the field configurations are assumed to be independent of the transverse coordinate @xmath12 . in the resulting two - dimensional system we will implement light - cone quantization , where the initial conditions as well as canonical commutation relations are imposed on a light - like surface @xmath13 . in particular , we construct the supercharge by integrating the current ( [ sucurrent ] ) over the light - like surface to obtain [ sucharge ] |q&=&dx^-dx^2 ( ^ ^+(f_)+ d_-^+^^+ d_. + & & -.d^++d_^+ ) .",
    "since all fields are assumed to be independent of @xmath12 , the integration over this coordinate gives just a constant factor , which we absorb by a field redefinition .",
    "if we use the following specific representation for the dirac matrices in three dimensions : ^0=_2,^1=i_1,^2=i_3 , the majorana fermion @xmath7 can be chosen to be real .",
    "it is also convenient to write the fermion fields and the supercharge in component form as = ( , ) ^t,=(,)^t , q=(q^+,q^-)^t . in terms of this decomposition",
    "the superalgebra has an explicit @xmath14 form [ sualg ] \\{q^+,q^+}=2p^+,\\{q^-,q^-}=2p^-,\\{q^+,q^-}=0 .",
    "the sdlcq method exploits this superalgebra by constructing @xmath15 from a discrete approximation to @xmath16  @xcite , rather than directly discretizing @xmath15 , as is done in ordinary dlcq  @xcite .    to begin to eliminate nondynamical fields",
    ", we impose the light - cone gauge ( @xmath4 ) . then the supercharges are given by [ qplus ] q^+&=&2dx^-(_-a^2 + _",
    "-^-^_-- ^_-+_-^ ) , + q^-&=&-2dx^-(-_-a^-+ i^d_2-id_2^+ _ -(^-^ ) ) .",
    "+ note that apart from a total derivative these expressions involve only left - moving components of the fermions ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "in fact , in the light - cone formulation only these components are dynamical .",
    "to see this we consider the equations of motion that follow from the action ( [ action ] ) , in light - cone gauge .",

    "@xmath20 , we apply the methods of sdlcq .",
    "namely we compactify the two - dimensional theory on a light - like circle ( @xmath21 ) , and impose periodic boundary conditions on all physical fields .",
    "this leads to the following mode expansions : [ expanda2 ] a^2_ij(0,x^-)&=&_k=1^ ( a_ij(k)e^-ikx^-/l+a^_ji(k)e^ikx^-/l ) , + [ expandlambda ] _",

    "we will consider here only meson - like states . in the large-@xmath1 approximation these are color - singlet states with exactly two partons in the fundamental representation .",
    "the boson bound states will have either two bosons or two fermions in the fundamental representation .",

    "we will have to consider only a single ( s)quark  anti-(s)quark pair .",
    "thus the fock space is constructed from states of the following type : [ state ] |f^_i_1(k_1 ) a^_i_1i_2(k_2)  b^_i_ni_n+1(k_n-1)  f^_i_p(k_n)|0 . here",

    "the other color - singlet bound states in this theory are states that are composed of traces of only adjoint mesons .",
    "these can be considered to be loops . at finite",
    "@xmath1 this theory has interactions that break these loops and insert a pair of fundamental partons , making an open - string state .",
    "this type of interaction can , of course , also form loops from open strings and break one open string into two open strings . in principle , a calculation of the spectrum of such a finite-@xmath1 theory is within the reach of sdlcq .",
    "the only significant change is to include states in the basis with more than one color trace .",
    "the cs term we use in this calculation is obtained by starting with a cs term in 2 + 1 dimensions and reducing it to 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this term has the effect of adding a mass for the adjoint partons . in this calculation",
    "we are including fundamental matter because we are interested in qcd - like meson bound states . without a mass for the adjoint matter ,",
    "this theory is known to produce very long light chains of adjoint partons . in a finite-@xmath1 calculation",
    "we would not have these very long chains because they would break , but in the large-@xmath1 approximation they do not . while sdlcq can be used to do finite-@xmath1 calculations , it is much easier to add a mass to restrict the number of adjoint partons in our bound states .",
    "we choose the cs mechanism to give the adjoint partons a mass because we can do this without breaking the supersymmetry .",
    "the lagrangian of this theory is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sqcd lagrangian we discussed earlier , @xmath40 is the cs coupling , and @xmath41 a trace of the color matrices is understood .",
    "the constraint equation ( [ fcurrent ] ) gains a third term of the form @xmath42 on the right - hand side , and the definition of the current in ( [ current ] ) now has an additional term , @xmath43 .",
    "the discrete version of the cs part of the supercharge in 1 + 1 dimensions is @xmath44 it is informative to compare @xmath45 with the one term in the supercharge for sym in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite which has an explicit dependence on the transverse momentum @xmath46 .",
    "this @xmath46-dependent term has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the discrete transverse momentum .",
    "notice that @xmath46 and @xmath40 enter the supercharge in very similar ways .",
    "addition of a cs term has the effect of changing @xmath46 to @xmath49 .",
    "because the light - cone energy is of the form @xmath50 , @xmath46 behaves like a mass , and therefore @xmath40 also behaves in many ways like a mass for the adjoint particles .",
    "the partons in the fundamental representation in this theory will remain massless .",
    "of course , in a more physical theory the supersymmetry would be badly broken ; the squark would acquire a large mass , and only the quarks would remain nearly massless .",
    "this sym - cs theory with fundamental matter has two dimensionful parameters with dimension of a mass squared , the ym coupling squared @xmath51 and the cs coupling squared @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is also the mass squared of the partons in the adjoint representation .",
    "all of the masses in this paper will be given in units of @xmath53 , which will usually be suppressed .",
    "furthermore , we are only considering meson bound states .",
    "these are states of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) with two fundamental partons linked by partons in the adjoint representation .",
    "since we are working in the large-@xmath1 approximation , this class of states is disconnected from the other allowed class of pure adjoint matter bound states and multiparticle states .",
    "this theory also has a @xmath54 symmetry  @xcite which is very useful in labeling the states and reducing the dimension of the fock basis that one has to consider in any one diagonalization step .",
    "for this theory the @xmath54 symmetry divides the basis into states with an even or odd number of gluons .",
    "we find that the spectra of meson bound states , for both odd and even @xmath54 symmetry , divides into two bands of states as we increase @xmath40 , a light - mass band and a heavy - mass band , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) .",
    "as @xmath40 grows , a gap develops in the spectrum .",
    "this mass gap reflects in part the number of massive adjoint partons in the bound states . at very large @xmath40 ,",
    "the low - mass band will comprise states with only fundamental partons .",
    "we will look at the bound states in both bands and consider various values of @xmath40 relative to @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) we see that at @xmath56 this gap grows with the coupling .",
    "the lowest mass state remains very light even for values of @xmath55 up to 2 .",
    "as far as we can tell , this state remains very light even at very large couplings .",

    "in this paper we studied @xmath0 sym - cs theory with fundamental matter in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the cs term was included to give masses to the adjoint partons .",
    "the calculations were performed at large @xmath1 in the framework of sdlcq ; namely , we compactified the light - like coordinate @xmath57 on a finite circle and calculated the hamiltonian as the square of a supercharge @xmath16 , which we then diagonalized numerically .",
    "we found that the spectrum of this theory has two bands , a lower mass band and an upper mass band . with a cs term present",
    ", we found that these bands separate for @xmath58 , and we can easily study them separately .    for very massive adjoint partons , the lower mass band becomes a set of massless bound states composed of only fundamental partons .",
    "when the mass for the adjoint partons is reduced , the massless states become the states of the lower mass band .",
    "the states in the low - mass band are unusual in that their convergence is oscillatory .",
    "we show that the upper and lower bounds of the low - mass band have the same shape as the dlcq approximation to the two - particle free spectrum , which has an oscillatory behavior for its lower bound and a growing upper bound .",
    "we argue therefore that the oscillatory behavior is a numerical remnant of the free two - particle spectrum . in previous work",
    "@xcite we found that at @xmath59 the lowest mass state of this theory was anomalously low , and in fact close to zero , while threshold for this state is at @xmath60 . on average",
    "this state has one massive gluon and two squarks .",
    "this is the fifth supersymmetric theory where we have found anomalously light states . in sym in 1 + 1  @xcite and 2 + 1  @xcite dimensions , there are massless bps states . in sym - cs theory in 1 + 1 dimensions we saw that at strong coupling the lightest states are approximately bps states whose masses are independent of the ym coupling  @xcite . in sym - cs theories in 2 + 1 dimensions at strong coupling , there is again an anomalously light bound state  @xcite .",
    "the next lightest state in this band has about four partons .",
    "we carry the calculation to resolution @xmath61 , so in principle these states could contain 13 partons .",
    "in addition , almost all of the partons in the adjoint representation are gluons rather than gluinos . also , the content of the particles in the fundamental representation is rather pure , either squarks or quarks .",
    "thus some of the boson bound states are rather pure combinations of quarks and glue , in spite of the fact that they are bound states of an exactly supersymmetric theory .",
    "the bound states in the upper mass band are rather conventional sdlcq bound states .",
    "they converge very quickly and have the conventional linear behavior in @xmath62 .",
    "similar to the lower mass band , most of the partons in the adjoint representation are gluons .",
    "in addition , the states are again rather pure quark or squark states .",
    "when we take the adjoint parton mass large , these are the states that have at least one adjoint parton .",
    "we calculate the structure functions of the states in both bands for all four species of partons , and we find that most of the distributions are strongly peaked at @xmath63 near zero .",
    "this is an indication that for @xmath64 these are strongly coupled bound states . in a weakly coupled bound state",
    "one would , on average , expect the partons to share the momentum fraction equally , and therefore the structure function would be peaked at 1/3 for a state with three partons , for example . since several of the states we consider are almost pure quark - gluon bound states , they might not be affected by supersymmetry breaking , which would give large mass to the squarks and gluinos .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate in more detail the properties of these states and compare them with qcd .",
    "there remains a considerable amount of work to be done on sym - cs theories with fundamental matter .",
    "the most straightforward extension of the present work is to consider calculations in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theory in 2 + 1 dimensions is easily within our reach . beyond that the @xmath65 theory  @xcite in 2 + 1 dimensions , which is the dimensional reduction of the @xmath0 theory in 3 + 1 dimensions , will be very interesting .",
    "for finite @xmath1 we could also look at the mixing of closed - loop states and finite string - like meson states . for @xmath66",
