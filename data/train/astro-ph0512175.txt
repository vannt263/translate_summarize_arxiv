    "the large new galaxy surveys such as 2df @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite have transformed the way we can study galaxy properties statistically . here",
    "we focus on a sample of elliptical galaxies derived from those selected from the sdss by @xcite ( hereafter b03 ) .",
    "our motivation is to revisit fundamental issues of galaxy formation from the perspective afforded by a modern data set .",
    "a theory of galaxy formation in a universe dominated by cold dark matter was first set out in a seminal paper by blumenthal , faber , primack & rees ( 1986a ) ( hereinafter bfpr ) which considers the monolithic collapse of isolated dark matter halos . according to this picture ,",
    "the redshift at which a halo collapses is determined only by its mass , for a given cosmology and choice of amplitude of fluctuation .",
    "the baryons follow the dark matter distribution until the radius of the collapsing halo reaches the virial radius and is halted .",
    "studies of the evolution of the fluctuations in density , however , suggest that galaxy formation is dominated by merging of small dark matter halos @xcite , and this picture is supported by simulations @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to discriminate between these two pictures of the formation of galaxies , referred to respectively as monolithic or spherical collapse and hierarchical merging .",
    "simulation results notwithstanding , the small scatter of the observed colour magnitude relation and its evolution with redshift provides evidence that massive ellipticals were already in place at a redshift of @xmath3 with little subsequent merging ( e.g. @xcite ) , whereas less massive ellipticals present features characteristic of recent star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this ` inverted hierarchy ' or ` downsizing ' effect @xcite illustrates the complexity of galaxy formation compared with a simple picture of the assembly of dark matter halos . in this paper",
    "we use the predictions of the spherical collapse scenario as a benchmark , which can then be challenged with further comparisons with observations and detailed simulations .",
    "a new aspect of our analysis is the estimation of the stellar mass of each of the b03 ellipticals , allowing us to distinguish between baryonic and total mass .",
    "we also update the calculations of bfpr for ` concordance cosmology ' ( matter density @xmath4,dark energy density @xmath5,hubble constant @xmath6 and amplitude of fluctuations @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 .",
    "however , @xmath7 is still preferred by weak lensing . ] and place the observed ellipticals on a revised cooling diagram . despite the attention bfpr",
    "has received , this relatively simple generalization to @xmath0cdm has not previously appeared in the literature .",
    "our analysis of the b03 galaxies also appears to be the first attempt to incorporate data for individual galaxies ( as opposed to schematic data ) in this parameter space . from the first three years of wmap observations of the cosmic microwave background alone ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    ", we use a ` cosmological ' baryon fraction of 1/6 unless otherwise stated .    on galactic scales , @xcite model the milky way within the virial radius ( @xmath11 kpc ) and find that a substantial ` feedback ' mechanism which removes baryons from the galaxy itself must have operated . do similar processes operate in massive ellipticals ?",
    "are their cores dominated by baryonic matter ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have reached conflicting conclusions to this important question , based on the analysis of planetary nebul  in elliptical galaxies out to five times the effective radius @xmath12 . by using the central velocity dispersion and stellar mass out to @xmath12 we seek to answer the same question by focussing on the central region only .",
    "we find that the cores of the galaxies are baryon dominated , at least to a distance of @xmath12 from the centre .    by making the straightforward assumption that the total mass of the galaxy is proportional to the mass of the galaxy ` cores ' we have studied ,",
    "we reproduce the bfpr results for a modern ` concordance ' cosmology , and investigate the regime in which their benchmark model of spherical collapse is consistent with the data .",
    "we also recover the profile of the undisturbed dark matter halo from present - day observables via the procedure of adiabatic contraction , which enables us to compare our derived profile concentration with both simulations and observations . defining @xmath13/@xmath14 - the total mass of the collapsing halo divided by the dynamical mass within @xmath12 ",
    "we find a strong constraint that @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 provides a good fit to the data .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents the b03 sample and a volume - limited subset of 2040 galaxies selected from it .",
    "section 3 describes the derivation of stellar masses of these ellipticals from the sdss colours .",
    "section 4 derives dynamical masses and section 5 covers the relations between luminosity , velocity dispersion , stellar mass and dynamical mass , extending the classic @xcite relation . in section 6 we comment on the acceleration of stars in the ellipticals and the connection to mond .",
    "section 7 extends the benchmark spherical collapse model for the concordance @xmath0-cdm cosmology and use it to contrast the observed ellipticals with the level of rms fluctuations on the cooling diagram .",
    "finally , in section 8 we present a new reconstruction method which recovers the initial halo of dark matter from the present - day observables using the adiabatic contraction .",
    "we summarize the results and outline future work in section 9 .",
    "we use galaxies selected from the sample of @xcite extracted from the sdss .",
    "the sample comprises almost 9,000 early - type galaxies , with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath17 ( in the heliocentric reference frame ) . in b03 ,",
    "the authors describe the selection criteria for their sample and the catalogue itself ; as the photometry in each of the bands is used in our subsequent analysis , it is important to note that these criteria do not include selection by colour .",
    "their sample is magnitude - limited with all galaxies at a redshift of @xmath18 excluded . for the work presented in this paper we have used the data as presented in b03 , with the exception of photometry where we have used the recent sloan data release 4 , @xcite which resolves many of the problems with photometry identified in earlier releases .    unlike the work presented in b03 and its companion papers , we have further restricted the sample to provide a volume - limited sample .",
    "the mass function of the subset of galaxies selected by b03 , with @xmath19 and absolute magnitude in the r - band @xmath20 , is shown in figure [ fig : massfunc ] .",
    "as the figure shows , restricting our sample to massive elipticals , with @xmath21 produces a volume limited sample of 2040 galaxies with @xmath19 which appears free from selection effects . unless otherwise stated , this is the sample we use for subsequent results .",
    "the definition of stellar mass , as shown in the figure , is given in the next section .",
    "for massive elliptical galaxies with little gas content , the baryonic mass is approximately equal to the stellar mass at least within the effective radius , @xmath12 .",
    "we compute the stellar mass content within the effective radius by comparing the available sdss photometry with a wide range of star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "we assume an exponentially decaying star formation rate , so that each sfh is uniquely defined by three parameters : stellar metallicity ( constant with time ) , star formation timescale and formation redshift ( allowed in the range @xmath22 ) .",
    "these models can represent either a short , sharp burst of star formation or a more extended episode . for every choice of sfh",
    "we calculate the resulting synthetic stellar populations of @xcite , generating a composite spectrum .",
    "a @xcite initial mass function is used throughout .",
    "we use four sdss passbands to compare the flux in each of three colours ( @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 ) with the observations of each source .",
    "the best fit is used to determine the stellar mass - to - light ratio which allows us to estimate the stellar mass content of each source from the absolute @xmath26-band magnitudes given in data release  4 .",
    "it seems initially that the use of the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) would produce a stellar mass content which might be more accurate .",
    "however , we must emphasize that our results indicate that the stellar mass to light ratio in the @xmath26 band does not change much with respect to the star formation histories allowed in early - type galaxies .",
    "all photo - spectroscopic observables of local early - type galaxies correspond to old , passively evolving stellar populations @xcite , which results in a very weak dependence of the m / l for the allowed ages and metallicities ( see the right hand panel of figure [ fig : masstolight ] ) .",
    "the largest systematic error in the stellar mass is due to the choice of the initial mass function ( imf ) , which amounts to a factor @xmath27  dex in @xmath28 for a range of standard imfs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we can use the projected size and central velocity dispersion along with a simple model of the dynamics of early - type galaxies to estimate the total matter content . assuming that the velocity dispersion and the anisotropy of the velocity distribution do not vary with radius",
    ", one can solve jeans equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) perform a careful analysis of the profiles of massive galaxies and find that    @xmath29    where @xmath12 is the effective ( or projected half - light ) radius , @xmath30 is the velocity dispersion as measured at the centre and a is a constant which depends weakly on the anisotropy of the velocity field .",
    "we adopt the padmanabhan value of @xmath31 throughout the present work , noting that they assume a systematic error of 30% .",
    "the dominant source of scatter is , as padmanabhan et al .",
    "note , measurement errors .",
    "figure [ fig : mdmldata ] presents a comparision of the dynamical mass and stellar mass .",
    "it is clear that dark matter is underabundant ( compared to the cosmological abundance ) in the central regions of these systems . in other words ,",
    "the core region is baryon dominated , in agreement with observations ( e.g. mamon & lokas 2005 ) .",
    "the slope is in agreement with independent estimates of total mass using strong gravitational lensing ( ferreras et al .",
    "2005 ) and suggests that dark matter is more important in massive galaxies .",
    "it also is comparable to the results of loewenstein and white ( 1999 ) , although they use an unrealistic model for anisotropy in their sources .",
    "romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) measure @xmath30 through observations of bright planetary nebul   in three local ellipticals and derive a mass to light ratio within @xmath32 compatible with those of purely stellar populations .",
    "dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) explain this result by suggesting that ` the stellar orbits in the outer regions  are very elongated ' .",
    "our results , derived for the innermost @xmath12 suggest that results similar to those obtained by romanowsky et al .",
    "would be expected even in large samples of ellipticals .",
    "in addition , realistic assumptions about the velocity strucutre of the cores of these systems do not provide an explanation of the deviation observed from the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "figure [ fig : msigdata ] shows the scaling relations of the ( @xmath26-band ) luminosity , stellar and dynamical mass as a function of velocity dispersion .",
    "the bottom panel shows the well - known faber - jackson relation @xcite .",
    "notice that the truncation imposed by the choice of a volume - limited sample results in a constraint nearly aligned with the correlation ( dashed line ) .",
    "hence , a strong bias is expected if we use this reduced sample for the fits ( see e.g. appendix b in lynden - bell et al .",
    "therefore we use the complete sample for the fits in this figure .    in order to reduce the effect of outliers in the calculation of the best fitting parameters , in common with all fits in this paper we use a robust m - estimator based on the minimisation of the mean absolute deviation ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , as standard least squares methods were found to be very sensitive to outliers in this sample .",
    "given the uncertainties in determining the errors in velocity dispersion and radius , we have chosen to weight all points equally rather than take into account their quoted errors .",
    "a bootstrap method is used to determine the uncertainty in the slope .",
    "the same fitting technique was applied on 1000 bootstrapped samples of 500 galaxies each .",
    "the predicted slopes from each run were used to determine the quoted uncertainties .",
    "the faber - jackson relation is a direct consequence of the dynamics of the systems being studied .",
    "early - type galaxies are hot dynamical systems whose support comes mostly from the velocity dispersion of the constituent stars .",
    "hence , a correlation is expected between the central velocity dispersion and the mass of the system . the different slope between stellar and dynamical mass estimates is mostly related to either stellar population effects , to structural differences , or to a significant correlation between the dark matter fractional contribution and total galaxy mass .",
    "this effect has been commonly invoked to explain the tilt of the observed so - called ` fundamental plane ' with respect to the prediction from the virial theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : masstolight ] shows the correlation between velocity dispersion and m / l ( stellar or total ) .",
    "local early - type galaxies are dominated by stars which are older than about @xmath33  gyr , which implies that the contribution of stellar populations to the tilt of the fundamental plane can not be too large , as previously suggested @xcite .",
    "there is a remarkable difference between stellar and dynamical m / l in figure  [ fig : masstolight ] .",
    "the fits were done using a bootstrap minimisation of the mean absolute deviation on the volume - limited sample .",
    "the slope of the dynamical m / l is sufficient to explain the tilt of the fundamental plane .",
    "notice that equation  [ eq : mdyn ] assumes homology for all galaxies .",
    "hence , we recover the tilt without invoking structural non - homology .",
    "furthermore , recent estimates using strong gravitational lensing @xcite suggest dark matter is the main cause of the tilt , a view supported by these results .",
    "our analysis so far has been done within the framework of newtonian dynamics .",
    "we showed that the cores ( i.e. within radius @xmath12 ) of massive early - type ellipticals are dominated by by baryons , rather than by dark matter .",
    "the alternative model of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) of @xcite suggests a modification to the acceleration if it is below @xmath34 .",
    "this modification can then explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies without the need for dark matter .",
    "it is intriguing indeed to see a correlation between the newtonian @xmath35 and the centrifugal acceleration @xmath36 at the last measured radial point @xmath26 in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "their points are reproduced in our figure 5 ( as circles ) .",
    "it is clear from the start that such low acceleration is not expected at the cores of ellipticals which have much smaller radii than the outer parts of spiral galaxies .",
    "however , it is interesting to look for any such correlation in the sample of ellipticals .",
    "figure 5 shows ( in dots ) the dynamical @xmath37 vs. the acceleration , defined as @xmath38 = @xmath39 .",
    "we see no obvious correlation and no continuity between the spirals and the ellipticals .",
    "as expected the ellipticals have accelerations which are @xmath40  times larger than that required by mond to show departure form the newtonian dynamics . if indeed ellipticals have large halos it would be an important test to measure the acceleration at these large radii .",
    "we have already mentioned the renewed interest in spherical collapse models as part of the complexity of galaxy formation .",
    "how do the predictions of this simple model compare to the modern data we have available , and how do the predictions change in a cosmological model incorporating a cosmological constant ?",
    "there have been many attempts to study spherical collapse in @xmath0cdm ( e.g. lahav et al .",
    "1991 ; wang & steinhardt 1998 ) but we will follow the analysis of bfpr more closely , using the velocity dispersion - mass and baryon density - temperature plots to compare the predictions of the model with data .    in order to check whether a simple spherical collapse model is compatible with the properties of massive galaxies , we show in figure [ fig : newmv ] the correlation between total mass ( i.e. including the halo ) and the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the lines represent the theoretical mass and velocity dispersion of dark matter haloes produced by monolithic collapse . the collapse of a spherical , top - hat , perturbation is described by :    @xmath41    where r is the radius in a fixed coordinate frame , @xmath42 is the mass enclosed within r and the initial velocity field is equivalent to the hubble flow only .",
    "if the mass described by such an equation is bound , it will expand initially before reaching a maximum radius and collapsing .",
    "linear theory predicts that the over - density at which the top hat collapses to a point is @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this value is appropriate for an einstein - de sitter universe , but the value is only slightly sensitive to the choice of cosmology .",
    "thus , for a top hat to be on the point of collapsing at a redshift @xmath44 , its density extrapolated to the present day must satisfy :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the growth factor from linear theory .",
    "collapse to a single point in this manner is prevented by violent relaxation ( ` phase mixing ' ) which produces a state of virial equilibrium .",
    "@xcite use the virial theorem to obtain the final over - density ( relative to the critical density at the collapse redshift ) for universes in which @xmath47 :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and    @xmath50    a halo will therefore collapse at a redshift , z , determined only by its total mass and by cosmology . via the virial theorem",
    "its radius will be given by :    @xmath51^{-\\frac{1}{3 } } & & \\nonumber \\\\ { } * \\left(\\frac{1+z}{10}\\right)^{-1}h^{-1 } \\mathrm{kpc}. & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a halo of given mass will collapse later in a universe with a non - zero cosmological constant , leading to the differences between the two sets of calculations presented here .",
    "the einstein - de sitter universe calculations were first presented by bfpr , and here we have updated their diagram to reflect a modern cosmological model together with data for individual galaxies which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been done before .    in order to compare with data ,",
    "it is necessary to convert the @xmath52 defined by equation [ eq : mdyn ] to a total mass .",
    "a naive solution would be to assume that @xmath53 but this ignores factors including variation in the mass to light ratio and the profile of the velocity dispersion .",
    "instead , we use the ansatz that the total mass of a galaxy will be proportional to the dynamical mass within @xmath12 :    @xmath54    there will exist a scatter in @xmath55 in the population of galaxies , and we may expect @xmath55 to be a function of the total mass of the galaxy . however , if we approximate by considering a single value of @xmath55 , we can then consider for what values of @xmath55 the spherical collapse model discussed above is appropriate .",
    "consider the example of @xmath56 , the naive value discussed above .",
    "the slope of the data is encouraging , being in good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "however , for a given mass , sigma is so large that the galaxies correspond to 4-sigma fluctuations in an eds model and a 7-sigma fluctuation in @xmath0cdm .",
    "these are extremely unlikely fluctuations , not compatible with the observed number density of massive galaxies .    in order to get a rough estimate for the level of fluctuations that correspond to massive galaxies",
    ", we use the morphologically segregated luminosity functions ( lfs ) from sdss ( nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ) . integrating the lf of e",
    "/ s0s from l@xmath57 to some bright upper limit , say 20l@xmath57 ( the choice does not matter given the exponential cutoff of the lf ) , we get a comoving number density of ellipticals similar to those in our sample ( see figure  [ fig : massfunc ] ) .",
    "the numbers from the sdss lf give @xmath58e / s0@xmath59mpc@xmath60 .",
    "a similar integral for the lf of _ all _ galaxies in the sample in the range @xmath61l / l@xmath62 gives the comoving number densities of galaxies , @xmath58all@xmath63mpc@xmath60 .",
    "the ratio of the two number densities ( @xmath58e / s0@xmath64all@xmath65 ) corresponds to a gaussian fluctuation around 2.5-sigma .",
    "hence , we can assume that a spherical collapse model from 2- to 3-sigma level fluctuations is compatible with the observed number density of early - type galaxies today .",
    "a choice of @xmath66 produces a good correlation between the data and the predicted m-@xmath30 relation for 3-sigma fluctuations given @xmath0cdm .",
    "it is interesting to note that this choice of @xmath55 produces a value for the stellar mass to total mass ratio which is approximately half the cosmological baryon fraction ; i.e. half the baryons in the halo are found in the form of stars .",
    "models with large @xmath55 are also consistent with the large mass to light ratios found by studies of massive ellipticals in x - rays @xcite .",
    "in order to further investigate the distributions of total and stellar mass within the spherical collapse framework , we need to take into account the evolution of the dark matter as the baryons dissipate energy and sink towards the center of the halo .",
    "we use the procedure of adiabatic contraction of the dark matter halo , following @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dark matter has an initial density profile of the form given by @xcite ( hereafter nfw ) .",
    "the concentration is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the virial radius  usually considered to be the edge of the halo  and @xmath69 is the scale radius .",
    "this method is strictly valid only for halo particles moving on circular orbits .",
    "@xcite show that the predicted density profile is more dense than that found in n - body simulations .",
    "however , the deviation is small @xcite and we use the method here as a first approximation .",
    "the initial mass profile and the final dark matter and baryonic profiles are related by two equations : @xmath70=r_im_i\\left(<r_i\\right),\\ ] ] @xmath71    @xmath72 is the initial mass enclosed within the radius , r . @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the final baryonic and dark matter profiles respectively .",
    "@xmath75 is the fraction of the system s mass which is contained in baryons which cool to form the galaxy , and is related to @xmath55 via the relation :    @xmath76    where the stellar mass within @xmath12 is assumed to be half the cooled baryonic mass ( @xcite ) . for @xmath66 and",
    "the ratio of @xmath77 to @xmath78 found in section [ sec : mdyn ] a value of @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to half the cosmological baryon fraction , which suggests that half the halo s baryons are in stars .",
    "we can also use this sort of argument to place a limit on @xmath55 by requiring @xmath801/6 ( where 1/6 is the cosmological baryon density ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "the baryons are assumed to have a density profile of the form given by @xcite ( which closely approximates the de vaucouleurs law , see  4 ) . in this case",
    "the adiabatic contraction problem can be solved analytically @xcite .",
    "each initial radius @xmath82 maps to a final radius @xmath26 given by : @xmath83m_i\\left(<r_i\\right)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the scale radius of the hernquist profile , and @xmath85 .",
    "a halo of mass @xmath86 in the monolithic picture considered here will collapse at a redshift determined only by the cosmology and the amplitude of perturbations .",
    "the virial radius is then given by equation [ eq : rvir ] .",
    "after choosing a value for @xmath55 , @xmath87 is given by equation [ eq : fcool ] using the value of @xmath88/@xmath14 for each galaxy .",
    "for any concentration , c , we then obtain the total mass inside the initial radius ( @xmath82 ) that will evolve into a final radius @xmath89 .",
    "the adiabatic contraction prescription implies this mass is equal to the final mass observed within @xmath12 .",
    "hence , we determine via a maximum likelihood estimator the concentration that satisfies @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig : c ] shows the histogram of the concentration of the _ initial _ dm halos for our sample , for 2 and 3-sigma perturbations and @xmath55 of 10 or 20 .",
    "the figure overlays a gaussian distribution corresponding to this result .",
    "the fit is remarkable : our simplistic model of spherical collapse and adiabatic contraction combined with a volume limited sample , results in a log - normal distribution of concentrations .",
    "this type of distribution is also obtained in more detailed n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion of our distribution is @xmath91 , in agreement with the simulations , which give @xmath92 ; notice that these simulations give values of concentration higher than those we find even for 2-sigma fluctuations .",
    "hierarchical models give concentrations around 4 only for objects which have recently undergone major mergers or for large ( galaxy cluster mass ) systems .",
    "the mean concentration for galaxies with mass @xmath93 is typically 13.1 ( wechsler et al . 2002 ) .    as figure",
    "[ fig : c ] shows , our model does reproduce large values of c for small values of @xmath55 and 2-@xmath30 fluctuations .",
    "however , a value @xmath94 would shift the data points in figure [ fig : newmv ] to the left , away from the predictions for 2- or 3-sigma fluctuations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the benchmark model predicts a mean concentration lower than that found in simulations .",
    "these results are reminiscent of those of @xcite , who studied the concentration of galaxy clusters and groups in the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "they found concentrations from the galaxy data which were a factor of @xmath952 lower than the predictions of dark matter simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , albeit on larger scales than those considered here .",
    "trujillo et al . ( 2006 ) present weak evidence for a change in concentration of massive elliptical galaxies ( as derived from the size - mass relation ) with redshift ; further studies with larger samples should enable us to test their results with our methods .      in order to consider the baryonic component of the galaxies , it is convenient to plot baryon number density against temperature , following bfpr . defining number density at present as :    @xmath96    and temperature as :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the mean atomic weight ( @xmath99 for a primordial mix of hydrogen and helium ) , and @xmath100 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : cool ] .",
    "the sample is shown in two different ways : the black dots are the actual baryon densities ( i.e. after adiabatic contraction ) using equation [ eq : nb ] , computed within the half - light radius .",
    "the grey dots represent baryon densities before adiabatic contraction , and are computed as the density corresponding to a baryon mass @xmath101 within a radius @xmath102 .",
    "the grey and black lines are predictions for the spherical collapse model ( @xmath0cdm ) , and are shown for 2 and 3-sigma fluctuations before and after adiabatic contraction .",
    "these models require a translation from total mass to baryon mass , for which we use the average value for @xmath75 obtained from the sample , i.e. @xmath103 . for the ` before ac ' ( grey ) lines we use this mass and the virial radius definied by equation [ eq : rvir ] .",
    "incidentally , we notice that the early - type galaxies indicated in the original cooling diagram in bfpr corresponds to our set of points before ac .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time individual galaxies have been plotted in this space as previous work has relied on ` schematic ' data .",
    "the ( black ) curves `` after ac '' also need to assume a ratio between the virial radius and the initial radius ( @xmath82 ) which is mapped into @xmath12 .",
    "we use again the sample to find @xmath104 ( see figure [ fig : rf ] ) .",
    "the figure shows consistency with our previous results .",
    "the curves tracing @xmath105 uses the dynamical timescale :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the total density of baryonic and dark matter and the cooling timescale is    @xmath108    where n is the number density of nuclei and @xmath109 is the net cooling rate for solar ( or zero ) metallicity from @xcite .",
    "as expected , the galaxies after contraction lie in the region of the plot where @xmath110 .",
    "although the approach is simplistic , assuming that galaxies are uniform spheres rather than using radial profiles , it is intriguing that 2-sigma fluctuations even for massive galaxies lie on the cooling curve for zero metallicity systems , and that adiabatic contraction promotes cooling of these systems .",
    "this result may be followed up with detailed simulations .",
    "the sample of early - type galaxies selected by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) from the sloan digitial sky survey has been used to investigate the properties of baryonic and dark matter within these systems . for the work presented in this paper , the sample",
    "was further restricted to be volume limited , containing only massive elliptical systems , leaving a total of more than 2000 systems .",
    "using photometry from sloan data release 4 and the synthetic stellar populations of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) we calculated the mass in stars of each system .",
    "we recover the well - known faber - jackson relation between luminosity and observed velocity dispersion and also find a tight correlation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion , which we have called the ` baryonic faber - jackson relation ' .",
    "we find a slope of @xmath111 ( in appropriate units ) , less steep than previous work @xcite based on a study of an order of magnitude fewer galaxies .",
    "in addition to determining the stellar mass , it is possible to determine a dynamical mass via the velocity dispersion and the radius of the system . comparing the two estimates of mass",
    "reveals that dark matter is underabundant in the centre of such galaxies when compared to the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "however , our results are in good agreement with observers who have claimed that the inner regions of massive elipticals are baryon dominated .    in order to examine whether this large data set is sufficient to discriminate between galaxy formation via monolithic collapse or the merging of small dark matter haloes ,",
    "the data were compared to a simple model of spherical collapse .",
    "it was necessary to assume that the total mass of the systems under study is proportional to the mass within the baryon - rich core ( within @xmath12 ) , but given such an assumption we find that for @xmath16 ( where @xmath112/@xmath113 ) , the data were found to be consistent with simple monolithic collapse of 3-sigma peturbations ( assuming @xmath0cdm cosmology ) .",
    "interestingly , this choice of @xmath55 also produces a value for the fraction of the mass which lies in the form of cooled baryons which is consistent with other work .",
    "a choice of 20 seems large , but corresponds to the stellar mass contributing half of the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "given the other reservoirs of baryons in these systems , this is a reasonable value .    having motivated our choice of @xmath55 , we used the adiabatic contraction method first due to @xcite to calculate the response of the dark matter to the presence of the observed baryons .",
    "we assume that the dark matter has an initial nfw profile , and produce the distribution of initial concentration shown in figure [ fig : c ] .",
    "the mean concentration is lower than that found in dissipation - less n - body simulations .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the b03 sample of early - type galaxies is a powerful resource for studying the distribution of matter within these objects . however , despite this excellent data set we can not rule out spherical collapse as a mode of formation for massive ellipticals .",
    "we find that the central regions of the galaxies , which are baryon dominated , must represent only a small fraction of the total mass of the system .",
    "in future work , we will extend our analysis to a new large sample of early - type systems , and undertake a detailed comparision of simulation results in order to understand the differences between observations and semi - analytic models .",
    "we would like to thank jacob bekenstein , sandra faber and rachel somerville for valuable discussions .",

    "<S> in the context of recent observational results that show massive ellipticals were in place at high redshifts , we reassess the status of monolithic collapse in a @xmath0cdm universe . using a sample of over 2000 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , by comparing the dynamical mass and stellar mass ( estimated from colours ) we find that ellipticals have ` cores ' which are baryon - dominated within their half - light radius . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies correspond to 3-sigma peaks in the spherical collapse model if the total mass in the halo is assumed to be 20 times the dynamical mass within the half - light radius </S>",
    "<S> . this value yields stellar mass to total mass ratios of 8% , compared to a cosmological baryon fraction of 18% derived from wmap3 alone . </S>",
    "<S> we further develop a method for reconstructing the concentration halo parameter @xmath1 of the progenitors of these galaxies by utilizing adiabatic contraction . </S>",
    "<S> although the analysis is done within the framework of monolithic collapse , the resulting distribution of @xmath1 is log - normal with a peak value of @xmath2 and a distribution width similar to the results of n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive scaling relations between stellar and dynamical mass and the velocity dispersion , and find that these are sufficient to recover the tilt of the fundamental plane . </S>"
