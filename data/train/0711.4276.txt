    "the problem of how many dimensional fundamental constants are in nature has been subject of debate for a long time ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in the beginning of the xx century , planck stated that four dimensional constants were necessary and sufficient to describe all physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "he named these constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 , which turned out to be related to the modern constants @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the symbol @xmath1 has been kept since then to represent the speed of light .",
    "planck showed , furthermore , that these constants could be combined in order to get a ",
    "natural \" system of three basic units : units of length @xmath10 , time @xmath11 , and mass @xmath12 .",
    "( incidentally , their numerical values were close to the set of units previously suggested by stoney in the context of electromagnetism  @xcite even before the introduction of the planck constant @xmath2 . )",
    "a closer analysis of the four planck s original dimensional constants has revealed that the combination @xmath13 , namely @xmath6 , turns out to be a conversion factor between temperature and energy units , leading to the well accepted conclusion that the boltzmann constant has its origin in the historical fact that temperature was not early recognized as a manifestation of kinetic energy .",
    "had temperature been defined , at early times , as twice the mean energy stored in each degree of freedom of a system in thermal equilibrium ( whenever the equipartition energy principle is valid ) and the boltzmann constant would have the dimensionless value 1 ( i.e. , it would not have been introduced at all ) , in which case entropy would be also dimensionless .",
    "the view that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 would be the three fundamental constants of nature is often expressed by means of the so called  cube of natural units \" or  cube of theories \" first introduced by gamov , ivanenko and landau in the late twenties ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , where the three dimensional constants involved in the construction of the planck basic units appear explicitly .",
    "the vertices of the cube would correspond to certain limiting regimes of the physical laws .",
    "for instance , the origin @xmath14 would correspond to non - relativistic mechanics , @xmath15 to special relativity , @xmath16 to non - relativistic quantum mechanics , @xmath17 to general relativity and so on  @xcite ( see left - hand side of fig .  [ squashing ] ) .    such a conception has been recently challenged .",
    "veneziano has concluded through string - theoretical arguments that the number of dimensional fundamental constants would be two , while duff has advocated for none at all  @xcite .",
    "this is quite unacceptable that this question is still controversial .",
    "the problem here does not concern the fact of not having an answer to some _ objective _ question but having different answers to the same question . here",
    "we make a clear statement of the problem and present what we believe to be a final solution : _ the number of fundamental dimensional constants is two_. we emphasize that our conclusion can be objectively refuted if it is shown that there exists some observable measured in laboratory that can not be expressed in a basis of _ two _ independent observables as shown in eq .",
    "( [ o1o2 ] ) .",
    "what we present here is , thus , an objective conclusion rather than a philosophical opinion .",
    "let us begin by clearly stating the points upon which our line of reasoning is based :    * without going into the subtleties of precisely defining what a physical theory _ is _ , we only assume that any `` good '' physical theory should fulfill the following minimum criteria : ( i ) list the observables it deals with , ( ii ) prescribe how to measure these observables , and ( iii ) provide self - consistent relations among them ( the `` physical laws '' ) ; * these relations are then tested against experimental data obtained through properly chosen processes , which we _ assume _ to take place in the spacetime ; _ eventually , all we can directly measure are space and time intervals_. in particular , this _ implies _ that one only needs two units to express all measurements .",
    "the _ basic units _ of space and time , say @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , can be chosen in a quite arbitrary way , and once this is done , any observable @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 being real ( dimensionless ) numbers , and @xmath25 belonging to some index set @xmath26 . for the sake of notation simplicity , the index @xmath25 gives information not only about the physical quantity being considered ( energy , spin ,  ) but also about the state of the system ( no matter how the theory chooses to describe it ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath22 , for given @xmath25 , is indeed a real number instead of a real - valued function .",
    "it is in order now to stress that one can select any pair @xmath27 and @xmath28 of _ independent _ observables to express all the other ones as follows .",
    "since @xmath29 , let us cast them as @xmath30 where by independent we mean that @xmath31 and @xmath32 form a basis of @xmath33 .",
    "then , we can solve eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) for @xmath19 and @xmath18 and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ obs1 ] ) associated with all other observables as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are clearly real numbers , namely , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that @xmath40 is guaranteed by our requirement that @xmath27 and @xmath28 be independent .",
    "although the choice @xmath41 is arbitrary , there may be more convenient ways ( possibly theory - dependent ) of selecting this basic set .",
    "indeed , the speed of light @xmath1 and the transition time @xmath42 between certain energy states of the cesium atom , which are presently adopted to define the standard units of space and time  @xcite , could be naturally chosen to constitute the basic set .    at this point ,",
    "let us clearly distinguish what we are saying from what we are _ not _ saying .",
    "our conclusion that all the observables @xmath20 can be expressed in terms of only two basic dimensional observables does _ not _ imply the existence of some `` final '' theory able to _ predict _ all dimensionless real numbers @xmath35 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ o1o2 ] ) ( no matter how desirable it may be ) .",
    "for instance , in the standard model the total number of dimensional and dimensionless parameters which should be provided as input in order to predict all the other observables is much larger than two .",
    "however , one can choose any pair of independent dimensional constants from this set and express all the other ones ( and , consequently , all observables ) in terms of this pair .",
    "a question which can be raised is how observables which are usually written not only in terms of space and time units , e.g.  mass , fit into this scheme .",
    "we exhibit next two protocols where the mass unit @xmath43 ( g , pounds ,  ) is solely expressed in terms of units of space and time . for the sake of simplicity , in both protocols we start assuming the cgs system , where all observable quantities @xmath44 are expressed in terms of units of space @xmath45  ( cm ) , time @xmath46  ( s ) , and mass @xmath43  ( g ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath49 are real numbers .    *",

    "for instance , by applying the @xmath0 protocol to the original newton s gravitational law @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 where the units of @xmath57 is @xmath58 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath0 plays the role of a conversion factor ( from @xmath54 to g ) as much as does the boltzmann constant @xmath6 ( from erg to kelvin ) .",

    "( [ fg ] ) that this procedure of eliminating the unit of mass @xmath43 leads @xmath59 to be directly interpreted as ( and not only related to ) _ active gravitational _ mass , and that it can be obtained simply through space and time measurements by determining the acceleration @xmath60 induced on test particles lying at a distance @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , we note for further purposes that the @xmath0 protocol applied to ( the observable ) planck s constant @xmath2 leads to @xmath62 whose dimension is @xmath63 . *",

    "we note that the @xmath2 protocol applied to newton s constant @xmath0 leads to @xmath76 note that @xmath77 .",
    "( a sort of implementation of the @xmath2 protocol can be found in refs .",

    "( [ o1o2 ] ) rather than eq .",
    "( [ cald ] ) does not change any of their predictions .",
    "nevertheless , it can shed new light on some conceptual issues .",
    "next , we discuss and resolve in this context the much - debated question about what is the number of dimensional fundamental constants in nature .",
    "in the previous section we presented two protocols in which mass can be determined through space and time measurements alone . in order to do so , each one of those protocols made use of a specific law relating mass with space and time intervals .",
    "however , since we claim that our main conclusion ( regarding the number of dimensional fundamental constants ) is general and theory - independent , one might wonder `` what if nature did not comply with any such a law ? '' for the sake of concreteness , let us imagine that newtonian mechanics in the _ absence _ of gravity were all that there was to the laws of nature .",
    "how would our arguments apply in this case ?",
    "firstly , it is important ( though obvious ) to point out that nature would look completely different . in that case ,",
    "( inertial ) mass would no longer be determined in terms of space and time measurements and a _ standard _ of mass , let us say the _ kilogram _ , might be introduced .",
    "any mass would then be determined as some multiple of this standard mass through , e.g. , colision experiments ( recall that gravity is not available ) .",
    "our point , however , is that in this case mass is no longer an _",
    "observable _ as defined in eq .",
    "( [ obs1 ] ) , and , therefore , the laws of nature can be rewritten in such a way to completely avoid the appearance of mass .",
    "this is certainly possible according to our definition of `` physical law '' given in point * 1 . * of sec .",
    "[ sec : st ] , although they may look more complicated and appear in a larger number in this rewritten form .",
    "once that is done , we are left again with only space and time units .",
    "for those ( like some of the authors ) who would rather take the philosophical stand that even in the context above ( newtonian mechanics with _ no _ gravity ) mass should be considered as `` observable '' ( in some extended sense ) due to the simplification it brings to the form of the physical laws , we point out that the need for an independent standard in this case reflects the fact that mass would be determined only up to a multiplicative constant : no mass scale would be privileged ( nature would be completely different indeed ) .",
    "therefore , this new standard ( introduced only to comply with someone s prejudice ) would not appear in any `` objective fundamental constant '' ( i.e. , those which determine `` fundamental scales '' , as most people seem to interpret what a fundamental constant is ) .",
    "interestingly enough , in this same context a similar argument can be applied to space and time units to show that newtonian mechanics in the absence of gravity has no `` objective fundamental constants '' at all ( no fundamental space or time scales ) .",
    "the fact that we experience space and time as distinct entities and that nature does not present itself invariant under rescale of these quantities seem to indicate that there should indeed exist fundamental scales of space and time .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that we have already reached an understanding of the physical laws from which these scales can be read out .    since nature",
    "does provide ways of measuring mass in terms of space and time intervals ( the @xmath0 and @xmath2  protocols ) , the main relevance of the discussion above lies in the fact that it can be applied to any `` observable '' ( in the extended sense ) which may appear in some ( still unknown ) physical law : the `` observable '' is either determined in terms of space and time measurements ( a true observable ) or it can not appear in determining fundamental constants which set scales in nature .    up to this point , our discussion was quite general and our conclusions followed directly from assumptions * 1.-2 .",
    "* of sec .",
    "[ sec : st ] . here , we raise accordingly some speculative physical considerations , which may be of some relevance . for this purpose",
    ", we choose the protocol @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , we note that the protocol @xmath0 frees classical mechanics from its only ( so called )  fundamental parameter \" , namely , newton s gravitational constant .",
    "this is very convenient since the value of @xmath0 ( like the value of @xmath6 ) does not determine any scale for new physics , in contrast to , e.g. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which fix a velocity and an angular momentum scale , respectively , where relativistic and quantum mechanical effects become important . in the @xmath0 protocol",
    "it becomes clear that classical mechanics does not have any prefered basis @xmath79 of independent observables ( see the origin of the plane of theories in fig .",
    "[ squashing ] ) .",
    "newton s gravitational and second laws are written in this context as @xmath80 respectively . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) with the coulomb law @xmath81 we see that ( gravitational ) mass and electric charge have the same status as coupling constants of the respective interactions , as they should .",
    "the fact that gravitational mass happens to give also a measure of _ inertia _ is a separate , more profound issue , only partially addressed by general relativity  .",
    "the actual bias driven by our present theories suggests that a natural basis of independent observables would be @xmath82 .",
    "the vertices @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the plane of theories ( see fig .  [ squashing ] ) represent non - relativistic and classical physics , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this scenario what we usually denominate ( a ) _ quantum gravity _",
    "( whatever it is ) and ( b ) _ quantum field theory _ would dwell at the same vertex @xmath85 of fig .  [ squashing ] .",
    "this would be reflecting the expected feature that a complete theory ( which we call here _ quantum relativity _ ) describing consistently all interactions ( including gravity ) should contain ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we note that quantum relativity effects can appear at quite low energies .",
    "the hawking temperature @xmath86 associated with the evaporation of ( static ) black holes with mass @xmath87 is a good example of it . if @xmath1 were substantially larger , @xmath88 would be able to be trivially tested in stellar - size black holes .",
    "a distinct point that becomes obvious in the context of the @xmath0 protocol is that an electron has much more electric than  gravitational \" charge : @xmath89 . on the other",
    "hand general relativity tells us that if a ( classical ) black hole is given more charge than mass it becomes a naked singularity .",
    "naked singularities are expected to be understood only in the context of quantum gravity . if quantum gravity and quantum field theory are both different aspects of a single quantum relativity theory , it is possible that naked singularities and elementary particles be understood by the same token .",
    "this is not odd if one notices that the planck scale for the angular momentum is precisely given by @xmath90 .",
    "as a result of our conclusion that all observables can be expressed as in eq .",
    "( [ o1o2 ] ) , _ any physical theory fulfilling conditions _ * 1.**2 .",
    "*  _ will not require more than a pair of independent dimensional constants to be expressed_. this pair of observables is what one usually denominates _ fundamental ( dimensional ) constants_. both protocols that we have presented favor @xmath1 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) to constitute this pair but other protocols could be easily devised ( e.g. , replacing @xmath2 by @xmath92 in the @xmath2 protocol ) . from a theory - independent perspective , no protocol can be privileged .",
    "however , some distinction can be made if we allow for biases coming from the present theories . in this sense , both the @xmath0  and @xmath2  protocols exhibit the nice feature of selecting as fundamental constants @xmath1 and @xmath90 , which define the regimes where relativistic and quantum effects become important , respectively .",
    "our conclusion that _ two _ ( @xmath1 , @xmath90 ) rather than _ three _",
    "( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) dimensional fundamental constants suffice can be nicely represented as in fig .  [ squashing ] by the squashing of the cube of theories .",
    "clearly , other choices of fundamental constants may become more convenient depending on future developments of our theories .",
    "eventually , for a full quantum gravity ( or `` quantum relativity '' ) theory , the following pair may be more convenient : @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "[ tplp ] ) .    in order to avoid any misunderstanding ,",
    "let us clarify one point which might cause some confusion .",
    "after adopting the @xmath0  ( or @xmath2 )  protocol to eliminate the mass unit @xmath43 from all quantities in eq .",
    "( [ cald ] ) , one could easily envisage an extra protocol to carry out the elimination of one of the remaining units @xmath46 _ or _",
    "@xmath45 , e.g. , a `` @xmath1  protocol '' , in which case all quantities would be expressed accordingly as multiples of some power of @xmath45 _ or _",
    "@xmath46 alone .",
    "in fact , one could proceed even further and use the other fundamental constant @xmath90 ( after properly redefined through the hypothetical @xmath1  protocol ) and vanish the sole unit left . in this case , all quantities would be dimensionless numbers . although this is true , it does _ not _ imply that the number of dimensional fundamental constants would be one or zero  @xcite .",
    "we must recall that our line of reasoning is based on points * 1.2 . *  of sec .",
    "[ sec : st ] , and _ not _ on the existence of some protocol to lower the number of units in physical equations .",
    "the latter only eliminates unnecessary structures once the number of dimensional fundamental constants is established .",
    "after all , our conclusion that the number of dimensional fundamental constants is two comes from the following facts : ( i )  space and time are distinct entities ( a fact which should be accounted for in any `` complete theory '' ) and ( ii )  combined measurements of space and time suffice to characterize any physical system . points ( i )  and ( ii )  above set the _ lower _ and _ upper _ bounds , respectively , for the number of dimensional fundamental constants to be _ two_. our conclusions are in agreement with veneziano ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but our arguments are model independent .",
    "we emphasize once again that our conclusion above can be objectively refuted if it is shown that there exists some observable measured in laboratory that can not be expressed in a basis of _ two _ independent observables as shown in eq .",
    "( [ o1o2 ] ) .",
    "this is , thus , an objective conclusion rather than a philosophical opinion .",
    "a number of valuable papers reformulating physical theories in a more transparent or elegant way can be found in the literature .",
