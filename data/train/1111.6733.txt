    "topological charge density is an important characteristic of the qcd vacuum , recently involved in phenomenological studies of many new hypothetical effects @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial structure of the topological density distribution seems to be not well defined since the relevant properties of the underlying vacuum structure depend on the measuring procedure @xcite .",
    "the classical instanton approach @xcite assumes that the nonperturbative physics is governed by the scale of @xmath1 , which means that the dimensionful quantities like volumes occupied by topological fermion modes should depend on @xmath1 but not on the lattice spacing . on the contrary ,",
    "the lattice measurements demonstrate that these volumes do depend on the spacing ( i.e. on the measurement resolution ) and shrink to zero in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the continuum definition of the topological charge density @xmath2 can not be directly applied to the lattice gauge theory , since the discretized version of ( [ topcharge ] ) is no longer a full derivative .",
    "there are two widely used methods to study the topology of gauge fields on the lattice .",
    "first , one can apply a smearing procedure , which makes the gauge fields smoother and thus closer to the classical fields .",
    "second , one can rely on the lattice version of the atyah - singer theorem and define the total topological charge of a gauge field configuration as the number of zero modes of the overlap dirac operator @xcite on this configuration .",
    "the corresponding local density of topological charge can be defined , for example , as follows @xcite : @xmath3\\ , , \\label{latttopcharge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the zero - mass neuberger operator and the trace is taken over spinor and color indices .",
    "another attractive property of this definition is that it allows us to measure a _ local _ imbalance in the number of left- and right - handed quarks ( chirality ) , which is important for lattice studies of the _ local _ cp - violation in strong interactions @xcite . a typical result of the lattice simulation for this quantity ( without cooling ) is shown in fig .  [ distribution ] .",
    "at the moment there are many investigations related to the spatial structure of the topological charge distribution @xcite , which use both of the alternative definitions .",
    "the measurements which rely on the cooling procedure mostly suggest an instanton - like picture of the qcd vacuum @xcite , while the definition ( [ latttopcharge ] ) typically shows that the topological charge is localized at low - dimensional objects ( defects ) @xcite and has a very - long - range structure of the distribution @xcite . at the qualitative level",
    "it is known that both definitions yield the topological charge densities which are strongly correlated @xcite . for an alternative filtering method based on adjoint fermions",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .     for a fixed time slice ,",
    "corresponding to the @xmath5 lattice in table  [ lattices ] .",
    "colors represent positive ( red ) and negative ( blue ) values , respectively . for the animation ,",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the literature and to demonstrate in what way the cooling procedure affects the dimensionality of regions where the topological charge density is localized .",
    "we use the definition ( [ latttopcharge ] ) based on zero modes of overlap dirac operator and show that as the gauge field configurations are cooled the dimension of these regions gradually tends to 4 , which is the total space dimension .",
    "the procedure makes the effective resolution of the measurement lower and thus provides a result close to the instanton picture .",
    "we verify our result using several measures of the localization @xcite .",
    ".lattice parameters used in the calculation : couplings @xmath6 , lattice spacings @xmath7 , lattice sizes @xmath8 , physical volume @xmath9 , and number of gauge field configurations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we modify the ipr to measure localization properties of the topological charge distribution .",
    "the average chirality @xmath10_\\lambda$ ] is zero , therefore we have to use either the absolute value @xmath11 or the square @xmath12 ^ 2 $ ] . here",
    "we stick to the definition from @xcite , which in our terms has the following form @xmath13_{\\lambda=0}\\,.\\label{def2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    results are presented in fig .",
    "[ gattringer_ipr1 ] . from the plots we conclude that the topological charge distribution behaves similar to the zero modes , tending to occupy a vanishing volume in the continuum limit .",
    "we can also compute the chiral ipr for small but nonzero eigenvalues ( in our case we pick first 7 eigenvalues , @xmath14 ) , @xmath15_{\\lambda \\neq 0}\\,.\\label{def3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] chiral ipr for these modes is small ( fig .",
    "[ gattringer_ipr2 ] ) and thus the topological charge distribution at this part of the spectrum is delocalized .",
    "finally we consider a second definition of the chiral ipr according to @xcite : @xmath16_{\\lambda=0}\\,,\\label{def4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as before , @xmath17 denotes the chirality on a zero mode ( [ latttopcharge ] ) .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ aubin_ipr ] .",
    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ gubarev_ipr ] , [ gattringer_ipr1 ] , and [ aubin_ipr ] the ipr for the zero modes and for the topological charge density on these modes are the same up to negligible deviations",
    ". results of the fitting procedure coincide for these three cases and are shown in table  [ ipr_table ] .",
    "the coincidence is not accidental , because for the zero modes @xmath18 = 0 $ ] and @xmath19 .",
    "this means that on a given mode @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equal to each other up to a sign .      to conclude",
    ", we demonstrate that the topological charge is localized on low - dimensional fractal structures , whose fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension depends on the number of cooling steps .",
    "the obtained dimension is about @xmath22 for a few ( @xmath23 ) steps of the cooling , while it grows to @xmath24 with further iterations ( see fig .",
    "[ dimensions_plot ] ) . for a long cooling ( @xmath25 )",
    "the result becomes insignificant , because the procedure leads to a delocalization of the distributions as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ gubarev_ipr][aubin_ipr ] ( otherwise ipr remains consistent with a constant within error bars ) .",
    "we suppose that it can be caused by the annihilation of the instanton / anti - instanton pairs . indeed , comparing the mean action evolution ( fig .",
    "[ action ] ) with the one from e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite we see that the annihilation phase in our case could start already from @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same cooling algorithm is used , the annihilation takes place even at a smaller number of steps .",
    "the main conclusions of our paper are the following :    * fermionic zero modes and chirality are localized on structures with fractal dimension @xmath22 , which is an argument in favor of the vortex / domain - wall nature of the localization @xcite . *",
    "a long sequence of iterations of the cooling procedure provides a result close to the instanton picture , i.e. destroys the low - dimensional structure of the qcd vacuum .    finally , let us briefly mention a possible phenomenological consequence of our study .",
    "one of the most promising effects appearing due to the nontrivial topology of the qcd vacuum is the so - called `` chiral magnetic effect '' ( cme ) @xcite , which states the generation of an electric current in parallel to an external magnetic field .",
    "topological charge density in this case can be understood as an imbalance in the number of left- and right - handed light quarks induced by a nontrivial gluonic background .",
    "this effect is expected to explain charge asymmetries observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "some evidences of the cme on the lattice as well as numerical estimates for the values of the local topological charge were also obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . at the current level of analytic studies cme is considered as an effect on the background of spatially homogeneous axial fields @xcite , while the lattice simulations predict an irregular structure of the would - be axial field ( see fig .",
    "[ distribution ] ) .",
    "this spatial inhomogeneity can be treated within a chiral superfluid model @xcite , where the chirality is carried by an effective axion - like field .",
    "knowledge of the nature of the topological charge localization can help us to translate lattice euclidean properties of the chirality to the language of an effective minkowski field theory @xcite .",
