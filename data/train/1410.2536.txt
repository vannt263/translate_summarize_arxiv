    "the _ kissing number _ @xmath6 is the highest number of equal non - overlapping spheres in @xmath7 that touch another sphere of the same size . in three dimensions the kissing number problem asks how many white billiard balls can _ kiss _",
    "( i.e. touch ) a black ball .",
    "the most symmetrical configuration , 12 balls around another , is achieved if the 12 balls are placed at positions corresponding to the vertices of a regular icosahedron concentric with the central ball . however , these 12 outer balls do not kiss one another and each may be moved freely . this space between the balls",
    "prompts the question : _ if you moved all of them to one side , would a 13th ball fit ? _    this problem was the subject of the famous discussion between isaac newton and david gregory in 1694 .",
    "most reports say that newton believed the answer was 12 balls , while gregory thought that 13 might be possible .",
    "this problem is often called the _ thirteen spheres problem_. the problem was finally solved by schtte and van der waerden in 1953 @xcite . a subsequent two - page sketch of an elegant proof",
    "was given by leech @xcite in 1956 .",
    "leech s proof was presented in the first edition of the well - known book by aigner and ziegler @xcite ; the authors removed this chapter from the second edition because a complete proof would have to include too much spherical trigonometry .",
    "the thirteen spheres problem continues to be of interest , and new proofs have been published in the last several years by hsiang @xcite , maehara @xcite ( this proof is based on leech s proof ) , brczky @xcite , anstreicher @xcite , and musin @xcite .    note that for @xmath8 , the kissing number problem is currently solved only for @xmath9 @xcite , and for @xmath10 @xcite ( see @xcite for a beautiful exposition of this problem ) .      if @xmath0 unit spheres kiss the unit sphere in @xmath7 , then the set of kissing points is an arrangement on the central sphere such that the ( euclidean ) distance between any two points is at least 1 .",
    "this observation allows us to state the kissing number problem in another way : _ how many points can be placed on the surface of @xmath11 so that the angular separation between any two points be at least @xmath12 ? _",
    "it leads to an important generalization .",
    "a finite subset @xmath13 of @xmath11 is called a _",

    "this question is also known as the problem of the `` inimical dictators '' , namely _ where should @xmath0 dictators build their palaces on a planet so as to be as far away from each other as possible ? _",

    "the tammes problem for @xmath5 is of particular interest due to its relation to both the kissing problem and the kepler conjecture @xcite . actually , this problem is equivalent to _ the strong thirteen spheres problem _ , which asks to find the maximum radius of and an arrangement for 13 equal size non - overlapping spheres in @xmath25 touching the unit sphere .",
