    "ae  aqr is an unusual cataclysmic variable star exhibiting bizarre phenomena that can now be interpreted in the context of a magnetic propeller that throws gas out of the binary system @xcite .",
    "the magnetic propeller efficiently extracts energy and angular momentum from the white dwarf and transports it via magnetic fields to gas stream material which it ejects from the binary system .",
    "detailed understanding of the magnetic propeller effects may therefore help us to unlock some of the secrets of magnetic viscosity in accretion flows .    in the ae  aqr binary system , a slightly evolved k star @xcite that overflows its roche lobe",
    "is locked in a 9.88 hour orbit with a rapidly spinning magnetized white dwarf .",
    "coherent oscillations in optical @xcite , ultraviolet @xcite , and x - ray @xcite lightcurves reveal the white dwarf s 33s spin period .",
    "the oscillation has two unequal peaks per spin cycle , consistent with broad hotspots on opposite sides of the white dwarf @xmath0 above and below the equator @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are strongest in the ultraviolet , where their spectra show a blue continuum with broad ly  @xmath1 absorption consistent with a white dwarf ( @xmath2 ) atmosphere with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation is accretion heating near the poles of a magnetic dipole field tipped almost perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "an 11-year study of the optical oscillation period @xcite shows that the white dwarf is spinning down at an alarming rate .",
    "something extracts rotational energy from the white dwarf at a rate @xmath4 ie .",
    "some 60 times the luminosity of the system .",
    "we now believe that to be a magnetic propeller .",
    "this model was first proposed by and and expanded upon in with comparison of observed and modelled tomograms .",
    "further work on the flaring region was reported in and .    the gas stream emerging from the companion star through the l1 nozzle encounters a rapidly spinning magnetosphere .",
    "the rapid spin makes the effective ram pressure so high that only a low - density fringe of material becomes threaded onto field lines .",
    "most of the stream material remains diamagnetic , and is dragged toward co - rotation with the magnetosphere . as this occurs outside the co - rotation radius , this magnetic drag propels material forward , boosting its velocity up to and beyond escape velocity .",
    "the material emerges from the magnetosphere and sails out of the binary system .",
    "this process efficiently extracts energy and angular momentum from the white dwarf , transferring it via the long - range magnetic field to the stream material , which is expelled from the system . the ejected outflow consists of a broad equatorial fan of material launched over a range of azimuths on the side away from the k star .",
    "the material stripped from the gas stream and threaded by the field lines has a different fate , one which we believe gives rise to the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "this material co - rotates with the magnetosphere while accelerating along field lines either toward or away from the white dwarf under the influences of gravity and centrifugal forces .",
    "the small fraction of the total mass transfer that leaks below the co - rotation radius at @xmath5 accretes down field lines producing the surface hotspots responsible for the 33s oscillations .",
    "particles outside co - rotation remain trapped long enough to accelerate up to relativistic energies through magnetic pumping , eventually reaching a sufficient energy density to break away from the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the resulting ejection of balls of relativistic magnetized plasma is thought to give rise to the flaring radio emission @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses the optical and ultraviolet variability seen in ae  aqr . in many studies the lightcurves exhibit dramatic flares , with 1 - 10 minute rise and fall times @xcite .",
    "the flares seem to come in clusters or avalanches of many super - imposed individual flares separated by quiet intervals of gradually declining line and continuum emission @xcite .",
    "these quiet and flaring states typically last a few hours .",
    "power spectra computed from the lightcurves have a power - law form , with larger amplitudes on longer timescales . found that the index in @xmath6 was -1 .",
    "that is , that the amplitude of the flare or flicker varies inversely as the frequency of its occurence .",
    "examined several datasets and found values for @xmath1 in the range @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "such power - law spectra are often associated with physical processes involving self - organized criticality , for example earthquakes , snow or sandpile avalanches @xcite .",
    "similar red noise power spectra are seen in active galaxies , x - ray binaries , and other cataclysmic variables , and is therefore regarded as characteristic of accreting sources in general . however , flickering in other cataclysmic variables typically has an amplitude of 5 - 20% @xcite , contrasting with factors of several in ae  aqr . if the mechanism is the same , then it must be weaker or dramatically diluted in other systems .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet spectra of the ae  aqr flares are not understood at present except in the most general terms . the lines and continua rise and fall together , with little change in the equivalent widths or ratios of the emission lines @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the flares represent changes in the amount of material involved more than changes in physical conditions .",
    "the balmer emission lines decay somewhat more slowly than the optical continuum  perhaps revealing a recombination time delay @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet spectra from hst reveal a wide range of lines representing a diverse mix of ionization states and densities .",

    "the civ emission is unusually weak , suggesting non - solar abundances .",
    "for example , carbon depletion may occur if cno - processed material is being transferred from the secondary star , which is an evolved star being whittled down by roche lobe overflow .",

    "what mechanism triggers these dramatic optical and ultraviolet flares ?",
    "clues come from multi - wavelength co - variability and orbital kinematics .",
    "simultaneous vla and optical observations show that the radio flux variations occur on similar timescales but are not correlated with the optical and ultraviolet flares , which therefore require a different mechanism @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the flares represent modulations of the accretion rate onto the white dwarf , so that they should be correlated with x - ray variability .",
    "some correlation was found , but the correlation is not high .",
    "however , hst observations discard this model , because the ultraviolet oscillation amplitude is unmoved by transitions between the quiet and flaring states @xcite .",
    "this disconnects the origins of the oscillations and flares , and the oscillations arise from accretion onto the white dwarf , so the flares must arise elsewhere .",
    "further clues come from emission line kinematics .",
    "the emission line profiles may be roughly described as broad gaussians with widths @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 , though they often exhibit kinks and sometimes multiple peaks .",
    "detailed study of the balmer lines @xcite indicates that the new light appearing during a flare can have emission lines shifted from the line centroid and somewhat narrower , @xmath18  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "individual flares therefore occupy only a subset of the entire emission - line region .",
    "the emission line centroid velocities vary sinusoidally with orbital phase , with semi - amplitudes @xmath19  km  s@xmath17 and maximum redshift near phase @xmath200.8 @xcite .",
    "these unusual orbital kinematics are shared by both ultraviolet and optical emission lines .",
    "the implication is that the flares arise from gas moving with a @xmath19  km  s@xmath17 velocity vector that rotates with the binary and points away the observer at phase 0.8 .",
    "this is hard to understand in the standard model of a cataclysmic variable star , though many cataclysmic variables show similar anomalous emission - line kinematics @xcite .",
    "kepler velocities in an ae  aqr accretion disc would be @xmath21  km  s@xmath17 ( though we believe no disc to be present . )",
    "the gas stream has a similar direction but its velocity is @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "a success of the magnetic propeller models is its ability to account for the anomalous emission - line kinematics .",
    "the correct velocity amplitude and direction occurs in the exit fan just outside the roche lobe of the white dwarf .",
    "but the question remains of why the flares are ignited here , several hours after the gas slips silently through the magnetosphere .",
    "the key insight which solved this puzzle was the realization that the magnetic propeller acts as a blob sorter .",
    "more compact , denser , diamagnetic blobs are less affected by magnetic drag .",
    "they punch deeper into the magnetosphere and emerge at a larger azimuth with a smaller terminal velocity .",
    "these compact blobs can therefore be overtaken by ` fluffier ' blobs ejected with a larger terminal velocity in the same direction , having left the companion star somewhat later but spent less time in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the result is a collision between two gas blobs , which can give rise to shocks and flares .",
    "calculations of the trajectories of magnetically propelled diamagnetic blobs with different drag coefficients indicate that they cross in an arc - shaped region of the exit stream , in just the right place to account for the orbital kinematics of the emission lines @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : trajdop ] shows how these trajectories map to a locus of points in the lower left quadrant of the doppler map that is otherwise difficult to populate .",
    "there remains the problem of developing a quantitative understanding of the unusual emission - line spectra of the blobs .",
    "we have two aims for this paper : the principle aim is to see if the observed peak optical flare spectrum can be reproduced by conditions appropriate to the aftermath of a collision between blobs .",
    "the secondary objective is to develop as far as possible an understanding of the mechanisms by which the observed spectra are formed and evolve .",
    "we have approached both goals in the spirit of attempting to find the simplest models that explain the observations .    in section  [ sec : models ]",
    "we outline the basic assumptions used in our models .",
    "we go on in section  [ sec : radtrans ] to consider the radiative transfer problem and calculate analytic expressions for the behaviour of the optical flare spectra and lightcurves and outline some numerical considerations . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of numerical simulations of the flare behaviour , both lightcurves and spectra , and consider further the limits of applicability of our method .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] in terms of the fireball model .",
    "finally we summarise our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we derive rough estimates for the physical parameters associated with the colliding blobs by using the typical rise time @xmath22 and an observed optical flux @xmath23  mjy with a closing velocity @xmath24 for the blobs .",
    "we estimate a mass transfer rate @xmath25 using a distance of 100pc .",
    "this compares to a value from the standard evolutionary equation @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the mean density of the overflowing gas stream in a cv can be calculated from @xmath27 where the stream cross - section @xmath28 has been derived by several authors @xcite . with a secondary temperature @xmath29 @xcite , we have a mean density , @xmath30 ie .",

    "[ fig : fullres ] shows the area around the h@xmath42 line produced with the population  i best fit parameters and with zero and modest expansion velocities , showing the intrinsic thermal resolution of the lines and the doppler blurring due to the expansion before instrumental effects are added .",
    "even with a relatively modest fiducial expansion velocity of @xmath43 we can see that many of the weaker lines are blurred into obscurity simply by the doppler effect . the h@xmath42 line at @xmath44    appears to be optically thick since its peak flux decreases only slightly as the line width increases .",
    "in contrast , the arii line at @xmath45    decreases greatly with doppler broadening and forms a blend with the weaker blueward nii line indicating that it is optically thin .    in fig .",

    "considering this and the possibility of additional , unidentified blurring suggests that a more reliable estimate might be the integrated line flux . in this case",
    ", the h@xmath46 and hei line suggest expansion velocities of @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively at @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , we adopt an expansion velocity at @xmath50 of @xmath55 for the simulations .    the optical spectra produced with both compositions are compared to the observed mean spectrum at the flare peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : popcomp ] .",
    "we see that the parameters , derived from the peak continuum fluxes alone , allow us to derive optical spectra with integrated line fluxes and ratios comparable to the observations .",
    "both models have line widths narrower than the observations , and hence peak line fluxes greater than those observed , which may result from additional unidentified instrumental blurring .",
    "the population i models show the flat balmer decrement of saturated balmer lines apparent in the data . comparing the lines that are present , however , particularly in the @xmath56    range",
    ", the population ii model appears to produce a much better fit : suppressing the metal lines which do not appear in the observed spectra .",
    "specifically , we note that siiii@xmath57 , cii@xmath58 , the siiii@xmath59 blend , oii@xmath60 , the sii@xmath61 , siiii@xmath62 and arii@xmath63 blend and cii@xmath64 are present in the population i models but are not present or are far weaker in the data .",
    "only the weak cii@xmath65 , cii@xmath66 , the siii@xmath67 blend and the oi@xmath68 blend are not reproduced by the population ii results .",
    "the timescale for the evolution of the fireball implied by the observed lightcurve can be reproduced by the parameters derived solely from fitting to the peak spectrum .",
    "the evolutionary timescale @xmath69 is approximately @xmath70  s and @xmath71  s for population i and ii parameters respectively .",
    "the encouraging result that these values are similar to the observed timescale suggests that our fireball models are on the right track .",
    "we thus consider the time evolution of the fireball models in more detail .",
    "[ fig : popimods ] and [ fig : popiimods ] , for population i and population ii abundances respectively , present the lightcurves and spectral evolution derived under the three assumptions we consider for the thermal history of the fireball : adiabatic , isothermal , and radiative . in each case , the model fireball is constrained to evolve through the state we found from the fit to the observations at the peak of the flare .",
    "this moment is assigned to @xmath72 and hence our assignment of @xmath73 subscripts for the fitted parameters above .",
    "the isothermal models produces a lightcurve that rises and falls , as observed .",
    "moreover , the peak in this lightcurve is in fact reasonably close to the time when the spectrum matches the spectrum observed at the peak of the flare .",
    "the isothermal fireball spectra , both on the rise and on the fall of the flare , exhibit strong balmer emission lines and a balmer jump in emission .",
    "thus the isothermal fireball model provides a good fit not only to the peak spectrum but also to the time evolution of the ae aqr flare .",
    "the adiabatic and radiative models both fail to reproduce the observed lightcurve or spectra .",
    "the adiabatic model matches the observed spectrum at one time , but is too hot at early times and too cool at late times . as a result",
    "the lightcurve declines monotonically from early times rather than rising to a peak and then falling , and the spectra have lines that do not match the observed spectra .",
    "this disappointing performance is perhaps not too surprising , since the temperature in this model falls through a wide range while the observations suggest that the temperature is always around @xmath74  k.    for the adiabatic fireball , equation  ( [ initt ] ) implies that the expansion rate is a measure of the initial temperature .",
    "hence , for an adiabatic fireball we can derive its age from the time taken to cool to the fitted temperature . for the population i parameters , @xmath55 gives an initial temperature of @xmath75 , an age of @xmath76 and hence from ( [ expfac ] ) an initial lengthscale of @xmath77 .",
    "the population ii parameters give an age of @xmath78 and initial lengthscale of @xmath79 .",
    "we note , however , that the lightcurve for the adiabatic fireballs do not show the rise to a peak for the same reason as the theoretical curves in section  [ sec : thlght ] . to explain the rise phase of the observed lightcurve we must interpret it as resulting from the collision of the initial gas blobs . under this assumption , we can estimate the age and initial size _ independently _ , for the adiabitic evolution , directly from the data ; knowing the rise time of the flare and the typical closing velocities : @xmath80    the radiative model looks roughly the same as the adiabatic model .",
    "this occurs because the cooling front ( as shown in fig .  [ fig : tprof ] ) occurs well outside the photosphere .",
    "we therefore `` see '' into the adiabatically - cooling core .",
    "this is not consistent with our assumption that the rapid cooling occurs near the photosphere as a result of the opacity drop there and suggests that a more sophisticated approach involving heating of the gas by emergent photons may be required for an accurate treatment of such a model .",
    "the spectra produced with population ii composition reproduce the optical observations well .",
    "the fitted parameters are consistent with both the expected conditions in the mass transfer stream and with the lower limits on the density implied by the uv observations .",
    "the presence of high ionization and semi - forbidden lines in the uv data can be understood qualitatively in terms of their formation in the low density outer fringes of the fireball and the wide variety of ionization states by the wide range of densities in the expanding fireball structure . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and population ii parameters ,",
    "the density of @xmath83 , important for the uv semi - forbidden lines , occurs at @xmath84 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ltelimtheory ] we see that this lies outside the limit for lte behaviour .",
    "quantitative fits for the fringe and uv behaviour , therefore , remain to be addressed in the non - lte regime extension to this work .",
    "parameters implying a lower overall density would result in an optically thinner fireball and spectrum .",
    "the balmer decrement would increase as would the equivalent widths of the optically thick balmer lines as the continuum dropped away from the blackbody envelope .",
    "continued decrease would result in the lines eventually becoming optically thin and losing the characteristically consistent strengths present when they are all saturated .",
    "the behaviour of the lightcurve for an isothermal model , like its theoretical counterpart is much more similar to the observed lightcurve than the other models giving a peak close to the observed time without the need to invoke the collision process .",
    "clearly though , an expanding gas ball would be expected to cool both from radiative and adiabatic expansion effects .",
    "the radiative model shows very similar behaviour to the adiabatic models .",
    "the thin shell of cooling material at around @xmath85 does not provide sufficient opacity to mimic the isothermal behaviour and the adiabatic core is still visible to the outside observer .",
    "this effect appears to be insensitive to the exact choice of temperature we assign to material emerging from the central region .",
    "we noted in section  [ sec : ionfreeze ] that an accurate picture of the ionization would need to follow the lte to non - lte ionization transition .",
    "however , even considering only the early evolution of the fireballs , the isothermal lightcurve and spectral behaviour is stiller closer to the observations than the adiabatic .    in short , we find that isothermal fireballs reproduce the observations rather well , whereas adiabatically cooling fireballs fail miserably",
    "! how can the expanding gas ball present a nearly constant temperature at its surface ?",
    "we offer two possible mechanisms which may operate to maintain the apparent fireball temperature in the @xmath86@xmath87 region .",
    "the first relies on the fact that both free - free and bound - free opacity decrease with temperature and thus opacity peaks just above the temperature at which hydrogen begins to recombine . in the model where a core region is cooling through radiation from its surface , we can envision a situation where the material just outside the core has reached this high opacity regime and is absorbing significant amounts of energy from the core s radiation field .",
    "this would help to counteract the effect of adiabatic cooling and may maintain an effectively isothermal blanket around the core . if the temperature in the blanket were to rise , the opacity would decrease , more energy would escape and the blanket would cool again . similarly , until recombination , cooling would result in higher opacity and therefore greater heating of the blanket region .",
    "for such a thermostatic mechanism to work , the optical depth through the blanket region would need to be high which would be consistent with it being the photosphere as seen by an outside observer .",
    "realistic simulations of such a model would require a detailed treatment of the radiation field and its heating effect using a more sophisticated method than the one we have employed here .",
    "alternatively the ionization of the fireball might be held at a temperature typical of the @xmath86@xmath87 range through photoionization by the white dwarf . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionrate ] we plot the hydrogen ionization and recombination rates as a function of temperature for a typical electron number density @xmath88 using additional routines for photoionization from verner et al . ( 1996 ) and collisional ionization by verner using the results of voronov ( 1997 ) .",
    "we calculate a conservative overestimate for the self - photoionization of the fireball assuming the sky is half filled by blackbody radiation at the given fireball temperature .",
    "also shown is the photoionization due to a blackbody with the same radius and distance as the white dwarf .",
    "the general white dwarf temperature is uncertain but , as mentioned earlier , there is evidence to suggest that the hot spots have a temperature of around @xmath89 .",
    "we can see that the flux from the white dwarf overtakes that from the fireball itself as the dominant ionization mechanism at @xmath90 . we have assumed a typical distance from the white dwarf for the fireball equal to that of the l1 point from the white dwarf ( although in a different direction ) .",
    "the recombination rates for this plot have been calculated assuming @xmath91 is a constant and so for temperatures below about @xmath85 are conservative overestimates of the lte recombination rate that will occur in our fireball . in spite of this",
    ", the white dwarf photoionization at @xmath89 comfortably exceeds the recombination rates down to at least @xmath92 and , hence , we would expect the fireball to remain almost completely ionized in this case .",
    "this suggests that the white dwarf radiation field may be the cause of the fireball appearing isothermal when we consider the lightcurve behaviour and consistent line strengths and ratios .",
    "ionization by an external black body at a different temperature will clearly cause our fireball to no longer be in lte and require a non - lte model to follow the fireball behaviour .",
    "however , we can anticipate the results of a full non - lte treatment as follows . writing the _ total _ ionization rate per atom per second from all processes as @xmath93 and similarly the _ total _ recombination rate as @xmath94",

    "we plot the evolutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : bndcmp ] for no white dwarf photoionization and with rates appropriate to photoionization from a white dwarf at @xmath101 and @xmath89 .",
    "we see that the white dwarf can have a significant effect on the ionization structure of the fireball and keep large parts of it in an ionized state .",
    "we have shown for ae  aqr how the observed flare spectrum and evolution is reproducible with an isothermal fireball at @xmath102  k with population ii abundances but not when adiabatic cooling is incorporated .",
    "we suspect that the cause of the apparently isothermal nature is a combination of two mechanisms .",
    "first , a nearly isothermal photosphere which is self - regulated by the temperature dependance of the continuum opacity and the hydrogen recombination front and second , particularly at late times , by the ionizing effect of the white dwarf radiation field .",
    "the observed photosphere in the isothermal models is initially advected outward with the flow before the decreasing density causes the opacity to drop and the photosphere to shrink to zero size .",
    "this gives rise to a lightcurve that rises and then falls .",
    "emission lines and edges arise because the photospheric radius is larger at wavelengths with higher opacity .",
    "surfaces of constant doppler shift are perpendicular to the line of sight and thus gaussian density profiles give rise to gaussian velocity profiles .",
    "direct application of our lte fitting method to the uv region would not reproduce the observed spectra with their variety of ionization states and semi - forbidden and permitted lines .",
    "we have outlined techniques and possible improvements to the model that will increase our understanding further and enable us to take the work into the uv .",
    "more detailed modelling of the ionization and recombination processes is suggested that also incorporates the heating effects of both the white dwarf s and the fireballs own photon fields .",
    "the self - consistent solution to these rate equations will extend the treatment to the non - lte regimes discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] and appendix  [ sec : ltevalidity ] .",
    "these modifications may in turn have consequences for the predicted optical spectra .    improved modelling of these fireballs offers us the chance to probe the chemical composition of the secondary star in ae aqr .",
    "normally this is difficult because the spectrum of the relatively dim secondary star is contaminated by light from other components in the system .",
    "we expect that the fireball models will be applicable more generally to the flickering observed in most cv systems .",

    "lte requires that the electron , ions and photons are all in thermal equilibrium .",
    "lte also requires that detailed balance is able to be maintained .",
    "rapid expansion can interfere with this .",
    "since recombination rates decrease with density , ionization equilibrium should break down in the low density outskirts of the fireball .",
    "we derive a limiting radius inside which statistical equilibrium for ionization holds from the condition that the expansion timescale ( @xmath103 ) be longer than the recombination timescale ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "now , @xmath105 and @xmath106\\right\\rbrace^{-1 } , \\label{trecomb}\\ ] ] where we have taken the effective recombination timescale for the @xmath107th state of a given element from bottorff et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath108 is the recombination coefficient to the @xmath107th ionization state and the term in square brackets contains a correction factor to the commonly used expression . here , we assume that this term is unity but for detailed checks in section  [ detcheck ] we evaluate using the calculated densities .    for an initial estimate , we consider a fireball which is composed purely of hydrogen . equating ( [ eqn : exptscale ] ) and ( [ trecomb ] ) , we plot an estimate of the limiting ionization equilibrium radius for hydrogen in fig .  [",
    "fig : ltelimtheory ] , using parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath99 and a velocity at @xmath50 of @xmath111 giving @xmath112 .",
    "we use a radiative recombination rate given by @xmath113^{-1 } \\label{eqn : radrecrate}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the range of times for which the fireball is optically thick using a general opacity @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the stimulated emission correction and @xmath120 is a constant dependant upon the composition and whether bound - free or free - free opacity is being considered .",
    "for free - free opacity and pure hydrogen composition @xmath121 .",
    "we parameterize the temperature evolution in the form @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 for an isothermal model and @xmath124 for adiabatic cooling . integrating ( [ eqn : genopac ] ) over a line of sight through the centre of the gaussian density profile we can derive an optical depth through the fireball @xmath125 hence the condition for @xmath126 becomes @xmath127 using the parameters considered above and evaluating at @xmath128   .",
    "we can see that the expanding gas is optically thick at early times and that the limiting @xmath46 is relatively insensitive to the exact parameters given the strong power of @xmath46 in ( [ eqn : genopdpth ] ) .",
    "however , it is most strongly dependant on ( at least inversely proportional to ) the fiducial lengthscale @xmath129 .    we can estimate the time for temperature equilibrium to be established from the collision frequency between electrons and ions using the method of @xmath130 where we have evaluated the expression for the case of hydrogen using @xmath131 and the same fiducial parameters as above . by considering the energy exchanged in a collision and integrating over a maxwellian distribution of electron velocities we arrive at a timescale for ions and electrons to come into equilibrium @xmath132 electrons collide on a similar frequency but share out there energy on a timescale roughly @xmath133 quicker .    we can estimate the timescale for photons and electrons to reach equilibrium in an analogous way using the free - free cross - section @xmath134 and the opacity outlined above @xmath135 where we have evaluated the expression in the uv at @xmath136   .",
    "this estimate becomes less accurate at low optical depths since photons will be able to travel through significant changes in density before absorption .",
    "this would necessitate an integral over the probability of absorption per unit distance for an exact treatment .",
    "however , since inward photons will approach regions of higher density and outward lower density the mean density represented by this method is sufficiently precise for the use here .",
    "once the expansion becomes optically thin , then the assumption of a planck distribution in the derivation of ( [ eqn : nueg ] ) breaks down and the definition of the limiting radius itself becomes more fuzzy as photons will interact with electrons throughout the volume .",
    "when a photon is absorbed it gives up all its energy so that we can calculate the timescale to approach equilibrium by a similar method to that above .",
    "integrating over frequency we arrive at a timescale @xmath137    the limiting radii , where these timescales equal the expansion timescale are plotted as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltelimtheory ] alongside the ionization equilibrium limiting radius .",
    "the lowest of these three boundaries marks the limit for lte to hold .",
    "even for the late time behaviour , the minimum photon - electron equilibrium radius occurs at @xmath138 ie .",
    "@xmath139 which contains @xmath140% of the mass .",
    "the ionization - equilibrium timescale is the most volatile of the plotted timescales , since the limiting radius depends on the ionization structure for each element . as such",
    ", it should be calculated after each simulation using the stored ionization history to double check the validity .",
    "this radius will also evolve differently for each element .      examining the conditions for equality of equations ( [ eqn : exptscale ] ) and ( [ trecomb ] )",
    ", we can check the limiting radius for ionization equilibrium to hold for each ion included in each of the simulations .",
    "we plot results , for all the included ions , for the population ii adiabatic and isothermal models in figs .  [",
    "fig : adiltelim ] and [ fig : isoltelim ] .",
    "we use routines to calculate the recombination coefficient for all the appropriate processes using codes for radiative events by verner @xcite , dielectronic @xcite , three - body by cota ( 1987 ) as used in cloudy and charge transfer recombination events by kingdon & ferland ( 1996 ) .",
    "we can see that , in general , there is a slow evolution of the limiting radius with time .",
    "the quantised nature of the grid on which the ionization states , and thus recombination timescales , were calculated is apparent ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the dramatic switching that sometimes occurs results from changes in the ionization structure between one spectrum and the next .",
    "however , since we only require enough spectra to generate a clear lightcurve , the lack of temporal resolution for these changes is not of significant concern .    except for late times ,",
    "both of these evolutions give an ionization equilibrium limit @xmath142 ie .",
    "@xmath143 of the density distribution . as a result",
    "we can be assured that , under our assumptions , only a small fraction of the mass of the fireball has non - lte composition and our lte treatment is reasonable ."
