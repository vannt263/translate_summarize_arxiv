    "most first - principles calculations on condensed matter are nowadays based on density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "this theory is formally exact , but in practice an approximation has to be made to the exchange - correlation energy , and the vast majority of calculations employ the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the exchange - correlation energy per electron at any point in the system is related to the electron density at that point in the same way as in a uniform electron gas , and density gradients are ignored .",
    "some theoretical justification can be given for this  @xcite , and in practice the lda works well in a wide range of situations .",
    "however , its accuracy is not always satisfactory , particularly when energy differences associated with changes of bonding are needed , as in e.g. molecular dissociation or the adsorption of molecules at surfaces .",
    "attempts to improve the situation by adding lowest - order corrections in powers of the density gradient are not successful , but important progress has been made recently by requiring that the dependence of the energy on the gradients satisfies certain physical requirements .",
    "this has led to various forms of generalized gradient corrections ( ggc )  @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", there has been a large amount of work on the influence of different ggc schemes on the total energies of atoms and molecules  @xcite , the equilibrium structure and cohesive energies of covalent crystals  @xcite , the ground state of iron  @xcite , and the energetics of molecular adsorption on metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "however , so far as we are aware , there has been little work on the effect of ggc on the properties of partially ionic materials such as the oxides tio@xmath0 and sno@xmath0 treated here .",
    "the surface properties of materials like these are extremely important , because of their application as gas sensors and catalysts .",
    "we have recently reported a detailed study of the bulk and surface properties of sno@xmath0  @xcite , and we have initiated work on the interaction of molecules with the surfaces of both tio@xmath0 and sno@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of ggc is of considerable importance in this general area .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study the effect on the bulk and surface properties of tio@xmath0 and sno@xmath0 of the two widely used ggc schemes due to perdew and wang  @xcite and becke and perdew  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed using the pseudopotential method  @xcite , so that only the valence electrons are represented explicitly , the valence - core interaction being represented by non - local norm - conserving pseudopotentials , which are generated by first - principles calculations on isolated atoms .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used , with the occupied electronic orbitals expanded in a plane - wave basis .",
    "the expansion includes all plane waves whose kinetic energy @xmath1 ( @xmath2 the wavevector , @xmath3 the electronic mass ) is less than a chosen cutoff energy @xmath4 .",
    "the inclusions of gradient corrections within the pseudopotential plane - wave technique has recently been discussed in detail by white and bird  @xcite , who show that a robust and accurate calculation of the ggc exchange - correlation energy and potential can be achieved by summation on exactly the same real - space grid as would be used for the lda .",
    "this technique has been used in the present work .",
    "the first - principles pseudopotentials in kleinman - bylander representation  @xcite were generated using the optimization scheme of lin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in order to reduce the required value of the plane - wave cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "the pseudopotentials used in the ggc calculations were constructed consistently by including gradient corrections in the generation scheme .",
    "the sn pseudopotential was generated using the @xmath5 configuration for @xmath6- and @xmath7-wave components , and the @xmath8 configuration for the @xmath9-wave .",
    "the core radii were equal to 2.1 , 2.1 and 2.5  a.u .",
    "for the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 components respectively .",
    "the ti pseudopotential was generated using the @xmath10 configuration for @xmath6 and @xmath9 waves and the @xmath11 configuration for the @xmath7 wave , with core radii of 2.2 , 1.5 and 2.4 a.u .",
    "for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 waves respectively .",
    "the oxygen pseudopotential used in our lda calculations was generated using the @xmath12 configuration for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 waves and the @xmath13 configuration for the @xmath9 wave , with a single core radius of 1.65  a.u .",
    "for the gradient - corrected oxygen pseudopotential , we have used the single configuration @xmath14 and the same core radius . the use of a core radius of 1.65  a.u .",
    "means that there is an appreciable overlap of the oxygen and metal core spheres in the sno@xmath0 and tio@xmath0 crystals , and in principle this could cause inaccuracies .",
    "however , direct comparisons of the present results with our earlier work on sno@xmath0  @xcite , which employed an oxygen pseudopotential with the smaller core radius of 1.25  a.u . , show that any errors due to core overlap are very small .",
    "the calculations have been done using a plane wave cut - off @xmath4 of 600  ev for sno@xmath0 and 1000  ev for tio@xmath0 .",
    "our tests show that with these cut - offs the energy per unit cell is converged to within 0.2  ev , the convergence with respect to @xmath4 being not noticeably influenced by the inclusion of gradient corrections , even though the gradient corrected pseudopotentials are less smooth and regular than the lda ones  @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using the cetep code  @xcite ( the parallel version of the serial castep code  @xcite ) running on the 64-node intel ipsc/860 machine at daresbury laboratory .",
    "the code uses the band - by - band conjugate - gradient technique to minimize the total energy with respect to plane - wave coefficients .",
    "the lda calculations were performed using the ceperley - alder ( ca ) exchange - correlation function  @xcite .    for the ground",
    "states calculations brillouin zone sampling is performed using the lowest order monkhorst - pack set of k ",
    "points  @xcite , as in our earlier work on sno@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "electronic densities of states ( dos ) associated with the ground state were calculated using the tetrahedron method  @xcite , with @xmath2-point sampling corresponding to 750 tetrahedra in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the 6-atom rutile unit cell of sno@xmath0 and tio@xmath0 is characterized by the two lattice parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the internal parameter @xmath17 : the positions of the four oxygens are @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the equilibrium structure has then been determined by relaxation with respect to the lattice parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the internal parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the equilibrium values of these parameters both with and without gradient corrections are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "as usually happens , there is a tendency for the lda to underestimate the lattice parameter .",
    "this is especially noticeable for sno@xmath0 , where there may also be an effect due to our treatment of the 4@xmath9 shell as part of the core .",
    "the inclusion of gradient corrections tends to increase the lattice parameters , as has already been found for semiconducting and metallic systems  @xcite .",
    "the increase is 4  % or more for the perdew - wang ggc , and leads to results for @xmath15 and @xmath16 that are appreciably greater than experimental values . for the becke - perdew ggc ,",
    "the increase is roughly 3  % .",
    "both the @xmath20 ratio and the @xmath17 parameter are almost unaffected , and this suggests that the gradient corrections have the effect of an isotropic negative pressure , as pointed out by seifert _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the electronic dos for the sno@xmath0 perfect crystal using both lda and the two ggc schemes , but the changes caused by ggc are very small and we do not show the results here .      our calculations on the stoichiometric ( 110 ) surface of both materials have been done with the usual repeating slab geometry . the rutile structure can be regarded as consisting of ( 110 ) planes of atoms containing both metal ( m ) and oxygen ( o ) atoms , separated by planes containing oxygen alone , so that the sequence of planes is o - m@xmath0o@xmath0 - o - o - m@xmath0o@xmath0 - o etc .",
    "the entire crystal can then be built up of symmetrical 3-plane o - m@xmath0o@xmath0 - o units .",
    "the slabs we use contain three of these units , and our repeating cell contains 18 atoms ( 6  m and 12  o ) .",
    "the perfect ( 110 ) surface consists of rows of bridging oxygens lying above a metal - oxygen layer .",
    "the vacuum separating the slabs has been taken wide enough to ensure that interactions between neighboring slabs are small .",
    "the width we use corresponds to two o - m@xmath0o@xmath0 - o units , and is such that planes of bridging oxygens on the surfaces facing each other across the vacuum are separated by about 6.8   .",
    "the surface structure has been determined by relaxing the entire system to equilibrium , and the calculations have been done with and without gradient corrections . as in our previous work on sno@xmath0  ( 110 )  @xcite , and the work of ramamoorthy _",
    "et al . _ on tio@xmath0  ( 110 )  @xcite",
    ", we find displacements of the surface atoms of order 0.1   , with 5-fold and 6-fold coordinated metal atoms ( m@xmath21 and m@xmath22 ) moving respectively into and out of the surface , in - plane oxygens ( o@xmath21 ) moving out and bridging oxygens ( o@xmath22 ) moving very little . the changes of the bond lengths between the surface atoms , including sub - bridging oxygens ( o@xmath23 ) and the uppermost oxygens ( o@xmath24 ) of the following o - m@xmath0o@xmath0 - o unit , for lda and gradient corrected calculations are given in table  [ tab2 ] . from these results",
    ", it is clear that gradient corrections have only a minor effect on the relaxed equilibrium structure .",
    "as we have already noted for the perfect crystal case , modifications of atomic structure with respect to lda results are more pronounced in the pw scheme .",
    "we have calculated the surface formation energy in the standard way , by subtracting from the slab total energy ( 18 atoms ) three times the energy of a 6-atom perfect crystal unit cell and dividing by the total surface area .",
    "we find that the relaxed surface energy of sno@xmath0  ( 110 ) is 1.66  jm@xmath25 in the lda , 1.13  jm@xmath25 in pw - ggc and 1.16  jm@xmath25 for bp - ggc .",
    "the lda result is close to the value of 1.50  jm@xmath25 reported earlier  @xcite . for tio@xmath0  ( 110 ) , the values are 1.14 , 0.82 and 0.84  jm@xmath25 respectively . our lda result for tio@xmath0 ( 110 ) is close to the value of 1.06  jm@xmath25 reported by ramamoorthy _",
    "et al . _",
    "comparison of lda and ggc results shows that gradient corrections have a substantial effect on the surface energies . for both ggc schemes ,",
    "the surface energies are lowered by about 30% with respect to the lda values , the difference between pw and bp being very small .",
    "this decrease of surface energy by ggc is consistent with the general tendency of gradient corrections to remove the systematic overestimation of electronic binding energy in the lda .",
    "the electronic dos of the sno@xmath0  ( 110 ) surface using the lda and the two ggc schemes are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to separate out effects of electronic structure ,",
    "all the calculations are done at the equilibrium lattice parameters and the relaxed positions produced by the bp scheme .",
    "overall , the differences between the three sets of results are small . however , there are significant differences at the top of the valence band and at the top of the o(2s ) band . as we found in our previous work  @xcite",
    "there are peaks at the top of both bands due to surface states , these states being concentrated on the bridging oxygens . the effect of ggc is to reduce the intensity of the peak at the top of o(2s ) band .",
    "the effect on the intensity of the valence band peak is less systematic , since bp increases it but pw decreases it .",
    "the reason why these effects are interesting is that there appears to be no experimental evidence for the surface ",
    "state peak at the top of the valence band , so that the lda predictions seems not to be consistent with experiment .",
    "the present results suggest the possibility that this inconsistency may be due to inaccurate treatament of exchange and correlation .",
    "our calculations show that gradient corrections increase the lattice parameters of tio@xmath0 and sno@xmath0 by @xmath26  4  % for the perdew - wang scheme and @xmath26  3  % for the becke - perdew scheme .",
    "these effects are similar to those reported previously for metals and semiconductors . for the surfaces we examined , gradient corrections have very little effect on the relaxed surface structure , but the surface energies are substantially reduced  by @xmath26  30  % in both the perdew - wang and the becke - perdew schemes .",
    "the effects of gradient corrections on the electronic dos of sno@xmath0  ( 110 ) surface are very small , except at the top of the o(2s ) and o(2p ) bands .",
    "the changes we find at the top of the o(2p ) band may be relevant to apparent inconsistences between calculated and experimental results for the surface dos in this region .",
    "the work of jg is supported by epsrc grant gr / j34842 . the major calculations were performed on the intel ipsc/860 parallel computer at daresbury laboratory , and we are grateful for a generous allocation of time on the machine .",
