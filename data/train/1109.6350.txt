    "comet p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) , hereafter p / la sagra , was discovered by j.  nomen in images obtained on 2010 september 14.9 ( ut ) using the 0.45  m la sagra observatory in southern spain @xcite . with a semimajor axis of @xmath10  au , eccentricity of @xmath11 , inclination of @xmath12 , and a tisserand parameter ( with respect to jupiter ) of @xmath13",
    ", it was immediately suspected to be a member of the recently identified class of main - belt comets ( mbcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are objects that exhibit cometary activity likely due to the sublimation of volatile ice , yet are dynamically indistinguishable from main - belt asteroids . prior to the discovery of p / la sagra , four mbcs",
    " 133p / elst - pizarro , 176p / linear , 238p / read , and p/2008 r1 ( garradd )  were recognized , while a sixth possible mbc ( p/2006  vw@xmath14 ) has just recently been identified @xcite . two other comet - like main - belt objects  p/2010 a2 ( linear ) and ( 596 ) scheila  have also been observed , but as their comet - like morphologies are believed to be due to impact - generated ejecta clouds @xcite , and not cometary ( i.e. , sublimation - driven ) dust emission , they are better characterized as disrupted asteroids .",
    "observationally distinguishing mbcs and disrupted asteroids is not straightforward as both types of objects exhibit visible dust emission in the form of comet - like features like comae and tails .",
    "distinctive morphological features helped betray the true natures of p/2010  a2 and scheila , however ( * ? ? ? * and references within ) . in the case of p/2010 a2 , a gap between what appeared to be the nucleus of the `` comet '' and the dust tail indicated that the observed dust emission was possibly an impulsively - generated ejecta cloud that produced by an impact onto p/2010 a2 s surface and was then drifting away .",
    "this hypothesis was later corroborated by numerical dust modeling and other physical arguments @xcite . in the case of scheila",
    ", no gap was seen between the nucleus and its emitted dust , but instead of forming a single tail , the dust emitted from scheila appeared to form multiple plumes .",
    "@xcite considered various scenarios that could produce multiple dust plumes , finding scenarios for sublimation - driven dust emission to be physically implausible as they required multiple active sites , which were argued to be unlikely on scheila . instead",
    ", a simpler scenario in which a single oblique impact caused dust emission in the form of a hollow cone which was then pushed back in the antisolar direction by radiation pressure was favored @xcite . in this scenario , what appeared to be",
    "multiple plumes of dust were proposed to simply be optical projection effects ( i.e. , limb brightening of the hollow dust structure ) .",
    "early observation reports for p / la sagra indicated that it exhibited a largely classical cometary morphology , with a visible coma and tail @xcite , suggesting that it could be a true comet @xcite , and was therefore likely to be just the fifth mbc to be discovered at that time .",
    "numerical modeling by @xcite furthermore showed that the evolution of p / la sagra s dust tail was consistent with sublimation - driven dust emission , though they did not explicitly test impulsive impact - driven emission scenarios . in this paper , we seek to further assess whether p / la sagra s dust emission is likely to be cometary ( sublimation - driven ) in nature , or if the object could instead be a disrupted asteroid .",
    "we also conduct observational and dynamical characterization analyses of the object to place it in the context of the small but growing known population of comet - like objects in the main asteroid belt .",
    "imaging observations of p / la sagra were made in photometric conditions on multiple occasions in 2010 and 2011 ( table  [ obslog ] ) by the 2.0  m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) on haleakala in hawaii , the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2  m telescope , the 8  m gemini - north observatory , and the 10  m keck i telescope , all on mauna kea in hawaii , the 1.54  m danish telescope at la silla observatory in chile , and the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma in the canary islands ( spain ) .",

    "sidereal tracking was used by ps1 because this was the standard mode of operation for survey operations .",
    "ftn observations were obtained using its web - based remote control interface , through which non - sidereal tracking is not possible .",
    "the int is normally capable of tracking solar system objects non - sidereally , but was unable to do so during our observing run due to mechanical problems .",
    "we performed standard image preparation ( bias subtraction and flat - field reduction ) for uh 2.2  m , gemini , keck , danish 1.54  m , and int data using image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software . for keck data ,",
    "flat fields were constructed from images of the illuminated interior of the keck i dome , while for the other telescopes , dithered images of the twilight sky were used to construct flat fields .",

    "comet photometry was performed using both rectangular and circular apertures as described below , where to avoid dust contamination from the comet itself , background sky statistics are measured manually in regions of blank sky near , but not adjacent , to the object .",
    "several ( 5 to 10 ) field stars in the comet images were also measured to correct for any extinction variation ( typically negligible ) during each night .",
    "in addition to imaging observations , we also secured optical spectra of p / la sagra on 2010 october 05 with lris on keck .",
    "we adopted lris s @xmath31-wide long - slit mask , the 400/3400 grism , and the 460 dichroic on the blue side , giving a dispersion of 1.08   pixel@xmath6 and a spectral resolution of approximately 7  .",
    "a total of 3600  s of data were obtained from four integrations on the comet while it was at an airmass of @xmath321.1 .",
    "unfortunately , when taking calibration images , our observations were interrupted due to fog and we were forced to close the dome for over three hours . as such , we were only able to record a spectrum of a flux standard star and failed to obtain any spectra of nearby g - type standard stars , complicating our reduction and analysis ( section  [ specreduction ] ) .",
    "data reduction was accomplished using iraf .",
    "for each night during which observations were obtained , we construct composite images by aligning each night s set of images on the object s photocenter and adding them together .",
    "we see that p / la sagra is clearly morphologically cometary between august 2010 and february 2011 ( figure  [ images1 ] ) , with a dust tail extending up to @xmath33 ( @xmath34  km at the geocentric distance of the object at the time ) from the nucleus s photocenter .",
    "the projected orientation of this dust tail on the plane of the sky is seen to rotate counterclockwise throughout this period , lagging slightly behind the similarly rotating antisolar vector ( as projected on the sky ) . from august 2010 through november 2010",
    ", we observe a single dust tail aligned with the projection of the antisolar vector in the sky , while between december 2010 and february 2011 , an apparent dust trail aligned with the projection of the heliocentric velocity vector ( i.e. , the plane of the object s orbit ) appears in addition to the antisolar dust tail . by august 2011 ( figure  [ images2 ] )",
    ", active dust emission appears to have ceased , though a residual dust trail ( presumably consisting of large dust particles ejected during earlier activity ) aligned with the projection of the object s heliocentric velocity vector in the sky is observed extending at least @xmath321  arcmin ( @xmath35  km at the geocentric distance of the object at the time ) from the nucleus .",
    "this dust trail peaks in brightness well away ( @xmath36 ) from the nucleus .    in the formulation of dust dynamics outlined by @xcite ,",
    "the trajectory of an emitted dust particle depends on the orbit of the emitting comet , the particle s ejection time , its ejection velocity , and the ratio , @xmath37 , of solar radiation pressure , @xmath38 , to solar gravity , @xmath39 , on the particle . in cases where @xmath37 is small ( i.e. , for massive particles )",
    ", radiation pressure is negligible , causing particles follow orbits very close that of the comet . over time",
    ", these large grains will spread out along the comet s orbit to form a potentially observable trail . in cases where @xmath37 is large ( i.e. , for small particles )",
    ", radiation pressure is dominant over solar gravity , giving particles nearly directly antisolar motion in the rest frame of the comet . in the case of p",
    "/ la sagra , we observe both limiting cases : a tail consistently oriented in the antisolar direction ( likely composed of small , high-@xmath37 particles ) from august 2010 through february 2011 ( figure  [ images1 ] ) , and a trail confined to the orbit plane ( likely composed of large , low-@xmath37 particles ) from december 2010 through august 2011 ( figures  [ images1 ] and [ images2 ] ) .",
    "this assessment is in agreement with the modeling results obtained by @xcite who found dust grain sizes ranging from @xmath325  @xmath40 m to @xmath321  cm .",
    "similar dust structures comprising widely - varying particle sizes have also been observed for comets 2p / encke @xcite and c / austin 1990 v @xcite .    due to the ease by which they are accelerated by radiation pressure , the small particles comprising an antisolar tail are expected to dissipate quickly ( on timescales of several weeks at the distance of the main belt ; cf .",
    "* ) unless they are continually replenished .",
    "no such separation of the antisolar tail from the nucleus is observed at any time from august 2010 through february 2011 , a span of 5.5 months , strongly suggesting that continuous dust production was ongoing over this time period , consistent with cometary activity .",
    "we note that the persistence of the orbit - aligned dust trail until august 2011 does not mean that dust production continued up until this time as well . in this latter case",
    ", the longevity of the dust trail is instead likely due to the large sizes and therefore slow dissipation rates of the particles in the trail ( cf .  p/2010 a2 ; * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not continuous replenishment .",
    "qualitatively , we find that p / la sagra s morphological appearance and evolution strongly suggest that its dust emission is cometary in nature .",
    "we caution however that more detailed dust modeling ( similar that performed by * ? ? ?",
    "* but also considering impulsive emission scenarios ) will be required for quantitative confirmation of the conclusions reached here .",
    "vigorous activity , such as that exhibited by p / la sagra during the majority of our 2010 and 2011 observations , normally interferes with the measurement of physical properties for cometary nuclei ( e.g. , size , rotation period , and phase darkening behavior ) due to obscuration caused by coma when such activity is present . as such , in order to accurately measure the physical properties of comet nuclei , it is typically necessary to observe them once activity has mostly or entirely ceased , as we did with p / la sagra in august 2011 using the keck i and gemini telescopes ( table  [ obslog ] ) .",
    "we measure a mean apparent @xmath26-band magnitude ( averaged in flux space and weighted by nominal uncertainties ) of @xmath41  mag , with a magnitude variation between the two nights of @xmath42  mag ( @xmath43  mag on 2011 august 26 , and @xmath44  mag on 2011 aug 31 ) . provided that the photometric variation between these two nights is real ( intra - night variations are on the order of @xmath320.2  mag , with observations on each night only spanning 30  min or less ) and due to rotation , the minimum ratio of the axes of the body as projected in the plane of the sky",
    "is then given by @xmath45 giving us a lower limit ( due to unknown projection effects ) to the axis ratio for p / la sagra of @xmath46 .",
    "given the extremely limited data set on which this calculation is based , this axis ratio should of course be considered as a preliminary result only .",
    "better constraints on the shape and structure of the nucleus of p / la sagra will require additional observational sampling of the object s lightcurve ( likely requiring large telescopes , given the small size of the object ) , ideally at multiple observing geometries .    using the range of slope parameter ( @xmath47 ) values in the iau @xmath48 photometric system computed for fellow mbcs 133p , 176p , 238p , and p / garradd ( @xmath49 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find an estimated absolute magnitude of @xmath1  mag .",
    "adopting a @xmath26-band albedo of @xmath50 ( as measured for 133p and 176p ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we then find an approximate effective nucleus radius of @xmath51  km , making it comparable in size to 238p , about three times larger than p / garradd , and about three times smaller than 133p and 176p ( table  [ orbelems ] ) .",
    "using the approximate axis ratio derived above and assuming a triaxial ellipsoidal shape , we find semimajor and semiminor axes for the nucleus of @xmath52  km and @xmath53  km , respectively .",
    "we note that photometric variations on the scale of @xmath54  mag were not seen at any time while p / la sagra was active ( august 2010 through february 2011 ) for any observations that were comparably closely spaced in time as the august 2011 observations analyzed above . for example , observations on four separate occasions between 2010 sep 08 and sep 29 exhibited a maximum variation of just @xmath55  mag ( table  [ photresults ] ) .",
    "this lack of corroborating detections of significant photometric variation during that period does not invalidate our detection of a @xmath54  mag variation in august 2011 , however , since rotational variations for a nucleus obscured by a steady - state coma ( assumed to be optically thin ) will be effectively damped by that coma .",
    "the extent of this damping can be determined using @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the observed photometric range , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the maximum and minimum fluxes observed for the active comet , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the maximum and minimum fluxes for which the nucleus is responsible , and the flux due to dust , @xmath62 , is assumed to be constant @xcite .",
    "assuming that the nucleus and dust grains have similar albedos , flux terms in equation  [ damping ] can be considered equivalent to the corresponding scattering surface areas of the comet components being considered .",
    "we find in the following section ( section  [ activityevolution ] ) that the ratio of scattering surface areas of dust and the nucleus during the four september observations discussed above was @xmath63 ( table  [ photresults ] ) .",
    "thus , using @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , we find @xmath67  mag .",
    "in other words , during this period , even the minor @xmath55  mag photometric variation we observed for the object is unlikely to be due to the rotation of the nucleus .",
    "instead , we surmise that the observed variation is more likely due to fluctuations in the seeing conditions between the different nights , causing fluctuations in the amount of coma contained within the fixed @xmath68 photometry apertures we used to measure the near - nucleus flux of the comet in all of our images .",
    "we also conclude that our non - detection of significant photometric variations in data obtained when p / la sagra was active is not inconsistent with our apparent detection of a significant photometric variation while the object was inactive .",
    "multi - filter observations using lris on keck i also permitted us to measure a @xmath69  mag color for p / la sagra s inactive nucleus , which within our uncertainties , is consistent with the color of the sun ( @xmath70  mag ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the colors we measure for p / la sagra s dust coma while it was active are also approximately solar ( @xmath71  mag on 2010 october 5 and @xmath72  mag on 2011 feb 3 ) , in good agreement with colors measured for the other mbcs @xcite .      using the nucleus size computed above in section  [ nucleussize ] , the expected apparent nucleus magnitude for p",
    "/ la sagra at the time of our first observations in august 2010 is @xmath73  mag , not @xmath74  mag as measured ( table  [ photresults ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that there was significant near - nucleus dust contamination even during our earliest observations of p / la sagra . assuming that the phase behavior of p / la sagra s dust coma is similar to that of the nuclei of other mbcs whose phase functions have been measured ( cf .",
    "section  [ nucleussize ] ; since we lack other meaningful constraints ) , we calculate the comet s corresponding absolute magnitudes , @xmath75 , at heliocentric and geocentric distances of @xmath76  au and phase angles of @xmath77 for each set of photometric measurements ( using photometry apertures with radii of @xmath68 ) of the nucleus ( table  [ photresults ] ) . by comparing these absolute magnitudes to our estimated absolute magnitude for the nucleus ,",
    "we then compute the ratio of the scattering surface area of dust in the coma , @xmath78 , to that of the nucleus , @xmath79 , using @xmath80 then , assuming @xmath81 and @xmath82  @xmath40m - radius grains with bulk densities of @xmath83  kg  m@xmath84 ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate the total dust mass , @xmath85 , in the coma using @xmath86 we list the values we compute for @xmath87 and @xmath85 using the above procedures in table  [ photresults ] . comparing the minimum and maximum values of @xmath85 during our observations",
    ", we find that p / la sagra s coma increases in mass at an average net rate of @xmath88  kg  s@xmath6 ( likely precise to an order of magnitude , at best ) between august and december 2010 .",
    "this net increase in total dust mass represents the sum of the positive contribution of new dust production from the nucleus and the negative contribution of dust dissipation as individual grains disperse beyond the photometry aperture .",
    "as such , it represents a lower limit to the true dust production rate of the nucleus .    in addition to performing nucleus photometry",
    ", we also measure the total flux from the comet in our composite images from each night .",
    "we do so by using rectangular photometry apertures enclosing the entire visible dust cloud and oriented to avoid field star contamination .",
    "background sky levels were then measured from nearby areas of blank sky and subtracted to obtain net fluxes , which were then calibrated using standard stars to obtain absolute photometry ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the faintness of the residual dust trail observed on 2011 august 26 and 31 , and extensive contamination by nearby bright field stars means that we are unable to perform these measurements for data obtained on those dates .",
    "repeating the mass production rate analysis described above , we find that p / la sagra s coma and tail increase in mass at about twice the rate measured for the near - nucleus coma , or an average net rate of @xmath90  kg  s@xmath6 .",
    "since this analysis does not rely on a fixed aperture size , this net mass loss rate is closer to the true dust production rate of the nucleus than that computed above , though still represents a lower limit due to the unknown dissipation rate of the dust as individual grains disperse from the coma and tail and become undetectable above the sky background . comparing with other mbcs , we nonetheless find that p / la sagra has a dust production rate comparable to or larger than that of 238p @xcite , and at least an order of magnitude larger than those of 133p and 176p @xcite .    for reference",
    ", we also use our measurements of the near - nucleus flux of the comet ( using @xmath68 photometry apertures ) in each set of observations to estimate the dust contribution as parameterized by @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "these results are also shown in table  [ photresults ] , and again indicate significantly stronger activity for p / la sagra as compared to 133p , for which @xmath91 was also systematically tabulated @xcite .",
    "we also attempt to reproduce our observed photometry using a sublimation model similar to that used by @xcite to analyze the activity of 238p .",
    "this effort was hampered , however , by our lack of observational constraints on the start time of activity and the rate of its eventual decline .",
    "we do find that steadily increasing activity during the post - perihelion portion of p / la sagra s orbit can not be modeled by surface ice sublimation , indicating that the ice must instead reside at some depth below the surface of the nucleus , similar to what was found for 238p @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the numerous free parameters that can be modified in our model mean that this finding is the only meaningful result that can be derived at this time . better sampling of the activity over a longer time baseline will be required to gain additional insight into the nature of p / la sagra s activity via this method , and as such , should be considered an observational priority during its next expected period of activity ( likely beginning in mid-2015 ) .",
    "we note that if p / la sagra exhibits activity over a period of @xmath92  year during each of its perihelion passages ( similar to 133p ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming an average mass loss rate of @xmath93  kg  s@xmath6 , a total mass loss of @xmath94  kg per orbit would be expected . assuming a nucleus size of @xmath95  km ( section  [ nucleussize ] ) and @xmath83  kg  m@xmath84 , such a mass loss rate should consume the entire nucleus over the next @xmath96  orbits , or @xmath97  yr .",
    "however , activity in mbcs ( even over just a portion of their orbits ) is expected to be transient ( cf .",
    "* ) , perhaps amounting to just 1% of an object s total lifetime @xcite . as such , we expect a timescale for nucleus disintegration due to cometary activity closer to @xmath98  yr @xcite , or approximately comparable to the @xmath98-@xmath99  yr collisional lifetime expected for a main - belt asteroid the size of p / la sagra s nucleus @xcite .      to further understand p / la sagra s place among the population of known mbcs , we plot @xmath87 for the first five known mbcs as functions of true anomaly , @xmath100 ( figure  [ activity_comparison]a ) .",
    "we note a few interesting features of this plot .",
    "first , we find quantitative confirmation that for their nucleus sizes , 238p and p / garradd exhibit far more dust when active than 133p and 176p ( also see table  [ orbelems ] ) .",
    "this fact has of course always been qualitatively apparent .",
    "the observed morphologies of 238p and p / garradd , when active , resemble those of highly active comets @xcite , whereas the nuclei of 133p and 176p dominate the surface brightness profiles of those objects , even at the peaks of their active periods",
    ". only comparatively faint dust tails and small amounts of photometrically - detected unresolved near - nucleus dust have attested to the cometary natures of these latter mbcs @xcite . as for p",
    "/ la sagra , we find that it exceeds even 238p and p / garradd in the amount of dust it produces for the size of its nucleus , producing @xmath101 times as much dust relative to its nucleus size at its peak as 238p and p / garradd produced at their peaks , which in turn were @xmath102 times as productive relative to their nucleus sizes as 133p and 176p .",
    "we caution that given the different geocentric distances at which the observations in question were made , the near - nucleus photometry performed for each mbc measures dust contained within different physical distances from the nucleus . as such , considering that other physical characteristics of the dust emission ( e.g. , grain sizes , bulk grain densities , and ejection velocities ) for each mbc are unknown and likely also vary from object to object , these comparisons are best interpreted in terms of orders of magnitude .",
    "we therefore find 238p , p / garradd , and p / la sagra to have similar levels of activity which are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of 133p and 176p , implying similar ratios of fractional active surface areas for these objects .    to quantify the total amount of ejected dust exhibited by each comet",
    ", we also multiply the @xmath87 values for each comet by estimates of @xmath79 for each object ( derived from nucleus radii listed in table  [ orbelems ] ) to obtain absolute values for @xmath78 .",
    "we plot the results as functions of true anomaly in figure  [ activity_comparison]b .",
    "interestingly , we find that despite the high @xmath87 values measured for 238p and p / garradd , the total absolute amount of dust in those comets is approximately comparable to the amounts of dust present for 133p and 176p , which visually appear far less active in comparison .",
    "p / la sagra is seen to produce roughly an order of magnitude more dust in absolute terms than any of the other mbcs ( assuming similar particle size distributions ) .",
    "we therefore find the interesting result that within an order of magnitude , all five mbcs considered here exhibit similar total amounts of visible dust in their comae and tails , despite the wide variation in their observed morphologies . determining whether this finding is physically significant will require similar dust mass measurements for newly - discovered mbcs to investigate whether this trend is maintained as the sample of known objects grows .",
    "we suggest that future research investigating the validity and implications of this possible trend may provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of mbc activity .        in the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum ,",
    "the emission band of the cn radical at 3880  @xmath103 is among the strongest among cometary gaseous species and therefore is considered to be the most sensitive probe for detecting gas resulting from sublimating ice .",
    "we search for evidence of the presence of the cn band in a one dimensional spectrum extracted from the spectral image using a @xmath104 rectangular aperture centered on the continuum .",
    "we use a relatively wide extraction aperture to incorporate as much light as possible from the surrounding coma .",
    "the sky background is reconstructed and subtracted using flanking regions extending from @xmath105 to @xmath106 from the nucleus .    in figure [ r2_f1 ] , we present the spectrum of p / la sagra in the relevant spectral region from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "the continuum of the comet consists of scattered sunlight from dust particles in the inner coma and shows several absorption features in the solar spectrum , such as the prominent ca h and k absorption lines at 3933  @xmath103 and 3966  @xmath103 ( figure [ r2_f1 ] ) .",
    "the shaded spectral region from 3830  @xmath103 to 3905  @xmath103 indicates where we expect to detect cn emission if any is present @xcite .    in order to correct for solar spectral features ,",
    "the spectrum of a g2v solar analog star is needed . as discussed in section  [ obs ]",

    "to better understand the likely origin of p / la sagra , we also consider its dynamical properties .",

    "as such , an important issue to consider is whether p / la sagra is dynamically stable at its present location , or whether it is possible that it may have also originated elsewhere .    to assess p / la sagra s dynamical stability , we randomly generate three sets of 100 test particles , each set with gaussian distributions in orbital element space , centered on p / la sagra s jpl - tabulated osculating orbital elements , where each set is characterized by a @xmath121 value equal to the jpl - tabulated uncertainties ( as of 2011 january 1 ) for each orbital element .",
    "to investigate the stability of the region ( in orbital element space ) surrounding p / la sagra , we also generate three additional sets of 100 gaussian - distributed test particles each , where each set is again centered on p / la sagra s osculating orbital elements but is characterized by a @xmath121 value equal to @xmath161 the jpl - tabulated uncertainties .",
    "we then use the n - body integration package , mercury @xcite , to integrate the orbits of each set of test particles forward in time for 100 myr ( limitations on available computing resources unfortunately prevent us from conducting these simulations over significantly longer time periods , _ e.g. _ , 1 - 2  gyr , in a reasonable amount of time ) , where we treat the eight major planets as massive particles and all test particles are considered to be massless .    performing these integrations for all six sets of test particles , we find that 7% of the objects in the three 1-@xmath121 test particle sets are ejected ( _ i.e. _ , reach a heliocentric distance of @xmath162  au ) from the asteroid belt over the course of 100  myrs ( figure  [ stability_1sig ] ) , and 11% of the objects in the three 100-@xmath121 test particle sets are ejected ( figure  [ stability_100sig ] ) .",

    "* ) , where a body is generally considered to be stable for @xmath164  kyr .",
    "the 1-@xmath121 test particles that are ejected are not localized to particular regions of orbital element space near p / la sagra , suggesting that their ejection may be a consequence of stochastic encounters with a weak mean - motion resonance ( or multiple resonances ) , rather than the effect of a single dominant resonance .",
    "nearby resonances include the `` moderate - order '' 13:6 mean - motion resonance with jupiter at @xmath165  au and the ( 3,-2,-1 ) three - body mean - motion resonance ( with jupiter and saturn ) at @xmath166  au @xcite .",
    "both resonances are more than 1-@xmath121 away in @xmath167 , given the uncertainties for p / la sagra s osculating elements , but could conceivably affect the object as its osculating elements fluctuate over time ( figure  [ a_evolution ] ) .    in our 100-@xmath121 test particle simulations ,",

    "p / la sagra itself has an initial osculating semimajor axis 0.06  au of the 13:6 resonance , and even occasionally crosses the resonance during our simulations ( figure  [ a_evolution ] ) , yet is found to be stable over the 100  myr test period considered here , suggesting that this resonance only weakly affects objects in this region of orbital element space .",
    "we conclude from this analysis that the region in orbital element space occupied by p / la sagra is largely stable , implying that the object is likely to be native to its present - day location . as such",

    "however , between the nearby 13:6 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and ( 3,-2,-1 ) three - body mean - motion resonance with jupiter and saturn , enough dynamical instability is imparted to the region that a non - negligible fraction of simulated test particles escape in less than 100 myr . due to the non - negligible instability of this region , we therefore can not definitively conclude that p / la sagra formed in situ ( and did not dynamically evolve onto its present - day orbit from elsewhere in the main belt , or even elsewhere in the solar system ) , particularly over timescales longer than the 100  myr test period considered in this analysis .",
    "we further note that our analysis does not consider non - gravitational effects such as the yarkovsky effect or the effects of asymmetric mass loss such as that associated with cometary jets . as such , in future investigations of this object , particularly those which pertain to the comparison of its physical properties to those of other mbcs , the possibility that p / la sagra may not be native to its current location can not be discounted .",
    "having investigated the dynamical stability of p / la sagra and its surroundings , we seek to further characterize the object s dynamical environment by searching for evidence of an associated asteroid family , i.e. , a grouping of dynamically linked asteroids likely to be the result of either the catastrophic fragmentation of a larger parent asteroid @xcite , or a significant cratering event on a still - existing asteroid ( _ e.g. _ , vesta ; * ? ? ?",

    "we find no such associations .",
    "finding no link between p / la sagra and any currently known asteroid families , we turn to our own search for dynamically associated asteroids to determine whether a clustering specific to p / la sagra may have missed simply because this newly discovered object was not considered in previous family searches .",
    "to do so , we add our computed proper elements for p / la sagra to an updated list of synthetic proper elements for high - inclination asteroids @xcite , and then employ the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to search for dynamically associated asteroids .",

    "this group of objects is neither compact nor large enough to be classified as a family or clump .",
    "at best , it can be classified as a cluster , defined by @xcite as a compact group of objects that could share a common physical origin , but does not formally satisfy criteria for being a family or clump , usually because the number of members that it contains is too small .    to obtain a quantitative assessment of the likelihood that members of the p / la sagra group share a common physical origin , we use a method employed by @xcite to estimate the probability that a certain cluster of objects is the result of random chance .",
    "confining our analysis to the high - inclination region of the outer main belt ( @xmath174 au , @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) , we generate 10,000 random distributions of 9569 synthetic objects ( the same number of objects currently known to populate this region ) in proper orbital element space .",
    "we then perform hcm analysis on these synthetic populations to search for possible groupings with at least 6 objects within cutoff distances of 95  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "the results of this analysis show that there is a significant probability ( @xmath177% ) that the p / la sagra cluster could in fact be due to chance .",
    "while these results still leave a @xmath178% chance that this grouping is not random and therefore could have a physical origin , more information is certainly needed to establish whether or not this clustering can be considered real .",
    "we compute lyapunov times for members of the p / la sagra group ( table  [ lasagcluster ] ) , finding the orbits of all six bodies to be stable ( @xmath179100 kyr ) .",
    "this fact provides an opportunity to apply the backward integration method ( bim ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to this group .",
    "bim is a means for estimating the age of a @xmath18020-myr - old family that is based on the premise that immediately after the disruption of a parent body , the orbits of the resulting fragments must have been nearly the same , and has been successfully applied to estimate the ages of the karin cluster and veritas family @xcite .    in the case of the group of asteroids surrounding p / la sagra ,",
    "the purpose of bim analysis is twofold .",
    "if a suspicious clustering in the longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath181 ) or the longitude of perihelion ( @xmath182 ) can be found , this analysis would not only allow us to estimate the age of the group , but would also provide support for the hypothesis that these objects share a physical origin in the first place . in the outer belt ,",
    "however , application of this method is generally complicated by large gradients of secular frequencies with @xmath183 , particularly when considering @xmath182 in the vicinity of the 2:1 resonance with jupiter @xcite .",
    "although the p / la sagra group is not particularly close to this resonance , the gradient @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the frequency of the longitude of perihelion , is still relatively large in this region ( @xmath320.1  yr@xmath6  au@xmath6 ) . as such , for the purpose of our study we only consider @xmath181 .    to investigate whether or not a clustering in @xmath181 exists",
    ", we numerically integrate the orbits of all six known members of the p / la sagra group for 20 myr backward in time .",

    "the clusterings at about 4.9 and 18.2  myr ago are less significant than the one occurring about 6.2  myr ago .",
    "this implies that the age of the cluster is likely close to 6.2 myr , but due to the small number of asteroids involved , it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion about the physical significance of this cluster .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ clustering ] are obtained in a purely gravitational model . including other forces",
    "( _ e.g. _ , the yarkovsky effect ) could affect the positions and depths of various minima ( _ cf_. * ? ? ?",
    "we believe , however , that such an analysis should be deferred pending the discovery of more members of the cluster so that more statistically meaningful results can be obtained than are currently achievable with just six possible cluster members . in the meantime",
    ", the determination of colors or acquisition of spectra of the currently suspected cluster members could provide some preliminary insights into the likelihood that these objects are physically related .",
    "to date , the only published analysis of p / la sagra prior to this work was presented by @xcite , who focused on numerical modeling of object s dust emission .",
    "they found that the activity can be plausibly modeled by an episode of continuous dust emission , consistent with a sublimation - driven dust ejection process and inconsistent with impulsive dust ejection as would be expected from an impact , beginning shortly before the object s perihelion passage and persisting over @xmath1907  months .",
    "furthermore , they found that the dust cloud s morphology was best reproduced by anistropic dust emission and indicated that their modeling suggests that p / la sagra s activity could be seasonally modulated in a manner similar to that of other mbcs ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our photometric analysis of the dust cloud ( section  [ activityevolution ] )",
    ", we found steadily increasing dust mass between august 2011 and december 2011 , indicative of ongoing dust production , and consistent with the conclusion by @xcite that p / la sagra s dust emission appears to have persisted over an extended period of time , and therefore was likely to be cometary ( _ i.e. _ , sublimation - driven ) in nature .    while the conclusion that p / la sagra s dust emission is driven by the sublimation of volatile ices appears to be at odds with the results of our spectroscopic analysis ( section  [ spectroscopy ] ) , we note that the extreme difficulty of detecting sublimation products in a cometary coma at the distance of the main belt means that the non - detection of gas emission in such observations can not be considered conclusive evidence against the presence of gas ( _ cf_. * ? ? ?",
    "rather , such non - detections should only be interpreted as evidence that the levels of gas emission for all mbcs for which spectroscopy has been obtained to date ( 133p , p / garradd , and p / la sagra ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) have simply been below the sensitivity levels of those observations .",
    "however , the aforementioned observations were all obtained using large ground - based telescopes ( the european southern observatory s 8  m very large telescope in chile , and the 10  m keck i telescope in hawaii ) , and so future attempts to detect gas in mbcs may need to focus on significantly more active mbcs ( _ i.e. _ , with higher gas emission levels ) since significantly more powerful observing facilities are not currently available .",
    "it may also be possible that given the large distances and low activity levels ( relative to other comets observed at much smaller heliocentric and geocentric distances ) of the mbcs , conclusive evidence of gas emission may only ever be obtainable from a close - approaching spacecraft equipped to make such measurements .    despite the lack of a successful gas detection ( section  [ spectroscopy ] ) ,",
    "we conclude from the numerical modeling of @xcite and the morphological and photometric analyses presented in this work ( sections  [ imageanalysis ] and [ photometry ] ) that p / la sagra s activity is likely to be sublimation - driven . as such",
    ", the object is likely to be a bona fide mbc like 133p , 176p , 238p , and p / garradd , where dust is ejected via gas drag from sublimating ice , and not as ejecta from a recent impact as is suspected in the cases of disrupted asteroids , p/2010 a2 and ( 596 ) scheila ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "given the case of p/2010 a2 s long - lived dust tail @xcite , the longevity of p / la sagra s activity is likewise not incontrovertible evidence of sublimation - driven dust emission .",
    "even the apparently steadily increasing dust mass in p / la sagra s coma and tail ( section  [ activityevolution ] ) could be considered inconclusive evidence of sublimation given the potential that fragmenting dust particles ejected in an impulsive event could mimic ongoing dust production as in the case of the 2007 outburst of comet 17p / holmes @xcite .    at this time",
    ", recurrent activity , separated by intervening periods of inactivity , appears to be the only reliably observable indicator of sublimation - driven dust emission that can not also be plausibly explained by a scenario involving impact - driven dust ejection @xcite .",
    "repeated impacts on individual asteroids are unexpected from either theoretical calculations or empirical observations .",
    "the tendency of episodes of repeated activity to occur over similar arcs of each object s orbit makes such behavior even more difficult to explain as the action of random impacts rather than the effect of periodic cometary sublimation .",

    "the steadily increasing scattering surface area measured for the dust cloud over much of this period suggests that dust production was ongoing over a period of several months , behavior consistent with dust ejection via the sublimation of volatile ice and inconsistent with dust ejection via the impulsive action of an impact on the surface of p / la sagra .",

    "<S> we present observations of the recently discovered comet - like main - belt object p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) obtained by pan - starrs 1 and the faulkes telescope - north on haleakala in hawaii , the university of hawaii 2.2  m , gemini - north , and keck i telescopes on mauna kea , the danish 1.54  m telescope ( operated by the mindstep consortium ) at la silla , and the isaac newton telescope on la palma . </S>",
    "<S> an antisolar dust tail is observed to be present from august 2010 through february 2011 , while a dust trail aligned with the object s orbit plane is also observed from december 2010 through august 2011 . assuming typical phase darkening behavior , p / la sagra is seen to increase in brightness by @xmath0  mag between august 2010 and december 2010 , suggesting that dust production is ongoing over this period . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly suggest that the observed activity is cometary in nature ( _ i.e. _ , driven by the sublimation of volatile material ) , and that p / la sagra is therefore the most recent main - belt comet to be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> we find an approximate absolute magnitude for the nucleus of @xmath1  mag , corresponding to a nucleus radius of @xmath2  km , assuming an albedo of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the observed scattering surface areas of the dust coma to that of the nucleus when p / la sagra was active , we find dust - to - nucleus area ratios of @xmath4 , comparable to those computed for fellow main - belt comets 238p / read and p/2008 r1 ( garradd ) , and one to two orders of magnitude larger than for two other main - belt comets ( 133p / elst - pizarro and 176p / linear ) . using optical spectroscopy to search for cn emission , we do not detect any conclusive evidence of sublimation products ( i.e. , gas emission ) , finding an upper limit cn production rate of @xmath5  mol  s@xmath6 , from which we infer an h@xmath7o production rate of @xmath8  mol  s@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations indicate that p / la sagra is dynamically stable for @xmath9  myr , suggesting that it is likely native to its current location and that its composition is likely representative of other objects in the same region of the main belt , though the relatively close proximity of the 13:6 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and the ( 3,-2,-1 ) three - body mean - motion resonance with jupiter and saturn mean that dynamical instability on larger timescales can not be ruled out . </S>"
