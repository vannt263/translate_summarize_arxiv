    "the uncertainties in @xmath0 due to the thermal structure of the ic gas are found to be much smaller than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the cluster a1689 was observed in the @xmath8 and @xmath3 mm bands .",
    "the @xmath2 mm band observations were used to determine the position of the peak s - z surface brightness .",
    "the pspc and s - z peak surface brightnesses are nearly coincident .",
    "fits to the s - z surface brightness indicate the observed morphology is consistent with the density model determined from the x - ray observations and isothermal ic gas . simultaneously fitting to the @xmath8 and @xmath3 mm data , we determine @xmath291 and @xmath292 at @xmath6 confidence .    unlike the determination of @xmath13 , the determination of cluster peculiar velocities does not place high demands on the quality of the x - ray data .",
    "the results are constant over the allowed range of x - ray derived density models . for both clusters ,",
    "we have determined @xmath0 over a broad range of x - ray temperature ; the value of the peculiar velocity depends weakly on the assumed @xmath61 .",
    "astrophysical confusion of the peculiar velocity measurements in the two clusters is likely to be dominated by primary anisotropies of the cmb at a level @xmath393 .",
    "all the sources of uncertainty to the determination of cluster peculiar velocities , that we have considered , are listed in table  [ evpec ] . including uncertainties due to the uncertainty in the ic gas temperature , thermal structure , density model , calibration , and astrophysical confusion , we find @xmath5 for a2163 , and @xmath9 for a1689 , both at @xmath6 confidence .    even though we have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to determine individual peculiar velocities , it is possible to use results like those presented here , to probe the velocity field on very large scales .",
    "for example , lauer & postman ( 1994 ) ( lp ) report a bulk flow of galaxy clusters within a sphere of @xmath394 of @xmath395 .",
    "a2163 and a1689 lie along lines of sight separated from the direction of the lp bulk flow by only @xmath396 and @xmath397 respectively .",
    "if we assume that all the radial peculiar velocity of the clusters is due to a bulk flow in the direction of the lp results , we find @xmath398 at @xmath201 confidence .",
    "the results of this work can not rule out the continuation of the lp bulk flow to @xmath399 .",
    "a modest increase in sensitivity coupled with the observation of clusters in the opposite direction to the lp flow ( as a systematic check ) would make a definitive test possible .",
    "the sensitivity of the s - z observations described here are limited by differential atmospheric emission .",
    "it should be possible to use the distinct spectral signatures of the s - z effects to separate them from atmospheric noise .",
    "this requires simultaneous measurements along a given line of sight in at least three mm - wavelength bands .",
    "we have constructed and begun observations with an instrument capable of such measurements .",
    "this instrument should eventually have the capability of determining cluster peculiar velocities limited by the astrophysical confusion of the s - z effect .",
    "we would like to thank ken ganga for many informative discussions .",
    "the presentation has also benefited significantly from the comments of an anonymous referee .",
    "thanks to antony schinkel and the entire staff of the cso for their excellent support during the observations .",
    "the cso is operated by the california institute of technology under funding from the national science foundation , contract # ast-93 - 13929 .",
    "this work has been made possible by a grant from the david and lucile packard foundation and by a national science foundation grant # ast-95 - 03226 ."
