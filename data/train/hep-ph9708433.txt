    "recently exotic hadron states have been studied elaborately . among them , an h - dibaryon has been an object of many works@xcite as a hopeful candidate of @xmath5 state since the prediction by jaffe@xcite in the mit bag model .",
    "lots of theoretical studies have been made on the problem of the h - dibaryon , and have predicted the h - dibaryon mass below the @xmath6 threshold@xcite .",
    "the skyrme model was first applied to the h - dibaryon by balachandran _",
    "_ proposing the @xmath3 so(3 ) soliton configuration , which has the symmetric configuration in terms of the flavor su(3)@xcite .",
    "they obtained the h - dibaryon mass lighter than two @xmath7 s ( @xmath8 ) in the su(3 ) flavor symmetric limit .    experimentally , several candidate events have been reported@xcite , but any conclusive result for its existence is not obtained yet .",
    "the binding energy of two @xmath7 s in a double hypernucleus places a restriction on the h - mass .",
    "a double hypernucleus event found at kek@xcite implies that the lower limit of the h - dibaryon mass is a few tens of mev below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the possibility of the existence of h - dibaryon matter in a high - density neutron star is pointed out by tamagaki _",
    "et al._@xcite . in their argument",
    ", the compactness of the h - dibaryon radius is an important assumption on the existence of h - dibaryon matter , although the size of h - dibaryon may vary in the dense system as the nucleon swelling phenomenon in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "if so , nuclear matter may decay into h - matter at a critical density @xmath9 ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) before the phase transition into quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the properties of nuclear matter at high densities have been investigated in many ways .",
    "et al . _ studied skyrmion matter by placing su(2 ) hedgehog skyrmions on a lattice and show that the deconfinement phase transition and the chiral symmetry restoration occur above a critical density@xcite . manton and",
    "ruback obtained the similar results by a simple and mathematically sophisticated approach . instead of placing many skyrmions in the flat space @xmath12 ,",
    "skyrmion matter is approximated by one skyrmion on an @xmath0 hypersphere with radius @xmath13 .",
    "they showed that beyond a critical density the lowest energy solution is given by the  identity map \" and the baryon density distributes uniformly on the hypersphere@xcite . in this phase ,",
    "the spacially averaged value of the chiral order parameter becomes zero , which may imply the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities .",
    "this phase transition was investigated also in the case of two skyrmions on @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the result is qualitatively the same as one skyrmion case on @xmath0 , and they concluded that these behaviors are a general tendency in the skyrme model .    in this paper , we investigate the feature of h - dibaryon matter by using the so(3 ) skyrmion with baryon number 2 located on @xmath0 hypersphere .",
    "we study how the qcd phase transition occurs in this situation .",
    "we study also how the size of the h - dibaryon varies in high - density h - matter .",
    "for simplicity on the mathematical and physical insight , we deal with the chiral limit in this paper .",

    "the profile functions are obtained numerically by extremizing the energy functional @xmath31 under the boundary conditions ( [ boundcond ] ) .",
    "we show in fig.1 the profile functions of the @xmath3 so(3 ) skyrmion on @xmath0 in typical two cases using the parameters in ref.@xcite : @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 .",
    "( in refs.@xcite , the energy scale is rescaled by @xmath46 mev , and the length scale by @xmath47 fm to reduce variable dimensionless . )",
    "there are always two physically equivalent solutions : one is localized around the north pole , and another is localized around the south pole when @xmath13 is large .",
    "the two solutions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , have the same energy , and have the relation , @xmath50 at low densities , the skyrmion localizes at either pole . in fig.1(a ) , the profile functions for @xmath51 fm are shown , where the skyrmion is localized around the south pole .",
    "the behavior of the profile functions is similar to that for the skyrmion on the flat space @xmath12@xcite . on the other hand , as shown in fig.1(b ) , the profile functions spread all over the hypersphere at high densities .    fig.2 shows the energy of the so(3 ) skyrmion solution with the lowest energy as a function of the hypersphere radius @xmath13 . at large @xmath13",
    ", the energy of the skyrmion on @xmath0 approaches the one on @xmath12 .",
    "the behavior of the energy is essentially parallel with the su(2 ) skyrmion on @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the character of the lowest energy solution changes around @xmath52 fm .",
    "the minimum energy is attained at @xmath53 fm , and the minimum value is only 4 % above the bps saturation value @xmath54 ( bogomolny bound ) .",
    "it can be shown that the bps saturation@xcite is never attained for the so(3 ) skyrmion on @xmath0 unlike the su(2 ) skyrmion on @xmath0 . in the @xmath55 su(2 ) case , the bps saturation is achieved by the  identity map \" , @xmath56 with @xmath57 or @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) solution on @xmath0 becomes  identity map \" for small @xmath0 as @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , in the so(3 ) soliton solution , there are two kinds of profile functions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the @xmath3 so(3 ) solution on @xmath0 tends to approach @xmath62 as @xmath13 decreases as shown in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "moreover , there is a similarity in that the profile function has linear dependence on @xmath27 , so that we call the @xmath3 so(3 ) solution with @xmath62 as the  identity map \" in this paper .",
    "being different from the su(2 ) case , the  identity map \" does not satisfy the euler - lagrange equations so that it is slightly above the lowest energy curve at high densities .    at the low density phase",
    ", the baryon density is localized around either the north or the south pole , while at the high density phase the so(3 ) skyrmion spreads over the hypersphere , and loses its identity as a soliton .",
    "this may correspond to a phase transition from the confinement phase to the deconfinement phase . in fig.3",
    ", we show the baryon number densities @xmath63 of the solutions of several hypersphere radii around this phase transition .",
    "we can clearly see the localized - delocalized transition .",
    "the phase transition occurs so smoothly that it is difficult to find the critical density strictly .",
    "if we put the critical radius @xmath64 to be 0.8@xmath651.0 fm , the corresponding critical density @xmath66 is 0.1@xmath650.2 baryons/@xmath67 , which is the same order of magnitude as the equilibrium nuclear matter density @xmath68 .",
    "this is rather smaller value than the expected critical density which is the order of several times @xmath68 .",
    "too low critical density problem appears also in @xmath55 hedgehog skyrmion matter@xcite . the critical density @xmath69 is 0.07 @xmath65 0.18 @xmath11 in these models .",
    "one of the reason is probably the lack of the kinetic energy as stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to be successful in modeling the high density phase transition in qcd qualitatively by such simple models .",
    "the order parameter @xmath70 , which is a measure of the chiral symmetry breaking , is introduced by the spacial average@xcite , @xmath71 as shown in fig.4 , the order parameter @xmath70 becomes smaller at high densities , which is considered to be the sign of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the non - zero value of the order parameter may be due to the limitation of the non - linear sigma model .    the skyrmion root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "radius is given by @xmath72 and shown in fig.5 .",
    "the contributions from the upper half ( @xmath73 ) and the lower half ( @xmath74 ) of the hypersphere are also shown . at low densities , @xmath75 is almost determined by the contribution from the half of the hypersphere where the skyrmion localizes , while the both contributions are almost the same at high densities . thus the deconfinement phase transition is read also in fig.5 . at low densities , the skyrmion size coincides with the size of the skyrmion on @xmath12 . in the localized phase ( @xmath76 fm )",
    ", the size @xmath75 of the so(3 ) skyrmion becomes larger corresponding to the spread of its profile functions for small @xmath13 or at high densities .",
    "this enlargement implies the swelling of the h - dibaryon in high density h - dibaryon matter . in the deconfinement phase , where the skyrmion loses its identity as the soliton",
    ", @xmath75 decreases linearly with the hypersphere radius @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we compare the so(3 ) soliton solution with the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) one , which is also a candidate of the ground state of the @xmath3 skyrmion on a small hypersphere @xmath0 in the two - flavor case @xcite .",
    "we show in fig.6 the total energy as a function of the hypersphere radius @xmath13 for the so(3 ) and the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) soliton solutions in the @xmath3 sector on @xmath0 .",
    "the energy difference is found to be quite small between the so(3 ) and the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) solutions for the high density region as @xmath77 fm .",
    "for instance , one finds @xmath78 for @xmath79 fm .",
    "one also finds @xmath80 and @xmath81 . from the detailed analyses , the so(3 ) solution is the true ground state for @xmath82 fm ( dilute case ) and @xmath2 fm ( dense case ) , while the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) solution is more stable for the intermediate density regions as @xmath83 fm .",
    "thus , the so(3 ) soliton solution is the true ground state for the small hypersphere with @xmath84 fm in the @xmath4 chiral limit in the mathematical sense . in the real world , however , the large symmetry breaking in the strangeness sector should enhance @xmath85 largely , and therefore the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) skyrmion may become more stable .",
    "we next consider the chiral order parameter @xmath70 in eq.([chiralorderparam ] ) .",
    "since the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) solution takes the form as @xmath86 with @xmath87 @xcite independent of @xmath13 , @xmath88 .",
    "it is to be noted that the so(2)@xmath1so(2 ) solution on @xmath0 provide the  chiral symmetric phase \" only in the two - flavor sector , and does not lead to the @xmath4 chiral symmetric phase .    in summary , the so(3 ) skyrmion solution with @xmath3 has been investigated on a hypersphere @xmath0 to study high density h - dibaryon matter . in this system , the deconfinement transition and the chiral symmetry restoration have been found at high densities similarly to @xmath55 su(2 ) skyrmion matter . as a remarkable fact , the h - dibaryon in h - matter swells at high densities .",
    "the swelling phenomenon is considered to reflect the attractive nature of the interaction between h - dibaryons@xcite .",
    "such a possibility of the swelling of the h - dibaryon would be important for the study of h - matter in dense neutron stars , because the compactness of the h - dibaryon is a basic assumption for the existence of h - matter .",
    "for the realistic treatment of h - dibaryon , we need to take account of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "this will be done in the future work .",
