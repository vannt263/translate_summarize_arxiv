    "the brownian bridge ( bb ) is a one - dimensional brownian motion @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which is conditioned to return to the starting point @xcite . without loss of generality",
    "one can postulate that the bb starts and returns to the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath10 .",
    "bbs admit numerous interpretations .",
    "for instance , a bb can be regarded as a stationary @xmath11-dimensional edwards - wilkinson interface @xcite in a box with periodic boundary conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bbs naturally arise in the analysis of convex hulls of planar brownian motions @xcite and of dephasing due to electron - electron interactions in quasi-@xmath12 wires @xcite , they have been used to model a random potential in studies of diffusion in presence of a strong periodic disorder @xcite and are also relevant for diffusion in disordered non - periodic potentials as they are related to the statistics of transients .",
    "bbs appear in mathematical statistics , e.g. , in kolmogorov - smirnov tests of the difference between the empirical distributions calculated from a sample and the true distributions governing the sample process @xcite ( see also @xcite for the applications in mathematical finance ) .",
    "bbs are often used in computer science , e.g. , in the analysis of the maximal size reached by a dynamic data structure over a long period of time @xcite . in ecology , bbs have been used for an analysis of animal home ranges and migration routes , as well as for estimating the influence of resource selection on movement @xcite .",
    "extremal value statistics of the bbs , e.g. , statistics of a maximum , a minimum , or a range on the entire time interval @xmath3 $ ] were studied beginning with classical papers @xcite , and were subsequently generalized for bessel process ( the radius of a @xmath13-dimensional brownian motion ) with a bridge constraint @xcite , and also for some conditioned extremal values of bbs @xcite .",
    "the statistics of longest excursions and various non - self - averaging characteristics of bbs have been studied e.g. in refs .",
    "using a real - space renormalisation group technique , a wealth of results on the extreme value statistics of bbs , reflected brownian bridges , brownian meanders and excursions , as well as more general processes like bessel bridges , have been presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the joint statistics and temporal correlations between the partial maximum @xmath14 and the global maximum @xmath15 achieved by the bb on the subinterval @xmath2 $ ] and on the entire interval @xmath3 $ ] , see fig .",
    "we recently studied similar problems for the unconstrained brownian motion @xcite , and below we compare the outcomes for the bb and the standard brownian motion ( bm ) starting at the origin . due to the ubiquitousness of the bbs ,",
    "our results admit numerous reformulations .",
    "for instance , the analogy with the edwards - wilkinson interface asserts that our problem is tantamount to studying the correlations of the maximal height of the interface on the entire interval and the maximal height in a window near one of the fixed boundaries .    in the next section",
    "we determine three probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) : the joint pdf of both maxima , @xmath4 ; the pdf of the partial maximum , @xmath5 ; and the pdf of the gap between the maxima , @xmath6 with @xmath16 . using these distributions ,",
    "we derive exact expressions for the moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 with arbitrary @xmath19 .",
