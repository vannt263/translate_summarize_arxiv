    "the study of axially symmetric solutions of the einstein and einstein - maxwell field equations corresponding to disklike configurations of matter , apart from its purely mathematical interest , has a clear astrophysical relevance .",
    "now , although normally it is considered that disks with electric fields do not have clear astrophysical importance , there exists the posibility that some galaxies be positively charged @xcite , so the study of charged disks may be of interest not only in the context of exact solutions . on the other hand , the observational data supporting the existence of black holes at the nucleus of some galaxies",
    "is today so abundant , with the strongest dynamical evidence coming from the center of the milky way , that there is no doubt about the relevance of the study of binary systems composed by a thin disk surrounding a central black hole ( see @xcite for recent reviews on the observational evidence ) .",
    "now , as was shown by lemos and letelier @xcite , it is clear that the obtaining of exact solutions that properly describe thin disklike sources with an inner edge has a clear relevance in the study of binary systems that involve a central black hole . indeed ,",
    "as was pointed in @xcite , the main properties of these annular disks strongly depend on their specific density profiles .",
    "therefore , it is worth to have other solutions , in addition to those obtained previously , in such a way that a thoroughly study of such systems can be made .",
    "also , the obtaining of static solutions can be considered as the first step in the obtaining of the more realistic stationary solutions , which can be obtained from the previous ones by means of well known methods of solutions generation .    in agreement with the above considerations , in this paper we present an infinite family of new exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations for static axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "these solutions describe a family of relativistic charged thin disks with an inner edge , the charged version of the family of relativistic thin dust disks with an inner edge recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the solutions were obtained by applying the ernst method of complex potentials @xcite , which generates a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations starting from a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : einm ] , we present the formalism to describe thin disks . then , in section [ sec : discs ] , we present a family of charged thin disks with an inner edge , while in section [ sec : beha ] we analize the behavior of the solutions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we conclude by summarizing our main results .",
    "the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations , in geometrized units such that @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath1 with the electromagnetic energy - mementum tensor given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath4 is the electromagnetic four potential .",
    "now , for a static axially symmetric spacetime the line element can be written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 as @xcite @xmath6 , \\label{eq : met } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the metric functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on @xmath9 and @xmath10 only .",
    "we take the electromagnetic potential as @xmath11 where it is assumed that the electric potential @xmath12 also depends on @xmath9 and @xmath10 only .",
    "the solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations corresponding to a disklike source are even functions of the @xmath10 coordinate .",
    "therefore , they are everywhere continuous functions but with their first @xmath10-derivatives discontinuous at the disk surface . accordingly , in order to obtain the energy - momentun tensor and the current density of the source , we will express the jump across the disk of the first @xmath10-derivatives of the metric tensor as @xmath13 = 2 { g_{ab , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\ ] ] and the jump across the disk of the electromagnetic field tensor as @xmath14 = [ a_{a , z } ] = 2 { a_{a , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\ ] ] where the reflection symmetry of the functions with respect to @xmath15 has been used .",
    "then , by using the distributional approach @xcite or the junction conditions on the extrinsic curvature of thin shells @xcite , the einstein - maxwell equations yield an energy - momentum tensor as @xmath16 + q^{ab } \\delta(z ) , \\label{eq : emtot}\\ ] ] and a current density as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the heaveside and dirac distributions with support on @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath20 are the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensors as defined by ( [ eq : emtensor ] ) for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 regions , respectively , whereas that @xmath23 gives the part of the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the disk source , and @xmath24\\ ] ] is the contribution of the disk source to the current density .",
    "now , the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk , @xmath25 , and the surface current density , @xmath26 , can be obtained through the relations @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the physical measurement of length in the direction normal to the disk .    for the metric ( [ eq : met ] ) , the only non - zero component of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 where all the quantities are evaluated at @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk and the surface current density of the disk can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the velocity vector of the matter distribution .",
    "in this section we consider a family of static axially symmetric solutions of the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations given , for @xmath35 , by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "the functions are all expresed in terms of the oblate spheroidal coordinates , connected with the cylindrical coordinates via the transformation formulas @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this solution was obtained , by means of the ernst method of complex potentials @xcite , from the solutions describing a family of relativistic static thin dust disks with an inner edge recently presented in @xcite .    in the above expressions , the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "can be easily obtained by means of the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "so , the functions @xmath43 are polynomial functions with highest degree @xmath45 , the first two of them being @xmath46 while the @xmath44 are polynomial functions off highest degree @xmath47 , of which the first two are @xmath48 all of them easily obtained as described in @xcite .",
    "now , the expressions for the surface energy density @xmath49 and the surface charge density @xmath50 of the disks can be written as @xmath51 where all of the quantities are evaluated at @xmath32 . accordingly , by using the expressions ( [ eq : phin ] ) - ( [ eq : lamn ] ) , we obtain for the energy density and the charge density the expressions @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the surface energy density of the static thin dust disks , without charge , as presented in @xcite .    in the above expression ,",
    "the @xmath54 are positive definite polynomials of degree @xmath55 , with @xmath56 for odd @xmath57 and @xmath58 for even @xmath57 , of which we only will write below the first three , @xmath59 and the @xmath60 are positive definite polynomials of degree @xmath61 , with @xmath62 for odd @xmath57 and @xmath58 for even @xmath57 , being @xmath63 the first three of them .",
    "from the expressions in the previous section we can see that , by taking @xmath64 , the energy density of the disks will be everywhere positive , @xmath65 so that , as the azimuthal pressure is zero , we have an infinite family of dust disks that are in fully agreement with all the energy conditions . also is easy to see that , for any value of @xmath57 , @xmath66 that is , the energy density of the disks is zero at their inner edge and vanishes at infinite .",
    "furthermore , the surface mass density of the disks reduces to their energy density , @xmath67 so that its behavior is the same as of the energy density . finally , by using equation ( [ eq : enern ] ) and ( [ eq : charn ] ) we can write @xmath68 so that the charge density of the disks is equal , except by a constant , to their energy density . accordingly , the electric and gravitational forces are in exact balance , as in the configurations of ` electrically counterpoised dust ' .",
    "@xmath69    now , in order to show the behavior of the energy densities , we plot the dimensionless surface energy densities @xmath70 as functions of the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath71 .",
    "so , in figure [ fig : energy ] , we plot @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 for the first three disks of the family , with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for different values of the parameter @xmath77 . then",
    ", for each value of @xmath57 , we take @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the first curve on left corresponds to @xmath78 , while the last curve on right corresponds to @xmath81 . the curves with greatest maximum corresponds to @xmath82 , whereas the curves with least maximum corresponds to @xmath83 , the disks without charge .",
    "as we can see , in all the cases the surface energy density is positive everywhere , having a maximum near the inner edge of the disks , and then rapidly decreasing as @xmath73 increases .",
    "we can also see that , for a fixed value of @xmath57 , as the value of @xmath84 increases , the value of the maximum diminishes and moves towards increasing values of @xmath73 .",
    "also , as there is a direct relationship between @xmath85 and the electric field , the maximum of the curves increases as the electric field increases .",
    "the same behavior is observed for a fixed value of @xmath84 and increasing values of @xmath57 .",
    "we presented an infinite family of new exact solutions of the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations for static and axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the solutions describe an infinite family of charged thin dust disks with a central inner edge , the charged version of the family of relativistic thin dust disks with an inner edge recently presented in @xcite .",
    "now , although the strange behavior of the newtonian potentials may suggest that the disks do not correspond to reasonable astrophysical sources , their energy densities are everywhere positive and well behaved , in such a way that their energy - momentum tensor are in fully agreement with all the energy conditions .    on the other hand , as all the metric functions of the solutions were explicitly computed , these are the first fully integrated exact solutions for such kind of thin disk sources .",
    "moreover , the method used here to obtain these explicit solutions may serve as a guideline to find more physical solutions in future works . now , besides their importance as a new family of exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell vacuum equations , the main importance of this family of solutions is that they can be easily superposed with the schwarzschild solution in order to describe binary systems composed by a thin disk surrounding a charged central black hole , as was be done in @xcite with the first member of the family of relativistic thin dust disks presented in @xcite ."
