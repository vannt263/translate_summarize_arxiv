    "the detection of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows still constitutes a challenge to observational astronomy .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that three years after the discovery of grb afterglows in the optical ( van paradijs _",
    "1997 ) less than 20 such optical transients have been detected and followed up ( see greiner 2000 for continuous updates ) . among the afterglows recorded to date the emission from grb 000418 represents the second case for which the afterglow was initially identified in a gamma - ray burst error box by observations in the near - infrared (",
    "the first case is grb 990705 ; masetti _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .",
    "grb 000418 was observed on april 18.41 ut by the third interplanetary network ( ipn ) , with ulysses ( hurley _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) and the near - earth asteroid rendezvous mission ( near , xgrs detector , goldsten _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) as its distant points , and ggs - wind konus ( aptekar _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) close to earth .",
    "the burst had a duration of @xmath230 seconds , and a fluence in the 25100 kev range of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 ( hurley , cline , & mazets 2000 ) .",
    "these properties characterize the event as a long , relatively bright grb ( cf .",
    "fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "rapid follow - up and second epoch near - infrared ( nir ) observations of the central part of the 35 arcmin@xmath5 sized grb error box led to the detection of a nir source ( klose _ et al .",

    "the fading of the afterglow is clearly illustrated in fig . 1 which reports @xmath0-band images taken at tng on april 20 and june 2 , 2000",

    "et al . _ 2000 ; castro - tirado _ et al . _ 2000 ) . triggered by the nir detection of the afterglow of grb 000418 ,",
    "many observatories world - wide directed their attention to this burst . here",
    "we report on a subset of these activities , with emphasis on the @xmath0-band light curve . _",
    "the ipn error box of grb 000418 became known two days after the burst .",
    "the observations leading to the discovery of the grb afterglow were performed on 2000 april 20 and april 22 with the 3.5-m telescope on calar alto , spain , equipped with the near - infrared camera _",
    "omega cass ( lenzen _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) which was operated in the polarimetric mode .",
    "the central part of the elongated grb error box was imaged with the 3.5-m telescope in the course of a target of opportunity project . in the polarimetric wide - field mode",
    "the _ omega cass camera has a @xmath11 field of view and an image scale of 0.3@xmath12/pixel .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the @xmath13-band image is @xmath218.5 for unpolarized objects after adding all frames taken at different position angles of the wire - grid polarizer . _ _    further near - infrared observations were performed at the calar alto 1.23-m telescope using the nir camera _ magic , with the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) equipped with the ukirt fast - track imager and using the calar alto 3.5-m telescope equipped with the _ omega prime near - infrared camera ( table 1 ) .",
    "optical follow - up observations were performed at the italian _ telescopio nazionale galileo _ ( tng ) , la palma , spain , at the u.s . naval observatory flagstaff station ( nofs ) , at the 1.52-m  g.d .",
    "cassini \" telescope of the university of bologna in loiano , italy , and on calar alto using the 3.5-m telescope with the multi - purpose instrument _ mosca .",
    "tng is equipped with the oig camera , which contains two eev ccds .",
    "the loiano telescope employs the bfosc instrument , equipped with an eev ccd .",
    "the nofs observations were performed with either the 1.3-m automated telescope , equipped with a site ccd , or the 1.0-m telescope , equipped with a tektronix ccd . _ _ _    the @xmath13-band measurements performed on april 20.90 ut were reduced in a standard fashion .",
    "the sky contribution was obtained from the median of the dithered images and , in combination with a proper dark frame , used to derive the flat field .",
    "the images were sky - subtracted , flat - fielded , bad - pixel corrected , and finally mosaicked .",
    "this procedure was performed for each orientation of the polarimetric analyzer .",
    "the final image is the sum of the frames obtained for each orientation of the polarizer .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to derive the linear polarization from these frames .",
    "the calar alto 3.5-m data of april 22 were obtained during variable sky and required another method to estimate the flat field .",
    "the considerable temporal variation of the sky background allowed the derivation of both the flat field and bias by pixelwise linear regression , similar to the scheme proposed by fixsen , moseley , & arendt ( 2000 ) .",
    "otherwise , the image processing was the same .",
    "we determined the @xmath13-band magnitude of the afterglow by means of optical photometry of secondary standard stars in the field around the burster ( henden 2000 ) and by means of the usno - sa2.0 catalog ( monet _ et al .",
    "the basic assumption in our procedure is that the selected field stars are main - sequence stars and that their optical colors are representative for their spectral type .",
    "we corrected our @xmath13-band data for differences in the @xmath14 magnitudes using the relation @xmath15 ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 color of the afterglow was calculated based on the @xmath17 color measured on april 20.9 ut ( table 1 ) and assuming a @xmath18 optical - nir spectrum ( see below ) ; this gives @xmath190.2 mag .",
    "finally , we used the wide - field @xmath13-band image obtained at calar alto on may 15 to calibrate the narrow - field ukirt @xmath20-band image from may 4 .",
    "although the photometry of our nir data is not as accurate as our @xmath0-band photometry this does not affect the basic content of the following discussion (  3 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-band light curve is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    because grb 000418 was at high galactic latitude , we assume that the faint photometric reference stars exhibit the same galactic extinction as the grb afterglow .",
    "the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) extinction maps predict @xmath21 through the galaxy along galactic coordinates @xmath22 = 2651 , 805 . assuming a ratio of visual to selective extinction of 3.1 , this gives @xmath230.12 mag .",
    "the dust distribution model of chi & wolfendale ( 1991 ) predicts a larger visual extinction of @xmath230.19 mag , while the compilation of hakkila _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) predicts a very small value of @xmath230.02 mag .",
    "we take the value derived from schlegel _ et al .",
    "_ , which is close to the mean of the latter two estimates .",
    "then , according to rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , this corresponds to @xmath24 mag and @xmath25=0.01 mag .    for the @xmath0-band optical frames ,",
    "psf - fitting was performed using daophot - ii as implemented in iraf .",
    "the deep frames provided a means to find isolated , well - sampled stars in a field highly contaminated by galaxies .",
    "these stars were used to calculate mean point spread functions , and the instrumental magnitudes of the optical transient and several comparison stars were extracted .",
    "the comparison star standard @xmath0-band magnitudes were obtained from the field photometry file of henden ( 2000 ) , and the afterglow magnitude determined differentially with respect to the ensemble mean .",
    "grb 000418 is a `` ipn - only '' burst , and its afterglow was not observed in the x - ray band .",
    "moreover , radio observations of grb 000418 were not performed before april 29 ( frail 2000 ) .",
    "the lack of these data limits the diagnostic power of afterglow observations in this case , but the optical decay still yields a significant parameter ( the slope of the decay law ) , and future changes in slope might yet provide evidence for beaming or contamination by light from an underlying supernova .",
    "therefore , we concentrate here on the interpretation of the optical / nir afterglow of this burst .",
    "we follow the `` standard procedure '' ( e.g. , wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; galama _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; frail , waxman , & kulkarni 2000 ) for interpreting afterglows within the context of the so - called fireball model . in this widely accepted model for grb afterglows , the spectral signature is due predominantly to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated in the strong shock wave that propagates into the burst environment ( and also a reverse shock propagating into the burst ejecta , in close analogy to the situation in supernova remnants , with the exception that grbs produce highly relativistic shocks ) .",
    "the emerging spectrum is a combination of emission from internal shocks ( energy dissipation within the ejecta ) and external shocks driven into a medium that could be roughly uniform ( ism - like ) or have strong radial profiles , as would be the case if the external medium is wind material from a massive star prior to becoming a collapsar",
    ". the basic properties of these relativistic shock models are reviewed by piran ( 1999 ) and mszros ( 2000 ) . in the simplest model ( an impulsive blast wave , a uniform circumburster medium , and spherical symmetry ) , the evolution of the afterglow flux density evolves according to a power - law in time , i.e.",
    ", @xmath26 once the synchrotron peak has moved through the bandpass .",
    "the time - dependent apparent magnitude in a given photometric band is then described by @xmath27 @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is measured from the time of the occurrence of the burst ( see vrba _",
    "2000 for a discussion of the zero point of @xmath29 ) .",
    "possible deviations from a power - law decay of the afterglow flux can be caused by a variety of reasons ( see rhoads & fruchter 2000 for a recent discussion ) : different afterglow physics and model assumptions about the environment ( cf .",
    "panaitescu , mszros , & rees 1998 ) , a jet geometry ( cf .",
    "sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) , supernova light which adds to the afterglow flux ( cf .",
    "1999 ) , light echoes due to dust clouds around the burst ( e.g. , esin & blandford 2000 ) or an emerging host galaxy which becomes detectable when the afterglow is faint enough ( cf .",
    "zharikov , sokolov , & baryshev 1998 ) .",
    "most afterglows are very faint in the optical , even at early times , and therefore are usually observed at the detection limit of optical telescopes .",
    "an observational search for deviations from the prediction of the simplest fireball model is therefore difficult in most cases .",
    "grb 000418 is no exception to this .    if we consider only the first five data points of the afterglow light curve ( fig .",
    "2 ) , then the best - fit temporal power - law slope is @xmath30 ( @xmath31/dof=0.31 ) , in agreement with mirabal",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 2000a , b ) .",
    "however , starting in may ( after 10 days since the grb trigger ) the @xmath0-band data indicate a significant flattening with respect to the predicted power - law decay of the afterglow flux with @xmath32=0.86 .",
    "light from an underlying host galaxy can explain this discrepancy .",
    "the best fit now is @xmath32=1.22 and @xmath33 ( @xmath31/dof=2.18 ) .",
    "( in this fit we have omitted the single calar alto @xmath0-band data point from june 2 .",
    "if we include it we get @xmath32=1.29 , @xmath34 . )    at the time of the @xmath13-band observation ( april 20.9 ut ) the afterglow was very red with @xmath35 mag ( table 1 ) .",
    "a similar red color was observed for grb 980329 ( palazzi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and grb 990705 ( masetti _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . if we take reddening by galactic dust into account (  2 ) , then , on april 20.9 ut , the observed spectral slope across the @xmath36-band is @xmath37 , where the uncertainty is dominated by the error of the @xmath13-band magnitude .",
    "the slow power - law decay of the afterglow , @xmath38 , favors spherically symmetric evolution ( table 2 ) .",
    "following the analysis of sari , piran , & narayan ( 1998 ) for a shock expanding into a uniform medium , the predicted value for the spectral slope @xmath39 across the @xmath36 passband is @xmath40 or @xmath41 , respectively , depending on whether or not the bulk of the radiating electrons is in the fast cooling regime , i.e. whether or not the characteristic cooling time is shorter than the age of the shock . since our observations started several hours after the grb we expect that at this time the bulk of the electrons was already in the slow cooling regime .",
    "the slope @xmath42 of the power - law distribution of electron lorentz factors , @xmath43 , is then @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that the observed spectral index @xmath39 significantly exceeds the predicted value could plausibly be a consequence of extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "extinction in the host galaxy may change the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the afterglow in the optical / nir bands such that the sed in the optical / nir range can no longer be approximated by a single power - law .",
    "this renders the color estimate redshift - dependent . assuming that the local extinction in the grb environment is dominated by dust",
    ", we corrected the observed optical / nir spectral slope of the afterglow by adopting a local optical extinction curve @xmath45 ) in the grb environment which is similar to that for the galactic interstellar dust ( sdius , bobinas , & raudelinas 1996 ) .",
    "however , we let the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath46 , a free parameter , in order to describe approximately the various extinction curves found in star - forming regions in our galaxy ( e.g. , vrba , coyne , & tapia 1993 ) and in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , calzetti 1997 ) . for a redshift of @xmath47 ( bloom _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) and a galactic visual extinction in the direction of the optical transient of @xmath48 = 0.12 mag (  2 ) we find that a visual extinction in the host galaxy of @xmath49/3.17 mag is required in order to change the spectral index from @xmath50 to the observed one , assuming no contribution from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed optical / nir color can in principle be forced to agree with the observed power - law decline slope _",
    "if _ , on april 20.9 ut , the observations were carried out at a time when the effects of jet formation were not manifest , i.e. the light curve is well represented by the adiabatic , spherical fireball solution ( e.g. , wijers _",
    "_ 1997 ; sari _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and the afterglow was significantly reddened due to dust extinction in the host galaxy . while this argument supports the notion that the grb was associated with a massive star embedded in a star - forming region ( e.g. , paczyski 1998 ; fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ) , the optical / nir observations alone can not constrain the position of the intervening dust in the grb host galaxy .",
    "we note , however , that our value for @xmath51 is comparable to those deduced from observations of the optical afterglows of grb 980703 ( castro - tirado _ et al . _ 1999b ; vreeswijk _ et al . _",
    "1999a ) , grb 971214 ( dal fiume _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ; halpern _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; ramaprakash _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and grb 980329 ( palazzi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    combining the may 3.3 ut @xmath0-band measurement with",
    "the may 4.4 ut @xmath20-band data gives a color of the afterglow of @xmath520.4 mag . within our measurement errors",
    "this is not in conflict with our april 20.9 data , assuming that the color is now affected by the color of the underlying host galaxy . on may 8.9",
    "ut ( day 20.5 ) we measure @xmath53=0.64 which also indicates that the optical spectrum is less steep at later times .",
    "the @xmath36 color value for the afterglow , together with the assumption of a flat spectrum for the host , suggests that on may 8.9 the main contribution to the measured @xmath54 magnitude is due to the host galaxy , as we derive @xmath55 ( and @xmath56 ) in this hypothesis .",
    "our imaging , however , does not reveal the grb host galaxy as an extended structure .",
    "the source remaines point - like .",
    "we have compared the tng image from april 20 with the tng image obtained on may 23 in order to get an information about the displacement @xmath57 of the grb afterglow from the luminosity center of the host galaxy . in the tng image from april 20 the point spread function ( psf ) of the source is mainly determined by the grb afterglow , whereas in the tng image from may 23 it is mainly determined by the host galaxy .",
    "this allowed us to check if there is evidence for a shift of the center of the psf with respect to a near - by reference star .",
    "we found no evidence for such a shift and conclude @xmath5801 .    initially , the observed temporal power - law decay of the afterglow of grb 000418 was somewhat similar to that observed in the early light curve of grb 990510 ( table 2 ) , the time scale however was notably different .",
    "the afterglow of grb 990510 was slow for only about the first 24 hours , afterwards steepening to @xmath59 .",
    "by contrast , the afterglow of grb 000418 displayed this slow decay mode for the first 10 days ( see vrba _ et al . _",
    "2000 for a compilation of other late - time temporal power - law slopes ) . with the underlying host galaxy becoming apparent in the afterglow flux the deduced temporal slope @xmath38 brings this burst now close to grbs 970228 , 970508 ( garcia _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and 971214 ( kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; ramaprakash _ et al .",
    "based on the @xmath0-band data alone the parameters characterizing a grb afterglow are not strongly constrained . in general , the two observational parameters easiest to determine in the optical with reasonable accuracy are the temporal power - law decay slope , @xmath32 , and the redshift of the grb host , if present .",
    "the spectral slope , @xmath39 , is affected by extinction and thus much less accurately known , and model - dependent . on the other hand",
    ", even the deduced parameter @xmath32 can be misleading if the observed temporal evolution of the afterglow flux is affected by an underlying host galaxy which becomes visible only at later times ( cf .",
    "castro - tirado & gorosabel 1999 ) .",
    "the database available to us is not sufficient to distinguish between the various non - standard afterglow models , like a blast into a uniform medium vs. a shock expanding into a pre - existing stellar wind with a circumburster density profile @xmath60 , or the possible effects from anisotropic outflows ( mszros , & rees , & wijers 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) . in particular , the grb afterglow decline slope @xmath32 is not very steep , which hampers an unambiguous detection of a supernova component in the afterglow ( cf .",
    "et al . _ 1999 ) .",
    "the observational evidence which we found for a reddening of the afterglow in the grb host galaxy supports however the picture that the grb was associated with a dusty star forming region .",
    "the redshift of grb 000418 has been estimated from a line doublet attributed to [ oii ] emitted by the host galaxy ( bloom _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . with this preliminary identification",
    "the redshift is @xmath61= 1.118 , which is close to the mean of the current redshift database . assuming spherical emission , the energy release in gamma - rays of grb 000418 was thus about @xmath62 erg ( bloom _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) and the total observed fluence in the @xmath0-band between day 2.5 and day 50 is about 0.03% of the energy in the gamma - ray regime .",
    "the energy release in gamma - rays is about two orders of magnitude less luminous than the current record for grb 990123 ( andersen _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; kulkarni _ et al .",
    "it places this burst near the median of the dozen presently determined energy releases ( see klose 2000 for a recent review ) .",
    "if the brightest bursts are those with the smallest collimation angles ( in order to reduce the energy requirements ) grb 000418 might not be strongly beamed .",
    "indeed , based on our data , covering day 2 to day 50 after the burst , we do not find evidence for a noticeable break in the light curve , which would be the telltale signature of an emerging view of the jet s edge .",
    "moreover , within the context of the fireball model ( e.g. , wijers _",
    "_ 1997 ; sari _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) we can explain the optical / nir data with the simple spherical solution .",
    "since the observations of this afterglow do not cover the first two days , we are unable to state with certainty that we have not missed any break in the early light curve .",
    "however , if that had been the case the early power - law decay would have been even slower , i.e. @xmath63 , which would make it close to that of grb 970508 ( e.g. , castro - tirado _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and perhaps place the spectrum in the @xmath64 regime with @xmath65 ( sari _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "grb 000418 is only the @xmath210th burst for which a well observed afterglow lightcurve has been established .",

    "<S> we report near - infrared and optical follow - up observations of the afterglow of the gamma - ray burst 000418 starting 2.5 days after the occurrence of the burst and extending over nearly seven weeks . </S>",
    "<S> grb 000418 represents the second case for which the afterglow was initially identified by observations in the near - infrared . during the first 10 days its @xmath0-band afterglow was well characterized by a single power - law decay with a slope of 0.86 </S>",
    "<S> however , at later times the temporal evolution of the afterglow flattens with respect to a simple power - law decay . attributing this to an underlying host galaxy we find its magnitude to be @xmath0=23.9 and an intrinsic afterglow decay slope of 1.22 . </S>",
    "<S> the afterglow was very red with @xmath14 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the observations can be explained by an adiabatic , spherical fireball solution and a heavy reddening due to dust extinction in the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the picture that ( long ) bursts are associated with events in star - forming regions . </S>"
