    "heavy - fermion systems @xcite are characterized by a hierarchy of distinctive energy scales @xcite .",
    "the kondo scale , @xmath1 with bandwidth @xmath2 and superexchange @xmath3 , marks the screening of local magnetic moments .",
    "this screening is a many - body effect which entangles the spins of the conduction electrons and local moments @xcite . below the coherence temperature , which is believed to track the kondo scale @xcite , the paramagnetic ( pm ) heavy - fermion liquid",
    "@xcite emerges and corresponds to a coherent , bloch like , superposition of the screening clouds of the individual magnetic moments . even in the kondo limit ,",
    "where charge fluctuations of the impurity spins are completely suppressed , this paramagnetic state is characterized by a large fermi surface with luttinger volume including both the magnetic moments and conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "the coherence temperature of this metallic state is small or , equivalently , the effective mass large .",
    "+ kondo screening competes with the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction , which indirectly couples the local moments via the magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "the rkky energy scale is set by @xmath4 where @xmath5 corresponds to the spin susceptibility of the conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "+ the competition between kondo screening - favoring paramagnetic ground states - and the rkky interaction - favoring magnetically ordered states - is at the heart of quantum phase transitions @xcite , the detailed understanding of which is still under debate ( for recent reviews see ref . ) . + here , two radically different scenarios have been put forward to describe this quantum phase transition . in the _ standard _ hertz - millis picture @xcite ,",
    "the quasi - particles of the heavy - fermion liquid remain intact across the transition and undergo a spin - density wave transition . in particular , neutron scattering experiments of the heavy - fermion system @xmath6",
    "show that fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order parameter are responsible for the magnetic phase transition and that the transition is well understood in terms of the hertz - millis approach @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , since many experimental observations such as the almost wave vector independent spin susceptibility in @xmath7 @xcite , or the jump in the low - temperature hall coefficient in @xmath8 @xcite are not accounted for by this theory alternative scenarios have been put forward @xcite . in those scenarios ,",
    "the quantum critical point is linked to the very breakdown of the quasi - particle of the heavy - fermion state @xcite , and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface across the transition is expected @xcite .",
    "+ recent experiments on @xmath9 @xcite or @xmath10 @xcite show that a change in fermi surface ( fs ) topology must not necessarily occur only at the magnetic order - disorder quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "in fact , even in ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 it has since been shown that the fermi surface reconstruction can be shifted to either side of the qcp via application of positive or negative chemical pressure @xcite .    in this paper , we address the above questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the kondo lattice model ( klm ) . in its simplest form",
    "the klm describes an array of localized magnetic moments of spin @xmath12 , arising from atomic @xmath13-orbitals , that are coupled antiferromagnetically ( af ) via the exchange interaction @xmath3 to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons .",

    "the chemical potential is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the definition of the klm excludes charge fluctuations on the @xmath13-orbitals and as such a strict constraint of one electron per localized @xmath13-orbital has to be included . for an extensive review of this model we refer the reader to ref . .",
    "+ particle - hole symmetry at half - filling is given if hopping is restricted to nearest neighbors on the square lattice and the chemical potential is set to zero .",
    "we introduce a next - nearest neighbor hopping with matrix element @xmath26 to give a modified dispersion @xmath27 -2 t ' \\left [ \\cos(k_{x}+k_{y } ) + \\cos(k_{x}-k_{y})\\right]$ ] .",
    "as we will see , the suppression of particle - hole symmetry due to a finite value of @xmath26 leads to dramatic changes in the scaling of the quasi - particle gap at low values of @xmath14 and at half - band filling .",
    "we have considered the value @xmath28 .",
    "this choice guarantees that the spin susceptibility of the host metallic state at small dopings away from half - filling is peaked at wave vector @xmath29 .",
    "thus , antiferromagnetic order as opposed to an incommensurate spin state is favored .",
    "+ to solve the model we have used the dca @xcite approach which retains _ temporal _ fluctuations and hence accounts for the kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size .",
    "the approach relies on the coarse - graining of momentum space , and momentum conservation holds only between the @xmath18-space patches . by gradually defining smaller sized patches the dca allows to restore the @xmath18-dependency of the self - energy .",

    "scale a clear hybridization gap is apparent in the single particle spectral function and we use this criterion to estimate the coherence temperature . since the computational time required by the qmc cluster solver @xcite increases proportional to @xmath63 , this limits us in the resolution of energy scales to values of @xmath64 .",
    "it is important to note that for small dopings away from half - band filling and for the considered cluster sizes , the negative sign problem is not severe and hence is not the limiting factor .",

    "due to the very small cluster sizes considered in the dca it is clear that we will not capture the physics of this transition .",

    "[ eqn : eqn9 ] . both a variational quantum monte carlo calculation @xcite as well as a gutzwiller approximation @xcite show a rich phase diagram which bears some similarities but also important differences with the present dca calculation . at small doping away from half - filling ,",

    "it is equally important to note that in both the variational and dca approaches no kondo breakdown is apparent .",
    "in particular the variational parameter @xmath190 which encodes hybridization between the @xmath13- and @xmath38-electrons never vanishes @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath100 cdmft calculations of the three - dimensional periodic anderson model on a two site cluster and finite sized baths @xcite have put forward the idea that the magnetic order - disorder transition is driven by an orbital selective mott transition or in other words a kondo breakdown @xcite .",
    "in particular even in the presence of spin symmetry broken baths allowing for antiferromagnetic ordering a big enhancement of the @xmath13-effective mass is apparent in the vicinity of the magnetic transition . in the paramagnetic phase ,",

    "the important point however is that the dca+qmc approximation gives an extremely good account of the single - particle spectral function both in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "hence , and as far as we can test against benchmark results , the combination of static magnetic ordering and dynamical kondo screening , as realized in the dca , provides a very good approximation of the underlying physics . + as opposed to _ exact _",
    "lattice qmc auxiliary field simulations , which fail away from the particle - hole symmetric point due to the so - called negative sign problem , the dca+qmc approach allows us to take steps away from this symmetry either by doping or by introducing a finite value of @xmath26 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that for cluster sizes up to @xmath0 orbitals the limiting factor is the cubic scaling of the hirsch - fye algorithm rather than the negative sign problem which turns out to be very mild in the considered parameter range .",

    ", magnetism alone will not account for the insulating state and the observed quasi - particle gap can only be interpreted in terms of kondo screening .",
    "the absence of kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram is equally confirmed by the single - particle spectral function which always shows a feature reminiscent of the heavy - fermion band.@xcite + ii ) the transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is continuous and is associated with the backfolding of the large heavy fermion fermi surface .",
    "+ iii ) within the antiferromagnetic metallic phase there is a fermi surface topology change from hole pockets centered around @xmath86 at _ small _ values of the magnetization @xmath159 to one centered around @xmath192 at _ larger _ values of @xmath159 .",
    "the latter fermi surface is adiabatically connected to one where the @xmath13-spins are frozen and in which kondo screening is completely absent .",
    "@xcite this transition comes about by _ continuously deforming",
    "_ a heavy - fermion band such that the effective mass grows substantially on both sides of the transition . within a mean - field modelling of the quantum monte carlo",
    "results the transition in the fermi surface topology corresponds to two continuous lifshitz transitions . as a function of decreasing mean - field kondo screening parameter @xmath172 and at constant hole doping , the volume of the hole pocket at @xmath86 decreases at the expense of the increase of volume of the hole pocket at @xmath108 .",
    "owing to the luttinger sum rule , the total volume of the hole pockets remains constant .",
