    "a key aspect of cellular dynamics is the ability to adapt metabolic activity to changing environments .",
    "this involves a dynamic re - organization of enzyme expression levels , in order to accommodate for variability in nutrient abundance and environmental shocks that have a deleterious impact on growth .",
    "these adaptations emerge from a complex array of regulatory interactions between metabolism and the genetic machinery . since many of these interactions are unknown or incompletely understood , a fully mechanistic grasp of how they control metabolic adaptations is currently beyond our reach .",
    "moreover , the analysis of large - scale mechanistic models is typically hampered by the high number of molecular species and parameters involved .",
    "an alternative approach to predict metabolic adaptations is to assume an underlying optimality principle @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have considered metabolic adaptations in microbes by computing optimal metabolic fluxes in a stoichiometric model under a suitable objective function @xcite .",
    "stoichiometric models are a structural description of a metabolic network and can not provide information on the enzyme concentrations .",
    "several approaches have attempted to overcome this by integrating gene regulation with stoichiometric models , either by modelling enzyme expression qualitatively with boolean variables describing regulatory effects @xcite , or by explicitly including enzyme capacity constraints in the optimization problems @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach are the cybernetic models @xcite , where regulation is explicitly modelled and assumed to optimize a cellular objective .",
    "while the classical cybernetic approach explicitly includes reaction kinetics in the model , a hybrid approach has been suggested @xcite , where the rates are determined from flux balance analysis .",
    "models that integrate metabolism and gene expression can potentially yield better predictions than those focused on metabolism in isolation .",
    "this can be particularly helpful in metabolic adaptations caused by environmental fluctuations . to capture the dynamics of biomass and gene expression linked to metabolic activity , previous studies",
    "have mostly used ad - hoc combinations of various modeling frameworks .",
    "examples are combinations of constraint - based steady state models with ordinary differential equations or boolean regulatory logic @xcite .",
    "this combination approach has been successful in proposing integrated models up to whole - cell dynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a dynamic modeling framework for metabolic networks coupled with gene expression of enzymes and production of other macromolecules .",
    "we develop an optimization algorithm to predict optimal time courses for nutrient uptake , metabolic fluxes , and gene expression rates in such networks .",
    "the classical approach to constraint - based optimization of metabolic fluxes , commonly called flux balance analysis ( fba ) , relies on an optimization problem with algebraic constraints stemming from a steady state restriction @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the fba approach in the simplest form leads to a linear program of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reaction flux vector , @xmath2 a biomass weighting vector , @xmath3 the stoichiometric matrix , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are lower and upper component - wise bounds on the fluxes , respectively .",
    "while the most common optimization objective is the maximization of biomass production , an experimental evaluation also highlighted additional biologically relevant objectives @xcite .",
    "one point of critique to fba is its coarse description of the biomass composition . while growth - dependent changes in the biomass composition have been taken into account in the past @xcite , constraints related to the actual biomass composition by enzymes or other cellular macromolecules are usually not considered . at least on the level of individual metabolic pathways ,",
    "there is good evidence that the enzyme production cost is an important factor in the regulation of these pathways @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that the inclusion of biomass composition and enzyme costs in metabolic optimization can potentially improve the quality of its predictions . as an extension to fba in this direction , the resource balance analysis ( rba ) approach has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this includes the conversion of metabolites into specific enzymes and other proteins in the network , and adds the enzymatic capacity as constraint on metabolic fluxes for the optimization .",
    "rba yields a linear optimization problem and can intrinsically describe changes in both the growth rate and biomass composition due to environmental changes from an optimization principle alone .",
    "a conceptually equivalent approach has been proposed independently in @xcite under the term me ( metabolism and macromolecular expression ) model .",
    "both approaches are however limited to situations of steady exponential growth .    for batch processes or in changing environments , the model needs to go beyond the stationary approach and account for dynamic changes in metabolic activity .",
    "fba has been used to predict dynamic changes in biomass and nutrients using iterative approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the iterative optimization uses a steady state constraint and does not account for the model dynamics , and thus the predictions may not be optimal in changing environments .",
    "dynamic effects are physiologically important , as is evidenced by the experimental observation that even in steady state , cells would show flux distributions which are slightly suboptimal , but which allow for easier transitions to other environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "also , the numerical accuracy of the iterative approach can at best be evaluated heuristically or by numerical experimentation , unless specialized numerical algorithms are applied @xcite .    by formulating an appropriate dynamic optimization problem",
    ", it is possible to compute optimal fluxes over the whole time range of interest .",
    "this approach has been proposed in dynamic flux balance analysis ( dfba ) @xcite . in dfba",
    ", one can distinguish between a `` static optimization approach ( soa ) '' , similar to the previously used iterative fba @xcite , and a `` dynamic optimization approach ( doa ) '' .",
    "the static approach is useful to get feasible nutrient and biomass dynamics under metabolic constraints , but it can not resolve the optimization problem over the complete timescale of interest .",
    "the dynamic approach doa directly considers an objective function which depends on the dynamics over the complete timescale , potentially under dynamic metabolic constraints , and thus provides a consistent solution to the dynamic optimization problem .",
    "however , in the same way as classical fba , dynamic fba uses only a coarse description of biomass composition .",
    "biomass is captured only as one component , and different allocations of biomass to different metabolic tasks , such as considered in rba , can not be represented .",
    "in the study described here , we developed a mathematical framework for dynamic models of coupled metabolism and gene expression .",
    "we denote such models with the term _ metabolic - genetic networks_. from a rigorous timescale separation , we approximate this model by a quasi steady state , constraint - based part for the intracellular metabolism , and a dynamic part for the evolution of biomass and substrate concentrations . for this model class",
    ", we developed a dynamic optimization approach , called _ dynamic enzyme - cost fba _",
    "( defba ) , that includes a detailed description of biomass and accounts for the enzyme cost .",
    "the defba method respects biophysical constraints motivated from resource balance analysis @xcite , and additionally includes dynamic changes in biomass composition and substrate concentrations .    in table",
    "[ tab : fba - scheme ] we compare our defba approach to the established methods available in the literature .",
    "the distinction among the methods is based on two criteria : one for the type of optimization approach ( static , iterative , or dynamic ) and one for whether the enzyme production cost is taken into account for the optimization or not .",
    "the comparison highlights the improved generality of defba compared to established methods with respect to these two criteria .    .",
    "* different flux optimization approaches * [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : scenarios - initial ]      we used our defba algorithm to predict the substrate concentrations , biomass composition , and growth kinetics under three metabolic adaptation scenarios : carbon switch , oxygen limitation and rich medium growth . since the analysis of the minimal network suggested that maximizing the discounted biomass integral is a biologically reasonable objective in a dynamic setting , we used this objective functional for the analysis of the core carbon network .",
    "we modeled each scenario by manipulating the initial conditions of the model as detailed in table [ tab : scenarios - initial ] .",
    "we computed the initial biomass composition by resource balance analysis ( rba ) @xcite so as to yield maximal aerobic growth rate on @xmath6 alone .",
    "the initial biomass composition thus corresponded to a cellular state pre - adapted to such an environment .",
    "rba determines the biomass distribution for the maximal growth rate in steady state exponential growth , thus avoiding spurious transients caused by a non - optimal initial composition of biomass .",
    "we assumed the culture to be run as an aerated batch process .",
    "the extracellular oxygen dynamics were modeled by the differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the oxygen inflow and @xmath9 the ventilation rate , with different values per scenario as given in table  [ tab : scenarios - initial ] .",
    "oxygen turnover described by   is added to the full biological model for the dynamic optimization .",
    "the objective functional is the discounted biomass integral @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the weight vector for the individual biomass components as given in table  [ tab : core - network - biomass ] , @xmath12 contains the reaction products of the biomass reactions listed in table  [ tab : core - network - biomass ] , and @xmath13 is the discount factor as given in table  [ tab : scenarios - initial ] for the three scenarios .",
    "in addition to the enzyme capacity constraint , we used a biomass composition constraint to ensure that the structural component @xmath3 makes up for at least 35 % of total biomass : @xmath14      in this scenario , we studied cellular growth under both carbon sources , with a low concentration for a preferred carbon source @xmath6 , and a high concentration of the other carbon source @xmath15 .",
    "the optimization predicted four distinct growth phases , labelled a  d in figure  [ fig : core - network - results - carbon ] . in phase",
    "a , cells grew exclusively on @xmath6 .",
    "after its depletion , they switched to @xmath15 uptake ( phase b ) .",
    "the optimization predicted a nutrient uptake pattern comparable to catabolite repression @xcite , where a preferred carbon source is completely consumed before cells switch to the non - preferred carbon source . in the growth phases a and b , cells produced the waste metabolite @xmath16 . when both carbon sources were consumed , the optimization predicted re - consumption of the previously excreted waste metabolite @xmath16 ( phase c ) , thus being able to sustain growth , though at a significantly lower rate .",
    "the stationary phase d was reached after complete consumption of the substrate .",
    "the predictions seem to indicate a significant intracellular reorganization well before the complete depletion of the second carbon source ( see figure  [ fig : core - network - results - carbon]b  c ) .",
    "this means that the optimal response suggests a cellular adaptation to the impending nutrient depletion , reminiscent of changes in gene regulation observed in _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ just before a glucose  gluconeogenic switch @xcite .",
    "it is known that some microorganisms , for example _ bacillus subtilis _ , monitor the ratio of population size to nutrient availability by quorum sensing @xcite , which could allow them to predict an upcoming nutrient depletion and appropriately adjust their gene expression levels before starvation .     for enzyme labels .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : core - network - results - carbon]d illustrates the predicted reorganization of the metabolic network in terms of the enzyme activities .",
    "glycolysis , represented by the enzyme @xmath17 , was only active in phases a and b. the @xmath18-@xmath19 cycle , involving enzymes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , was most active in phase c , where @xmath22 production from glycolysis ceased and had to be substituted by respiration .",
    "there was a significant drop in activity of the amino acid synthesis pathway represented by @xmath23 in phase c , presumabely related to the lower enzyme and ribosome biomass fraction in that phase .          in this scenario",
    ", we studied cell growth under limited oxygen availability .",
    "the defba predictions display five growth phases , labelled a  e in figure  [ fig : core - network - results - anaerobic ] . in phase",
    "a , cells grew aerobically on @xmath6 . in phase b ,",
    "oxygen was depleted and cells continued to grow anaerobically , producing both waste metabolites @xmath24 and @xmath16 .",
    "there was also a significant drop in the growth rate during phase b. the growth phases c and d show that there is also a preferential order in the re - metabolization of waste products .",
    "with the small continuous supply of oxygen that is considered in the model , cells first grew exclusively on @xmath24 ( phase c ) , consuming @xmath16 only after @xmath24 has been depleted ( phase d ) .",
    "phase e was then the stationary phase .    from the enzyme activities shown in figure  [ fig : core - network - results - anaerobic]d , we got similar results as in scenario 1 concerning glycolysis and amino acid synthesis . according to the oxygen limitation",
    ", there was a significant drop in the respiratory activity , represented by the enzyme @xmath25 , after phase  a.      in this scenario , we studied the effect of adding amino acids ( @xmath26 ) and lipids ( @xmath27 ) to the medium for cells grown previously on @xmath6 alone .",
    "initially , cells were assumed to be pre - adapted to a medium without amino acids and lipids , and the optimization predicted an initial transient where cells adapted to the new medium .",
    "the model predicts expression of amino acid and lipid transporters so as to shift from synthesis to uptake of amino acids and lipids from the medium .",
    "we then observed five growth phases , labelled a  e in figure  [ fig : core - network - results - rich ] .    in phase",
    "a , where also the generic amino acid @xmath28 is available in the medium , cells grew with a significantly higher rate than in the other scenarios .",
    "this higher growth rate presumably results from decreased enzyme cost for biosynthesis pathways during this phase .",
    "also , during phases a and b the ribosomal biomass fraction was significantly increased ( figure  [ fig : core - network - results - rich]c ) , while the enzymatic biomass fraction was reduced .",
    "this agrees with previous studies about the dependence of the growth rate on global cellular parameters , where increased mrna and decreased protein fractions have been associated with increased growth rate @xcite .",
    "after depletion of external @xmath29 and @xmath28 , the ratio between ribosomes and enzymes returned to the original state , while the cells continued to grow on @xmath6 alone ( phase c ) . when @xmath6 was depleted , cells re - metabolized the waste product @xmath16 ( phase d ) , before entering stationary phase ( e ) .    an additional observation from the enzyme activities shown in figure  [ fig : core - network - results - rich]d is that glycolysis was most active only in phase b , presumably due to the need of precursor molecules for amino acid synthesis after the extracellular supply of @xmath28 had been used up .",
    "in this paper we have presented a dynamic optimization approach for metabolic networks coupled with gene expression .",
    "the proposed defba method can be used to predict the dynamic adaptation of intracellular metabolites and biomass composition under environmental perturbations .",
    "based on a biophysically motivated approximation by separation of timescales , we obtained a reduced model for metabolic networks coupled with biomass dynamics . in the reduced model ,",
    "the metabolic fluxes are computed from a quasi steady state approximation , while the nutrient concentrations , enzyme expression levels and other biomass components are described by a system of differential equations .",
    "the inclusion of a detailed biomass composition with constraints on fluxes from enzyme capacity was previously proposed in rba @xcite and me networks @xcite for steady state models .",
    "we developed a dynamic optimization method , called dynamic enzyme - cost flux balance analysis ( defba ) , which includes the biomass composition and related enzyme capacity constraints in a dynamic model .",
    "the algorithm allows predicting the time courses of metabolic fluxes and biomass concentrations from an optimality principle .",
    "our approach provides a generalization to the currently established dynamic flux balance analysis ( dfba ) reported in @xcite , and offers two advantages .",
    "firstly , it can readily account for constraints on enzyme levels and their biosynthetic cost .",
    "secondly , it is based on computationally efficient linear optimization techniques and thus seems well suited for large scale networks .",
    "computational costs can become particularly limiting in dfba , as it is based on non - linear optimization techniques that are hard to scale with network size .",
    "in addition , defba solves one optimization problem for the dynamics over the complete time interval , thus also avoiding numerical problems in differential equations constrained by linear programs @xcite , as encountered in iterative fba or the static optimization approach of dfba @xcite .",
    "the defba approach allows predicting changes in the enzyme expression levels from an optimization principle alone , without the need of explicit models for gene regulatory interactions as proposed in other fba - related methods @xcite .",
    "we exploited this feature by using defba to predict metabolic adaptations in two biologically relevant metabolic - genetic systems : a minimal nutrient uptake network and a larger core carbon uptake system .",
    "for the minimal network we showed numerically and analytically that the optimal growth kinetics are composed of an exponential and a stationary phase .",
    "these biphasic growth kinetics appear in the solutions that maximize the discounted biomass integral or minimize the nutrient metabolization time .",
    "we subsequently found that these optimal growth kinetics are essentially equivalent to the classical monod model of bacterial growth @xcite and can be accurately modeled with uptake kinetics following a michaelis - menten law .",
    "this result can be interpreted as a rigorous derivation of the monod growth model , which was so far an empirical model based on observed growth dynamics .",
    "the close correspondence of the monod growth model with the dynamic optimization results suggests that maximization of the discounted biomass integral or the minimization of the metabolization time are biologically plausible objectives in a dynamic context , and in fact both have been previously used in evolutionary @xcite or metabolic pathway studies @xcite , respectively .",
    "the plausibility of other objective functionals should also be examined in defba , similarly as has been done for static flux balance analysis @xcite .",
    "however , some objectives which have been proposed there , such as the maximization of @xmath22 production , seem to be more appropriate for networks focussing on the metabolic level alone , and may not be appropriate for metabolic - genetic networks .",
    "a dynamic optimization approach opens up the possibility of using other objective functions that do not apply in a static setting , such as the minimization of the metabolization time introduced in section  [ sec : analys - minim - metab ] .",
    "we also considered the maximization of the final biomass in the minimal network , as this was one of the original objectives proposed with dfba @xcite .",
    "the predictions , however , showed a significant variability due to non - uniqueness of the optimal solution .",
    "non - unique optimal solutions are a common problem with all constraint - based models @xcite . in networks with two equivalent parallel pathways ,",
    "classical fba would not be able to predict which of the two is active .",
    "this situation can be remedied by considering different enzyme costs for the two pathways , as first suggested in @xcite for static optimization , and in our study for the dynamic case ( section  [ sec : carb - switch - scen ] ) .",
    "the use of static objective functionals in a dynamic setting can aggravate the problem of non - uniqueness .",
    "for example , as we observed in figure  [ fig : result - min - metabogen ] , when maximizing the terminal biomass , a dynamic approach may not be able to decide whether a single pathway is active early or late within the considered time horizon .",
    "the alternative objective functionals that we proposed in this study remedied the problem of non - unique optimal solutions in the time domain , as growth at an earlier time would give a better objective functional value than growth at a later time .",
    "our study on the core carbon network used a larger model that includes the uptake of different extracellular species ( including nutrients , oxygen , and organic precursor molecules ) together with some of the main energy turnover processes , and the assembly of ribosomes and enzymes .",
    "we applied the defba method to predict the growth kinetics and time courses for substrates and biomass composition that maximized the discounted biomass integral in three scenarios .",
    "these scenarios were chosen from classical examples of metabolic adaptation processes : the switch from one carbon source to another , growth under reduced oxygen availability , and the transition of cells to a rich medium , which subsequently gets depleted of nutrients .",
    "the resulting growth kinetics reproduce a number of known biological observations , such as the overall cellular composition under different growth conditions @xcite or a hierarchy of preferences for different carbon sources @xcite .",
    "the results show that a significant change in gene regulation before an impending nutrient depletion would be optimal for cellular growth . in view of recent experimental results on gene regulation during the glycolytic - gluconeogenic switch @xcite",
    ", we suggest growth optimality over the full time period as theoretical explanation for regulatory activity before the switching time point .    the metabolic part of the model in section  [ sec : dynam - optim - core ]",
    "was first analyzed with regulatory fba ( rfba ) in @xcite .",
    "we compared these results to our results obtained by the defba method .",
    "both approaches result in a sequence of growth phases with a distinct metabolic flux pattern . for the specific scenarios , both the carbon switch and the anaerobic growth",
    "have also been studied in @xcite and gave similar results , for example the preference for one carbon source over the other .",
    "importantly , in rfba , this preference resulted from explicitly building it into the regulatory logic , while with defba , it followed implicitly from the different enzymatic efficiencies and metabolic costs of the alternative pathways . while our results predict the re - metabolization of fermentation products , similar to an observed acetate re - utilization in _",
    "e.  coli _",
    "@xcite , which has also been reproduced in iterative fba @xcite and dynamic fba @xcite , the corresponding reactions seemed to be modelled as irreversible in the rfba study @xcite , which would have prevented the re - metabolization there .    an important general distinction between rfba and defba concerns the biological knowledge required to build the network models . in rfba ,",
    "fluxes are constrained by boolean rules modeling regulatory mechanisms , which have to be known in the modeling step . with defba ,",
    "regulatory interactions are not included in the model , but the specific enzymes for each reaction together with their metabolic production costs are added to the network and thus need to be known .",
    "importantly , these two approaches do not exclude each other : it should be well possible to construct network models with both regulatory constraints and constraints from the capacity and metabolic costs of individual enzymes .",
    "although we have focussed on the metabolic constraints relating to enzymatic capacity , the defba framework readily allows for inclusion of thermodynamic constraints on metabolic fluxes @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent study has suggested that constraints on gene regulatory mechanisms may also be relevant and contribute to some mismatch between observed gene expression and fitness levels predicted from the theoretical optimum based on metabolic constraints @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of suitable constraints on the regulatory mechanisms in a metabolic optimization framework is an open problem , but we suggest that it may become tractable in a dynamic optimization setup such as defba , for example by including metabolic costs of gene regulation . in addition , the objective functions considered here do not take the robustness against unpredictable changes in the environment into account , which may also contribute to slower growth than predicted from a pure growth rate optimization @xcite .",
    "in essence , the approach presented here can predict the temporal regulation of gene expression from an optimization principle , without requiring any knowledge of regulatory interactions .",
    "it yields predictions for biomass dynamics in metabolic adaptations , while respecting constraints of enzymatic capacity and mass conservation .",
    "since the reaction fluxes @xmath30 and the cellular volume @xmath31 are assumed to be slowly varying , we could rewrite them on the long time scale as @xmath32 even in the limit @xmath33 .    on the long time scale ,",
    "the metabolic - genetic network is then rewritten as @xmath34 where we used @xmath35 to denote the time derivative on the long time scale .",
    "based on the model  , the quasi steady state equation for condition  1 in section  [ sec : rigor - deriv - quasi ] is given by @xmath36 and the boundary layer model   is more explicitly written as @xmath37 where the slow variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath12 are considered as constant in   and  .",
    "the reduced model is constructed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the solution to the quasi steady state constraint  .",
