    "among the key insights in quantum information that follow from the statistical properties of quantum states in high - dimensional hilbert spaces is that the overwhelming majority of pure bipartite states are very close to being maximally entangled .",
    "more precisely , consider pure , normalized , quantum states @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are hilbert spaces of finite dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , and for a given @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be its reduced density matrix in @xmath2 ; that is , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the partial trace over the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "a standard measure of the entanglement of @xmath5 is the so - called _ entanglement entropy _ , defined as the von neumann entropy @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 when @xmath11 is separable and @xmath12 when @xmath13 is maximally entangled .",
    "a well known result , motivated by an initial estimate of lubkin @xcite , later conjectured by page @xcite , and finally proved by foong and kanno @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , is that the average entanglement entropy over all pure states @xmath5 , when @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 which for @xmath16 gives @xmath17 , the maximal entanglement entropy , up to corrections of order @xmath18 ( here , and henceforth , random states @xmath19 are understood to be uniformly sampled on the hypersphere @xmath20 ; that is , according to the pushforward of the @xmath21 haar measure under the action of @xmath21 on a fixed normalized vector of @xmath22 ) .",
    "since then , a better understanding of the ubiquity of near - maximal entanglement in the bipartite setting @xcite has been a subject of considerable interest , fuelled in part by its relevance to several important applications in quantum information ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , such as random quantum circuits @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , random quantum channels @xcite equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and thermalization @xcite , among others .",
    "one aspect of the problem that has earned particular attention is the statistics of the spectrum of the partial density matrix @xmath6 , the non - zero part of which corresponds to the so - called _ schmidt spectrum _ , the squares of the coefficients appearing in the schmidt ( i.e. , singular value ) decomposition of the state @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath19 is sampled uniformly , as defined previously , the resulting ensemble of random reduced density matrices @xmath6 is an ensemble that is also known in the random matrix theory ( rmt ) literarure as the fixed trace wishart - laguerre ( ftwl ) ensemble with dyson index @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the joint probability density function ( pdf ) for the unordered schmidt spectrum induced by the uniformly - sampled pure state ensemble was first obtained by lloyd and pagels @xcite and is given by @xmath24 where it is understood that @xmath14 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( henceforth we shall use the symbol @xmath27 for spectral probability densities and the standard @xmath6 for density matrices ) .",
    "this pdf contains all the necessary information to derive , at least in principle , the statistical properties of any function of the quantum state that is invariant under local unitary transformations .",
    "indeed , a fair amount of progress has been made in obtaining exact results for several quantities of interest , such as moments and correlations of traces of powers of @xmath6 and its entropy @xcite , the average eigenvalue pdf @xcite , the smallest eigenvalue pdf @xcite and the largest eigenvalue pdfs @xcite . for general values of @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "these exact formulas tend to be rather complicated and are therefore of limited practical use .",
    "however , considerable simplifications emerge in the asymptotic limit @xmath28 , with the ratio @xmath18 fixed , using well - known asymptotic techniques in rmt .",
    "in particular , it follows that the asymptotic eigenvalue density ( aed ) for the rescaled eigenvalues @xmath29 , satisfies a marenko - pastur law @xcite(see also @xcite ) , as in the unconstrained wishart ensemble , with parameters given by the ratio of dimensions @xmath30 : @xmath31}(x)dx ,    , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 , and @xmath33}(x)$ ] is the indicator function in the interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "reference @xcite also provides useful asymptotic results for the distribution of the renyi entanglement entropies ( including the von neumann entropy ) , and the distribution of the largest schmidt eigenvalue .    motivated by the general question of how random bipartite states concentrate around the maximally entangled state , in this paper we address a closely related problem :",
    "suppose two random bipartite states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are uniformly sampled independently from @xmath22 , and their corresponding partial density matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are computed in @xmath2 .",
    "for appropriately large dimensions , with @xmath14 , we expect @xmath39 .",
    "our question is then : how close are the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 from each other ?",
    "more specifically , we will examine the eigenvalue statistics for the difference matrix @xmath42 from which various distance measures can be calculated .",
    "in fact , the ensemble of matrices @xmath43 defines a unitarily invariant random matrix ensemble , a fact that automatically implies that @xmath40 and @xmath41 can not be `` too close '' , given the well - known phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion that characterizes unitarily invariant ensembles , among others .",
    "moreover , unitary invariance allows us to use powerful tools to derive exact , though cumbersome , expressions for the joint pdf of the eigenvalues for finite @xmath44 , as well as a relatively simple formula for the aed and its moments in the asymptotic limit @xmath45 with a fixed ratio @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , we derive the exact expression for the joint eigenvalue pdf in the finite @xmath44 case , and in the asymptotic limit , obtain closed form expressions for the aed and its moments ; second , using these results , we derive the almost sure asymptotic values of the trace distance @xmath46 and the operator norm distance @xmath47 , both of which are especially relevant for applications to quantum information theory .",
    "the structure and summary of results of the paper is as follows : in section [ section_results ] we present our main results in the form of three new theorems ( theorems [ exact_theorem ] , [ disttheorem ] , [ momentsth ] ) and two corollaries ( corollaries [ corollary_op_norm ] , [ corollary ] ) , and the remaining sections are devoted to the proofs of these results .",
    "the first result is a closed - form formula for the joint eigenvalue pdf for the difference matrix ensemble , which follows from applying a powerful technique of christandl _ _ et al.__@xcite , the so - called _ derivative principle _ , which we reproduce here as theorem [ derivativethm ] .",
    "the derivative principle provides a connection between the joint eigenvalue pdf and the joint pdf of the diagonal matrix elements of a unitarily invariant random matrix ensemble that is then exploited in our first main result , theorem [ exact_theorem ] , to obtain a closed form expression for the joint eigenvalue pdf in terms of associated laguerre polynomials , valid for arbitrary dimensions @xmath4 and @xmath3 with @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting formula is quite complicated , but may nevertheless prove useful for small @xmath4 and @xmath3 ; in particular , the specialization to the case @xmath48 and general @xmath3 yields a relatively tractable formula . section [ section_exact ] provides a proof of these results , including an alternative proof of the derivative principle that uses standard random matrix theory techniques .",
    "the next set of results are concerned with the asymptotics of the eigenvalue pdf of the difference matrix @xmath43 .",
    "theorem [ disttheorem ] gives the aed for @xmath49 for all fixed values of the ratio @xmath30 ( here , the constraint @xmath50 is relaxed ) , a result that is proved in section [ section_asymptotic ] using standard results from free probability theory @xcite .",
    "the aed shows an interesting transition at the critical value @xmath51 . for values of @xmath52 ,",
    "the aed has positive support in the region @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , whereas for values of @xmath55 , the aed has positive support in the two regions defined by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , and a dirac point measure at the origin .",
    "our other main result , presented in theorem [ momentsth ] , is an expression for the absolute moments ( including moments of complex order ) of the aed , again for all values of @xmath58 , a result that is proved in section [ section_moments ] using carlson s theorem .",
    "the two corollaries to our main results involve the asymptotic almost sure behavior of two distance measures between the independent partial density matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 , namely the operator norm distance ( corollary [ corollary_op_norm ] ) , which is obtained from the upper support point @xmath59 of the aed , and the trace norm distance ( corollary [ corollary ] ) , which follows from theorem [ momentsth ] when specialized to the first absolute moment .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two hilbert spaces of dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "now let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be two normalized random pure states in the tensor product hilbert space @xmath22 , which are uniformly and independently sampled , and define @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the corresponding reduced density matrices for the system @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "finally , define the difference matrix @xmath43 as @xmath64 for this difference matrix ensemble , our main results are concerned with the exact joint eigenvalue probability pdf @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the ( unordered ) eigenvalues of @xmath43 , and the aed , the single - eigenvalue marginal of @xmath65 in the asymptotic limit @xmath67 , with fixed ratio @xmath18 .",
    "we begin with the exact joint eigenvalue pdf for all @xmath44 , but with the provision that @xmath14 .",
    "the result is presented in the form of two theorems , of which the first is a recasting of a previous result and the second one is the original result . both theorems will be proved in section [ section_exact ] .",
    "theorem [ derivativethm ] establishes an extremely useful connection between the joint pdf of the eigenvalues of a unitarily - invariant random matrix ensemble and the joint pdf of the matrix diagonal elements of the same ensemble , which in general is considerably simpler to compute .",
    "this result is known in more general form from the theory of duistermaat - heckman ( dh ) measures @xcite which are measures on the dual lie algebra of a lie group with a hamiltonian action on a symplectic manifold , obtained from the push - forward of the liouville measure along the corresponding moment map .",
    "it concerns the connection between the so - called _ non - abelian _ dh - measure for the hamiltonian action of a compact connected lie group and the _ abelian _ dh - measure for its maximal torus @xcite .",
    "recently , christandl _ et al _ @xcite have used this connection , under the name of the _ derivative pinciple _",
    ", for the computation of the eigenvalue pdfs of reduced density matrices of multipartite - entangled states . as",
    "this derivative principle is surprisingly not as well known as it should be in the context of random matrices , we recast it here and prove it in the following section using the standard language of random matrix theory :    [ derivativethm ] let @xmath43 be a random matrix drawn from a unitarily invariant random matrix ensemble , @xmath68 the joint eigenvalue pdf for @xmath43 and @xmath69 the joint pdf of the diagonal elements of @xmath43 .",

    "this theorem proves to be particularly useful to compute the joint eigenvalue pdf of the sum of independent random matrices drawn from unitarily invariant ensembles , given that the joint pdf of the diagonal elements is the convolution of the respective joint pdfs .",
    "this is precisely the case at hand for the ensemble of random matrices @xmath74 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the partial density matrices of two independent random bipartite states .",
    "theorem [ exact_theorem ] gives a contour integral expression ( or what equivalently can be cast as a constant term identity ) for the joint pdf of the diagonal elements for our difference ensemble ( an alternative expression in terms of lauricella generalized hypergeometric functions is given at the end of section [ psi_subs ] ) :    [ exact_theorem ] let @xmath74 be the ensemble of difference matrices as defined at the beginning of the section .",
    "then , the joint pdf of diagonal elements @xmath75 of @xmath43 is given by the contour integral @xmath76 where the contour encircles the origin , @xmath77 are the associated laguerre polynomials , @xmath78 the surface delta function @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the indicator function on the @xmath81 dimensional region @xmath82 in @xmath83 defined by the minkowski difference set @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the standard probability simplex .",
