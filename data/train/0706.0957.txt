    "the real algebraic variety of representations from a @xmath8-manifold group @xmath9 to @xmath7 or @xmath10 has long been a subject of interest , giving rise as it does to useful invariants such as the casson invariant and the @xmath0-polynomial @xcite .    in the case where @xmath11 is a torus  in particular , where @xmath12 is the exterior of a knot in @xmath13  there is a particular interest in finding representations which vanish on a given slope @xmath14 on @xmath11 , and",
