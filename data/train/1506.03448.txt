    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "it is an essential element in many physical processes , such as the formation of stars ( federrath & klessen 2012 ; burkhart , collins & lazarian 2015 ) and transport of cosmic rays ( lazarian & yan 2014 ) , and is a large fraction of the energy budget of the milky way ( see elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "the evidence for the existence of turbulence in the ism is overwhelming and includes the `` big power law '' and `` extended power law '' of the electron density fluctuations in armstrong et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and chepurnov & lazarian ( 2010 ) , respectively , fractal structure of molecular clouds ( stutzki et al . 1998 ) , and intensity fluctuations and broadened linewidths in channel maps ( see crovisier & dickey 1983 , green 1993 , stanimirovic et al . 1999 ,",
    "deshpande , dwarakanath & goss 2000 ) . despite the importance of ism turbulence for a wide range of physical processes in galaxies , little",
    "is known about it due to the difficulty of measuring the velocity power spectrum of turbulence which provides information on the injection and dissipation scales , energy amplitude , and spectral slope .    for studies of turbulence , velocity fluctuations reflected in position - postion - velocity ( ppv )",
    "radio cubes are critical as they trace the underlying fluid behavior . along with density fluctuations they contribute to the intensity fluctuations in ppv space . as such , many techniques for analyzing ppv fluctuations in the context of turbulence",
    "have been proposed including velocity centroids ( esquivel & lazarian 2005a , b ; ossenkopf et al .",
    "2006 ; esquivel et al .",
    "2007 ) , hierarchical tree methods ( goodman et al . 2009 ; burkhart et al . 2013 ) , principal component analysis ( heyer & schloerb 1997 ) and the @xmath0 variance technique ( ossenkopf et al .",
    "2008a , b ) however , these techniques face difficulty to reliably separate out the underlying velocity and density contributions in ppv space in the supersonic limit .",
    "this is essential for obtaining the velocity power spectrum of turbulence in astrophysical settings .",
    "for the purpose of obtaining the velocity power spectrum the velocity channel analysis ( vca , lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2004 , henceforth lp00 , lp04 ) and velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs , see lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2006 , 2008 , henceforth , lp00 , lp06 , lp08 ) have been developed based on analytic expression for the behavior of the correlation function ( which is isomorphic to the power spectrum ) in ppv space .",
    "a concise review of these extensive works is given in lazarian ( 2009 ) .",
    "the vcs and vca techniques are entirely data driven ( i.e. comparisons or scaling to numerical simulations are not required ) and are complimentary to each other as the success of the vca application depends primarily on the spatial resolution while the vcs depends primarily on the spectral resolution .",
    "this is because the vca technique is concerned with taking the spatial power spectrum of the two - dimensional slices of ppv while the vcs studies the fluctuations of ppv intensities along the velocity coordinate of the ppv cube .",
    "both techniques have been applied to multi - wavelength observations as well as undergone numerical tests ( stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ; chepurnov et al .",
    "2010 ; chepurnov et al .",
    "2009 )    in this paper we apply the vcs to the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) in 21 cm emission .",
    "the smc is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group which has a gas rich ism environment and is metal poor ( see , stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999 , henceforth known as sx99 ) .",
    "the smc is nearby ( 60 kpc ; westerlund 1991 ) and is close enough to have resolved scales hi from @xmath1 4.5kpc down to 30pc .",
    "this is in contrast to clouds in the milky way where distance determination is relatively uncertain and special geometrical considerations must be taken into account for application of the vcs as was done in the application of the vcs in high latitude hi data ( chepurnov et al .",
    "another advantage of investigating the smc is that it has been used as a test bed for numerous turbulence studies .",
    "hi observations of the smc , obtained using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes telescope ( sx99 ) , have already been studied with the vca technique ( stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ) as well as the traditional power spectrum .",
    "other statistics were applied to the smc by burkhart et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which provide information on compressibility , ( i.e. sonic mach number ) such as the pdfs and spatial power spectrum .",
    "in addition , the topology of the smc and its relation to the turbulence environment was quantified using the genus statistic in chepurnov et al .",
    "because the sx99 smc data set is so well studied , it is a perfect candidate to test and compare the newer vcs technique .",
    "thus by studying this data set we can acquire new information , test and confirm past results , and validate the promise of these tools for further use in other observational studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : smc ] we describe the smc hi data set used , in section [ sec : vcs ] we review the vcs technique , in section [ sec : res ] we detail the results of our analysis and finally in sections and [ sec : disc ] and [ sec : con ] we discuss the implications of our findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "the smc hi data set used in our analysis combines both single dish ( parkes , stanimirovic et al . 1999 ) and interferometer ( atca , staveley - smith et al .",
    "1997 ) both sets of observations were then combined ( see stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999 ) , resulting in the final hi data cube with angular resolution of 98@xmath2 , velocity resolution of 1.65 , and 1-@xmath3 brightness temperature sensitivity of 1.3 k. the data has a continuous range of spatial scales between 30 pc and 4 kpc .",
    "the velocity range of the observations is 90 - 215 . for more details about the atca and parkes observations , data processing , and data combination ( short spacings correction )",
    "see staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and stanimirovic et al .",
    "hi self - absorption we corrected for following the scheme of stanimirovic et al .",
    "the correspondent hi intensity image is shown in figure  [ fig : smc ] .",
    "the suggestion to analyze the data calculating the spectrum along the velocity axis of ppv cubes was first made in lp00 and elaborated in lv06 .",
    "it was only later that the technique was applied to actual observational data ( see padoan et al .",
    "2009 , chepurnov et a. 2010 ) .",
    "lp06 mostly dealt with the asymptotic scaling of turbulence and the observational study by padoan et al .",
    "2009 is an illustration of the application of the vcs to molecular clouds .",
    "the vcs was applied to galactic hi data in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) not only to obtain the spectral slope , but also the injection scale of the turbulence as well as other pieces of useful information . here",
    "we will review the main points of the vcs technique following the way as it is presented in chepurnov & lazarian ( 2009 ) .",
    "below we briefly present the idea of the vcs technique . a more detailed discussion , including the analysis of the effects of absorption is given in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 ) . the contributions to the ppv power spectrum",
    "is are coming the power spectrum of velocity , @xmath4 , and the power spectrum of emissivity , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the wavevector and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spatial scale power spectra @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , determine the turbulent cascade of energy and the distribution of density in the interstellar medium .",
    "the vcs technique obtains the underlying velocity power spectrum by calculating the 1d fourier power spectrum of intensity fluctuations ( i.e. @xmath11 ) along the velocity axis of a ppv cube .",
    "the vcs is based on the theory that relates the fluctuations of intensity in the ppv scale to the underlying fluctuations of velocity and density .",
    "the procedure that we employ is based on the fact that the @xmath11 depends on the angular resolution of the telescope beam ( see figure 1 ) . by investigating how @xmath12 changes",
    "when changing from high to low angular resolution , and by utilizing the information from intensity map ( or column density map ) we can evaluate the velocity power spectrum .    the spectral line signal that we deal with",
    "is the hi intensity measured at velocity @xmath13 and at a given beam position @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is normalized emissivity,@xmath17 denotes the convolution between the spectrometer channel sensitivity function and the temperature dependent maxwellian distribution of velocities of emitting particles .",
    "in addition , @xmath18 is a line - of - sight component of the regular galactic velocity shift , @xmath19 is the line - of - sight component of the random turbulent velocity .",
    "the window function @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an instrument beam , pointed at the direction @xmath23 , which depends on angular coordinates @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is a window function defining the extent of the observed object .",
    "the fourier transform of a spectral line is @xmath26    if we correlate @xmath27 in two directions , pointed by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we get the following measure @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes averaging and where we assumed that gas velocity and emissivity are uncorrelated .    equation [ eq4 ] gives us the emissivity correlation function : @xmath32    we provide averaging assuming that the velocity statistics are gaussian : @xmath33 we assume that the beam separation and the beam width are both small enough that we can neglect the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath34 ( we consider @xmath35-axis to be a bisector of the angle between beams ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath36 depends only on @xmath35 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 characterizes regular velocity shear .",
    "the case of velocity shear @xmath38 arising from galaxy rotation is considered in detail in lp00 .",
    "let us introduce the velocity structure function : @xmath39 then eq .  ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "can rewritten as : @xmath40    further transformations result in @xmath41 where geometric factor @xmath42 is defined @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a fourier transform of the channel sensitivity function @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to see that the measure @xmath45 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : k12 ] ) depends both on the angular distance between the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the velocity wavevector @xmath46 .",
    "if we integrate over @xmath46 we are left with the 2d power spectrum that is the basis of the vca technique . on the other hand , if we take coincident vectors @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 to obtain a one - dimensional spectrum @xmath12 , we arrive at the vcs technique that we employ in this paper .    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath23 is a beam direction .",
    "( [ eq : p1_orig ] ) has two asymptotic spectral regimes that depend on beam size ( see lp00 and cl06 ) and on whether the density spectral slope is shallower than -3 or steeper than -3 .",
    "the gist of our approach is that we do not use the asymptotic regimes but rather calculate p1 directly .",
    "first of all , we derive the window function .",
    "smc is a remote emitting structure and therefore the corresponding window function @xmath25 is non - zero only in some vicinity of a distant enough point @xmath49 .",
    "we also assume , that picture - plane extent of the object is larger than the beam size , so the @xmath50-dependence of @xmath25 can be ignored",
    ". then we obtain @xmath51 if we introduce @xmath52 window function becomes @xmath53 and the geometric factor @xmath54 is the auto - correlation of it . in our calculations we use gaussian approximation for both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "our goal is to express @xmath57 through the velocity spectrum .",
    "if we assume that @xmath58 is primarily solenoidal with power - law power spectrum having cutoff at large scales , the velocity power spectrum can be written in as follows ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the velocity power spectrum amplitude , @xmath61 is the velocity spectral index , @xmath62 is the cutoff wavevector bound with the injection scale @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the component indexes .",
    "then @xmath57 can be represented as @xmath66 where the summation over repeating indexes is assumed .",
    "we point out that eq .",
    "[ eq : fu ] contains the injection scale @xmath67 and the velocity power spectrum amplitude @xmath60 .",
    "thus the injection energy and injection scale can also be found from the vcs in addition the power spectral index .    in addition , we need to estimate the emissivity correlation function for our modeling . this part can be presented as a sum of variable and constant parts : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the emissivity power spectrum and @xmath70 is the mean emissivity . here @xmath71 is the spectrum amplitude .    for our modeling",
    "we need the value of @xmath72 . after some algebra we can derive for it the following expression : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the relative deviation plane of sky intensity , that is equal to @xmath75 for the smc intensity map within the selected region .",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 are the window function fourier transforms normalized to their values at zero wavevector .",
    "then we can evaluate the emissivity correlation function as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79 for our calculations we assume that @xmath80 is the same as in eq . [ eq : fu ] . in",
    "what follows , we use the mathematical formalism above to analyze the observational data .",
    "the two - dimensional spatial power spectrum of the hi column density image was performed by stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) .",
    "they found that @xmath81 . using a distance to the smc of 60kpc and thickness ( size ) of the smc 4kpc ( sx99 ) we apply the vcs procedure as outlined in the previous section .",
    "we first calculate the power spectrum over the velocity coordinate @xmath12 for three resolutions : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure [ fig : vcs ] .",
    "we note that our analysis is mostly biased towards the cold gas in the smc and that the spectrum measured here is generally of the cold gas , which tends to have higher sonic mach numbers than the warm hi in the smc ( burkhart et al .",
    "the fitting of the spectrum , which is overplotted in figure [ fig : vcs ] , is performed with mathematica ` findminimum ` , which implements the algorithm of steepest descent .    applying the vcs to the smc data we report the following parameters :    * @xmath85 * @xmath86 ( stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ) * @xmath87 kpc * @xmath88 km / s * @xmath89    the mach number for the cold phase @xmath90 is calculated assuming the cold phase temperature @xmath91k .",
    "we note that the @xmath12 fitting did not include the first 3 points , as they are affected by the regular motions ( see below ) .",
    "an important consideration for the analysis of velocity statistics in a galaxy such as the smc is the contribution to the turbulence power spectrum from regular motions .",
    "regular motions in the smc were studied in stanimirovic , staveley - smith & jones ( 2004 ) who found a complicated velocity field resulting from several expanding hi shells in addition to the galactic rotational velocity .",
    "let us estimate the possible impact of these motions .",
    "the velocity term of the vcs for arbitrary regular velocity is : @xmath92 comparing the arguments for the turbulent and regular velocities and accounting for the fact that the spatial dependency of @xmath93 is three - dimensional , while that of @xmath94 is one - dimensional ( due to the relatively narrow beam ) we can estimate the boundary @xmath95 which separates regular motion domination region from the region where turbulent motions dominate as follows : @xmath96 we estimate @xmath97 as the separation between large scale regular components of the average line - of - sight velocity . according to our calculations , @xmath98 m / s and @xmath99 m / s . substituting this to the previous expression we finally have : @xmath100",
    "we note that this estimation fits well to the approximate scale at which our vcs fitting deviates from the data .",
    "the velocity power spectrum is a critical parameter of turbulence to obtain from ism observations as it gives true dynamical insight into the process of turbulence .",
    "this is not the first time the velocity power spectrum has been estimated for the smc galaxy as stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) used vca to recover the velocity slope . while our estimate for the density spectrum in this paper agrees",
    "well with the value obtained using the vca technique in stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) our estimate of the velocity spectrum is substantially different .",
    "indeed , stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) found the three - dimensional velocity power spectral slope to be -3.4 , which , in fact , is an unusual value for mhd turbulence ( see brandenburg & lazarian 2013 for a review ) . in contrast , we find a much steeper slope for the velocity power spectrum of -3.85 .",
    "this slope is predicted from numerical simulations of high mach number turbulence ( e.g. kritsuk 2007 ; kowal & lazarian 2010 ; collins et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as the sonic mach number analysis of the smc done in burkhart et al .",
    "the steep velocity slope in a compressible medium also harkens to the predictions of a steep velocity slope given in the burgers shock dominated turbulence model .",
    "we believe that fitting of integral expressions that we employed here provides a more accurate approach compared to the asymptotic approach applied in stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of fluctuations is limited by the resolution of the data and , given the limits of sensitivity , the uncertainty of the spectral index evaluation may be substantial .",
    "for instance , if we consider measuring the slope of the spectra of 2d channel maps within vca , we should be aware for a given channel thickness the slices may show `` thick '' slice asymptotics for smallest eddies , while for large eddies the slices will exhibit `` thin '' asymptotics .",
    "thus the spectrum at small wavenumber may have a spectral slope which differs from that of large wavenumbers and fitting a single power law may be misleading .",
    "a possible approach to dealing with this issue is choosing the channel thickness of the order of the thermal line width .",
    "this however may require much higher signal - to - noise data . as a result ,",
    "a similar procedure of fitting the spectra by using integral expressions and varying the thickness of the channel maps may be useful for the vca practical analysis of the data .",
    "we believe that this should reconcile the data of the vca with our results .",
    "nevertheless , we want to point out that the compressible and incompressible components of velocity field contribute differently into the measures available to the vca and vcs .",
    "this may be another reason for the disagreement that we face .",
    "the issue requires further studies .    what drives the turbulence in the smc ?",
    "the fitted value of the 2.3 kpc injection scale suggests two dominate possibilities .",
    "one possibility is that turbulence is stirred by a large number of expanding hi shells found in the smc .",
    "the shell sizes range from @xmath130 pc to @xmath12 kpc .",
    "hence , one scenario could be that the largest shells drive the turbulent cascade down to the smallest observed scales or that the shells fragment and drive instabilities .",
    "turbulence may also be driven in the smc by the last smc - lmc encounter .",
    "this would agree with the predictions made by simulations presented in besla et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and also with the analysis of goldman ( 2000 ) .",
    "we did not find evidence for a dissipation scale present in the hi data however the scales resolved in our data only proceed down to 30pc and thus the dissipation scale in the smc may be smaller than this scale .",
    "this agrees with the line width size relation of the smc , which as been observed down to scales smaller than 30pc ( rubio , lequeux & boulanger 1993 ) .    in light of the vcs analysis",
    "we can estimate the energy density of turbulence in the smc . given a turbulent velocity at the injection scale of v@xmath101=6700 m / s and an average ambient hi density of 0.3 - 1.9 atoms/@xmath102 ( sx99 ) , then the energy density of turbulence in the smc would range between @xmath103 ev/@xmath104 , as compared to @xmath105ev/@xmath104 for the milky way . as a comparison",
    ", the energy density in cosmic ray electrons in the smc has been estimated by the fermi telescope to be @xmath106=0.0036 ev/@xmath104 , which is about 60% of the local cosmic ray energy density in the milky way ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the energy density in the cosmic ray protons is estimated to be @xmath107=0.15 ev/@xmath104 ( abdo et al .",
    "mao et al .",
    "2008 estimated a total 3d field strength in the smc ( assuming equipartition with cosmic rays ) of 1.7@xmath108 which suggests a magnetic energy density of @xmath10.12@xmath1090.06 ev/@xmath104 .",
    "the milky way appears to have an equipartition of energy between turbulence , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays with each component carrying about 1 ev/@xmath102 .",
    "the smc is a dwarf galaxy ( with dynamical mass of 2.4@xmath110 m@xmath111 ) and thus it is unsurprising that the overall energy density in turbulence , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays , is significantly less .    the vcs technique , which as been numerically tested in chepurnov et al .",
    "2009 , has a bright future ahead in terms of measuring the properties of turbulence in a number of interesting environments .",
    "the technique thus far has been applied primarily in the context of 21 cm data but there is no reason not to apply it to the wealth of molecular line tracers such as co as was done in padoan et al .",
    "accurate measurements of the turbulence energy budget of molecular clouds and the sonic mach number will have important consequences for theories of star formation ( i.e. see krumholz & mckee 2005 ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ; hennebelle & chabrier 2008 ; federrath & klessen 2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "the vcs does not need to be limited to ism or galaxy studies but also can be applied to spectral lines as measured in galactic halo environments or galaxy clusters using absorption lines or x - ray emission lines with high enough spectral resolution .",
    "our results in this paper are in agreement with the study of mach numbers of turbulence in smc in burkhart et al .",
    "this illustrates well the synergy of using different techniques to investigate the parameters of turbulence .",
    "a new technique of studying turbulence spectra of magnetic fluctuations using synchrotron polarization fluctuations was recently developed in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2015 ) .",
    "this technique makes use of a statistical description of synchrotron statistics and applicable to describing fluctuations for arbitrary spectral index of cosmic rays",
    ". it will be advantageous to study and compare the statistics of velocity and magnetic field in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of turbulence in smc and other galaxies .",
    "we apply the velocity coordinate spectrum technique to obtain the velocity power spectrum in the smc galaxies in 21 cm emission .",
    "we find a steep power spectral slope for velocity which is in agreement with the expectations for supersonic turbulence .",

    "<S> we present the results of the velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) technique to calculate the velocity power spectrum of turbulence in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) in 21 cm emission . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a velocity spectral index of -3.85 and an injection scale of 2.3 kpc . the spectral index is steeper than the kolmogorov index which is expected for shock - dominated turbulence which is in agreement with past works on the smc gas dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the injection scale of 2.3 kpc suggests that tidal interactions with the large magellanic cloud are the dominate driver of turbulence in this dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this implies turbulence maybe driven by multiple mechanisms in galaxies in addition to supernova injection and that galaxy - galaxy interactions may play an important role . </S>"
