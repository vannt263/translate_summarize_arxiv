    "a quantitative picture of the medium created in high - energy pb - pb collisions can be obtained by measuring its properties with observables that give access to the energy - loss mechanism for different parton species and to the transport properties of the medium .",
    "theoretical models of energy loss predict a hierarchical dependence on the colour charge and mass of the parton propagating through the medium .",
    "a larger energy loss is expected for gluons , together with a suppression of gluon radiation at small angles for partons with larger mass (  dead - cone \" effect  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare medium effects ( i.e. the path - length , colour - charge and mass dependence of the energy loss , as well as the collective motion ) on heavy quarks versus light quarks and gluons .",
    "such challenging goals require precise heavy - flavour measurements in pb - pb collisions and a clear understanding of the reference systems provided by pp and p - pb collisions .",
    "the latter provides the control experiment needed to disentangle effects from the cold matter in absence of a hot and dense medium .",
    "the alice  @xcite detectors used in these analyses are the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the time of flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "they provide tracking , primary and secondary vertex reconstruction and particle identification , like @xmath6 separation up to transverse momentum @xmath7 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "these features are essential ingredients to perform open - heavy flavour analyses over a broad transverse momentum range .",
    "in addition , the vzero detector is used for triggering on collisions and for centrality measurements .",
    "charmed mesons are reconstructed in alice through their hadronic decays : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis strategy exploits the particle identification and the detector capability to reconstruct secondary vertices displaced by a few hundred @xmath12 m from the primary vertex .",
    "topological cuts are applied on the reconstructed secondary vertices and the signals are extracted via fits to the invariant mass distributions . in these proceedings",
    "we report on the prompt @xmath1-meson nuclear modification factor @xmath0 , defined as the yield in pb - pb collisions divided by the cross - section in pp collisions scaled by the average nuclear overlap function in a given pb - pb centrality range , as a function of @xmath13 and collision centrality .",
    "the prompt @xmath1-meson elliptic flow @xmath3 , defined as the second harmonic coefficient of the fourier azimuthal expansion , is also reported as a function of @xmath13 in semi - peripheral collisions .    in the @xmath0 analysis , the prompt @xmath1-meson yield was obtained after subtracting the contribution of @xmath1 mesons from beauty hadron decays based on perturbative qcd calculations ( fonll ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 of non - prompt @xmath1 mesons was assumed to be @xmath14(on the basis of the cms results of non - prompt @xmath15 , instead of @xmath16 as done in the previous analysis  @xcite ) and the systematic uncertainty was assessed by varying its value between 1 and 3 times the prompt-@xmath1 r@xmath17 . due to the lack of statistics of the pp data at @xmath18 tev , the pp reference needed for the r@xmath17 analysis was determined by scaling the @xmath1-meson cross section measured at @xmath19 tev to @xmath18 tev using fonll calculations  @xcite .",
    "the scaling uncertainty varies from @xmath20 to @xmath21 from low to high @xmath13 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath1 mesons from beauty decays was also subtracted from the @xmath3 measurement with an assumption on the @xmath0 ( as above ) and @xmath3 of non - prompt @xmath1 mesons ( @xmath22  @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses were performed on the data from the pb - pb runs at @xmath23 tev collected in 2010 ( minimum bias trigger , @xmath24b@xmath25 ) and 2011 ( @xmath26 and @xmath27b@xmath25 for 0 - 7.5% and 10 - 50% respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath0 of prompt @xmath1 mesons was measured with alice in the @xmath28 centrality class using the data sample collected in 2011 , which extends the measurements to a wider transverse momentum range ( @xmath29 gev/@xmath5 ) compared to the published results from the 2010 data  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] ( left ) , the @xmath0 values for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 agree within the uncertainties and show a strong suppression ( factor of @xmath33 for @xmath34 gev/@xmath5 ) of the @xmath1-meson yields in pb - pb collisions relative to pp collisions . the first measurement of the @xmath35 meson in pb - pb collisions is also shown .",
    "a suppression of the @xmath35 is observed for @xmath36 gev/@xmath5 , in agreement within the uncertainties with the non - strange charmed mesons @xmath0 in this @xmath13 range .",
    "the @xmath35-meson yield could be less suppressed at lower @xmath13 because of the predicted c - quark recombination with the enhanced strange quarks in the medium  @xcite , however a more precise measurement is needed to draw a conclusion .",
    "the @xmath0 as a function of the number of participant nucleons weighted by the number of binary collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] ( right ) for @xmath30 mesons with @xmath37  gev/@xmath5 and compared to pions measured in the same centrality and @xmath13 intervals .",
    "the main correlated systematic uncertainties for the @xmath1-meson yields come from the pp cross section and beauty feed down .",
    "the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are mainly due to the @xmath1-meson yield extraction and cut variation .",
    "the suppression of @xmath1 mesons with @xmath37 gev/@xmath5 is almost independent of centrality , while the pion @xmath0 decreases with increasing centrality .",
    "the magnitude of the suppression is similar for @xmath1 mesons and pions .",
    "a hint of a difference in central collisions is suggested but a larger dataset is needed to draw conclusion on the expected difference between @xmath1 mesons and pion suppression due to the mass and colour charge dependence of the energy loss . in the higher @xmath13 range the @xmath1-meson suppression is no longer flat , rather it increases from peripheral to central collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : raab ] , left ) .",
    "the @xmath0 of non - prompt j/@xmath2 ( @xmath38 gev/@xmath5 and @xmath39 ) measured with cms is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : raab ] ( left ) as a function of the number of participants weighted by the number of binary collisions  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown together with the @xmath1-meson @xmath0 from alice ( @xmath40 gev/@xmath5 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the selected @xmath13 ranges correspond to similar kinematical ranges for the parent b and c quarks , but the measurements are performed in different rapidity ranges .",
    "an indication of a difference in the suppression of charm and beauty can be observed in central collisions , consistent with the mass hierarchy expected from various energy - loss models , such as those reported in the figure  @xcite .",
    "while the model  @xcite based on collisional and radiative energy loss in an anisotropic medium agrees with both prompt @xmath1 mesons and non - prompt j/@xmath2 , the others seem to underestimate both ( i.e.  @xcite , based on collisional energy loss in an expanding medium ) or to underestimate the suppression of non - prompt j/@xmath2 ( i.e.  @xcite , based on radiative energy loss and @xmath1-meson in - medium formation and dissociation ) .",
    "the @xmath3 for prompt @xmath1 mesons , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : raab ] ( right ) , was measured as a function of @xmath13 in the range @xmath42 gev/@xmath5 in the 30 - 50% centrality class  @xcite .",
    "we observe a positive @xmath3 for prompt @xmath1 mesons in the transverse momentum range @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 , which is comparable to that of charged particles ( not shown ) .",
    "this result suggests a collective motion also for heavy quarks at low @xmath13 . at higher momentum a positive @xmath3",
    "is expected due to the path - length dependence of the in - medium energy loss , given the different paths traveled by a parton propagating through the medium .",
    "the measurements of the prompt @xmath1-meson @xmath3 are also compared to various energy - loss models  @xcite .",
    "while several theoretical models based on in - medium parton energy loss reproduce reasonably well the @xmath0 of prompt @xmath1 mesons as a function of @xmath13 ( not shown , see  @xcite ) , they are challenged by simultaneously reproducing results from prompt @xmath1-meson @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the suppression of prompt @xmath1 mesons observed in the momentum range @xmath43 gev/@xmath5 in central pb - pb collisions at @xmath44 tev is evidence for a strong modification of charm production in pb - pb compared to pp collisions due to energy loss .",
    "results for the @xmath35 meson also show a suppression in @xmath36 gev/@xmath5 but suffer from statistics limitations that do not allow us to draw conclusions on a possible enhancement at low @xmath13 due to a coalescence of charm quarks with strange quarks .",
    "the measurements of prompt @xmath1-meson @xmath0 as a function of centrality indicate that the suppression tends to be constant with centrality in the lowest @xmath13 range , @xmath37 gev/@xmath5 , while it increases with centrality at intermediate / high @xmath13 .",
    "the observed difference in the suppression of @xmath1 mesons and non - prompt j/@xmath2 from b - meson decays at high @xmath13 in central collisions suggests a mass dependence in the energy loss of heavy quarks .",
    "the positive @xmath3 for prompt @xmath1 mesons in the momentum range @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 in semi - peripheral pb - pb collisions suggests that the interactions with the medium constituents transfer to charm quarks information on the azimuthal anisotropy of the system .",
    "theoretical models of in - medium energy loss reproduce reasonably well the measured prompt @xmath1-meson @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , a simultaneous description of both @xmath0 and @xmath3 remains a challenge for models , indicating that the energy - loss mechanisms and the participation of heavy quarks in the collective behavior of the quark - gluon plasma are not yet fully understood today .",
