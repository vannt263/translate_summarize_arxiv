    "dark - matter haloes provide the gravitational potential wells in which galaxies form , and as such , the understanding of their assembly process during the cosmological history is a key element in the theory of galaxy formation .",
    "focusing on gravitational physics while avoiding the complications associated with baryonic physics , the study of the growth of dark - matter haloes is the straightforward , more solid part of the theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the process of bottom - up assembly of dark haloes is described successfully by an approximate formalism , the extended press - schechter ( eps ) or excursion - set model , which combines the statistics of an initial gaussian random fluctuation field with the gravitational instability theory of linear fluctuation growth and with the non - linear spherical collapse model @xcite . in the simplest version of this model , the assembly history of a halo",
    "is predicted to be fully determined by its mass , independently of its environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more sophisticated versions of eps do involve a certain environment dependence , but they do not recover the correlation seen in the simulations @xcite .",
    "the mere mass dependence , motivated by the simplest eps model , lies at the basis of the widely used scheme for galaxy clustering that utilises the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation revealed that the halo assembly history does depend on the density of haloes in its environment @xcite .",
    "for example , when the halo history is parameterised by a formation redshift @xmath2 corresponding to the time by which the halo had assembled one half of its current mass , haloes that formed earlier are found to be more strongly clustered and , equivalently , reside in denser environments .",
    "this effect is valid for haloes that are much smaller than the current characteristic gravitationally collapsing mass - scale @xmath3 ( @xmath4 at redshift zero ) and reverses for haloes above @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of this and related deviations from the predictions of eps , sometimes termed  assembly bias \" @xcite , is not obvious  it poses a very interesting open theoretical question which deserves a simple understanding .",
    "there have been several attempts to understand the assembly bias .",
    "@xcite noted that the assembly bias can be incorporated in an excursion - set scenario where the spherical collapse model is replaced by ellipsoidal collapse and the density threshold for halo collapse depends on the shape and size of the local environment . despite recovering some environment dependence ,",
    "the effect found by these authors is too weak to explain the @xmath0-body results .",
    "however , @xcite considered only the tidal field generated by the linear ( gaussian ) density perturbations , as derived by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations indicate that at late times and small scales , the distributions of tidal field eigenvalues depart significantly from those for a gaussian random field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "environmental effects in the ellipsoidal collapse model have also been discussed by @xcite but the model investigated by this author could not reproduce the correct sign of the assembly bias at low masses .",
    "@xcite found that small old haloes tend to reside next to very massive haloes .",
    "considering the relative velocity of the dark - matter flow surrounding the haloes , they observed that particles surrounding the haloes with highest @xmath2 have large relative velocities .",
    "most recently , @xcite showed that the assembly bias at high masses follows naturally from the statistics of peaks of gaussian random fluctuations when accounting also for the peak curvature . at low masses ,",
    "these authors find a systematic trend of halo age with the velocity dispersion of the environment .",
    "both , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the accretion onto a halo is suppressed because environmental velocities exceed the halo s virial velocity .",
    "a possible scenario leading to these high velocities is that the dark - matter fluid is `` hotter '' in regions of higher density ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after shell - crossing during the formation of the host large - scale structure .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with other findings that the dark - matter flow in dense filaments is rather  cold \" ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite argue that the mass of the large - scale environment in which the low - mass haloes form is not large enough to account for this explanation .",
    "furthermore , the measures employed by @xcite and @xcite are not sensitive to distinguish between various scenarios : `` hot '' flows , haloes that move against the flow of their environment on `` unorthodox '' orbits @xcite and strongly sheared flows .    in this article",
    ", we address the hypothesis that the early formation times of haloes of a given mass much below the non - linear mass in dense environments are primarily driven by the _ tidal _ suppression of the halo growth rate in the vicinity of a neighbouring massive halo .",
    "small , typical ( low - sigma ) haloes tend to form in filaments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and stream along them into more massive , rare ( high - sigma ) haloes .",
    "the tidal field in these regions is likely to generate an ordered shear flow and thus suppress the halo growth by accretion or mergers .",
    "this suppression is expected to be correlated with the proximity to the massive halo .",
    "those small haloes that have already passed through the inner regions of bigger haloes are likely to have lost mass due to tidal stripping @xcite and thus show the earliest formation times .    in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we quantify in several different ways the halo assembly history and its environment , and study the correlations between the adopted quantities .",
    "the traditional parameterisation of assembly history via the formation epoch @xmath2 is complemented with more direct measures of halo growth rate at different redshifts .",
    "the environment , commonly referred to by the halo number density or the amplitude of the two - point correlation function , is characterised instead by the tidal / shear field , via the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor .",
    "the correlations between assembly history and environment are shown graphically and measured via correlation coefficients .",
    "the primary role of the tidal field over the density field is to be addressed by the relative strength of the corresponding correlations with the assembly history .",

    "results are shown for the three simulations of different resolution described in the text .",
    "dotted lines show exponential fits to the data points.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure [ fig : massloss_fraction ] we show in grey the fraction of well resolved haloes in our simulations that are found as isolated haloes at @xmath26 and lost at least 3 per cent of their particles to a more massive halo ( note that this definition entails haloes that are actually detected as subhaloes at @xmath33 ) . at a given mass ,",
    "this fraction is on the order of a few per cent .",
    "the fraction is higher for smaller halo masses and reaches a value of @xmath142 per cent for @xmath143 .",
    "however , these haloes do not represent the entire population of haloes that underwent mass - loss in an encounter with a more massive halo .",
    "first , the time resolution of our saved simulation snapshots does not permit to detect all haloes that were at some point subhaloes of another halo , and second , it is not guaranteed that the tidally unbound mass will be part of the more massive halo after stripping . in order to get an upper limit on their abundance",
    ", we consider now all those haloes for which the hill radius is smaller than the virial radius at some point during their evolution and that are thus prone to tidal mass - loss .",
    "the fraction of haloes fulfilling this criterion is on the order of 20 per cent at the lowest masses we considered ( see figure [ fig : massloss_fraction ] , black line and symbols ) in agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite . the lower number of those haloes for which actual mass - loss is detected implies that the tidally unbound mass typically does not end up in the bigger halo . in figure",
    "[ fig : harker_massloss ] ( left panel ) we showed how the correlation of formation redshift with overdensity @xmath44 changes when the haloes that lost mass due to an encounter with a more massive object are removed from the sample .",
    "the rank correlation decreases from @xmath144 for the entire sample to @xmath145 after exclusion of the stripped subset . removing also the larger sample of those haloes that had @xmath141 during their evolution results in a slight increase of the correlation coefficient to @xmath146 ( all numbers are slightly higher when using @xmath119 instead of @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the criterion @xmath141 is roughly equivalent to selecting those haloes that were within @xmath147 virial radii of another halo .",
    "our results thus suggest that tidally stripped haloes are only the most extreme cases of tidally truncated mass assembly .",
    "furthermore , haloes that are at the apocenter of their orbit after passing through a massive halo are also likely to have very large relative velocities with respect to their environment . considering the relative velocity between a halo and the surrounding region within @xmath128 and @xmath148 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : shearflow ] ) , we find that haloes identified as stripped haloes indeed show large relative velocities .",
    "these relative velocities will lead to extreme velocity dispersions around haloes and are possibly dominating the results of @xcite ( their figure 8 , where median relative velocities are much larger than the halo virial velocity only in the tail of the formation redshift distribution ) . when removing the stripped haloes",
    ", we find that the correlation between relative velocity and formation redshift weakens substantially .",
    "the formation redshift of dark - matter haloes is highest for haloes that have the lowest assembly rate at late times ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : assembly_rate ] ) . tying this suppression of late growth to a physical effect that is most effective in dense / strongly clustered regions can thus potentially explain the correlation of halo clustering and formation redshift , the so - called `` assembly bias '' .",
    "tidal forces induce a sheared flow in the vicinity of small haloes that flow along filaments of the cosmic web ( section [ sec : proximity ] ) . to quantify this effect , we measured the local influence of the larger scale tidal field by considering the rate - of - strain tensor of the flow in the immediate vicinity of haloes .",
    "we found that the progenitors of haloes of a given mass at @xmath26 that have the lowest mass assembly rates experience significantly stronger shear during their assembly history than those haloes with high mass assembly rates .",
    "tidal effects are expected to be strongest close to massive haloes .",
    "whenever a mass @xmath149 at distance @xmath48 from a smaller halo completely dominates the potential , the tide in the direction of this mass is given by @xmath150 , while the perpendicular tides are given by @xmath151 . in the rest - frame of the smaller halo , matter is receding along the direction to the massive halo .",
    "furthermore , upon approaching the massive halo , the environment density will grow substantially and as a consequence the correlation between density and shear grows with time ( see section [ sec : tidalassembly ] ) . since the abundance of small haloes is enhanced near massive haloes , the population of tidally suppressed haloes will be biased such that a dependence of formation redshift on clustering amplitude and environment density arises as a secondary effect .",
    "the more fundamental character of tides is reflected in the stronger correlation of measures of halo growth with @xmath114 than with environment density ( section [ sec : tidalassembly ] ) .",
    "the tidal influence of a larger halo on the accretion properties of neighbouring smaller haloes can be readily understood from the restricted three - body - problem .",
    "stable orbits around the smaller halo exist only within its hill sphere ( see section [ sec : rhill ] ) .",
    "a halo can only accrete particles ( and other smaller haloes ) in the presence of a massive halo if they are contained in the hill sphere .",
    "the radius of the hill sphere shrinks linearly with the distance to the massive neighbour so that the amount of matter available for accretion is becoming increasingly smaller .",
    "in addition , a halo is prone to mass loss when the hill radius becomes smaller than its virial radius . as shown in section [ sec : sim_stripping ] , this happens roughly at a distance of @xmath147 virial radii of the larger halo .    in the most extreme cases",
    ", small haloes can undergo very strong tidal mass - loss when passing through the massive halo",
    ". a minor fraction of haloes of a given mass are indeed not typical isolated haloes since they are once again found outside the virial radius of a massive halo after their first pericenter passage through its potential well .",
    "these haloes have also been observed in resimulations of single massive haloes @xcite .",
    "while tidal mass - loss inside the virial radius of another halo is the most violent and non - linear example , tidal suppression of halo growth seems to be already present in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "@xcite recover the assembly bias also using the punctuated zeldovich approximation where the mass of haloes grows monotonously by definition and tidal mass - loss is thus impossible .",
    "we explore the link between assembly bias and the initial linear density field in appendix [ sec : initial ] where we compare the masses of haloes measured from the simulations with the masses they should reach in an isolated environment according to the eps model .",
    "our results indicate that the eps predicted masses are roughly a factor of 2 - 3 higher for the oldest haloes than for the youngest .",
    "furthermore , we find a significant correlation between this mismatch and both the strength of the shear and large scale density at @xmath26 in the simulation .",
    "this provides further evidence that indeed the environment , that is not considered when determining the eps - like masses , prevents the mass to grow to the predicted value .",
    "hence , while eps would predict that the halo will assemble mass , the strong shear that eps does not account for prevents this ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if the correct final mass is known , it can be shown that the density dependence of formation redshifts can be reproduced using a simple peak - background - split model ( see appendix [ sec : initial ] ) .    a question that is opened by our analysis",
    "is whether the last major merger of small haloes occurs preferentially perpendicular to their host filament such that the mechanism we described is potentially also related to alignments between halo spins and shapes and the surrounding large - scale structure ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for small galactic dark matter haloes",
    "such strong alignments between halo shape and the direction to the nearby cluster have been found by @xcite extending out to many virial radii of the cluster and by alignments of both halo shape and spin with host filaments and sheets by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite claim observational evidence for an alignment of galaxy spins with the reconstructed tidal field . in the picture outlined in this paper",
    ", the decreased probability for mergers or accretion along the filament would preserve the spin vector alignment with the filament / sheet which is established when merging occurs preferentially perpendicular to the filament / sheet",
    ".    we focused in this paper on the role of tidal effects in the assembly of haloes in different environments .",
    "we note that other global properties of haloes , such as the substructure in them and their spin parameter , also correlate with environment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) .",
    "the possible relation between these properties and the suppression of accretion onto haloes should be explored .",
    "using a series of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations , we demonstrated that the mass assembly of haloes is influenced by tidal effects in the vicinity of massive haloes . the resulting suppression of mass growth at late times is reflected in an increase in formation redshift .",
    "the space density of small haloes near massive haloes is enhanced ( since their spatial cross - correlation is high and positive ) .",
    "thus , as a secondary effect , a tidally suppressed assembly of halo mass directly translates into biased spatial distributions of young and old haloes identified at @xmath26 : old haloes will be found more likely in regions of high density than younger haloes .",
    "the presence of tides has an important effect on the infall behaviour onto a halo . to quantify this , we measured the influence of external tides by considering the rate - of - strain tensor , and especially its largest eigenvalue @xmath114 , fitted to the flow between 1 and 4 virial radii around haloes . in detail",
    ", we found that for small haloes :    1 .",
    "high formation redshift is related to a low assembly rate at late times .",
    "thus , any spatially biased process that suppresses mass growth at late times can potentially lead to an age dependent bias of halo clustering .",
    "2 .   among all measures of environment that we considered , assembly rate at redshifts",
    "@xmath33 correlates most strongly with the largest eigenvalue @xmath114 of the rate - of - strain tensor , and especially so when measured at high redshift , @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation of assembly rate with the density of the environment is weaker .",
    "we find that haloes with a low assembly rate have suppressed infall or even outflow in the region between 1 and 4 virial radii along one direction .",
    "furthermore , we find that this direction corresponds , with little scatter , to the direction to that neighbouring halo that has the strongest tidal influence .",
    "3 .   the strain eigenvalue @xmath114 ( probing velocity shear ) is strongly correlated with the tidal field due to the neighbouring halo that exerts the strongest tides .",
    "this correlation has been verified using a restricted three - body approximation for the tidal field .",
    "thus , tidal forces induce a velocity shear in the flow around dark matter haloes and can render accretion ineffective by altering the convergence of the accretion flow onto a halo .",
    "the correlation between @xmath114 ( probing velocity shear and tides ) and density grows with time .",
    "thus , haloes in strongly sheared regions are much more strongly clustered than average and associated with high density regions onto which they fall .",
    "hence the suppression of mass growth is stronger in regions of high density .",
    "haloes can undergo mass loss due to the tidal influence of a larger halo when their hill radius becomes smaller than their virial radius .",
    "this already happens at a distance of @xmath147 virial radii of the larger halo and will be most severe inside its virial radius .",
    "roughly 20 per cent of the @xmath152 fulfill the condition for mass loss at some point of their history .",
    "these haloes are the most extreme cases of tidal suppression of assembly .",
    "the mismatch between the mass that the extended press - schechter formalism would attribute to a halo and the mass that is measured for it in the simulation correlates with formation time and with the eigenvalue @xmath114 indicating a dependence of this mismatch on tides ( this is shown in the appendix ) .    from the evidence presented above",
    ", we conclude that the tidal field due to neighbouring massive haloes exerts a shear on the flow surrounding small haloes . in the rest - frame of the small halo , this is an outward flow along the direction to the more massive halo , tidally suppressing the growth of the small halo .",
    "this is especially effective in filaments since most of the matter is located along the direction from which it is least effective for the halo to accrete .",
    "the proximity to more massive haloes , where the clustering is enhanced , leads to a spatial bias of haloes that experience strong tides , especially haloes below the non - linear mass , and thus also to a bias of the population of `` old '' and `` young '' haloes of the same mass .",
    "we conclude that this is an important factor in the emergence of the _ assembly bias_.",

    "the corresponding correlations at @xmath26 have been presented in figure [ fig : harker_massloss ] . at @xmath26 the oldest haloes cluster more strongly than the youngest ones . for the lagrangian patches , as expected , the opposite is true : the oldest ( youngest ) haloes are significantly less ( more ) clustered than the total .",
    "this indicates that , already in the linear density field , the environments surrounding the lagrangian patches of young and old haloes have different properties . in particular , we find that both young and old haloes at these masses form in initially underdense ( i.e. with a median @xmath185 ) regions .",
    "however , the lagrangian patches of young protohaloes reside ( on average ) in more underdense regions which , in a gaussian random field , are more strongly clustered . using the mean squared overdensities at the halo centres as a proxy for their clustering amplitude ( i.e. assuming a linear bias model independent of halo age for the halo density ) , @xmath186 , we find @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "on the other hand , with time , the protohaloes will collapse and flow towards denser regions thus changing their clustering properties . at @xmath26",
    "we find @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the reversal of the assembly bias is then a simple result of the evolution of the halo environmental density .",
    "older haloes have thus always resided in more overdense regions than younger haloes ."
