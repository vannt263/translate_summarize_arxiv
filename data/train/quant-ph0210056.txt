    "current research to create quantum information processors has forced a rexamination of the underlying description of these devices . in order for us to gain information about quantum systems",
    "they must be measured . whereas the standard picture of such measurements involves the  collapse of the wave function \" following von neumann s projection postulate ,",
    "such strongly measuring probes are rarely implemented in the laboratory .",
    "more typically , a continuous probe interacts with the system which is then detected as a macroscopic signal .",
    "examples include the probing of a quantum dot with a single electron transistor ( set ) @xcite and the measurement of the position of a micro - mechanical cantilever by monitoring the modulation of a reflected laser beam @xcite .",
    "the formalism of quantum mechanics provides a number of different approaches for analyzing such situations .",
    "scattering theory employs green s function input - output relations to describe the evolution of the probe asymptotically , both before and after its interaction with the system under examination .",
    "alternatively , the theory of quantum trajectories @xcite provides a dynamical description of the quantum system being measured , conditioned on the continuous information being collected via the probe .",
    "as laboratory developments give us access to the control and manipulation of quantum systems these descriptions become ever more relevant .",
    "the quantum trajectory approach has the advantage of directly tying the dynamics of the system s evolution to the measurement record .",
    "the ability to do this is essential when implementing adaptive measurement and control strategies employing feedback @xcite .",
    "the standard paradigm for continuous measurement is cavity qed .",
    "the dynamics of a cavity mode of the electromagnetic field ( perhaps coupled to an atom ) are monitored by a partially transmitting mirror @xcite .",
    "input - output scattering theory , suited specifically to the language of optical elements @xcite , is used to connect the intracavity dynamics with those of the traveling signal . in order to translate the typically discrete information of the individually transmitted photons into continuous",
    "information one considers a homodyne or heterodyne measurement , in which the signal is mixed with a macroscopic local oscillator .",
    "the result is a stochastic schrdinger equation which describes both the localization of the quantum state conditioned on the measurement and also the effect of quantum  back - action noise \" @xcite .    in many applications ,",
    "there is no confining cavity to set the interaction strength between the system under observation and the probe .",

    "@xcite modelled continuous observation of a moving cantilever monitored by the modulation of a reflected laser beam .",
    "they considered the cantilever to be a mirror , which , partnered with an imagined partially transmitting surface , formed a leaky optical cavity . under the assumption that the transmission rate of light through the fictitious mirror is much faster than the characteristic rate at which the cantilever moves , the cavity could be adiabatically eliminated from the dynamics .",
    "this led to a stochastic schrdinger equation for the continuously observed cantilever alone .",
    "the unphysical quantization volume , however , still appeared implicitly in this equation .",
    "the key parameter that characterizes the dynamics of a continuously observed system is the  measurement strength \" , which we will denote @xmath0 .",
    "it determines the rate at which information is gathered about the system and consequently sets the scale at which effects such as quantum back - action become significant . for example , bhattacharya et al.@xcite have shown that for sufficiently macroscopic systems there is a window of values for @xmath0 such that continuous observation can localize the probability distribution to a quantum trajectory that faithfully tracks the classically predicted trajectory , with minimal quantum noise .",
    "another example is the continuous measurement of ensembles of atoms , controlled through their collective interaction with a common probe , to produce nonclassical spin squeezed states @xcite .",
    "these effects depend crucially on @xmath0 and its relation to the other rates governing the system dynamics .    in this article",
    "we formulate the problem of continuous measurement by a traveling wave probe .",
    "we derive a master equation describing the situation in which the system is monitored by the probe , but the measurement result is not recorded .",
    "this allows us to to identify the important characteristic scales of the problem without reference to a particular measurement scheme .",

    "[ s : interaction ] to the fundamental problem of a two - level atom interacting with a resonant laser field .",
    "when the field is treated classically this leads to rabi flopping , but when treated quantum mechanically the laser not only manipulates the atom but also acts to continuously measure it .",
    "we determine the rate at which the measurement back - action leads to decoherence in the atomic system .",
    "this is contrasted with the evolution when the atom is coupled to a resonant electromagentic pulse with a fixed photon number @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "we explore the circumstances under which we can recover the usual jaynes - cummings solution for a two - level atom coupled to a single mode @xcite and show how the behavior for a single photon diverges from this solution . in sec .  [ s : faraday ] we consider continuous measurement of an atomic spin through the faraday rotation of an off - resonant laser field .",

    "we conclude and summarize our results in sec.[s : summary ] .",
    "classically , when considering quasimonochromatic propagating fields , it is natural to model the evolution of the system as a function of the propagation direction , @xmath2",
    ". the field at @xmath2 can then be decomposed into a complete set of orthonormal temporal modes which act locally .",
    "one might be tempted to describe the quantum fields in an analogous manner by quantizing the temporal modes at fixed position , @xmath3=\\delta ( t - t')$ ] .",

    "this approach was taken by van enk and kimble @xcite and also by gea - banacloche @xcite who considered an analogous problem to the one we address here .",
    "they studied how errors were generated in quantum logic operations due to the fact that control pulses are not truly classical and can become entangled with the atoms with which they are interacting .",
    "their analysis led to an effective single temporal mode theory .",
    "though some of their conclusions are correct , one must take great care to understand the regimes under which this formalism is applicable .",
    "consider , for example , a single photon pulse interacting with a localized two - level atom .",
    "let us suppose that the duration of the pulse is short compared to the natural lifetime of the atom in its excited state but sufficiently long to be considered quasimonochromatic and on resonance . defining creation and annihilation operators for the single temporal mode associated with this pulse",
    ", the hamiltonian , in the rotating wave approximation , appears to have the familiar jaynes - cummings form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the usual raising and lowering operators associated with the two - state atom .",
    "given the atom initially in its ground state , the solution leads to quantum rabi oscillations , @xmath9 this falsely predicts the possibility of a single photon @xmath10-pulse in free space , whereby the photon is perfectly absorbed and then remitted into the original mode .",
    "in reality once the atom has absorbed the photon it will remit into a mode consistent with its radiation pattern , _ not _ into the initial packet mode .",
    "that is , the single photon will be _ scattered_. this emission must also obey causality ; no information about the emitted photon can register on a distant detector at a space - like separated point . in the solution above , however , the atom both absorbs from and emits into a spatially delocalized photon mode in free space , violating causality .",
    "the problems with causality arise from the faulty quantization procedure outlined above .",
    "quantum fields must be defined over all space at an initial time ( more generally on an initial space - like surface ) .",
    "unitarity then ensures that _ equal - time _",
    ", not _ equal - space _ , commutation relations are preserved .",
    "nonequal - time commutation relations can not generally satisfy the canonical commutation relations , being inconsistent with poincar invariance @xcite .",
    "the exception is for free fields , or fields that behave like them ( e.g.  fields traveling through matter whose response is approximately linear , or asymptotic  in \" and  out \" fields as used in scattering theory ) .",
    "we review here a formalism appropriate for treating the quantum optics of paraxial propagating fields @xcite .",
    "consider a quasimonochromatic paraxial beam with frequency @xmath11 and wave number @xmath12 .",

    "the carrier wave plays the role of the rest mass and the slowly varying envelope plays the role of small fluctuations around the mass shell .",
    "the free field hamiltonian ( removing the carrier wave energy ) takes the form , @xmath21 whose heisenberg equation of motion gives the wave equation above .",
    "this hamiltonian is nothing but the second quantized version of the energy of a photon @xmath22 .",
    "consider an atom interacting with the field .",
    "in the electric - dipole and rotating wave approximation the interaction hamiltonian is , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dipole matrix element and @xmath25 is the atom s center of mass wave function .",
    "we take the atom to be trapped , having center of mass wave function @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "then the interaction hamiltonian becomes , @xmath27 @xmath28 being the effective area of the mode interacting with the atom .",
    "let us go to the interaction picture by including the free evolution of the atom and field in the interaction hamiltonian .",

    "( [ e : modeham ] ) describes the interaction of each longitudinal mode as it propagates past the atom(fig .",

    "assuming this time scale is much shorter than any other dynamical scale in the problem , it is appropriate to make the markov approximation , whereby one coarse grains over the time scale over which the system and reservoir retain  memory \" . to this end",
    ", we break up the @xmath2-axis into slices of size @xmath33 , each the extent of the atom wave packet ( e.g.  the rms of the probability density ) .",
    "the markov approximation will hold if the transit time of the field across the atomic packet , @xmath34 is much smaller than any time scale over which the atom changes .",
    "this is certainly an excellent approximation .",
    "since we will not consider dynamics on a time scale smaller than @xmath35 , we can approximate the set of atomic wavepackets , centered at each coarse grained slice , as a complete orthonormal set . that is",
    ", each slice is an approximate delta function",
    ". then normalization of both the atomic wave packet and mode functions combine to give    @xmath36    under this approximation the hamiltonian takes the form , @xmath37 this result has a clear interpretation .",
    "the traveling wave configuration is effectively multimode , with each member of the set being a traveling packet  mode - matched \" to the atom .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath38 depends on this mode volume .",
    "this picture is equivalent to a model of decoherence discussed by brun @xcite in which a  flying qubit \" passes over a  system qubit \" , the former acting as an irreversible reservoir ( through its continuous spatial degrees of freedom ) to carry information away from the system , thereby leading to decoherence . in our problem",
    "a given harmonic oscillator ( mode of the electromagnetic field ) flies over the qubit , becomes entangled with it , and then flies away .",
    "this too leads to decoherence , as we describe in the next section .",
    "we consider first the case of a resonant laser beam interacting with a trapped two - level atom .",
    "the state of the field is described by a tensor product of identical coherent states for each traveling mode packet ,    @xmath39    where the amplitude is given by the mean number of photons in time slice @xmath35 , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the power of the laser beam .",
    "more precisely , the state of the beam is a statistical mixture of states of the form above , averaged over the common , but unknown , phase of the complex amplitude @xmath42 , as described by van enk and fuchs @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the phase plays no role in the analysis to follow , so we choose it to be fixed with no loss of generality . in order to distinguish coherent effects from decoherence we transform by a unitary displacement of the field states to the vacuum ,    @xmath43    in this picture , @xmath44 the coherent term is classical rabi flopping at a frequency @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the beam intensity ( cgs units , as used throughout ) .",

    "when these conditions hold we may _ consistently _ ignore all initially unoccupied modes , yet still recover dynamics in agreement with the usual jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "the multimode description of the field becomes superfluous .",
    "finally , what is the measurement strength associated with probing an atom using a large photon number fock state pulse ? unlike the coherent state case , the field does not factorize into uncorrelated temporal slices .",
    "in fact , when viewed in terms of the coarse grained modes , the fock pulse in highly _ entangled_. detection of photons at the leading edge of the pulse will introduce new fluctuations in the trailing edge , which has yet to interact with the atom .",

    "the fock pulse is most naturally treated as part of the `` system '' rather than an `` environment '' which continuously carries information away from the atom .",

    "this expression was also derived by thomsen and wiseman in the context of control of atom - laser coherence @xcite .",
    "the physics of the continuous measurement under consideration here differs substantially from that of the resonant jaynes - cummings interaction studied in sec .",
    "[ s : interaction ] . here",
    "the measurement strength depends upon the power in the beam , whereas the previous result had no such dependence . for the resonant case ,",
    "@xmath0 could be explained as arising from those spontaneous photons emitted into paraxial modes .",
    "in contrast , the dependence of the qnd measurement on the laser power indicates that the measurement strength is due to the coherent redistribution of photons between the polarization modes in a manner depending on the atomic state .",
    "continuous quantum measurement , once studied only in gedanken experiments , can now be realized in laboratory applications @xcite .",
    "such applications utilize the ability to continuously gather information from a probe coupled to a quantum system .",
    "the system state then evolves under a stochastic master equation , characterized by the measurement strength . in this article",
    "we examined how one may derive the measurement strength for paraxial laser probes in free space by considering two examples .",
    "we considered first the fundamental system of an atom coupled to a laser beam .",
    "classically the atom - laser interaction leads to rabi flopping which is often used to manipulate coherent superpositions of atomic states .",
    "in particular laser control pulses can be used to implement quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically continuous measurement of the atom by the quantum laser pulse can lead to entanglement between the system and the probe , inducing errors in logic gate operation .",
    "we found that this is not a concern as the measurement strength is bounded from above by the total spontaneous emission rate and can thus be neglected for short interaction times .",
    "in fact , the measurement rate may be attributed to spontaneous emission into the paraxial modes , which will always be small compared to emission into @xmath156 steradians with the appropriate vector field .",
    "we also studied the distinction between continuous observation by a coherent beam and by a pulse with well defined photon number . in the latter case correlations between the quantum fluctuations at different points in the pulse",
    "disallow a clean separation between system and probe . instead",
    ", the entire atom - field system will coherently rabi flop if the number of photons is sufficiently large . for a single photon",
    ", however , we showed that rabi flopping can not occur in free space .",
    "such a result is essential lest a distant detector be able to instantly sense the presence of the atom .",
    "this highlights the need to treat the propagation of quantum fluctuations in a traveling wave geometry with great care to avoid contradictions with causality .",
    "another mechanism allowing for continuous measurement of an atom is the faraday rotation of an off - resonant polarized beam , induced by the atom s magnetic moment .",
    "this interaction produces a qnd measurement of the atomic spin .",
    "the measurement is due to stimulated redistribution of photons between pairs of occupied modes , in contrast to the resonant rabi interaction where measurement results from spontaneous emission .",
    "since the measurement strength is proportional to the laser intensity it can be made much larger than the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "of course spontaneous emission is not the only source of noise . in order to see the effects of quantum back - action the quantum ",
    "projection \" noise @xcite must be large compared all other noise sources , such as those due to photo - detection .",
    "this implies that an experiment in which the back - action is important must enhance the coupling constant without increasing the shot - noise , possibly through the use of an optical cavity or by maintaining a large ensemble of atoms collectively coupled to the probe .",
    "the latter approach has led to the observation of spin squeezing @xcite and ensemble entanglement @xcite .",
    "in such a situation it would be interesting to understand the effective measurement strength by the probe on any one member of the ensemble . exploring this question",
    "will require us to consider how quantum correlations are shared within a multipartite system interacting with a probe .",
    "we plan to address this question in future work .",
