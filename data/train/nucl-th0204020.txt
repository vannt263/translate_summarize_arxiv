    "mesons are color - singlet bound states of a quark and an antiquark .",

    "we have @xmath57 thus , in _ ladder truncation _ the effective interaction for the diquarks is reduced by a factor of two compared to the interaction in the meson channel . beyond ladder truncation",
    "a more complex algebraic relation persists between the meson and diquark bses  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the diquarks with the lowest mass are the scalar diquarks ( the diquark partners of the pseudoscalar mesons ) , followed by the axialvector and pseudoscalar diquarks  @xcite .",
    "the rainbow - ladder truncation is particularly suitable for the flavor octet pseudoscalar mesons and for the vector mesons , since the next - to - leading - order contributions in a quark - gluon skeleton graph expansion have a significant amount of cancellation between repulsive and attractive corrections  @xcite .",
    "however , the bse for diquarks , and also the scalar meson bse , receive large repulsive corrections from these next - to - leading - order contributions .",

    "as far as the flavor - singlet mesons are concerned , with the rainbow - ladder kernel only flavor - singlet states with `` ideal mixing '' are possible .",

    "this indicates the dependence of the diquark masses on the current quark masses and allows for a comparison with other calculations .",
