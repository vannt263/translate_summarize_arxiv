    "in @xcite , rozansky and witten discovered an interesting 3-dimensional @xmath0-model whose target space is given by a hyperkhler manifold @xmath3 ( or more generally , a holomorphic symplectic manifold , as demonstrated shortly after by kontsevich @xcite and kapranov @xcite ; see also the appendix of @xcite )  this is the famous _ rozansky - witten model_. in particular , the perturbative expansion of the partition function , as a rigorously defined combinatorial sum over feynman diagrams @xmath4 : @xmath5 gives rise to the _ rozansky - witten weight system _ , which provides a new construction of certain finite - type 3-manifold topological invariants ( that turned out to be the vassiliev invariants ) .",
    "their work immediately opened up a new research direction and has generated a lot of work by both mathematicians and physicists @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many questions concerning the rozansky - witten model remain unanswered . among them",
    "is a conjecture by rozansky and witten themselves @xcite*section 5 asserting that the hilbert space @xmath6 associated to a genus @xmath1 riemann surface @xmath7 should be given by the cohomology group @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the target compact hyperkhler manifold and @xmath9 its holomorphic tangent bundle . other important problems such as the construction of an ( extended ) topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) from the rozansky - witten model @xcite and the closely related theory of boundary conditions @xcite are also currently under intensive investigation .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to apply the pioneering work of costello @xcite to construct a quantization of the rozansky - witten model in the _ batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) formalism _ and investigate its observable theory making use of the recent foundational work of costello - gwilliam @xcite . besides providing yet another example where costello s machinery can be applied",
    ", we expect that these new techniques and structures ( in particular the structure of factorization algebra on observables ) can shed new light on the study of the rozansky - witten model . to apply costello s ( homological ) method of renormalization , we shall focus only on the perturbative aspects of the rozansky - witten model .",
    "so instead of considering the full mapping space , we are going to describe the classical theory only in a formal neighborhood of the space of constant maps , and this will be done using the geometry of holomorphic weyl bundles in section [ sec : classical_theory ] .",
    "we then study the bv quantization of our model along the lines of @xcite ; such a quantization amounts to constructing an effective action ( as a modification of the classical action functional ) compatible with the _ renormalization group ( rg ) flow _ and satisfying the _ quantum master equation ( qme ) _ ( the latter is a homological condition which essentially guarantees that the path integrals are well - defined ) .",
    "the effective action will be defined as a sum over feynman diagrams where the propagator is given by the green kernel of @xmath10 with respect to some a priori chosen riemannian metric @xmath1 on the source 3-manifold @xmath11 . in general , singularities may occur in the feynman weights ( owing to the infinite dimensional nature of the mapping space ) and one needs to add counter terms to the action to remove the singularities .    for our model ,",
    "however , we observe that the technique of configuration space developed by kontsevich @xcite and axelrod - singer @xcite in their study of perturbative chern - simons theory suffices . as a result",
    ", we can construct a perturbative quantization of our model without dealing directly with the singularities and counter terms .",
    "in particular , we shall show that the so - called _ naive quantization _ ( with certain local quantum corrections taken into account ) already satisfies the qme , and hence the quantized theory we obtain is independent of the metric we chose .",
    "the details of the quantization process are contained in section [ sec : quantization ] ( see in particular theorems  [ theorem : qme ] and [ theorem : qme2 ] .",
    "once our theory is quantized , we proceed to investigate the structure of _ factorization algebra _ among the classical and quantum observables , following the fundamental approach of costello and gwilliam developed in their recent two - volume book @xcite .",
    "both classical and quantum observables are defined as cochain complexes which are , roughly speaking , functions on fields over open subsets in a 3-manifold @xmath11 .    in this paper , we will focus on local quantum observables supported on open sets which are homeomorphic to ( open ) handle bodies @xmath12 . we show that the local quantum observables on @xmath13 do not receive any quantum corrections , and hence we have the following    [ thm : main1 ] the cohomology of local quantum observables on the handle body @xmath13 is the same as that of local classical observables , i.e. we have an isomorphism of graded vector spaces : @xmath14.\\ ] ]    a direct computation of the cohomology of local classical observables via standard techniques in algebraic topology ( see section [ subsection : classical - observables ] ) then yields the following    [ cor : main ] the cohomology of local quantum observables on the handle body @xmath13 is given by @xmath15.\\ ] ]    the details and precise statements can be found in sections [ subsection : classical - observables]-[subsection : local - quantum - observables ] ( see , in particular , theorems [ thm : local - classical - observable ] and [ thm : classical - to - quantum - observables ] ) .    as suggested in @xcite , the cohomology of local quantum observables gives an equivalent definition of the physical hilbert space @xmath6 associated to a genus @xmath1 riemann surface @xmath7 , so in a sense the above corollary verifies the conjecture of rozansky - witten we alluded to above .    on the other hand ,",
    "as pointed out by an anonymous referee , the work of ayala - francis @xcite suggests that for the 3-manifold @xmath16 , the factorization algebra structure on the cohomology of quantum observables should produce an associative algebra .",
    "corollary  [ cor : main ] and the excision axiom would then provide an algebraic way to compute the quantum observables on a closed 3-manifold . in view of this",
    ", our results might also be useful in constructing the ( fully extended ) tqft underlying the rozansky - witten model .",
    "we plan to investigate this in a future work .",
    "as explained in @xcite , a bv quantization produces a _ projective volume form _ on the space of global quantum observables , with which one can define correlation functions of quantum observables .",
    "in particular , this defines the _ partition function _ , namely , the correlation function @xmath17 of the constant functional @xmath18 , of our model .",
    "we prove that our partition function agrees with the original one computed by rozansky and witten @xcite ( so that both give rise to the rozansky - witten invariants ) :    [ thm : main2 ] the partition function of our model with domain @xmath11 and target @xmath3 coincides with the rozansky - witten partition function : @xmath19    see section [ subsection : correlation - function ] and theorem [ thm : partition - fcn - rw ] for more details .",
