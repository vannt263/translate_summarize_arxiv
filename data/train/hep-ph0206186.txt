    "recent results from @xmath4-factories at cleo , babar , belle have attracted a lot of attentions .",
    "data from these experiments provide new opportunities to further study the standard model ( sm ) and also to study physics beyond the sm .",
    "rare charmless hadronic @xmath4 decays , such as @xmath15 , are particularly interesting .",
    "these processes being rare are sensitive to new physics beyond the sm . minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is",
    "an extension of the sm emerges as one of the most promising candidates for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "mssm resolve many of the potential problem of the sm , for example the hierarchy problem , unification of @xmath16 gauge couplings , and so on @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 decays have been studied extensively within the framework of naive factorization scheme . in the last few years , qcd improved factorization method have been developed .",
    "this method incorporates elements of the naive factorization approach ( as its leading term ) and perturbative qcd corrections ( as subleading contributions ) allowing one to compute systematic radiative corrections to the naive factorization for the hadronic @xmath4 decays  @xcite .",
    "this method provides a better understanding of the strong interaction dynamics for @xmath4 decay into two light mesons . therefore results obtained using qcd improved method",
    "are expected to be more reliable compared with those obtained by using naive factorization .",
    "lot of studies have been done in this direction so far @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study implications of the recently measured @xmath0 branching ratios on susy flavor changing parameters , specially arising from the quark - squark - gluino ( @xmath17 ) interactions in the model@xcite .",
    "effects of susy interactions on various processes involving @xmath4 mesons have been studied previously@xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath17 interactions and re - analyze @xmath0 decays with several improvements .",
    "firstly we use the qcd improved factorization method to compute the two body hadronic @xmath4 decays . secondly ,",
    "we improve the quark level effective hamiltonian by including qcd running of different wilson coefficients ( wc ) from the susy scale ( @xmath18 ) to the low energy scale ( @xmath19 ) which is applicable to @xmath4 decays .",
    "previous authors while doing similar analysis have neglected this rg evolution of wc s .",
    "we find that this rg evolution of wc s have non - negligible effects on the branching ratio calculations .",
    "using the most recent experimental data from different @xmath4-factories on the @xmath20 decays we constrain the flavor changing susy parameters arising from the @xmath21 mixing due to the presence of @xmath22 interaction vertices in different one loop contributions to @xmath23 decays .",
    "similar kind of squark mixing can also occur for other flavor changing @xmath4 decays . for @xmath6 processes ,",
    "@xmath7 is usually considered to give the strongest limit on such mixing .",
    "we , however , find that in some part of the parameter space @xmath8 processes provide better bound .",
    "we also discuss the implications of @xmath9 mixing in this context .",
    "furthermore , we also study constraints on fcnc parameters obtained from @xmath10 processes @xmath11 , and @xmath24 mixing .",
    "we find that @xmath25 mixing provides the best limit in a large part of the parameter space , but in certain region of the parameter space @xmath26 can still give better constraints .",
    "in the susy , squark and gluino induce large one loop contribution to @xmath23 decay from penguin and box diagrams because they are related to strong couplings .",
    "we compute the effect of flavor changing contributions to @xmath20 arising from @xmath27 interaction vertices using the mass insertion approximation method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the basis of the quark and squark states are chosen in such a way that their couplings with gluinos are flavor diagonal .",
    "the flavor changing current arises from the non - diagonality of the squark propagators .",
    "we denote the off - diagonal terms in the squark mass matrices ( i.e. the mass terms relating squark of the same electric charge , but different flavor ) , by @xmath28 , then we expand the squark propagators as series in terms of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an average squark mass , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the generation indices .",
    "the notation @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote @xmath35 and @xmath36 mixing respectively .",
    "these two parameters signify the size of flavor changing interactions in susy through the @xmath37 interactions .",
    "at one loop level , for @xmath38 mixing ( @xmath39 type ) , the new effective hamiltonian relevant to @xmath40 decays arise from susy penguin and box diagrams with gluino - squark in the loops is given by @xmath41 here we have normalized the wc s according to the sm ones .",
    "the operator @xmath42 is the same as sm definition with @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the wc s are given by @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 when @xmath45 , respectively and @xmath49 .",
    "the definition of the functions @xmath50 can be found in ref@xcite .",
    "the above wc s are obtained at the susy scale @xmath51 .",
    "we take this scale as @xmath52 .",
    "we then evolve these wc s from this high scale down to the scale @xmath53 using the rg equation . at the lower scale , after the rg evolution",
    ", the wc s take following form : @xmath54 @xmath55 are the constant after running , depend on the choice of the initial scale , as shown in table .",

    "give better bounds .",
    "in the previous discussions , we have concentrated on constraints on @xmath83 .",
    "we now discuss constraints on @xmath82 . due to the different chirality of the new operators the total wc s , in the theoretical expressions for @xmath0 ,",

    "( rr2.eps width 6 cm ) ( rr3.eps width 6 cm )    in @xmath90 and @xmath91 cases , because of different chirality in operators , the wilson coefficient @xmath92 is separated from the sm contribution @xmath93 .",
    "one needs to replace @xmath94 in eq .",
    "18 and eq . 31 by @xmath95 .",
    "the allowed ranges are shown in figure [ rr-2 ] .",
    "we see that they are different than those shown in figures 3 and 8 .",
    "it is clear that the allowed ranges of @xmath82 are constrained to be smaller than @xmath83 .",

    "just needs to replace @xmath83 in eq .",
    "25 by @xmath82 and @xmath97 by @xmath98 . since @xmath99 ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath82 from @xmath100 are the same as in figures 6 and 9 .",
    "in this paper we studied the constraints on the susy flavor changing parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 from rare hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "we improved the calculations by two folds .",
    "firstly , all the relevant wilson coefficients are computed at @xmath51 and then evolved down to lower scale @xmath103 using renormalization group equation .",
    "secondly , we calculated the two body hadronic @xmath4 decays using qcd improved factorization method .",
    "we found that the values of the wilson coefficients do change significantly under this evolution which in turn affect the theoretical computation of @xmath4 decays .",
    "the constraints obtained are compared with radiative @xmath7 and @xmath58 decays , and @xmath104 .",
    "we found that each of the different processes discussed can provide interesting constraints on the susy flavor changing parameters within certain parameter space .",
    "for @xmath102 we found that as long as @xmath105 , @xmath106 provides the most stringent limit , however , for @xmath107 , @xmath108 give better constraints .",
    "for @xmath109 we observed @xmath72 provides a better bound , but for @xmath69 around 2.43 , the bound becomes weaker . in this region , @xmath81 and @xmath58 can give stronger constraint .",
    "before we conclude , we would like to comment on the possible theoretical uncertainties arising from different form factors , ckm elements , the hard spectator interactions and also from annihilation contributions in qcd improved factorization scheme . as we have already mentioned earlier that these hard spectator interactions and annihilation contributions in qcd improved factorization method suffer from endpoint singularities and these singularities",
    "have been treated as a phenomenological parameters inducing model dependence and additional source of numerical uncertainties .",
    "however , the exact estimations of these uncertainties are not yet known .",
    "the uncertainties in the different form factors can change the theoretical results by about @xmath110 .",
    "we think that the overall uncertainty could be around @xmath111 .",
    "so , in our theoretical calculations we have taken into account this @xmath111 uncertainty to obtain the limits . in our calculations",
    "we also fixed the sm phase @xmath112 to be @xmath113 .",
    "when susy contributions are included , the @xmath112 phase will differ from its sm value .",
    "allowing @xmath112 to vary will also change the details of the numerical results .",
    "however our main objective here was to explore all possible @xmath0 decays within the context of susy and show how in different regions of parameter space the different decay modes can constrain the fcnc parameters .",
    "the generic feature of our analysis will not change significantly by the above mentioned different uncertainties .",
    "a coherent study of different processes involving @xmath4-mesons carried out here can serve to provide detailed information about the susy fcnc parameters .",
    "we hope in future with the improved theoretical calculations and data will provide a better understanding of susy flavor changing interactions .",
