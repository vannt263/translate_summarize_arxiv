    "a bepposax observation of the field centered on the unidentified egret source  led to the discovery of a hard x - ray source , proposed to be associated with a bright ( @xmath1 ) be - star located within the @xmath2 x - ray error circle ( @xcite ) .",
    "optical spectra showed it is at a distance of 2.55 kpc , with an @xmath3 derived neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath4 @xmath5 ( in agreement with the galactic 21-cm column density toward the source ) .",
    "the x - ray photon spectrum was fitted with a power law of spectral index @xmath6 and column density @xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "the derived 210 kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the extra absorption , with respect to the value obtained through the optical data , suggests that local extra gas must be present .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the be - star association and led kaaret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to the conclusion that the system is a ( probably gamma - ray emitting ) high mass x - ray binary .",
    "a reduced x - ray error circle of @xmath0 , including the be - star , resulted from the re - analysis of the bepposax data by cusumano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but the most relevant result was the discovery of coherent pulsed emission at a period of 33.8 ms with a significance level of @xmath10 . unfortunately the available x - ray data did not allow them to derive the system orbital parameters .",
    "however , the derived x - ray luminosity ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath9 in 0.140 kev ) and magnetic field strength ( @xmath12 g ) , derived from assuming the pulsar is powered by accretion , are not typical of be / x - ray binaries ( which have higher luminosities and magnetic fields ) .    in an accretion scenario ,",
    "any radio emission is expected to be quenched within the high density environment . in a non - accretion ( rotation - powered )",
    "scenario , high - energy emission can be produced either by shock acceleration or by a magnetospheric process . in this case the source could also show variable and/or periodic radio emission .",
    "detection of radio pulses with the same period of the x - ray emission would lead to an unambiguous interpretation in this sense .    here",
    "we present the results of observations made with the vla at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and pulse searches performed using the arecibo radiotelescope at 430 mhz .",
    "the  field was observed on 2000 april 25 with the very large array in its c configuration at 1.465 and 4.86 ghz ; bandwidths were 22 and 100 mhz , respectively .",
    "a gain calibrator source ( 4c  10.20 ) was observed at each frequency switch ( six in total ) and 3c286 ( flux densities of 6.8 and 3.3 jy at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz respectively ) was used as the primary calibrator .",
    "the total net observing time was @xmath13 and @xmath14 minutes at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz respectively .",
    "all four stokes parameters were recorded .",
    "one of the 27 antennas could not be used because of technical reasons .",
    "data were processed in the miriad package .",
    "after appropriate editing and calibrating , images were formed using uniform weighting and deconvolved using clean .",
    "the synthesized beam is @xmath15 ( 1.4 ghz ) and @xmath16 ( 4.8 ghz ) .",
    "the resulting images have sensitivities of 120 and 20 @xmath17jy at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz , respectively , yielding @xmath18 detection limits of 0.6 and 0.1 mjy . in the polarisation images ( stokes q and u ) these limits are of 0.45 ( 1.4 ghz ) and 0.12 mjy ( 4.8 ghz ) .    if we adopt the 90% confidence level @xmath0 x - ray error radius circle , we have only one source detected on its border while three sources are detected within the @xmath2 x - ray error circle quoted by kaaret et al . ( 1999 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6cm - img ] ) .",
    "the 4.8 ghz positions and fluxes of these sources are given in tab .",
    "[ tab:6cm - f ] .",
    ".4.8 ghz positions and fluxes of sources within the @xmath19 x - ray error circle of . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     *  errors are @xmath20 level .",
    "coordinates are equinox 2000 .    at 1.4 ghz ,",
    "only source c is detected with a flux of @xmath21 ( @xmath20 ) mjy .",
    "assuming the flux spectrum can be described by a power law @xmath22 , we find @xmath23 between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz .",
    "we do not detect polarisation from any of these sources .",
    "we checked for time variability of source c at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz by accumulating 6 images for the 6 interleaved observations .",
    "the source is constant within 25% of its average flux .",
    "we also produced the time series of 12 other field sources with 1.4 ghz fluxes in the range 210 mjy .",
    "they all show similar flux variations , probably due to calibration and deconvolution uncertainties .",
    "no optical counterpart to source c is visible in the poss - ii survey plates at a limiting magnitude of @xmath24 ( r ) and @xmath25 ( b ) .",
    "we also carried out a search for radio pulsations at 430 mhz on 2000 january 20 using the arecibo telescope .",
    "the source was observed for 15 minutes with a 10-mhz bandwidth and a sampling time of 0.1 @xmath17s using the aoftm ( arecibo observatory fourier transform machine ) .",
    "the expected rms of these observations was 30 @xmath17jy so that a @xmath26 detection corresponds to 0.3 mjy .",
    "the periodicity search in a wide period range , covering the published 33.8 ms and its harmonics , did not result in any convincing candidates above a @xmath27 threshold .",
    "we did not detect any isolated dispersed pulses .",
    "at 4.8 ghz we detect three sources in the @xmath19 x - ray error circle quoted by kaaret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; only source c is within the reduced @xmath0 error - circle by cusumano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6cm - img ] ) .",
    "the steadiness of the flux of source a and its non - detection at 1.4 ghz , suggesting an inverted spectrum , are not expected for an isolated neutron star .",
    "while source b is too weak for any detailed analysis , we can constrain its spectral index to be flatter than @xmath28 . for source c",
    ", we estimate that the chance probability to have a 1.4 ghz radio source of flux greater than 4.7 mjy within a @xmath0 error circle is 0.65% ( @xmath29 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value would suggest a putative association but , on the other hand , it remains the only argument in favor .",
    "in fact the lack of time variability , polarisation and pulsation and the flat spectral index ( @xmath30 between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz ) , suggest an extragalctic origin .",
    "we then accept the association of  with the be - star . in this case",
    "the x - ray emission can be either accretion powered or rotation powered ( i.e. magnetospheric ) .",
    "the observed x - ray properties ( and the gamma - ray properties if one believes the association with ) do not exclude this latter hypothesis . we know that psr b1259@xmath3163 ( a be - star / neutron star system with a pulse period of 47 ms ) , shows magnetospheric pulsed ( away from periastron ) and continuum ( near periastron ) radio emission ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as variable unpulsed x - ray emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) along its @xmath32 years orbit . this emission is thought to originate in a discontinuity shock between the relativistic pulsar wind and the be - star wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "this same mechanism could account for the x - ray emission in .",
    "the lack of radio flux could be due to scattering of the photons in a high density be - star wind , implying a short orbital period .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the high value of @xmath33 .",
    "but if the radio emission is not quenched ( at our flux limits ) by the local environment , then we must find another explanation for our non - detections .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption we are dealing with a young ( @xmath34 years ) isolated rotation - powered pulsar , we then can estimate the energy loss rate , @xmath35 , from the x - ray conversion efficiency . extrapolating the flux in the 0.12.4 kev rosat band and assuming an efficiency of 0.1% ( @xcite ) , we obtain an @xmath36 erg s@xmath9 . frail & moffett ( 1993 ) found as average luminosity of young pulsars a value @xmath37 mjy kpc@xmath38 and @xmath39 mjy kpc@xmath38 .",
    "they also calculate a beaming fraction for such pulsars @xmath40 , significantly lower than the @xmath41 value of x - ray emitting pulsars . assuming a distance to the system of 4 kpc ,",
    "our observations would imply a @xmath18 luminosity limit @xmath42 mjy kpc@xmath38 and @xmath43 mjy kpc@xmath38 , then quite good . for a distance of 4 kpc",
    ", we would expect a dispersion measure to this source of @xmath44 pc @xmath45 , given the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for galactic electron density . as the dispersion smearing across one of the arecibo receiver 10-khz channels",
    "is only @xmath46 ms , our pulsed search was sensitive to the shortest period pulsars .",
    "brazier & johnston ( 1999 ) argue that many young pulsars are visible as x - ray pulsars but not as radio pulsars because they are beaming away from earth and not because they have intrinsically lower radio fluxes .",
    "looking at their fig .",
    "1 we see there are only a few radio pulsars or candidate neutron stars known with similar @xmath35 and luminosity , so it is likely that our non - detection could also be attributed to an unfavorable beaming .      if  is indeed an accretion - driven be / x - ray binary pulsar , as already noted by cusumano et al . ( 2000 ) , this would imply an unusually low magnetic field strength @xmath12 g similar to sax j1808.4@xmath313658 ( @xcite ) . given also the highly variable x - ray flux for the two systems , it would be tempting to expect some transient non - magnetospheric radio emission .",
    "our @xmath47 hours observation time is much too short to say anything in this respect . a joint x - ray /",
    "radio monitoring program would be necessary to see if any simultaneous , delayed or anti - correlated emission is present .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 1997b ) showed that there is a statistically significant anticorrelation between x - ray pulsations and radio emission , though none of the 22 x - ray pulsars observed in the centimeter band with a fairly good sensitivity has ever been convincingly detected as a synchrotron radio source ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the lack of radio emission from the be - star itself is not surprising given its distance .",
    "a survey of a sample of 13 optically and ir bright classical be - stars made from the australia telescope compact array failed to detect any star at 4.8 ghz ( @xcite ) with a @xmath48 flux level of @xmath46 mjy .",
    "we have performed sensitive radio observation of  at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz with the vla and pulsar search at 430 mhz with the arecibo telescope .",
    "we do not detect any flux at the be - star position , but a relatively strong , flat spectrum source lies within the @xmath0 x - ray error circle .",
    "its properties do not support the association with the x - ray source and no sign of pulsed emission is found at a relatively high sensitivity limit . then , assuming the system is a be / x - ray pulsar , the lack of radio emission at our flux limits does not allow us to distinguish between an accretion or rotation - powered system .",
    "however it shows that :    * the system probably has a short binary period and therefore it is quite different from psr b1259@xmath3169 ; * if periodic / flaring radio emission is present , our observation was far too short to be conclusive in this respect ; * the radio emission could be quenched by the high density be - star wind or the pulsar is beaming away from the earth ; * the system could be an accreting x - ray pulsar , though transient non - magnetospheric weak radio emission could still be present .",
    "given the variable nature of the x - ray source it is also unlikely that any accurate timing can be performed in order to check for gamma - ray emission at 33.8 ms from .",
    "however its gamma - ray spectral index and flux stability favor an isolated neutron star . until the arrival of more sensitive gamma - ray instruments such as glast",
    ", the association between the two sources will likely remain uncertain .",
    "as kaaret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and cusumano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we conclude that  is most likely a compact be - star / neutron - star x - ray binary pulsar , though with an unusually short pulse period .",
    "further x - ray observations are required both to confirm the 33.8 ms period ( and measure a spin - up / down ) and to determine the ( likely short ) binary period .",
    "after this paper was submitted we became aware of new x - ray results by kaaret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which suggest an orbital period of @xmath49 days and a large @xmath50 which is more typical of young , rotation - powered pulsars rather than of accretion - powered x - ray binaries .",
