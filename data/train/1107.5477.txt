    "the abundance ratios of chemical elements that are produced on different time scales by stars of different masses are essential probes of the history of chemical enrichment in different types of stellar populations .",
    "they tell which stars  and in which proportions  have contributed to the chemical evolution of a given system at any time .",
    "after tinsley ( 1979 ) , it has become customary to explain the trend of oxygen relative to iron as due to the different roles played by type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and type ii supernovae ( sneii ) in the chemical enrichment of galaxies ( see also greggio & renzini 1983 ; matteucci & greggio 1986 ) .",
    "this interpretation is known as the ` time - delay model ' .",
    "oxygen is produced mostly by core - collapse sne on very short time scales , of the order of a few myr to tenths of myr .",
    "the bulk of iron , instead , comes later from snia explosions , on time scales ranging from 30  myr to a hubble time .",
    "hence , the [ o / fe ] ratio in a given system is high as long as sneii dominate the interstellar medium ( ism ) pollution , then decreases to solar and subsolar values when sneia become the major contributors to the production of fe .",
    "the maximum snia rate depends on the adopted progenitor model , as well as on the assumed star formation history ( matteucci & recchi 2001 ) ; thus , the measurements of [ o / fe ] are a powerful diagnostics of the star formation history in galaxies .    of particular interest are those elements whose yields depend on the metallicity of the parent stars ; manganese ( mn ) is one of them .",
    "mcwilliam , rich & smecker - hane ( 2003 ) confronted the [ mn / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation in the galactic bulge , in the solar neighbourhood and in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) .",
    "they suggested that the mn yields from both sneia and sneii are metallicity dependent .",
    "their proposals were in agreement with extant nucleosynthesis calculations for massive stars ( e.g. arnett 1971 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) , but there was not modelling of explosive nucleosynthesis in sneia supporting their findings .",
    "shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) measured the mn abundances of a dozen individual red giant stars in the sculptor , fornax , carina and leo  i dsphs .",
    "they also conclude that snia contributions to the synthesis of mn must be metallicity dependent , with very little mn produced until [ fe / h ]  = @xmath11 .    later on , ohkubo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that , indeed , [ mn / fe ]  and [ ni / fe ]  in the ejecta of sneia depend on metallicity of snia progenitors .",
    "furthermore , cescutti et al . (",
    "2008 ) demonstrated , by means of self - consistent chemical evolution models , that the run of [ mn / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in the three independent stellar systems ",
    "the galactic bulge , the solar neighbourhood and the sgr dsph can be understood _ only in terms of a metallicity - dependent yield of mn _ from sneia .",
    "the time - delay model alone is insufficient to explain the behaviour of [ mn / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in the three systems .",
    "cescutti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) propose that the yield of mn in sneia increases with the metallicity of the progenitors , @xmath2 .",
    "this is in agreement with the tight correlation between the mn - to - cr mass ratio in the ejecta of sneia and the metallicity of the progenitor found by badenes , bravo & hughes ( 2008 ) , @xmath3  = 5.3  @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "more recently , mn abundances have been studied for the first time on a significant metallicity range in the peculiar globular cluster @xmath0centauri ( cunha et al .",
    "2010 ; pancino et al .",
    "in the metal - poor regime , cunha et al . ( 2010 ) find that the lte values of [ mn / fe ] in @xmath0cen stars overlap those of their solar neighbourhood analogues .",
    "however , at variance with the solar neighbourhood trend , [ mn / fe ] declines in more metal - rich stars ( see also pancino et al .",
    "non - lte calculations confirm the conclusion of a well distinct pattern of [ mn / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in @xmath0cen ( cunha et al .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in the metallicity range @xmath12.7  @xmath6  [ fe / h ] @xmath70.7 , all other galactic globulars have mn abundances equivalent to those of halo field stars ( sobeck et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "although historically classified as a globular cluster , @xmath0cen is possibly the naked nucleus of a small galactic satellite captured by the milky way many gyr ago ( e.g. freeman 1993 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ) . as such , it likely suffered a complex chemical enrichment history , marked by the occurrence of strong differential galactic winds ( romano et al .",
    "2007 , 2010a ) .",
    "the challenging bet is : can the low values of [ mn / fe ] observed in the more metal - rich stars of @xmath0cen be explained in the context of its peculiar evolutive history ?    in this paper , we contrast the evolution of mn in the milky way with that in @xmath0cen . the goal of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we want to add the analysis of another distinct stellar population to previous theoretical study of the evolution of mn in different environments by cescutti et al .",
    "second , we want to get better insight into the mechanisms of formation and evolution of @xmath0cen . the predictions of our models for the milky way and for @xmath0cen are compared to both lte and non - lte mn abundances in the two systems .",

    ", we briefly review the relevant observational data . in sect .  3 , we describe the adopted chemical evolution models . in sect .  4",

    "this could explain the marginal disagreement between the two data sets and lead to an artificial increase of the scatter in the data when the two data sets are plotted together ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lte ] , right panel ) .",
    "cohen ( 1981 ) and gratton ( 1982 ) also published mn abundances of @xmath0cen stars .",
    "however , their determinations do not take hyperfine splitting of spectral lines into account and are , thus , not considered here .",
    "despite the adoption of different methods and assumptions to determine the mn abundances , all the studies mentioned above conclude that mn is deficient compared to iron ( [ mn / fe ]  @xmath80.5 ) in metal - poor stars and that [ mn / fe ] increases with increasing [ fe / h ] from the halo to the thin disc populations .",
    "the stars in @xmath0cen present a trend at odds with that of their solar neighbourhood counterparts , i.e. a [ mn / fe ] ratio declining with increasing [ fe / h ] ( cunha et al . 2010 ) .",
    "notice , however , that this statement rests with the determination of mn in only two stars .    in the lte approximation ,",
    "the abundances based on mni lines could be underestimated by as much as 0.4 dex at low metallicities , with non - lte effects being less pronounced in high - metallicity stars ( bergemann & gehren 2008 ) . up to now ,",
    "non - lte mn abundances have been computed only for a few stars in the milky way ( bergemann & gehren 2008 ) and in @xmath0cen ( cunha et al .",
    "when the non - lte corrections are applied to solar neighbourhood stars , a shallower rise is found from slightly subsolar values in the halo ( [ mn / fe ]  @xmath80.1 ) to solar ratios in the thin disc .",
    "the non - lte abundance analysis of @xmath0cen stars fully confirms the odd behaviour of decreasing mn with increasing [ fe / h ] depicted by lte studies ( see discussion in cunha et al .",
    "2010 ) , but once again the result bases on the analysis of only a handful of stars .",
    "we discuss further the non - lte mn abundances in comparison to our model results in sect .",
    "the chemical evolution model for the solar neighbourhood is basically the ` two - infall model ' of chiappini , matteucci & gratton ( 1997 ) , except for the adopted stellar lifetimes , nucleosynthesis and initial mass function ( imf ; see romano et al .",
    "2005 , 2010b ) .",
    "in particular , the kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) imf is assumed instead of the scalo ( 1986 ) one .",
    "this makes the predicted present - day snia - to - snii rate ratio to agree with the observations ( romano et al .",
    "2005 , their table  4 ) and allows to better explain the evolution of deuterium in the galaxy ( romano 2010 ) .",
    "the adopted model for @xmath0cen assumes that this cluster was once located at the centre of a more massive system , that evolved in isolation before being accreted and almost totally disrupted by the interaction with the milky way . because of the shallow potential well , the chemical evolution of the original system  and of the embedded proto - cluster  turns out to be significantly affected by galactic outflows triggered by multiple sn explosions ( romano et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these outflows deprive the original system of a large fraction of its metals , thus allowing the observed na - o anticorrelation and the extreme level of he enhancement to set up in a ( minor ) fraction of the hosted stars ( romano et al .",

    "as for the adopted nucleosynthesis prescriptions , they can be found below .",

    "( 1999 ) at all metallicities .",
    "this was done because the physics  and nucleosynthesis output especially for those elements produced in the inner part of the wd  of metal - free sneia are likely to be not significantly different from those at @xmath12 0 . also ,",

    "( 2008 ) also find that the mn yield from sneia declines with decreasing metallicity .",
    "the metallicity dependence they suggest is the same as in eq .",

    "the theoretical predictions , in this and all the following figures , are normalized by the solar values of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) . here , the results of the models are compared to lte data .    it can be immediately seen that , as soon as sneia start to sensibly contribute to the chemical enrichment of the ism  @xmath131 ) in the solar neighbourhood and 0.1 gyr from the beginning of the star formation ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath132 ) in @xmath0cen . ] , the theoretical curves begin to diverge from the observed [ mn / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that the mn yields from sneia are overestimated ( see also cescutti et al .",

    "this could imply that sneia in the milky way and in @xmath0cen have different progenitors , but the paucity of mn data for @xmath0cen prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion .",
    "the extremely low mn abundance measured for a few stars in @xmath0cen is not the only chemical peculiarity of this cluster .",
    "some of its stars are , in fact , enormously enriched in helium and @xmath15-process elements , while characteristic anticorrelations exist among the abundances of particular elements , similarly to what is found in other globular clusters , but at variance with the milky way field at the same metallicities .    in order to explain the peculiar patterns observed in the chemical abundances of a significant fraction of galactic globular cluster stars , dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have suggested that the ejecta of first - generation asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars collect in a cooling flow into the cluster core , where they form a subsystem of chemically anomalous second - generation stars .",
    "though attractive , such a scenario can not provide a justification for the low mn abundances ( [ mn / fe ]  @xmath130.8 ) observed in metal - rich stars of @xmath0cen by cunha et al .",

    "this value is well above that suggested by the observations of relatively metal - rich stars in @xmath0cen .",
    "the same considerations apply to the competitive scenario proposed by decressin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , where the chemical peculiarities of second - generation stars are driven by the slow winds of rotating massive stars .",
    "alternatively , one might argue that chemically peculiar stars did not originate in the cluster itself , but were accreted from the surroundings ( see fellhauer , kroupa & evans 2006 , for a possible scenario of field stars trapping by the newborn @xmath0cen ) . in this case",
    ", they would be no longer representative of the self - enrichment history of the cluster .",

    "while it is pointless to speculate on this theoretical result until more mn data for @xmath0cen stars become available , we note that jonhson & pilachowski ( 2010 ) observe consistently elevated [ @xmath17/fe ] ratios for nearly all stars in the cluster ( their sample totals 855 giants ) and interpret this as evidence against a significant contribution to @xmath0cen s chemical enrichment from sneia .",
