    "in recent years a renewed interest in the lovelock gravity and born - infeld electrodynamics has been appeared .",
    "this is due to the fact that both of them emerge in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite . on the gravity side ,",
    "string theories in their low - energy limit give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions which involves higher curvature terms , while on the electrodynamics side the born - infeld action has been occurring with the development of superstring theory , where the dynamics of d - branes and some soliton solutions of supergravity is governed by the born - infeld action .",
    "while the lovelock gravity was proposed to have field equations with at most second order derivatives of the metric @xcite , the nonlinear electrodynamics proposed , by born and infeld , with the aim of obtaining a finite value for the self - energy of a point - like charge   @xcite .",
    "the lovelock gravity reduces to einstein gravity in four dimensions and also in the weak field limit , while the lagrangian of the born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics reduces to the maxwell lagrangian in the weak field limit",
    ". there has been considerable works on both of these theories . in lovelock gravity",
    ", there has been some attempts for understanding the role of the higher curvature terms from various points of view , especially with regard to black hole physics .",
    "for example , exact static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the second order lovelock ( gauss - bonnet ) gravity have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and of the gauss - bonnet - maxwell model in ref .",
    "the thermodynamics of the uncharged static spherically black hole solutions has been considered in @xcite , of solutions with nontrivial topology in @xcite and of charged solutions in @xcite .",
    "all of these known solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity are static .",
    "not long ago one of us introduced two new classes of rotating solutions of second order lovelock gravity and investigated their thermodynamics @xcite , made the first attempt for finding exact static solutions in third order lovelock gravity with the quartic terms @xcite , and presented the charged rotating black brane solutions of third order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , the taub - nut / bolt solutions of gauss - bonnet and gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity have been constructed @xcite . the first aim to relate the nonlinear electrodynamics and",
    "gravity has been done by hoffmann @xcite .",
    "he obtained a solution of the einstein equations for a point - like born - infeld charge , which is devoid of the divergence of the metric at the origin that characterizes the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "however , a conical singularity remained there , as it was later objected by einstein and rosen .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions in einstein - born - infeld ( ebi ) gravity with or without a cosmological constant have been considered by many authors @xcite .",
    "recently , the rotating black brane solutions of einstein - born - infeld gravity have been constructed , and their thermodynamics has been investigated.@xcite .",
    "considering the analogy between the gauss - bonnet and the born - infeld terms , which are on similar footing with regard to string corrections on the gravity side and electrodynamic side , respectively , it is plausible to include both these corrections simultaneously . indeed ,",
    "if one is to consider the maxwell fields coupled to a gravitational action , which also includes string generated corrections at higher orders , then , it is naturally important to consider string generated corrections to the electromagnetic field action as well .",
    "such corrections come from a coupling of abelian gauge fields to open bosonic or open superstrings . to be precise , it is known that , just like the gauss - bonnet terms , there are born - infeld terms which appear as higher order corrections to the maxwell action  @xcite .",
    "the static black hole solutions of gauss - bonnet - born - infeld ( gbbi ) gravity have been constructed in ref . @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to construct the rotating black brane solutions of gbbi gravity and investigate their properties",
    ". we also perform a stability analysis and investigate the effects of nonlinear bi field on the stability of the solutions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we write down the first three term of lovelock gravity ( gauss - bonnet ) in @xmath1-dimensions with born - infeld type corrections of maxwell equations . in section",
    "iii , we consider a new class of rotating black brane and solve it for gravitation and electromagnetic field equations .",
    "we further discuss their thermodynamic properties in section iv .",

    "we finish our paper with concluding remarks in section iv .",

    "( [ lov2 ] ) , @xmath9 is the generalized totally anti - symmetric kronecker delta and @xmath10 is the riemann tensor .",

    "consequently only terms for which @xmath15 contribute to the field equations . here",
    "we study gauss - bonnet gravity , that is first three terms of lovelock gravity . in this case",
    "the action of gbbi gravity is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cosmological constant , @xmath18 is the gauss - bonnet coefficient with dimension @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22  are the ricci scalar and ricci and riemann tensors of the manifold @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the lagrangian of born - infeld @xmath25 in eq .",

    "thus , the gauss - bonnet gravity is a special case of higher derivative gravity .    in general",
    "the action @xmath45 , is divergent when evaluated on the solutions , as is the hamiltonian and other associated conserved quantities .",
    "a systematic method of dealing with this divergence in einstein gravity is through the use of the counterterms method inspired by the anti - de sitter conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this conjecture , which relates the low energy limit of string theory in asymptotically anti de - sitter spacetime and the quantum field theory living on the boundary of it , have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "this equivalence between the two formulations means that , at least in principle , one can obtain complete information on one side of the duality by performing computation on the other side .",
    "a dictionary translating between different quantities in the bulk gravity theory and their counterparts on the boundary has emerged , including the partition functions of both theories .",
    "this conjecture is now a fundamental concept that furnishes a means for calculating the action and conserved quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the case of black holes with constant negative or zero curvature horizons @xcite and rotating higher genus black branes @xcite .",
    "although the ads / cft correspondence applies for the case of a specially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "all of the work mention in the last paragraph was limited to einstein gravity .",
    "although the counterterms in lovelock gravity should be a scalar constructed from riemann tensor as in the case of einstein gravity , they are not known for the case of lovelock gravity till now .",
    "but , for the solutions with flat boundary , @xmath46 , there exists only one boundary counterterm @xmath47 where @xmath48  is a scale length factor that depends on @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that must reduce to @xmath49 as @xmath18 goes to zero .",
    "one may note that this counterterm has exactly the same form as the counterterm in einstein gravity for a spacetime with zero curvature boundary in which @xmath49 is replaced by @xmath48 .",

    "<S> considering both the gauss - bonnet and the born - infeld terms , which are on similar footing with regard to string corrections on the gravity side and electrodynamic side , we present a new class of rotating solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity with @xmath0 rotation parameters in the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions , which are asymptotically anti - de sitter in the presence of cosmological constant , may be interpreted as black brane solutions with inner and outer event horizons , an extreme black brane or naked singularity provided the metric parameters are chosen suitably . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the finite action and conserved quantities of the solutions by using the counterterm method , and find that these quantities do not depend on the gauss - bonnet parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the temperature , the angular velocities , the electric charge and the electric potential . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the entropy of the black brane through the use of gibbs - duhem relation and show that it obeys the area law of entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a smarr - type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy , the angular momenta and the charge , and show that the conserved and thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform a stability analysis in both the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble and show that the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field has no effect on the stability of the black branes , and they are stable in the whole phase space . </S>"
