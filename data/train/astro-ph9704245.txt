    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) with frequencies @xmath3hz have recently been observed in power spectra of countrate modulations in @xmath010 x - ray binaries .",
    "these qpo have fractional root - mean square ( rms ) amplitudes of 120% , and quality factors @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the full width at half maximum of the qpo peak in the power spectrum . in six sources a pair of qpo peaks",
    "have been observed simultaneously ( 4u  0614 + 091 , 4u  172834 , sco  x-1 , gx  51 , 4u  182030 , and 4u  163653 ) , with frequencies separated by 200400hz . in 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  172834",
    "the frequency separation remains constant during excursions in qpo frequency by @xmath0200hz .",
    "qpo frequency is strongly correlated with count rate in 4u  182030 , 4u  0614 + 091 , and 4u  172834 , and with @xmath6 as inferred from the z - track in gx  51 and sco  x-1 ( van der klis 1996 ) . a 363hz oscillation seen during x - ray bursts in 4u  172834 ( strohmayer 1996 )",
    "has a frequency consistent with the difference between the pair of qpo peaks .",
    "the frequencies of these qpo may correspond to the keplerian frequency , @xmath7 , at the inner edge of the keplerian flow , which may be terminated by radiation forces , general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity , or perhaps the magnetic field of the neutron star and to the difference , or beat , frequency between @xmath7 and the spin frequency of the neutron star ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1997 ) .",
    "the oscillations seen in during some bursts , which have a frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies of the two higher - frequency qpo , suggests this interpretation . the changing difference between the frequencies of the high - frequency qpo seen in (",
    "van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ) would then require the spin frequency to beat with a varying keplerian frequency that is slightly different from the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in this source .    in the z sources",
    "gx  51 and cyg  x-2 , countrate modulations at energies above @xmath05kev lag those below @xmath05kev by 110ms in 1555hz horizontal - branch qpo ( van der klis 1987 ; vaughan 1994 ) , with the delay increasing with photon energy , and by 70ms in 6hz normal - branch qpo ( mitsuda & dotani 1989 ; vaughan 1997 ; dieters 1997 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the cross coherence between oscillations at different energies is @xmath01 , meaning that they can be related to one another by a constant linear transformation .",
    "see vaughan & nowak 1997 for an explanation of the cross coherence function , also called the coherence function , or simply coherence .",
    "no lags have so far been detected in normal - branch qpo in sco x-1 ( dieters 1997 ) . in the case of horizontal - branch oscillations , compton upscattering of low - energy photons",
    "has been suggested as one possible explanation for the lags ( wijers , van paradijs & lewin 1987 ; stollman 1987 ; bussard 1988 ) , although differences in the lag at the qpo fundamental frequency and its harmonic in gx  51 challenge this interpretation ( vaughan 1994 ) .",
    "it is also possible to interpret the lags in the context of shot noise models by postulating that individual shots `` harden '' , i.e. , become hotter , as they progress .",
    "hardening shots can be used to produce any time delay , but vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) point out that for blackbody emission , hardening shots only result in unity cross coherence if the photons are emitted in the rayleigh - jeans part of the energy spectrum , in which case they lead to no delay .",
    "we report in this paper the discovery of @xmath8  @xmath1s hard lags in kilohertz qpo and show that they are consistent with compton upscattering in a region between a few kilometers and few tens of kilometers in size , i.e. , comparable to the size of a neutron star .",
    "we have investigated time delays in the qpo between different energy channels in 4u  160852 , 4u  0614 + 091 , and 4u  163653 .",
    "these sources were chosen because each showed qpo with high fractional rms amplitude , a moderate to high count rate , a narrow peak , and a stable frequency during at least one extended interval .",
    "we also of course required spectrally - resolved data of sufficient time resolution .",
    "all observations were performed using the proportional counter array on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ) .",
    "observation times and durations , and count rates are given in table 1 , along with qpo properties ( all of which were measured by previous investigators ) .",
    "details of the qpo in these sources can be found in berger 1996 ( 4u  160852 ) , mndez 1997 ( 4u  0614 + 091 ) , and wijnands 1997 ( 4u  163653 ) .",
    "a single qpo peak was present in each observation .",
    "we were unable to investigate time lags in observations containing two qpo peaks because data with sufficient signal strength were unavailable ( see section [ results ] ) .",
    "we calculated the cross - spectra in the way described in vaughan ( 1994 ) .",

    "measurement of time delays and the cross coherence function in the presence of a counting - noise background is discussed in detail in vaughan ( 1994 ) and vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) .",
    "the crucial quantity for determining whether a meaningful estimate of the time delay between two light curves is possible is the signal to noise ratio , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fractional rms amplitude of the qpo in the 2 light curves , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the count rates , @xmath19 is the duration of the measurement , and @xmath20 is the width of the frequency interval used for the measurement .",
    "this formula assumes the background count rate is much smaller than the source count rate and that the cross coherence between the light curves is unity .",
    "the smallest time difference that can be measured is @xmath21^{-1 } \\approx n_\\sigma(2\\pi\\nu)^{-1}(s / n)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath22 is the detection significance , in standard deviations .",
    "the observation from table 1 best suited for measuring time delays is the 3 march 1996 observation of 4u  160852 , for which @xmath23 between energy channels of width @xmath02kev at energies below @xmath012kev .",
    "we divided the data containing strong @xmath24hz qpo into 5 energy channels covering the ranges 46kev , 68.2kev , 8.210.6kev , 10.616.6kev , and 16.630kev , and measured the time delay and cross coherence function between all pairs of channels .",
    "the time delays are plotted in figure 1 relative to the 46kev channel .",
    "the sign convention is such that a positive time delay indicates that the higher energy channel lags behind the lower energy channel .",
    "the 8.210.6 , 10.616.6 , and 16.630kev channels all lag the 46kev channel with @xmath25 significance .",
    "the most significant lag ( 5@xmath26 ) is between the 46kev and 10.616.6kev channel : @xmath27s .",
    "the cross coherence function between the channels is consistent with unity , and is @xmath28 with 95% confidence for all channels .",
    "we are also able to significantly constrain the time delay in the single qpo peak at @xmath29hz observed 16 march 1996 in 4u  0614 + 091 , and in the single qpo peak at @xmath30hz observed 29 may 1996 in 4u  163653 , as well as the cross coherence in 4u  163653 . in both cases , to optimize @xmath13 , we divided the data into 2 energy channels . in",
    "we find that the oscillations at 6.567  kev lag those at 26.5  kev by @xmath31  @xmath1s and in we find that the oscillations at 12.467  kev lag those at 8.712.4  kev by @xmath32  @xmath1s .",
    "for these two systems we thus have 95% confidence upper limits on the time delay , @xmath33 , of 45@xmath1s ( 4u  0614 + 091 ) and 30@xmath1s ( 4u  163653 ) .",
    "the 95% confidence lower limit to the cross coherence is 0.85 in 4u  163653 .",
    "the cross coherence function of the qpo in 4u  0614091 could not be meaningfully constrained since cross coherence is a 4th - order statistic with a large variance at small @xmath13 .",
    "we attempted to investigate time lags in observations containing two simultaneous kilohertz qpo peaks .",
    "our best candidate was a 28 february 1996 observation of 4u  163653 with qpo at 900hz and 1176hz ( wijnands 1997 ) .",
    "we were unable to measure the time delay in either of the two qpo peaks due to low @xmath13 .",
    "the small lags we see can not be due to large ( @xmath34 ) and variable time differences that average out to zero .",
    "if the lags were large and variable , we would find phase differences @xmath35 uniformly and randomly distributed on @xmath36 $ ] , large error bars @xmath37 , and small cross coherence .",
    "we have measured time delays between the kilohertz qpo at different photon energies in 4u  1608@xmath3852 , 4u  0614@xmath39091 , and 4u  1636@xmath3853 . in the first source we found a significant hard lag whereas in the latter two sources we found that any time delays are @xmath40s .",
    "the qpo investigated here have fractional rms amplitudes and widths comparable to those of the horizontal - branch oscillations in the z sources but their frequencies are 1040 times higher , so we are sensitive to time lags 1040 times smaller . in 4u  1608@xmath3852",
    ", the @xmath41s time lag is equivalent to a phase difference of @xmath42  radians , or about @xmath43 .",
    "the time lags we have measured can be used to derive general constraints on the x - ray production mechanisms in these systems ( see lamb 1988 ) .",
    "it is important to consider these constraints in the larger context of the time lags , energy spectra , power spectra , and cross coherence between the oscillations at different photon energies .",
    "any physical model should be consistent with all four of these statistical properties .",
    "if the x - ray spectrum is not formed predominantly by compton scattering , then the @xmath44  hz oscillation at 1116  kev must be produced so that it lags the oscillation at 46  kev by @xmath41s in 4u  1608@xmath3852 .",
    "delays must be @xmath40s in 4u  0614@xmath39091 and 4u  1636@xmath3853 .",
    "the high value ( @xmath45 ) of the cross coherence in 4u  1636@xmath3853 and 4u  1608@xmath3852 requires that if the source of photons responsible for the qpo is physically extended , the lags in the emission process must be independent of location ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ; nowak & vaughan 1996 ) . any model in which the qpo are produced at the surface of a neutron star that is also a pulsar must explain why the qpo are seen but the periodic oscillations are hidden .",
    "we now consider models in which photons produced near the neutron star are upscattered by electrons in a region with optical depth @xmath46 .",
    "optically thin free - free emission in a scattering region @xmath47100 km in size supplies too few photons to account for the observed luminosity of the atoll sources , which is @xmath00.1 @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the photons must be produced in a self - absorbed region , such as the outer layers of the neutron star .",
    "given the observed luminosities of these sources , any thermal emission from the neutron star peaks at @xmath012 kev .",
    "no such peak is observed , indicating that the scattering region has an optical depth of @xmath49 .",
    "models of this type provide a natural explanation for the x - ray spectra of these sources ( see lamb 1989 ; psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) and may also offer an explanation of their rapid x - ray variability ( see miller , lamb , & psaltis 1997 for an overview ) .",
    "we analyze the generic properties of models of this type , avoiding special geometries or physical conditions .",
    "the fractional rms amplitudes of the kilohertz qpo can be used to place an upper bound on the sizes of emitting regions in all kilohertz qpo sources .",
    "quite generally , the size of the region must be less than a few times @xmath50 , independent of the qpo mechanism , since radiation from different parts of the region have different path lengths to the observer , causing phase shifts that attenuate the qpo signal . if the radiation is scattered , the rms amplitude at infinity of a luminosity oscillation with frequency @xmath51 and amplitude @xmath52 at the center of a spherical region of radius @xmath53 and optical depth @xmath54 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( kylafis & phinney 1989 ) .",
    "the @xmath57  hz qpo studied here have rms amplitudes @xmath58 , so if they are luminosity oscillations the scattering region must be smaller than @xmath59  km if @xmath60 .",
    "if instead they are beaming oscillations , the scattering region must be smaller than @xmath61  km if @xmath60 .",
    "these bounds are almost independent of the electron temperature and bulk velocity in the scattering region , and remain approximately valid for non - spherical regions .",
    "the time lags reported here , if caused by upscattering , provide stringent constraints on the size , @xmath53 , of the upscattering region .",
    "we first compute a rough , qualitative estimate of @xmath53 .",
    "if photons with energy @xmath62 are injected into a scattering region where the electron temperature @xmath63 is @xmath64 , they will gain energy each time they scatter , so photons that escape with a higher energy @xmath65 emerge later than photons that escape with a lower energy @xmath66 .",
    "the delay @xmath33 in the arrival time at a distant observer of photons of energy @xmath65 relative to photons of energy @xmath66 depends on the geometry of the region and the spatial distribution of its electron density and temperature but will be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the photon mean free path and @xmath69 is the difference in the average number of scatterings experienced by photons that emerge with energies @xmath66 and @xmath65 . if @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the average number of scatterings to escape from the cloud , then @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the optical depth . for @xmath74s , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ,",
    "the inferred size of the scattering region is a few kilometers .    to estimate the size of the region more quantitatively ,",
    "note that if the scattering electrons are nonrelativistic , then after one scattering the average energy of a photon with initial energy @xmath62 is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the electron rest mass ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 , ch .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the energies of two photons that experience a different number of scatterings is @xmath79 .",
    "solving this expression for @xmath69 and using the above expression for @xmath33 gives ( see , e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) @xmath80 for 4u  1608@xmath3852 , we have measured @xmath81 to be @xmath82  km for @xmath83  kev and @xmath84  kev , and hence @xmath85 .",
    "photons injected with energies @xmath86 into a region with a compton parameter @xmath87 that is less than the saturation value @xmath88 emerge with a spectrum that is roughly a power law with an exponential cutoff at @xmath89 .",
    "the countrate spectra of the atoll sources indicate @xmath90  kev ( white , stella , & parmar 1988 ) , in which case @xmath53 must be greater than @xmath91  km .",
    "compton upscattering produces hard time lags only if it is unsaturated , i.e. , only if @xmath92 , so @xmath53 must also be less than @xmath93  km . combining these upper and lower limits , we find @xmath94 where we have scaled the expressions to @xmath75 , the value suggested by models of the x - ray spectra and rapid x - ray variability of the atoll sources",
    "( see for example lamb 1989 ; psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "in this analysis we have assumed that soft photons are injected at the center of a spherical region of uniform temperature and electron density .",
    "if any of these conditions are not satisfied , the bounds on the size of the compton upscattering region are larger than those derived above . we have also assumed that @xmath95 .",
    "if instead @xmath96 , the energy change in each scattering of photons with energy near @xmath65 is significantly less than we have assumed , so @xmath33 is significantly greater than in equation  ( 1 ) and the bounds on @xmath53 are correspondingly smaller than estimated above .",
    "however , the value of @xmath65 used here ( 14  kev ) is less than the @xmath97  kev lower bound on @xmath98 inferred from the x - ray spectra of the atoll sources , so this effect is probably small .",
    "we expect that the upscattering region is in reality inhomogeneous and that the size of the upscattering region is closer to the lower bound rather than the upper bound in inequality  ( 2 ) ( see miller et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this is natural since we know the 4u  160852 is a neutron star because it produces type  i x - ray bursts ( see brandt et al . 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "compton upscattering by electron orbital motions may also be important in forming the x - ray spectra of these sources .",
    "if the radiation field is nearly isotropic and the typical orbital velocity of the electrons is @xmath99 , the spectrum that emerges from the scattering region is roughly a power law up to a cutoff energy @xmath100 ( psaltis & lamb 1997 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 , which can easily be attained in regions as close to the neutron star as we are considering , then @xmath102kev . if compton upscattering by electron bulk motion is important , the time lags will depend upon the radial dependence of @xmath99 , but the bounds on the size of the scattering region remain about the same .    in summary ,",
    "the time lags we have measured indicate that the compton upscattering region in is between a few kilometers and a few tens of kilometers in size , i.e. , comparable to the size of a neutron star .",
