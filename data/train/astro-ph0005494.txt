    "it is still a mystery what is the central engine for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the central engine should be able to provide not only the enormous amount of energy ( up to @xmath0 ergs ) for explaining the luminosity and the time duration of grbs , but also the huge bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath1 ) for explaining the rapid variability of the luminosity and the non - thermal feature of the spectrum ( piran 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "this requires that the energy produced by the central engine should be clean of baryonic contamination .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism associated with stellar mass black holes has been suggested to power grbs ( paczyski 1993,1998 ; mszros & rees 1997 ; lee , wijers , & brown 2000 ) . with magnetic field lines threading the horizon of a kerr black hole",
    ", the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted by the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) .",
    "though it has been argued that the blandford - znajek mechanism can provide the required enormous energy , it remains unclear if the energy extracted from the black hole is clean enough for producing the huge bulk lorentz factor .",
    "in fact , when some open magnetic field lines thread the accretion disk which rotates around the black hole , the angular momentum and the gravitational binding energy of the disk can be extracted by the magnetic field lines and an outflow of matter can be produced ( blandford 1976 ; blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "it has been argued that in the case of a thin accretion disk the power of the disk dominates the power of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; livio , ogilvie , & pringle 1999 ; li 2000a ; for different views see armitage & natarajan 1999 , and lee , brown , & wijers 2000 ) .",
    "the supper - eddington power of the disk drives a strong baryon wind from the disk , thus the energy extracted from the disk is expected to be full of matter and get mixed up with the energy extracted from the black hole .",
    "therefore , it remains a question if the blandford - znajek mechanism can produce clean energy .",
    "in this paper we present a model for making clean energy with a kerr black hole .",
    "consider a kerr black hole with a dense plasma torus spinning around it .",
    "the central plane of the torus lies in the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole .",
    "a toroidal electric current flows on the surface of the torus , which generates a poloidal magnetic field outside the torus .",
    "the electric current flows in the same direction as the spin of the black hole , so on the rotational axis the magnetic field is parallel to the spin of the black hole . on the surface of the torus",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to the surface of the torus , and the magnetic pressure balances the gas pressure of the torus .",
    "the magnetic field lines near the rotational axis thread the horizon of the black hole .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the topological structure of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "suppose the model is stable and there is no accretion .",
    "the huge voltage drop along the magnetic field lines near the horizon of the black hole , which is induced by the rotation of the black hole , gives rise to a cascade production of electron - positron pairs ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "a magnetosphere of electron - positron pairs is thus built up around the black hole . due to the small radii of the plasma particles in the strong magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetic field lines winding around the torus prevent the plasma particles from leaving the torus  like the magnetic confinement mechanism for tokamaks in controlled nuclear fusion .",
    "the baryonic contamination from the torus is thus greatly suppressed by the magnetic confinement if the magnetic field is strong enough .",
    "since there are no open magnetic field lines threading the torus and no accretion , the power of the torus is zero",
    ". if some magnetic field lines threading the horizon of the black hole are open and connect with loads , clean energy can be extracted from the black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism .    in the following sections we estimate the time scales relevant to the model outlined above , and the baryonic contamination from the torus . based on these estimations",
    "we demonstrate that clean energy can be produced by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "possible applications of the model in producing grbs are also discussed .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field in the model outlined above ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) can not be in a exactly steady state , it will diffuse into the torus . however , if the plasma in the torus is perfectly conducting , the speed of diffusion for the magnetic field is very slow . to see this ,",
    "suppose the plasma in the torus has an electric resistivity caused by coulomb collisions ( goldston & rutherford 1995 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a cut - off factor resulting from debye shielding , @xmath4 is the temperature of the plasma . the diffusion time for a magnetic field in a conductor is ( jackson 1975 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the characteristic length of the spatial variation of magnetic fields , @xmath7 is the resistivity of the conductor , and @xmath8 is the speed of light . inserting equation ( [ tres ] ) into equation ( [ dtime ] ) , we get the diffusion time for the magnetic field in the torus @xmath9 where we have taken @xmath10 .",
    "the length @xmath6 in equation ( [ tt ] ) represents the depth that the magnetic field diffuses into the torus .",
    "the diffusion speed of the magnetic field is @xmath11 which decreases with increasing @xmath6 . because of the small resistivity of the plasma , the magnetic field diffuses into the torus very slowly .",
    "suppose the kerr black hole is nearly extreme , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath14 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole , and @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the total energy that can be extracted by the blandford - znajek mechanism is ( li 2000c ; see also okamoto 1992 , and lee , wijers , & brown 2000 ) @xmath16 the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism is ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the strength of the magnetic field on the horizon of the black hole . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauss , @xmath21 greatly exceeds the eddington limit @xmath22 the working time of the blandford - znajek mechanism is @xmath23 during the time of @xmath24 , the depth that the magnetic field diffuses into the torus is @xmath25 which is small compared with the radius of the black hole horizon : @xmath26 cm .",
    "thus , during the whole process of the blandford - znajek mechanism , the diffusion of the magnetic field into the torus can be neglected .",
    "the poloidal electric current for the blandford - znajek mechanism is carried by the electron - positron pairs in the magnetosphere surrounding the black hole .",
    "the number density of the electron - positron pairs needed by the blandford - znajek mechanism is @xmath27 this amount of electron - positron pairs provide enough conductivity along magnetic field lines , but negligible conductivity across magnetic field lines .",
    "the poloidal electric current flows along magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , crosses magnetic field lines in the load region and inside the black hole . since in our model",
    "there are no open magnetic field lines threading the torus , and no magnetic field lines connecting the black hole with the torus , the poloidal current does not flow through the torus .",
    "in other words , the torus does not participate in the process of energy extraction and transportation . in our model ,",
    "the only role played by the torus is to provide the toroidal current for sustaining the poloidal magnetic field .    in the magnetosphere",
    "the motion of charged particles is dominated by the magnetic field . in other words ,",
    "the coulomb collision frequencies are much smaller than the gyrofrequencies of charged particles .",
    "in such a case , the diffusion coefficient of baryons across the magnetic field is ( goldston & rutherford 1995 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the collision frequency of the baryons with the electrons and the positrons in the magnetosphere , @xmath30 is the larmor radius of the baryons . if the baryons are protons , we have ( spitzer 1978 ) @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective temperature of the electron - positron gas the effective temperature since the electron - positron pairs in the magnetosphere need not to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the velocity dispersion of electrons ( positrons ) , @xmath36 is the mass of electron ( positron ) , and @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant . ] , @xmath4 is the temperature of the protons in the torus since the protons are assumed to escape from the torus . ] , and we have taken @xmath38 in equation ( [ nu ] ) . from equations ( [ npair ] ) - ( [ rl ] ) , we obtain the confinement time for baryons in the torus ( i.e. the diffusion time of baryons across the magnetic field ) @xmath39 which is a huge time scale ! ( remember that the lifetime of our universe is only @xmath40 seconds . )",
    "the ratio of @xmath41 is @xmath42 which is a huge number .",
    "therefore , during the blandford - znajek process the contamination of charged baryons from the torus is negligible .",
    "in our model , all the power of the system comes from the black hole .",
    "the power of the torus is zero since there are no open magnetic field lines threading the torus and no accretion .",
    "the only role played by the torus is to provide the toroidal current for sustaining the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "this is an example that the blandford - znajek mechanism works effectively . because no material can come out the black hole , the energy extracted from the black hole is expected to be clean except the contamination from environments .",
    "a major source of contamination is the plasma in the torus .",
    "however , due to the strong magnetic field that tightly winds around the torus , the contamination by the charged baryons from the fully ionized torus is greatly reduced .",
    "if the charged baryons escape from the surface of the torus at a rate @xmath43 ( number of particles per unit area and per unit time ) , they will diffuse into the funnel regions above and below the black hole at a rate @xmath44 from equation ( [ tbtbz ] ) , @xmath45 is a tiny number with an order of magnitude @xmath46 for @xmath47 gauss , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 k. thus , the contamination from the baryons in the torus is extremely tiny and completely negligible .    for a super - strong magnetic field with @xmath47 gauss , in a balanced state",
    "the internal pressure of the plasma in the torus is @xmath50 dyne @xmath51 , which is high enough for neutronization to take place .",
    "in such a state the interior of the torus is dominated by a neutron gas as in the case of neutron stars .",
    "some of the neutrons may escape from the torus and enter the funnel regions above and below the black hole , but the amount is not expected to be much since the neutron gas is enveloped by ions and magnetic fields .",
    "further more , since the energy exchange between neutrons and electrons / positrons is very ineffective ( fuller , pruet , & abazajian 2000 ) , the pollution of neutrons is not a problem here .",
    "the neutronization process will also produce a lot of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , the annihilation of them will produce electron - positron pairs .    given the above estimations and arguments , the baryonic contamination from the torus is completely negligible during the whole process of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "if the system starts with a clean environment ( suppose all baryonic particles either fall into the black hole or sit in the torus at the beginning ) , then the environment ( at least in the funnel regions above and below the black hole ) will be kept clean from the contamination by the baryonic particles from the torus .",
    "then the content in the magnetosphere is overwhelmingly dominated by the electron - positron pairs in both number and mass .",
    "the mass density of the electron - positron pairs in the magnetosphere is @xmath52 where equation ( [ npair ] ) has been used .",
    "the mass density of the baryonic particles in the interstellar medium is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number density of the baryonic particles in the interstellar medium , which is @xmath55 in the regions of ionized gas around recently formed massive stars ( garay & lizano 1999 ) .",
    "since @xmath56 is only a tiny fraction ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath58 , the baryonic contamination from the interstellar medium is also negligible .",
    "it is far from clear where the loads are and how the energy of the poynting flux produced by the blandford - znajek mechanism is converted into the kinetic energy of plasma particles ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ; li 2000b ) .",
    "the consideration of the instability of the magnetic field indicates that the loads can not be far from the black hole and the energy extracted from the black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism should be converted into the kinetic energy of plasma particles close to the black hole ( li 2000b ) .",
    "suppose the energy extracted from the black hole is converted into the kinetic energy of the plasma particles in the magnetosphere to produce an outflow of electron - positron pairs .",
    "the mass flow is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cross - sectional area of the flow .",
    "if the efficiency in converting poynting flux into the kinetic energy is @xmath61 , the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow is @xmath62 where equation ( [ powr ] ) and equation ( [ mflow ] ) have been used ) gives a lower limit on the number density of electron - positron pairs in the magnetosphere .",
    "the number density of electron - positron pairs in the magnetosphere may be greater than that given in equation ( [ npair ] ) , then the lorentz factor of the outflow is somewhat smaller than that given in equation ( [ gamma ] ) . ] .",
    "thus , the black hole produces two oppositely directed jets of electron - positron pairs with super - high bulk lorentz factors along the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "the jets can not produce grbs by themselves since they have too high lorentz factors and too few baryons .",
    "however , the jets will collide and interact with the interstellar medium .",
    "the interaction between the jets and the interstellar medium will load more baryons to the jets and decelerate the jets , which may produce grbs and the afterglows .",
    "the magnetic configuration in the model is reasonable in physics , but a real case may not be so simple .",
    "the toroidal current may distribute in the entire space inside the torus , not just on the surface .",
    "in such a case , a poloidal magnetic field will also exist inside the torus .",
    "but we can still imagine that the surface of the torus coincides with a toroidal magnetic surface , so that on the surface of the torus the magnetic field is parallel to the surface and outside the torus the poloidal magnetic field is still like that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . inside the torus",
    "the magnetic surfaces are nested toroidal surfaces .",
    "this is a very natural configuration of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal electric current flowing in the torus .",
    "because of the differential rotation of the torus , the plasma and the magnetic field inside the torus are subject to the balbus - hawley instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) . within a few rotational periods",
    "the magnetic field lines inside the torus become chaotic and tangled , the torus becomes turbulent .",
    "if there is no magnetic field outside the torus and the plasma density outside the torus is low , the boundary of the torus is free and the turbulence inside the torus will make the torus expand and lead to strong accretion ( hawley 2000 ) .",
    "however , in our model there is a hard `` magnetic wall '' surrounding the torus , which confines the plasma in the torus so that the boundary of the torus is not free .",
    "the `` magnetic wall '' may suppress the accretion and the expansion .",
    "thus , the effects of the balbus - hawley instability inside the torus will just be to redistribute the angular momentum and heat the plasma in the torus . the transfer of angular momentum within the torus caused by the balbus - hawley instability will spread the torus in radial direction .",
    "the heat generated by the balbus - hawley instability may be rapidly radiated away by neutrinos .",
    "however , these do not affect the topology of the magnetic field outside the torus .",
    "since the magnetosphere has a very low mass density , the magnetic field outside the torus does not suffer from the balbus - hawley instability .",
    "no matter how complex the magnetic field inside the torus is , the magnetic field outside the torus is ordered and has the topology shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field inside the torus is unimportant for our current purposes , it is the magnetic field outside the torus that is relevant to the blandford - znajek mechanism and the magnetic confinement .",
    "if we only consider the magnetic field outside the torus , it is always equivalent to assuming an electric current flowing on the surface of the torus .",
    "thus , the magnetic field structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is quite general even for real cases .",
    "all the requirements for our model are a kerr black hole with a dense torus , and a toroidal electric current flowing in the torus .",
    "a kerr black hole with a dense torus spinning around it may form from the merger of two neutron star , or the merger of a black hole and a neutron star , or directly from the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star ( narayan , paczyski , & piran 1992 ; woosley 1993 ) .",
    "but it is quite unclear how the current flows in the torus .",
    "let s consider the collapse of a magnetized and rapidly rotating massive star .",
    "if the magnetic field of the star is dipole - like , the magnetic field lines near the equatorial region are closed , while those in the polar cap region are open .",
    "if the star has too much angular momentum , a dense torus will be left behind and rotates around the kerr black hole that is formed by the core collapse ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "because of the different strength of the centrifugal force , the stellar material in the polar cap region collapses into the kerr black hole but the stellar mantle near the equatorial region is left in the torus .",
    "it is possible that all open magnetic field lines are trapped on the horizon of the black hole , only closed magnetic field lines are left in and around the torus . at the beginning ( i.e. the time right after the formation of the torus ) the magnetic field may have a very complicated structure , but after the torus settles in a somewhat steady state it can be expected that the magnetic field is equivalent to be generated by a toroidal current flowing in the torus .",
    "the balbus - hawley instability may make the magnetic field inside the torus very complicated , but the magnetic field outside the torus is stable and is effectively generated by a toroidal current flowing on the surface of the torus .",
    "this provides a possible astronomical scenario which produces a magnetic field as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as another (",
    "probably more ideal and extreme ) example , assume that the distribution of the magnetic field in the star is so non - uniform that right after the core collapse all the magnetic field lines are trapped on the horizon of the kerr black hole , none are left in the torus .",
    "this produces such an initial state : a non - magnetized torus rotating around a highly magnetized kerr black hole . but",
    "this state can not be kept for a long time since the black hole has no steady internal current to sustain the magnetic field .",
    "a black hole is a poor conductor , a magnetic field diffuses away from the horizon of a black hole at the speed of light ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) .",
    "thus the magnetic field lines leave the black hole quickly .",
    "the change in the magnetic flux through the horizon of the black hole induces a transient toroidal current on the horizon , which causes energy dissipation and slows down the black hole .",
    "but the effect is not significant since the energy stored in the magnetic field is much smaller than the vast rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "the expanding magnetic field lines will finally hit the torus that rotates around the black hole .",
    "since the plasma in the torus has very small resistivity , it will be very difficult for the magnetic field to diffuse into the torus . in stead",
    ", the magnetic field lines will bend over the torus , close on themselves , and a strong toroidal current will be induced on the surface of the torus .",
    "the magnetic field lines embracing the torus will compress the torus and enhance the temperature and the gas pressure inside the torus , until a balanced state is reached . in the balanced state the pressure of the plasma in",
    "the torus balances the pressure of the magnetic field at the surface of the torus , and the electric current at the surface of the torus sustains the magnetic field of the system .",
    "this magnetic field formed in this scenario is just like that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the model is more or less similar to the tokamak in controlled nuclear fusion : they both use magnetic fields to confine plasma .",
    "it is well - known that both tori and tokamaks suffer from various hydrodynamical and megnetohydrodynamical instabilities ( balbus & hawley 1998 ; bateman 1978 ) .",
    "it seems no doubt that such instabilities must also exist in the torus in our model , but it is unclear what their consequences are",
    ". an instability may be so strong that the global equilibrium structure of the model is destroyed , then the model will not work . on the other hand , an instability that saturates at a modest amplitude may have little effect .",
    "it is also possible that an instability acts as a significant mechanism for transporting angular momentum in the torus but does not destroy the global equilibrium state ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "the issue of stabilities is so complex that it is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "thus , in this paper we do nt try to test the instabilities . instead ,",
    "assuming the instabilities are not strong enough to destroy the global configuration in the model , we look into the consequences of the model .",
    "we have presented a model for making clean energy with a kerr black hole . assuming a toroidal current flows on the surface of the torus spinning around a kerr black hole , a poloidal magnetic field is generated outside the torus .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field winds around the torus , compresses and confines the torus in a way similar to tokamaks for controlled nuclear fusion . assuming the torus is stable and has no accretion , a clean magnetosphere of electron - positron pairs is built up around the black hole . the baryonic contamination from the torus is greatly suppressed by the magnetic confinement if the magnetic field is strong enough . since there are no open magnetic field lines threading the torus and no accretion , the power of the torus is zero .",
    "this provides an ideal environment for the working of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "if some magnetic field lines threading the horizon of the kerr black hole are open and connect with loads , clean energy can be extracted from the black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism .    in a real case",
    "the toroidal electric current may flow in the entire space inside the torus , not just on the surface .",
    "however , if we only consider the magnetic field outside the torus , the magnetic field is effectively generated by a toroidal current flowing on the surface of the torus , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in our model",
    "we have neglected various dynamical instabilities .",
    "the instabilities are important and may make the model unstable , but we look into the consequences of the model if it is stable .",
    "the energy extracted by the blandford - znajek mechanism comes out of the black hole in the form of poynting flux . if the energy in the poynting flux is converted into the kinetic energy of the plasma particles in the magnetosphere which is dominated by electron - positron pairs , two oppositely directed jets of electron - positron pairs with super - high lorentz factors given by equation ( [ gamma ] )",
    "will be produced along the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "the jets will collide and interact with the interstellar medium , which may produce grbs and the afterglows .",
    "this suggests a tokamak model for grbs .    in the traditional model of a kerr black hole with a thin disk ,",
    "the toroidal current flowing in the disk generates a poloidal magnetic field threading the horizon of the black hole as well as the disk .",
    "if some magnetic field lines threading the disk are open , energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the disk , which drives a strong baryon wind from the disk ( blandford 1976 ; blandford & payne 1982 ) . at large distance from the black hole and the disk ,",
    "the magnetic field becomes weak and the inertia of particles becomes important .",
    "in fact , in the load region particles must flow across magnetic field lines to close the poloidal electric current .",
    "thus , it can be expected that at large distance the baryon wind from the disk will get mixed with the clean energy extracted from the black hole , though close to the black hole they may be separated from each other . in other words , for the traditional model , one may expect clean energy to flow along the magnetic field lines threading the black hole only if the baryons lost from the disk do not mix in . while in our model , the baryons are prevented from leaving the torus since there are no open magnetic field lines threading the torus .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to present a novel geometry of magnetic fields for a popular object : a spinning black hole and a magnetized torus around it . while it is far from clear if such a configuration can be formed in a realistic astrophysical context , and if it can be stable for a long enough time to allow a significant extraction of the spin energy of the black hole , we present it here as it has a nice property : it offers a possibility for extracting clean energy with no baryonic contamination .",
    "probably the specific configuration of the magnetic field in the model can only exist in some special circumstances .",
    "however , we should remember that grbs are very rare  about @xmath63 times less common than supernovae ( paczyski 1999 ) ."
