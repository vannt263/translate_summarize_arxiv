    "the problem of charge ordering ( co ) attracted the attention of physicists already at the end of the thirties . in the low density limit , as was first proposed by wigner @xcite , the electrons crystallize in form of a lattice in order to keep the coulomb repulsion as small as possible .",
    "such a wigner lattice is experimentally realized in a gaas / algaas heterostructure @xcite .",
    "the co may also occur at higher electron concentration if the interaction of electrons with spin degrees of freedom or with phonons drastically reduces the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "recently the co is extensively observed in real materials at high densities : hole ordering in rare - earth pnictides like @xmath3 @xcite , charge ordering in the unconventional spin - peierls material @xmath4 @xcite and in colossal magnetoresistance compounds , for example in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "+ one of the simplest models of interacting electrons that allows for charge ordering is the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) .",
    "this model has been intensively studied both in low dimensions and in the limit of infinite dimension , usually at half or at quarter filling . a variety of techniques , such as hartree - fock approximation @xcite , perturbation theory @xcite , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , slave boson approach @xcite , as well as numerical methods like quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite and lanczos technique @xcite have been employed .",
    "obviously , each of these approaches is able to describe in a proper way only one of the relevant limits of the model and despite many publications devoted to the co in solids the physical picture of the phenomenon is far from being clear .",
    "+ recently a melting of the charge ordered state on decreasing the temperature has been found in the doped compounds @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite . a reentrant transition at quarter filling has been obtained theoretically using ehm both with electron - phonon interaction @xcite and without electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to study of the boundary between the charge ordered and disordered phase for different regimes of the temperature @xmath9 , the coulomb interactions @xmath10 and the band filling @xmath11 . a simple but physically meaningful approximation allowing to solve",
    "this problem is the cpa .",
    "this self - consistent approximation is recognized as the best single - site approximation for the spectral properties of disordered systems .",
    "originally , the alloy - analog approximation has been formulated as an approximation scheme for the hubbard model @xcite . to solve the alloy problem the cpa is used as a second step .",
    "the cpa was also applied to intermediate valence and heavy fermion systems @xcite . in the present work",
    "this approximation is used for the first time to treat the charge ordering in the ehm .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian for the ehm : @xmath12 where @xmath13 annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath14 at site @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes nearest neighbors , @xmath2 is the hopping parameter , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on - site and inter - site coulomb repulsion , respectively .",
    "we divide the hypercubic lattice in two sublattices such that points on one sublattice have only points of the other sublattice as nearest neighbors .",
    "the sublattice is denoted by subindex a or b : @xmath18 if @xmath19 . performing a mean - field decoupling of the @xmath1 term , we get @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of nearest neighbors , @xmath22 is the averaged electron occupation number in the a / b - sublattice , @xmath23 is the number of sites in the lattice .",
    "+ in the alloy - analog approach the many - body hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) is replaced by a one - particle hamiltonian with disorder which is of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 in the following we assume spin - independent expectation values in ( [ 4 ] ) , i.e. we consider only nonmagnetic solution : @xmath26 .",
    "the green function @xmath27 corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) has to be averaged over all possible configurations of the random potential which can be considered to be due to alloy constituents .",
    "the averaging can not be performed exactly . to solve the alloy problem",
    "the cpa is used .",
    "the averaged green function @xmath28 is obtained from an effective hamiltonian containing a self - energy @xmath29 for the a / b - sublattice : @xmath30 in momentum space the averaged green functions @xmath31 for the a / b - sublattice are of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fourier transform of the hopping matrix element ( the wavevector @xmath34 is for sublattice a ( or b ) ) , @xmath35 are to be determined latter . + the density of states ( dos ) for free electrons with the band dispersion @xmath36",
    "is replaced by the semi - elliptical @xmath37 ( we set @xmath38 = 1 as the unit for the energy scale ) .",
    "note that this model dos is often used as an additional approximation in combination with the cpa .",
    "it was noted in ref.@xcite that for the bethe lattice with @xmath39 this approximation is a good one , at least in a qualitative sense .",
    "the averaged green functions @xmath40 for the a / b - sublattice then take the form    @xmath41^{1/2}\\biggr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath42 is obtained by replacing @xmath43 .",
    "a scattering matrix @xmath9 is introduced for each configuration via @xmath44 the cpa demands that the scattering matrix vanishes on average : @xmath45 .",
    "this yields expression for @xmath29 of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "again @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained by replacing @xmath43 .",
    "+ for arbitrary size of electron density @xmath11 we make the following ansatz : @xmath50 eliminating @xmath51 from ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) leads to an equation for @xmath52 : @xmath53\\cdot\\\\ & & \\bigg [ zv(n - x ) + u - \\omega + \\frac{g(-x,\\omega)}{4 } + \\frac{1}{g(x , \\omega ) } \\bigg ] g(x,\\omega)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting @xmath54 in eq.([11 ] ) and shifting the one - electron energy by @xmath55 we reproduce the cpa equation for the green function obtained by velicky et al in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ if @xmath56 is the chemical potential of electrons , then at the temperature @xmath9 one has @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the matsubara frequencies and @xmath59 is the fermi function .",
    "+ the pair of equations ( [ 12 ] ) must now be solved with the constraint @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath56 . for small enough @xmath1 the solution of (",
    "[ 12 ] ) is the charge disordered state with @xmath62 .",
    "but if @xmath1 is sufficiently large it may also be possible to find the co solution for which @xmath63 .",
    "one finds that the condition for the onset of charge ordering is equivalent to @xmath64 being a double solution of ( [ 12 ] ) . this condition is expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a solution of ( [ 11 ] )",
    "when @xmath68 .",
    "the latter is a cubic equation for @xmath69 and the correct root must be identified from the physical condition to yield a non - negative density of states .",
    "it is also easy to obtain @xmath70 from eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "so , for fixed temperature @xmath9 , on - site coulomb repultion @xmath0 and band filling @xmath11 we have the closed system of equations ( [ 13])-([14 ] ) for the critical value @xmath1 and the chemical potential @xmath56 within the framework of the cpa .",
    "we have solved numerically eqs .",
    "( [ 13])-([14 ] ) , the results may be summarized as follows . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] phase diagram as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath1 for different values of @xmath0 for the two - dimensional square lattice at zero temperature .",
    "the half - bandwith @xmath38 was taken as unit of energy ( for the square lattice @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) . due to the electron - hole symmetry",
    "we consider only @xmath73 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can see that in the two regions @xmath74 the influence of @xmath0 on the boundary between the charge ordered and the homogenous disordered phase is different : away from half filling @xmath75 the on - site interaction @xmath0 has little effect on the critical value @xmath76 , while for @xmath77 the critical @xmath76 strongly depends on @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite dho",
    "et al found that co exists over a broad doping range @xmath78 in la@xmath79sr@xmath80mn@xmath81o@xmath82 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that for large @xmath0 in the same filling region the cpa values of @xmath76 are close the minimum value ( @xmath76 has the minimum at @xmath83 ) .",
    "although the mechanism of the charge ordering in the layered manganites is more complex than one induced by a nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion , from the above result we may speculate that the cpa is able to describe the co boundary in this compound .",
    "in addition , the advantage of the cpa is that by using this simple approach one can easily obtain phase diagrams in the @xmath84-@xmath85-plane for arbitrary @xmath0 as well as in the @xmath86-@xmath87-plane at arbitrary @xmath11 . as an illustration of our approach in the",
    "following we consider co transition on the square lattice at quarter filling @xmath88 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xmath86-@xmath87-phase diagram at zero temperature .",
    "we compare cpa result to the one obtained by other methods . at @xmath89 the critical value @xmath90 and @xmath91 obtained in ref.@xcite by the slave boson approach with a constant and the actual dos @xmath92 respectively ,",
    "is in a good agreement with our result @xmath93 . at @xmath94",
    "was obtained in ref.@xcite for the ehm in infinite dimension by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , while the cpa result for our 2d lattice is @xmath95 .    in ref.@xcite mckenzie",
    "et al argue that in the large @xmath0 limit at quarter filling the charge ordered phase is destroyed below a critical non - zero value @xmath76 , of the order of @xmath2 , while we can now show in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the critical value @xmath76 is almost independent of @xmath0 , therefore @xmath76 is of the order of @xmath2 for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xmath96-@xmath87-phase diagram for different values of @xmath0 . for each value of @xmath0 reentrant behavior as function of temperature",
    "is seen for some region of @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath1 in this range , the ground state is homogeneous but a charge ordered phase exists at intermediate temperature . note that reentrant transition apparently is not obtained by hartree - fock approximation in the ehm without electron - phonon interaction .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the @xmath96-@xmath87-phase diagram for @xmath97 at different band fillings @xmath11 .",
    "the reentrant behavior is seen clearly for the values of @xmath11 where @xmath98 is larger ( e.g. @xmath99 ) , while for values of @xmath11 where @xmath98 is small ( e.g. @xmath100 ) , the reentrant behavior is not seen .",
    "+ in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the cpa result for @xmath1 dependence of the sublattice occupancies @xmath101 and @xmath102 and hence the charge order parameter @xmath103 in the strong correlated limit @xmath104 at zero temperature .",
    "the transition is clearly continuous in contrast to the result for @xmath105 in ref .",
    "@xcite where the nrg method gives a first order phase transition .",
    "note that in the strong correlated limit @xmath104 from eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) one can find an analytic expression for @xmath106 .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) have to solved self - consistently to find @xmath61 and @xmath56 . for a given set of these parameters",
    "the total energy of the system for various states can be calculated .",
    "the state with the lowest energy is the true ground state and determines the spectrum .",
    "the cpa result for a and b spectral functions for @xmath107 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . when @xmath108 the a and b spectral functions are identical and they are independent of @xmath1 by shifting all the one - electron energy levels and the chemical potential by @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath110 the a and b spectral functions change and each spectrum splits in the upper and lower subbands . on increasing @xmath1 the weight of the lower subband in the a - spectrum increases ,",
    "while the one in the b - spectrum decreases ; the subbands in the spectrum become narrower due to the reduced hopping of electrons in the charge ordered phase .",
    "a charge ordering gap opens and it is given by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath1 , perfect charge order evolves : @xmath113 . therefore in this limit @xmath114 and the gap between two peaks @xmath115 is given in cpa by @xmath116 , as compared to @xmath109 obtained by the dmft in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have applied the cpa to study charge ordering in the extended hubbard model . within this approximation",
    "one can obtain the critical value @xmath76 as a function of temperatute @xmath9 , on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 and band filling @xmath11 . to examine the cpa results we consider the charge ordering transition on the 2d square lattice at quarter filling using a semi - elliptical dos .",
    "it was shown that for all values of @xmath0 the charge ordered phase is destroyed below a critical non - zero value @xmath76 of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "like previous results in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find a parameter region where the model shows reentrant behavior .",
    "the reentrant transition is also observed at other band filling , as it was experimentally found in the layered manganites in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the strong correlation limit @xmath104 at zero temperature the cpa gives a continuous transition .",
    "+ now the cpa is known to give good results of one - particle properties in a wide range of systems . to study the co boundary phase in the ehm the cpa has the advantage over dmft of being analytically simple , and over hartree - fock approximation ( small @xmath0 ) and slave boson approach @xmath117 of being able to describe the whole range for the on - site interaction @xmath0 .",
    "of course in common with the alloy cpa the imaginary part of the self - energy does not vanish at the fermi level at @xmath118 , so we do not obtain a true fermi liquid and we only expect our cpa to study co in the ehm well at finite temperature . + the calculation presented here can also be applied to the lattice of higher dimensions , or to the ehm in the presence of a weak magnetic field . to include magnetic phases and cluster effects",
