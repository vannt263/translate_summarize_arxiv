    "the accurate calibration of optical and near infrared photometry was a primary objective of snap / jdem @xcite , since renamed wfirst @xcite , a space - based mission to study dark energy .",
    "in particular , systematics - limited measurements of the dark energy parameters based on snia observations required broadband filter measurements with a top - down error budget of 2% color error and a 1.5% in - band error @xcite . to achieve these ambitious goals snap / jdem considered a multi - technique approach to focal plane calibration that included accurate stellar photometry and an onboard flat fielding illumination system . for the low - frequency spatial flats ( l - flats ) that characterize large scale , many - pixel variations across the focal plane , the technique favored was to dither large ensembles of stars across the focal plane and to measure the stars offsets from the ensemble mean @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "high - frequency spatial flats ( s - flats ) , or small scale few - pixel variations across the focal plane , are typically monitored by a flat - fielding illumination system . for snap / jdem ,",
    "one version of this onboard calibration light system included filament lamps and/or pulsed leds , light sources that were to be driven at constant current .",
    "since the accuracy of such high - frequency flat fielding systems depends strongly on the capacity to compensate for variations in the illuminators , stable and precisely calibrated photodiode detectors were included to monitor the light sources .",
    "modern calibration strategies to achieve flat fielding goals as challenging as those required for the snap / jdem high frequency flats are typically based upon monitoring photodiodes calibrated to the state - of - the - art by nist or equivalent national standards laboratories . since snap / jdem was planned as a multiyear mission at the l2 lagrange point , approximately @xmath2 km from earth , we studied these monitoring photodiodes for their ability to survive in the radiation environment expected .",
    "as described by @xcite , solar protons dominate the radiation environment at l2 .",
    "for instance , in a six year mission with an experiment carrying a minimum aluminum equivalent shielding of 9.0 mm with an average shielding thickness of 38 mm , the focal plane monitoring photodiodes would be exposed to fluences of order @xmath3  @xmath4 in the range @xmath5 mev .    in this investigation",
    ", we describe radiation hardness studies of several commercial off - the - shelf ( cots ) ingaas photodiodes and one si photodiode irradiated with protons at energies 30 , 52 , and 98 mev , and with fluences up to @xmath6  @xmath4 at the indiana university cyclotron facility ( iucf ) . in our detector - based calibration scheme for snap / jdem",
    ", we proposed ingaas photodiodes to monitor the nir flat - field illuminators and si photodiodes to monitor the optical illuminators .",
    "the intent was to have all the photodiodes calibrated by nist .",
    "here we examine both the relative spectral response and the overall broadband response of ingaas and si photodiodes as a function of the irradiating proton energy and fluence .",
    "although there have been radiation hardness studies of si photodiodes , including ccds @xcite , there is surprisingly little information on ingaas photodiodes .",
    "as proposed space missions push into the nir ( euclid , wfirst ) , ingaas photodiodes are likely to find wider use in space - based experiments .",
    "in this section we describe the photodiodes tested and the facility where the radiation exposures were made .",
    "the photodiodes tested in these studies were obtained from five optoelectronic manufacturers .",
    "all were cots devices and are listed in table  [ tab : photodiode ] .",
    "the ingaas photodiodes all have a responsivity cutoff at 1700  nm and the si photodiodes have the typical responsivity cutoff at 1000  nm . when possible , the photodiodes were obtained in to-5 packaging , which has been shown to be robust to the shake and heat cycle testing required to qualify for space flight .",
    "only the ingaas photodiodes from advanced photonics were unavailable with this packaging as a cots device .",
    "since our plan was to expose the ingaas photodiodes to protons at three energies , we obtained three ingaas photodiodes from each manufacturer .",
    "we also obtained an additional perkinelmer ingaas photodiode that was not exposed to radiation and which was used as a control to determine systematic errors .",
    "we used 7 osi si photodiodes in this study , one for each fluence we planned on using .",
    "we only needed 7 si photodiodes because they were irradiated at only one energy .",
    "the spectral response measurements of the test photodiodes were made with respect to stable reference photodiodes whose response was calibrated by nist .",
    "the nist - calibrated reference ingaas and si photodiodes are listed in table  [ tab : photodiodes - nist ] .",
    "the photodiodes were irradiated at the radiation effects research program ( rerp ) facility at iucf .",
    "the iucf cyclotron produces 200 mev protons with dosimetry better than 10% @xcite .",
    "the energies chosen for the tests , 30 , 52 and 98 mev , were selected to span a reasonable range of the particle environment expected at l2 @xcite from the range of energies available at rerp .",
    "energies lower than 30 mev are not available .",
    "rerp has both wide band and narrowband beam configurations .",
    "the wide band beam degrades the energy of the 200 mev protons to the program energy using a thick copper plate upstream of the target photodiodes . in the narrowband beam configuration ,",
    "the protons first pass through a magnetic spectrometer that selects out a narrow range of momenta and then these selected protons pass through a beryllium degrader to obtain the program energy .",
    "the advantage of the narrowband beam is that the radiation hardness studies can focus on specific damage mechanisms .",
    "the advantage of the wide band beam is that the proton flux is two orders of magnitude greater than the narrowband beam , thereby reducing exposure times . at 45 mev",
    "the energy resolution in the narrow band beam is approximately 3.3  mev  ( fwhm ) ; for the broadband beam , the energy resolution is approximately 13.5  mev  ( fwhm ) .    for fluences",
    "@xmath7 @xmath4 , we used the narrowband beam and exposure times were a few minutes long . for fluences",
    "@xmath8 @xmath4 , we used the wide band beam to keep the exposure times reasonably short .",
    "exposure information is given in table  [ tab : radruns ] . during radiation exposure ,",
    "all of the target photodiode s pins were connected and grounded .",
    "these investigations were primarily aimed at understanding whether the spectral response of photodiodes degrades in response to the ionizing radiation environment expected at l2 .",
    "we developed the indiana relative responsivity measurement apparatus ( irrma ) to measure dark current and relative spectral response as a function of wavelength ; the apparatus is shown in figure [ fig : hardware ] .",
    "the apparatus consists of a radiance - controlled qth lamp source powered by a constant - current power supply , a monochromator that feeds into an integrating sphere , and a dual - channel picoammeter that measures the output current of the test photodiode and a nist - calibrated reference photodiode simultaneously .",
    "the nist - calibrated photodiode is temperature controlled .",
    "the light source ( 1a ) is a 100 w incandescent qth lamp in a newport photomax housing .",
    "the lamp is powered by a radiometric power supply ( 1b ) controlled by a newport digital exposure controller .",
    "the newport monochromator ( 2 ) has two gratings that span the wavelength range investigated here : 5001000  nm for si photodiodes and 10001600  nm for ingaas photodiodes .",
    "the monochromator slits produce a 4 nm bandpass at the output .",
    "there is a shutter at the input of the monochromator that provides a measurement of the dark current when closed .",
    "the output of the 4@xmath9 labsphere integrating sphere ( 3 ) projects flat illumination onto both the test photodiode and the nist - calibrated reference photodiode .",
    "the two photodiodes are mounted in the dark box ( 4 ) where they simultaneously view the light from the integrating sphere .",
    "a keithley dual - channel picoammeter ( 5 ) measures the two photodiodes with zero external bias .",
    "however , to make the current measurement , the picoammeter by design applies a measured @xmath10 reverse bias to the photodiode which in turn generates a few picoamps of dark current .    the picoammeter sampled the output of the photodiodes at 6 hz at every 2 nm wavelength step . to reduce read noise ,",
    "30 measurements were taken at each wavelength step and averaged .",
    "the dark current was measured every 10th wavelength step , or at 20 nm intervals .",
    "the dark current was subtracted from the signal at each 2 nm step by computing a linear interpolation of the dark current over each 20 nm measurement interval . for the results described in  [ results ] we made two full wavelength scans of each photodiode after an exposure at iucf and we averaged the dark subtracted measurements .",
    "the dark current results we report below are the mean of the dark current measurements for both scans .      after each radiation exposure",
    ", we measured the spectral response of the test photodiodes in irrma concurrently with respect to the stable nist - calibrated reference photodiode .",
    "the reference photodiodes were calibrated by nist with standard spectroradiometric detector calibration services .",
    "after each radiation exposure we made measurements of the test photodiode at each wavelength step and compared these to the reference photodiode at the same wavelength . to minimize systematic errors , we used the fractional change in the ratio of the responses of the test photodiode to the reference photodiode as the test statistic .",
    "the complication with reducing systematic errors in this way , however , is that differences between the response of the test and reference photodiodes can mask or exaggerate real spectral changes due to radiation exposure .",
    "if the spectral response of the reference photodiode at a particular wavelength is large compared with the test photodiode , for instance , significant spectral changes in the test diode would not change the ratio appreciably , thereby masking real spectral changes . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spectral response of the reference diode is small compared with the test diode , small spectral changes in the test diode would lead to large changes in the ratio . to account for different spectral responses of the test and reference photodiodes",
    ", we normalized the ratios with respect to those measured at @xmath11 = 600  nm for si photodiodes or at @xmath11 = 1200  nm for ingaas photodiodes . by normalizing the ratio in this way",
    ", we clearly only measured _ relative _ changes in the spectral response of the test photodiodes .    to be quantitative , we defined @xmath12 as our test statistic .",
    "let @xmath13 = photocurrent response of the test photodiode to the qth lamp at wavelength @xmath14 measured in the @xmath15  nm monochromator bandpass at some time @xmath16 during the experiment and let @xmath17 = the interpolated dark current at time @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath18 = photocurrent response of the nist - calibrated reference photodiode to the qth lamp at wavelength @xmath14 and @xmath19 = its interpolated dark current during the scan . aside from variations in the lamp output , @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "are assumed to have no additional time - dependent behavior .",
    "then the normalized response of the test photodiode relative to the nist calibrated photodiode at wavelength @xmath14 at time @xmath16 , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 \\left/\\left[\\frac{i_{\\lambda}(t ) - d(t)}{n_{\\lambda}- d}\\right]_{\\lambda = \\lambda_{norm}}\\right .",

    "we quantified changes in photodiode response as a result of radiation exposure with the fractional change in @xmath20 , @xmath22      several systematic effects in the apparatus that could introduce uncertainties that mask real changes in the spectral response of the test photodiodes cancel in the ratio defining @xmath20 in eq.([eqn : ntnr ] ) .",
    "for instance , qth lamps have rated lifetimes of 50 hr and needed to be replaced on occasion during the course of these investigations . since both the test photodiode and the nist reference photodiode",
    "see the same lamp light , these systematics cancel in @xmath20 .",
    "one systematic effect not canceled in this way are variations in the test photodiode responsivity introduced by measurements in our laboratory , which is not equipped to maintain a constant temperature for the test photodiode .",
    "since the responsivity of photodiodes as a function of temperature can differ depending on the manufacturer , this systematic effect would not be canceled in @xmath20 .",
    "we tested for this systematic effect by measuring  @xmath23 for an unexposed control perkinelmer ingaas photodiode at 13.4@xmath24c and 17.5@xmath24c , a temperature range greater than we encountered during our measurements . in these measurements , we attached a tec to the back of the photodiode package and used an omega controller to vary the temperature .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempstability ] , which shows clearly that negligible systematic variations of @xmath25 are introduced by temperature variations over this range .",
    "before radiation exposure , we measured the dark current for all of the test photodiodes .",
    "the results of the measurements for the ingaas photodiodes are given in table  [ tab : baselinedark ] ; for the si photodiodes , the dark currents are given in table  [ tab : baselinedarksi ] .",
    "except for the fermionics photodiodes , the baseline dark currents vary by up to a factor of @xmath2650% ; the fermionics photodiodes show considerably greater variation . again excluding fermionics photodiodes ,",
    "the dark currents vary by a factor of @xmath262 from manufacturer to manufacturer ; the fermionics photodiodes are by far the noisiest .",
    "we determined the systematic uncertainties in measurements of the dark current by repeatedly sampling the dark current of the control perkinelmer ingaas photodiode and assuming the dark current of this photodiode did not change .",
    "these measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : darkstability ] . in the left panel ,",
    "the figure shows typical variations in the dark current during a single full - wavelength scan that takes approximately one hour .",
    "the rms / mean for these measurements is @xmath262% .",
    "the right panel shows measurements of the dark current over the duration of the experiment ( @xmath26600 days ) that only includes measurements of the control perkinelmer photodiode made at the same temperature .",
    "for these measurements , the rms / mean in the dark current is @xmath2612% . adding the short term and long term variations in quadrature gives the systematic error in the dark current measurements of @xmath2612% .",
    "after each exposure , we used irrma to test our photodiodes for changes in relative spectral response .",
    "we considered three possibilities .",
    "first , it is possible that radiation exposure did not affect the relative spectral response . in that case",
    ", @xmath12 will be consistent with zero within measurement errors .",
    "however , if the relative spectral response did change , then eq.([eqn : ntnr ] ) shows that there are two different ways that radiation could affect the photodiode . in one ,",
    "radiation exposure damages the spectral response @xmath27 of the photodiode , resulting in a wavelength - dependent change in @xmath23 . in the other",
    ", radiation exposure drives an increase in the dark current @xmath28 , resulting in a wavelength - independent change in @xmath23 .",
    "we have developed a simple @xmath29 statistic to differentiate among these three possibilities , @xmath30 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2 } , \\ ] ] where the sum is over the @xmath31 discrete monochromator measurements in the wavelength range ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 is the model for the radiation damage , and @xmath34 is the rms error in the measurement of @xmath23 in our apparatus .",
    "central to this analysis is the determination of @xmath34 , since it sets the scale that differentiates between real physical effects and measurement error .",
    "we determined @xmath34 for each photodiode individually from the initial @xmath35 measurements taken prior to radiation exposure .",
    "since we have three instances of each photodiode , one for each proton energy , we constructed two @xmath23 data sets  one in which the 52 mev data were compared to the 30 mev data in eq.([eqn : deltantnr ] ) and one in which the 98 mev data were compared to the 30 mev data . assuming the three instances of the the photodiodes are identical , we used the rms of these two distributions to estimate of the @xmath34 in eq.([eqn : chisq ] ) .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] shows the distributions of `` identical '' photodiodes for those manufactured by perkinelmer .",

    "we then used these @xmath34 s to test against the three simple models for radiation damage with eq.([eqn : chisq ] ) .",
    "as usual , our strategy looks for @xmath36 for a successful model fit . for a photodiode that does not change ,",

    "the measured dark current after irradiation did not change in such a way to affect our ability to measure changes in the relative responsivity as a function of wavelength since our photocurrents are much greater than the measured dark currents after irradiation .",

    "all days were treated equally in computing @xmath62 in eq.([eqn : tnr ] ) , a procedure that mitigates the bias introduced by an explicit choice for @xmath62 .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by choosing a different day for @xmath62 in evaluating eq.([eqn : fractnr ] ) and we found that the peak moved significantly , consistent with the hypothesis .",

    "the ingaas photodiodes , however , showed evidence for wavelength - independent damage as a result of significant increases in their dark current as the fluence increased .",
    "we used the ara apparatus we developed to measure absolute changes in the responsivity of the ingaas photodiodes .",
    "this investigation was designed to determine whether there was an overall graying of the response of the ingaas photodiodes after radiation exposure . by comparing the ara measurements to simulated experiments constructed from baseline measurements of the ingaas photodiodes before radiation exposure",
