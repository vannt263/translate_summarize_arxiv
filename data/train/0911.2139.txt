    "the non - linear @xmath0 term has been put in evidence with respect to the standard hilbert - einstein term @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the perfect - fluid matter lagrangian .",
    "the field equations are @xmath7    here @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "action ( [ eq : action ] ) can be recast in a scalar - tensor form . by using the conformal scale transformation @xmath10 with @xmath11",
    ", the action can be written in the einstein frame as follows @xcite :    @xmath12    where    @xmath13    the form of @xmath14 is given by solving @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "the transformation @xmath17 induces a coupling of the scalar field @xmath18 with matter .",
    "let us consider now a class of @xmath0 models which do not contain cosmological constant and are explicitly designed to satisfy cosmological and solar - system constraints in given limits of the parameter space . in practice , we choose a class of functional forms of @xmath0 capable of matching , in principle , observational data .",
    "firstly , the cosmological model should reproduce the cmbr constraints in the high - redshift regime ( which agree with the presence of an effective cosmological constant ) .",
    "secondly , it should give rise to an accelerated expansion , at low redshift , according to the @xmath19cdm model .",
    "thirdly , there should be sufficient degrees of freedom in the parameterization to encompass low redshift phenomena ( e.g. the large scale structure ) according to the observations .",
    "finally , small deviations from gr should be consistent with solar system tests .",
    "all these requirements suggest that we can assume the limits @xmath20 which are satisfied by a general class of broken power law models , proposed in @xcite , which are    @xmath21    where parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are constants which should be determined by experimental bounds .",
    "the above model can be constrained at solar system level by considering the ppn formalism .",
    "this approach is extremely important in order to test gravitational theories and to compare them with gr . as it is shown in @xcite",

    ", we have that the gw scalar component is derived considering @xmath27 then we obtain a good sets of parameters for the model @xcite :    * @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 * @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33    such sets of parameters are same as bounds coming from the ppn and some sets reproduce quite well both the ppn upper limits and the constraints on the scalar component amplitude of gws .",

    "the interesting feature , and the main result of this paper , is that such sets of parameters are not in conflict with bounds coming from the cosmological stochastic background of gws . in particular , some sets of parameters reproduce quite well both the ppn upper limits and the constraints on the scalar component amplitude of gws .    far to be definitive , these preliminary results indicate that self - consistent models could be achieved comparing experimental data at very different scales without extrapolating results obtained only at a given scale .",
