    "the energy spectrum of these surface events appears as a continuum that ranges from the full peak energy of the alpha down to the very low energies .",
    "anomalously fast events have been observed in wimp search experiments that use inorganic scintillators , and these have been attributed to the effects of surface alpha ( sa ) events since their rate is seen to be reduced when the detector surfaces are polished  @xcite .",

    "strong alpha - decay peaks can be seen with tails that extend down to zero energy and low lmt10 values . here",
    "one can see that lmt10 values for the low energy tail events are distinctly smaller than those from gamma - ray induced signals .",
    "wimps are expected to scatter elastically from nuclei .",
    "the kims experiment is designed to detect the energy deposited by the recoiling nucleus and uses a pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) analysis to distinguish nuclear recoil events from gamma - induced backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "the presence of surface alpha events at energies below 10 kev , the main region of interest for the dark matter search , complicates the psd analysis .",
    "in order to investigate the characteristics of sa background events , we contaminated the surface of a small sample crystal with   progenies by placing it for four days in a special chamber at the korea research institute of standards and science ( kriss ) in which the   concentration was around 4.33 mbq / m@xmath4 .",

    "the energy loss of a 5304 kev alpha in a 6 @xmath6m - thick aluminum layer is 998 kev ; thus alphas that penetrate the foils still have ample energy to provide a trigger signal .",

    "[ alphapartb ] , the visible energy is the measured energy which differs from the actual energy above around 100 kev because of the saturation effect resulting from the daq system optimized for collecting low energy events .",

    "no corrections for these effects have been applied .",

    "this figure shows the sum of the energies at both crystals has an upper bound , as expected .",
    "the wide spread in the sum of the energies reflects the energy loss in the al foil layers and possible dead layer on the surface of the detector , which depends upon the alpha particle s direction .",

    "the experiment started two months after the radon contamination of the crystal was done and ran for about 3 months .",
    "the rate of events tagged as sa increased with time because of the continuous supply of   from . the event rate became 947 events@xmath7day by the end of the measurement period . from this value ,",

    "the distribution of lmt10 for sa events must be understood in order to distinguish them from dark matter candidate events in kims . for this",
