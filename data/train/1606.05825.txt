    "in a wireless network , transmitters are placed in some configuration and emit signals to users of the system ( e.g. , wi - fi or mobile phone ) .",
    "understanding the spectrum of signal strengths received at a fixed location in such networks is crucial for analysis and design . a main approach to this problem is to study the behavior of the signal spectrum in realistic mathematical models of such networks .",
    "( we use the term signal spectrum to mean the point process of signal strengths ; the exact nature of the signals , e.g. , interference or propagation , is not important to our results . )    due to the increasing prevalence of wireless signal technologies , there is a vast and increasing body of literature devoted to studying key performance metrics derived from the signal spectrum .",
    "a significant thread of this research stems from modeling the positions of transmitters , receivers , or users as points of a random ( typically poisson ) point process , and then computing quantities of interest using the tools of stochastic geometry ; some key references are @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and see also the recent works @xcite @xcite and their references and discussion .",
    "the generally accepted  standard \" model in this setting is that discussed in @xcite ( going back to @xcite @xcite ) where transmitters are placed according to a homogeneous poisson process in the plane  @xmath0 with the receiver at the origin ( justifiable by thinking of the  fixed \" receiver location as being randomly chosen over the area of a large network ) , and the signal strength at the receiver from a transmitter at location @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a non - increasing function representing the deterministic propagation loss of the signal over distance , and the @xmath4 are i.i.d .",
    "positive random variables representing random shadow - fading effects , e.g. , from signals traveling through large obstacles ( shadowing ) and same signal interactions ( multi - path fading ) .",
    "if the poisson transmitter placements are denoted by @xmath5 , then the signal spectrum is just the collection of points @xmath6 .    in the standard model ,",
    "the signal spectrum is easy to understand since basic theory says @xmath7 is a poisson point process on @xmath8 and  @xmath9 is a deterministic function of this point process , hence it is also a poisson point process , now on @xmath10 , with mean measure read from the density of  @xmath11 , the distribution of  @xmath4 , and the function  @xmath12 ( * ? ? ? * ( 2.8 ) of proposition 2.9 ) and c.f .",
    "* lemma  1 ) .",
    "the importance of this result is that if you believe the standard model , then the distribution of the signal spectrum only depends on the mean measure , which can be estimated from the empirical signal spectrum in a number of ways , see @xcite and references there .",
    "the standard model can be generalized to allow for the transmitters to be placed deterministically , such as ( historically and unrealistically ) on a grid , or according to a ( not necessarily poisson ) point process @xcite . in these cases",
    ", the arguments of the previous paragraph do not apply and moreover analytic or numerical computations for quantities of interest are not always feasible .",
    "much work has gone into understanding the signal spectrum for various choices of transmitter configurations , shadow - fading distributions , and propagation loss functions . in general , features of the signal spectrum",
    "may depend on model details , but we can ask : are there some ( weak ) hypotheses on the parameters of the model such that a few measurable quantities approximately determine the distribution of signal strengths ? for the generalized standard model this question has been answered in the affirmative by @xcite where it is shown that if the density of transmitters in the plane is asymptotically regular and the shadow variables are large in mean but small in probability  typically referred to as a  strong \" shadowing regime @xcite  then the spectrum of signal strengths can be well - approximated by a poisson process on @xmath10 with intensity read from the parameters of the model ( this general result built on the work of @xcite where the same thing is shown for a particular family of shadow - fading variables and propagation loss functions ) .",
    "the importance of this result is that under the hypotheses above , the signal spectrum behaves approximately as if the transmitters were placed according to a poisson process and so again , the distribution of the signal spectrum is ( approximately ) determined by the mean measure which can be estimated from the empirical signal spectrum .",
    "having such universal results for the standard model is a positive development ( though there is still work to be done in developing tests for determining when the results of @xcite can be safely applied in practice ) , but there is one serious issue with this story that stems from the standard model itself : it is clearly unrealistic to assume that the shadow - fading variables associated to different transmitters are independent @xcite @xcite",
    ". if two transmitters are close to one another , or close to the same path to the origin , then there should be correlation between the shadowing effects for those transmitters ; see the very nice survey @xcite and references there .",
    "similar to the standard model , there has been much work around studying the signal spectrum for different choices of transmitter configurations , propagation loss functions , and correlation schemes for different shadow - fading variables .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , many of these schemes have fundamental consistency issues and moreover , even where tractable analysis is possible , the behaviour of the signal spectrum under different models can vary considerably .    extrapolating just a bit beyond the summary judgement of @xcite , we argue that the right models to consider in the current climate is that of the generalized standard model with the added feature that the variables @xmath13 are values of a _ log - gaussian field _ with correlation function @xmath14 defined on @xmath15 .",
    "that is , @xmath16 where for any collection of points @xmath17 of  @xmath18 , the vector @xmath19 is centered multivariate gaussian with covariance matrix @xmath20 and  @xmath21 are some parameters .",
    "( this construction is well - defined if  @xmath14 is a symmetric and positive semidefinite function . ) moreover ,  @xmath22 should have a reasonably fast rate of decay in the distance of  @xmath23 and  @xmath24 and ideally will have an angular component accounting for the difference of the angles between the lines from  @xmath23 and  @xmath24 to the origin .",
    "the qualities on  @xmath14 are direct recommendations from @xcite @xcite , and as observed by @xcite , @xcite , modeling the shadowing effects by a log - gaussian field is empirically justified .",
    "we take a first step in generalizing the universality results of @xcite to more realistic models , by extending the results of @xcite to the case where the shadowing variables are correlated . in particular , we show that if in the standard model    * the transmitters are placed according to either 1 ) a deterministic or random pattern with certain regularity conditions , or 2 ) a homogeneous poisson process , * the propagation loss function decays like the norm to the power @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and * the shadow - fading variables satisfy @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and the @xmath29 are generated from a gaussian field with correlation function with reasonable decay to zero and a technical condition given later ( note that the conditions are satisfied by most statistically tractable correlation functions appearing in the literature , reviewed below ) ,    then the signal spectrum converges in distribution to a poisson process with explicit mean measure .",
    "the result of @xcite is precisely the case above with independent shadow variables .",
    "we actually prove much stronger results in theorems  [ thm : mainproc ] and  [ thm : randnumpd2 ] where we provide rates of convergence for this limit theorem in total variation distance and a specialized point process metric .",
    "the rate of convergence quantifies the quality of poisson approximation and we also provide simulations for finite configurations to indicate parameter values where the approximation is good .",
    "there are a number of studies of wireless signal strengths for correlated shadow variables , see references in @xcite , but general results of the type presented here are virtually unprecedented .",
    "perhaps closest to our limit results are those of @xcite where a limit theorem is shown for the _ sum _ of the signal spectrum from a finite ( but large ) collection of transmitters assuming a specific transmitter layout and shadowing correlation function that is much less general than our setting .      in the next section",
    "we define the model more precisely , state our convergence results in greater detail , and discuss their applicability , including a brief overview of relevant correlation functions ( a more significant survey is in appendix  [ sec : updfuncs ] ) . in section  [ sec : simmarg ] we provide simulation results for a finite network where transmitters are placed according to a poisson process and a hexagonal grid and then in section  [ sec : futurework ] we provide a discussion of results and future work .",
    "we precisely state and prove our approximation results in section  [ sec : approxproc ] .",
    "finally in appendix  [ sec : updfuncs ] we survey correlation functions relevant to our results , and appendix  [ sec : proofppp ] contains some technical results , including the proof of a new general poisson point process approximation , theorem  [ thmppp ] .",
    "we first discuss the generalization of the standard model we will use throughout the paper . as is typically done , we actually study @xmath30 , the spectrum of _ inverse _ signal strengths since there tend to be many weak signals which cause the approximating poisson process to have a singularity at zero .",
    "it is convenient to identify countable sets @xmath31 of distinct points with the counting measures @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dirac measure at @xmath24 .",
    "also we identify locally finite measures @xmath34 on @xmath35 with non - decreasing , right - continuous functions @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 , via @xmath38)=\\widetilde{m}(t)$ ] , @xmath39 .    [ setup ]",

    "if the transmitter locations are random , we write @xmath64 in place of @xmath65 and assume that @xmath11 is independent of the gaussian field @xmath45 .",
    "note that ( the cardinality of ) the set @xmath66 is also random , although for most situations it is enough to set @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 has a mean measure @xmath68 , which means that @xmath69 for every bounded borel set @xmath70 .",
    "the signal spectrum @xmath71 is constructed in the same way as above , but based on @xmath11 now instead of @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath72 ; see equation   below .    for deterministic or random transmitters",
    "we assume that @xmath14 and the bounding function @xmath73 have the following properties .    *",
    "( uniform positive definiteness , u.p.d . ) for every @xmath74 there exists a @xmath75 such that for all @xmath76 , for all @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and for all @xmath79 , we have * there is an @xmath80 such that the function @xmath81 is non - increasing for @xmath82 .    except for properties  p1 and  p2 ,",
    "the setup is easily understood from the discussion in the introduction .",
    "property  p2 is satisfied for any reasonable correlation function , and essentially requires that @xmath83 is non - increasing eventually , but is stated in a specific way to simplify the proof of our upcoming results .",
    "the u.p.d .",
    "property  p1 ensures that the spectral norm of the inverse of the covariance matrix induced by the gaussian field observed at any finite subset of points is uniformly upper bounded ( by @xmath84 if the minimal distance is @xmath85 ) .",
    "our method requires that we compare the distribution of @xmath29 to that of @xmath29 given the value of the field at a finite collection of points and this is where the inverse covariance matrix appears , see in the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainproc ] and lemma  [ lem : removingnp ] . in terms of practical applicability ,  p2 is satisfied for a wide choice of isotropic correlation functions , i.e. , @xmath14 of the form @xmath86 , such as any exponential , matrn or gaussian correlation function , as well as certain finite range correlation functions .",
    "it is also satisfied for certain variations of such functions , e.g. , @xmath87 for @xmath88 a regular matrix , or convolutions and convex combinations of such functions . in all of these cases",
    "@xmath89 can be computed explicitly ( at varying cost ) ; see appendix  [ sec : updfuncs ] for further discussion .",
    "property  p1 also resonates well with avoiding numerical problems when applying statistical methods based on wireless network data .",
    "many procedures concerned with statements about the shadowing random field @xmath90 , such as maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters or kriging prediction of its values at unobserved locations involve inverting the correlation matrix @xmath91 of the data @xmath92 .",
    "so for feasability of the procedure it is necessary that @xmath93 is invertible ( i.e. , @xmath14 is strictly positive definite ) . for numerical stability of the procedure , it is important that @xmath93 is well - conditioned , which ( since @xmath93 is a correlation matrix ) amounts essentially to saying that the smallest eigenvalue , i.e. , the maximal @xmath89 in the definition of uniform positive definiteness , is not too close to zero .",
    "further , considering the list of correlation functions used previously in wireless network models given as table  1 in @xcite , after ruling out those functions that are not positive semidefinite ( which do not produce feasible collections of shadowing variables ) , all of the isotropic correlation functions are u.p.d .",
    "with the possible exception of the powered exponential @xmath94 , @xmath95 , which is not well - studied in the literature since it is similar to but less natural than the matrn model because the parameter @xmath96 does not interpolate nicely , e.g. , there is fundamentally different behaviour for @xmath97 than for other @xmath96 . for correlation functions that incorporate both distance and angle , the question of u.p.d .",
    "is not so easily answered and therefore we postpone addressing it to later study .",
    "we study the limit as @xmath98 of @xmath99 and @xmath100 under setup  [ setup ] . for our convergence results , we additionally assume that deterministic transmitter placements  @xmath65 have the asymptotic homogeneity property : for some @xmath101 , and that random placements @xmath11 are homogeneous with intensity @xmath102 : for some @xmath103 and all @xmath104 , where @xmath105 denotes the ( lebesgue ) area of @xmath88 .    under these assumptions , the following result about the mean measure established in @xcite and @xcite , remains obviously valid in our correlated setting .",
    "[ thm : meanlim ] let @xmath65 , @xmath57 , and @xmath106 be defined as in setup  [ setup ] with @xmath65 satisfying  .",
    "then for each @xmath39 , if we replace @xmath65 by a random @xmath11 satisfying  , then for every @xmath28 and each @xmath39 ,    before stating a convergence implication of our main results , we need some terminology to define one of the classes of transmitter configurations we study .",
    "call a point process  @xmath11 a _ hard core process _ with ( minimal ) distance @xmath107 if @xmath108 .",
    "we call a homogeneous point process @xmath11 _ second - order stationary _",
    "if for any bounded borel sets @xmath109 the `` second moments '' @xmath110 are finite and remain the same if we shift the whole point process by an arbitrary vector @xmath111 .",
    "our convergence result for the hard core setting also requires a mild `` @xmath112-mixing '' condition ( existence of a reduced covariance measure with values in @xmath113 ) described in detail around  .",

    "in fact our quantitative approximation results in section  [ sec : approxproc ] show that it is fine to approximate @xmath138 by a poisson process with mean measure given by @xmath34 ( or more realistically , an empirically observed measure ) rather than the limiting @xmath139 of theorem  [ thm : meanlim ] even in the deterministic case .",
    "our approximation theorems below imply that the rates of convergence in @xmath137 for the statements of theorem  [ thm : mainintro ] are polynomial , and in certain cases exponential .",
    "the latter occurs for example in the hard core process case if the decay of the correlation function is exponential .",
    "numerically , our error bounds are quite conservative due to their generality , but they are important for the rates of convergence and because they indicate parameter relationships where the signal spectrum will be close to poisson .    to comment on the three different situations of the theorem , it is not clear what is the most appropriate model for transmitter locations @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "placing transmitters according to a poisson process is tractable and can be heuristically justified by thinking of the user positioned  randomly \" in a large network , but in fact this heuristic is better captured by item  @xmath140 which seems like the most useful model for thinking about robust network architecture .",
    "however , we state all three versions to show that the result and our methods are robust .",
    "the convergence result follows from first deriving approximation bounds in a certain metric @xmath141 between point processes restricted to @xmath142 $ ] , see theorems  [ thm : mainproc ] and  [ thm : randnumpd2 ] , and then use these to show convergence of the restricted point process in @xmath141 , theorems  [ thm : fixprocconv ] and  [ thm : randprocconv ] , and hence also in distribution .",
    "this then implies convergence in distribution of the unrestricted point processes .",
    "to show the approximation bounds , our main tool is stein s method for distributional approximation ; introductions to stein s method from different perspectives are found in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "our needs do not quite fit into existing results for poisson process approximation , so we provide a new general approximation result using stein s method , theorem  [ thmppp ] .",
    "our simulations were run in r @xcite ( using the packages listed in the acknowledgments below ) . we have strived to use parameters that are reasonably realistic in a mobile phone setting without fixating too much on a specific technology or scenario .",
    "our transmitters were placed in two configurations : at the center of the cells of a hexagonal grid and according to a homogeneous poisson process ( resampled for each run of the simulation ) , both on a disc with radius   and having average density @xmath143 . in view of the data analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , noting that the former counted base stations regardless of network operator and technology used , this choice is near the upper limit . for the deterministic propagation loss function",
    "we chose @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which is very similar to the parameters used in @xcite , subsection b5 ; for the choice of @xmath146 see also section  2.6 in @xcite .",
    "a crucial quantity for the quality of approximation is the logarithmic standard deviation of shadowing @xmath137 . in applications",
    "this quantity is customarily expressed as @xmath147 and referred to as @xmath148 , such that @xmath149 .",
    "typical values for @xmath148 from empirical studies range from 4 to ; see section  2.7 in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite values from 8 to are considered .",
    "we use , which translates to @xmath150 .",
    "we choose for @xmath14 the exponential correlation function , i.e. , @xmath151 , which has been often used in the literature before .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath152 is known as _",
    "decorrelation distance _ in this context and often takes values between 50 and , corresponding to the order of magnitude of typical obstacles ; see subsection  vi.b in @xcite and the references given there .",
    "we chose @xmath153 , the last value to also include a setting where correlation is stronger than might be usual .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we implicitly normalize signal strengths to multiples of a constant transmitter power @xmath154 , whereas the _ absolute _ received signal strengths from a transmitter at location @xmath23 would be @xmath155 . in view of the rather high transmitter density , we choose @xmath156 , which is a realistic power for a small cell , but too low for a macrocell .",
    "however , with this choice we obtain realistic strongest signal strengths in the range of mostly to ( i.e. , @xmath157 to @xmath158 ) at the receiver .",
    "note that other choices of @xmath154 or @xmath159 will just result in scaling the received powers , but not in any other way alter the outcomes .",
    "for the simulation study we generate @xmath160 realizations of the signal spectrum and compute the count statistics for the number of signals ( reciprocals of the powers in ) falling in the interval @xmath142 $ ] , where @xmath161 .",
    "this corresponds to counting signals with power at least @xmath162 , respectively , at the receiver .",
    "the outcome is summarized in table  [ table : ppphexsim ] .",
    "the first row of the table records the theoretical numerically computed mean values  @xmath163 for transmitters placed according to a poisson process , while the second and third row are the empirical mean and variance of @xmath164 for this case .",
    "the fourth and fifth row of values are the empirical mean and variance for the hexagonal transmitter arrangement .",
    "figures  [ fig : cdfppp ] and  [ fig : cdfhex ] show the empirical cdf of @xmath164 for poisson process and hexagonal transmitter placement , respectively , plotted against the appropriate poisson cdf for @xmath165 ( p - p plot ) .    in figure  [",
    "fig : cdfppp ] we notice , as expected , that with increasing scale @xmath152 of the correlation the approximation becomes worse .",
    "note that for @xmath166 ( no correlation ) it would be clear by the poisson process transformation theorem that the signal counts follow the exact poisson distribution ( and correspondingly also satisfy mean@xmath167variance with regard to table  [ table : ppphexsim ] ) ; see lemma  1 in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath168 the approximation is still very close to exact .",
    "with increasing @xmath152 it deviates towards a more and more overdispersed distribution , as can be seen from the `` flipped s''-shape in the plots and from the high variances in table  [ table : ppphexsim ] .",
    "having an overdispersed distribution corresponds well to the intuition that under strongly positively correlated shadowing , we get clusters of signals in our interval @xmath142 $ ] and thus higher probabilities for both very low and very high counts . in such situations the signal spectrum",
    "for the given @xmath137 may be better approximated by a poisson cluster process or a more general cox process ; see @xcite .",
    "turning now to figure  [ fig : cdfhex ] , we notice that for smaller @xmath152 the signal counts are underdispersed as seen from the `` proper s''-shape in the plots .",
    "only for @xmath169 we are in the situation of overdispersed signal counts again .",
    "the same is reflected in the relations of means and variances in table  [ table : ppphexsim ] .",
    "the underdispersion of signals at smaller @xmath152 can be attributed to the regularity of the hexagonal grid and the fact that in view of the limit theorem the @xmath137 considered is too small .",
    "this is partly compensated by the correlated shadowing , and as @xmath152 becomes larger , the shadowing effect takes over .",
    "what is remarkable is that for correlated shadowing , there is an intermediate range of parameter settings ( that are more or less realistic for a mobile network context ) in which the poisson approximation for the signal spectrum in the hexagonal configuration is actually more accurate than in the case of transmitters distributed according to a poisson process .",
    "we see from the above considerations that the difference between the mean and the variance read from  table  [ table : ppphexsim ] is a useful proxy for the quality of poisson approximation .",
    "further analysis ( not presented here ) shows as expected that approximation gets better as @xmath137 increases , but worse as @xmath170 increases beyond the values given in the table ; see also @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the spectrum of signal strengths in a wireless network with moderately correlated strong shadowing is well approximated by a poisson point process , generalizing the same result for the uncorrelated case .",
    "this holds true under a wide choice of probability distributions for the transmitter point process , in particular for virtually any second - order stationary distribution that includes a hard core , i.e.  holds the transmitters at a minimal distance from each other .",
    "note that cellular networks would usually be designed to hold transmitters serving overlapping areas a certain distance apart .",
    "alternatively such transmitters would operate at different frequencies to keep interference at a tolerable level , with frequencies being reused many times at transmitters that are somewhat farther apart ; see @xcite , chapter  15 .",
    "this means that even in networks where transmitters are strongly clustered , our theorem should still be valid if applied to the strengths of signals received at a certain frequency .",
    "we have provided a first simulation study for our result using appropriate model parameters for a mobile phone setting .",
    "this study indicates that the poisson process limit can become relevant for realistic correlation settings if @xmath137 is reasonably high ( @xmath171 or above ) .",
    "it is an important avenue for future research to determine the applicability of our result more closely using data available from given networks , and to investigate its robustness across different scenarios .",
    "the importance of our result comes from the fact that in networks where it is applicable , we can essentially treat the signal spectrum as an inhomogeneous poisson process , which is a point process that is well understood and relatively easy to handle .",
    "in particular , it is completely determined by its mean measure , which then can be estimated from the empirical spectrum in a number of ways .",
    "also it has a number of important derived quantities that are mathematically tractable , such as coverage probabilities ; see e.g.  @xcite and the references in its introduction .",
    "some important questions related to our work that we leave open for future study are    1 .",
    "we expect our results to extend beyond the lognormal shadow - fading setting to shadow variables that are other functions of the value of a gaussian field at the transmitter location in a similar way as @xcite generalizes @xcite in the independent case .",
    "we have not taken into account fast - fading effects , which are frequently modelled by multiplying the shadow variable by another non - negative random variable , independent between transmitters . apart from the fact that additional computations are necessary to adapt our proofs to the new distributions of shadowing and fading combined , we expect that the fast - fading effects would only help the poisson convergence by adding a discontinuity in the correlation function at zero .",
    "3 .   to confidently apply our results in practice",
    ", it would be good to develop simple statistical tests to determine when the hypotheses of strong shadowing under moderate correlation are satisfied ; in particular to conclude when it is appropriate to assume the signal spectrum is approximately poisson .",
    "note that the analogous question assuming independent shadowing is not even well - addressed .",
    "many times we are interested in functions of the signal spectrum such as the signal - to - interference ratio .",
    "understanding such statistics via our results would be useful .",
