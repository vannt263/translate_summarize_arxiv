    "the study of the properties of strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( ) @xcite is one of the most investigated research topics in recent years .",
    "the interest is fueled on the one hand by direct experimental questions related to the properties of produced at and on the other hand by the possibility of studying analytically the non - perturbative properties of plasmas in various , mostly supersymmetric , gauge theories using the /correspondence @xcite .",
    "although there does not exist so far a direct counterpart of the plasma , the study of exact properties of similar systems not based on _ ad - hoc _ phenomenological models may increase our understanding of the properties of the plasma .",
    "this hope has been substantiated , e.g. , by the discovery of a universal strong coupling shear viscosity to entropy ratio , which is valid for a wide range of different gauge theories @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been initially undertaken for a static plasma system with a fixed constant temperature .",
    "after the earliest investigations of transport coefficients various other observables have been discussed related to the properties of fundamental flavors in the thermal medium such as drag force calculations @xcite , jet - quenching @xcite , meson spectrum @xcite , meson melting @xcite , thermodynamics of fundamental flavors @xcite .    on the other hand , since the experimentally produced plasma is always a non - static expanding system , it was tempting to extend the /investigations to such a time - dependent dynamical setting .",
    "qualitative duals for thermalization and cooling have been suggested in @xcite , a quantitative framework for studying boost - invariant expansion of a plasma system in @xmath0 has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "subsequent work within this framework include @xcite , which concentrated on the details of the dynamics of the expanding plasma in _ pure _ @xmath0 theory .    the main motivation for this work was to bring together the two lines of investigation and to study an expanding plasma in the @xmath0 theory with fundamental flavors .",
    "the flavor system is represented by an embedding of a d7 brane in the dual geometry of the expanding plasma , which is  in an essential way  time - dependent .",
    "such time - dependent embeddings have not been considered so far in the literature on flavor systems . in this paper",
    "we would like to concentrate on the features of the system that are the direct analogues of the corresponding properties studied in the static case .",
    "in particular we find the ( time - dependent ) embedding , we find the time - dependence of the chiral condensate including leading viscosity effects and we describe the behavior of mesonic modes in the scalar and vector channels .",
    "finally we perform a holographic renormalization of the d7 action density .",
    "we will show that the chiral condensate , meson spectra and action density are compatible with the adiabatic approximation , i.e.  their leading contribution agrees with the result obtained from the static ads / blackhole by navely assuming bjorken scaling .    as a word of caution",
    "let us emphasize that the gauge theory that we are considering does not exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking so from this point of view differs substantially from .",
    "however , since this is the first investigation of a flavor system in an expanding plasma , we chose to deal with the simplest theoretical setting , which is the only system for which the dual expanding geometry is known so far .",
    "ultimately one would like to extend these investigations to theories that exhibit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we will first review some basic facts about viscous hydrodynamics from field theory perspective and its implementation in /.",
    "in the next section we will perturbatively determine the time - dependent embedding of a d7 brane in that geometry and determine the chiral quark condensate .",
    "thereafter , we determine meson spectra from fluctuations about the embedding . moreover , we give the regularized d7 action and show that it is again compatible with expectations from adiabatic considerations .",
    "an interesting kinematical regime of the expanding plasma is the so - called central rapidity region .",
    "there , as was suggested by bjorken @xcite , one assumes that the system is invariant under longitudinal boosts .",
    "this assumption is in fact commonly used in realistic hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",
    "if in addition we assume no dependence on transverse coordinates ( a limit of infinitely large nuclei ) the dynamics simplifies enormously .    in order to study boost - invariant plasma configurations",
    "it is convenient to pass from minkowski coordinates @xmath1 to proper - time / spacetime rapidity ones @xmath2 through @xmath3 the object of this work is to describe the spacetime dependence of the energy - momentum tensor of a boost - invariant plasma in @xmath0 theory at strong coupling .",
    "the symmetries of the problem reduce the number of independent components of @xmath4 to three .",
    "energy - momentum conservation @xmath5 and tracelessness @xmath6 allows to express all components in terms of just a single function ",
    "the energy density @xmath7 in the local rest frame .",
    "explicitly we have @xcite @xmath8 gauge theory dynamics should now pick out a definite function @xmath7 .",
    "the object of a hydrodynamic model is to determine the spacetime dependence of the energy - momentum tensor for an expanding ( plasma ) system .",
    "the simplest dynamical assumption is that of a perfect fluid .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the energy momentum has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the local 4-velocity of the fluid ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the energy density and @xmath13 is the pressure . in the case of @xmath0 theory",
    "that we consider here @xmath6 and hence @xmath14 .",
    "the equation of motion that one obtains from energy conservation in the boost - invariant setup is @xmath15 whose solution is the celebrated bjorken result @xmath16 once one wants to include dissipative effects coming from shear viscosity , the description becomes more complex . in a first approximation one",
    "adds to the perfect fluid tensor a dissipative contribution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the shear viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the resulting equations of motion get modified to @xmath19 note that in the above equation the shear viscosity is generically temperature dependent ( @xmath20 in the @xmath0 case ) and hence @xmath21 dependent . in order to have a closed system of equations we have to incorporate this dependence through @xmath22 with @xmath23 being some numerical coefficient . the resulting energy density",
    "satisfying gets modified from to @xmath24      in @xcite the program of perturbatively determining the dual geometry to the viscous hydrodynamic model discussed in the previous section was carried out .",
    "the non - compact part of the metric takes the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 the holographic direction .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is related to the fourth order term of @xmath27 expanded in @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 of course it is too difficult to perform this construction for arbitrary functions @xmath7 . what has been performed in practice",
    "is an expansion of @xmath7 for ( large ) proper - times @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "each subsequent term in the expansion can then be determined by requiring regularity of the square of the riemann tensor order - by - order . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in order to study the large proper - time limit of the metric one is led to introduce a scaling variable @xmath29 and take the limit @xmath30 with @xmath31 fixed .",
    "for the discussion of subleading terms in the metric an expansion around this limit was performed , @xmath32 and similarly for the other coefficients .",
    "the leading and first subleading coefficients are given by    @xmath33    @xmath23 is an undetermined integration constant ( which has the physical interpretation as the coefficient of shear viscosity ) .",
    "it can be fixed from non - singularity of the metric ; the resulting value @xmath34 is in accord with the known viscosity coefficient of @xmath0 , @xmath35 , calculated in the static case @xcite .    from the leading order terms in , using the similarity with the static black hole metric , we may read off the temperature from the position of the horizon . as discussed in @xcite , to this order , the result @xmath36\\ ] ] is compatible with the stefan  boltzmann law .",
    "this can be explicitly checked by extracting the energy density from the metric expanded in the scaling limit up to @xmath37 through ( [ e.epsa ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 which is consistent with viscous hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "conventional /  describes @xmath0 theory , which has only fields in the adjoint representation , since all fields sit in the same supermultiplet containing the gauge field .",
    "a standard method @xcite for the introduction of quenched matter into the correspondence is by adding probe d7 branes . strings stretching between the probe and the original d3 stack generating the @xmath39 background give rise to an @xmath40 hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation .",

    "manifestly , the d7 brane breaks the @xmath48 symmetry of the internal manifold to @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 symmetry in the 8,9-plane can be used to rotate the embedding of the d7 to @xmath51 such that one scalar field is sufficient for a complete description of the embedding .",
