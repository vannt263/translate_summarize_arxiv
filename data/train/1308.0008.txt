    "the concept of pseudo - spin ( p - spin ) and spin symmetries in nucleon and antinucleon , respectively , introduced to reveal the dynamical nature of quantum systems and these symmetries play a critical role in the shell structure and its evolution . within the framework of dirac equation ,",

    "later it was found that spin and p - spin are exact @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , under a less strict condition and to what extent the spin and p - spin are conserved are related to the competition between the centrifugal barrier and the spin or p - spin orbital potential @xcite .",

    "we intend to investigate the trigonometric pschl - teller ( tpt ) potential proposed for the first time by pschl and teller @xcite in 1933 was to describe the diatomic molecular vibration .",

    "the goal of the present work is to extend previous works @xcite to the relativistic case , @xmath33 ( rotational case ) and also in the presence of a coulomb - like tensor potential via the asymptotic iteration method @xcite .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we briefly introduce aim method . in section [ sec3 ] , in view of spin and p - spin symmetries , we briefly introduce the dirac equation with scalar and vector tpt potentials plus a coulomb - like tensor interaction for arbitrary spin - orbit quantum number . in section [ sec4 ] , the approximate energy eigenvalue equations and corresponding two - component wave functions of the dirac - tpt problem including tensor interaction",

    "in spherical coordinates , the dirac equation for fermonic massive spin@xmath48 particles interacting with arbitrary scalar potential s(r ) , the time - component @xmath6 of a four - vector potential and the tensor potential @xmath49 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath50\\psi(\\vec{r})=[e - v(r)]\\psi(\\vec{r } ) , \\label{e6}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the relativistic energy of the system , the momentum operator and mass of the particle respectively . @xmath26 and @xmath54 are @xmath55 dirac matrices given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 unitary matrix and @xmath59 are the three - vector pauli spin matrices .",

    "thus , the spinor wave functions can be classified according to their angular momentum @xmath14 , the spin - orbit quantum number @xmath1 and the radial quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "hence , they can be written as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the radial wave functions of the upper- and lower - spinor components respectively and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the spherical harmonic functions coupled to the total angular momentum @xmath14 and it s projection @xmath73 on the @xmath74 axis .",

    "in this section , we present the approximate bound state solutions of the dirac equation with the tpt potential in the presence of the tensor interaction using the aim .",
    "it is clearly seen that equation ( [ e14 ] ) is not analytically solvable because of the coupling term .",
    "we therefore must include an approximation to deal with the coupling term .",
    "it is found that for short range potential , the following formula is a good approximation to the coupling term @xcite : @xmath115 by inserting approximation expression ( [ e19 ] ) and introducing a new variable of the form @xmath116 into equation ( [ e14 ] ) , we can easily find @xmath117 now we reach a position that the differential equation is appropriate for applying aim .",
    "therefore equation ( [ e20 ] ) should have a solution in the form of normalized wave functions which should respect the boundary conditions that is @xmath118 at @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 at @xmath122 for @xmath123 . as a result",
