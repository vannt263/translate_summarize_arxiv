    "this result is anticipated within the effective theory , since short - distance two - body currents are suppressed by three powers of @xmath39 relative to leading in @xmath10 , but are down by two additional powers of @xmath39 in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "deuteron static properties are also well reproduced , although @xmath46 shows significant variability when different assumptions about deuteron short - distance physics are made .",
    "this may be associated with the `` @xmath46-puzzle '' : the inability of modern potential models to reproduce the experimental value for this quantity  @xcite .",
    "any possible resolution of this puzzle within the nuclear effective theory will require the computation of higher - order effects in @xmath86 , including two - pion - exchange contributions to the deuteron four - current .",
