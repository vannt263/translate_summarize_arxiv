    "instabilities of the normal metallic state lead to a rich variety of quantum phase transitions in interacting electron systems . near a quantum critical point electronic excitations are strongly scattered by order parameter fluctuations such that fermi liquid theory breaks down.@xcite the fluctuation effects and the ensuing non - fermi liquid behavior is particularly pronounced in two - dimensional systems .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that quantum critical fluctuations are frequently invoked as a mechanism for the enigmatic strange metal behavior observed in cuprate superconductors and other layered correlated electron compounds .",
    "theoretical works have mostly focused on the quantum critical point and its extension into the quantum critical regime at finite temperature , where quantum fluctuations are particularly important .",
    "less attention has been paid to the _ ginzburg region _ near the critical temperature , which is characterized by strongly interacting classical order parameter fluctuations.@xcite this is somewhat unwarranted since classical critical fluctuations also affect electronic excitations very strongly . in two dimensions",
    "they lead to a contribution of the order @xmath2 to the quasi - particle decay rate , where @xmath3 is the diverging correlation length.@xcite    in this paper we compute the size of the ginzburg region above the critical temperature near a quantum critical point in two - dimensional metals .",
    "more specifically , we consider continuous quantum phase transitions associated with the spontaneous breaking of a _ discrete _ symmetry , described by an effective hertz action @xcite for a scalar order parameter with dynamical exponents @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate the transition temperature @xmath0 as a function of the non - thermal control parameter for the quantum phase transition , as well as the ginzburg temperature @xmath1 above @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the ginzburg region @xmath6 is determined to leading order in the distance from the quantum critical point .",
    "the dependence of the ginzburg temperature on the control parameter was derived already by millis.@xcite however , that study did not access the ginzburg region between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of all finite temperature transition and crossover lines in dimensions @xmath7 was performed by sachdev .",
    "@xcite for discrete symmetry breaking in two dimensions the critical temperature @xmath0 and the ginzburg temperature below @xmath0 were recently compared within a renormalization group study which allowed to approach the finite temperature transition.@xcite however , in that work the flow equations were solved only numerically , while we now present analytic results .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the renormalization group equations for the effective hertz action .",

    "we do not address the issue under which circumstances the hertz action provides a faithful description of quantum criticality in two - dimensional metals.@xcite    before embarking on the renormalization group approach , we would like to emphasize that in two dimensions @xmath14 can not be obtained from a first order expansion in the quartic coupling @xmath15 , even if it is weak and irrelevant at the quantum critical point .",
    "to leading order in @xmath15 , the inverse susceptibility @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a positive constant . at finite temperature",
    "the matsubara frequencies are discrete and the classical fluctuation contribution from @xmath19 diverges logarithmically in the limit @xmath20 in two dimensions . trying to treat this divergence by a self - consistent equation , replacing @xmath21 by @xmath16 under the integral , one finds that the transition temperature @xmath0 is suppressed to zero at the critical point given by @xmath22 , irrespective of @xmath21 .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the mermin - wagner theorem , which excludes spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "however , the above first order calculation is essentially independent of the symmetry of the order parameter , and is therefore misleading at least in the case of a discrete symmetry .",
    "we solve the problem by using flow equations which describe the renormalization of the inverse susceptibility ( or  mass  ) @xmath16 and the quartic coupling @xmath23 due to fluctuations .",
