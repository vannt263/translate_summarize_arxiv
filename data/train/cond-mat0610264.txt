    "the general scheme of the thermokinetic approach is described in the references @xcite .",
    "the method consists in defining the state of the system with a set of the relevant extensive variables , say @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is , e.g. the densities of particles in the sub - system @xmath13 , or equivalently , the density of component @xmath13 of a multicomponent fluid , and @xmath0 is the total entropy density .",
    "the conservation equations should then be written , and the two laws of thermodynamics applied .",

    "it is proportional to the inverse of the relaxation time @xmath21 ( see appendix a ) . physically , the term @xmath16 describes the relaxation process that changes the internal degree of freedom ( e.g. spins , electric charges , internal configuration ) . in terms of chemical reactions",

    "the summation over all sub - systems , or all components of the fluid is that of a conserved variable : @xmath24 .",
    "the same holds , of course , for the energy @xmath25 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the flux of energy .",
    "in contrast , the entropy production of the total system is not conservative in general , due to the irreversible processes ( in other terms , information is lost ) .",
    "the equation for the entropy production of the whole system takes the canonical form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the flux of entropy , and @xmath30 is the internal entropy production , or _",

    "as will be shown in the last section , this term is responsible for the irreversible spin - transfer effect described in this work .",
    "what is unusual in dealing with the second law , is to manipulate an inequality instead of an equality , and consequently to deal with sufficient conditions instead of equivalences . here , the condition @xmath31 leads to a positive matrix @xmath43 of onsager - casimir transport coefficients that are state functions of the variables @xmath44 , in order to build a positive quadratic form .",
    "the condition is fulfilled if the flux @xmath45 and the relaxation velocity @xmath46 have the form    @xmath47    where    @xmath48    is the chemical affinity of the corresponding reaction @xmath18 ( and we have @xmath49 ) @xcite . furthermore , due to the time reversal symmetry of the microscopic equations , the transport coefficients follow the onsager - casimir reciprocity relations @xcite .",
    "the cross - coefficients that couple the flux @xmath50 to the relaxation process @xmath7 are assumed to be zero , because , according to the curie principle , only processes of identical tensorial nature are coupled .",

    "what we gain in performing this analysis is to identify clearly the conservative and dissipative flux ( through the internal entropy production ) , and to be able to define a dissipative process that couples the sub - systems beyond the usual deterministic coupling ( electric field , magnetic field , pressure , etc  ) .",
    "this dissipative coupling appears with an additional transport coefficient @xmath9 , defined univocally via the transport equations . in the case",
    "studied below , the matrix @xmath55 is composed by theconductivities @xmath56 associated to each channel ( i.e. associated to a given electronic population ) , the thermal conductivity , or the corresponding seebeck ( thermoelectric power ) and peltier coefficients @xcite and the ferromagnetic transport coefficients : gyromagnetic ratio @xmath57 and the gilbert damping coefficient @xmath58 . beyond",
    ", the flux of entropy or heat allows the _ spin transfer _ to be understood in an open system in terms of relaxation with a supplementary onsager coefficient @xmath9 . as shown in the last section , this term is responsible for an effective temperature @xmath59 and effective ( negative ) damping @xmath60 .",
    "the model is based on the hypothesis that the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath61 is well differentiated from the sub - system composed by spin - polarized conduction electrons , although both systems exchange charges , spins , and heat through a relaxation mechanism that will be described in terms of internal variables @xcite . as shown above",
    ", the relaxation of an internal variable ( or internal degree of freedom ) defines a transport coefficient @xmath62 related to the corresponding relaxation time @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , see appendix a for the relation to the relaxation time ) .",
    "we hence start with the two sub - systems : the ferromagnet described by the magnetization @xmath61 and the two conducting spin - channel system of the conduction electrons .",
    "both sub - systems are dynamically coupled through the relaxation time @xmath63 .",
    "this relaxation is qualified as interband relaxation , to be opposed to the intraband spin - flip relaxation @xmath65 introduced in the usual two spin - channel approximation .",
    "the conducting channels are usually described by the density @xmath66 of conduction electrons with spin up and the density @xmath67 of conduction electrons with spin down .",
    "the intraband coupling ( accounted for by @xmath68 or @xmath65 ) is responsible for the spin - accumulation mechanism at stationary regime . for convenience",
    ", we redefine the two channels with the density of spin - polarized electrons @xmath69 ( `` spin conduction channel '' ) and the total density of electrons @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the conduction channels are contacted to a power supply ( current generator here ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the magnetic system is also contacted to the power supply , e.g. through the electron of @xmath1 character @xcite .",
    "the conduction electrons are thermalized each - other through a well - known mechanism of elastic scattering @xmath71 ( that defines the conduction electron reservoir ) , at the femto - second time scales ( or below ) , and are also contacted to the lattice through the fermi - dirac distribution , and inelastic scattering @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ferromagnetic order parameter is contacted to the lattice with a well - known relaxation time @xmath73 that is measured in ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments , and is typically of the order of the nanosecond ( or few hundreds of picoseconds ) .",
    "this description leads to the model depicted in fig 1(b ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     assuming that the mechanism responsible for @xmath59 is the spin - accumulation occurring at the interface composed of antialigned ferromagnets , the voltage drop due to spin - accumulation is approximatively equal to @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) ) :    @xmath74    with @xmath75 the proportionality between @xmath76 and @xmath77 was observed by different groups in recent experimental investigations @xcite ( with dc measurements , the parameter is the `` critical current '' @xmath78 as shown in fig .",
    "[ nb ] ( d ) ) .    how to estimate the magnetic energy of the spin - accumulation system in usual experimental situations , where a current density of some few ma is injected in the nanostructure @xcite ?",
    "this current corresponds to some @xmath79 spin per seconds flowing through the interface .",
    "if one assumes that 20 % ( polarization of the current ) of the spins are maintained out - of - equilibrium within a typical relaxation time @xmath65 of @xmath80 , we are left with about @xmath81 spins that define the magnetization of the spin - accumulation sub - system in the volume defined by the corresponding diffusion length .",
    "an effect of the electric spin relaxation on the ferromagnetic order parameter should consequently be expected for a nanostructured ferromagnetic system that is only ten to hundred times larger . in an internal field of @xmath82 t , this energy @xmath83 is of the order 1 ev ( beyond the curie temperature ) in accordance with activation experiments performed on various systems @xcite . without current injection , the magnetic order parameter is at room temperature and consequently , the hot sub - system is the spin - accumulation system .",
    "an unified thermokinetics approach of both spin - dependent charge carriers and ferromagnetic brownian motion has been presented in the context of open systems .",
    "the spin - dependent electronic relaxation is then introduced as a source term in the conservation equation of the magnetic moment .",
    "this leads to the description of the effect of spin - injection induced magnetization switching , or irreversible spin - transfer in an open ferromagnetic layer .",
    "the description of the spin - accumulated charge carriers is based on the two conduction channel approximation , generalized to both intra -and inter- band relaxation .",
    "the application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics , together with the conservation laws , lead to the spin - dependent transport equations .",
    "the relevant onsager transport coefficients are introduced and related to the typical electronic relaxation times . the effect of charge conservation and screening",
    "is also taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , the ferromagnetic order parameter is described on an equal footing by introducing the conservation laws and the relevant chemical potential , with deterministic terms accounting for the effective field , and dissipative terms accounting for the coupling to a relevant heat bath .",
    "the corresponding onsager transport coefficients are defined with the second law of thermodynamics , and refined with the help of the onsager reciprocal relations .",
    "the rotational fokker - planck equation , and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation are then derived within the thermokinetic theory .",
    "the onsager coefficients are related to the typical time scales of the ferromagnetic relaxation ( @xmath73 ) . in the activation regime ,",
    "the nel - brown activation law is deduced .    in the framework of this description , the generalization of both the fokker - planck equation and the llg equation with adding the contribution of spin - accumulation is straightforward in terms of flux of representative points in the magnetization sphere .",
    "the negative damping appears naturally in order to describe the exchange of spins from the electric subsystem to the magnetic sub - system , described as a coupling to an environment .",
    "furthermore , the discussion about the different relaxation times shows that the spin - polarized current is not thermalized to the lattice in the stationary regime , but is thermalized with the spin - accumulation sub - system .",
    "the argument is that on one hand the relaxation toward equilibrium of the spin - accumulation system ( described by @xmath65 : some tens to hundreds of picoseconds ) is shorter than the thermalization of the ferromagnetic system ( described by @xmath73 : nanoseconds ) . and",
    "on the other hand , the coupling between the ferromagnetic order parameter and the spin - accumulation sub - system ( @xmath63 ) is shorter or equal to the @xmath65 .",
    "an effective temperature is then derived in the activation regime through the entropy production , and leads to the derivation of an effective nel - brown relaxation process due to current injection , that is experimentally observed .",
    "we are indebted to prof .",
    "peter levy for the constant interest along this work and for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "let us consider a simple interface between two metals .",
    "far from the interface , the ohm s law is recovered : the chemical potentials of the channels are identical and the electric distribution is that of equilibrium @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the following , we assume that the charge transfer between the two channels can be described by the following relation :    @xmath86    the case @xmath87 describes the local electrical neutrality .",

    "<S> spin - transfer is a typical spintronics effect that allows a ferromagnetic layer to be switched by spin - injection . </S>",
    "<S> most of the experimental results about spin transfer ( quasi - static hysteresis loops or ac resonance measurements ) are described on the basis of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation of the magnetization , in which additional current - dependent damping factors are added , and can be positive or negative . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the damping can be investigated further by performing stochastic experiments , like one shot relaxation experiments under spin - injection in the activation regime of the magnetization . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the nel - brown activation law is observed which leads to the introduction of a current - dependent effective temperature . in order to justify the introduction of these counterintuitive parameters ( effective temperature and negative damping ) , </S>",
    "<S> a detailed thermokinetic analysis of the different sub - systems involved is performed . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a thermokinetic description of the different forms of energy exchanged between the electric and the ferromagnetic sub - systems at a normal / ferromagnetic junction .    </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the fokker - planck equation in the framework of the thermokinetic theory allows the damping parameters to be defined from the entropy variation and refined with the onsager reciprocity relations and symmetry properties of the magnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the spin - polarized current is introduced as an external source term in the conservation laws of the ferromagnetic layer . due to the relaxation time separation </S>",
    "<S> , this contribution can be reduced to an effective damping </S>",
    "<S> . the flux of energy transferred between the ferromagnet and the spin - polarized current can be positive or negative , depending on spin accumulation configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature is deduced in the activation ( stationary ) regime , providing that the relaxation time that couples the magnetization to the spin - polarized current is shorter than the relaxation to the lattice .    in the context of spintronics , </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistance of magnetic nanostructures are tuned with the magnetization states . </S>",
    "<S> giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) , or anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) allow the magnetization states of nano - layers to be measured with great precision . </S>",
    "<S> such magnetoresistances are easily scalable reading processes and are used for magnetic sensors and random access memorie ( mram ) technology . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of controlling the magnetic configuration of a magnetic nanostructure by injecting spins emerged only in recent studies , opening the way to a readily scalable writing process for mrams application . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is also extended to thermally assisted switching , in which the heat fluxes are also exploited in order to help the magnetization reversal . in order to control the magnetic configurations and their stabilities ( for reading and writing processes ) , in such magnetic nanopillars , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to understand on one hand the processes responsible for the magnetization reversal ( in the presence of a magnetic field and heat ) , and on the other hand , the processes governing spin - dependent electronic transport at normal / ferromagnetic interfaces . taken separately , both effects are rather well understood today . </S>",
    "<S> however , coupling the two processes leads one to consider a large variety of possible mechanisms , called spin - transfer , that involve an ensemble of non - equilibrium sub - systems in interaction , with different populations of electrons and different populations of spins . </S>",
    "<S> the present work tries to clarify this picture with a phenomenological analysis based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics of open systems .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetization reversal provoked by spin injection has been observed in magnetic nanostructures of various morphologies , from spin - valve multilayers @xcite to nanowires @xcite or point contacts @xcite , and different types of magnetic domain walls @xcite . in order to describe and interpret these observations , physicists where forced to add one or two current - dependent terms into the well - known dynamical equations that describe a ferromagnetic layer coupled to a heat bath ( fokker - planck or corresponding landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the question remains open about the deterministic ( e.g. spin - torque ) or stochastic ( e.g. irreversible ) nature of the terms to be added .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that for a time window larger than the nanosecond time scale , and in the framework of one - shot measurements ( i.e. non - averaged , or irreversible measurements ) , the magnetization reversal induced by spin - injection is an activated process , with two level fluctuations @xcite or simple irreversible jumps @xcite . in these experiments , governed by stochastic fluctuations and noise , </S>",
    "<S> the observed effect is accounted for by a current dependent effective temperature in the nel - brown activation law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for quasi - static measurements ( e.g. magnetoresistance measured as a function of the magnetic field or current with dc systems or lock - in detection system ) and for high frequency measurements , oscillations and resonances indicate , in the frequency domain , the manifestation of quasi - ballistic precession effects @xcite . in these last experiments , the stochastic nature of the signal </S>",
    "<S> is averaged out , and the behavior is described in terms of current dependent negative damping within a generalized landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> this negative damping formulation is motivated by the pioneering works of berger @xcite and slonczewski @xcite about the deterministic spin transfer torque theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the deterministic approach can not directly account for the magnetic relaxation measurements performed in the activation regime ( as discussed in sec . </S>",
    "<S> iv - a below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of the slonczewski s spin - torque ( presented as a current - dependent deterministic term in the microscopic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ) is not useful as such in the description proposed here , i.e. in the context of open systems .    in order to justify the introduction of the counterintuitive phenomenological parameters ( effective temperature and negative damping ) , a detailed analysis of the different sub - systems </S>",
    "<S> is performed on the basis of thermokinetic theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first step ( first section below ) is to identify the relevant sub - systems of interest ( pointing out the difference between the spin - accumulation due to the diffusion of spin - dependent conduction electrons at an interface , and the magnetization of a ferromagnetic layer ) , the coupling between them , and the role of microscopic degree of freedom that will be reduced to the action of the environment . in section two , </S>",
    "<S> spin - injection and spin - dependent transport are described in the framework of the two spin - channel approximation ( a conduction channel that carries spin up and a conduction channel that carries spin down , defined by the conductivities ) . </S>",
    "<S> giant magnetoresistance , spin - accumulation , and corresponding entropy production , or heat transfer , are deduced . beyond the two spin channel approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is extended to four channels with the introduction of two other electronic populations ( typically @xmath0-like for conduction electrons , and @xmath1-like for the ferromagnetic order parameter ) and the relaxation between them . in the same manner as spin - flip scattering coupled the spin - up and spin - down channels </S>",
    "<S> , this relaxation defines a dissipative coupling between the ferromagnet and the spin - dependent electric sub - systems . </S>",
    "<S> the third section is devoted to the detailed description of the ferromagnetic order parameter coupled to a heat bath ( without spin - injection ) . </S>",
    "<S> both the rotational fokker - planck equation and the corresponding llg equation are derived in the framework of the thermokinetic theory , i.e. with the help of the first two laws of thermodynamics and the onsager reciprocity relations only . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the ferromagnetic order parameter to the heat bath is introduced via the chemical potential with a typical maxwell - boltzmann diffusion term including the temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nel - brown law is deduced in the activation regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the last section is devoted to the ferromagnetic brownian motion activated by spin - injection . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the spin - polarized current is introduced by the @xmath2 like relaxation , as a source term into the conservation laws of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , it is shown that if @xmath3 is the density of magnetic moments oriented in a given direction @xmath4 of the unit sphere , and @xmath5 is the corresponding flux of magnetic moments ( this flux is not a displacement in the usual space ) , the conservation of @xmath3 writes : @xmath6 , where the divergence is defined on the sphere and @xmath7 is the relaxation rate , integrated through the normal - ferromagnetic interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this equation defines the irreversible spin - transfer occurring in the ferromagnetic layer , taken as an open system . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation rate is related to the spin - accumulation @xmath8 through an onsager transport coefficient @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( where @xmath8 is proportional to the current ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is linked to the relaxation times through the charge conservation laws ( or electric screening properties ) .    due to the large relaxation time separation </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution of the source term can be reduced to the effect of an environment that is responsible for an _ effective damping _ and _ effective fluctuations _ ( or effective temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transferred between ferromagnetic layer and the sub - system defined by the spin - accumulation conduction electrons can be positive or negative , depending on the sign of the spin accumulation at the different interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature is deduced in the activation ( stationary ) regime , because the relaxation time that couples the magnetization to the spin - polarized current short cuts the relaxation to the lattice . </S>"
