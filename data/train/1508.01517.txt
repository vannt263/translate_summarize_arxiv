    "the discoveries of mgb@xmath0@xcite and the iron - based superconductors@xcite have demonstrated that multiband superconductivity is a phenomenon with far reaching fundamental and applied implications .",
    "it provides a new route to high - temperature superconductivity , and for engineering superconducting materials with novel properties .",
    "research in this area has been very active , and , as a result , rich physics has been uncovered .",
    "one of the most exciting ideas that have been discussed is the possibility of time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) states in multiband systems @xcite .",
    "they appear as complex admixture of distinct and competing superconducting order parameters , like @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave .",
    "the three - band system with repulsive interband pairing is the prototypical model which exhibits intrinsic frustration : the presence of several superconducting states with the same symmetry , which are directly competing with each other . in this model",
    "there are three possible two - gap order parameters with sign change between the gaps of each possible pair ( @xmath3 states ) .",
    "they can not be easily reconciled with each other , and the complex trsb state appears as a natural compromise for a three - gap order parameter .",
    "this model is thought to be relevant for the iron - based superconductors , most of which are believed to be in some form of the @xmath3 state ( see recent reviews@xcite ) .",
    "the trsb state can potentially be tuned by doping in some of these materials @xcite .",
    "most of the research on trsb states was done in the clean limit , ignoring the effects of the ( unavoidable ) impurities and defects .",
    "however , it has been long recognized that even nonmagnetic impurities can be detrimental to multiband superconductivity @xcite , especially in the case of an order parameter with sign change ( for example , @xmath2-wave or @xmath3 state)@xcite .",
    "effects of disorder on the trsb states have not been studied so far , and it remains unclear if these states are reasonably robust , or , on the contrary , fragile and likely to be absent in any real material . in this paper",
    "i address this question , and consider the simplest possible three - band model with repulsive pairing interaction , which has well - established complex state in the clean limit .",
    "introducing disorder , i study its effects on the critical temperature line and the possible phases close to it .",
    "i demonstrate that @xmath4 is strongly suppressed by disorder .",
    "the complex state , however , is still possible , almost until superconductivity is completely destroyed . this surprising , at first sight , robustness of the trsb state is , in fact , easy to understand .",
    "as mentioned , this state is a complex admixture of three order parameter  the real two - gap @xmath3 states . even though suppressed , these real states survive moderate amount of disorder .",
    "as long as they are present , there is always a region on the phase diagram where they compete , and in it the complex state emerges as a compromise that minimizes the free energy .",
    "thus , the trsb state , arising in the tree - band model , could be observable in real materials ( in which some degree of disorder is aways present ) . in contrast , for cases in which one of the competing phases is more susceptible to destruction by disorder than the others ( say @xmath2-wave vs. @xmath1-wave ) , it seems likely that the trsb state region can be completely wiped out .",
    "it is interesting to note that disorder - induced interband scattering can continuously change the order parameter of a two - band superconductor from @xmath3 to @xmath5@xcite state .",
    "this transition can involve an intermediate complex combination of these two order parameters@xcite , and also leads to trsb state .",
    "it is effect entirely due to the presence of interband impurity scattering .",
    "thus , in some cases disorder is a necessary ingredient for the trsb states .",
    "furthermore , similar role to that of disorder can be played by a boundary scattering@xcite , or a proximity - coupled gap@xcite",
    "i consider a system described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are band indicies , running from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the bands are parabolic , with partial and total densities of states ( dos ) @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . for simplicity",
    "i assume they are identical , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the first term in eq . [ hamiltonian ] is the kinetic energy of the electrons , while the second term is due to impurities , which introduce both intraband and interband scattering .",
    "the scattering rates are parametrized by @xmath16 .",
    "the interband terms ( @xmath17 ) can be written as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the impurities concentration and potential respectively ( assuming @xmath22 is the same for each @xmath23 combination ) . since point defects , such as atomic substitutions or vacancies , can scatter carriers with large momentum change , the intraband and interband scattering rates are expected to be comparable @xcite .",
    "superconductivity is driven by the pairing potentials @xmath24 , which can scatter cooper pairs within the same band ( @xmath25 ) , or between different bands ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that the cooper pairs themselves are always composed of electrons from the same band .",
    "in general , there are six independent pairing interactions . for simplicity ,",
    "i ignore the inraband terms @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , i reduce the remaining three interband terms @xmath24 to two , by assuming that @xmath28 . finally , the interaction potentials are converted to dimensionless constants by using the dos : @xmath29 the last inequality is true for systems with only repulsive interband pairing interactions .",
    "all the coupling constants can be combined into a @xmath30 symmetric matrix @xmath31 i study the phase diagram of the model , assuming that @xmath32 is fixed , and varying @xmath33 from @xmath34 ( only two bands are coupled ) to @xmath35 ( a pair of bands is much weaker coupled ) .",
    "of special interest is the region around the degeneracy point @xmath36 .    in the superconducting state",
    "there are three gap parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , describing the superconducting condensate in each band .",
    "they can be written as @xmath40 ; the phases @xmath41 are gauge - dependent , but their differences @xmath42 are physically meaningful , gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "note that the superconducting state breaks only the overall @xmath43 symmetry .",
    "the system with @xmath44 given in eq . [ lambda ] has obvious frustration : each pair of gaps @xmath23 prefers to have @xmath45 , due to the repulsive @xmath46 pairing .",
    "however , since there are three such pairs , there is no way to satisfy this preference for all gaps simultaneously .",
    "thus , the different possible solutions compete , and this competition is the source of the trsb state .    in the clean limit",
    "the gap parameters obey three coupled nonlinear self - consistency equations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath49 is a high - energy cut - off ( e.g. , the debye frequency ) .",
    "when disorder is present , it leads to additional interband scattering and coupling of the gaps , and the self - consistency equations become considerably more complicated ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "however , close to the critical temperature these equations can be simplified by expanding them in powers of @xmath50 . in the presence of impurities",
    "this can be done systematically , starting from the usadel equations@xcite .",
    "the resulting gap equations can be though of as derived from an effective multigap ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy . in the clean case",
    "this free energy looks relatively simple @xcite . when interband impurity scattering is added , theory becomes more complicated ; for the two - gap case it was derived earlier @xcite . with three gaps",
    "the free energy can be written as @xmath51 where we have kept only terms up to quartic order in @xmath52 .",
    "the intraband terms @xmath53 look like three copies of standard single - gap gl theory , @xmath54 but with coefficients modified by disorder .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath55 there are many new terms appearing due to scattering from impurities .",
    "it can be written as : @xmath56 for processes that contribute to these terms see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1a]@xcite . in the clean limit ( @xmath57 )",
    "the standard gl function for multiband superconductor is recovered : @xmath58 . notice that @xmath55 is a simple extension of the two - band theory@xcite .",

    "is assumed , and no field , so i will ignore @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the microscopically derived mean - field equations are the main object of our theory , and the free energy given in eq .",
    "[ gl1 ] is secondary .",
    "although it may seem unnecessary to distinguish them , there are at least two problems in taking @xmath64 as a starting point .",
    "first , the region of validity of the multiband gl theory is a matter of ongoing debate@xcite . in addition , and even more seriously , when the interband pairing dominates , this simple gl theory becomes unstable .",
    "this is due to the presence of a passive superconducting channel , which has to be treated properly@xcite .",
    "the mean - field equations , however , remain valid .",
    "at @xmath4 only the linear terms in the self - consistency equations are important , and the problem can be reduced to a simple matrix one : @xmath65 where i have defined the column vector @xmath66 ( with transpose @xmath67 ) .",

    "there are two possible order parameters , as in the clean case , with the third eigenvector having unphysical transition temperature ( as already mentioned , the presence of this passive superconducting channel has important consequences@xcite ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , the form of @xmath66 at @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath77 _ at all _ , and we recover the clean limit order parameters exactly : @xmath78         -1        \\\\[0.3em ]        1               \\\\[0.3em ]       \\end{bmatrix},\\ \\ \\",

    "the other eigenvector has gaps on all three bands , with two of them having the same sign .",
    "these solutions represent different compromises for the underlying frustrated system .",
    "the critical temperatures do depend , of course , on @xmath77 , and are given by : @xmath79 so how do the impurities affect the critical temperature ?",
    "we plot the @xmath4 lines for both superconducting states as function of @xmath33 for several values of @xmath77 ( shown on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . as we can see , the two states critical temperatures cross at @xmath36 for any disorder strength . for @xmath33",
    "smaller than @xmath32 the two - gap solution is the leading instability ( since the system prefers to keep the weaker - coupled band normal ) .",
    "for @xmath80 the three - gap state condenses first ( and the weaker - coupled pair of bands has relative phase @xmath81 ) .",
    "so far , this is completely analogous to the clean case .",
    "the only effect of impurity scattering is to suppress @xmath4 of both states , and eventually a critical amount of disorder destroys the superconductivity in the system .",
    "this is as expected : because we are considering only repulsive interactions , superconductivity depends crucially on the sign change in the order parameter . since the interband scattering tends to average the gaps on the different bands , large enough @xmath77 averages the order parameter down to zero",
    ". plot of @xmath4 vs. @xmath77 is shown on fig .",
    "while for the two - gap state the @xmath4 suppression follows the universal abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) curve@xcite , the three - gap case appears more complicated , with clear deviation from the ag curve at very low critical temperatures and large @xmath82 ratios .",
    "however , when @xmath33 is close to @xmath32 the disorder suppression of the two critical temperatures is ( almost ) equal .    at the point",
    "@xmath36 the two - gap and the three gap solutions are degenerate , and any linear combination of them is a possible order parameter .",
    "in particular , a complex state can be constructed @xcite : @xmath83 .",
    "it was demonstrated in the clean limit that below @xmath4 this state plays an important role in the region of maximal frustration of the system @xmath84 .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this remains true in the presence of disorder .",
    "@xmath85{tcplot.png } \\includegraphics[width=0.43\\textwidth]{tcplot2.png } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "it was shown in the preceding section that there are two possible order parameters that can condense .",
    "which one is leading depends on the ratio @xmath82 .",
    "below @xmath4 the situation becomes considerably more complicated , and when @xmath84 the system may prefer a complex admixture of the two real states . to study this possibility",
    "we write a general complex order parameter @xmath86 ( it incorporates the @xmath87 symmetry of the problem ) .",
    "note that @xmath88 . by appropriate choice of gauge @xmath37",
    "is made real ( which is always possible ) .",
    "unlike the other two order parameters , however , @xmath89 is intrinsically complex ( for @xmath90 ) .",
    "this signifies the spontaneous breaking of the time - reversal symmetry of the system by the order parameter .",
    "it is caused by chiral pair currents in momentum space , when a pair is scattered from one band to another in a specific pattern ( for example @xmath91 ) .",
    "this symmetry breaking requires a second phase transition , below the customary superconducting one ( associated with the @xmath43 symmetry ) .",
    "it is important to understand the difference between the @xmath92 states in the two - band@xcite and the three - band systems@xcite . in the former the complex state",
    "is driven by interband impurity scattering , which leads to a quartic @xmath93 term in the gl expansion ( a term that vanishes in the clean limit)@xcite . in contrast , the three - band case has an intrinsic instability towards a trsb state , due to the competition between the three quadratic @xmath94 terms ( see , e.g. , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "this explains the different behavior of the two systems close to @xmath4 ( compare the phase diagrams constructed in refs . [ ] and [ ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic instability of the three - band model can be used to simplify the calculation .",
    "close to @xmath4 the most important terms in the self - consistency equations are linear ( i.e. , the terms with coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , we can concentrate on the effects of impurities on those terms , and neglect all impurity induced terms , which are small anyway .",
    "( this is equivalent to only keeping @xmath96 from @xmath55 , and completely ignoring @xmath60.@xcite )    with this , the first self - consistency equation is : @xmath97 the other two equations are more illuminating if written in terms of the gl coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath96 , where we have @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "( note that @xmath96 are negative , which seems to directly contradict the idea of phase frustration .",
    "it is , however , just a sign that the nave gl theory is unstable , and more care is needed in order to construct a proper gl free energy in the case interband pairing dominates@xcite . )",
    "the remaining mean - field equations are @xmath103 and @xmath104 alternatively , these equations can be obtained from @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "analyzing these equations provides a lot of useful information .",
    "first , note that they reduce correctly to the clean limit results @xcite for @xmath108 . from eq .",
    "[ eq_varphi ] we see that nonzero @xmath109 leads to @xmath110 .",
    "thus , if we start from two - gap state ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) the system can continuously transform _ only _ to the trsb state , but not directly to the three - gap one . also , note from eq .",

    ", @xmath114 is positive at high temperatures , and only changes sign and turns negative for finite temperature below @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the expression in the brackets can turn negative at some @xmath115 below the critical temperature , and the trsb state with @xmath90 and @xmath110 emerges .",

    "results are shown on figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . for @xmath117",
    "the two - gap state is the first to condense , and for @xmath80 the three - gap state is leading .",
    "the trsb state appears below @xmath4 in both cases , despite the presence of disorder in the system .",
    "note that the disorder is relatively weak , and the @xmath4 suppression is small  only about @xmath118 percent in both cases .",
    "however , calculations show the that the trsb state survives even in the case of much stronger disorder , when the critical temperature is only a small fraction of the clean limit @xmath4 , provided that both real order parameters still have non - zero @xmath4 .",
    "eventually , disorder completely suppresses the weaker superconducting channel , at which point trsb state also disappears .",
    "however , as long as the two channels are nearly degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , this single - order - parameter region is small , and trsb state survives as a part of the phase diagram .",

    "in this paper i considered the influence of disorder on a simple three - band model with repulsive interband pairing interactions .",
    "this model is known to support a complex trsb superconducting state in the region where the competition between the real two - gap and three - gap order parameters is strongest .",
    "as expected , the presence of impurities tends to suppress the critical temperature of all states , and for some finite value of disorder superconductivity is completely destroyed .",
    "however , the complex state remains possible in parts of the phase diagram even in the presence of moderate disorder , as long as there are two real superconducting channels .    the considered model and the derived results have to be taken with some caution .",
    "the three - band system is quite simple , and does not represent well the situation in iron - based superconductors ( which , at the very least , have more bands at the fermi level ) .",
    "this simplicity is the reason behind some artificial results , like the presence of ungapped band in the two - gap phase .",
    "this phase would likely disappear in a more realistic , and less symmetric cases , in agreement with the general argument in ref . .",
    "furthermore , the results are derived using expansion of the mean - field equations , valid only close to the critical temperature .",
    "in addition , i have neglected some quartic terms , with the assumption that they will not change the structure of the phase diagram ( at least close to @xmath4 ) . in spite of the simplifications ,",
    "these results are clear indication that trsb states , if present in the iron - based superconductors , can be relatively robust against disorder , and thus experimentally accessible .",
    "the discussion in this paper has been mostly concerned with the stability of the trsb state .",
    "once it is present , equally important and interesting questions are of the physical properties and the possible manifestations of this state .",
    "its presence requires a superconductor - to - superconductor transition , which may be detected in bulk thermodynamic property like the specific heat . once inside the complex state",
    ", its time - reversal nature can lead to induced currents and spontaneous magnetization close to impurities and edges @xcite ( in the bulk the breaking is a consequence of interband josephson currents , which do not lead to observable magnetization ) .",
    "collective modes of the trsb state are also quite interesting , as they consist of mixed phase - amplitude fluctuations of _ different _ gaps ( see , for example , refs . ) .",
    "another interesting consequence of the discreet symmetry breaking is the possibility of domain walls , whose presence can be used as a signature of this state @xcite .",
    "i acknowledge many useful discussions with alexei koshelev . this research was supported by doe - bes desc0001911 , and simons foundation .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath96 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for arbitrary @xmath77 and @xmath115 are provided in the supplemental material of ref . .",
    "closed forms for these coefficients in terms of the digamma function and its derivatives can also be obtained .          since i",
    "am mostly concerned with the case when two superconducting channels are nearly degenerate , the singe - order - parameter description@xcite shrinks to a very narrow region close to @xmath4 , and one has to use the full three - gap equations .",
    "numerical calculations show that , in the physically relevant regime , the quartic , intrinsically two - band , contributions ( e.g. @xmath121 ) are at least an order of magnitude smaller then the single band ones ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this justifies dropping them in the usual gl region of validity ( close to @xmath4 ) . in it",
    "these terms are sub - leading , in the sense that the only result of their presence would be to move the boundaries of the different phases slightly , and would not change the overall topology of the phase diagram ."
