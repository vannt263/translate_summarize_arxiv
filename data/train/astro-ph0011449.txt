    "lithium - beryllium - boron take a special status in the general framework of nucleosynthesis .",
    "these nuclei , are indeed of exceptional fragility and they are destroyed in stars above about 1 million degrees .",
    "the main formation process available is spallation , i.e. fragmentation of medium light isotopes ( cno ) leading to lighter species as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the physical parameters of the spallation mechanism are fourfold : i ) the production cross sections as a function of energy are fairly well measured in the laboratory ii ) the source composition of the energetic component ii ) the associated ( injection ) energy spectrum iv ) the target composition . in the following , we describe the two reverse spallative processes able to produce libeb and we confront them to observational constraints .",
    "we show how the relation between oxygen and iron , in the halo phase is determining to discriminate between the two processes .",
    "the pioneering article of meneguzzi , audouze and reeves ( 1971 ) offered the first quantitative explanation of the local abundances of libeb , at a time when only cumulated abundances in the solar system were available .",
    "the standard galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) , essentially composed of fast protons and alphas collide with cno nuclei sitting in the interstellar medium to yield measured libeb abundances . but the observed isotopic ratios of li and b were not reproduced .",
    "a stellar source of @xmath5 was made necessary . for @xmath4",
    "a complementary had hoc spallative source of low energy was invoqued .    introducing the time parameter , i.e. taking into account the fact that the amount of cno varies in the ism as well as the flux of cosmic rays ( protons and alphas ) , presumably like the rate of supernovae , itself responsible for the increment of metallicity , leads to the following evolution : the abundance of a given light element increases like the square of the cno abundance ( or as a good approximation to o ) . thus according to the classical tradition in galactic evolution , the production of libeb by the gcr",
    "is called `` secondary '' .    in the nineties , measurements of",
    "be / h and b / h from keck and hst , together with [ fe / h ] in low metallicity halo stars came to set strong constraints on the origin and evolution of libeb isotopes .",
    "the evolution of beb was suddenly uncovered over about 10 gyr , taking [ fe / h ] as an evolutionary index .",
    "the linearity between be , b and iron came as a surprise since a quadratic relation was expected from the standard gcr mechanism .",
    "it was a strong indication that the standard gcrs are not the main producers of libeb in the early galaxy .",
    "a new mechanism of primary nature ( production rate independent of the interstellar metallicity , i.e. beb abundances prop to o ) was required to reproduce these observations : it has been proposed that low energy co nuclei ( a few tens mev / n ) produced and accelerated by massive stars ( wr and sn ii in superbubbles , i.e. cavities in the interstellar medium excavated by the winds and explosion of massive stars ) fragment on h and he at rest in the ism .",
    "this low energy component ( lec ) has the advantage of coproducing be and b in good agreement with the ratio observed in pop ii stars ( vangioni - flam et al 2000 and ramaty et al 2000 ) .",
    "the term `` metallicity '' , up to now has been ambiguously defined .",
    "in fact , all the above argumentation assumes that cno / fe is constant at [ fe / h ] less than -1 .",
    "since oxygen is the main progenitor of beb , the apparent linear relation between beb and fe could be misleading if o was not strictly proportional to fe .",
    "thus the pure primary origin of beb in the early galaxy could be questionned .",
    "if o / fe is constant , the gcr process is unsignificant due to the paucity of the ism in cno in the halo phase .",
    "the lec process is obviously predominent , since it is free from the ism metallicity , relying on freshly synthesized he , c , and o. progressively , following the general enrichment of the ism , gcr gain importance .",
    "neutrino spallation plays its marginal role , increasing the abundance of @xmath4 .",
    "recent observations of israelian et al ( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al ( 1999 ) ( ib ) showing a neat slope in the o - fe plot have seeded a trouble .",
    "if they are verified , the whole interpretation has to be modified , giving a larger role to the secondary process in the halo phase ( fields and olive 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the primary component is also required in the very early galaxy .",
    "however these observations are considered as controversial , and the whole session is centered on this point .",
    "what is the right o - fe correlation ?",
    "this point is crucial to translate the be , b - fe relations into b , be - o ones . in the ib observations , [ o / fe]= -0.35 [ fe / h ] , and consequently log ( be / h ) is proportional to 1.55 [ o / h ] .",
    "fields and olive ( 1999 ) use this relation to rehabilitate the classical standard gcr as the progenitor of libeb .",
    "but , beyond the observational questioning , this scenario meets with theoretical difficulties .",
    "the energy cost to produce a single be nucleus is unfavorable but not prohibitive since this cost is plagued by large uncertainties ( fields et al 2000 ) .",
    "the main difficulty is that the stellar supernova yields integrated in a galactic evolutionary model can not fit the new o / fe data ( f. matteucci this meeting ) .",
    "moreover , the observational [ @xmath6,/fe ] vs [ fe / h ] where @xmath6 = mg , si , ca , ti show a plateau from [ fe / h ] = -4 to -1 . it would be surprising that oxygen does not follow the mg , si and ca trends since all these nuclei are produced by the same massive stars . if the trend expressed in this meeting , namely that [ o / fe ]",
    "is approximatively constant or slightly varying in the halo phase is confirmed , then the theoretical situation is clarified and the primary component made necessary in the early galaxy , until at least [ fe / h]= -1 .",
    "the synthesis of libeb in the halo proceeds through nuclear spallation , essentially by the break up of oxygen and the @xmath7 reaction .",
    "the observed relation between beb and fe has to be translated through the o - fe relation into a beb - o which is representative of the relevant physical production process .",
    "and then the observational o - fe relation is determining .",
    "( except if be , b and o are measured simultaneoulsy in stars ( a.m. boesgaard and k. cunha , this meeting ) .",
    "anyway the primary component is required in the halo phase , then afterwards the secondary process takes over ; the question is therefore at which metallicity the transition occurs , the answer depends of the behaviour of [ o / fe ] .",
    "the ideal test of the scenarios would be to get the evaluation of o , fe , mg be , b , li abundances in the same stars .",
    "impressive progress are waited from the vlt .",
    "gamma ray line astronomy , through the european integral satellite , to be lauched in 2002 , will help to constrain the energy spectrum and intensity of lec ."
