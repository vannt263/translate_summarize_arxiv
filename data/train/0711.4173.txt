    "( 2006b ) presented detailed spectral and morphological information of some new sources discovered in the _ hess _ survey along with some discussions on possible counterparts in other wavelength bands .",
    "some sources discovered in the survey can be associated with old snrs .",
    "for example , hess j1804@xmath1216 has a flux of nearly 25% of the flux of the crab nebula with a photon index of about 2.72 .",
    "the source can be associated with either the shell - type snr g8.7@xmath12.1 or the young vela - like pulsar psr j1803@xmath12137 ( aharonian et al .",
    "furthermore , fatuzzo , melia , & crocker ( 2006 ) found that the snr g8.7@xmath12.1 can plausibly account for all known radiative characteristics of hess j1804@xmath1216 .",
    "another case is hess  j1834@xmath1087 , which is an extended tev source discovered in the _ hess _ survey of the inner galaxy in vhe @xmath2-ray band .",
    "the source , spatially coincident with the snr g23.3@xmath10.3 , has a @xmath2-ray flux of 8% of the flux of the crab nebula above 200 gev , and the @xmath2-ray spectrum can be expressed by a power law with a photon index of @xmath3 ( aharonian et al .",
    "the new _ xmm - newton _  observation reveals diffuse x - ray emission within the _ hess _ source and suggests an association between the diffuse x - rays and the vhe @xmath2-rays , moreover , g23.3@xmath10.3 is estimated to be an old snr with a distance of @xmath4 kpc and an age of @xmath5 yr ( tian et al .",

    "theoretically , it is believed that the non - thermal photon spectrum for a given snr is produced through electron / positron synchrotron radiation , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering as well as @xmath6 decay from the p - p interactions .",

    "for the young snrs , the secondary particles produced via the p - p interaction have a negligible contribution to the non - thermal photon spectrum ( e.g. zhang & fang 2007 ) .",
    "on the other hand , yamazaki et al . ( 2006 ) studied the emission from old snrs and found that proton acceleration could be efficient enough to emit tev @xmath2-rays both at the shock of the snr and at the giant molecular cloud .",
    "they presented that the energy flux ratio @xmath7 can be more than @xmath8 for some snrs , and such sources may be the origins of the recently discovered unidentified tev sources . for the old snrs ,",
    "the energies of the primary electrons accelerated by the shock wave are limited by the synchrotron cooling , then the roll - off energy of the synchrotron emission of the primary electrons is much smaller than that for the young snrs ( sturner et al . 1997 ; yamazaki et al . 2006 ; zhang & fang 2007 ) .",
    "however , the secondary @xmath0 pairs can be produced from the p - p collisions in an snr for a long time due to the large energy loss time for the p - p interaction .",
    "therefore , the contributions of secondary electrons and positrons to the non - thermal emission can become prominent for the old snrs .",
    "motivated by above discussions , we study the non - thermal photon spectra from old snrs based on the time - dependent model in which the contribution of the secondary @xmath0 pairs is included ( see  2.2 ) .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the temporally evolving model of the non - thermal particle and photon spectra are discussed in section [ sec : model ] , including the snr evolution , shock acceleration , and various photon production mechanisms involved in the model .",

    "we now apply the model in this paper to the old snr g23.3@xmath10.3 , which has been observed in radio , x - ray and vhe @xmath2-ray bands .",
    "firstly , using the similar process as that for the snr g8.7@xmath10.1 , we find @xmath50 must be about 0.2 for the snr g23.3@xmath10.3 with parameters , a distance of 4 kpc , @xmath155 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and an age of several @xmath166 yr . fig .",

    "the primary electrons accelerated directly by the shock wave usually dominate the secondary @xmath0 pairs produced from the p - p collisions for a young snr , however , the emission from the secondary @xmath0 pairs becomes more and more important and eventually surpasses the radiation from the primary electrons as the snr grows old because the source of the primary electrons is cut off and the synchrotron radiation loss is significant for electrons when the snr is in the radiative phase , whereas the secondary @xmath0 pairs can be produced for a long time due to the small cross section for the p - p interaction ( see fig .",

    "@xmath50 , which can not be directly deduced from the observations now and is usually limited by comparison of the model results with the multi - band observations for a given snr , is also a crucial parameter to determine whether the contribution to the final non - thermal emission of the secondary @xmath0 pairs dominates that of the primary electrons . for an old snr with small @xmath50 , the non - thermal photons with energies @xmath172",
    "are usually produced mainly via the radiations of the secondary @xmath0 pairs ( see fig . [",

    "the model is applied to two old shell - type snrs , g8.7@xmath10.1 and g23.3@xmath10.3 , whose vhe @xmath2-rays are detected in the _ hess _ survey of the inner galaxy .",
    "g8.7@xmath10.1 is a shell - type snr with an age of @xmath173 yr .",

    "it can be concluded that ( 1 ) the radio emission from the snr is mainly from the synchrotron radiation of the primary electrons , whereas the non - thermal photons with energies around 0.1 kev primarily come from the synchrotron radiation of the secondary @xmath0 pairs produced from the p - p collisions ; ( 2 ) the observed x - ray photons with energies ranging from 2 to 10 kev are produced mainly via the bremsstrahlung of the primary electrons ; ( 3 ) the tev photons with energies @xmath160 tev are primarily from both the bremsstrahlung of the primary electrons and the p - p collisions of the primary protons , however , those with higher energies are produced mainly through the p - p interaction ( see fig .",

    "we find that , using @xmath164 and an age of @xmath5 yr with other appropriate parameters , the model result agrees with the radio and vhe @xmath2-ray observations , but the calculated x - ray flux is significantly lower than the observed one given by _",

    "the modeling results can be consistent with both the radio , vhe @xmath2-ray observations and the x - ray flux with these parameters .",
    "moreover , the emission from the secondary @xmath0 pairs is negligible and the multi - wavelength photons with those parameters for the snr mainly come from the radiation of the primary particles , and the tev photons primarily have hadronic origin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:087 ] ) .",
    "the model in this paper includes the contribution of the secondary @xmath0 pairs produced from the p - p collisions to the non - thermal emission from snrs .",
    "the secondary @xmath0 pairs can be produced for a long time and experience energy losses and diffusion , and the contribution of the secondary @xmath0 pairs to the final non - thermal emission from an snr can become more and more important and eventually surpasses that of the primary electrons when the snr ages in the radiative phase . whether the contribution of the secondary @xmath0 pairs to the final non - thermal emission is prominent or not depends heavily on the snr age , @xmath50 and @xmath16 .",
    "these parameters can be limited by the comparison of the model result with the multi - wavelength observations for a given snr , however , the shortage of precise observations and uncertainties such as the initial eject mass and the initial velocity of the shock lessen the reliability of the calculated results",
    ". on the other hand , for an old snr with observed tev emission , if the tev photons primarily have hadronic origin , the emission from the secondary @xmath0 pairs is usually prominent .",
    "the morphology of the resulting spectrum for an snr in the energy range between 10 mev to 1 tev directly relates to the primary origin of the vhe photons .",
    "fortunately , the gamma ray large area space telescope ( _ glast _ ) have a good sensitivity and resolution in the energy range between 30 mev and 300 gev , and the observations with _ glast _ will give a direct evidence on whether the tev photons from an snr mainly have hadronic origin or leptonic origin .",
    "obviously , _ glast _ will give more limits on the parameters in the modeling process with the model in this paper for an snr , and then we can get more insights on the acceleration and photon production processes involved in snrs .",
