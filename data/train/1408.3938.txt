    "as one of the low - lying scalars , the state @xmath10 has turned out to be mysterious in the quark model scenario .",

    "the measurement of @xmath2 is an additional observable constraining any phenomenological models trying to understand the nature of the @xmath10 .",
    "a chiral unitary coupled channels approach of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite is applied in investigation of the four - body decays @xmath12 process  @xcite where the @xmath13 stands for a baryon and the @xmath14 for a meson . in this approach , the process @xmath15 is investigated with the @xmath10 meson generated through final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "the amplitude of this process is calculable except for some coefficients which are not restricted , and its branching fraction varies within a wide range for different coefficients .",
    "therefore , an experimental measurement of the process @xmath6 is needed for further progress in understanding of the dynamics of the four - body decay processes taking the fsi of mesons into account .    in this paper , we present a measurement of @xmath2 with @xmath10 decaying to @xmath16 based on @xmath0 @xmath1 events  @xcite collected with the besiii detector at bepcii .",

    "bepcii is a double - ring @xmath17 collider running at 2.0 - 4.6 gev center - of - mass energies ; it provides a peak luminosity of 0.4@xmath1810@xmath19  @xmath20s@xmath21 at the center - of - mass energy of 3.097  gev .",
    "the cylindrical besiii detector has an effective geometrical acceptance of @xmath22 of 4@xmath23 .",
    "it contains a small cell helium - based ( 40@xmath24 he , 60@xmath24 c@xmath25h@xmath26 ) main drift chamber ( mdc ) which has 43 cylindrical layers and provides an average single - hit resolution of 135  @xmath27 m and momentum measurements of charged particles ; a time - of - flight system ( tof ) consisting of 5  cm thick plastic scintillators , with 176 detectors of length 2.4  m in two layers in the barrel and 96 fan - shaped detectors in the end caps ; an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) consisting of 6240 csi(tl ) crystals in a cylindrical structure and two end caps , which is used to measure the energies of photons and electrons ; and a muon system ( muc ) consisting of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) . the momentum resolution of the charged particle is 0.5@xmath24 at 1  gev/@xmath28 in a 1 tesla magnetic field .",

    "the subsequent decays are generated with evtgen  @xcite with branching fractions being set to the world average values according to the particle data group  ( pdg ) @xcite and the remaining unmeasured decays are generated by lundcharm  @xcite .",
    "a sample of @xmath36 simulated events , corresponding to the luminosity of data , is used to study background processes from @xmath1 decays ( ` inclusive backgrounds ' ) . a signal mc sample with more than 10 times of the observed events in data for the process @xmath37",

    "since the charged track in this process has relatively low transverse momentum , charged particle identification  ( pid ) is only based on the @xmath29 information with the confidence level prob@xmath41(i ) calculated for each particle hypothesis @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a charged track with prob@xmath41(p)@xmath44prob@xmath45 and prob@xmath41(p)@xmath44prob@xmath46 is identified as a proton or an antiproton candidate .",

    "the measurements are performed by requiring different numbers of photon candidates in one event and selecting the combination of @xmath78 with invariant mass closest to the mass of @xmath79 or @xmath80 , or selecting the combination of @xmath84 closest to the mass of @xmath82 .",

    "conservatively , the systematic uncertainty of @xmath67 veto metric is estimated to be @xmath109 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to the signal shape is determined by varying the coupling constants by 1@xmath71 within their center values for @xmath110 and @xmath111 separately .",
    "the largest difference is taken as the uncertainty .    to study the uncertainty from background ,",
    "alternative background shapes are obtained by varying the fitting range from [ 0.7 , 1.12 ] gev / c@xmath112 to [ 0.73 , 1.12 ] gev / c@xmath112 and changing order of chebychev polynomial from third - order to fourth - order , which introduce uncertainties of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the total number of @xmath1 events is obtained by studying inclusive hadronic @xmath1 decays  @xcite to be @xmath115 .",

    "one of them , namely @xmath118 in @xcite , is constrained by fitting the @xmath119 invariant mass distribution in the decay @xmath90 ; the fit suggests two equally possible values , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the theory also predicts that the branching fractions of @xmath2 and @xmath90 are comparable for @xmath121 , while the branching fraction of the former is one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of the latter for @xmath120 .",
