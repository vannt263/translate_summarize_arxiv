    "since the discovery of cosmic acceleration from measurements of luminosity distances of type ia supernovae ( sn ) in 1998  @xcite and its confirmation by several other independent cosmological data , the nature of the component driving this acceleration , the so - called dark energy ( de hereafter ) , has been deeply debated . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "the @xmath3 cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm ) , the acceleration is produced by the cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "this model is consistent with the majority of the observational data , but the known theoretical problems of the cosmological constant led cosmologists to formulate several other alternative models able , from one side , to relieve the aforementioned theoretical issues and , on the other side , to explain observations .",
    "alternative models for the de , such as quintessence , are called ( models of ) dynamical dark energy and , even if not favoured , they are currently not excluded by observations @xcite .",
    "several of these alternative models are characterized by the existence of an additional scalar field which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "if this is the case , it is expected that this additional component is coupled to the rest of the theory s fields .    in this paper",
    "we study the coupling of dynamical de models with the electromagnetic field : indeed , the presence of this coupling would lead to a space - time variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , would generate distinctive signatures in cosmological data , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but also in low and medium redshift probes , for example in the peak of luminosity in sn or in the metal absorption lines of distant quasars ( qso ) .",
    "the present work aims to extend and to complete the analysis done in @xcite , where constraints on the coupling of a time - varying fine structure constant in the presence of early dark energy were obtained with cmb data . in this paper",
    "we focus on low - medium redshift observables , forecasting sn and qso data , weak lensing shear power spectrum measurements ( wl ) , and redshift - drift ( rd ) data .",
    "the relevance of this combination of probes is the coverage of a wide redshift range ( @xmath4 ) which is a very powerful way to discriminate between a cosmological constant and a dynamical de model , as it makes possible to investigate the onset of de . in other words ,",
    "given the possibility of a dynamical field that is moving very slowly ( in appropriate units ) , searching for deviations from a cosmological constant is optimally done by maximizing the lever arm of probed redshifts .    in the present work",
    "we assume only a time - varying fine structure constant , neglecting spatial variation .",
    "recent analyses of cmb data @xcite have shown no evidence of a spatial variation ; there is instead some evidence of a spatial variation from lower redshift qso measurements @xcite , and attempts are being made to independently confirm it @xcite . for the moment",
    "we note that our method could in principle be extended to the more complex models needed to account for such spatial variations .",
    "we consider two different classes of time - varying @xmath0 models . in the first class",
    "the scalar field causing the @xmath0 variation is also responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe , and therefore observational tests of the evolution of @xmath0 directly contribute to constrain dark energy scenarios @xcite . in the second class",
    "the additional degree of freedom which causes the @xmath0 variation is not ( or at most is only partially ) the source of the de component .",
    "this second class is important for two reasons .",
    "firstly , although consistency tests are available , erroneous dark energy properties could be inferred if the @xmath0 evolution is ascribed to de instead of this `` external '' degree of freedom ; this scenario has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , there may be a bias induced on the cosmological parameters estimation due to a wrong assumption on the underlying cosmological model , i.e. selecting a dataset with a non - zero variation of @xmath0 , but assuming no variation in the analysis .",
    "we investigate this possibility here .",
    "should such a bias be non - negligible and found in future data , it could hint for the need of an extended underlying theoretical model in the analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ii ] we introduce the dynamical de models considered in this work and derive the time evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] contains the description of the different probes we exploit and we highlight the main features of each observable . section  [ sec : iv ] details the analysis we perform and the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] .",
    "we then discuss our results in the concluding sec .",
    "[ sec : vi ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the two broad classes of models for the evolution of the fine structure constant and present specific examples for each class , then used in the rest of the paper . in the first class ,",
    "the dynamical degree of freedom providing the @xmath0 variation is also responsible for the observationally required dark energy , while in the second class the degree of freedom is not , or only partially , responsible for the dark energy component .",
    "the observational probes are affected in different ways by these scenarios , thus leading , in principle , to constraints on de parameters and on the coupling with electromagnetism which are specific to the particular model .      in this first case",
    "we assume that there is a single additional degree of freedom ( typically , a scalar field ) responsible for the cosmic acceleration , and coupled to the electromagnetic sector , thus leading to the time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "we consider two different models for the de component : a phenomenological generic parametrization of the de equation of state parameter , the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization , and a more physically motivated early dark energy ( ede ) model .",
    "* in the cpl model @xcite the de equation of state ( eos ) is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the present value of @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the coefficient of the time - dependent term of the eos .",
    "+ in this model the eos has a trend with redshift that is not intended to mimic a particular model for dark energy , but rather to allow to probe possible deviations from the @xmath3cdm standard paradigm without the assumption of any underlying theory .",
    "nevertheless , we can assume that also this kind of de is produced by a scalar field .",
    "* in the ede model @xcite , the dark energy density fraction @xmath10 ( i.e. , the fraction of energy density of the de component over the total energy density ) and equation of state @xmath11 are parametrized in the following way @xmath12 } \\frac{d\\ln\\omega_{\\rm ede}}{d\\ln a } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{a_{eq}}{3(a + a_{eq } ) }   \\label{eq : edew } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the scale factor at matter - radiation equality and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the current dark energy and matter density , respectively .",
    "a flat universe is assumed and the present value for the equation of state is obtained demanding @xmath16 .",
    "the energy density @xmath17 has a scaling behaviour evolving with time and going to a finite constant @xmath18 in the past .",
    "+ in this case the eos follows the behaviour of the dominant component at each cosmic time ; @xmath19 during radiation domination , @xmath20 during matter domination , and @xmath21 in recent times , as in a cosmological constant era .",
    "we add dark energy perturbations as in @xcite but we fix the clustering parameters to the values expected in the case of a scalar field .    in these models the dynamical scalar fields are expected to be naturally coupled to the rest of the theory , unless a ( still unknown ) symmetry suppresses this coupling @xcite .",
    "we assume that this is the case for our toy models too , and , following the line of @xcite , we want to study the coupling of the dark energy degree of freedom with the electromagnetic field .    the coupling between the scalar field , @xmath22 , and electromagnetism stems from a gauge kinetic function @xmath23 @xmath24 which , to a good approximation , can be assumed linear @xcite , @xmath25    this form of the gauge kinetic function can be seen as the first term of a taylor expansion , which is indeed a good approximation for a slowly varying field at low redshifts , as the low - redshift constraints on couplings , obtained both directly from astrophysical measurements and through local tests of equivalence principle violations , are quite tight . for the latter category we can refer to the conservative constraint @xcite @xmath26 in @xcite , the authors obtained an independent few - percent constraint on this coupling using cmb and large - scale structure data in combination with direct measurements of the expansion rate of the universe .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 is given by @xmath27 and , since the evolution of the putative scalar field can be expressed in terms of the dark energy properties @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xcite @xmath30 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the logarithm of the scale factor , we finally obtain the following explicit relation for the evolution of the fine structure constant in this dynamical dark energy class of models @xmath31}\\frac{dz'}{1+z'}\\,.\\ ] ]    as expected , in this class of models the magnitude of the @xmath0 variation is controlled by the strength of the coupling @xmath2 .",
    "we also note that these two equations can be phenomenologically generalized to the case of phantom equations of state , by simply switching the sign of the @xmath32 term @xcite .    here",
    "@xmath33 is the fraction of energy density provided by the scalar field , thus it corresponds to eq.([eq : edeom ] ) in the ede case , while for the cpl parametrization it s easily found to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the present time energy densities of matter and de .      in this scenario",
    "the degree of freedom responsible for the @xmath0 variation does not provide the dark energy , or at least is constrained to provide only a fraction of it by current observations .",
    "one effectively has a @xmath3cdm model with an additional ( often phenomenological ) degree of freedom accounting for the @xmath0 variation .    in this case",
    "the direct link between varying couplings and dark energy discussed above is also lost . nevertheless , it is possible to observationally infer that a given @xmath0 variation is _ not _ due to a type i model , as such an assumption could lead to consequences that can be observationally ruled out . this possibility has already been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we will discuss this class in a slightly different context .",
    "the simplest toy model of this kind is the bekenstein - sandvik - barrow - magueijo ( bsbm ) model @xcite .",
    "these theories require some fine - tuning , even to fit purely temporal @xmath0 variations as that of @xcite , but for our purposes they are useful for parametrizing the biases introduced in cosmological parameter estimations if there is an @xmath0 variation which is neglected in the analysis .",
    "for the @xmath0 variation itself we can , to a good approximation , assume a simple one - parameter ( @xmath37 ) evolution , like @xmath38    an alternative example of this class is provided by the string - theory inspired runaway dilaton scenario @xcite , where the @xmath0 evolution is also relatively simple .",
    "in this section we characterize the different observables we will use in our analysis .",
    "type ia supernovae are a particular class of supernovae , providing bright , standardizable candles , and constraining cosmic acceleration through the hubble diagram . at present",
    ", they are the most effective and mature probe of dark energy .    moreover ,",
    "as the sn peak luminosity ( @xmath39 ) depends on photon diffusion time , which in turn depends on @xmath0 through the opacity , the @xmath0 variation could affect @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the key mechanism is the energy deposition rate in the decay chain @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to @xmath41 which corresponds to @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 the absolute magnitude at peak , and the subscript ",
    "@xmath45 \" indicates we are not accounting for the @xmath0 variation .    decreasing alpha decreases the opacity , allowing photons to escape faster , thus increasing @xmath39 .",
    "this can be trivially translated to a change in the distance modulus @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the apparent magnitude as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is function of the luminosity distance @xmath50 the @xmath51 expression encodes the chosen dark energy model .",
    "we build the sn datasets following the procedure presented in @xcite .",
    "we use euclid specifications @xcite to forecast a sn survey at low - intermediate @xmath52 , containing @xmath53 supernovae uniformly distributed in the redshift range @xmath54 .",
    "the frequencies of narrow metal absorption lines in quasar absorption systems are sensitive to @xmath0 @xcite , and the different transitions have different sensitivities .",
    "observationally , one expects relative velocity shifts between transitions in a given absorber , in a single spectrum , if @xmath0 does vary ; this comparison can therefore be used to obtain measurements of @xmath0 in these absorption systems .",
    "indeed a survey able to observe quasar absorption lines at different redshifts is able to reconstruct the variation of @xmath0 with respect to the present value and to provide a dataset corresponding to the left side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dalfa ] ) .    currently , there is controversial evidence @xcite for a space - time variation of @xmath0 at the level of a few parts per million , roughly in the redhsift range @xmath55 .",
    "part of the uncertainty in these results stems from the fact that the large samples of spectra being used have been gathered for other purposes and are therefore inhomogeneous , and may be vulnerable to systematic errors which are difficult to quantify .",
    "an ongoing dedicated vlt - uves large program is trying to clarify this issue @xcite , but the ultimate solution is to use high - resolution ultra - stable spectrographs , for which these measurements are a key science driver .    for representative future datasets we use the baseline ( conservative ) case discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) equipped with a high - resolution , ultra - stable spectrograph ( elt - hires ) , for which the cosmic dynamics experiment ( codex ) phase a study @xcite provides a baseline reference .",
    "we assume uniformly distributed measurements in the redshift range @xmath56 , with an error @xmath57 .",
    "qso observations can be also used to constrain de models through the so called redshift - drift of these sources @xcite .",
    "the redshift - drift is the change of the redshift due to the expansion of the universe between two observations of the same distant source spectrum , repeated after a given amount of ( terrestrial ) years .",
    "the required time lapse depends on the instrument used ( and specifically on its calibration stability ) but is typically of the order of a decade with next - generation facilities .    with this kind of observations one can exploit distant astrophysical sources as a probe of the expansion of the universe in a model independent way @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite qso are the ideal astrophysical objects to observe the redshift variation @xmath58 between two observations .",
    "this @xmath58 can be translated to a spectroscopic velocity @xmath59 and connected to cosmological quantities through the relation @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the speed of light and @xmath62 is the time interval between two observations of the same astrophysical source .",
    "a codex - like spectrograph will have the ability to detect the cosmological redshift - drift in the lyman @xmath0 absorption lines of distant ( 2 @xmath63 5 ) qsos , even though this is a very small signal .",
    "the e - elt can decisively detect the redshift variation with a 4000 hours of integration in a period of @xmath64 years @xcite .",
    "these may be complemented by measurements at other redshifts using ska @xcite .    according to monte carlo simulations of the codex phase a study @xcite , the error on the measured spectroscopic velocity shift @xmath65 that can be expressed as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the signal to noise ratio , @xmath68 the number of observed quasars , @xmath69 their redshift and the exponent @xmath70 is equal to @xmath71 when @xmath72 , while it becomes @xmath73 beyond that redshift .",
    "therefore , we can forecast a redshift - drift dataset where the error bars are computed using eq.([eq : error ] ) , with @xmath74 and a number of qso @xmath75 is assumed to be uniformly distributed among the following redshift bins @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies is a powerful observable to probe the geometry of the universe and to map the dark matter distribution .",
    "we describe the distortion of the images of distant galaxies through the tensor  @xcite +    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the convergence field and @xmath79 is the complex shear field .",
    "we can rewrite these quantities as a function of the projected newtonian potentials @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 where the commas indicate the derivatives with respect to the directions transverse to the line of sight and the projected potentials are given by @xmath83 , i.e. integrating the gravitational potentials with the lensing kernel @xmath84 with @xmath85 the galaxy redshift distribution and @xmath86 the comoving distance @xmath87    we can define the convergence power spectra in a given redshift bin in the following way @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the non - linear matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath52 , obtained correcting the linear one @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 is a weighting function @xmath92 with subscripts @xmath93 and @xmath94 indicating the redshift bin .",
    "the observed power spectra are affected mainly by systematic uncertainties arising from the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies @xmath95 .",
    "these uncertainties can be reduced averaging over a large number of sources .",
    "the observed convergence power spectra will be hence @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of sources per steradian in the @xmath98 bin .",
    "in this paper we simulate a weak lensing dataset according to the specifications expected for the euclid survey @xcite : the mission will observe @xmath99 over an area @xmath100 , corresponding to a sky fraction @xmath101 . the large galaxy number density and the wide area observed will allow euclid to provide us with a tomographic reconstruction of the weak lensing signal .",
    "we therefore divide the redshift space in 10 bins , chosen in such a way to have the same fraction of the total observed galaxies in each one ( see table [ tab : bins ] ) . using these specifications",
    "we build the @xmath102-by-@xmath102 convergence power spectrum and the @xmath103 uncertainties , computed as @xcite @xmath104    .euclid redshift bins considered in this analysis .",
    "the redshift range of every bin is chosen in such a way that each bin contains 10% of the galaxies observed by the survey . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : rescplede ]",
    "while in section  [ sec : v ] we focused only on the key results of our analyses , in this appendix we list in section  [ sec : van_all ] the constraints on all the parameters as determined from different combinations of probes , and in section  [ sec : nonvan ] we report the 1-dimensional posteriors and the constraints for the sampled parameters when a non - standard fiducial model is assumed .",
    "for vanishing @xmath105 datasets we performed several analyses , excluding each time one of the observables presented in section  [ sec : iii ] . in this way we could explore and highlight the contribution of each observable to the constraints . in table  [ tab : rescplede ] we report the 68% confidence level errors on relevant cosmological parameters and in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescplede ] we show the 1-dimensional posteriors recovered for both cpl and ede models .",
    "we can notice how removing qso and atomic clocks from the analysis we lose , trivially , all the constraining power for the coupling @xmath2 , while as expected removing wl and/or sn opens the de parameters .",
    "in this section we report the constraints obtained when a non standard @xmath3cdm cosmology and a non vanishing @xmath105 is assumed ( set2 , set3 , set4 in table  [ tab : fid_nost ] ) .",
