    "the foremost candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) composing galactic haloes is the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle , namely the neutralino @xcite .",
    "if so , then neutralino pair annihilation may lead to observable consequences , in particular the emission of high energy @xmath0-radiation @xcite .",
    "the possibility that such @xmath0-rays may be identified by forthcoming atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( act ) such as veritas @xcite or by satellite - borne detectors like glast @xcite has excited considerable recent interest @xcite .",
    "it is clearly of importance to identify the best places to search for such an annihilation signal .",
    "inspired by the highly cusped models based on numerical simulations of dark halo formation @xcite , a number of investigators have suggested that the centre of the milky way may be the optimum target .",
    "for example , bergstrom _",
    "_ @xcite have shown that if the dark matter density is cusped as @xmath1 at small radii , then the @xmath0-ray flux would be detectable for typical neutralino properties in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "inspired also by the persistence of substructure in numerical simulations , a number of authors @xcite have argued that a substantial enhancement in the @xmath0-ray signal can be expected from such ` clumps ' . in these calculations ,",
    "the inner regions of the substructure are also usually assumed to be cusped .",
    "however , even within the framework of the cusped models favored by cosmological simulations , these conclusions have been contested as being overly optimistic @xcite .",
    "more awkwardly , there is a substantial body of astrophysical evidence that the halo of the milky way is not cusped at all @xcite .",
    "first , the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic center is very high .",
    "particle dark matter does not cause microlensing , whereas faint stars and brown dwarfs do .",
    "the total amount of all matter within the solar circle is constrained by the rotation curve , so this tells us that lines of sight towards the galactic center are not dominated by particle dark matter .",
    "more specifically , haloes as strongly cusped as @xmath1 , normalised to the local dark matter density as inferred from the stellar kinematics in the solar neighbourhood , are ruled out by the high microlensing optical depth @xcite .",
    "second , the pattern speed of the galactic bar is known to be fast from hydrodynamical modelling of the motions of neutral and ionised gas . if dark matter dominates the central regions of the milky way , then dynamical friction will strongly couple the dark matter to the galactic bar and cause it to decelerate on a few bar rotation timescales @xcite .",
    "it is now largely accepted by astronomers that bright galaxies like the milky way do not have cusped dark haloes today , with some investigators suggesting that feedback from star formation may provide a resolution with cold dark matter theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is _ no _ observational evidence whatsoever that any nearby galaxy has a cusped dark halo profile .",
    "the rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf spiral galaxies have been the subject of a long controversy @xcite .",
    "the effects of beam smearing mean that the h  i rotation curves of many dwarf spirals are broadly compatible with both cores and cusps .",
    "however , the h  ii rotation curves for at least some dwarf spirals are not compatible with cusps @xcite .",
    "most dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) do not contain gas and so the structure of the dark halos must be inferred from stellar motions .",
    "very recently , the survival of kinematically cold substructure in the ursa minor dsph has been used to argue against a cusped halo @xcite . hence , even at the least massive and most dark matter dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum , the predictions of cold dark matter theories concerning halo structure seem to disagree with the observations . nonetheless , for the three nearest dsphs ",
    "draco , sagittarius and canis major  there is no direct evidence either for or against central cusps in their dark matter distribution .",
    "given this weight of evidence , it seems very prudent to use both cored and cusped halo models to estimate the range of the expected @xmath0-ray annihilation signal . in this paper",
    ", we examine four possible locations  the galaxy center and the centers of the three nearest dark - matter dominated dwarf spheroidals ( draco , sagittarius and canis major ) . in section  ii we use the most recent data on the velocity dispersion of the dsphs to constrain a variety of dark halo models , and in section  iii evaluate the @xmath0-ray flux from neutralino self - annihilations .",
    "sections  iv and v summarise the expected contribution from the background and the criterion for detection respectively .",
    "the results for second generation acts and for glast are given in section  vi .",
    "dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) warrant attention because they are amongst the most extreme dark matter dominated environments . for example",
    ", the mass - to - light ratio of draco is @xmath2 in solar units @xcite , while that of the sagittarius is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered possible dsph in canis major seems similar to the sagittarius in structural properties and dark matter content @xcite .",
    "given the seeming absence of dark matter in globular clusters , dsphs are also the smallest systems dominated by dark matter .",
    "we develop two sets of models of dsphs .",
    "the first set is the cored spherical power - law models @xcite : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the core radius and @xmath6 is a velocity scale . when @xmath7 , the model has an asymptotically flat rotation curve and is the cored isothermal sphere .",
    "the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies may be gently rising or falling at large radii , so we also consider models with @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the second set of models is the cusped haloes @xmath10 favored by numerical simulations . here , @xmath11 is the scale radius and @xmath12 is the overall normalisation . when @xmath13 , the model is the highly cusped moore _",
    "@xcite profile , when @xmath14 , the model is the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite .",
    "additionally , we study the case @xmath15 which represents a still milder cusped profile .",
    "the two free parameters determining the shape of the profile are set by fitting to observational data on the draco dsph using the jeans equation @xcite . for a spherical galaxy",
    ", the enclosed mass @xmath16 is related to observables via @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the luminosity density , @xmath19 is the radial velocity dispersion of the stars and @xmath20 is the anisotropy of the stellar motions .",
    "the luminosity density of draco @xmath18 is taken as @xcite : @xmath21 with @xmath22 kpc ( using a heliocentric distance for draco of @xmath23  kpc ) .",
    "there are 6 observational points showing the line of sight velocity dispersion of draco at different radii in @xcite ( using the data with no rotation subtracted ) .",
    "the datapoints are consistent with a flat profile between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . assuming that the anisotropy now vanishes , then the radial velocity dispersion is equal to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion . finally , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitgen ] ) is fitted to the known right - hand side at the locations of the datapoints in @xcite , thus giving estimates for the two unknown parameters for each density profile as quoted in table  [ tb : profile ] .",
    "this algorithm provides models of the draco dsph that satisfy the available observational data .",
    "unfortunately , the radial variation of the velocity dispersion has not been measured for the sagittarius dsph .",
    "however , the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion of sagittarius dsph is 11.4 kms@xmath26 , very similar to that of draco ( 10 kms@xmath26 ) . henceforth , we assume that the underlying structural parameters ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) of the sagittarius dsph are the same as draco .",
    "the third dsph under study ",
    "canis major  has only recently been claimed and the evidence for its existence is not yet clear - cut .",
    "there is certainly a surprising concentration of stars in the direction of canis major , but this could be due to some dynamical feature like an outer spiral arm associated with the milky way disk .",
    "however , for the purposes of this study , we assume the interpretation of the data in terms of a merging dsph is correct and that canis major dsph is similar in size and structure to sagittarius .",
    "to determine the extent of the dark matter halo of the dsphs , the tidal radius must be estimated . the approximate method used",
    "conventionally is derived from the roche criterion .",
    "the tidal radius is found by requiring that the average mass in the dsph is equal to the average interior mass in the milky way halo , namely @xmath29 here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the masses enclosed within radius @xmath32 of the milky way halo and the dwarf spheroidal respectively , while @xmath33 is the distance from the galactic center to the centre of the dsph .",
    "we remark that this is not the same as the procedure used in a number of recent papers @xcite , in which the local density at the tidal radius in the dsph is set equal to the density of the background milky way halo at the center of the dsph .",
    "the results depend on the choice of profile for the milky way halo . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we consider both a cored isothermal profile with @xmath34 kpc and @xmath35 kms@xmath26 , and a nfw profile with concentration parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the total mass of the milky way halo is fixed at @xmath37 , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we show in table  [ tb : profile ] the results when eq .",
    "( [ eq : tidalm ] ) is used to determine the tidal radius of a dsph at the locations of draco and sagittarius , for the two adopted models of the milky way halo .",
    "cored power - law models    .parameters of the dark matter halo profiles of the draco dsph .",
    "the last three columns also give ( in parentheses ) the values at the location of the sagittarius dsph .",
    "two values are given for the tidal radius , according to whether the milky way halo is modelled with an isothermal power - law model or a nfw model .",

    ", we use @xmath41 for the angular average when considering acts ( appropriate for energies @xmath3 gev ) or glast ( 10 gev ) , and @xmath42 for egret ( 10 gev ) . also important",
    "is the observation time , which is chosen as @xmath43  yr for satellites . for the next generation acts , assuming four telescopes",
    ", we use an observation time @xmath44  h and an exposure @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this seems reasonable , as cangaroo @xcite and the last phase of hess @xcite will have four telescopes , while veritas will have as many as seven @xcite .",
    "magic @xcite uses a single 17  m mirror and has roughly the same performance as next - generation acts , but with a reduced threshold of 30 gev .",
    "the following plots show the parts of the supersymmetric parameter space that can be probed through the detection of a @xmath0-ray signal from neutralino annihilations .",
    "we typically show the region to which glast and a generic second generation act will be sensitive .",
    "the plots found in @xcite show the @xmath0-ray flux in @xmath47s@xmath26 against photon energy .",
    "they are not appropriate for depicting the exclusion limits from observations of different parts of the sky because the flux changes and hence so do the points representing theoretical models .",
    "we prefer to use the type of plot presented in @xcite with @xmath48 ( which depends exclusively on the particle physics model ) versus @xmath49 ( although other quantities could be used as well ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : numphotons ] ) , we write the condition for detection in a more convenient way for the plots : @xmath50 here , we see that increasing the angular acceptance @xmath51 can increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "in fact , if both signal and background are constant , the significance increases ( and the minimum value of @xmath52 that can be probed decreases ) as @xmath53 .",
    "however , the signal is not constant as table  [ tb : losint ] shows , and the angular acceptance that maximizes the significance does not necessarily coincide with the minimum angular resolution of the detector .",
    "so the optimal strategy is to scan between the minimum angular resolution and the maximum field of view , choosing the field for which the signal to noise ratio is maximised .",
    "this depends on the position in the sky and on the type of profile .",
    "for instance , the distant draco looks like a point source and the maximum signal is for the smallest angle possible . for sagittarius , the optimal angle is @xmath54 for cored profiles and the smallest possible for cusped profiles . in order not to put too many lines in the plot ,",

    "all the points , bar five , have spin - independent cross - section with protons or neutrons below @xmath62 pb , thus compatible with limits set by the edelweiss nuclear recoil detector , but not the disputed signal claimed by the dama experiment @xcite .",
    "also , the upward - going , neutrino - originated , muon showers have a flux of @xmath63 km@xmath64 yr@xmath26 ( which according to kurylov and kamionkowski @xcite is the limit set by super - kamiokande ) .",
    "as the figure shows , the discrete annihilation line is very unlikely to be observed , even with the next generation instruments .",
    "it is just about detectable for the most promising targets under the most optimistic assumptions ",

    "in particular , monochromatic lines from the galactic center are not visible to glast .",
    "the difference between this work and that of @xcite is that the latter authors took a very high dark matter concentration in the center ( the profile is just nfw , but the constant in front is set to ensure maximal flux given two weak constraints on the mass and the rotation curve ) .",

    "the continuum emission above 1 gev can yield some constraints . although we have computed the curves for four targets ( draco , sagittarius , canis major and the galactic centre ) and for the full range of models in section ii , we give only the most promising results in the figures .",
    "the draco , sagittarius and canis major dsphs may yield interesting constraints  but only if their dark halo profiles are strongly cusped ( the moore and the nfw profiles both rule out some supersymmetric models ) .",
    "unlike the case of the milky way , cusped profiles are still possible for the dsphs .",
    "notice , however , that substituting cored power - law models for nfw or moore profiles causes the exclusion limit to move well above the supersymmetric parameter space of interest . for @xmath65 gev ,",

    ", the galaxy has been modelled with an isothermal power - law model , as opposed to the cusped models preferred by stoehr _",

    "_ that this is a promising target , as _ irrespective of whether the galaxy is cusped or cored _ , there are always useful constraints on the supersymmetric parameters",
    ". unfortunately , this attractive option is only available to glast and not for acts .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] shows the prospects for detection of continuum emission above 50 gev . for acts ,",
    "the canis dsph is the best target , though a detectable signal will again only be measured if the density profile is strongly cusped . for glast",
    ", the galaxy at medium latitudes again leads to some constraints , though not as strong as when continuum emission above 50 gev is studied .",
    "if the dark matter present in the universe is composed at least in part by the lightest supersymmetric particle , then this could manifest itself via @xmath0-ray emission from pair annihilations .",
    "it is clearly important to estimate the likely magnitude of the neutralino annihilation signal .",
    "it is also important to identify the likely locations and spectral rgimes in which the signal should be sought .",
    "this paper has provided new estimates of the signal towards the galactic center and the nearby dwarf spheroidals using a variety of models .",
    "there have been a number of recent calculations predicting that the neutralino annihilation flux from the inner galaxy will be detectable with forthcoming satellites like glast and with second generation atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( acts ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations assume that the cusped navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) models for the milky way halo hold good .",
    "this assumption is in contradiction with a substantial body of astrophysical evidence about the inner galaxy @xcite . in any case , even if the milky way halo was originally of nfw form , the formation of the disk and bulge will have reprocessed the primordial dark matter distribution @xcite . in contradiction with earlier results",
    ", we do not find the prospects of detecting the annihilation flux from the galactic center to be particularly promising .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-ray line coming from the the @xmath67 and @xmath68 final states is not detectable either with second generation acts or with the glast satellite .",
    "_ we caution that many of the recent estimates of high flux are sensitively dependent on the assumptions made regarding the innermost structure of the dark halo .",
    "even the best numerical simulations have difficulty in resolving structures on scales less than 1 kpc , and so the inner profile is always found by extrapolation .",
    "_    the high mass - to - light ratios of the local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) makes them attractive targets .",
    "cusped profiles like nfw are not presently ruled out for dsphs like sagittarius or draco .",
    "it may be that the visible dwarf galaxy lies entirely within the central parts of a cusped dark matter halo .",
    "if so , then the optimum targets are the sagittarius and canis major dsphs .",
    "the detection of monochromatic lines is still extremely difficult , but the glast satellite may detect excess continuum @xmath0 ray emission .",
    "this is of course a less distinctive feature than a sharp line .",
    "in particular , if the sagittarius or canis major dsphs have a strongly cusped dark halo profile ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) , then some regions of supersymmetric parameter space can be ruled out .",
    "again , however , this conclusion only holds good if the dark halo profile is cusped .",
    "using a cored isothermal - like model for the dark halo , even the sagittarius and canis major dsphs may be invisible to glast and second generation acts .",
    "unlike bergstrom _",
    "@xcite , we do not find the galactic center to be a promising location . partly , this is because we believe that the milky way does _ not _ have a strongly cusped profile based on the available astrophysical evidence @xcite . partly , this is because bergstrom et al . chose a generous overall normalisation anyhow  they used the nfw model corresponding to the maximum flux which satisfies two weak constraints on the mass and the rotation curve .",
    "accordingly , the local dark matter density is as high as @xmath71 gev @xmath72 in their model . when the circular velocity curve of such a halo is combined with that for the disk and bar",
    ", then it necessarily violates the constraint on the galactic rotation curve in the inner parts .",
    "one important caveat of our results  however  is that the possible effects of a central black hole are not included in our calculations . here",
    ", we merely note that the observability of any expected signal depends on the manner in which the black hole grows @xcite .",
    "stoehr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also recently emphasised that the @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic center may have been overestimated by the use of too strongly cusped profiles .",
    "they suggest that the galaxy at moderate latitudes ( @xmath73 may also be a good target for detecting the continuum emission ( they do not study the line emission ) . this is not really an option for acts with their small field of view . however , _ it is an attractive possibility for glast , as the continuum emission is detectable irrespective of uncertainties in halo structure . _ for acts , the best targets remain the sagittarius and canis major dsphs .",
    "very recently , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has been suggested as another likely target @xcite .",
    "judging from @xcite , the average mass to light ratio of the lmc within 8.9 kpc is only @xmath74 ( as opposed to @xmath3 for the compact dsphs ) .",
    "this is an upper limit to the central mass to light ratio .",
    "in other words , much as in the milky way , dark matter dominates the outer parts of the lmc and is responsible for the asymptotic flatness of the ratio curve . however , the central parts of the lmc are dominated by the luminous bar and disk .",
    "the assumption that the dark halo dominates the gravitational potential everywhere is therefore not valid .",
    "hence , the procedure used in @xcite of fitting the rotation curve to a nfw dark halo is flawed .",
    "the gravitational potential of the gas and stellar disk and bar simply can not be ignored in the central regions .",

    "<S> we show that the annihilation signal from the galactic centre falls by two orders of magnitude on substituting a cored dark matter density profile for a cusped one . the present and future generation of high energy @xmath0-ray detectors , whether atmospheric cerenkov telescopes or space missions like glast , lack the sensitivity to detect any of the monochromatic @xmath0-ray annihilation lines </S>",
    "<S> . the continuum @xmath0-ray signal above 1 gev and above 50 gev may however be detectable either from the dwarf spheroidals or from the milky way itself . if the density profiles of the dwarf spheroidals are cusped , then the best prospects are for detecting sagittarius and canis major . however , if the dwarf spheroidals have milder , cored profiles , then the annihilation signal is not detectable . for glast , </S>",
