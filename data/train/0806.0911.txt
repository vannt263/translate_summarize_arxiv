    "the discovery of superconductivity in the layered cobalt oxide na@xmath10co@xmath11yh@xmath12o @xcite has stimulated further interest in the electronic states of the mother compound na@xmath1coo@xmath0 .",
    "the specific features of the system are the geometrical fluctuation of the coo@xmath0 plane which consists of a triangular lattice of co atoms , and the orbital degeneracy of @xmath13 bands of co @xmath14 electrons .",
    "the electron filling in the coo@xmath0 plane is controlled by changing the na content @xmath15 : the hole concentration of co @xmath13 bands is given by @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath17 , na@xmath1coo@xmath0 is a normal paramagnetic metal , while , for @xmath18 , an anomalous behavior is observed : the magnetic susceptibility @xmath19 is curie - weiss like although the resistivity is metallic @xcite , the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath20 is large and increases with @xmath15 @xcite , the thermopower is unusually large @xcite . for @xmath21 , a weak magnetic order is observed below 20k @xcite , where the ferromagnetic ordered coo@xmath0 layers couple antiferromagnetically with each other @xcite .",
    "furthermore , na@xmath22coo@xmath0 exhibits a remarkable successive phase transition at @xmath23 k and @xmath24 k @xcite : the in - plane antiferromagnetic order is realized below @xmath25 and the system becomes insulator below @xmath26 . from the nmr and the neutron measurements , yokoi _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed the magnetic structure of na@xmath22coo@xmath0 , where chains of co@xmath27 with larger staggered moment and co@xmath28 with smaller moment exist alternatively within the coo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the charge ordering of the co sites into chains of co@xmath27 and co@xmath28 is closely related to the ordered pattern of na ions which form one - dimensional chains below room temperature @xcite . in spite of the intense effort devoted in the last few years , the origin of metal - insulator transition at @xmath26 is still an open question .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the electronic state of the coo@xmath0 plane including the successive phase transition of na@xmath22coo@xmath0 , particularly focused on the effect of the one - dimensional na order on the antiferromagnetism . for this purpose , we take into account of an effective one - dimensional potential on the coo@xmath0 plane due to the effect of the na order .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows ; in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the model hamiltonian for the coo@xmath12 plane . in sec . 3 ,",
    "results of the calculation are presented . finally , we summarize the results of the present work in sec .",
    "to investigate the electronic states of the coo@xmath0 plane in the layered cobalt oxides na@xmath10coo@xmath0 , we employ the two dimensional triangular lattice @xmath29-@xmath30 model which includes 11 orbitals : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 of co and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) of o in the upper ( lower ) side of a co plane .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by ; @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is a creation operator for a cobalt @xmath14 electron with wave vector @xmath45 ( site @xmath46 ) , orbital @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) and spin @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a creation operator for a oxygen @xmath55 electron with wave vector @xmath45 , site @xmath56 , orbital @xmath57 ( @xmath15 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and spin @xmath53 , respectively . in eqs .",

    "( [ eq - model6 ] ) , the sum run over the nearest neighbor pairs @xmath65 over all lattice sites .    in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq - model ] ) , we consider the effects of the intra - atomic coulomb interaction at a co site : the intra- and inter - orbital direct terms @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the exchange coupling @xmath4 and the pair - transfer @xmath5 @xcite , and effects of the inter - atomic coulomb interaction between the nearest neighbor co sites @xmath8 . here and hereafter , we assume the rotational invariance yielding the relations : @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the effect of the one - dimensional na order , in which na ions form one - dimensional chains at @xmath6 , is considered by taking into account an effective one - dimensional potential on the coo@xmath0 plane : @xmath68 with the effective potential @xmath7 due to the na order . because a part of the effect of the inter - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath8 enhances @xmath7 , @xmath8 is corrected so as not to influence @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter , in order to consider the both na order and the antiferromagnetic order , we use an extended unit cell including four co atoms and eight o atoms , together with the magnetic brillouin zone which is @xmath69 of the original brillouin zone .",
    "now we discuss possible ordered states including magnetic , charge and orbital ordered states in the case of @xmath6 within the hartree - fock approximation @xcite . in this study , we assume that the order parameters are diagonal with respect to the orbital @xmath47 and the spin @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig - struct](a ) shows a possible order pattern of the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "chains of co 3.5+@xmath70 and co 3.5-@xmath70 exist alternatingly within the coo@xmath0 plane because of the one - dimensional na order @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - struct](b ) shows an order pattern of the coexistence state of antiferromagnetic , charge and orbital order , where the co sites out of the na ordered line with the valency of 3.5+@xmath70 have the antiferromagnetic moment @xcite , while , the co sites on the na ordered line with the valency of 3.5-@xmath70 show the charge order which is accompanied by the orbital order out of the na ordered line .",
    "the coexistence state of the antiferromagnetic and charge order without the orbital order has not been obtained in the present calculation .",
    "figure [ fig - phase](a ) shows the sublattice magnetization @xmath47 , charge order @xmath71 , orbital order @xmath72 and the density of states at fermi level @xmath73 as functions of @xmath2 with @xmath74 ev , temperature @xmath75 k and the effective potential @xmath76 ev .",
    "the phase transition of antiferromagnetic ordered state occurs at @xmath77 ev . with increasing @xmath2 , sublattice magnetization @xmath47 increases , while , the density of states @xmath73 is almost constant .",
    "due to the effect of the one - dimensional potential , the band structure becomes quasi one - dimensional and the fermi surface nesting is enhanced as shown in fig .",

    "( 2 ) the insulating coexistence state between antiferromagnetic , charge and orbital ordered state for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it is found that the one - dimensional na order enhances the fermi surface nesting around m and m  points resulting in the antiferromagnetic order which is suppressed due to the frustration effect in the case without the na order . in the present work ,",
    "the antiferromagnetism and the orbital order according to the charge order due to the effect of @xmath8 are strengthened each other , and the coexistence state is obtained .",
    "however , there is a possibility that the coexistence state is obtained only due to the effect of @xmath2 without @xmath8 , where the cooperation between the antiferromagnetic order and the orbital order is a crucial role .",
