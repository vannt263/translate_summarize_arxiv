    "the strange nonchaotic attractor ( sna ) is an object that has chaotic attractor features like fractal dimension and nondifferentiability ( strangeness ) but no exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , i.e. , its largest lyapunov exponent is nonpositive @xcite .",
    "it has some analogies with trajectories that have been found in a study of the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite and of the chirikov - taylor map @xcite .",
    "aubry has shown @xcite that the incommensurate ground - states of the frenkel - kontorova model can undergo a _ breaking of analiticity transition _ , between a smooth and a fractal set .",
    "shenker and kadanoff @xcite calculated the fractal power spectrum of the fractal trajectory that appears in the chirikov - taylor map after the breakup of a kam - like surface a fractal power spectrum .",
    "this map can be related to an incommensurate driving of a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "another example is the accumulation point of the period - doubling cascade of the logistic map @xcite .",
    "however , this attractor occurs in a zero measure set in the parameter space .",
    "sna as a typical behavior , a finite measure set in the parameter space of a model , has been found in the context of nonlinear quasiperiodic external forcing ( i.e. , the forcing of a signal with two incommensurate frequencies ) @xcite .",
    "the study of the sna has also been recently connected with the localization problem @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been done in order to characterize the features of a sna ; its route of formation , autocorrelation function and power spectrum .",
    "besides a period - doubling cascade , many different routes for the formation of an sna have been proposed : ( 1 ) the collision between a period - doubled torus and its unstable parent torus @xcite ; ( 2 ) the progressive fractalization of a two - dimensional ergodic torus @xcite and , ( 3 ) for systems with quasiperiodic tori in symmetric invariant subspaces , the loss of the transverse stability of a torus @xcite .",
    "another particular feature of the sna is that its autocorrelation function does not decay with the time delay like that of the chaotic attrator .",
    "it can either be fractal or similar to the quasiperiodic case @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of a sna can be singular continuous and in this case has fractal features as discussed in many papers @xcite    the aim of this paper is to answer the question : are snas restricted to quasiperiodically driven nonlinear systems ?",
    "we believe that the answer is no .",
    "we studied a map ( hereafter called yos map ) that has been proposed in the magnetic context to describe the behavior of an analog of the annni model on the bethe lattice @xcite and which shows , for external periodic forcing , the occurrence of a sna @xcite .",
    "the same map exhibits typical features of a neuron ( like activation threshold , nerve blocking and _ rebound _ behavior ) and has been coined as a dynamical perceptron of second order ( related to the dimension two of the map ) , because it corresponds to a two - layer recurrent neural network @xcite .",
    "independently , kanter _",
    "@xcite proposed a recurrence relation scheme known as a _ sequence generator _ , which is essentially the same map , generalized for any number of dimensions .",
    "this map can also be viewed as a discrete - time , nonlinear oscillator , for some values of the parameters .",

    "_ @xcite have claimed that they found a sna through periodic driving of a map , but pikovsky _ et al .",

    "_ claimed the attractor is strange nonchaotic .",
    "they found a null largest lyapunov exponent within the numerical accuracy of the method they used .",
    "a positive definite largest lyapunov exponent corresponds to an exponential expansion of an hypercube of initial conditions in at least one of the directions of the phase space . in other terms",
    ", we can study the sign of the largest lyapunov exponent of a map by studying the stretching and contraction of a hypercube of initial conditions . here",
    "we present a simpler version of this procedure , studying only the evolution of the distance between trajectories generated by only two initial conditions .",
    "we take two different sets of initial values of ( x , y , u , v ) and calculate the distance @xmath24 between the trajectories generated by each set , as the number of iterations is increased .",
    "that is perhaps the navest way to investigate the largest lyapunov exponent of a map .",

    "figure [ lyapanish ] represents the first 30 000 iterations of the evolution of d(n ) .",
    "we can see at first sight that the system is chaotic , since the distance between the trajectories with different initial conditions grows exponentially .",
    "a simple estimation of the slope of the rugged curve leads to @xmath27 for the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath28 , where we have assumed that the behavior of the distance is governed by this exponent and given by @xmath29 this result agrees with surprising accuracy with that obtained by pikovsky and feudel @xcite , using the wolf - swift - swinney - vastano algorithm @xcite .",
