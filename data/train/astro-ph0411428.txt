    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are formed through dynamic interactions between the current fast stellar wind and previous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) wind @xcite ; thus , the interior of a pn is filled with shocked fast wind . this hot interior gas and the cool nebular shell form a contact discontinuity where heat conduction @xcite is expected to occur .",
    "the resulting mass evaporation from the dense nebular shell into the hot interior lowers the temperature and raises the density of the hot gas @xcite , significantly increasing the x - ray emissivity .",
    "hydrodynamic models of pne with heat conduction predict x - ray emission that should be easily detectable with modern x - ray observatories @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have indeed detected diffuse x - ray emission from pne , with plasma temperatures of @xmath1  k and x - ray luminosities of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the limb - brightened x - ray morphology and the low plasma temperatures are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of models with heat conduction ; however , the observed @xmath4 are generally too low . for example , the observed @xmath4 of ngc6543 , @xmath5 ergs  s@xmath3 @xcite , is an order of magnitude lower than that modeled by @xcite . similar discrepancies between observed and modeled @xmath4 have been seen in wolf - rayet bubbles ( e.g. , ngc6888 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and superbubbles ( e.g. , m17 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that this problem may be associated with thermal conduction per se .    thermal conduction has been assumed in theoretical models but not constrained empirically through observation because interfaces at a few @xmath6  k require difficult uv observations . traditionally interfaces have been studied using spectral lines of , , and ; however , these species can be photoionized by hot stars ( especially pn central stars with effective temperatures @xmath7100,000  k ) and the detection of these narrow absorption lines can be hampered by the stellar p  cygni profile and confused by interstellar absorption lines .",
    "we have chosen to study the interface layer in the pn ngc6543 using  emission because the physical properties of its interior hot gas have been established by _",

    "( _ fuse _ ) observations of ngc6543 have been made and  emission is indeed detected . in this paper",
    "we describe the observations and data processing in  2 , present the results in  3 , and discuss their implications in  4 .",
    "we have observed ngc6543 with _ fuse _  to search for nebular   emission .",
    "the _ fuse _  observatory has four spectrographs operating simultaneously to cover the 9051187   wavelength range with high resolution , @xmath920,000 .",
    "details of the design and performance of the _ fuse _  spectrographs are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "three observations of ngc6543 were obtained in the time - tag mode using the hirs aperture ( 125@xmath1020 ) : `` n - cav '' samples the northern edge of the central cavity , `` n - ext '' the northern extension of the cavity , and `` off '' a region outside the nebula at 150  north of the central star ( see fig .  1 for their locations ) .",
    "additional observations of the central star , available in the archive and referred to as cs , used the mdrs aperture ( 4@xmath1020 ) and were acquired in the histogram mode .    due to flexure of the instrument ,",
    "only the lif1 detector segment remains fixed with respect to a position on the sky throughout an orbit .",
    "thus , we only analyzed observations obtained with the lif1a detector segment .",
    "the individual exposures were reprocessed using the _ fuse _   calibration pipeline software , calfuse ( version 2.4.0 ) , to extract a 1-dimensional spectrum for each exposure .",
    "the observations of the central star obtained in histogram mode were also processed using the calfuse pipeline with its default settings .",
    "the diagnostics produced by the calfuse pipeline were examined to ensure that the spectral extraction window was properly centered , and to exclude burst / flare events and periods when the central star drifted into the hirs aperture .",
    "spectral drift between exposures was removed by cross - correlating the individual exposures relative to the longest exposure .",
    "the typical offset found was generally less than 1 pixel ( @xmath00.0067 ) and never more than 5 pixels .",
    "the individual exposures for each position were then weighted by their exposure times and combined .",
    "the coadded spectra for the n - cav , n - ext , off , and cs positions had total effective exposure times of 14.4 , 13.7 , 37.3 , and 2.3 ks , respectively .",
    "the four _ fuse _  spectra of ngc6543 are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the cs spectrum shows very broad p cygni profile of the stellar  lines with numerous interstellar absorption lines of h@xmath11 and low ionization ions .",
    "the off position shows only airglow lines of ly@xmath12 and .",
    "in contrast , the spectra at the n - cav and n - ext show prominent narrow emission lines of @xmath131036,1037 , broad emission lines of   @xmath131032,1038 , and a broad unidentified emission line at 1034.432  , superposed on continuum emission that has a spectral shape similar to that of the cs .    the continuum emission in the nebular spectra is most likely stellar emission scattered by dust in the nebular gas . to remove this contamination ,",
    "we have scaled the stellar spectrum by factors of 0.018 and 0.0075 and subtracted it from the nebular spectra of n - cav and n - ext , respectively .",
    "an expanded view of the  lines in figure 3 shows that the continuum contamination is effectively removed and the weaker  @xmath141038 line becomes more prominent .",
    "we determine the centroid velocity and fwhm of each line by fitting a gaussian profile , but measure the line intensity by direct summation .",
    "the  @xmath141038 line flux and shape should be regarded with some skepticism because the emission line is close to a strong absorption line and is in a spectral region where the p  cygni profile from the central star may be oversubtracted .",

    "we further assume a constant agb mass loss , resulting in a radial density profile @xmath31 for the circumstellar medium .",
    "the dynamics of such a bubble can be solved analytically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is characterized by a pressure and age which can be expressed in terms of observed quantities such as the fast stellar wind terminal velocity and mass loss rate , and the nebular shell size and expansion velocity . to calculate the temperature and density structure at the interface layer , radiative losses and thermal conduction are considered by numerically solving the continuity and energy equations ( i.e. , equations ( 42 ) and ( 43 ) of * ? ? ?",

    "3 ) ; for an inclination angle of 35@xmath34 @xcite the expansion velocity will be @xmath040 km  s@xmath3 .    use of these observational parameters results in an analytic solution with a nebular age of @xmath01000 yrs and a pressure in the central cavity of @xmath03@xmath1010@xmath35 dyne  @xmath36 .",
    "if we compare these values with independent estimates we find that the age is reasonable for ngc6543 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the pressure is roughly a factor of 10 higher than indicated by observations of both the cool nebular shell and the hot gas interior .",

    "likewise , using the method outlined later , we find the expected emission to be @xmath010 times higher than observed . both of these discrepencies arise from the incorrect model prediction of pressure within the central cavity , and are likely caused by incorrect assumptions about the fast and agb wind mass loss rates .    to obtain an alternative estimate of the emission we consider the observed pressure in the nebular shell and hot interior . in the nebular shell @xcite",
