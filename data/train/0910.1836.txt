    "studies of the history of star formation and mass assembly in galaxies requires samples of galaxies over a range of lookback times . since large spectroscopic surveys of purely magnitude - limited samples ( e.g. , vvds , le fvre et al .",
    "2004 ) become progressively less efficient at probing higher redshifts , a variety of photometric criteria have been developed to efficiently select distant galaxies .",
    "the application of one or combination of several of these criteria should allow us to construct samples that are representative for the whole galaxy population at the considered redshift .",
    "the lyman - break technique ( steidel & hamilton 1993 ) was the first to be routinely used , identifying relatively unobscured , actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 based on their rest - frame uv colors .",
    "similar criteria were designed to probe star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , referred to as bx and bm galaxies respectively ( adelberger et al .",
    "the advent of near - infrared ( nir ) instruments on 8 - 10 m class telescopes encouraged the study of nir - selected galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the nir flux is less affected by dust obscuration and small amounts of recent star formation and is therefore a better tracer of stellar mass than the optical fluxes .",
    "the two most commonly used color criteria in the nir to probe distant galaxies are based on the bzk bands ( daddi et al . 2004 , identifying galaxies at @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 color ( franx et al .",
    "2003 , designed to select red galaxies at @xmath6 ) .",
    "the latter class of galaxies , so - called distant red galaxies ( drgs ) , are characterized by the simple color criterion @xmath14 .",
    "they are found to be massive ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) systems ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 ; frster schreiber et al . 2004 ) and range from dusty star - forming to quiescent types ( labb et al . 2005 ; papovich et al . 2006 ; kriek et al . 2006 ; wuyts et al .",

    ", spectroscopic confirmation is indispensable .",
    "the high - redshift nature of a color - selected population can only be directly verified by measuring redshifts from their spectra . apart from establishing the redshift range probed",
    ", the presence of emission and/or absorption lines provides valuable information on the nature of the galaxies .",
    "moreover , having a spectroscopic redshift reduces the number of free parameters in spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling by one and allows for a more accurate determination of the rest - frame colors .",
    "finally , the availability of spectroscopic redshifts allows us to address the quality of photometric redshift estimates , on which many analyses of the high - redshift galaxy population rely .",
    "large samples of optically selected galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed and their stellar populations , metallicity and kinematics such as large - scale outflows have been studied extensively based on the obtained optical and nir spectra ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; shapley et al . 2003 ; erb et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the samples of nir - selected distant galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation to date are considerably smaller , the reason being twofold .",
    "first , their faint nature in the rest - frame uv makes optical spectroscopic follow - up challenging .",
    "second , nir spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. , kriek et al .",
    "2006 ) is time - consuming due to the lack of nir multi - object spectrographs and the brightness of the night sky at @xmath17 m .",
    "especially the number of spectroscopically confirmed drgs to date is limited , and their redshifts were often obtained by surveys with other selection criteria ( e.g. , reddy et al .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "sources for optical spectroscopy were selected with the simple color criterion @xmath21 ( drgs ) and , with lower priority , galaxies with @xmath22 and @xmath23 were placed in the masks .",
    "the masks were usually shared with other high - redshift candidates and bright fillers .",
    "finally , 11 sources selected by their flux excess in a narrow - band filter centered at 4190   were placed in one of the masks targeting the 054 field . in some rare cases ,",
    "targets were selected with @xmath21 in an older catalog , and have @xmath24 in the final catalog .",
    "this explains why objects # 1195 and # 1458 from vd03 are not part of the drg sample presented in this paper .",
    "a total of 64 drgs were placed in the spectroscopic masks , all of them having @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ vkvsv.fig ] illustrates their location ( _ large symbols _ ) in a @xmath26 versus @xmath27 color - magnitude diagram with respect to all drgs with @xmath28 ( _ small symbols _ ) in the three fields .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the drgs selected for optical spectroscopic follow - up span the whole 5 magnitudes in @xmath26 color occupied by the total drg sample .",
    "furthermore , they exhibit a similar range of @xmath27 magnitudes , with a median @xmath27 of 26.3 .",
    "the cdfs - goods field is likely the most heavily studied deep field on the sky .",
    "several spectroscopic surveys have been conducted , each with their own selection criteria , resulting in a vast database of spectroscopic redshifts from nearby to the most distant currently attainable .",
    "we cross - correlated our fireworks @xmath7-band selected catalog for the cdfs field with an up - to - date list of reliable redshifts , most of which were provided by goods - fors2 ( v3.0 , vanzella et al .",
    "2008 ) , the k20 survey ( mignoli et al . 2005 ) , the vvds survey ( le fvre et al . 2004 ) , the cxo survey ( szokoly et al . 2004 ) , the gmass survey ( cimatti et al .",

    "since different photometric criteria were applied to select these objects ( e.g. , an x - ray selection for the cxo survey ) , the spectroscopically confirmed drgs in the literature are not necessarily representative for the whole population of galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore decide to mark them throughout the paper as having spectroscopic redshifts , but treat them as a seperate class , i.e. , they are not taken into account to compute the fraction of @xmath2 interlopers or to estimate the agn fraction based on the optical spectra .",

    "the 400 lines mm@xmath30 grism ( 3400   blaze ) was used on the blue arm and the 400 lines mm@xmath30 grating ( 8500   blaze ) on the red arm .",
    "the d680 dichroic was used in january 2003 , whereas in march and november 2003 the d560 dichroic was inserted .",
    "the total exposure time with lris , spread over 2 masks in 054 and one in cdfs , amounted to 30.5 ks .",
    "series of 3 or 4 exposures ( typically 1800 s each ) , dithered in @xmath31 steps along the slit , enabled a more efficient sky subtraction .    in january 2003 , we observed 054 with deimos using a 600 lines mm@xmath30 grism in conjunction with the gg495 order - blocking filter .",
    "the exposure time was 18 ks .",
    "two other masks , containing a handful of @xmath32 objects as fillers , were exposed for 36.24 ks altogether . for the latter the grism",
    "was blazed at 7700   and the og550 filter was inserted .",
    "similar to the lris observations , we dithered along the slit .",
    "fors2 observations with the grism gris_300v , partly in combination with filter gg375 , took place in september 2002 , december 2002 , march 2003 and october 2003 .",
    "a total of 88.37 ks exposure time was spread over masks in the hdfs , 054 and the cdfs .",
    "the same dithering strategy as for the lris spectroscopy was used . in september 2003 , we observed the hdfs with the gmos spectrograph on gemini south . in order to allow for smaller slit lengths and consequently a larger number of objects in the mask ,",
    "no dithering was applied along the slit . instead , a 600 lines mm@xmath30 grating was blazed at 4500   during half of the exposures and at 4530 during the second half .",
    "for all drgs observed with gmos we obtained 28.8 ks total exposures . one red galaxy was exposed for an additional 9.6 ks as a filler in a mask with optically brighter objects .    using the described instrument settings",
    ", we obtained spectra for a total of 64 drgs . no slits containing drgs",
    "were lost due to failures in the reduction process or other technical problems .",
    "exposure times per object varied from a minimum of 7.9 ks to a maximum of 75.34 ks . in the course of the 9 observing runs seeing conditions were highly variable , ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , with a typical value of @xmath35 .",
    "the 1 to 1.1@xmath36 wide slits gave a typical resolution of 7.5  , 3.6  , 10.5   and 4.6   ( fwhm ) for lris , deimos , fors2 , and gmos respectively .",
    "multi - object spectroscopic data obtained by lris , deimos , fors2 and gmos generally undergo the same reduction steps . for a detailed description of the standard lris reduction process , we refer the reader to van dokkum & stanford ( 2003 ) .",
    "briefly , the observations were divided in sessions of four dithered exposures .",
    "we used standard iraf tasks to subtract the bias and apply the flatfielding and fringe correction to each of the slit exposures .",
    "next , cosmic rays were cleaned and skylines subtracted .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on arc lamp images , and we used the location of a bright skyline to apply a zero - point correction . finally , the 4 reduced slit exposures were aligned , averaged , and the s - distortion was removed .",
    "the part of the slit where the target object ( and possibly a second object ) is located , needs to be masked during several reduction steps .",
    "it is of great importance that the correct part of the slit is masked .",
    "as the nir - selected galaxies are extremely faint in the optical , it is impossible to measure their positions in the slit on the raw science frames .",
    "we determined the object position in the slit from the mask design and verified the predicted position for bright filler objects on the raw science frames .",
    "the maskwidth was set to @xmath37 .    in the case of the gmos run , where no dithering was applied ,",
    "the use of 2 gratings blazed at 4500   and 4530   helped to distinguish hot pixels ( at fixed ccd position ) from real spectral features ( at fixed wavelength ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of dithering resulted in a lower quality of the spectra .",
    "ten out of 64 drgs targeted by our survey were observed only with gmos .",
    "drgs , while prominent in the nir , are generally very faint at optical wavelengths , which probe their rest - frame uv emission .",
    "the median @xmath27 magnitude of all drgs targeted by our spectroscopic survey is 26.3 , and that of the subsample for which a redshift was successfully identified is 25.8 . given their faint nature in the rest - frame uv , it comes as no surprise that continua , if detected , have a too low signal - to - noise ratio to allow for redshift identifications based on absorption lines .",
    "therefore , all spectroscopic redshifts for drgs in our sample are based on emission lines .",
    "we measured their central wavelength using the iraf splot task . in cases where only a single emission line was detected , we use the following arguments to favor  over [ oii]3727 as identification :",
    "the presence of a break ( lower continuum on the blue side of the spectral feature ) , and absence of features at the wavelength where one would expect h@xmath38 and [ oiii]5007 if the emission line were [ oii]3727 . the typical redshift uncertainty is @xmath39 , as estimated from the dispersion of repeated splot measurements of emission line wavelengths of galaxies whose emission line(s ) were detected in multiple independent observations .    out of 64 galaxies satisfying the drg criterion without further selection bias , the optical spectroscopic follow - up resulted in 14 redshift identifications ( a success rate of 22% ) .",
    "furthermore , nir spectroscopy with nirspec ( mclean et al . 1998 ) on the w. m. keck telescope presented by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provided a redshift for one targeted drg that did not show emission lines in its optical spectrum .",
    "the 15 redshifts for purely @xmath13 selected drgs are listed in table  [ ours.tab ] .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts obtained for 49 non - drgs during our spectroscopic campaign are listed in table[nondrg.tab ] .",
    "we investigate a possible bias of the subsample of drgs with a successful redshift determination in figure  [ vkvsv.fig ] .",
    "the 15 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies that were selected purely on the basis of their red ( @xmath14 ) color are plotted with large filled circles .",
    "the other drgs targeted by our survey are marked with large empty circles . with smaller circles ,",
    "we plot all other drgs with @xmath25 in the observed fields ( _ small empty circles _ ) and the subsample for which a redshift was obtained by other spectroscopic surveys ( _ small grey circles _ ) .",
    "the successful targets in our spectroscopic campaign of drgs are biased toward brighter magnitudes in both @xmath40 and @xmath7 with respect to both the whole spectroscopically observed sample and the complete sample of drgs in the three considered fields .",
    "one could expect a bias toward brighter magnitudes based on signal - to - noise arguments .",
    "however , the possible presence of emission lines makes the relation between success rate and broad - band flux less direct .",
    "a redshift may be more easily obtained from a faint emission line spectrum than from a brighter absorption spectrum .",
    "we discuss the spectral types in  [ spectype.sec ] .",
    "remarkably , figure[vkvsv.fig ] suggests a larger dependence of the success rate on the @xmath41 magnitude than on the @xmath27 magnitude , even though the spectra were obtained in the optical .",
    "out of the 10 ( 20 ) brightest targeted drgs in @xmath41 , a redshift was successfully derived from the optical spectra for 60% ( 45% ) of them . considering the brightest 10 ( 20 ) targets in @xmath27",
    ", the success rates drop to 50% ( 25% ) .",
    "as noted before , all redshifts were based on the presence of emission lines .",
    "although caution should be taken due to small number statistics and variable seeing conditions between the observing runs , this might hint toward an increasing prevalence of drgs with  emission with brighter @xmath7-band flux .",
    "figure  [ onedspec.fig ] presents the 1d spectra of our successful redshift identifications . as stated in  [ successbias.sec ] , continua ,",
    "if detected , have a very low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "since all spectroscopic redshifts for drgs in our sample are based on emission lines , we should keep in mind that we are likely dealing with a biased representation of the whole population of galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "at least 22% of drgs show line emission bright enough to be detected in several hours exposure time on a 8 - 10 m telescope .",
    "the remaining sources may lack emission lines , or have a redshift that places the emission lines outside the covered wavelength range ( see  [ zdistribution.sec ] ) .",
    "we note that , for a sample of k - bright galaxies at @xmath10 , many of which are drgs , kriek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that @xmath42% lack emission lines in their nir spectra ( equivalent width h@xmath43 10  ) .",
    "galaxies m-203 and m-508 show [ oii]3727 in emission at @xmath44 .",
    "all other spectra presented in figure  [ onedspec.fig ] feature  in emission , possibly in combination with interstellar absorption lines ( c-5442 ) or confirmed by nv , siiv , civ and other emission lines indicating the presence of an agn ( c-1787 , c-2659 ) .",
    "the presence of  indicates that at least a quarter of the drgs must host regions of star formation that are not heavily obscured , complementary to an old underlying or dusty young population that according to sed modeling ( e.g. , labb et al . 2005 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2007 ; williams et al .",
    "2009 ) is responsible for their red rest - frame optical color .",
    "differences between the rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical morphologies of drgs also indicate that these galaxies do not have homogeneous stellar populations ( toft et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as illustrated by the inset 2d gmos spectrum of h-66 in figure[onedspec.fig ]",
    ", a smaller feature is visible near the emission line of the target , offset from h-66 in the spatial direction by @xmath45 and in the wavelength direction by 13.7  .",
    "the relatively high dispersion of gmos allows for an accurate measurement of the emission line centers : 5330.8   ( h-66 ) and 5317.1 (serendipitous object ) . interpreting both lines as  at identical cosmological distance , the shift in wavelength corresponds to a relative velocity of @xmath46 km s@xmath30 . at @xmath47",
    "the projected spatial offset corresponds to 2.6 kpc .    at 4781 ",
    "was detected in both the lris and 2 fors2 spectra of m-1061 .",
    "however , the spectrum is offset by @xmath48 from the predicted position in the slit as calculated from the center of the k - band flux .",
    "an identical offset is measured between the centers of flux on the @xmath49- and @xmath7-band images .",
    "whether the optical and nir light correspond to different parts of the same galaxy , or come from physically unrelated sources , remains uncertain .",
    "nir spectroscopy could confirm the redshift of the drg unambiguously if  is detected at @xmath50 m . at @xmath51",
    "the offset of @xmath48 corresponds to 11.6 kpc .",
    "we verified that our results would not be affected by excluding m-1061 from our spectroscopic redshift sample .",
    "c-1787 was also observed by norman et al .",
    "these authors found that at @xmath52 , c-1787 was the most distant type-2 qso known at the time of discovery , showing a bright x - ray counterpart in the 1 ms chandra imaging of the cdfs .",
    "the detection of ovi , , nv , siiv , niv , civ , heii , and ciii in our fors2 spectrum of the source confirms its nature .      interpreting a detection of civ in emission as evidence for an agn",
    ", we find active nuclei in 13% of the drgs with spectroscopic redshifts . under the assumption that all drgs without redshift identification lack emission lines in their spectra , the estimated ( unobscured ) agn fraction among the observed drgs could be as low as @xmath53 . for comparison ,",
    "4 out of 28 ( 14% ) of our spectroscopically observed drgs in the cdfs have a x - ray detection in the 1ms chandra exposure on that field ( giacconi et al .",
    "the x - ray detected fraction among all drgs with @xmath5 in the cdfs amounts to 9% .",

    "the closely hatched bar at @xmath54 marks the region in redshift space where spectroscopic confirmation with lris is complicated because for galaxies at these redshifts [ oii]3727 lies redward of the covered wavelength range while  has not entered the blue sensitive region of the detector yet . since optical spectroscopic surveys of faint galaxies often rely on these relatively bright emission lines as sole redshift indicators , we caution that our spectroscopically confirmed sample may be biased against galaxies in this redshift range , even if they have significant [ oii ] or  line emission .",

    "the suggested @xmath7-band dependence of the success rate to identify redshifts ( see  [ successbias.sec ] ) is thus not trivially related to a redshift dependence of the success rate .",
    "we caution that biases against galaxies without emission lines , and galaxies in the no man s land of optical spectroscopy indicated with the hatched bars in fig .",
    "[ speczhist.fig ] might affect the presented redshift distribution .",
    "therefore , we return to the questions raised at the start of this section in  [ lowvshighzdrg.sec ] , using photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for a complete drg sample .",
    "in order to better address the observed and intrinsic properties , and fraction of low - redshift ( @xmath2 ) drgs , we complement the spectroscopic sample presented above with photometric redshift estimates for the remaining drgs in the hdfs , 054 , and the cdfs .",
    "although photometric redshifts have been tested for optically - bright galaxies ( wuyts et al .",
    "2008 ; brammer et al .",
    "2008 ) , the number of drgs with redshifts in these fields has been very limited .",
    "the reliance on photometric redshifts has been one of the main uncertainties in , e.g. , the results on the mass assembly over cosmic time ( marchesini et al . 2009 ) . in this section ,",
    "we assess the reliability of published photometric redshifts for these fields , focussing primarily on drgs .",
    "we first summarize the method and templates used to estimate redshifts from broad - band photometry .",
    "next , we analyse the quality of the photometric redshifts by comparison to the available spectroscopic redshifts .      using the publicly available code eazy ( brammer et al .",
    "2008 ) , photometric redshifts were derived for all @xmath7-band selected sources in the hdfs , 054 , and the cdfs .",
    "briefly , the program fits a non - negative linear combination of synthetic templates to the @xmath70-to-8 @xmath20 m broad - band photometry . using the @xmath7-band magnitude as a prior , and applying a template error function that downweights the rest - frame uv and rest - frame nir of the templates in the fit , one obtains a redshift probability distribution .",
    "we adopt as best estimate the value of the redshift marginalized over this probability distribution ( see eq . 5 in brammer et al .",

    "we quantify the performance of the photometric redshift code eazy by brammer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) by a direct comparison with the available spectroscopic redshifts ( see figure[photz_specz.fig ] ) .",
    "drgs are marked in black , with large symbols representing objects targeted by our spectroscopic survey .",
    "galaxies with @xmath71 are plotted in grey .",
    "their spectroscopic redshifts are compiled from the literature on the 3 fields , carefully cross - correlating galaxies from the spectroscopic surveys to objects in the @xmath7-band selected catalogs and conservatively limiting ourselves to those sources with highest quality @xmath72 .",
    "the non - drgs for which we measured redshifts during our survey ( table[nondrg.tab ] ) are also plotted in grey .",
    "ideally , one algorithm and set of templates provides simultaneously accurate redshift estimates for galaxies of different types and at a range of cosmological distances . here , we focus on the @xmath73 quality of drgs , but place it in context by comparing the distribution of @xmath74 for drgs to that of the whole population of galaxies and the subsample at @xmath6 .    the results are quantified with 3 statistical measures in table[photozqual.tab ] : the median of @xmath3 quantifies systematic offsets , the normalized median absolute deviation @xmath75 ( equal to the rms for a gaussian distribution ) is a measure of scatter robust against outliers .",
    "third , we list the fraction of catastrophic outliers ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we find a tight correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath72 for the drgs , without any systematic offset , and characterised by a @xmath77 , depending on the precise sample definition .",
    "there are no catastrophic outliers among the drgs .",
    "it is reassuring that , despite the lack of agn templates , the template set performs equally well for those drgs with an x - ray detection as for the others .",
    "this might mean that the optical - to - nir seds of these drgs with an x - ray detection is dominated by stellar light , and that the agn is obscured .    considering all 1517 galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift , 83% ( 90% ) of which lie below @xmath78",
    ", we again find a small scatter ( @xmath79 ) and no systematic offsets .",
    "the fraction of catastrophic outliers is small , 3% of all galaxies has @xmath80 .",
    "a third of these have a value of the quality parameter @xmath81 ( see brammer et al .",
    "2008 ) , whereas less than 2% of the sources with @xmath82 was flagged with @xmath81 .",
    "the quality of photometric redshifts remains high , even for the subsample of galaxies at @xmath6 , where @xmath83 .",
    "we conclude that a similar high quality of photometric redshifts is reached for the spectroscopically confirmed drgs as for the total galaxy sample with spectroscopy .",
    "however , as noted earlier , the subsample of drgs with spectroscopic confirmation is biased toward sources with emission lines .",
    "nir multi - object spectrographs that will come on - line soon will be able to establish the @xmath73 accuracy for the drg sample as a whole in a time - efficient manner , targeting either rest - frame optical emission lines ( e.g. , kriek et al .",
    "2007 ) or balmer/4000   breaks in the continuum ( kriek et al .",
    "having established confidence in the @xmath73 estimates for drgs , we can now revisit the questions raised in  [ zdistribution.sec ]",
    "( what is the typical redshift and redshift range of galaxies selected as drgs , and how efficient is the criterion at selecting @xmath84 galaxies ) , and in addition address how the low - redshift drgs stand out with respect to their high - redshift counterparts . to this purpose , we plot the @xmath13 color of all galaxies with @xmath5 in the considered fields versus @xmath73 ( _ empty symbols _ ) , or @xmath72 ( _ filled symbols _ ) when available ( figure  [ jkvsz.fig ] ) .",
    "the median redshift of drgs in this combined spectroscopic and photometric sample is @xmath85 , with the central 68% of drgs located in the redshift interval @xmath86 .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath14 criterion in selecting galaxies above @xmath56 is found to be 74% .",
    "the efficiency progressively increases with redder @xmath13 color .",
    "only 11% ( 2.6% ) of the galaxies with @xmath87 2.6 ( 2.9 ) was assigned a redshift below @xmath56 .",
    "less than half of the drgs at @xmath2 have a @xmath13 color that is consistent at the @xmath88 level with being photometrically scattered into the drg selection window , making it unlikely that all of the low - redshift interlopers are due to photometric uncertainties .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ jkvsz.fig ] that the high efficiency of the drg criterion to select @xmath6 galaxies does not mean that all of the @xmath7-selected galaxies at @xmath6 have such red @xmath13 colors . the fraction of @xmath6 galaxies that are drgs increases with stellar mass ( wuyts et al .",
    "2007 ) and reaches 69% at masses above @xmath89 ( van dokkum et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we now proceed to examine the nature of drgs at @xmath2 .",
    "first , we consider the observed @xmath7-band magnitude of drgs as a function of redshift ( figure  [ kvsz.fig ] ) . apart from the spectroscopically confirmed redshifts from our ( _ large filled circles _ ) and other ( _ small filled circles _ ) surveys , we plot the other drgs ( _ empty circles _ ) in the considered fields using their photometric redshift estimates .",
    "both the spectroscopic and the photometric sample of drgs show a correlation between @xmath7-band magnitude and redshift . in our sample to @xmath90 , we find a median @xmath91 for @xmath2 drgs , compared to a median @xmath92 for @xmath6 drgs .",
    "consequently , the fraction of low - redshift ( @xmath2 ) drgs increases toward brighter @xmath7-band magnitudes , consistent with quadri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in order to investigate the difference in intrinsic properties between low- and high - redshift drgs",
    ", we plot their rest - frame seds , normalized to the rest - frame @xmath93-band flux , in figure  [ restsed.fig ] . although satisfying the same observed color criterion ( @xmath32 ) , the populations at low- and high redshift show markedly different rest - frame sed shapes .",
    "the low - redshift drgs show low flux levels in the uv and a positive slope of the sed at the rest - frame @xmath93-band .",
    "the high - redshift drgs instead show a wide range in rest - frame uv slopes and have seds with a declining slope at the rest - frame @xmath93-band ( see also frster schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "an interpretation of the difference in rest - frame sed shapes is provided by modeling of the optical - to - mir seds using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis code following the procedure described by wuyts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , keeping the redshift fixed to the @xmath73 , or @xmath72 when available . a maximal visual extinction of @xmath94 magnitudes was allowed during the fit , adopting a calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attenuation law .",
    "wuyts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) demonstrated that the inclusion of irac photometry ( available for all drgs in our sample ) helps to break the age - dust degeneracy and to constrain the amount of extinction in red galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "the estimated extinction is plotted versus redshift in figure  [ avvsz.fig ] .",
    "although drgs at @xmath6 with several magnitudes of extinction in the v - band do exist , a trend of @xmath8 with redshift is significant at the 99.9% level , both for the total sample and the subsample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the median dust extinction of @xmath2 drgs is @xmath95 , compared to a median value of @xmath96 for the @xmath6 drgs to the same @xmath25 limit .",
    "the imposed k - band limit is at least partly responsible for the paucity of drgs with @xmath97 at @xmath98 in our sample .",
    "we tested this by taking the best - fit templates for the most obscured ( @xmath97 ) drgs at @xmath99 , and computing the observed @xmath7-band magnitude and @xmath13 color when redshifting the templates out to @xmath100 ( 3.5 ) .",
    "the redshifted dusty galaxies still satisfy the drg criterion , but at @xmath101 ( 3.5 ) they drop out of our @xmath7-limited sample in 64% ( 85% ) of the cases .",
    "the lack of low - redshift drgs with small amounts of extinction is real , and not influenced by such a selection effect .",
    "we note that more than 82% of the drgs at @xmath2 would also be picked up by the @xmath102 selection criterion for extremely red objects ( eros , mccarthy et al .",
    "this fraction drops to about 58% for the drgs at higher redshifts . based on keck spectroscopy of @xmath102 selected eros , doherty et al .",
    "( 2005 ) inferred a dominant old stellar population for 75% of the ero sample , being responsible for their red color . based on our sed modeling",
    "we conclude that , with the additional constraint of @xmath14 , one preferentially selects those eros whose large dust content is responsible for the red slope of the sed over a large wavelength range .",
    "in this paper , we presented optical spectroscopic follow - up for a sample of distant red galaxies with @xmath5 in the fields hdfs , 054 , and cdfs",
    ". redshifts were identified for a total of 15 out of 64 of the observed drgs .",
    "an additional 30 drgs , though not necessarily representative for that population , are spectroscopically confirmed by other surveys in the cdfs .",
    "in addition , we release spectroscopic redshifts of 49 non - drgs ( half of which at @xmath6 ) , selected from the same fields .    using 8 - 10 m class telescopes under varying seeing conditions , we obtain a modest success rate of 22% only for the drgs , increasing toward brighter @xmath27 and especially @xmath41 magnitude .",
    "emission line spectra are more easily identified , meaning that the spectroscopic sample is biased toward those sources with at least some unobscured radiating gas present .",
    "apart from , interstellar absorption lines are detected in one and emission lines typical for agn activity in two of the high - redshift drgs . with only 2 objects at @xmath2 in the purely @xmath13 selected sample ,",
    "we confirm that the drg criterion @xmath14 is an efficient means to isolate galaxies at @xmath6 , with the redshift distribution of the purely @xmath13-selected spectroscopically confirmed sample peaking around @xmath103 .",
    "we use the total sample of 45 spectroscopically confirmed drgs to address the quality of the eazy photometric redshift code developed by brammer et al .",
    "the scatter in @xmath3 is small ( @xmath104 ) , and the comparison shows no systematic offsets .",
    "this is true , irrespective of whether we restrict the sample to drgs at @xmath6 or not .",
    "the drgs have a similar @xmath73 quality as what is measured for all 1517 galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation in the considered deep fields , and as the subsample of 145 galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "including drgs with photometric redshifts , we find that the median of the drg redshift distribution is @xmath105 , and the efficiency of the drg criterion to select galaxies at @xmath6 is 74% for our sample to @xmath5 .",
    "drgs at redshifts below @xmath56 are significantly more extincted by dust than those at higher redshifts . in observed properties ,",
    "they are generally characterized by having brighter @xmath41 magnitudes ( 0.7 mag brighter in the median than @xmath6 drgs to the same @xmath25 limit ) , and @xmath13 colors close to @xmath106 .",
    "sed modeling implies a median dust extinction for @xmath2 drgs that is as high as @xmath95 .",
    "we conclude that the drg criterion selects preferentially galaxies at @xmath6 , but also picks up lower redshift sources that are characterized by different sed shapes and typically brighter @xmath7-band magnitudes .",
    "such biases can be avoided by selecting galaxies based on their rest - frame properties .",
    "such a rest - frame selection requires very good multi - wavelength photometry and accurate photometric redshifts .",
