    "compressed sensing is a new paradigm of data acquisition that takes advantage of this property to reduce the amount of data that needs to be acquired to recover the signal of interest . unlike the conventional paradigm , in which large quantities of data are acquired , often followed by compression , compressed sensing acquires minimally redundant data directly in a universal way that does not depend on the data @xcite .    the model for the acquisition",
    "is formally stated as the following linear system : let @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) be the unknown signal .",
    "the measurement vector @xmath3 obtained by sensing matrix @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes additive noise . in the conventional paradigm , arbitrary signal @xmath0 is stably reconstructed when the rows of @xmath7 constitute a frame for @xmath8 , which requires redundant measurements ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in contrast , compressed sensing aims to reconstruct signals that are ( approximately ) @xmath10-sparse over a dictionary @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) from compressive measurements ( @xmath12 ) . let @xmath13 be the coefficient vector of @xmath14 over @xmath15 such that @xmath16 with @xmath17 being @xmath10-sparse .",
    "is assumed arbitrary , the model error term @xmath18 can be absorbed into @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath17 can be assumed approximately sparse .",
    "we consider the former case in this paper . ]",
    "then , the composition @xmath20 can be viewed as a sensing matrix for @xmath17 that produces the measurement vector @xmath21 .",
    "once an estimate @xmath22 of @xmath17 is computed , @xmath23 provides an estimate of the unknown signal @xmath14 .",
    "hence , we may focus on the recovery of sparse @xmath17 .    in an ideal case with exact sparse signal model and noise - free measurements ,",
    "if any @xmath24 columns of @xmath25 are linearly independent , the unknown @xmath10-sparse @xmath17 is recovered as the unique solution to the linear system @xmath26 @xcite . in typical examples of compressed sensing ( e.g. , @xmath25 is a matrix with independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian entries ) , this is often achieved with @xmath27 . however",
    ", this algebraic guarantee only shows the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "furthermore , it is only valid in the absence of measurement noise and no error in the sparse signal model .    in practice , both computational cost of signal recovery , and its robustness against noise and model error are of interest . for certain matrices",
    "@xmath25 , the unknown @xmath17 is stably recovered using efficient algorithms from compressive measurements . the required number of measurements for a stable recovery is quantified through a property of @xmath25 called the _ restricted isometry property _ ( rip ) @xcite .",
    "the _ @xmath10-restricted isometry constant _",
    "@xmath28 of @xmath25 is defined as the smallest @xmath29 that satisfies @xmath30    matrix @xmath25 satisfies the rip of order @xmath10 if @xmath31 for some constant @xmath32 .",
    "intuitively , smaller @xmath28 implies that @xmath33 is closer to @xmath17 for all @xmath10-sparse @xmath17 .",
    "although , in general , the recovery of @xmath10-sparse @xmath17 from compressive measurements is np hard even in the noiseless case , the recovery can be accomplished efficiently ( in polynomial time ) and with guaranteed accuracy , when @xmath25 satisfies the rip with certain parameters ( order and threshold ) .",
    "such results are among the major achievements of compressed sensing theory .",
    "for example , when @xmath34 , the solution to an @xmath35-norm - based convex optimization formulation provides a good approximation of the unknown @xmath10-sparse @xmath17 @xcite . the approximation error in this result is guaranteed to be small , and vanishes in the noiseless case . a computationally efficient alternative is provided by iterative greedy algorithms @xcite , which exploit the rip of @xmath25 to compute an approximation of @xmath17 .",
    "these iterative greedy algorithms provide similar approximation guarantees when @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath32 are constants specified by the algorithms .",
    "different applications of the rip require different values for the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "henceforth , we assume that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitrarily fixed constants as above .",
    "the question of feasibility of compressed sensing then reduces to determining whether , and with how many measurements , @xmath25 satisfies the rip . certain random matrices",
    "@xmath40 satisfy @xmath41 with high probability when the number of measurements @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 for some small integer @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this result , when combined with the aforementioned rip - based guarantees of the recovery algorithms , enables `` compressive sensing '' ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 satisfies the _ strong concentration property _",
    ", that is , @xmath45 is highly concentrated around its expectation for all @xmath17 , then @xmath41 holds with @xmath46 @xcite . in words",
    ", a number @xmath42 of measurements that is proportional to the number @xmath10 of nonzeros , and only logarithmic in the number @xmath47 of unknowns , suffices for stable and computationally efficient recovery .",
    "this celebrated result of compressed sensing has been extended to the case where @xmath7 satisfies the strong concentration property with @xmath48 and @xmath15 satisfies the rip , stating that @xmath49 holds with @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "now , the rip of @xmath15 is often relatively easy to satisfy .",
    "recall that the role of @xmath15 is to provide a sparse representation of @xmath14 .",
    "although redundant @xmath15 ( with @xmath50 ) performs better in this respect , it is often the case that @xmath14 is sparse over a @xmath15 that is a basis ( e.g. , a piecewise smooth signal @xmath14 over a wavelet basis @xmath15 ) . in this case , @xmath51 is easily bounded using the condition number of @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath15 is an orthonormal basis , then @xmath52 for any @xmath53 . as for the strong concentration property of @xmath7 , it is satisfied by an i.i.d .",
    "gaussian or bernoulli matrix @xcite .",
    "this has been extended recently to any matrix satisfying the rip with certain parameters , when postmultiplied by a random diagonal matrix of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "when implementing such a sensing system is technically feasible , it would provide a sensing matrix @xmath7 that admits efficient computation @xcite .",
    "however , although the aforementioned random matrix models are interesting in theory , they are rarely used in practice . in most practical signal acquisition systems ,",
    "the linear functionals used for acquiring the measurements ( rows of @xmath7 ) are determined by the physics of the specific modality and by design constraints of the sensor . in compressed sensing applied to these systems",
    "@xcite , the sensing matrix @xmath7 does not follow the aforementioned random matrix models ; instead its rows are i.i.d .",
    "samples from the uniform distribution on a set that constitutes a frame in @xmath8 . as an additional row does not increase the ric of @xmath7 .",
    "a similar construction of @xmath7 , where the rows are selected from a frame using the bernoulli sampling , has also been studied @xcite .",
    "while the bernoulli sampling does not cause the repetition , the size of selection is no longer deterministic , i.e. , it is concentrated around @xmath42 with high probability .",
    "the imperfection with these two sampling schemes becomes negligible as the size of @xmath7 increases .",
    "we focus on the i.i.d .",
    "sampling scheme in this paper . ]    to describe the sensing matrix more precisely , we recall the definition of a frame @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the hilbert space of functions defined on a compact set @xmath56 that are square integrable with respect to a probability measure @xmath57 on @xmath56 , and by @xmath58 the @xmath59-dimensional euclidean space .",

    "random frame matrices arise in numerous applications of compressed sensing .",
    "we list a few below .",

    ", an @xmath81 random partial dft matrix is constructed from @xmath61 using @xmath57 by ( [ eq : contra ] ) .",
    "the frame @xmath61 in this example is a tight frame , and @xmath82 , which will play a role in our subsequent discussion , achieves its minimum @xmath83 . sensing matrix of this kind arise in practical applications of compressed sensing such as the multi - coset sampling and spectrum - blind recovery of multiband signals at sub - nyquist rates @xcite .",
    "similar random matrices also arise in more recent studies on compressed sensing of analog signals @xcite .",
    "[ example : dft ]    one author of this paper proposed the compressive acquisition of signals in fourier imaging systems @xcite , which is one of the works that invented the notion of compressed sensing . this idea has been applied with refinements to various modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite , photo - acoustic tomography @xcite , radar @xcite , radar imaging @xcite , and astronomical imaging @xcite , etc .",
    "the sensing matrix @xmath7 for compressed sensing in fourier imaging systems is a random partial fourier transform matrix with continuous - valued frequencies ( _ continuous random partial fourier matrix _ , henceforth ) , which is obtained similarly to the previous example .",
    "let @xmath76^t$ ] be defined for @xmath84 .",
    "the frame @xmath61 in this example is a continuous tight frame , and the quantity @xmath82 achieves its minimum @xmath83 .",
    "[ example : cft ]    in mri , the fourier measurements are usually modeled as obtained from the input signal modified by pointwise multiplication with a mask @xmath85 , representing the receiving coil sensitivity profile .",
    "let @xmath86 denote the diagonal matrix with the elements of @xmath87 on the diagonal .",
    "let @xmath88^t$ ] be defined for @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath87 has no zero element , then @xmath61 is a frame that spans @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath61 is a frame for the subspace @xmath89 of @xmath8 spanned by the standard basis vectors corresponding to the nonzero elements of @xmath87 . in the latter case , letting the signal space be @xmath89 instead of @xmath8 , we modify the inverse problem so that @xmath7 constructed by ( [ eq : contra ] ) is a map from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . note that each vector in the frame is multiplied from the right by @xmath91 compared to that in example  [ example : cft ] . in this example , unless the nonzero elements of @xmath87 have the same magnitudes , @xmath61 does not satisfy the two properties coming from a fourier system ( tightness and minimal @xmath82 ) . therefore , we do not restrict our interest to the fourier case and consider a general frame @xmath61 .",
    "[ example : cft2 ]    because random frame matrices are so ubiquitous in compressed sensing , the analysis of their rip is of major interest .",
    "although random frame matrices do not satisfy the strong concentration property , other tools are available for the analysis of their rip .",
    "in particular , the rip of a partial fourier matrix has been studied using noncommutative probability theory @xcite .",
    "the extension of this analysis to the rip of a random frame matrix @xcite enables handling a more general class of sensing matrices .",
    "notably , all known analyses @xcite focused on the case where @xmath15 corresponds to an orthonormal basis .",
    "these analyses also assumed either the exact isotropy property , @xmath92 @xcite , or the so - called near isotropy property , @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "there is no alternative sufficient condition that does not require these properties .",
    "in fact though , these rip analyses further extend to the following theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] ( proved in section  [ sec : rbp ] ) , which addresses the case of @xmath20 , where @xmath7 is a random frame matrix and @xmath15 is not necessarily an orthonormal basis , and furthermore , allows a non - vanishing deviation from isotropy .    let @xmath4 be a random matrix constructed from a frame @xmath61 by ( [ eq : contra ] ) and let @xmath94 \\in \\mathbb{k}^{d \\times n}$ ] satisfy @xmath95 .",

    "then , @xmath97 holds with high probability for @xmath98 .",
    "[ thm : uripsimple ]    the inequality in theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] indicates that @xmath36 holds with high probability for @xmath99 if @xmath15 satisfies @xmath100 , and @xmath7 satisfies @xmath101 .",
    "combined with the aforementioned rip - based guarantees , this result again enables compressive sensing , when the conditions given in theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] are satisfied .",
    "while the rip is essential for all existing performance guarantees for compressed sensing with random frame sensing matrices , it turns out that this property is satisfied only under certain nonrealistic assumptions .",
    "most notably , although compressed sensing has been proposed to accelerate the acquisition in imaging systems @xcite and some of the most widely studied applications of compressed sensing to date are in such systems , the rip has not been shown to hold for the associated sensing matrices in a realistic setup . more specifically , @xmath102 is not negligible , which makes even the upper bound on @xmath28 given by theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] , which is the most relaxed condition on deviation from isotropy known to date , too conservative to be used for rip - based recovery guarantees .",
    "one reason for the increase @xmath102 from the ideal case is the use of a nonuniform distribution in the construction of @xmath7 . in examples  [ example : dft ] and [ example : cft ] ,",
    "the sensing matrix @xmath7 were constructed from i.i.d .",
    "samples from a tight frame @xmath61 . in this case , if the i.i.d .",
    "sampling is done in accordance to the uniform distribution , then @xmath92 .",
    "however , in practice , i.i.d . sampling using a nonuniform distribution is often preferred for natural signals : it is desirable to take more measurements of lower frequency components , which contain more of the signal energy . therefore , acquisition at frequencies sampled non - uniformly with a variable density is preferred @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the exact isotropy property is violated .",
    "depending on the probability distribution , @xmath102 is often not negligible , and even larger than 1 , which renders the upper bound on @xmath28 in theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] useless .",
    "therefore , no known rip analysis applies to fourier imaging applications .",
    "another reason for the increase @xmath102 from the ideal case is that @xmath61 is a not tight frame .",
    "as shown in example  [ example : cft2 ] , even in a fourier imaging system , @xmath61 can be a non - tight frame due to the presence of a mask .",
    "furthermore , the application of compressed sensing is not restricted to fourier imaging systems .",
    "the idea of compressed sensing and recovery using sparsity also applies to other inverse problems in imaging described by non - orthogonal operators ( e.g. , a fredholm integral equations of the first kind ) .",
    "optical diffusion tomography @xcite is a concrete example of compressed sensing with such a scenario . as another example ,",
    "the sensing matrix that arises in compressed sensing in shift - invariant spaces @xcite is not necessarily obtained from a tight frame .",
    "yet another reason for the failure of the upper bound on @xmath28 in theorem  [ thm : uripsimple ] has to do with the dictionary @xmath15 . indeed , to achieve @xmath31 with @xmath99 , it is necessary that both @xmath102 and @xmath51 are less than a certain threshold .",
    "however , verification of this condition for @xmath51 is usually computationally expensive .",
    "for the special case where @xmath15 has full column rank ( hence , @xmath103 ) , @xmath51 is easily bounded from above by @xmath104 . in particular , if @xmath15 corresponds to an orthonormal basis , then @xmath105 , which implies @xmath106 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath51 vanishes as @xmath15 approaches an orthonormal basis .",
    "however , it is often too restrictive to make @xmath104 less than a small threshold below 1 .",
    "moreover , without this constraint , @xmath15 can provide a better sparse representation , which is also desired for stable recovery .",
    "in particular , for a data - adaptive @xmath15 , the property that @xmath104 is less than a given threshold is not guaranteed . in this all too common situation ,",
    "all known rip analyses break down : they only provide a conservative upper bound on @xmath28 , which does enable the rip - based recovery - guarantees .    in summary , in most practical compressed sensing applications ,",
    "the effective sensing matrix @xmath20 may fail to satisfy the rip for one or more of the following reasons : the i.i.d .",
    "sampling in the construction of @xmath7 does not use the uniform distribution ; the frame used in the construction of @xmath7 is not tight ; or the dictionary @xmath15 does not have a sufficiently small restricted isometry constant . from these observations , we conclude that none of the existing performance guarantees for recovery algorithms applies to the aforementioned applications of compressed sensing .",
    "recall that unlike the @xmath35-norm - based recovery , greedy recovery algorithms were designed to exploit the property that @xmath107 for sparse @xmath17 , explicitly .",
    "for example , in the derivation of the cosamp algorithm @xcite , the procedure of applying @xmath108 to @xmath109 for @xmath17 sparse was called the computation of a `` proxy '' signal , which reveals the information about the locations of nonzero elements of @xmath17 .",
    "the same idea was also used for deriving other iterative greedy algorithms @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath25 satisfies the rip , then the use of the ( transpose of ) the same matrix @xmath25 to compute a proxy is a promising approach .",
    "otherwise , one can employ a different matrix @xmath110 to get a better proxy @xmath111 .",
    "the required property is that @xmath112 for sparse @xmath17 . to improve the recovery algorithms in this direction ,",
    "we first extend the rip to a property of a pair of matrices @xmath113 called the _ restricted biorthogonality property _ ( rbop ) .    the _ @xmath10-restricted biorthogonality constant _ @xmath114 of @xmath115",
    "is defined as the smallest @xmath29 that satisfies @xmath116    the pair @xmath117 satisfies the rbop of order @xmath10 if @xmath118 for some constant @xmath32 . for which the rbop is said to be satisfied depends on the application . ]",
    "intuitively , smaller @xmath119 implies that @xmath120 becomes closer to @xmath17 for all @xmath10-sparse @xmath17 .",
    "in other words , any @xmath10 columns of @xmath25 and @xmath110 corresponding to the same indices behave like a biorthogonal basis . if @xmath121 , then @xmath119 reduces to @xmath28 ; hence , the rbop of @xmath117 reduces to the rip of @xmath25 .",
    "we then modify the greedy recovery algorithms so that the modified algorithms employ both @xmath25 and @xmath110 and , in particular , exploit the rbop of @xmath117 to provide an approximation guarantee .",
    "in fact , modified thresholding and forward greedy algorithms using a different matrix @xmath110 have been already proposed by schnass and vandergheynst @xcite . however , our work is different from theirs in several important respects .",
    "schnass and vandergheynst @xcite propose to use @xmath110 numerically optimized to minimize a version of the babel function .",
    "however , although sufficient conditions given in terms of the babel function are easily computable , the resulting guarantees for the recovery performance are conservative .",
    "furthermore , their numerical algorithm to design @xmath110 is a heuristic , and does not provide any guarantee on the value of the babel function achieved .",
    "in contrast , we propose an explicit construction of @xmath110 so that @xmath122 holds . to show the construction , we recall the definition of a biorthogonal frame that extends the notion of a biorthogonal basis .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath123 be sets of vectors in @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath124 be as defined in definition  [ def : frame ] .",
    "let @xmath64 be the analysis operator associated to @xmath61 defined in ( [ eq : defanalysis ] ) .",
    "let @xmath125 be the synthesis operator associated to @xmath123 defined similarly to ( [ eq : defsynthesis ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath126 is a _ biorthogonal frame _ if @xmath127 .",
    "matrix @xmath110 is then constructed as the composition @xmath128 .",
    "we construct @xmath129 from the dual frame @xmath130 by @xmath131^{-1 } \\overline{(\\widetilde{\\phi}_{\\omega_k})_\\ell } , \\quad \\forall k \\in [ m],~ \\ell \\in [ d ] \\label{eq : contrtildea}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are the same indices as used to define the samples from @xmath132 in the construction of @xmath7 in ( [ eq : contra ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath133 , then , by the construction of @xmath7 and @xmath134 , it follows that the pair @xmath135 satisfies the dual isotropy property @xmath136    we proposed modified greedy pursuit algorithms in section  [ sec : algorithms ] that use both @xmath20 and @xmath128 and are guaranteed using the rbop of @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , it is important to check whether @xmath137 can be efficiently implemented .",
    "the discussion on @xmath138 is deferred to the next subsections and we only discuss the computational issue with @xmath134 here . in practice , @xmath139 is implemented using fast algorithms without forming a dense matrix explicitly .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is a partial dft matrix , then , @xmath139 is implemented as the fast fourier transform ( fft ) applied to the zero padded vector . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath7 is a continuous partial fourier matrix , then , the nonuniform fft ( nufft ) @xcite can be used for fast computation . in this case , since our construction of @xmath134 in ( [ eq : contrtildea ] ) only involves row - wise rescaling of @xmath7 by constant factors , @xmath140 is also implemented using the same fast algorithms . in the more general biorthogonal case ,",
    "once the synthesis operator @xmath134 is implemented as a fast algorithm , @xmath140 is also computed efficiently using the same algorithm . in fact , in many applications , the biorthogonal dual system is given analytically .",
    "for example , if the frame @xmath61 is given as a filter bank system , designing perfect reconstruction filters that provide the corresponding biorthogonal dual frame is well studied @xcite .",
    "similar arguments apply to the analysis operator of analytic frames such as overcomplete dct or wavelet packets .",
    "regarding the construction of @xmath141 , we consider the following two cases : ( i ) @xmath15 corresponds to a basis for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath15 satisfies the rip with certain parameter .",
    "we let @xmath144 for the former case and @xmath145 for the latter case .",
    "the rbop of this construction is deferred to after the exposition of new recovery algorithms .",
    "now , we return to the discussion of the recovery algorithms . while schnass and vandergheynst @xcite only replaced @xmath25 by @xmath110 in the steps of computing a proxy in forward greedy algorithms ( mp and omp ) , we also replace the orthogonal projection used in the update of the residual in omp by a corresponding oblique projection obtained from @xmath25 and @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we propose a different variation of omp called oblique matching pursuit ( obmp ) , which is guaranteed using the rbop of @xmath117 .",
    "we also propose similar modifications of iterative greedy recovery algorithms and their rip - based guarantees .",
    "the modified algorithms are different from the original algorithms : we assign them new names , with the modifier `` oblique '' .",
    "for example , sp is extended to _",
    "oblique subspace pursuit _ ( obsp ) .",
    "cosamp , iht , and htp are likewise extended to obcosamp , obiht , obhtp , respectively .",
    "we call these modified greedy algorithms based on the rbop _ oblique pursuits_. in the numerical experiments in this paper , in scenarios where one or more of the ideal assumptions ( i.i.d . sampling according to the uniform distribution , tight frame @xmath61 , or orthonormal basis @xmath15 ) are violated , the oblique pursuits perform better than , or at least competitively with their conventional counterparts .",
    "importantly , the oblique pursuits come with rbop - based approximation guarantees . in particular , similarly to its conventional counterpart , each iterative oblique pursuit algorithm is guaranteed when @xmath146 , where @xmath37 and @xmath32 are constants specified by the algorithms .",
    "the number of measurements required for the guarantees of oblique pursuits is also similar to that required in the ideal scenario by their conventional counterparts .",
    "when combined with the subsequent rbop analysis of @xmath117 for random frame sensing matrices , the recovery by the iterative oblique pursuit algorithms is guaranteed with @xmath99 .",
