    "the accumulation of dopant charges in mott insulators and the dependence of the critical doping level on the relative strength of the coulomb repulsion have been studied for a large variety of correlated electron systems.@xcite generally , with increasing @xmath6 ratio ( where @xmath7 is the on - site coulomb interaction and @xmath8 the effective one - electron bandwidth ) the insulating phase becomes more robust against doping - induced insulator to metal transition .    in perovskite - type manganites , due to the strong interplay between electronic charge , spin ,",
    "orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom , at specific carrier concentrations ( so - called commensurate doping levels ) several charge and orbital ordered ( co / oo ) patterns emerge accompanied by antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite these co / oo states are inherently insulators and in their vicinity charge and orbital correlation effects are critically intensified .",
    "consequently , for the compounds with relatively narrow one - electron bandwidth the co / oo ground state remains stable against considerable variation of doping and hence the metallic conduction does not appear.@xcite however , at a fixed carrier concentration , as the bandwidth of the @xmath9 electrons is increased , the co / oo suddenly collapses and the compound goes through a first order insulator to metal transition and simultaneously an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition.@xcite this tendency is discerned in fig .",
    "1(a ) in the bandwidth - temperature phase diagram typical of re@xmath10ae@xmath11mno@xmath2 materials close to half doping , namely for @xmath12 in the present case .",
    "throughout the paper we shall refer the averaged radius of re@xmath10ae@xmath11 as a measure of the @xmath9 one - electron bandwidth , in the sense that it reflects the magnitude of the double exchange interaction responsible for the ferromagnetic metallic phase ( fm).@xcite the competition of spin - orbital exchange interaction energies , further balanced by strong coupling to the lattice , is clearly manifested in the first - order nature of the transition between the two robust phases with ordering temperatures ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) higher than @xmath15k . the first - order transition line separating the two ordered phases is terminated by a bicritical point at as high temperature as @xmath16k , indicating the stability of the both phases against thermal fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the application of magnetic fields of a few tesla efficiently induce the co / oo afi to fm transition implying the precise balance of the free energy for the two neighboring ground states.@xcite these result in gigantic phase fluctuations above the bicritical point and cause that the onset of the ordered phase with decreasing temperature also occurs in a first - order - transition manner on either side of the bicritical point.@xcite among macroscopic quantities , colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) is the most dramatic manifestation of this phase - fluctuation induced phenomenon.@xcite     and @xmath17 meet at @xmath18k and form the so - called bicritical point , while in the latter the ordered phases are suppressed and an intermediate spin glass phase appears below @xmath19 due to the quenched disorder .",
    "the compounds investigated in the present optical study are highlighted in the lower panel.,width=249 ]    in perovskite - type manganites the carriers are doped via the partial substitution of the rare earth component ( re ) with divalent ions in the form of re@xmath10ae@xmath11mno@xmath2 where usually ae@xmath20ca , sr , and ba .",
    "in addition to the change of the band filling , this random doping introduces quenched disorder into the lattice which can result in a critical suppression of the long range order on the both sides of the bicritical point ( fig .",
    "the variance of the ionic radius at the perovskite @xmath21 site was found to well represent the degree of disorder.@xcite for the compounds in fig .",
    "1(a ) the variance is rather low while it is considerably large for those in fig .",
    "1(b ) and therefore they will be referred to as low- and high - disorder phase diagram , respectively .",
    "the long - range co / oo afi state is primarily sensitive to the local lattice distortion and looses territory towards larger variance .",
    "the broad intermediate region bounded by the two ordered phases in fig .",
    "1(b ) is characterized by short - range co / oo correlation enhanced toward low temperatures and finally frozen to an insulating glassy state below @xmath19 .",
    "the weakening of the ferromagnetism or the critical suppression of @xmath14 close to the bicritical point is probably the result of co /",
    "oo fluctuations , as well .",
    "this was indeed observed in recent x - ray diffuse scattering and raman scattering experiments : similarly to the temperature region above @xmath13 and @xmath19,@xcite for larger bandwidth the co / oo correlation is also critically enhanced toward low temperatures where it was suddenly cut by the first - order fm transition.@xcite therefore , it seems very plausible to consider that the paramagnetic region above all the ground - state phases is essentially governed by strong short - range correlation of the co / oo phase in addition to fm spin fluctuations .    in an effort to understand the details of the cmr effect for nearly half - doped perovskite manganites with high quenched disorder  beyond the basic picture capturing the role of competing magnetic exchange interactions and interlocking of spin , charge , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom @xcite  several intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "the formers treat cmr as a result of strong fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum phase,@xcite while the latters consider disoder - induced phase separation and percolation effects indispensable for the description of the phenomenon.@xcite recently , the existence of topological defects in the orbital order , namely orbital solitons carrying @xmath22 charge , for manganites close to half doping were also suggested as a natural explanation of nanoscale inhomogeneities in these materials.@xcite    ae@xmath1mno@xmath2 cmr manganites .",

    "here we turn to the analysis of the temperature - induced spectral - weight transfer both for the insulating and metallic compounds . while the charge gap in the co / oo state of gcmo and gcsmo shows only a weak temperature dependence up to @xmath13 , the loss of the long - range order results in a sudden decrease of the gap energy as shown in fig .",

    "the closing of the gap occurs in a smooth way .",
    "although in either of the three insulators the metallic conductivity is not fully recovered at any temperatures , the development of an incoherent contribution to the optical conductivity implies the partial liberation of the orbital degrees of freedom in the @xmath9 sector .",
    "more specifically , the reduced gap in the glassy ground state of gsmo and above @xmath13 in the co / oo insulators is due to orbital redistribution of the excess electrons ( @xmath57 relative to the @xmath58 commensurate level ) which occupy @xmath59 orbitals of originally @xmath50 sites in the long - range ordered state.@xcite their optical transitions dominating the @xmath30-axis conductivity are characterized by a remarkably smaller gap energy as observed in pr@xmath60ca@xmath61mno@xmath2.@xcite the melting of this co / oo phase means the emergence of a charge - orbital liquid state in which the local co / oo correlations are still dominant and together with dynamical jahn - teller effect preserve electron localization . towards high temperatures",

    "this energy scale is considerably lower than in the co / oo insulators but close to that of gsmo .",
    "the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition is associated with a dramatic redistribution of the spectral weight , especially in esmo and ssmo where the instantaneous opening of the charge gap is observed above @xmath14 . in nsmo with larger bandwidth ( and equivalently with higher curie temperature )",
    "the transition occurs in a continuous manner and only a pseudo - gap develops in the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase .",
    "the change in the character of the fm transition ( from first to second order ) between ssmo and nsmo can be well followed in lower panel of fig .",

    ", the gap evaluated at the lowest temperature of the pm phase shows only tiny variation around @xmath67ev till ssmo while it completely vanishes for nsmo .",
    "detailed magneto - transport and magnetization studies also evidence that the first - order pm - fm phase boundary is terminated between ssmo and nsmo and the transition becomes continuous for larger bandwidth.@xcite the presence of first - order phase boundaries ( indicated by thick line in both panels of fig .",
    "1 ) separating the fm state both from the co / oo and pm phase implies dramatic change in the orbital character of @xmath9 electrons . although it is a central issue in the cmr physics , the orbital nature of the fm state has not utterly been clarified . in the present optical study",
    "this question is also to address in the context of the large scattering rate observed in the fully spin polarized low - temperature state .",
    "for the present metals three possible scenarios have been proposed : ( i ) a disordered phase involving both @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbitals @xcite or strong ferro - orbital correlations of either ( ii ) the planar @xmath68-type @xcite or ( iii ) the rod - like @xmath69-type.@xcite in case of ssmo , the development of rod - like order is supported by recent neutron scattering experiments ; the anomalously large fourth - neighbor interaction along @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) direction , @xmath73 , implies the extended one - dimensional exchange path reflecting the rod - like orbital correlation.@xcite the effect of the orthorhombic lattice distortion is almost negligible for ssmo ( which is also the case for esmo and nsmo ) ; the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the nearly equivalent [ 001 ] , [ 010 ] , and [ 100 ] domains prevent the onset of a static long - range orbital ordering for the investigated temperature region .",
    "therefore , we ascribe the large scattering rate of the spin - polarized phase to these orbital fluctuations . the optical isotropy of the @xmath29-plane also implies the lack of long - range order above @xmath26k , thus the robust enhancement of the metallic conductivity in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic transition is attributable to the nearly temperature - independent spin - polarization up to @xmath14 .    at room temperature which is slightly above both the fm and co /",

    "the pseudo - gap like feature of the optical spectra ( i.e. the presence of the mid - infrared peak and the reduced optical weight below it ) is preserved and the metallic conductivity is not recovered up to @xmath4k , indicating the subsisting co / oo correlations up to higher temperatures in this critically doped series of cmr manganites . on the other hand , x - ray experiments on the same materials could detect the diffuse scattering arising from the short - range orbital ordering , but no longer than up to @xmath81k.@xcite this means that above this temperature the correlation length of the lattice distortion is limited to the scale of the unit cell",

    "<S> this paramagnetic region is characterized by a full - gap to pseudo - gap crossover towards elevated temperatures where a broad low - energy electronic structure appears in the conductivity spectra over a large variation of the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this pseudo - gap state with local correlations is robust against thermal fluctuations at least up to @xmath4k . </S>",
    "<S> for small bandwidth the onset of the long - range charge order is accompanied by an instantaneous increase of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the ferromagnetic state is manifested in the optical spectra as a first - order insulator to metal transition for compounds with moderate bandwidth while it becomes a second - order transition on the larger bandwidth side . </S>",
    "<S> unusually large scattering rate of the metallic carriers is observed in the ferromagnetic state which is attributed to orbital correlation with probably rod - like ( @xmath5-like ) character . </S>"
