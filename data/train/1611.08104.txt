    "the graph structure encompasses the qualitative properties of the distribution .",
    "exact probabilistic inference in a general bayesian or markov network is # p - complete  @xcite , which is why one often resorts to markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) gibbs sampling to approximate exact probabilistic inference .",

    "mcmc gibbs sampling can be used in the same way as in ordinary markov networks to perform approximate probabilistic inference , but it suffers from the enormous number of nodes that are generated by the template .    there has been a recent surge of interest in using quantum resources to improve the computational complexity of various tasks in machine learning  @xcite .",

    "we can view boltzmann machines as markov networks with a special topology , in which the largest clique has size two .",
    "one method employed for training boltzmann machines  @xcite is quantum annealing .",
    "it is a global optimization method that relies on actual physical phenomena and it can be used to generate a gibbs distribution . for all current quantum annealing approaches to gibbs sampling ,",
    "restrictions on the topology of the physical hardware remain the main obstacle , which is why the limited clique size of the boltzmann machines is attractive .",
    "an alternative approach of training boltzmann machines is by using gibbs state preparation and sampling protocols , which can also exploit the structure of the graph and achieve polynomial improvements in computational complexity relative to its classical analogue  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we go beyond the training of boltzmann machines and consider more general markov logic networks , keeping the expressiveness of first - order logic and concentrate on inference , rather than training .",

    "one aspect of it is computing the partition function .",
    "the other aspect deals with the problem of assigning probabilities to or finding ( the most ) likely assignment of variables given evidence , that is , given a fixed assignment for a subset of its variables .",
    "this is a hard problem in general : the worst - case complexity of exact probabilistic inference of a graphical model is @xmath22-complete and that of approximate inference is @xmath23-hard  @xcite .    for some common graphical models with a special topology , efficient exact probabilistic inference methods are known .",
    "examples include belief propagation  @xcite and the junction tree algorithm  @xcite .",

    "mcmc is hereby used to approximately sample from the distribution @xmath24 given in or from a suitable conditional probability distribution @xmath25 conditioned on the evidence @xmath26 .",

    "is the method of choice for approximate probabilistic inference with mlns .",
    "while often yielding useful results with an effort far smaller than the worst case complexity , they remain very expensive computationally and so more efficient alternatives are desirable .",
    "the distribution we would like to sample from can be thought of as the gibbs distribution of a suitably constructed physical system .",
    "according to the rules of statistical mechanics , the probability to find a system in a certain state of configuration when it is in thermal equilibrium follows a gibbs distribution .",
    "the distribution can thus be sampled by preparing a suitable physical system in a thermal equilibrium gibbs state and then measuring its configuration .",
    "this is generally rather easy to do at high temperatures , but cooling to low temperatures typically becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "thereby methods of quantum information processing can offer advantages over classical strategies .",
    "they open up fundamentally new ways to of preparing systems approximately in gibbs states in a well - controlled way .",
    "going from the abstract definition of the probability distribution in to a physical model that can be done in the following way : we can think of @xmath27 as the `` energy '' of a system of @xmath28 spin @xmath29 `` particles '' in the quantum state @xmath30 .",
    "the states @xmath30 are then product state vectors in the hilbert space @xmath31 with @xmath32 the complex linear span .",
    "we can think of @xmath33 as the inverse @xmath34 of the `` temperature '' @xmath35 of the system time the boltzmann constant @xmath36 ( other decompositions of the features are also possible ) .",
    "we can try to find a hamiltonian @xmath37 such that we can rewrite the probability distribution from as follows @xmath38 thereby @xmath39 is the hermitian conjugate of the state vector and @xmath40 is the partition function , where @xmath41 is the matrix exponential and @xmath42 the matrix trace .    in the concrete case of an mln the number of particles",
    "@xmath16 is equal to the number of all possible groundings of the atoms in the knowledge base underlying the mln .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath37 inherits the locality structure of the mln : it can be written as a sum @xmath43 of local terms @xmath44 , one for each clique of the mln .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath45 the expression @xmath13 translates to a sum over local terms each acting on one of the cliques produced by grounding out @xmath0 and acting on this clique like @xmath46 times the projector on the subspace of assignments to the atoms in the clique for which @xmath0 evaluates to @xmath14 .",
    "the local terms @xmath44 of the hamiltonian can be constructed from the truth tables of the the @xmath0 and the sum over @xmath47 in the decomposition of @xmath37 collects all such terms for the different values of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ qmln_concepts ] illustrates the matching concepts in mlns and this description .",
    "the number @xmath19 of subsystems on which each such term acts non - trivially is bounded by the maximum number of atoms per formula and its operator norm is bounded by one @xmath48 .",
    "hence is the thermal gibbs distribution of a system of @xmath28 spin @xmath29 particles with a so - called @xmath19-local hamiltonian @xmath37 . to prepare the system in a state that is suitable to sample from it is sufficient to reach a high effective temperature if all weights are of moderate magnitude ( no assignments are strongly suppressed ) , but it is necessary to cool to a low temperature if weights have a high magnitude ( at least one assignment is strongly suppressed ) .",
    "quantum gibbs sampling methods can be used to obtain samples from the gibbs distributions of the type of systems described in the previous section .",
    "typically these methods consist of two phases :    1 .   a preparation phase in which a quantum system is prepared in ( a state close to ) a state encoding information about the gibbs state or such a state itself ; and 2 .   a measurement phase , in which , by performing measurements on this state , samples from the gibbs distribution are obtained .",
    "the measurement phase is trivial , consisting only of local measurements and has complexity @xmath49 .",
    "the known quantum methods for gibbs sampling differ in the kind of resources they require during the preparation , their expected improvement in runtime over classical methods , and the extend to and effort with which their performance for a concrete gibbs distribution can be predicted .",
    "the state prepared in the preparation phase is usually either close to a thermal gibbs state  @xcite at inverse temperature @xmath50 of a given hamiltonian @xmath37 , or to a so - called pure thermal state  @xcite , i.e. , a pure state whose overlap with any energy eigenstates of @xmath37 with energy @xmath51 is proportional to the square root of the gibbs weight @xmath52 .",
    "recently , an algorithm for the computation based approximate preparation of thermal states of arbitrary @xmath19-local hamiltonians has been proposed in  @xcite . for this algorithm a particularly favorable upper bound on the gate complexity  the scaling of the number of elementary operations in the preparation step  is known .",
    "this bound can be expressed in terms of the inverse temperature @xmath50 , the local dimension @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for gibbs states corresponding to mlns ) , the number of local terms in @xmath37 , the gate complexity of time evolution under these terms ( or the size of their support ) and their strength , as well as the value of the partition function @xmath55 , and the final distance to the thermal state @xmath56 .",
    "[ prop : complexity ] assuming that the maximum size of the support of the local terms of the hamiltonian @xmath37 is constant scales at most linear with @xmath28 . ] and that for some constant @xmath57 the number of terms in @xmath37 is in @xmath58 , the overall complexity of the gibbs sampling method from  @xcite is in @xmath59 .",
    "when applying this to the graph structure generated by an mln , @xmath57 can be taken to be the maximum number of atoms in any formula , the maximum size of the supports of the local terms of @xmath37 is equal to the maximum clique size , and the number of terms is the number of cliques in the mln .",
    "so long as the maximum number of atoms in any formula is constant , the above scaling of complexity is achieved .",
    "it is important to note that the complexity does not directly depend on the maximal degree of the mln .",
    "this result improves upon the previously known methods in several respects , but in particular it improves the scaling of the runtime with @xmath60 and @xmath50 . in the natural parameters , the problem size @xmath28 and the precision @xmath56 , this method yields an exponential improvement over the runtime of classical simulated annealing , which scales like @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gap of the markov process , which in interesting cases typically is in @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "however , the exponential dependence on @xmath28 remains .",
    "the possibility of a logarithmic scaling with @xmath60 was anticipated in  @xcite .",
    "this scaling is particularly relevant when small probabilities are to be estimated with small relative error .",
    "following early works  @xcite , several previous methods for quantum gibbs sampling with improved scaling of complexity had been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this in particular concerns the dependence of the runtime on the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath64 or the inverse gap of a markov chain @xmath65 , which was reduced from linear to square root by using techniques such as szegedy s quantum walks , grover s algorithm , phase estimation , or amplitude amplification .",
    "algorithms that speed up the convergence of markov chains with quantum techniques  @xcite often offer more flexibility than such more specific to the problem of preparing thermal states  @xcite . in cases in which the gap a markov chain is much larger than @xmath66 ,",
    "they combine their quantum speedup with the advantage inherent in mcmc . however , the interesting cases are usually those in which @xmath67 and then both types of algorithms perform essentially equally well .",
    "a different method , based on the preparation of microcanonical states , was developed in  @xcite , but has an at least exponential scaling in @xmath68 .    if the hamiltonian @xmath37 has more structure and/or the effective temperature is high , more efficient special purpose procedures are available  @xcite , which however are of limited relevance for inference in mlns .",
    "in addition to that , there exists a quantum generalization of the metropolis sampling algorithm  @xcite , that however does not aim at achieving a speedup , but rather works around the sign problem in fermionic systems and makes mcmc techniques available for general local quantum hamiltonians with non - commuting terms .",
    "as we have seen , quantum methods reduce the complexity of approximate gibbs sampling quite drastically .",
    "still , an exponential scaling with the number of all possible groundings of all atoms @xmath28 remains , and the complexity diverges in the low temperature limit as @xmath50 goes to infinity .",
    "a valid question is : can we hope that future advances will remedy this ?",
    "after all , the quantum gibbs sampling methods presented above are able to do gibbs sampling from hamiltonians much more general than those that can arise from mlns , like ones that have non - commuting terms , for example . yet , the answer is probably negative .",
    "it is highly unlikely that any general purpose quantum algorithm for inference in mlns exists that is efficient in cases with high weights ( i.e. , at low temperatures ) , as this would imply the existence of an efficient algorithm for solving satisfiability problems more general than 3-sat , which is known to be np - complete by the cook ",
    "levin theorem  @xcite .",
    "further , the @xmath69 scaling of complexity is known to be optimal for hamiltonian simulation  @xcite and hence for any gibbs sampling method based on it .",
    "the situation is different in the high temperature regime , where more efficient gibbs sampling methods exist  @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of working with lifting at the first - order level is that we save potentially exponentially many groundings given the compact representation when we count the models in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probability_mln ] ) .",
    "there are trivial cases : for instance , when there are no shared variables between the atoms , then there is a closed form to calculate the number of satisfied groundings  @xcite . here",
    "we follow the outlines of lifted importance sampling  @xcite , but without reference to an importance or proposal distribution : our aim is to reduce the complexity of the generated markov network and potentially split it into disconnected graphs when computing the partition function .",
    "we run quantum gibbs sampling on the smaller network and post - process the result with some book - keeping values to return the value of the partition function .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : liftedmln ] summarizes the steps .",
    "since the sampling is not based on a proposal distribution , the actual variance will depend on the error term that estimates the accuracy of the quantum gibbs sampler .",
    "we follow the simplification steps from lifted importance sampling to cater to the critical parts of quantum thermal state preparation , but in principle , the sampling part of the algorithm can also use classical mcmc gibbs sampling . for this reason ,",
    "algorithm  [ alg : liftedmln ] does not specify what kind of gibbs sampling protocol we use .",
    "if we have a normal - form network as the input , that is , all domains have size one , we can run the gibbs sampler and return the value of the partition function .",
    "the first interesting case is if we detect a _",
    "decomposer_this can be done in linear time  that is , a set of logical variables @xmath3 such that ( i ) every atom in @xmath10 contains exactly one variable from @xmath3 , and ( ii ) for every predicate @xmath70 there exists a position such that variables from @xmath3 only appear at that position .",
    "if we have a decomposer , @xmath10 can be simplified to @xmath71 $ ] that is obtained by substituting all variables in @xmath3 by the same constant @xmath72 in @xmath73 , @xmath74 , then converting the result to normal form .",
    "the partition function is calculated as @xmath75)\\right)^{|d_x|}$ ] .",
    "the next structural simplification comes from _ isolated variables_one such variable in a predicate @xmath70 at position @xmath76 is exclusive to @xmath70 in all formulas containing @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath3 denote all isolated variables of @xmath70 and @xmath77 the rest of the variables , and @xmath78 .",
    "we obtain a simplified mln @xmath79 $ ] by generating the groundings of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , deleting the formulas that evaluate @xmath14 or @xmath82 , deleting all groundings of @xmath70 , and normalizing the result .",
    "we get a combinatorial multiplier term to adjust the value of the partition function .    a normal mln @xmath10 the value of the partition function @xmath83 run gibbs sampler to obtain @xmath83 @xmath83",

    "choose an atom @xmath91 @xmath92 ls(@xmath93 ) .",
    "the final simplification is known as the _ generalized binomial rule _ , which relies on singleton atoms that do not appear more than once in the same formula .",
    "given such an atom @xmath94 , we can simplify the mln as @xmath90 , where @xmath95 is a truth assignment to all groundings of @xmath70 such that exactly @xmath96 groundings are set to @xmath14 .",
    "the simplified network is obtained by grounding all @xmath94 and setting all its groundings to match the assignment given by @xmath95 , deleting the formulas that evaluate @xmath14 or @xmath82 , deleting all groundings of @xmath70 , and normalizing the result .",
    "we can compute the partition function by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the exponentiated sum of the formulas that evaluate to @xmath14 , and @xmath99 is the number of ground atoms that are removed when removing the formulas .",
    "if we can not find any heuristics , we have to resort to fully grounding out an atom , normalizing the result , and continuing with the remaining expressions .",
    "if we look at probabilistic inference given evidence , at the level of the quantum protocol , this can be done in at least two ways : first , to the hamiltonian @xmath37 one can add some strong local `` clamping '' terms , effectively forcing some of the assignments to the desired values .",
    "this is convenient from an implementation point of view , as it only requires few local changes in the hamiltonian simulation procedure  @xcite underlying the algorithm of  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be difficult to quantify the additional error due to the finite clamping strength and adding very strong clamping terms unfavorably affect the runtime of the algorithm .",
    "second , one can construct the local terms @xmath44 not from the full truth tables of the @xmath0 , but instead use reduced truth tables given the evidence , to construct local terms @xmath44 that act non - trivially only on the grounded atoms for which no evidence exists .",
    "this can only decrease the maximal weight ( i.e. , increase the temperature @xmath100 ) , decrease the number of terms ( in case some of them become completely trivial ) , and reduce the number of sites @xmath28 .",
    "gibbs sampling with the new hamiltonian is hence always at most as computationally costly as with the original hamiltonian .",
    "we can also use classical heuristics before employing the quantum protocol , as in the algorithm described in section  [ sec : partfunc ] .",
    "for first - order lifting methods , the presence of evidence is a problem , as it skews symmetries and potentially leads to a complete grounding out . to avoid this , @xcite proposed a distance function on the partially clamped network , and suggested a clustering to find clusters of similar groundings .",
    "all groundings in a cluster are replaced by their cluster center , reducing the overall network size to to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is maximum cluster size , compared to the original @xmath103 .",
    "this in turn reduces @xmath28 in the overall complexity of the quantum gibbs sampling protocol , as stated in proposition  [ prop : complexity ] .",
    "we hope that by fostering knowledge exchange between communities , for example concerning the typical properties of gibbs distributions relevant for machine learning , progress towards more realistic and useful quantum algorithms can be made . in summary",
    ", we addressed the following aspects of probabilistic inference in mlns :    * we analyzed the computational complexity of the state - of - the - art quantum gibbs sampling protocol given the structural properties of mlns and we argued the theoretical limits of the approach .",
    "a term in the computational complexity reduces exponentially , albeit the overall complexity remains exponential in the number of nodes . *",
    "understanding the impact of the properties of the graph generated by an mln on the computational complexity of quantum gibbs sampling , we adapted a classical first - order lifting algorithm to reduce the complexity of the network .",
    "the algorithm mirrors lifted importance sampling , but instead of using a proposal distribution , it uses either classical mcmc or quantum gibbs sampling . *",
    "we studied the effects of evidence on quantum gibbs sampling .",
    "the protocols we considered rely on a universal quantum computer , which , given the hurdles in implementation , is still mainly of academic interest .",
    "we can , however , turn to methods that use current or near future quantum annealing devices , for instance , technology using quantum annealing with manufactured spins  @xcite . in this technology ,",
    "the distribution of excited states after annealing follows approximately a boltzmann distribution  @xcite , albeit one has to pay attention to estimating persistent biases and the effective temperature estimation  @xcite .",
    "this technology was used , for instance , for learning the structure of a bayesian network  @xcite , but the restricted connectivity between the spins causes difficulties for arbitrary graph structures , in contrast to the methods discussed here .",
    "recent progress allows embedding arbitrary graphs , albeit at a quadratic cost in the number of spins in the worst - case scenario  @xcite , and there is also a proposal for a quantum annealing architecture with all - to - all connectivity  @xcite .",
    "given the techniques described in this paper , it would be interesting to see whether we can achieve a scalable implementation with contemporary quantum annealing technologies , since machine learning demonstrations with this paradigm mainly focused on boltzmann machines so far : mlns have different topological features than boltzmann machines , but they also have regularities that might allow an efficient embedding and subsequent inference .",

    "<S> markov logic networks ( mlns ) reconcile two opposing schools in machine learning and artificial intelligence : causal networks , which account for uncertainty extremely well , and first - order logic , which allows for formal deduction . </S>",
    "<S> an mln is essentially a first - order logic template to generate markov networks . </S>",
    "<S> inference in mlns is probabilistic and it is often performed by approximate methods such as markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) gibbs sampling . </S>",
    "<S> an mln has many regular , symmetric structures that can be exploited at both first - order level and in the generated markov network . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the graph structures that are produced by various lifting methods and investigate the extent to which quantum protocols can be used to speed up gibbs sampling with state preparation and measurement schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we review different such approaches , discuss their advantages , theoretical limitations , and their appeal to implementations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a straightforward application of a recent result yields exponential speedup compared to classical heuristics in approximate probabilistic inference , thereby demonstrating another example where advanced quantum resources can potentially prove useful in machine learning . </S>"
