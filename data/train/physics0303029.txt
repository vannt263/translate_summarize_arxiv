    "there is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of the @xmath1he three - atomic system ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the non - symmetric system @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 found comparatively little attention .",
    "we can only mention the recent works @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite where the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 trimers were treated alongside with small @xmath1he clusters . until now",
    "only the bound states of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 system have been studied numerically .",
    "there are still no scattering calculations reported for this system .",
    "the @xmath1he trimer is known in particular for the efimov s nature of its excited state ( see @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath1he dimer is extremely small ( about 1 mk ) on the molecular scale .",
    "the large spatial extension of the @xmath1he@xmath2 bound state generates a long - range effective interaction between a @xmath1he dimer and additional @xmath1he atom which results in a possibility of existence of extremely extended @xmath1he three - atomic states .    being a more light particle than @xmath1he ,",
    "the @xmath0he atom supports no bound state with the @xmath1he counterpart and no @xmath0he dimer exists .",
    "thus , the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 is even a more loosely bound system than the @xmath1he trimer . according to the hyperspherical adiabatic calculations of @xcite and monte - carlo investigation of @xcite the realistic he",
    "- he potentials such as lm2m2 @xcite and tty @xcite support only one bound state of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 trimer with the energy of the order of 1015 mk .",
    "notice that the @xmath1he/@xmath0he three - atomic systems belong to the three  body systems whose theoretical treatment is quite difficult .",
    "the difficulty is mainly due to the two reasons .",
    "first , the low energy of the practically on - threshold bound states makes it necessary to consider very large domains in configuration space with a size of hundreds of  .",
    "second , the strong repulsive part of the he - he interaction at short distances produces large numerical errors . like @xcite",
    ", the present work is based on a mathematically rigorous hard - core version of the faddeev differential equations .",
    "this method allows to overcome the strong - repulsion problem .",
    "the first of the problems just mentioned is tackled by choosing sufficiently large grids .",
    "this note represents rather a first step in an extension of the numerical approach of @xcite to the case of three - body systems including particles with different masses . in the nearest future",
    "we plan not only to continue our study of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 bound state but also to perform calculations of the scattering of a @xmath0he atom off a @xmath1he@xmath2 dimer . here",
    "we only outline the method employed and report our first results for the binding energy of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 system .",
    "in describing the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 three - atomic system we use the reduced jacobi coordinates @xcite @xmath3 , @xmath4 , expressed in terms of the position vectors of the atoms @xmath5 and their masses @xmath6 , @xmath7^{1/2 }    ( { \\bf   r}_\\beta - { \\bf   r}_\\gamma)\\\\&&\\\\ \\nonumber         { \\bf   y}_\\alpha & = &   \\left[\\frac        { 2{\\rm m}_\\alpha({\\rm m}_\\beta + { \\rm m}_\\gamma ) }         { { \\rm m}_\\alpha + { \\rm m}_\\beta + { \\rm m}_\\gamma}\\right]^{1/2 }       \\left ( { \\bf   r}_\\alpha -\\frac{{\\rm m}_\\beta{\\bf   r}_\\beta +     { \\rm m}_\\gamma{\\bf r}_\\gamma } { { \\rm m}_\\beta + { \\rm m}_\\gamma}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 stand for a cyclic permutation of the atom numbers @xmath9 . the coordinates @xmath10 fix the six - dimensional vector @xmath11 .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 corresponding to the same point @xmath13 as the pair @xmath14 are obtained using the transformations @xmath15 where @xmath16 in the following we assume that the @xmath1he atoms are assigned the numbers 1 and 2 while the @xmath1he atom has the number 3 . by @xmath17 we denote the hard - core radius which will be taken the same ( in coordinates @xmath18 ) for all three inter - atomic interaction potentials .",
    "a recent detail description of the faddeev differential equations in the hard - core model which we employ can be found in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we outline here some essential characteristics of the hard - core faddeev approach needed for understanding our numerical procedure .",
    "since the @xmath1he atoms are identical bosons the corresponding faddeev component @xmath19 is invariant under the permutations the particles 1 and 2 which implies @xmath20 the identity of the two @xmath1he atoms also implies that the faddeev components @xmath21 and @xmath22 are obtained from each other by a simple rotation of the coordinate space .",
    "thus , we only have two independent faddeev components , the one associated with the @xmath1he@xmath1he subsystem , @xmath23 , and another one , say @xmath24 , associated with a pair of @xmath0he and @xmath1he atoms .",
    "the resulting hard - core faddeev equations read @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the total wave function @xmath28 of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2-system written via the faddeev components @xmath29 and @xmath30 in different coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "we apply the above formalism to the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 three - atomic system with total angular momentum @xmath39 . expanding the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 in a series of bispherical harmonics we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "we employed the faddeev equations ( [ fparts ] ) , the hard - core boundary condition ( [ hcparts ] ) , and the asymptotic condition ( [ hebs ] ) to calculate the binding energy of the helium trimer @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 . as he - he interaction we used the semi - empirical lm2m2 potential of aziz and slaman @xcite and the latest theoretical potential tty of tang , toennies and yiu @xcite . in our present calculations",

    "both the lm2m2 and tty potentials produce a weakly bound state for the @xmath1he dimer .",
    "we found that the @xmath1he - dimer energy is 1.309mk in case the lm2m2 interaction and 1.316mk for the tty potential .",
    "both lm2m2 and tty support no bound state for the @xmath1he@xmath0he two - atomic system .    as in @xcite",
    "we considered a finite - difference approximation of the boundary - value problem ( [ fparts ] , [ hcparts ] , [ hebs ] ) in the polar coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "also the method for choosing the grid radii @xmath78 ( and , thus , the grid hyperangles @xmath79 ) was the same as described in @xcite .",
    "in the present investigation we were restricted to considering only the two lowest partial components @xmath80 and @xmath81 and therefore we only dealt with the two partial equations of the system ( [ fparts ] ) corresponding to @xmath60 .",

    "this method makes it possible to avoid using disk storage for the matrix during the computation .",
    "the best possible dimensions of the grids which we employed in this investigation were @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we found that on the @xmath84 grid with @xmath85 the lm2m2 potential supports the bound state of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 with the energy @xmath86mk while the corresponding binding energy produced by the tty potential is @xmath87mk .",
    "our figures for @xmath88 correspond to the lowest possible dimension of the system ( [ fparts ] ) .",
    "we consider this as reason why our results show a significant underboundedness of the @xmath0he@xmath1he@xmath2 trimer as compared to the available results for @xmath88 obtained for the tty potential on the basis of the variational vmc ( 9.585mk @xcite ) and dmc ( 14.165mk @xcite ) methods and for the lm2m2 potential on the basis of a one - channel hyperespherical adibatic approximation of the faddeev differential equations ( 9.682mk @xcite ) and ( 10.22mk @xcite ) .",
    "we think the situation will change when more partial waves in ( [ fparts ] ) will be employed .",
    "a certain ( but rather small ) deepening of the binding energy @xmath88 may also be expected due to choosing the grids with larger @xmath89 and @xmath90 ."
