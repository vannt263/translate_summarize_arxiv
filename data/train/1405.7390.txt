    "the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) program was initiated by nasa and the german aerospace center , _ deutsches zentrum fr luft - und raumfahrt _ ( dlr ) to support the international astronomical community in scientific investigations of the nature and evolution of the universe , the origin and evolution of galaxies , stars , and planetary systems , as well as conditions that led to the origins of life . as the successor to the kuiper airborne observatory ,",
    "sofia and its science instruments provide astronomers with imaging and spectroscopic capabilities over a large spectral range ( 0.3 @xmath0 m to 1.6 mm ) , but most notably at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths not available from ground - based observatories .",
    "data acquisition is made through frequent flight missions in the earth s stratosphere at observing altitudes between 11.3 km and 13.7 km ( 37,000 and 45,000 feet ) , above 99% atmospheric water vapor , allowing greater atmospheric transmission than available from ground - based observatories .",
    "generally , sofia excels at those observations that demand some combination of good mid and/or far  infrared atmospheric transmission , reasonably high spatial resolution , very high spectral resolution , and/or the ability to rapidly deploy to a specific location on the earth .",
    "the sofia observatory consists of a 2.5 m effective aperture telescope developed by dlr mounted inside a uniquely modified boeing 747sp aircraft .",
    "the aircraft was originally acquired by pan american world airways in 1977 may .",
    "the `` sp '' designates a special short - body version of the 747 , designed for longer flights than the original -100 series of the boeing 747 .",
    "the 747sp is 14.6 m shorter than a standard 747 - 100 , but with the same engines , wingspan , and fuel tanks , making the aircraft lighter and thus extending its range and altitude performance .",
    "the increased range made the sp an ideal choice for the extended - duration missions required for sofia observations . in 1986 february",
    ", united airlines purchased the plane and eventually removed it from active service in 1995 december .",
    "after nasa acquired the 747sp in 1997 , the aircraft was substantially modified for its new role as a flying astronomical observatory by l-3 communications integrated systems of waco , texas .",
    "the telescope views astronomical objects through a large articulating open cavity on the port side of the aircraft fuselage , aft of the wing .",
    "a pressure bulkhead separates the unpressurized telescope optics compartment from the forward passenger cabin ; the telescope extends through this pressure barrier with a science instrument ( si ) mounted in the pressurized passenger section , providing hands - on access for astronomical investigators and control of the si during flight .",
    "the fuselage was further modified by the installation of doors that move in concert with the telescope to minimize the surface area of the cavity exposed to the aircraft slipstream . to meet the challenges of accurate telescope pointing and vibration suppression in a challenging environment , telescope systems isolate , dampen , and actively suppress vibration , while the telescope itself is inertially stabilized by a combination of gyroscopes and guide cameras .",
    "access to the telescope cavity is provided through a door in the aft section when the aircraft is on the ground .",
    "a cutaway schematic of the sofia observatory is presented in @xcite .",
    "sofia has six first - generation instruments , both imagers and spectrographs , covering a wide range in wavelength and spectral resolution .",
    "an additional second - generation instrument will add the unique provision of far infrared polarimetry .",
    "four facility science instruments , forcast @xcite , flitecam @xcite , fifi  ls @xcite and hawc+ @xcite , will be maintained and operated by sofia staff , while two principal investigator - class science instruments , great @xcite and exes @xcite , and a special purpose principal investigator - class science instrument , hipo @xcite , are maintained by their respective instrument teams .",
    "+ general characteristics of the current suite of sofia science instruments , their capabilities and performance are summarized in a recent publication by @xcite    key to successful operations of the sofia observatory is the optimized planning of various operational and developmental activities .",
    "this includes observatory operations planning , science call and selection , and observing cycle planning and scheduling .",
    "the most distinctive aspect of sofia flight planning is the interdependency of the targets observed in a flight . because the azimuthal pointing is controlled primarily by the aircraft heading and because , in normal operations , the take - off and landing air fields are the same , efficient flight plans balance east - bound with west - bound flight legs and south - bound with north - bound legs .",
    "a consequential constraint is that only a limited fraction of the observing can be performed in a given region of the sky during a flight .",
    "the sofia observatory achieved first light in 2010 may and is planning to eventually make more than 120 scientific flights per year , with an expected operational life of at least 20 yr .",
    "sofia operates primarily from nasa armstrong flight research center s aircraft operations facility in palmdale , ca .",
    "sofia leverages its mobility by occasionally operating from other locations around the world , particularly in the southern hemisphere , to access targets not observable during flights from palmdale .",
    "sofia also is capable of deploying for targets of opportunity , such as occultations , flying to a particular latitude and longitude to best observe an event . except for the combination of hipo and flitecam , which can be flown together ,",
    "only one science instrument is flown at a time .",
    "observations with a given instrument are typically conducted in two - week flight series comprised of up to eight science flights .",
    "sofia began early science operations in 2010 december , demonstrating the observatory s potential to make discoveries about the infrared universe , with observations made by science instrument teams as well as through peer - reviewed proposals selected through a competed international solicitation .",
    "an overview of sofia system characteristics and high level requirements is presented in table  [ tbl : system ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : flightplan ] shows combined flight plans flown during the early science phase , including a southern hemisphere deployment to new zealand .",
    "additional details on the aircraft and mission operations can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , observations of targets requiring long integrations may have to be done over multiple flights and flight legs .",
    "sofia performed 9 science flights during its three week deployment to christchurch , new zealand from 2012 july 12 to august 2 .",

    "the aircraft takeoff on the eve of 2010 november 30 marked the initiation of sofias early science phase .",
    "this opening chapter of sofia astronomical observations covered 12 months of science operations phased with ongoing observatory and aircraft improvement and test activities , and resulted in 32 science flights involving 3 different instruments ( forcast , great and hipo ) .",
    "the observations were performed in association with both observatory time dedicated to the three science instrument teams and awarded to the community through a peer - reviewed observing proposal competition .",
    "the successful execution of early science demonstrated the observatory s potential to make discoveries about the infrared universe .",
    "all data obtained during early science is now publicly available through the sofia data archive .",
    "results from much of these data have been published in special issues of _ the astrophysical journal letters _ ( 2012 , vol .",
    "749 part 2 ) and the _ astronomy & astophysics _ journal ( 2012 , vol .",
    "542 ) . in just this first year of science flights ,",
    "sofia has furnished ample proof of its worth and future promise to infrared astronomers @xcite . during that time , the facility has provided data to support several interstellar molecular line studies , including the first observations of the neutral forms of the mercapto ( sh ) and deuterated hydroxyl ( od ) radicals @xcite .",
    "the observatory also demonstrated its capability for mapping strong coolant lines such as [ ] , assuring a continuity of such studies now that _",
    "herschel _ is decommissioned .",
    "sofia has also exercised its high spectral resolution to conduct detailed gas dynamics studies .",
    "the observatory s unique mobility played a significant role in the capture of an occultation of pluto @xcite , which supported an investigation of the dwarf planet s atmosphere , information that is also valuable to ongoing planning of nasa s new horizons pluto fly - by mission .",
    "finally , the value of sofia s high spatial resolution in the mid - infrared was established through imaging of several star - forming regions and the galactic center .",
    "sofia - great was used to provide interstellar observations of the od and sh molecules .",
    "despite the fact that these radicals play significant roles in astrochemistry , they had never been directly observed in the ism until the sofia observations were made .",
    "whether water forms predominantly in the gas phase or requires dust grain surface chemistry in low temperature environments is the question tackled by @xcite , using observations of ground - state od transitions at 1391.5 ghz in absorption against a source continuum ( a low mass protostar ) . in general ,",
    "a high `` fractionization '' ( percentage of deuterated molecules ) suggests molecular formation in the gas phase .",
    "previous observations of the envelopes of young stars have indicated the deuterium fraction of water is anomalously low in comparison to that of other molecules .",
    "the inferred od / hdo ratio measured by @xcite is consistent with this previously - noted trend , and has a value that is much higher than can be predicted by standard chemical models that incorporate both gas phase and dust chemistries .",
    "the exothermic oh  +  d exchange , along with gas - phase dissociative recombinations of hydronium that have non - trivial branching ratios for the formation of water and hydroxyl , could together significantly enhance the fractionation of oh relative to water , accounting for the measured enhancement of od relative to deuterated water .",
    "sulfur is associated with hydrides and hydride cations ( e.g. , s , sh , s@xmath1 , h@xmath2s@xmath1 ) that undergo an endothermic , rather than exothermic , hydrogen atom abstraction reaction with h@xmath2 . previous measurements of column densities of sulfur - bearing hydrides in diffuse molecular clouds and dense regions of active star formation suggest that the endothermic reactions occur at a high rate in spite of the cold environments .",
    "sofia - great observations of sh in absorption at 1383 ghz along a sight - line to a submillimeter continuum source were made with the intent of elucidating the nature of this apparent paradox @xcite .",
    "the detections comprise the first such observation of this neutral molecule within the ism .",
    "the measured sh / h@xmath2s ratio , which combined ground - based millimeter observations with the sofia data , is significantly smaller than values predicted by standard models of photodissociation regions including the effects of turbulence and shocks .",
    "the tentative conclusion of this investigation , pending future detailed modeling , is that h@xmath2s abundance could be explained by the dissociative recombination of molecular ions in environments in which a significant ion - neutral drift is present : if the newly - formed neutral species have initial velocities representative of the ionized parents from which they formed , the kinetic energy could promote endothermic reactions with h@xmath2 before being dissipated into the lower - velocity neutral fluid .",
    "these two first - time observations of sh and od were made possible by sofia largely due to great s bandpass coverage across the frequency gap that exists between bands 5 and 6 of _",
    "herschel_-hifi , where these two lines appear .",
    "observations of the earliest phases of star formation is necessary to identify the dominant regulating physical processes such as accretion . in the past",
    ", measurements of mass infall rates have typically been determined in an indirect fashion through observations of emission features whose interpretation is based on an idealized model in which the back to the front sides of the region of infalling gas contribute to the profile , and for which self - absorption produces a dominant blue peak . however , such a signature profile can also result from factors related to kinematics or composition , and therefore mass infall rates derived from such data often have a high degree of uncertainty .",
    "recent sofia - great observations of the ammonia molecule nh@xmath3 , which has low excitation temperature transitions and is a molecule not likely to freeze out in the initial coldest stages of molecular clumps , demonstrate an alternative tool that produces a direct measurement of mass infall in the earliest stages of star formation @xcite .",
    "the observed absorption line at 1810.4 ghz of three different sources showed a distinct redshift relative to the systemic velocity , and provided a direct measure of infall rates whose values were sufficiently high to indicate sustained collapse .",
    "sofia took advantage of the opportunity to observe the dwarf planet pluto as it passed in front of a distant star @xcite .",
    "this occultation allowed scientific analysis of pluto and its atmosphere by flying sofia at a specific moment to an exact location where pluto s shadow fell on earth .",
    "this event was the first demonstration of one of sofia s major design capabilities .",
    "pluto s shadow traveled at 85,000 @xmath4 h across a mostly empty stretch of the pacific ocean .",
    "sofia flew more than 2900 km out over the southern pacific from its base in southern california to position itself in the center of the shadow s path , and was the only observatory capable of taking such observations for this event .",
    "data collected by the science instrument hipo , in coordination with the fpi , provided a strong detection of the occultation .",
    "the light curve produced from the acquired photometry provided a detailed assessment of the physical state of pluto s atmosphere through measurements of pressure , density and temperature profiles .",
    "the atmosphere is subject to cycles of alternating global collapse and distention as pluto moves through its eccentric and significantly inclined orbit .",
    "a near - term future collapse is anticipated based on model predictions , but the data indicate that a supported atmosphere was present at the time of the observations .",
    "certain aspects of the light curve , including the presence of an apparently suppressed central flash signature , have been found to require some combination of a thermal inversion and a haze layer to explain them , as well as the presence of strong global winds @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared images of various star - forming regions within the orion nebula were taken with sofia - forcast using multiple filters spanning the 1937 @xmath0 m range .",
    "the high spatial resolution of these images enabled the identification of the dominant luminosity sources within the bn / kl region @xcite .",
    "model fits to the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) constructed from the observations of young stellar objects within omc-2 provided a characterization of their immediate environments @xcite , providing a rudimentary census of protostars with infalling envelopes , young stars with circumstellar disks , and young binary systems .",
    "a similar observing mode was used to acquire images of unprecedented spatial resolution of the galactic center .",
    "temperature maps and column densities @xcite were derived for the massive gas clouds that lie @xmath5 from the galactic center s supermassive black hole ( sgr a * ) , within the circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) .",
    "the associated analysis suggests that the cnr clouds are transient features , with densities too low to prevent tidal disruption .",
    "a similar conclusion was determined through analysis of co spectra taken with sofia - great @xcite .",
    "recent test runs and a whole year of science observations have shown the sofia observatory to be primarily on - track in meeting its mission performance requirements .",
    "certain areas such as image stabilization , pointing , and tracking pose challenges which are being iteratively improved through the application of several passive and active technologies such as mechanical dampers , upgraded and more sensitive guide cameras , and refined pointing feedback software .",
    "in other areas , such as the demonstration of deployment readiness and ability to acquire a transient observation such as an occultation , the observatory performance has leapt far ahead of its scheduled capabilities .",
    "the topics of early science investigations were diverse , ranging from the development of new tools to measure the mass accretion rate on protostars in their most nascent phases of formation , to studies assessing the fate of features within the circumnuclear ring surrounding the galaxy s supermassive black hole , to `` first discoveries '' of common yet elusive diatomic molecules in the interstellar medium whose measurements will bear on highly relevant topics such as the formation and evolution of water in protoplanetary systems and thermo - dynamic processes in cold molecular clouds .",
    "these recent successes of the sofia observatory provide substantial credence to sofia s ability and readiness to serve the world s scientific community for a wide range of unique observations in its anticipated extensive 20 yr - lifespan ."
