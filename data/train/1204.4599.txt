    "since the original work of bender and boettcher @xcite , there have been many studies of @xmath0-symmetric systems and in the last few years the literature on such systems has expanded rapidly . in particular , in the seminal paper mentioned above , the authors showed that a set or spectrum of real eigenvalues could be obtained for @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians of the form @xmath1 , the `` extended @xmath0 oscillator '' .",
    "they found that , when @xmath4 , @xmath0-symmetry is realised as a manifest symmetry and consequently all eigenvalues are real ; for @xmath5 , the @xmath0-symmetry is partially broken , and only a finite number of real eigenvalues exist .",
    "below @xmath6 , the @xmath0-symmetry may be completely broken ; however , the situation is this case has not yet been examined in detail .",
    "the feature of a phase transition between a manifest and a broken phase is a natural consequence that can be expected in any theory displaying two different phases .",
    "such a phase transition has been a major focus of investigation and details can be found in @xcite for this set of hamiltonians .",
    "a further discussion can be found in bender s review article , in which several examples are presented @xcite .",
    "several other papers published since then explore the properties of one - dimensional systems , such as the @xmath0-symmetric square - well problem @xcite , or @xmath0-symmetric matrix hamiltonians , see examples in @xcite . in all of these papers , the aim was to elucidate the point that @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians , even if they appear nonconventional , can display a spectrum of real eigenvalues and that a phase transition from a symmetric to a broken phase can occur .",
    "recently , it was argued that bosonic field theories described by the ( euclidean ) lagrangian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive integer , can admit _ several families _ of real eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this raises the question as to whether the quantum - mechanical hamiltonians @xmath9 for the extended @xmath0-symmetric oscillator admit several real spectra and not just one for each value of @xmath10 as shown in @xcite , and , if so , whether one can classify the number of families of solutions that are generated . in this paper",
    ", we address this question for the hamiltonians @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and thereafter discuss the systematics in the field - theoretical case for the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , for different values of @xmath8 . in doing so",
    ", we also aim at giving a primer on the techniques of complex analysis used , so that this paper is self - contained and can be regarded as an introduction to this subject .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in section [ basic ] , we give an overview of the results , review the basic methodology of analysing the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions in the complex plane , and discuss how families of real solutions can arise .",
    "the analysis is based on the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "exact results are presently only obtainable numerically and a rigorous proof that the eigenvalues are all real is difficult",
    ". analytic continuation of the eigenvalue problem has been discussed , for example , for the anharmonic oscillator in @xcite .    in section [ mech ] , we apply the methodology to the hamiltonians @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for positive integral values of @xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and in section [ field ] to the generalized field - theoretic bosonic lagrangian , with n taking values from 0 to 2 in steps of @xmath21 .",
    "symmetry in parity and time is expressed by the four relations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is an antilinear operator , @xmath27 . using this prescription",
    ", it is easily verified that @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are all @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "it is also obvious that the quantum - mechanical hamiltonians @xmath17 and @xmath18 are hermitian in the dirac sense , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this is also true for @xmath16 , for certain values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is the case , for example , when @xmath29 ; then @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 , and so on .",
    "these hamiltonians all appear bounded from below , and each is known to possess a spectrum of real eigenvalues . however , by choosing appropriate @xmath0-symmetric boundary conditions , one can show that these hamiltonians ( with @xmath33 ) in fact have @xmath34 different sets of eigenvalues or families , which in the wkb approximation take on real values .",
    "that is , the first hamiltonian , @xmath35 , has only one real spectrum , @xmath36 may display two families of solutions , or have two real spectra , and @xmath37 may have three families with real solutions , or three possible spectra of real eigenvalues .    continuing to examine @xmath16",
    ", one notes that for @xmath38 , these operators take on the form @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and so on , all of which are hermitian , but which otherwise appear unbounded from below .",
    "this set of hamiltonians , however , can also exhibit spectra of real eigenvalues when @xmath0-symmetric boundary conditions are imposed . here",
    "the number of families that can occur is given by @xmath42 .",
    "that is , @xmath43 may possess a single spectrum of real eigenvalues , @xmath44 may possess two real spectra , while @xmath45 may have three .",
    "finally , the last possible choices of @xmath10 for @xmath16 , @xmath10 odd , lead to hamiltonians that are manifestly @xmath0-symmetric but not hermitian : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48  . in these cases @xmath49 families appear that can have real eigenvalues .    the basic methodology underlying these results and which is generally applicable to other systems involves an analysis of the eigenfunctions in the complex plane .",
    "both in @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics and in scalar field theory , integrals occur whose integration paths can , in the most general case , be taken to lie in the complex plane . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the wave function is obtained by integrating the schrdinger equation and imposing boundary conditions , while in field theory , the properties of the system can be derived from the functional integral formulation of the action in terms of the lagrangian . in each case , one has to analyse the convergence properties of the integral ; independent paths in the complex plane correspond to the possible existence of individual families with spectra containing real eigenvalues . in the following it is described how , with the help of the symmetries of the regions of convergence of the controlling asymptotic factors , the number of real spectra possible both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory can be deduced .",
    "we follow the methodology sketched in @xcite .",
    "+ the first step in dealing with the problem is to identify the regions of convergence of the asymptotic wave function , known as stokes wedges .",
    "figure [ fig : x80 ] shows these regions associated with the hamiltonian @xmath50 , as an example .",
    "( stokes wedges).,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    as there are always two linearly independent solutions of the schrdinger equation , one finds that the exponential behaviour of one solution decays in certain regimes ( denoted as unshaded stokes wedges ) , while the second solution grows in this region .",
    "alternately , the exponential part of the second solution decays in the shaded regions , while the first solution grows .",
    "thus , a wave function can always be found whose exponential behaviour converges to zero for large @xmath51 in some wedge of the complex plane , and the shaded and unshaded regions reflect the difference in sign occurring in the exponent that causes the falling or rising asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the lines separating the wedges are called stokes lines and these are the lines along which the solution is purely oscillatory .",
    "an integration path , however , must lie in regions in which the solution converges to zero asymptotically .",
    "many paths are possible , but not all necessarily lead to a spectrum that can contain real eigenvalues .",
    "we conjecture that _ the number of paths that can possibly lead to distinct real solutions is given by the number of pairs of noncontiguous @xmath0-symmetric stokes wedges , i.e. stokes wedges that are symmetric to the imaginary axis , while two pairs of stokes wedges which are symmetric to the real axis may only be counted once . _",
    "hence an integration path leads to a spectrum with real eigenvalues only if it ends in stokes wedges that are @xmath0-symmetrically arranged .    in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x80 ] , following the conjecture above , we see by inspection that the system can admit two different real spectra : the shaded pair of stokes wedges lying under the real axis are @xmath0-symmetric to one another .",
    "this is also the case for the two unshaded stokes wedges lying directly below the real axis .",
    "the reflection of this structure into the upper half - plane does not bring new solutions . as has already been noted ,",
    "this case is special in that in hermitian quantum mechanics it has no bound states and it only displays a continuous real spectrum , as it is not bounded below . as one can see , the real axis is not an admissible integration path , reflecting this behaviour . in this example , however , we note that there are 10 different wedges in the complex plane . in the next section",
    "we will examine the number of classical turning points - in this case there are 8 .",
    "however , only two pairs can be identified that are @xmath0-symmetric to one another , meaning that two possible spectra of real eigenvalues can exist .",
    "this forms the basis of the conjecture made above .    in scalar quantum field theory",
    "the number of real spectra can be ascertained in a similar fashion . in apposition to quantum mechanics , where the sign of the determining integral comes from the wave function and its asymptotic behaviour always allows for a convergent solution , the sign in quantum field theory is fixed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the determining integral is the euclidean action , which has a fixed sign .",
    "thus , one finds alternating regions of convergence and divergence , limiting the number of families of solutions that a bosonic field theory can give rise to .",
    "figure [ fig : fi100 ] shows the pattern of regions of convergence and divergence for the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) when n=2 in one dimension , i.e. for an interaction proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "regions of convergence for the @xmath53 one dimensional scalar field theory ( stokes wedges ) , shaded in grey.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this case , the unshaded areas refer to divergent regions .",
    "the integration path may thus only lie in the shaded regions . as in quantum mechanics , only paths lying in pairs of @xmath0-symmetric stokes wedges lead to real eigenvalues . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of real families of solutions is also given by the number of unique pairs of @xmath0-symmetric stokes wedges . in this case , it is seen by inspection that there are three pairs of convergent wedges that are arranged @xmath0-symmetrically .",
    "thus three families or spectra can be identified .",
    "in this section we apply the procedure outlined in section [ basic ] to the quantum - mechanical hamiltonians @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath54 to determine the number of possible real spectra or families of real eigenvalues that can arise as a consequence of @xmath0-symmetry within the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "we review the general procedure of determining the regions of convergence in the complex plane and the energy eigenvalues within this approximation . +",
    "as indicated in the last section , our first task is to determine the regions in which the wave function converges in the complex @xmath55 plane , such as shown for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : x80 ] for @xmath44 . determining the regions of convergence does not require a detailed solution of the associated schrdinger equation - it is sufficient to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction as @xmath56 , where @xmath55 is regarded as a complex variable @xcite .",
    "within the wkb approximation , this limit is determined by the exponential controlling factor of the asymptotic wavefunction , @xmath57 to analyse in which regions of the complex plane this function converges to zero when @xmath56 , one determines the lines on which the wavefunction is purely oscillatory , i.e. where its real part vanishes .",
    "these stokes lines are thus found by evaluating eq .",

    "only one pair of these values lies @xmath0-symmetrically to one another .",
    "this pair , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , lies within the shaded areas of the diagramme , and is thus the only pair that can lead to a real spectrum via the wkb calculation .",
    "continuing in this fashion , when @xmath99 and @xmath100 , five possible turning points can be identified at angles @xmath101 .",
    "now two pairs are @xmath0-symmetric to one another , the pair @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the pair @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the first pair of turning points lies in the shaded region of the diagramme in fig .",
    "[ fig : picqm1 ] , while the second lies in the unshaded pair of wedges below the real axis .",
    "each of these pairs of turning points lying in each of these pairs of wedges gives rise to a wkb spectrum of real eigenvalues .",
    "for @xmath106 , this pattern continues , and seven turning points are identified ; these can be ordered into three pairs that lie @xmath0-symmetrically to one another and thus lead to three distinct real spectra , according to the wkb prescription .",
    "these results can be summarised into a heuristic prescription : by examining fig .",
    "[ fig : picqm1 ] , we note that for all of these cases , one pair of wedges in which the controlling factor of the asymptotic solution converges to zero includes the real axis and is @xmath0-symmetric , corresponding to the generation of one real spectrum .",

    "thus we note that the number of spectra that can form and that is actually determined by the number of @xmath0-symmetric pairs of turning points can be inferred from the convergence pattern of stokes wedges in the complex plane .",
    "the general rule is that this number corresponds to the number of noncontinguous @xmath0-symmetric pairs of stokes wedges .",

    "the stokes and anti - stokes lines can be easily determined and lead to the convergence patterns in the complex plane depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : picqm2 ] . in this figure , it is evident that a spectrum of real eigenvalues arises from conventional boundary conditions along the real axis , a feature expected from hamiltonians that are hermitian and bounded from below .",
    "this solution is the only one that can exist when @xmath115 .",
    "however , for higher values of @xmath10 further real spectra can develop by considering boundary conditions that are @xmath0-symmetric . for @xmath116 one additional pair of @xmath0-symmetric regions develops ( from turning points that fall within the shaded wedges below the real axis ) , while for @xmath117 , a pair of shaded wedges and a pair of unshaded wedges lie @xmath0-symmetrically to one another , leading to two further possible spectra of real eigenvalues .",
    "this result can be easily verified by evaluating the turning points in each case . for @xmath116 or @xmath118",
    ", there are 6 possible turning points , which group into three pairs of @xmath0-symmetric values .",
    "since the spectra resulting from the turning points in the upper half - plane ( in the @xmath0-symmetric shaded wedges ) are the same as those obtained from the turning points in the lower half - plane , only two distinct spectra are obtained .",
    "this reflection symmetry in the structure of the upper and lower half - planes is also evident for @xmath117 , for which the potential @xmath119 yields 5 pairs of @xmath0-symmetric turning points , lying in the @xmath0-symmetric stokes wedges shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : psihi ] ) to ( [ eq : antistokes ] ) .",
    "although this class of hamiltonians is hermitian , it is unbounded below .",

    ", it follows that these angles occur at @xcite @xmath182 and @xmath183 where @xmath184 is an integer .",
    "the controlling parts of the field - theoretical integrals - unlike their quantum - mechanical counterparts - do not converge to zero in _ all _ regions of the complex @xmath167 plane .",
    "the convergence patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : picft1 ] for the cases @xmath185 .",
    "each case has a convergent region along the real axis , yielding one real energy spectrum , or , for the ground state , the particle mass .",
    "in addition , however , the case @xmath186 develops further regions of convergence , which lie @xmath0-symmetrically to one another and thus generate a further spectrum leading to a further mass that has the ratio @xmath187 to the first mass . when @xmath53 , a second extra real energy spectrum develops , so that there are three in total , leading to masses lying in the ratio @xmath188 to one another .",
    "the region of convergence for @xmath189 strongly resembles the quantum - mechanical case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : picqm2 ] when @xmath115 .",
    "the fact that there is no convergent solution in the field - theoretic case in the vertical wedges does not play any role in determining the number of real spectra .",
    "these two cases are equivalent . for the case that @xmath186 , however , the distribution of stokes wedges shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : picft1 ] resembles the case @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig : picqm2 ] , but has one less available pair of @xmath0-symmetric wedges to construct a real spectrum .",
    "the quantum - mechanical case thus admits one more real spectrum than the field - theoretical case with a similar wedge structure .",
    "the number of real spectra in the field - theoretical case is given by @xmath190 .    for half - integer values of @xmath8 , such as @xmath191 or @xmath192 ,",
    "the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : picft2 ] emerges . for @xmath191 ,",
    "only one real energy spectrum can exist , while for @xmath192 an additional @xmath0-symmetrical spectrum can be found , with mass ratio @xmath193 between the two solutions .",
    "in general , for half - integer values of @xmath8 there are @xmath194 possible real spectra .     and @xmath195 .",
    "]    finally , we note that there are no @xmath0-symmetric solutions for values of @xmath196 corresponding to interactions of the form @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 respectively .",
    "this can be seen immediately on examining the pattern of stokes wedges for example , for @xmath200 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fi3 ] .    .",
    "in this paper , we have described the classification of families of ( positive ) real spectra associated with the quantum - mechanical hamiltonians @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath201 within the wkb approximation and for a scalar field theory @xmath202 within the functional integral formalism . in the quantum - mechanical case",
    ", we have shown that the number of real spectra depends on the number of pairs of @xmath0-symmetric turning points that can be found in the complex plane .",
    "this in turn depends on the type of hamiltonian and the form of the interaction potential .",
    "the classification of the number of @xmath0-symmetric turning points can be reinterpreted in terms of the position and number of stokes wedges in the complex plane , leading to the rule that each pair of noncontiguous @xmath0-symmetric stokes wedges may result in a positive energy spectrum containing real eigenvalues ; two pairs of stokes wedges which are symmetric to the real axis may however only be counted once .",
    "thus , by simply examining the stokes wedges in the complex plane , one can deduce the number of spectra of real eigenvalues that can occur .",
    "one recovers the usual result that dirac - hermitian hamiltonians have a spectrum of real eigenvalues due to `` normal '' boundary conditions placed along the real axis .",
    "however , these hamiltonians can give rise to additional real spectra if additional @xmath0-symmetrical regions of convergence exist in the complex plane .",
    "non - hermitian , but @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians can also possess a spectrum of real eigenvalues ( in fact several ) , while the class of dirac - hermitian hamiltonians that appear unbounded from below can also produce several such spectra or families .",
    "this is because the hamiltonians must always be solved together with a set of given boundary conditions . for all cases ,",
    "the spectra can be evaluated simply within the wkb approximation and the ratios of the different spectra can be found .",
    "a similar analysis of the scalar field theory using functional integrals shows that again the structure of the stokes wedges in the complex plane suffices to give information on the number of possible real spectra .",
    "however , fewer real spectra are available in cases which appear formally similar to their quantum - mechanical counterparts , as the regions of convergence of the asymptotic controlling factor in the complex plane are restricted by the sign of the power of the action , as it occurs in the generating functional . the ratio of the masses ( ground state energies ) of the individual spectra can also be simply evaluated . here",
    "the approximation lies in the truncation of the dyson - schwinger equations .    finally , it is appropriate to stress the limitations of the analysis given here . in the quantum - mechanical cases ,",
    "it is unclear how well the wkb approximation reproduces the actual energy eigenvalues , which can only be calculated definitively numerically .",
    "usually the result is excellent for the lowest states , see @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not possible to use it to describe the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0-symmetry , and the associated phase transition .",
    "nor can it be used to address deeper questions such as whether a particular spectrum has a finite or infinite number of real eigenvalues .",
    "more powerful techniques are needed .",
    "some useful references that go beyond the wkb approach can be found for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work has been performed at the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics , germany , to which we are grateful .",
