    "the first motivation for supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) stems from the solution of the naturalness or fine tuning problem in the higgs sector of the sm @xcite ( besides the unification of the gauge couplings and the possibility to explain dark matter ) : in the sm with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath6 much larger than the electroweak scale @xmath7 , the bare higgs mass squared @xmath8 must satisfy roughly @xmath9",
    ". hence @xmath8 must be of the order @xmath10 , but must be finetuned relative to @xmath10 with a precision of the order @xmath11 .",
    "this fine tuning is enormous for @xmath6 of the order of a gut scale , but only a tuning of @xmath12 is considered as natural . within supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm with susy breaking terms of the order @xmath13 , the necessary tuning between the parameters is of the order of @xmath14 , and hence independent from an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath6 .",
    "first results of searches for susy by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc , based on @xmath15  fb@xmath16 of data taken at 7  tev center - of - mass energy , imply lower bounds on susy breaking gluino and up / down squark masses in the 1  tev range @xcite ( for the latest publications , see the atlas and cms notes on the web pages @xcite ) .",
    "these bounds reduce the phenomenologically viable range of parameters in susy extensions of the sm . however , an obviously interesting question is the impact of these negative results on the necessary tuning between the parameters in the remaining parameter region .",
    "it is well known that the non - observation of a higgs boson at lep @xcite implies already a `` little fine tuning problem '' in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the field content in the higgs sector is as small as possible , but large radiative corrections are required in order to lift the mass of the lightest neutral cp - even higgs boson above the lower lep bound .",
    "large radiative corrections require relatively large susy breaking top squark masses compared to the electroweak scale . via loop diagrams ,",
    "large top squark masses lead to relatively large soft susy breaking higgs mass terms , which require some tuning among the parameters of the mssm such that the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) are of @xmath17 , well below the scale of the higgs mass terms .",
    "the required tuning among the parameters of the mssm is typically of the order of a few  % .",
    "the `` little fine tuning problem '' of the mssm , originating from lep constraints , is alleviated in certain regions of the parameter space of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "the nmssm is the simplest susy extension of the sm with a scale invariant superpotential , i.e. where the only dimensionful parameters are the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "no supersymmetric higgs mass term @xmath18 is required as in the mssm , since it is generated dynamically by the vacuum expectation value of a gauge singlet superfield  @xmath19 ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "together with the neutral components of the two su(2 ) doublet higgs fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the mssm , one finds three neutral cp - even and two cp - odd higgs states in this model .",
    "the additional coupling @xmath22 of @xmath19 to @xmath20 and @xmath21 can lead to a larger mass @xmath23 of the sm - like neutral higgs boson @xmath24 , and to mixings of the physical cp - even higgs bosons in terms of the weak eigenstates @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , implying reduced couplings of the physical eigenstates to the @xmath25 boson . both phenomena make it easier to satisfy the lep bounds @xcite , and allow to alleviate the little finetuning problem @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for an evaluation of the upper bound on @xmath23 of about 140  gev if @xmath22 is required to remain perturbative below the gut scale ; if @xmath22 is allowed to be larger , @xmath23 can be even larger @xcite . )",
    "moreover , @xmath24 can decay preferably into lighter nmssm - specific singlet - like higgs bosons . in this case",
    "lep bounds on @xmath23 are lower , and again the required fine tuning can be considerably smaller than in the mssm @xcite .",
    "consequently it becomes important to study the impact of the recent bounds from the lhc on the fine tuning within the nmssm , which is the purpose of this paper .",
    "the most frequently used quantitative measure @xmath26 for fine tuning is the maximum of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath7 with respect to all fundamental parameters @xmath27 ( if the fundamental lagrangian is given at the gut scale ) @xcite : [ eq:1 ] = max\\{_i^ } , _ i^ = || .",
    "( see @xcite for alternatives ; sometimes @xmath28 instead of @xmath7 is used in the argument of the logarithm , which leads to an obvious additional factor of 2 .",
    "subsequently we prefer to study linear relations between all masses and couplings . )",
    "@xmath26 depends on the point in parameter space and is , roughly speaking , inversely proportional to the required fine tuning ( as discussed above ) between the parameters @xmath27 .",
    "hence , for a given point in parameter space , @xmath26 should be as small as possible , preferably of @xmath29 .",
    "preferred regions in the parameter space spanned by @xmath27 are those where @xmath26 is minimal ( denoted by @xmath30 ) . in practice , the value of @xmath26 depends on the choice of independent fundamental parameters defining the model , and on the implementation of phenomenological constraints as the dark matter relic density , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon etc ..    including wmap constraints on the dark matter relic density ( but leaving aside the top yukawa coupling @xmath31 in the list of @xmath27 ) , @xmath26 has been studied recently within the constrained mssm ( cmssm , with universal soft susy breaking terms at the gut scale ) in @xcite .",
    "first investigations of the impact of the early lhc results on the susy parameter space in the cmssm have been performed in @xcite , in the cmssm with non - universal sfermion masses in @xcite , and within the general mssm in @xcite .",
    "compared to alternative procedures as likelihood scans and/or bayesian techniques ( see @xcite for studies within constrained versions of the nmssm , and @xcite for a recent discussion ) a disadvantage of @xmath26 is that it does not allow to marginalise ( i.e. to integrate over ) parts of the parameters which , in turn , would allow to determine `` most likely '' values for given quantities as masses of specific particles , given all present experimental constraints .",
    "( clearly , such predictions for `` most likely '' masses seem to be of limited use ; for instance , they would have failed miserably if applied to the sm - like higgs mass in the pre - lep era . )",
    "one can also leave aside the issue of quantitative fine tuning , content oneself with the fact that the fine tuning in susy is always much smaller than in the sm with a large cutoff @xmath6 , and determine `` most likely '' values for parameters exclusively from best fits to data from electroweak precision experiments .",
    "the impact of recent lhc bounds on such best fits has been studied recently in @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the constraints from recent or future lhc results on the quantitative fine tuning measure @xmath26 can contribute to the discussion on the impact of lhc results on supersymmetry in general .",
    "hence we will compare these constraints within the parameter space of the semi - constrained snmssm ( where singlet - specific soft terms are allowed to be non - universal ) to the cmssm , obtained from the snmssm in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we study the dependence of @xmath26 on the universal soft susy breaking parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( gaugino and scalar masses , respectively ) and on the gluino and up / down squark masses .",
    "in particular we investigate the relevance of nmssm specific scenarios in the higgs sector for fine tuning , as scenarios with large singlet / doublet mixing and scenarios with dominant @xmath33 decays @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we define the model , the procedure for the determination of @xmath26 , and discuss some specific properties of @xmath26 in the nmssm .",
    "our results and their discussion are given in section  3 , and we conclude with a summary in section  4 .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm by the presence of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath19 .",
    "the higgs mass term @xmath34 in the superpotential @xmath35 of the mssm is replaced by the coupling @xmath36 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to @xmath19 and a self - coupling @xmath37 , hence the superpotential @xmath38 is scale invariant in this simplest @xmath39-invariant version of the nmssm : [ eq:2 ] w_nmssm = s h_uh_d + s^3 + h_t h_uq t^c_r + h_b h_dq b^c_r + h_h_d l ^c_r , where we have confined ourselves to the yukawa couplings of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the quarks and leptons @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the third generation ; a sum over the three generations is implicitly assumed .",

    "<S> we discuss the dependence of the fine tuning on the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and on the higgs masses in nmssm specific scenarios involving large singlet - doublet higgs mixing or dominant higgs - to - higgs decays . whereas these latter scenarios allow _ a priori _ for considerably less fine tuning than the constrained mssm , the early lhc results rule out a large part of the parameter space of the semi - constrained nmssm corresponding to low values of the fine tuning .    </S>",
