    "supermassive black hole binaries formed from galactic mergers can coalesce if angular momentum loss  initially to stars and gas and subsequently via gravitational radiation @xcite  is fast enough to conclude the process within at most a hubble time , or more stringently before a subsequent merger creates a 3-body system that is unstable to a black hole ejection @xcite . due to the formation of a loss cone , stars on their own are likely to fail to meet this requirement for binary separations of the order of @xmath2  pc and binary masses @xmath3 @xcite , parameters which today are characteristic of massive ( @xmath4 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "for this subset of galaxies , angular momentum loss to gas provides a plausible mechanism that can yield a prompt merger @xcite . at lower masses , stellar dynamic processes",
    "are in principle sufficient to effect mergers , but gas may still be involved if disks are present and remove angular momentum efficiently on a time scale significantly shorter than stellar interactions .",

    "following merger @xcite are likely to change the direction of any jets launched from the immediate vicinity of the black hole @xcite .",
    "such counterparts are of interest , in part , because their detection in coincidence with lisa events would overcome lisa s limited capability to spatially localize signals , and pin down the galaxy within which a merger had occurred .",
    "unambiguous identification of merger sites significantly enhances the potential cosmological utility of merger events @xcite , and substantially improves the ability of lisa to trace the growth of black holes as a function of galactic environment and morphology .    in this paper",
    ", we study the evolution of binary eccentricity in the event that angular momentum loss to gas dominates the inspiral immediately prior to the onset of rapid shrinkage via gravitational radiation . in ",
    "2 we show that the gravitational interaction between the binary and a surrounding gas disk is likely to excite black hole binaries to eccentricities @xmath5 , a result anticipated from both analytic studies @xcite , simulations of pre - main sequence binary stars @xcite , and simulations of massive disk - embedded planets @xcite . in  3 we argue that although gravitational radiation will damp these eccentricities prior to coalescence , the transition between disk - driven and gravitational wave - driven inspiral can occur at small enough radii that a small but significant eccentricity survives when the separation is only tens of gravitational radii .",
    "detection of this eccentricity in the gravitational wave signal would provide strong circumstantial evidence for the role of gas in driving mergers , even in the absence of other electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "if gas is the causative angular momentum loss process of supermassive black hole binary coalescences , the merger is expected to proceed through two phases . in the initial phase ,",
    "the binary is either surrounded by @xcite or completely embedded within @xcite circumbinary gas . if the gas mass is not too large , and the gas temperature ( relative to the virial temperature at the radius of the binary ) not too high , gravitational torques @xcite from the binary act to clear a gap in the circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the inner truncation radius of this gap depends upon the binary mass ratio , disk properties , and eccentricity . for small eccentricity truncation",
    "occurs at around @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the binary semi - major axis @xcite .",
    "the binary , and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , shrink as angular momentum is transfered from the orbital angular momentum of the black holes into the gas .",
    "this phase is qualitatively similar to the type  ii migration ( i.e. involving a gap ) of massive planets , with the major difference being that a close black hole binary interacts with a relatively smaller mass of disk gas than a typical massive planet .",
    "the mismatch between the disk mass and the binary mass slows the rate of both gas inflow and orbital decay .",
    "the first phase ends when angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation  which on its own drives decay of the semi - major axis @xmath7 at a rate @xmath8",
    " first exceeds that due to circumbinary disk torques .",
    "the binary then enters a second phase in which gravitational wave losses control the rate of inspiral .",
    "initially , the circumbinary gas , although now dynamically unimportant , flows inward fast enough to remain in contact with the tidal barrier created by the binary . any initial eccentricity excited during",
    "the first phase will start to damp .",
    "eventually , however , the decay of the binary separation becomes too fast , and the binary detaches from the circumbinary gas , which through coalescence remains approximately frozen in the configuration it had at the moment of detachment .",
    "any low density gas remaining within the central cavity during this final stage is expected to have little influence on the binary orbital elements @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the interaction between a binary and surrounding circumbinary gas disk using the zeus code @xcite .",
    "we work in 2-dimensional cylindrical co - ordinates @xmath9 , with ` scaled gridding ' in the radial direction ( i.e. @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a constant , so that computational zones have the same shape at all radii ) and a standard resolution of @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the computational domain extends from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with @xmath14 chosen to lie interior to the expected inner truncation radius of the circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "we exclude the region close to the black holes , and do not attempt to model the gas flow or torques arising from the smaller disks around each black hole .",

    "we refer to these as the ` hot ' , ` warm ' and ` cold ' disk models respectively .    at the relatively small radii we are most interested in ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the schwarzschild radius ) , angular momentum transport within the circumbinary disk probably arises from turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite , which can not be simulated in two dimensions .",
    "instead we model angular momentum transport within the disk using a constant kinematic viscosity @xmath29 , which operates on the azimuthal component of the momentum equation only @xcite .",
    "there is no reason to think that this , or any other simple viscosity prescription , reproduces accurately the multi - dimensional effects of angular momentum transport from mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "we adopt it purely for numerical simplicity .",

    "consistent with the choice of a constant viscosity , we set the disk surface density @xmath33 to be uniform in the initial state , so that the initial accretion rate @xmath34 is constant with radius . the disk models with varying @xmath16 are set up with the same initial surface density .",
    "the dynamics of the binary , including forces from the circumbinary gas , are integrated using a simple second - order scheme that is adequate for the relatively short duration ( @xmath35 orbits ) of our simulations . over these time scales ,",
    "realistic surface densities of the circumbinary disk are small enough that they would lead to negligible changes in the binary semi - major axis @xmath7 and eccentricity @xmath36 .",
    "for example , a steady - state shakura - sunyaev disk @xcite around a black hole of mass @xmath37 , accreting at the eddington limit with @xmath38 , has a surface density at @xmath39 of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the mass in the region of the disk that interacts with the binary is only a very small fraction of the binary mass , and evolution is slow . in order to see significant evolution within of the order of @xmath41 orbits ,",
    "we therefore need to adopt a higher scaling for the surface density",
    ". however , this _ does not _ affect the rate of eccentricity growth ( or damping ) , measured as @xmath42 , because the perturbing accelerations that alter @xmath7 and @xmath36 are linear in the disk mass ( this is evident explicitly in gauss equations , given in simplified form as equations ( 1)-(3 ) of artymowicz et al .",
    "1991 ) . choosing",
    "a higher surface density scaling therefore accelerates the time scale for changes in both @xmath7 and @xmath36 by the same factor .",
    "large disk masses do lead to some wandering of the binary as the eccentricity grows  we suppress this and maintain the binary center of mass at @xmath43 throughout the runs .    the initial conditions are set up as a uniform disk in keplerian rotation ( including the correction due to the pressure gradient ) outside @xmath32 , where @xmath7 is the initial binary separation . inside @xmath6",
    ", we exponentially truncate the surface density .",
    "for the hot disk run , we evolve the disk for 40 binary orbits before turning on ( smoothly over an additional 5 orbits ) the backreaction from the disk in the binary integration . for the cooler disks ,",
    "we start with the initial conditions for the hot disk and linearly reduce the sound speed over the first 25 orbits of the calculation until it reaches its final , fixed value .",
    "these procedures are intended to minimize _ dynamical time scale _ transients created as the initially uniform disk adjusts to the non - axisymmetric forcing from the binary .",
    "the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , for example , is able to adjust its position in response to the forcing on such a short time scale . considering longer time scales , however , the initial disk surface density profile  which corresponds to a steady - state solution around a single central mass  is not in equilibrium . over a viscous time scale , gas",
    "whose inflow is impeded by tidal forces from the binary would accumulate near the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , increasing the surface density . over the duration of our simulations ,",
    "this effect is small but noticeable .",
    "it is not present for the hottest disk , which is able to overflow the gap toward the individual binary components most easily .",
    "[ fig_image ]    figure  1 shows a map of the surface density at @xmath44  orbits for the hot disk , which surrounds a binary with mass ratio @xmath45 , initial semi - major axis @xmath46 , and initial eccentricity @xmath47 . the computational domain extended from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "torques from the binary truncate the inner edge of the circumbinary disk at around @xmath6 , although there is significant overflow across the gap @xcite and through the inner boundary of the simulated disk .",
    "the cooler disk runs are qualitatively similar , although the thickness of the spiral arms and the extent of mass overflow both decrease as the disk becomes thinner .",
    "[ fig_growth ]    figure  2 shows the evolution of @xmath7 and @xmath36 for binaries embedded within the cold , warm , and hot disks .",
    "once the backreaction forces from the disk are turned on after the initial equilibration period , the eccentricity grows and the orbit decays in all three cases . as expected , the rate of orbital decay is fastest for the hottest , most viscous disk model , while eccentricity grows most rapidly for the coldest disk .",
    "this is consistent with the analytic expectation that eccentricity growth is driven by resonant interaction with gas at relatively large distance from the binary .",
    "for all three of our disk models , we find that the inner edge of the disk at the end of the equilibration period remains close to @xmath50 .",
    "the dominant active resonance is then the 1:3 outer eccentric lindblad resonance at @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of this resonance is increased for cold disks , in which the inner evacuated cavity is better defined .",
    "for the cold disk model , although we are unable to determine the saturation value of the eccentricity , we find that @xmath36 increases to more than @xmath52 before the binary has shrunk by more than a few percent in semi - major axis .",
    "[ fig_deda ]    figure  3 shows the evolution of binary orbital elements in the @xmath7-@xmath36 plane , which for the reasons noted above is independent of the arbitrary choice of disk surface density . for the cold disk",
    "we find that the eccentricity grows at a relatively constant rate , @xmath53 up to @xmath54 , with the growth rate modestly decreasing as the eccentricity increases further .",
    "any significant orbital migration within such a disk would therefore be expected to yield significant eccentricities .",
    "growth rates are substantially lower in the warm ( @xmath55 ) and cold ( @xmath56 ) disks .",

    ", we expect the disk interaction to shrink the binary orbit at a rate , @xmath60 this is just the viscous inflow velocity of gas in the disk , reduced by the ratio of the local disk mass to the secondary mass .",
    "we note that this expression does not include changes to the equilibrium disk structure that occur over a viscous time scale @xcite",
    ". viscous time scale equilibrium , which is not achieved in our simulations , is discussed more thoroughly in  3 .",
    "the rate of change of eccentricity is expected to scale as @xcite , @xmath61 comparing these expressions we expect eccentricity growth to be most rapid for nearly equal mass ratio binaries in geometrically thin and / or relatively inviscid disks .",
    "our simulations are similar in spirit to those of @xcite and @xcite . using smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations , @xcite derived an eccentricity growth rate @xmath62 for a binary with a mass ratio of @xmath63 and @xmath52 , embedded within a disk in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this disk is modestly colder than our ` cold ' case .",
    "their growth rate , shown as an arrow in figure  3 , is approximately a factor of two greater than obtained in our ` cold ' simulation .",
    "our smaller growth rate is consistent with a trend toward faster growth in geometrically thinner disks .    motivated by the surprisingly large eccentricities of many massive extrasolar planets , more recent numerical work on binary - disk interactions",
    "has focused on extreme mass ratio ( @xmath66 ) systems . in a disk model intended to represent a typical protoplanetary disk ,",
    "@xcite obtained eccentricity growth for mass ratios @xmath67 , while damping occurred for more extreme mass ratios .",
    "eccentricities as large as @xmath68 were obtained in these simulations .",
    "subsequent analytic work @xcite has identified circumstances in which the critical mass ratio for eccentricity growth might be reduced still further  perhaps to values of @xmath69  but this has yet to be confirmed numerically . in the black hole binary problem , these subtleties are probably moot .",
    "extreme mass ratios are unlikely to occur as a consequence of galactic mergers @xcite , because the dynamical friction time scale for the smaller black hole to reach the galactic center would exceed the hubble time .",
    "extreme mass ratio binaries are however conceivable if intermediate mass black holes @xcite form within the nucleus and are subsequently captured by the gas disk .",
    "our simulations commence with finite eccentricity , which is then unstable to subsequent growth .",
    "the physical origin of such a seed eccentricity is speculative , although there are enough possibilities that we think it unlikely that a binary could evade the instability by remaining perfectly circular .",
    "first , the endpoint of the prior stage of stellar dynamical hardening might leave the binary with non - zero eccentricity , although the results of @xcite suggest that any such eccentricity would be small .",
    "second , the binary could acquire eccentricity while embedded within the disk , for example via a kozai resonance with a misaligned gas or stellar disk at larger radius in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "finally , non - axisymmetry in the disk itself  due to self - gravity at large radii @xcite , eccentric instabilities in individual circumstellar disks @xcite , or instabilities at the edge of the circumbinary disk @xcite  appears to be almost unavoidable .",
    "such non - axisymmetry in the disk is readily exchanged into the binary @xcite , and , if it is large enough , could serve as the initial seed for subsequent growth .",
    "any eccentricity attained by the binary during the phase of gas - driven orbital decay will be damped during the final stage of gravitational wave - driven inspiral .",
    "the extent of the damping depends upon the separation of the binary ( in gravitational radii ) at the time when decoupling from the gas occurs . to gain a rough idea of the magnitude of the damping",
    ", we initially consider a toy model in which the binary decouples instantaneously from the disk at a radius @xmath70 , which for now we regard as a free parameter . for @xmath71 ,",

    "the formulae apply in the weak field limit , which is appropriate provided that we do not consider times _ extremely _ close to the instant of coalescence ( note that at one week before coalescence , the separation is still @xmath76 ) . in the strong field regime",
    ", @xmath36 tends to increase in anticipation of the final ` plunge ' @xcite .",
    "[ fig_damp ]    figure  4 shows the predicted binary eccentricity at one week and one year before coalescence for different @xmath75 , as a function of the decoupling radius @xmath70 .",
    "an initial eccentricity @xmath77 was assumed , which seems reasonable given our simulations and previous work @xcite .",
    "binaries observed through coalescence with lisa are predicted to have a mass ratio distribution that peaks around @xmath78 .",
    "if these binaries in fact have a gas - driven inspiral phase , decoupling within @xmath79 gravitational radii typically yields a final eccentricity of @xmath80 . at fixed @xmath70 , binaries with more extreme mass ratios yield smaller final values of the eccentricity , reflecting the fact that at a given time prior to coalescence the separation of @xmath66 systems is smaller than for the @xmath81 case .",
    "to go further , we need to estimate how @xmath70 depends upon the binary and disk parameters .",
    "we begin by noting that , in the absence of a binary , gas in an accretion disk flows inward at a rate given by the viscous inflow speed , @xmath82 the separation of a circular binary shrinking under the influence of gravitational radiation decays at a rate , @xmath83 equating these expressions determines a _ detachment _ radius , defined via @xmath84 .",
    "the detachment radius is the smallest radius for which the inflowing gas can ` keep up ' with the shrinkage of the binary .",
    "interior to this radius , the binary orbit continues to contract within a growing hole while the circumbinary gas remains essentially frozen @xcite .",
    "the detachment radius is typically quite small .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate that the shrinking binary leaves a hole of size @xmath85 , which lies well within the innermost , radiation pressure dominated disk .    for dynamical purposes we are more interested in the decoupling radius @xmath70 ",
    "within which the rate of angular momentum loss to gravitational waves exceeds that due to interaction with the circumbinary disk . to calculate this we need to set @xmath86 equal to the disk - driven inspiral velocity @xmath87 .",
    "the inspiral velocity equals the viscous inflow speed in the limit where the secondary black hole is of low enough mass that it can be treated as a test particle within the disk .",
    "if the unperturbed disk surface density at the orbital radius @xmath88 of the secondary is @xmath89 , test particle behavior will occur for @xmath90 . for more massive secondaries ,",
    "the large reservoir of binary angular momentum reduces the inspiral velocity to a fraction of the viscous inflow speed .",
    "the binary then acts as a slowly moving dam which impedes the free inflow of gas .    for black hole binaries",
    "the massive secondary limit is the relevant one for small enough separations . to estimate the inspiral velocity in this regime , we apply the analysis of @xcite . for a disk",
    "in which the unperturbed surface density at radius @xmath88 is @xmath89 , @xcite define a measure of disk dominance , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the secondary mass . then if the unperturbed disk solution can be locally written as , @xmath93 with @xmath94 , the inspiral velocity is , @xmath95 the correction factor in the last equation accounts for the slowdown in orbital decay when the secondary is massive compared to the local disk .",
    "the slowdown is usually less than the full factor of @xmath96 , because gas accumulates just outside the slowly moving tidal barrier created by the binary .",
    "this pile - up increases the torque relative to that obtained from an unperturbed disk solution @xcite .",
    "the above equations allow us to calculate the decoupling radius for a binary given an estimate for @xmath97 and a model for the accretion disk structure . here",
    ", we adopt the simplest shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) model .",
    "we normalize the accretion rate to the eddington limiting value , @xmath98 and measure the mass @xmath99 in solar units .",
    "then in the inner , radiation pressure - dominated disk , away from the inner boundary @xcite , @xmath100 whereas at larger radii , where gas pressure dominates and the opacity is due to electron scattering , @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the schwarzschild radius , and the transition between the two regimes occurs at , @xmath103 these relations allow us to calculate @xmath104 in both the radiation pressure and gas pressure dominated regions of the disk . in the gas pressure dominated middle disk we can also directly estimate @xmath87 . in this region @xmath105 in equation  ( [ eq_a ] ) is 0.6 , so the slowdown in the inspiral velocity when the secondary is massive scales as @xmath106 . for representative disk and binary parameters ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 )",
    "we find that the disk drives inspiral at a rate reduced from the viscous rate by about a factor of 50 .",
    "we can not use the same formula to calculate the slowdown in the radiation pressure dominated inner disk , since in this region @xmath111 . for an estimate",
    ", we simply continue to use the slowdown factor derived for the middle disk in this region .",
    "we note that the structure of accretion disks in the innermost radiation - dominated regime remains subject to large uncertainties @xcite , so any statements about this region are at best semi - quantitative .",
    "[ fig_eccentric ]    the solid curves in figure  5 show our best estimates for the estimated eccentricity at one week and one year prior to coalescence .",
    "we take @xmath112 , @xmath110 , and consider binaries of varying @xmath75 but fixed total mass @xmath113 .",
    "calculations suggest that lisa should detect a significant number of mergers in which the black holes have masses in this range @xcite , whereas events involving more massive holes ( @xmath114 ) will be rare .",
    "as previously , we assume that @xmath77 at the epoch when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant angular momentum loss mechanism and the binary decouples from the gas . with these assumptions",
    ", we find that for roughly equal mass binaries @xmath115 at one week before coalescence , while a year earlier @xmath116 .",
    "higher terminal eccentricities are predicted for more extreme mass ratios , first because gravitational radiation is relatively less efficient , and second because the slowdown in disk driven inflow at small radii is smaller for a less massive secondary ( equation  [ eq_slowdown ] ) . the eccentricity at one year before coalescence could exceed @xmath52 for @xmath117 .",
    "we also note that there is a substantial separation between the decoupling radius  when the gas ceases to be dynamically important for the evolution of the binary  and the detachment radius when the gas and the binary become physically separated .    with these parameters the derived decoupling radius @xmath70 moves from modestly interior to @xmath118 ( for @xmath81 ) , to well inside the radiation pressure dominated disk ( for @xmath66 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in calculating @xmath87 in this region therefore have a direct impact on the derived values of @xmath70 , and on the final estimated eccentricity .",
    "cognizant of this , we also plot in figure  5 a more robust lower limit to the final eccentricity , derived under the simple assumption that the disk dominates the loss of angular momentum up to the point where it becomes radiation pressure dominated .",
    "we assume an unperturbed disk structure when determining this radius ( equation  [ eq_transition ] ) , so there is no dependence on @xmath75 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the resulting lower limit is approximately @xmath120 at one year before coalescence , and @xmath121 at one week before coalescence .",
    "since the decoupling radius for this calculation is fixed , the trend is for smaller final eccentricity for lower @xmath75 ( e.g. figure  4 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that observation of the gravitational waves from merging black hole binaries could provide circumstantial evidence of the uncertain astrophysical processes that ( probably ) allow supermassive black hole binaries to coalesce .",
    "specifically , we suggest that a small but non - zero eccentricity would signal that angular momentum loss to gas was the dominant decay process immediately preceding the final gravitational wave - driven inspiral . if , alternatively , interaction with stars precedes the final inspiral , the final eccentricity is likely to be very small .",
    "most studies suggest that orbital decay via stellar dynamical processes is accompanied by circularization @xcite , although @xcite has reported eccentricity growth in some recent n - body simulations .    in the case of gas - driven mergers",
    ", eccentricity growth appears to be a robust prediction of simulations @xcite provided that ( a ) the mass ratio is not _ very _ extreme ( @xmath122 appears to be safely in the ` growth ' regime ) , and ( b ) the surrounding gas is not so hot and dense as to completely swamp the binary and thereby fill in the gap whose existence is necessary for eccentricity growth @xcite .",
    "one caveat is that existing simulations do not treat the angular momentum transport within the disk from first principles , and it is possible that this omission might alter the conditions needed for eccentricity growth .",
    "direct simulations of binaries embedded within mhd turbulent disks are computationally possible ( although still difficult ) only in the gas pressure dominated regime @xcite , and would be valuable .",
    "there is even more uncertainty as to how the binary interacts with a radiation pressure dominated disk .",
    "the presence of significant eccentricity for black hole binaries close to merger has additional consequences that are potentially observable . as noted by @xcite both in general , and for the specific case of the quasar oj  287 , accretion from the circumbinary disk on to the individual disks around the holes",
    "is strongly time - variable if the binary is eccentric .",
    "the time scales can be interesting even when the binary is still far from coalescence .",
    "for example , a circumbinary disk surrounding a binary with @xmath113 and @xmath123 would remain gas pressure dominated until the separation was less than @xmath124 , at which point we would predict the disk torque to dominate and the eccentricity to be significant .",
    "the inspiral time for these parameters is of the order of @xmath125  yr , but the orbital time scale is still small  approximately 1  month .",
    "this is also the time scale on which the individual disks might be expected to vary . if gas is responsible for merging a large fraction of supermassive black hole binaries , such systems , because they are that much further away from merger , must be much more numerous than galaxies that will host lisa events .",
    "although still rare , they might be identified via their characteristic x - ray variability .",
    "the eccentricity is one of the intrinsic parameters of merging black holes that can be measured via detection of the gravitational wave emission , potentially to high accuracy . as an illustration , for a _ stellar mass _ black hole merging with a @xmath37 supermassive black hole from an orbit with @xmath52",
    ", lisa may achieve an accuracy of @xmath126 for an event with signal - to - noise ratio of 30 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss how lisa measurements of the eccentricity of compact objects merging with supermassive black holes can be used to distinguish between different capture mechanisms .",
