    "it has long been appreciated that there exists a dark - matter problem in that the nonrelativistic matter fraction @xmath1 of critical density , inferred from galactic rotation curves , cluster stability , and peculiar velocities , far exceeds the ordinary baryonic matter fraction @xmath2 provided by nucleosynthesis , but falls short of the standard inflationary prediction of unity @xcite .",
    "observations of high - redshift supernova @xcite and microwave background anisotropies @xcite have now settled the case for a flat universe with the dominant component dubbed ` dark energy ' possessing appreciable negative pressure , such that the ratio @xmath3 is less than @xmath4 .",
    "the most conservative reading of the wmap results @xcite is that @xmath5 is provided by traditional cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates , while the balance resides in a cosmological constant @xmath6 with the corresponding density fraction @xmath7 .",
    "the inherent fine - tuning and coincidence problems of the @xmath6cdm model are somewhat ameliorated in quintessence models @xcite , which replace @xmath6 by an evolving scalar field .",
    "however , like its predecessor , a quintessence - cdm model assumes that dark matter and dark energy are distinct entities .",
    "for a recent review on the most popular dark - matter and dark - energy models , see @xcite .",
    "a more liberal interpretation is that these data may tell us something profound about the space - time we inhabit , dark matter / energy being different manifestations of a common structure encoded in the dark sector s",
    "@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility becomes evident upon recalling that the average density in a virialized halo is more than several hundred times higher than the critical density , suggesting a density dependent @xmath9 with @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 for @xmath13 and the identification of `` dark matter '' with objects which became nonlinear at high redshift .",
    "the general class of models in which a unification of dark matter and dark energy is achieved through a single entity is often referred to as _ quartessence _ @xcite . among other scenarios of unification that have recently been suggested ,",
    "interesting attempts are based on the so - called _ k - essence _",
    "@xcite , a scalar field with noncanonical kinetic terms which was first introduced as a model for inflation @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest scenario in which dark matter and dark energy are different manifestations of a single substance may be realized through the chaplygin gas , an exotic fluid obeying @xmath14 which has been extensively studied for its mathematical properties @xcite . the cosmological potential of equation ( [ eq001 ] ) was first noted by kamenshchik _",
    "et al _ @xcite who observed that integrating the energy conservation equation in a homogeneous model led to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale factor normalized to unity today and @xmath17 an integration constant .",
    "thus , the chaplygin gas interpolates between matter , @xmath18 , at high redshift and a cosmological constant like @xmath19 as @xmath16 tends to infinity .    of particular interest",
    "is that equation ( [ eq001 ] ) is obtained @xcite from the lagrangian @xmath20 which may be seen by evaluating the stress - energy tensor @xmath21 and introducing @xmath22 for the four - velocity and @xmath23 for the energy density .",
    "one recognizes @xmath24 as a lagrangian of the born - infeld type familiar in the @xmath25-brane constructions of string/@xmath26 theory @xcite .",
    "geometrically , @xmath24 describes space - time as a 3 + 1 brane in a 4 + 1 bulk via the embedding coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "the same lagrangian appears as the leading term in sundrum s @xcite effective field theory approach to large extra dimensions ; for one such extra dimension , @xmath28 , lowering the planck scale to the intermediate scale of about 10@xmath29 gev , one estimates @xmath30 @xmath31 mev @xcite .",
    "the born - infeld lagrangian ( [ eq003 ] ) is a special case of the string - theory inspired tachyon lagrangian @xcite in which the constant @xmath32 is replaced by a potential @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately , tachyon models encounter the problem that , generically , @xmath34 is a maximum , so the tachyon field rolls quickly towards the minimum @xmath35 thereby driving @xmath36 to leave only a dust component @xcite .",
    "however , the situation may be quite different in inhomogeneous tachyon cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is possible to define a ` generalized chaplygin gas ' @xcite through @xmath37 where @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", the analogue of equation ( [ eq003 ] ) lacks any geometrical interpretation , but equation ( [ eq104 ] ) can be obtained from a moving brane in schwarzschild - anti - de - sitter bulk @xcite . in the limit @xmath39 ,",
    "one approaches a model equivalent to @xmath6cdm in the background equations , although the perturbation equations yield a different power spectrum @xcite .",
    "all models that unify dark matter and dark energy face the problem of nonvanishing sound speed and the well - known jeans instability . a fluid with a nonzero sound speed",
    "has a characteristic scale below which the pressure effectively opposes gravity .",
    "hence the perturbations of the scale smaller than the sonic horizon will be prevented from growing . in the chaplygin - gas model ,",
    "the sound speed is small at early times but is significant at the crossover region and hence the small scale perturbations are dumped .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated that the purely perturbative chaplygin - gas model @xcite is in severe conflict with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) angular power spectrum @xcite and the mass power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been pointed out that if nonadiabatic perturbations are allowed , the chaplygin - gas model may be compatible with the 2df mass power spectrum @xcite .    a more general situation where the chaplygin gas is mixed with cdm is considered in a number of papers @xcite . in this case",
    ", the chaplygin gas simply plays the role of dark energy . in keeping with the quartessence philosophy it would be preferred if cold dark matter could be replaced by droplets of chaplygin condensate .",
    "homogeneous world models containing a mixture of cold dark matter and chaplygin gas have been successfully confronted with lensing statistics @xcite as well as with supernova and other tests @xcite .",
    "bean and dor @xcite and similarly amendola _",
    "et al _ @xcite have examined a mixture of cdm and the generalized chaplygin gas against supernova , large - scale structure , and cmb constraints and demonstrated that a thorough likelihood analysis favors the limit @xmath40 , i.e. , the equivalent @xmath6cdm model . in both papers",
    "it has been concluded that the standard chaplygin gas is ruled out as a candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , a recent analysis @xcite of the supernova data seems to indicate that the generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath41 is favored over the @xmath39 model .    in spite of these somewhat discouraging results",
    "we share the opinion of gorini _ et al _ @xcite that the chaplygin gas still deserves further investigation and that a thorough investigation of the nonlinear regime of the growth of inhomogeneities is needed for a definite conclusion concerning the compatibility of the chaplygin gas cosmologies with the observable large - scale structure of the universe . on the basis of an extended spherical model which includes the sonic horizon effects , in this paper",
    "we show that a fraction of the chaplygin gas condensates and never reaches a stage where its properties change from dark - matter - like to dark - energy - like . hence",
    ", at the crossover region a fraction of the gas behaves effectively as dark matter and the rest as dark energy .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the nonlinear evolution of perturbation in the newtonian limit by generalizing the spherical model .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section 3 .",
    "to be able to claim that the chaplygin gas ( or any other candidate ) actually achieves unification , one must be assured that initial perturbations can evolve into a deeply nonlinear regime to form a gravitational condensate of superparticles that can play the role of cold dark matter . in @xcite this was inferred on the basis of the zeldovich approximation @xcite . in comoving coordinates ,",
    "the solution for the inhomogeneous chaplygin - gas cosmology is @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the determinant of the induced spatial metric tensor @xmath44 and @xmath17 can be taken as constant on the scales of interest .",
    "the generalization ( [ eq13 ] ) of equation ( [ eq002 ] ) allows us to implement the geometric version of the zeldovich approximation : the transformation from euler to lagrange ( comoving ) coordinates induces @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the deformation tensor , @xmath48 is the velocity potential , and the quantity @xmath49 describes the evolution of the perturbation .",
    "the zeldovich approximation offers a means of extrapolation into the nonperturbative regime via equation ( [ eq13 ] ) and @xmath50 where the @xmath51 are the eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "when one ( or more ) of the @xmath53 s is ( are ) positive , a caustic forms on which @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. , at the locations where structure forms the chaplygin gas behaves as dark matter .",
    "conversely , when all of the @xmath53 s are negative , a void forms , @xmath56 is driven to its limiting value @xmath32 , and the chaplygin gas behaves as dark energy , driving accelerated expansion .",
    "for the issue at hand , the usual zeldovich approximation has the shortcoming that the effects of finite sound speed are neglected .",
    "since the structure formation occurs in the decelerating phase , we can address the question in the newtonian limit @xmath57 by generalizing the spherical model . in the case of vanishing shear and rotation ,",
    "the continuity and euler - poisson equations become @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the adiabatic speed of sound given by @xmath61 @xmath62 is the local hubble parameter , and the time derivative is at the fixed lagrangian coordinate @xmath63 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the comoving coordinates @xmath64 . then writing @xmath65 @xmath66 subtracting the background , eliminating @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and changing the variables from @xmath69 to @xmath16 we find @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath16 . to solve this partial differential equation as it stands",
    ", one would need a rather involved numerical computation .",
    "instead , we proceed first by discussing the linear approximation of ( [ eq108 ] ) and then by solving the nonlinear problem imposing certain restrictions on the solution .",
    "first , consider the linear approximation which has been discussed in detail by fabris _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "keeping only the terms linear in @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and using the expansion @xmath75 one obtains an explicit solution for the perturbative density contrast which may be expressed as @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the bessel function , @xmath78 the comoving wave number , and @xmath79 the comoving sonic horizon given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 and the equivalent matter fraction @xmath82 thus , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , but for @xmath85 , @xmath86 undergoes damped oscillations .",
    "similar results have been obtained numerically in the relativistic case @xcite .",
    "next , consider the nonlinear evolution . to simplify equation ( [ eq108 ] )",
    ", it seems reasonable to make the following restriction : we take @xmath87 to be of fixed shape , wave number dependent size , and time dependent amplitude , then evaluate the comoving coordinate derivatives at the origin .",
    "that is to say , we retain the spirit of the spherical dust model where each comoving coordinate point is treated as an independent origin , but allow for the local coupling of the inhomogeneity curvature to sound waves .",
    "a convenient choice is the spherical lump @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary function satisfying @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath92 . evaluating ( [ eq108 ] ) at the origin",
    ", we obtain an ordinary differential equation for @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 the recommendations of equation ( [ eq008 ] ) are that it    * reproduces equation ( [ eq004 ] ) at linear order and * extends the spherical dust model by incorporating the jeans length through the last term .    to gain some perspective , with wmap fixing @xmath96 and reionization at a redshift of 20 , initial perturbations must satisfy @xmath97 on mass scales @xmath98 even for @xmath6cdm .",
    "taking @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we find @xmath101 , which coincides with @xmath102 at @xmath103 = 0.338 mpc corresponding to a protogalaxy mass @xmath26 = 2.3 @xmath104 .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the evolution of two initial perturbations from the radiation - matter equality for @xmath105 = 1/21 .",
    "in contrast to linear theory , where for any @xmath103 the acoustic horizon will eventually stop @xmath93 from growing irrespective of the initial value of the perturbation , here , for initial @xmath106 above a certain threshold , @xmath107 at finite @xmath16 just as in the dust model .",
    "conversely , at sufficiently small @xmath106 , the acoustic horizon can stop @xmath108 from growing even in a mildly nonlinear regime .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows how the threshold @xmath109 divides the two regimes depending on the comoving scale @xmath103 .",
    "qualitatively similar conclusions have been reached in a different way by avelino _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "one question is how accurate is the approximation ( [ eq308 ] ) which assumes that the comoving size is time independent ? to check this , we have relaxed the assumption ( [ eq308 ] ) by allowing the second derivative of @xmath110 at the origin to depend on @xmath16 , i.e. , the initial gaussian perturbation to have a variable width .",
    "evolution of the width is then described by a second - order differential equation coupled to equation ( [ eq008 ] ) . by solving this system of coupled equations",
    "we find a slight change of the behavior of @xmath93 in the linear regime but no significant change of the linear / nonlinear boundary depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the crucial question is what fraction of chaplygin gas goes into condensate .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we have noted that if this were 92% as given by the geometric zeldovich approximation , the cmb and the mass power spectrum would be reproduced . to answer this quantitatively",
    ", we adopt the press - schechter approach @xcite . assuming @xmath111 is given by a gaussian random field with dispersion @xmath112 , and including the notorious factor of 2 to account for the cloud in cloud problem , the condensate fraction at a scale @xmath103 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the threshold @xmath115 depicted in figure [ fig2 ] . in figure [ fig2 ] we also exhibit the dispersion @xmath116 calculated using @xmath110 above as the window function and the concordance model @xcite variance @xmath117 in figure [ fig3 ] we present @xmath118 calculated using ( [ eq401])-([eq403 ] ) with const=7.11@xmath119 , the spectral index @xmath120=1.02 , and the parametrization of bardeen _ et",
    "@xcite for the transfer function @xmath121 with @xmath122=0.04 .",
    "the parameters are fixed by fitting ( [ eq403 ] ) to the 2dfgrs power spectrum data @xcite .",
    "our result , in qualitative agreement with that of avelino et al @xcite , demonstrates that the collapse fraction is less than 1% , far too small to affect the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "thus we have found that nonlinear condensate , while present , is insufficient to save the simple chaplygin gas . in effect , the model is a victim of the radiation dominated phase which turns the harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xmath123 to @xmath124 at @xmath125 . in the pure chaplygin - gas universe there",
    "would inevitably be insufficient small scale power to drive condensation .",
    "this is a more definitive , if pessimistic , statement than [ 43 ] because we have actually followed the perturbations into the fully nonlinear regime .",
    "pragmatically , one can follow @xcite by introducing entropy perturbations to make the effective speed of sound vanish , even in the nonperturbative regime @xcite .",
    "caution should , however , be taken that imposing @xmath126 as an initial condition does not guarantee its propagation except in the long - wavelength limit @xcite where there is no problem in any case .",
    "more important is that the negative results were drawn without exploiting the braneworld connection of equation ( [ eq003 ] ) : in braneworld models ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) the einstein equations are modified , e.g. , by dark radiation and hence so are equations ( [ eq007a],[eq007b ] ) . from a different perspective , similar changes are brought about by the radion mode @xcite which gives a scalar - tensor gravity .    an interesting idea how to circumvent the difficulties with structure formation in the chaplygin gas model has recently been put forward by bento _ et al _ @xcite . following @xcite ,",
    "they have identified @xmath127 and @xmath128 , so that the energy - momentum tensor appears as a combination of dark matter @xmath129 and the cosmological `` constant '' @xmath6 .",
    "still , @xmath130 supplies the continuity and euler equations while @xmath131 sources the gravitational potential .",
    "in particular , @xmath132 remains in the euler equation .",
    "since @xmath133 in the newtonian context , and @xmath134 = @xmath135 , there is no modification to equations ( [ eq007a ] ) and ( [ eq007b ] ) , or the conclusions on structure formation .",
    "the reason bento et al @xcite conclude this bookkeeping allows @xmath136 to grow unimpeded is that they have taken over the equations of arcuri and waga @xcite , wherein @xmath6 is assumed time dependent but homogeneous - _ cf _ equation ( 14 ) therein . here , instead , @xmath6",
    "homogeneous implies @xmath129 homogeneous , i.e. @xmath136 = 0 .",
    "our prognosis is then that the crisis in quartessence cosmology is akin to that which existed in electroweak gauge theory before the higgs mechanism .",
    "the chaplygin - gas model is not so much wrong as incomplete .",
    "two of us , gbt and rdv wish to thank jihn kim for many enlightening discussions on the braneworld aspects of the chaplygin gas .",
