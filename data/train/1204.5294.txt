    "the discovery of the acceleration of the universe through the sneia hubble diagram @xcite , recently awarded by the nobel prize , has been latter confirmed by wide range of data , from more recent sneia data to baos and cmbr anisotropies @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", such overwhelming abundance of observational evidences in favour of the cosmic speed up does not fit in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) making clear that out theoretical background is seriously flawed . the naive interpretation that an unexpected new ingredient in the form of a negative pressured component is driving the acceleration poses difficult questions on its nature and",
    "nurture and introduces further problems hard to be solved .",
    "it has therefore gained more and more attraction the hypothesis that the cosmic speed up is rather the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "motivated by this consideration , much attention has been dedicated to @xmath2 theories @xcite where the scalar curvature @xmath3 is replaced by a suitably chosen function @xmath2 in the gravity lagrangian .",
    "looking for a correction to gr , it is instructive to remember that an equivalent formulation is represented by teleparallelism . in this theory ,",
    "torsion , instead of curvature , is responsible of the gravitational interaction @xcite and the weitzenbock connection replaces the levi - civita one on the underlying riemann - cartan spacetime . in this scenario , gravitational interaction is not replaced by geometry and the torsion acts as a force , allowing the interpretation of gravity as a gauge theory of the translation group @xcite . despite conceptual differences , teleparallel gravity and gr yield equivalent dynamics so that the interpretation of the gravitational interaction in terms of a curved or torsioned spacetime is only a matter of convenience , at least at the classical level .    in as much the same way as for @xmath2 theories , one can obtain a generalised teleparallel gravity replacing @xmath4 with a generic function @xmath0 thus opening the way to a rich phenomenology .",
    "a particular important consequence is the breakdown of the equivalence with the classical gr with the two theories now predicting a radically different dynamics @xcite .",
    "modified teleparallel gravity preserves the advantage of giving equations that are still second order in field derivatives opposite to the fourth order equations deduced in @xmath2 gravity thus avoiding unpleasant pathologies . on the other hand ,",
    "it suffers from the lack of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) so that all the 16 components of the vierbien are independent and one can not simply fix 6 of them by a gauge choice @xcite .    a critical role in generalised teleparallel theories is played by the choice of the functional expression for @xmath0 .",
    "the lack of firmly established theoretical constraints leaves open the way to a wide range of possibilities which can only be validated a posteriori , i.e. by contrasting their predictions with the observational data .",
    "this is the aim of the present work where we focus our attention on two particular classes able to give rise to a phantom - like behaviour of the effective torsion fluid .",
    "we then test these two models against sneia+grb hubble diagram , @xmath1 measurements from cosmic chronometers , baos data and the cmbr distance priors .",
    "although wide , the present dataset only traces the background expansion so that we will also investigate whether further insight into the properties of these models can be obtained by the analysis of the growth factor being this latter a quick way to look at how perturbations evolve in the proposed modified teleparallel scenarios .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sect.[f(t ) ] , we briefly review the cosmology of @xmath0 gravity and present the two models we are going to analyse . sect.[data ] is devoted to the likelihood analysis and the results , while sect.[growth ] enlarges the study to the growth factor .",

    "one can naively expect that , in order to get the cosmological counterpart of the field equations , one has simply to insert the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric into eqs.([eq : fieldeqs ] ) .",
    "actually , some care is needed since , due to the lack of lli , two pairs of vierbein that lead to the same metric tensor are not equivalent from the point of view of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , in case of spatially flat rw metric , a convenient choice is represented by the diagonal vierbein , i.e. @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the scale factor as function of cosmic time @xmath20 .",
    "with such a choice , the dynamical equations become :    @xmath21    while the torsion scalar reduces to @xmath22 with @xmath23 the usual hubble parameter and @xmath24 the energy density and pressure of the matter component .",
    "note that hereafter we will denote with a prime and with a dot differentiation with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the modified friedmann equations ( [ eq : ftfried ] ) can be rewritten in the usual form by introducing an effective dark torsion fluid with energy density reading    @xmath26    since matter still minimally couples to gravity only , its conservation equation will be unaffected so that we still have @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the scaling laws of dust matter and radiation . imposing the bianchi identities and the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory , the conservation equation for the effective torsion fluid reads    @xmath29    having set    @xmath30    for the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark torsion fluid .",
    "note the coupling to the radiation energy density through the term @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "one has @xmath33 and teleparallel gravity goes back to the standard gr , while the choice @xmath34 gives @xmath35 and the @xmath36cdm model is recovered .",
    "moving away from the naive choice @xmath34 gives rise to rich phenomenology in the dynamical evolution of generalised teleparallel theories .",
    "there are actually almost no theoretical hints on the functional form of @xmath0 with , on the contrary , many possible expressions leading to an accelerated expansion .",
    "it is particularly interesting to look at models which are able to give rise to an effective eos ( defined later ) crossing the phantom divide , i.e. , @xmath37 for @xmath38 with @xmath39 the phantom divide redshift .",

    "since the @xmath36cdm model is known to very well fit the data , it is reasonable to expect that , in order to fit the same data , the parameter space of both models will collapse in a region giving @xmath55 .",
    "fig.[fig : wzefftanh ] shows that , for the tanh model , this will favour values of @xmath56 and that the larger is @xmath57 , the smaller @xmath58 must be in order to have a today effective eos close to the @xmath36cdm one .",

    "put in other words , the @xmath61 parameters are intrinsically degenerate so that the condition @xmath55 is unable to discriminate among different parameter sets .",
    "actually , when fitting the data , we do not only look at the present day @xmath62 value , but also to its variation with @xmath63 . as we will see",
    ", this helps breaking ( at least partially ) the degeneracy among @xmath64 for the tanh model and @xmath61 for the exp one .",
    "figs.[fig : wzefftanh ] and [ fig : wzeffexp ] are nevertheless useful to quickly grasp what is the region of the parameter space of greater interest for both the tanh and exp @xmath0 models .",
    "the above considerations on the effective eos suggest that the proposed generalised teleparallel scenarios can represent viable alternatives to the @xmath36cdm model . to check whether this is indeed the case , we contrast them with a wide set of cosmological data as described below .      in order to answer the question whether @xmath0 gravity can reproduce the observed universe",

    "this can be easily understood looking at the right panel where one can see that the rate expansion @xmath1 is quite similar among the two models with the largest deviations occurring in the redshift range @xmath118 .",
    "being of order only few @xmath119 , it is easy to understand that the integration needed to compute the distance modulus easily washes out the differences between the two models thus leading to the almost perfectly superimposed curves shown in fig.[fig : bfplot ] .",
    "another way to explain why the two models make so similar predictions is to look at the reconstructed effective torsion fluid eos .",

    ", the red solid curve refers to the best fit model , while the blue dot - dashed ( dashed ) one gives , for each @xmath63 , the median value ( the @xmath109 confidence range ) as estimated evaluating @xmath120 for the model parameters in the mcmc chain . for both best fit models",
    "( i.e. , look at the red curves ) , the eos stays close to the cosmological constant value @xmath121 up to @xmath122 so that the dynamics is approximately the same as the @xmath36cdm one . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath53 has a radical different behaviour for the two models in the higher redshift regime .",
    "indeed , while the tanh effective torsion fluid has an increasing eos , the exp model eos stays roughly constant to a value slightly smaller than the present day one thus better mimicking a @xmath36cdm scenario .",
    "nevertheless , both best fit models make similar predictions for the cmbr distance priors as a result of the very small contribution of the torsion fluid to the energy budget at the last scattering surface .    as a final remark",
    ", it is worth spending some more words on an unusual feature of the exp model .",
    "as one can see from table[tab : expfit ] , the best fit @xmath61 parameters are strongly different from their median values with @xmath60 being outside the @xmath110 confidence range . as a consequence ,",
    "the reconstructed torsion fluid eos for the best fit model is outside the @xmath109 confidence range delimited by the blue dashed lines in the right panel of fig.[fig : eosplot ] .",
    "such an unexpected result is actually a consequence of the strong degeneracy among the model parameters . as already highlighted when commenting fig.[fig : wzeffexp ] , for a given @xmath57 value , there are more than one @xmath60 value giving the same @xmath123 .",
    "this intrinsic degeneracy can only partially be broken by fitting data at different redshifts . however , since most part of the data probes the range @xmath124 , all the couples @xmath61 giving @xmath125 over this range are allowed by the fit .",
    "this is indeed the case for the exp models with @xmath61 set to their best fit values ( leading to @xmath126 ) or to the median ones ( giving @xmath127 ) . for larger @xmath63 ,",
    "the median and best fit models eos are radically different , but the predicted distance priors values are nevertheless almost the same since the torsion fluid becomes subdominant so that the details of its eos turn out to be meaningless . in the following",
    ", we will however set the @xmath61 parameters to their median values since such a choice more reliably takes into account how the data constrain the exp model parameters space .",
    "for the tanh ( red solid ) and exp ( blue dashed ) @xmath0 models superimposed to the @xcite data.,width=283 ]    the above analysis , while confirming that both @xmath0 models nicely work at reproducing the available data , has also highlighted that probing only the background expansion does not allow us to conclusively discriminate between them and the @xmath36cdm scenario . in order to deepen the investigation and look for a way to put stronger constraints",
    ", one has to resort to the analysis of the evolution of the perturbations . as a first step ,",
    "we consider here the growth factor @xmath128 with @xmath129 the matter density contrast .",
    "the @xmath130 evolution can easily be determined solving @xcite    @xmath131    which is formally identical to the @xmath36cdm one provided the newton constant @xmath132 is replaced by the effective one @xmath133 .",
    "it is worth stressing that eq.([eq : growthfac ] ) actually holds only in the sub - horizon limit , i.e. , under the approximation @xmath134 with @xmath135 the comoving expansion rate .",
    "a much more complicated expression @xcite holds in the general case and must be used in evaluating large scale probes as the matter power spectrum and , for instance , weak lensing observables .",
    "however , for this preliminary investigation , we will use the simpler eq.([eq : growthfac ] ) which is well suited for galactic and galaxy cluster scales .",
    "fig.[fig : gzplot ] shows the growth factor for the best fit tanh and the median exp models together with a compilation of @xmath136 measurement taken from @xcite .",
    "as it is evident , the two models can be easily differentiated from the different @xmath136 behaviour , while their background expansion is almost the same as shown by the very close agreement between the corresponding @xmath137 and @xmath1 curves plotted in fig.[fig : bfplot ] . according to the @xmath136 values ,",
    "structures growth is faster in the tanh than in the exp model so that an observational determination of @xmath136 can easily discriminate among the two @xmath0 scenarios . indeed , using the data plotted , we get @xmath138 for the tanh model indicating a strong disagreement , while better results are obtained for the exp model leading to @xmath139 ( still large , but mainly due to the highest @xmath63 point which is not even fitted by the @xmath36cdm growth factor ) .",
    "these values have , however , to be taken with great caution and should not be considered as a definitive evidence of the exp model working better than the tanh one .",
    "first , most of the measurements of @xmath136 reported in @xcite actually refers to @xmath140 with @xmath141 the bias of the galaxy population used to trace the growth factor .",
    "since the bias is related to the underlying gravity theory , a modified lagrangian can in principle introduce deviations from the standard collapse scenario thus leading to a different and possibly scale dependent bias .",
    "second , @xmath136 is sometimes obtained from a preliminary modelling of the matter power spectrum as in @xcite which partially relies on the assumption of a fiducial @xmath36cdm model to convert from the redshift to the real space clustering . while the background expansion is likely the same as the @xmath36cdm one up to intermediate @xmath63 , the modeling of the power spectrum and its distortions can be different so that the inferred @xmath136 estimate should be taken _",
    "cum grano salis_. motivated by these considerations , we prefer to be conservative and consider fig.[fig : gzplot ] as a strong evidence that accelerating @xmath0 models with a quite similar background expansion can be easily discriminated by their growth factor evolution .",
    "interpreting gravitational interactions in terms of the torsion rather than the scalar curvature leads to the equivalent teleparallel formulation of gr . adding a further @xmath0 term into the gravity lagrangian then modifies general relativity allowing for a wider range of possible dynamical behaviour .",
    "in particular , for some particular choices of the @xmath0 functional expression , it is possible to get an accelerating expansion in a matter only universe with the effective torsion fluid playing the role of dark energy .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have here considered two generalisations of teleparallel models assigned by the expression ( [ eq : ftmods ] ) for the @xmath0 function .",
    "we have convincingly shown that both models are in excellent agreement with a wide set of cosmological data , from the sneia+grb hubble diagram to the @xmath1 measurements , baos and cmbr distance priors .",
    "having been designed to give an accelerated expansion , the parameter space of both models collapses into a region giving rise to a background dynamics similar to the @xmath36cdm one . as a consequence ,",
    "the two models can be hardly discriminated based on the dataset we have used .",
    "it is worth stressing that this is not a limitation of the data , but rather an intrinsic feature of how the models have been worked out . as such , improving the precision of the measurements or increasing the statistics does not help in discriminating among the @xmath0 models and the @xmath36cdm one . on the contrary , one has to resort to different tracers which are related to the evolution of the perturbations , the simplest one being the growth factor @xmath136 . on small scales",
    ", the impact of torsion only introduces a redshift dependent rescaling of the gravitational constant which now becomes @xmath133 .",
    "this only modification considerably changes the growth factor leading to a scaling of @xmath142 with @xmath63 which strongly depend on the @xmath0 model considered .",
    "as fig.[fig : gzplot ] clearly shows , it is easy to discriminate between the two models provided one has a model independent estimate of the growth factor as function of @xmath63 .",
    "however , to this end , one should carefully take into account how the collapse of structures take place in the modified regime introduced by the effective torsion field . to this end ,",
    "the weak field limit of @xmath0 models must be investigated thus also leading to the determination of the gravitational potential on galactic scales and its impact on the galaxy dynamics .    on the largest scales ,",
    "the torsion field modifies the growth of perturbations by altering both the gravitational constant and the friction term @xcite . as a consequence",
    "a richer phenomenology is achieved possibly leading to other ways to discriminate among @xmath0 models and dark energy ones .",
    "two candidate probes are the matter power spectrum @xmath143 and cosmic shear . in the first case ,",
    "the derivation of @xmath143 is likely quite easy to achieve the main deviations from the standard gr one being encoded by the scale dependent growth factor .",
    "however , the comparison with the data asks for two further effects to be taken into account .",
    "first , what we actually observe is the galaxy power spectrum which is related to the matter one through the bias @xmath144 ( if we neglect redshift distortions ) . while for gr models one can assume @xmath144 to be scale independent , this is not guaranteed a priori for @xmath0 models . as a possible way out",
    ", one could rely on a parameterized phenomenological ansatz although this strategy could introduce a degeneracy with the @xmath0 parameters . on smaller scales ,",
    "where @xmath136 is scale independent , nonlinear effects start becoming important so that one should find a way to take them into account .",
    "as far as we know it , a mapping from the linear @xmath143 to the nonlinear one is still unavailable for @xmath0 theories thus preventing a straightforward comparison between predicted and observed @xmath143 .",
    "a somewhat better situation holds for the computation of the cosmic shear power spectrum .",
    "indeed , it probes the full matter distribution along the line of sight and not the clustered component . as such",
    ", the bias plays no role at all so that there is no need to preliminary investigate how galaxy formation takes place in @xmath0 models .",
    "moreover , the cosmic shear power spectrum allows us to probe the largest scales where nonlinear effects may be neglected thus putting more emphasis on the modifications due to the deviations of @xmath0 theory from gr .",
    "we therefore consider cosmic shear as a more promising tool to discriminate among rival teleparallel scenarios and between @xmath0 and gr and deserve a detailed analysis to a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
