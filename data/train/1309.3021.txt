    "systems of self - propelled particles ( spps ) , which consume energy to maintain a persistent non - brownian motion , exhibit an abundance of fascinating non - equilibrium collective behaviors  such as swarming , swirling , and clustering @xcite .",
    "examples are found in very different areas of physics and biology , and range from actin filaments and microtubules in motility assays @xcite through metallic nano - rods @xcite to flocking of birds @xcite and groups of people @xcite . in all of these examples ,",
    "spps employ different propulsion mechanisms , and also interact with each other in different ways , including direct physical contact @xcite , chemotaxis @xcite , hydrodynamic interactions @xcite , and restricted visual contact @xcite .",
    "however , the collective behavior of spps systems is surprisingly similar , displaying phenomena such as giant density fluctuations with anomalously slow relaxation @xcite , order - disorder phase transition with increasing noise and decreasing density @xcite , etc .    since the simplest model of interacting spps",
    "was introduced by vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite , nowadays widely referred as the  vicsek model \" @xcite , collective behavior of spp systems has attracted much interest @xcite . in the vicsek model ,",
    "point particles moving with constant velocity align their directions of motion with the average direction of other particles in a prescribed interaction range , while internal or external noise is taken into account by adding a random increment to their orientation vectors . by a variation of the system parameters ,",
    "e.g. the particle density and the strength of the perturbation , such a simple system has been found to undergo an order - disorder phase transition , whose nature ( first or second order ) is related to the particle velocity and the way the perturbation is introduced @xcite . according to these studies , the initial conditions and settings of the simulation , the type of interaction and the boundary conditions play an important role in the formation of certain collective patterns of motion @xcite .",
    "a special , but not rare class of patterns of collective motion in spps systems are swirls or vortices , in which a group of particles circle around a common center . in experiments , swirls and vortices",
    "emerge both in non - living particle systems ( vertically vibrated granular rods @xcite , motility assays of actin filaments @xcite or microtubules @xcite ) and in systems of living micro - organisms ( bacteria colonies @xcite , zoo - plankton under optical stimulus @xcite , sea - urchin sperm trapped near a substrate @xcite ) . in simulations , the emergence of swirls and vortices was found to depend on the initial conditions and the model settings , such as a circular boundary @xcite , alignment with a  blind angle \" of interaction behind each agent @xcite , a harmonic attractive pair potential with a noise above a critical value @xcite , and hydrodynamic interactions @xcite . in most of the computational models exhibiting vortices ,",
    "a single spp is either assumed to perform a random walk @xcite , or to move with constant magnitude of velocity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a class of spps which move  in the absence of noise  along _ curved trajectories _ rather than straight lines , which we call circle spps .",
    "the driving force of a circle spp does not coincides with its propagation direction , so that its trajectory is a cycloid in three spatial dimensions or a circle in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "artificial circle swimmers can be constructed by introducing a tilted or bend structure to catalytically driven colloidal rods @xcite , giving thermophoretic colloidal swimmers a l - shape @xcite , or by designing micro - machines of connected beads which are moved relative to each other in a time - irreversible multi - step cycle @xcite .",
    "examples of circle swimmers in living systems include certain bacteria @xcite and spermatozoa @xcite  when the micro - organisms are attracted or confined in their motion to a surface or wall .",
    "the most carefully analyzed experiment on the collective motion of circle spps might be the self - organized vortices of sea - urchin sperm @xcite .",
    "the 50-@xmath3m - long sperm circle clockwise when they gather at a substrate . with increasing surface density of sperm ,",
    "the system exhibits a transition from a disordered state of randomly distributed sperm to a self - organized vortex - array state with local hexagonal order , in which each vortex consists of several sperm . in ref .",
    ", the emergence of this structure is attributed to the hydrodynamic interactions between individual sperm and between sperm vortices .",
    "however , simulations suggest that the steric interactions between rod - like spps @xcite and sinusoidal beating flagella @xcite strongly contribute to the collective motion and aggregation .",
    "while the morphology and properties of swirls and vortices in straight - trajectory spps systems have been studied intensively in recent years @xcite , much less is known theoretically about the collective motion of circle spps @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the effect of the spontaneous circular trajectory on the collective behavior of spps is essential for the understanding of many biological phenomena and for the design of microscopic machines .",
    "in addition to the parameters of spps ( like velocity , particle density , interaction range , and noise amplitude ) , the circle spp systems have at least the spontaneous curvature of the particle trajectory as an extra parameter . the larger parameter space suggests a more complex behavior of these systems . in order to study such systems , highly simplified models are often very useful , as has been demonstrated by the success of the vicsek model .",
    "an example for circle swimmers is the simplified model of ref .  , designed to interpret the formation of vortex arrays of sea urchin sperm . in this model ,",
    "each sperm is described by a point particle at its trajectory center , with a pairwise short - range attraction arising from hydrodynamic forces , and a longer range repulsion due to steric or hydrodynamic origin .",
    "inspired by this model , we construct a model of circle spps by point - like particles with a constant propagation velocity , where particles interact through a `` velocity - trajectory coordination '' , which takes the trajectory centers of neighbor particles into account .",
    "this algorithm of interaction is different from both the  trajectory - center coordination \" of ref .   and the  velocity coordination \" of the vicsek model @xcite ( which averages the velocity of neighboring particles ) .",
    "we will analyze this model in detail , and show that it describes vortex formation and the evolution of a stationary vortex pattern .",
    "in addition to the point - like circle spps model , we also study curved , sinusoidal - beating flagella .",
    "sinusoidal beating of a filament or elongated body is a common self - propulsion mechanism in biological systems with low - reynolds - number hydrodynamics , e.g. nematodes @xcite and sperm of higher animals @xcite .",
    "the sinusoidal wave propagates from one end to the other on the filament - like body and pushes the surrounding fluid backwards to generate a forward force .",
    "thus , the cell or organism gains velocity in opposite direction of wave propagation . as indicated by experiments of biological systems @xcite and simulations of model systems @xcite , the sinusoidally undulating motion of the body does not destroy the general collective behaviors of rod - like spps .",
    "our flagellum model is coarse - grained as particles connected by harmonic springs , and the hydrodynamics is either approximated by anisotropic friction , or calculated by using multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpc ) , a mesoscopic particle - based simulation approach @xcite . by introducing a non - zero average curvature in the beating plane",
    ", the undulating flagellum traces out a circular trajectory in two dimensions , reminiscent the trajectory of sea urchin sperm at a substrate @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us to analyze the contribution of volume exclusion and hydrodynamic interaction separately .",
    "the study provides insight into the effect of flagellar properties , such as frequency distribution and spontaneous curvature , on the collective motion and the emerging vortex patterns .",

    ", the choice of the alignment rule strongly depends on the interaction range relative to the preferred swimming radius .",

    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]bc , the flagellum vortices are closed rings composed of synchronized flagella .",
    "this closed structure makes the fusion of large vortices to happen very infrequently , because the necessary force to open such a structure to fuse two neighboring vortices is very large .",
    "therefore , as suggested by our circle spps simulations , the flagellum system experiences vortex formation and reorganization only during the early stages of structure formation , corresponding to period i in the circle spp system , which leads to vortices described by an order parameter @xmath2 which depends linearly on the particle density .",
    "the next step to raise the aggregation number , corresponding to period iii in the circle spp system , which requires the fusion of heavy vortices , is prevented by their nearly impenetrable closed structure .",
    "second , an extraordinary heavy vortex can not exist for long , because the maximum mass of a vortex is determined by the balance of forces between flagella .",
    "for a flagellum swimming at a distance @xmath199 from the center , the prevalent trajectory curvature is @xmath242 , while the preferred trajectory curvature of a flagellum is @xmath243 .",
    "when @xmath244 , the flagellum at @xmath199 pushes outwards and exert an outward force on other flagella in outer layers ; similarly , when @xmath245 , a flagellum at @xmath199 pushes inwards and exerts an inward force on other flagella in inner layers .",
    "when @xmath199 exceeds @xmath7 , an instability should develop , which leads to a breakup into smaller vortices of radius @xmath246 . for systems with larger @xmath7",
    ", the region @xmath244 is larger and the typical difference between @xmath242 and @xmath243 is smaller , so that the maximum vortex mass is larger than for systems with smaller @xmath7 . therefore , @xmath2 increases with increasing @xmath7 for fixed @xmath98 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter]ab .",
    "third , consider now a large flagellum density , for which the system is already full of vortices of similar mass , frequently colliding with each other ( see movie s3 in supplemental material @xcite ) .",
    "a further increase of @xmath98 starts to destroy the vortex structure and the order parameter @xmath2 decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter]a for @xmath247 . such a decrease of @xmath2 was not observed in the sea - urchin sperm experiment @xcite because the experimental system was not strictly two - dimensional .",
    "we conjecture that at a certain surface density of sperm , the substrate is completely packed with vortices and can not absorb any more cells .",
    "the local hexagonal order of the sperm vortex array @xcite is a clue for this close packing .",
    "a further increase of the surface density of sperm is not possible because higher density will cause more frequent collision and consequently expel some sperm from the near - substrate layer .",
    "it seems not possible @xcite to obtain a higher surface density of sperm than 6000/mm@xmath248 , the largest density investigated in ref .  .",
    "for higher densities in the experiments , multiple layers of sperm developed , and the layers on top were neither ordered nor destroying the pattern below @xcite .",
    "a possibility to increase the density further in experiments might be to restrict the sperm in a narrow slit of one layer thickness between two flat substrates .",
    "the variance @xmath81 of the frequency distribution also influence the order parameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter]b .",
    "@xmath2 is not sensitive to @xmath81 when @xmath249 , but decreases with increasing @xmath81 for @xmath250 .",
    "when there are large differences between the frequencies of flagella in a vortex , the collisions between the undulating shapes increase the short - range repulsion , separate the flagella and cause a looser vortex structure , so that vortex break up more easily in collisions with other vortices . at small @xmath251 , this effect is small .",
    "note that even for @xmath252 , vortices still exist , as indicated by the density correlation functions . however , stable structures hardly exist for a long time .",
    "the frequent fission and fusion of vortices make @xmath2 small , although the system is not completely disordered .",
    "we have simulated systems of self - propelled particles with preferred circular trajectories ( circle spps ) interacting via a velocity - trajectory coordination rule , and systems of curved flagella propelled by a sinusoidal beating motion . in both systems",
    ", we observe the formation of vortex arrays , controlled by particle density , interaction range , and diameter of the preferred circular trajectory .    for the circle - spp systems , the vortex array shows liquid - like rather than hexagonal spatial order .",
    "the diameter of the vortices , @xmath114 , is about the diameter of a single particle trajectory @xmath7 with a slight increase with the diameter of the interaction region @xmath8 , but is not sensitive to the particle density @xmath98 .",
    "the average distance between neighbor vortices , @xmath136 , is also not sensitive to @xmath98 , but increases quickly with increasing @xmath8 . a transition from a light - vortex - dominated state ( at low @xmath98 and small @xmath8 ) to a heavy - vortex - dominated state ( at high @xmath98 or large @xmath8 ) is observed .",
    "we use an order parameter @xmath2 to characterize the degree of the vortex formation . by comparing the time evolution of @xmath2 , we find that the vortex formation can be divided into three time periods . during period",
    "i , the particles collect neighbor ones to form vortices and @xmath2 increase quickly with time .",
    "the increase of @xmath183 during period i is slightly elevated with @xmath98 , but is not sensitive to @xmath8 . in the subsequent period ii ,",
    "@xmath183 increases very slowly .",
    "in period iii , the vortex mass increases again more rapidly through vortex collision and fusion .",
    "note that environmental noise is not described in our model .",
    "therefore the fission , fusion and displacement of vortices is purely the result of multi - particle interactions of circle spps .    in order to compare with the experiments of sperm cells near surfaces , we have also studied a more detailed model of curved , sinusoidally beating flagella .",
    "vortex patterns in this system emerge from the hard - core repulsion of the curved body of the elongated self - propelled particles moving in a viscous environment . in the simulations with anisotropic frictions ,",
    "the collective motion of the curved flagella system agrees very well with the behavior of the circle spps system , as well as the phenomenon observed in the sea - urchin sperm experiments @xcite . as in the circle spps system ,",
    "the average size of the vortices @xmath114 equals approximately @xmath7 , and slightly increases with the flagellum density . by comparing @xmath136 with the circle spps systems , we find that the size of the effective interaction region of a curved flagellum can be approximately identified with @xmath253 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath2 increases with @xmath98 as well as @xmath7 .",
    "the fraction @xmath235 coincides the value @xmath254 calculated by using the data from @xcite for sea - urchin sperm system .    in conclusion",
    ", the collective motion of self - propelled particles , which leads to the formation of vortex arrays , can be well reproduced by circle spps with a velocity - trajectory coupling interaction .",
    "the velocity - trajectory coordination rule is a different interaction type than the velocity coordination rules employed since the vicsek model @xcite for the simulations of collective motion .",
    "such an interaction mimics , for example , the hard - core interaction of curved , sinusoidal beating flagella .",
    "the analysis of a more specific model of beating flagella allows to elucidate the features related to an explicit propulsion mechanism and physical interactions .",
