    "among the many fascinating properties of highly excited rydberg atoms @xcite , the strong interaction between pairs of rydberg atoms has proven to be the key feature for diverse applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "a particularly important concept is the rydberg blockade @xcite , where the excitation of two or more atoms to a rydberg state is prevented due to the interaction .",
    "the rydberg blockade of atomic ensembles @xcite has been observed in ultracold atomic systems in the frozen rydberg - gas regime @xcite , both in bulk ensembles @xcite and in small systems supporting only a single excitation @xcite .",
    "more recently , experiments have also begun to probe rydberg interaction effects in room - temperature thermal vapor @xcite .",
    "based on the rydberg blockade , atomic two - qubit gates have been demonstrated @xcite as basic building blocks for large - scale neutral atom quantum registers @xcite . in turn , the power - law decay of the rydberg interaction provides interaction over long range and facilitates the extension to multi - qubit rydberg - mediated gates in such registers @xcite .",
    "such tailored atomic ensembles are also ideal for investigating processes such as excitation transfer @xcite or simulation of spin systems @xcite .",
    "the mapping of rydberg interactions onto photons by means of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite has emerged as a powerful approach to realizing few - photon optical nonlinearities @xcite , enabling a variety of optical quantum information applications such as highly efficient single - photon generation @xcite , entanglement generation between light and atomic excitations @xcite , single - photon all - optical switches @xcite and transistors @xcite , single - photon subtraction @xcite , and interaction - induced @xmath0-phase shifts @xcite . additionally , rydberg eit provides access to novel phenomena such as attractive interaction between single photons @xcite , crystallization of photons @xcite , or photonic scattering resonances @xcite , as well as spatially resolved detection of single rydberg atoms in a bulk medium @xcite .",
    "recent rydberg eit experiments , which simultaneously use rydberg @xmath1- and @xmath2-states @xcite or two different @xmath1-states @xcite further increase the flexibility of manipulating weak light fields @xcite .",
    "detailed understanding of the rydberg interaction is also required for the concept of rydberg dressing , where a small rydberg admixture modifies the interaction between ground - state atoms in ultracold gases @xcite . in particular , by the choice of the rydberg state",
    ", one can map the anisotropy of the rydberg interaction onto the ground - state atoms @xcite .",
    "experimental demonstrations of rydberg dressing have recently been performed using individual atoms @xcite or atomic ensembles in an optical lattice @xcite . finally , the rich structure of the rydberg interaction potentials supports bound molecular states formed by two rydberg atoms @xcite , which have been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "prediction of the equilibrium distance and vibrational spectra for these macro - dimers requires precise knowledge of the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the physics of rydberg interaction has been well - established for decades @xcite . as long as the two atoms are well separated and",
    "their wave functions do not overlap , one needs to consider only the electrostatic interaction between two localized charge distributions , most conveniently utilizing the well - known electric multipole expansion in spherical coordinates @xcite .",
    "the leading relevant term in this expansion is the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , which for unperturbed rydberg atoms at large separation results in the extensively studied van - der - waals interaction @xcite .",
    "more generally , as long as the interaction energies are small compared to the level spacing of the unperturbed rydberg pair states , perturbative calculations offer a very convenient method for determining the radial @xcite and angular @xcite behavior of the rydberg potentials .",
    "nevertheless , the rapid experimental progress in recent years has led to a growing number of experiments for which the perturbative calculation is no longer sufficient .",
    "for example , this approach fails when shorter atomic distances are probed and state - mixing due to the interaction becomes significant .",
    "the dipole - quadrupole contribution to the interaction has recently been observed both in ultracold @xcite and room - temperature @xcite systems in experiments with large excitation bandwidth , while the correct prediction of macro - dimer photo - association spectra required the inclusion of terms up to octupolar order in the potential calculation @xcite . in experiments utilizing very high principal quantum numbers",
    "@xmath3  @xcite , state - mixing and additional molecular resonances @xcite become relevant already at large interatomic distances and make non - perturbative potential calculations necessary .",
    "the nature of the interaction also changes when coupled pair states are ( nearly ) resonant @xcite .",
    "such degeneracies , or frster - resonances , can occur naturally or by shifting the pair state energies via external electric  @xcite or microwave  @xcite fields .",
    "such resonances can greatly enhance the rydberg interaction strength @xcite .",
    "when spin - orbit coupling as well as stark and zeeman splitting of all involved levels are taken into account , the resonances can exhibit new features and a rich angular dependence @xcite .",
    "full potential calculations including the external fields reveal the number of states which must be included in specific cases for accurate results .    as consequence of the rapid evolution of the field ,",
    "it becomes more and more common to rely on numerical diagonalization of the rydberg interaction hamiltonian including higher orders of the multipole expansion @xcite .",

    "the inset shows its dependence on the momentum quantum numbers .",
    "the le  roy radius for alkali atoms is bounded from above by the le  roy radius for hydrogen atoms @xmath8 @xcite where @xmath9 is the bohr radius . ]",
    "we study two neutral atoms , each having one electron excited into a rydberg state , as depicted in figure [ fig : system ] . because we are only interested in interatomic distances @xmath6 for which the rydberg atoms are well - separated ,",
    "the interaction between the atoms is dominated by the strong interactions of the rydberg electrons . using the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , the corresponding two - atom hamiltonian is of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 contains the energies of the unperturbed rydberg states .",
    "the operator @xmath12 captures the interaction between the two rydberg electrons , the two ionic cores , and the rydberg electron of one atom and the ionic core of the other atom .",
    "this is the standard treatment of two interacting rydberg atoms which is discussed in similar detail in @xcite .",
    "because the hyperfine splitting of rydberg levels is much smaller than typical interaction energies @xcite , we use the fine - structure basis . as we will see later",
    ", we can assume the two rydberg electrons to be distinguishable particles .",
    "hence , we use the product basis @xmath13 in our notation . ] . note that the two rydberg atoms are allowed to be of different chemical species .",
    "the operator @xmath11 can be written as @xmath14 we use the common convention that the quantization axis points along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "the potential energy @xmath16 of an electron excited to a rydberg state is given by a formula similar to the one known for the hydrogen atom @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the modified rydberg constant and @xmath19 is the quantum defect @xcite .",
    "these species - dependent parameters are used to capture subtle differences between the bare coulomb potential of a hydrogen core and the actual potential felt by the rydberg electron . for details on these parameters ,",
    "see [ sec : potential ] .    for calculating the interaction energy @xmath12 , we neglect retardation effects @xcite as the wavelengths of the involved rydberg - rydberg transitions are much larger than the considered interatomic distances . furthermore , we assume the interatomic distance to be larger than the le  roy radius @xcite @xmath20 see figure [ fig : system ] .",
    "this assumption tremendously simplifies the calculations .",
    "it ensures that the electronic wave functions do not overlap , so that exchange interaction and charge overlap interaction can be neglected .",
    "thus , we can treat the electrons as distinguishable particles .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to use a multipole expansion for the interaction energy . in order to do so",
    ", we first think of the two rydberg atoms as classical charge distributions @xcite . their electrostatic interaction energy is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the distance vector between the atoms .",
    "the positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the electrons of the first and second atom are given as relative coordinates in the body frame of the respective atom , see figure [ fig : system ] .",
    "the multipole expansion leads to @xcite @xmath25 the exact form of @xmath26 depends on the choice of the coordinate systems used to label the positions of the electrons . if we choose the coordinate systems such that the @xmath15-axis points along @xmath22 , i.e. along the interatomic axis , we get the comparatively simple result @xmath27 where we use @xmath28 and binomial coefficients to shorten our notation . this result transfers into quantum mechanics by canonical quantization .",
    "thus , the spherical multipole moments @xmath29 and @xmath30 become the spherical multipole operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 , that operate on the rydberg electron of the first and second atom , respectively .",
    "the operators are of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 are spherical harmonics that is commonly used in quantum mechanics . here , @xmath35 are legendre polynomials and @xmath36 the condon - shortley phase . ] .",
    "note that , in our notation of these operators , the spherical basis is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "the spherical multipole operator @xmath38 corresponds to the @xmath39-pole momentum .",
    "the multipole expansion ( [ eqn : multipoleexpansion ] ) is a series expansion of the interaction potential in powers @xmath40 of the inverse interatomic distance .",
    "the series expansion starts at @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the contribution of lowest order is the dipole - dipole interaction which reflects the neutral charge of the rydberg atoms .",
    "section [ sec : higherorders ] discusses the relevance of higher - order contributions . in general , the order at which we can reasonably truncate the expansion increases with decreasing interatomic distance .",
    "the spherical multipole operators are composed of the product of a radial and an angular operator whose matrix elements can be calculated independently from one another with the formalism shown in [ sec : radial ] and [ sec : angularmatrixelements ] .",
    "the independent calculation works because the potential for the rydberg electron is spherically symmetric , so that the rydberg wave function can be separated into the product of a radial function @xmath42 and a spin spherical harmonic @xmath43 @xcite ,    @xmath44       are shown .",
    "zeeman map for the sodium atom . here",
    ", all the states within the plot range are depicted .",
    "the diamagnetic interaction increases the energies of the states .",
    "however , as diamagnetism does not contribute to the linear zeeman effect it can be neglected for a weak magnetic field . ]    in general , the interaction between an atom and the electromagnetic field can be taken care of by employing the minimal - coupling replacement @xcite .",
    "assuming that the fields are static and homogeneous , this general approach gets reduced to adding the electric interaction @xmath45 and the magnetic interaction @xmath46 to the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath47 is the electric dipole operator , and @xmath48 is the magnetic dipole operator .",
    "the @xmath49-factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 characterize the magnetic moment through orbital motion and spin .",
    "the constant @xmath52 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the term @xmath53 is the diamagnetic interaction .",
    "most importantly , these formulas allow for electromagnetic fields in arbitrary directions and in particular facilitate arbitrary angles between magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the final hamiltonian is @xmath54    in order to calculate matrix elements of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we have to do some preparatory work . in [ sec : angularmatrixelements ] , we review a powerful formalism to calculate matrix elements of spherical tensor operators .",
    "to make use of it , the notation of equations ( [ eqn : electric ] ) and ( [ eqn : magnetic ] ) has to be changed from the cartesian basis to the spherical basis @xmath37 . in the spherical basis the components of , for example , the electric field are given by @xmath57 using this expression , the interaction with an electric field reads @xmath58 with spherical harmonics @xmath34 .",
    "likewise we can express the dot product of @xmath59 and the magnetic field in the spherical basis @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the spherical momentum operators .",
    "the operators @xmath62 are related to the ladder operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the diamagnetic interaction in the spherical basis reads @xmath65    the entire atom - field interaction is now expressed in terms of spherical tensor operators , and we can proceed to calculate the matrix elements via the formalism of [ sec : radial ] and [ sec : angularmatrixelements ] .",
    "this enables not only the calculation of pair potentials in the presence of external fields but also the computation of stark / zeeman maps , see figure [ fig : starkzeeman ] .      knowing how to calculate matrix elements facilitates a rigorous derivation of the selection rules .",
    "the results for spherical harmonics and momentum operators are shown in table  [ tab : selectionrules ] .",
    "note that the selection rules for spherical harmonics directly apply to the multipole operators .",
    "the selection rules greatly reduce the number of matrix elements which must be calculated explicitly for the construction of the pair hamiltonian , enabling a significant reduction of computation time .",

    "the point group of the system is @xmath78/@xmath79 if the system is heteronuclear / homonuclear @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of the point group are conserved by the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) of the two rydberg atoms in the absence of external fields .    from the symmetry under rotation about the interatomic axis",
    ", it follows that the projection of the total angular momentum on the interatomic axis is conserved .",
    "since we have chosen the quantization axis to be parallel to the interatomic axis , the total magnetic quantum number @xmath80 is conserved .",

    ", we have to rotate the coordinate system .",
    "assuming that the interatomic axis lies in the @xmath106-plane , a rotation around the @xmath107-axis is needed .",
    "the rotation changes the representation of the quantum mechanical states as well as the representation of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the figure illustrates our definition of the rotation angle @xmath108 . ]    as discussed in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] , the formula for the atom - atom interaction ( [ eqn : multipole ] ) is only valid if we are in a coordinate system @xmath109 where the @xmath15-axis , which we chose as the quantization axis , points in the same direction as the interatomic axis .",
    "however , sometimes one would like to use a different coordinate system .",
    "for example , when the rydberg state is excited by a laser pulse , it is convenient to use a coordinate system @xmath110 where the @xmath15-axis points along the laser beam .    to ease the calculation ,",
    "let us assume that the interatomic axis lies in the @xmath106-plane of @xmath110 .",

    "the rotation angle @xmath108 is defined as the angle between the interatomic axis and the @xmath15-axis , and is called interaction angle .    given that our coordinate systems are right - handed and the rotation of the coordinate system is counter - clockwise if the @xmath107-axis points towards the observer , the magnetic and electric fields transform according to @xmath111    any state @xmath112 in the lab frame , i.e.  with the quantization axis parallel to the laser beam , should be expressed as a linear superposition of states @xmath113 whose quantization axis points along the @xmath15-axis of @xmath109 , @xmath114 where the coefficients @xmath115 are elements of the wigner ( lowercase ) @xmath116-matrix @xcite .",
    "if we had not fixed the interatomic axes in the @xmath106-plane , we would have to use the wigner ( uppercase ) @xmath117-matrix instead .",

    ", we can switch to the coordinate system @xmath109 and perform all calculations there .    in the absence of external electromagnetic fields , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and thus the pair potentials",
    "do not depend on the interaction angle .",
    "however , the _ overlap _ of each unperturbed state @xmath118 with a particular eigenstate does depend on the interaction angle",
    ". the quantum numbers of the unperturbed state become good quantum numbers if the interatomic distance approaches infinity and the atoms are not perturbed by external fields .",
    ", the hamiltonian matrix for a homonuclear pair of atoms decomposes into a gerade / ungerade block ( g / u ) .",
    "pure dipole - dipole interaction additionally conserves @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , @xmath120 is conserved if the interatomic axis points along the @xmath15-axis . blocks belonging to @xmath121 can be further decomposed into an even / odd block under reflection ( + /-",
    "radial matrix elements for rubidium as a function of the difference in principal quantum numbers @xmath122 ( for reasons of simplicity , only matrix elements with @xmath123 are shown ) .",
    "the value of the matrix elements decreases rapidly with @xmath122 .",
    "this facilitates restriction of the basis set by means of the principal quantum number.[fig : matrixelements ] ]    in the previous sections , we established the hamiltonian of two interacting rydberg atoms and explained how matrix elements of the hamiltonian can be calculated using [ sec : radial ] and [ sec : angularmatrixelements ] .",
    "this allows us to compute the matrix representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate pair potentials of the unperturbed state @xmath118 by numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix for a range of interatomic distances .",
    "then , the eigenenergies are plotted versus the distances to make up the pair potentials . by drawing lines between the eigenenergy points for which",
    "the overlap between the eigenvectors is maximal , we extract the pair potential curves .",
    "the overlap between an eigenvector and the unperturbed state tells the probability to find the unperturbed state on the corresponding pair potential curve .    in order to make the diagonalization of the hamiltonian computationally feasible",
    ", we have to keep the matrix size small .",
    "therefore , it is important to exploit conservation laws . as discussed in section [ sec : conservations ] , the hamiltonian might conserve several quantum numbers and symmetries , leading to a block diagonal structure of the hamiltonian matrix , see figure [ fig : matrixelements ] .",
    "each block can be diagonalized independently , which leads to a massive speed - up as the computation of all eigenpairs of a @xmath124-matrix costs @xmath125 floating - point operations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we diagonalize only those blocks that belong to the unperturbed state we are interested in . in addition , we have to restrict the basis to states having a significant influence on the pair potentials of the unperturbed state .",
    "hereto , we have several possibilities .",
    "first , we can restrict the basis to elements with similar energies as the unperturbed state .",
    "second , it is often useful to constrain the momentum quantum numbers because interaction of high order is required to change the momentum quantum numbers by large values .",
    "however , this constraint does not work if states involved in the high order interaction are degenerate as it is the case for stark map calculations .",
    "third , we can constrain the principal quantum number . if two states do not have similar principal quantum numbers , their radial matrix elements and",
    "hence their interaction is negligible , see figure [ fig : matrixelements ] .",
    "higher order interactions , which would only require matrix elements with similar principal quantum numbers , would also be weak as the required order increases with the principal quantum number .",
    "how the constraints should be chosen depends on many factors like the considered distances , the required accuracy , the quantum numbers of the unperturbed states , the order of the multipole expansion , external fields , and the atomic species .",
    "thus , giving the right constraints is difficult a priori .",
    "in fact , the constraints have to be tested for each calculation . for obtaining a small basis size ,",
    "we start with strong constraints and loosen them systematically until the pair potentials of the unperturbed state have converged within the distance threshold we are interested in .",
    "the convergence is extensively discussed in @xcite .    for calculating pair potentials in the presence of external electromagnetic fields ,",
    "the following approach has turned out to be useful : we construct a single - atom basis and calculate the atom - field hamiltonian for each of the two atoms independently .",
    "we enlarge the basis sets until the stark / zeeman maps have converged .",
    "we combine the eigenstates of the single - atom hamiltonians into pair states and obtain a pair basis that is suitable for establishing the total hamiltonian including atom - atom interactions .",
    "the combined eigenenergies , that are the stark / zeeman energies of the pair states , are located on the diagonal of the hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure has the advantage , that we can now restrict the pair basis to the states relevant for the atom - atom interaction without losing accuracy in the treatment of the electromagnetic fields . constraining the pair basis stronger than the single - atom basis is appropriate , in particular because the atom - field interaction typically couples over larger energy ranges than the atom - atom interaction .",
    "furthermore , whereas atom - field interactions might change energies drastically , the small amount of admixed states is irrelevant for the atom - atom interaction in many cases of practical relevance . despite these actions , the inclusion of electromagnetic fields can drastically increase the computational cost .",
    "depending on the type of field , the block structure of the hamiltonian matrix is destroyed .",
    "in this section , we discuss two examples of the rydberg potential calculation with relevance to recent experiments .",
    "comparison with experimental results enables us to validate our numerical results and demonstrate the applicability of full potential calculations to state - of - the - art experiments .",
    "it also allows us to benchmark the influence of the basis size and of the truncation order on the interaction potentials .",
    "the relevance of multipole terms in the interaction potential of order higher than dipole - dipole , i.e. @xmath126 in equation ( [ eqn : multipoleorder ] ) , has been highlighted in several recent experiments  @xcite . as an example , we focus here on the observation of rydberg aggregation dynamics in a vapor cell at room temperature by urvoy _",
    "_ @xcite . in this experiment",
    ", the high atomic densities and the spectral width of the laser pulses allow to probe rydberg interaction at short interatomic distances , with one key finding being that the correlated excitation of rydberg atoms is driven by the dipole - quadrupole ( @xmath127 ) contribution to the interaction .",
    "specifically , in the experiment , rydberg excitation in a cesium vapor cell is driven by two - photon excitation with red detuning @xmath128 relative to the @xmath129 rydberg state .",
    "the pure van - der - waals interaction potential resulting from dipole - dipole coupling of two atoms in this state is repulsive , see figure  [ fig : cs32s ]  , suggesting that the presence of one rydberg atom does not increase the excitation probability of further rydberg atoms by the red - detuned driving lasers .",
    "however , including the dipole - quadrupole interaction ( @xmath127 ) results in admixture of the @xmath130 pair state into several close - lying , attractively interacting pair states ( such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : cs32s ]  .",
    "as done in @xcite , we quantify the admixture of , for example , @xmath133 to any rydberg pair state @xmath134 by @xmath135 .",
    "any such admixture at detuning @xmath136 results in efficient optical excitation of additional rydberg atoms at specific distances to a first seed excitation .",
    "in particular , urvoy _",
    "_ identified the resulting resonance at @xmath137 ( where @xmath138 is the le  roy radius ) , which is reproduced by our calculations , as the dominant underlying mechanism for the correlated rydberg aggregation observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "based on this finding , an obvious question is how additional multipole orders further modify the interaction potential . in figure",
    "[ fig : cs32s ]  , we show the resulting potential map when the @xmath139 terms , corresponding to quadrupole - quadrupole and dipople - octupole interactions , are included",

    "thus , the quantitative differences in the potential landscape due to the next higher - order terms do not affect the conclusions in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the features at small distances are relevant for example for formation of bound pair states of rydberg atoms  @xcite , requiring inclusion of even further orders in the calculation @xcite . in general , when increasing @xmath146 , care has to be taken that the pair state basis truncation is appropriately adapted to include enough coupled states . in this example",

    "( springer )",
    "in the appendix , we briefly review the required steps to assemble the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) for the interaction potential calculation . as discussed in section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] , this requires the rydberg level energies ( [ eq : rydberglevelenergy ] ) , and the matrix elements of the single - atom electric multipole operators ( [ eqn : sphericalmultipole ] ) .",
    "exact calculations of both the energy spectrum and electron wave functions are possible only for the hydrogen atom .",
    "we consider rydberg atoms with a single electron in a highly excited state ( principal quantum number @xmath186 ) , which behave very similar to hydrogen , since the rydberg electron is effectively bound to a core with charge number @xmath187 , consisting of the actual nucleus ( with charge @xmath188 ) and @xmath189 inner electrons screening the core charge .",
    "this results in expressions for the rydberg level series which are only slightly modified from the well - known hydrogen result and there exist relatively simple approaches to calculating single - electron wave functions that capture the physics of rydberg atoms very well .",
    "the reduction to a single - electron problem is particularly justified for the alkali atoms , because of the closed - shell structure of the inner electrons .",
    "but for sufficiently large @xmath67 this treatment also works well for other atomic species , such as the noble gases @xcite , the alkaline earth metals @xcite , and even the lanthanides  @xcite .",
    "we consider rydberg states including spin - orbit coupling , because the fine - structure of rydberg states with low angular momentum @xmath190 is well resolved in current experiments on interacting rydberg atoms .",
    "the rydberg levels are specified by the quantum numbers of the single rydberg electron , namely @xmath67 ( principal quantum number ) , @xmath190 ( orbital angular momentum ) , @xmath191 ( total angular momentum ) , and @xmath192 ( magnetic quantum number ) .",
    "we neglect the hyperfine splitting caused by the coupling of the electron angular momentum @xmath193 to the nuclear spin @xmath194 . although experiments are now resolving hyperfine levels of low-@xmath190 rydberg states up to very high principal quantum numbers @xmath195  @xcite , the typical splitting @xmath196 for @xmath197  @xcite makes the hyperfine level structure ( so far ) irrelevant for rydberg interactions .",
    "the energy of rydberg levels of other species can be concisely written in analogy to the rydberg expression for hydrogen as @xmath198 here , @xmath199 is an effective , non - integer principal quantum number , which contains the species - dependent deviation from hydrogen , while @xmath200 is the modified rydberg constant taking into account the species dependent mass @xmath201 of the atomic core .",
    "the effective quantum number is found to depend only weakly on @xmath67 , but is mainly determined by the orbital angular momentum @xmath190 .",
    "more specifically , the energies of the rydberg series can be parameterized by introducing the quantum defects @xmath202 , which in turn are written as a series expansion of the form @xmath203 the coefficients in this polynomial expression are obtained from fits to experimentally measured transition energies for specific species . the fine - structure splitting is usually included in the quantum defects , which results in them depending on the quantum number @xmath193 .",
    "the quantum defects decrease rapidly with increasing orbital angular momentum @xmath190 , since for high-@xmath190 states the influence of the non - hydrogenic core on the single rydberg electron orbit becomes less relevant .",
    "thus , quantum defects have been experimentally determined for rydberg states with low orbital angular momentum @xmath190 , with the most precise data being available for the alkali atoms .",
    "table  [ tab : qdefects ] lists the references for the coefficients of the quantum defects for the alkalis used for the calculations in this tutorial .",
    "these quantum defects are also implemented by default in our software , but can be replaced or extended by new values .",
    "the accuracy of the quantum defects used to compute the potential energies of rydberg states is a key element to the precise determination of rydberg interaction potentials .",
    "note that the closed - form expression  [ eq : quantumdefect ] is motivated by , but differs from the analytic result obtained in quantum - defect - theory @xcite by the fact that @xmath204 appears in the higher - order terms instead of @xmath19 .",
