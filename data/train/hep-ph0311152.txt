    "we are much intersted in events with high multiplicity at rhic , where thousands of particles are produced per event .",
    "to describe such many particle system , a sort of collective approach will be useful .",
    "one - particle rapidity or pseudo - rapidity distributions observed at rhic are well described by the ornstein - uhlenbeck process with two or three sources  @xcite . in this paper , we would extend our approach to include an expansion for transverse direction .",
    "we can derive the formula same with that proposed by voloshin  @xcite from the three - dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck process using the variables , longitudinal rapidity and two transverse momenta .",
    "the fundamental solution is gaussian in these variables .",
    "even if the formula is integrated over the azimuthal angle in the transverse momentum plane , the distribution is only slightly modified from the gaussian .",
    "however , observed @xmath0 distributions at rhic have long tails compared with an exponential distribution , and can not be described by the formula",
    ". therefore relativistic approach , in other words , a stochastic model in the three dimensional hyperbolic space is adopted for the production processes , and @xmath0 distributions observed at rhic are analysed by the model .",

    "then those particles propagate according to the diffusion equation ( [ eq.dif3 ] ) . in the course of the space - time development ,",
    "energy is supplied from the leading particle system ( composed of collided nuclei ) to the produced particle system .",
    "number density of particles becomes lower and at some ( critical ) density particles become free .",
    "approximate solution of eq.([eq.dif3 ] ) for @xmath10 is given as  @xcite @xmath11 , \\nonumber \\\\",
