    "consider an isolated cylinder filled with an ideal gas and divided into two compartments by a large piston which is free to move along the axis of the cylinder , fig .  1 .",
    "the piston interacts with the gas atoms via elastic collisions .",
    "assume that the gas in each compartment separately is at equilibrium with temperature and density @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "let the gases exert equal pressures on the piston , i.e.let @xmath2 then the system is at the so called _ mechanical equilibrium _ , and according to the laws of thermodynamics this state should be ( macroscopically ) stable .    however , the system as a whole is not in a true equilibrium state , unless @xmath3 , hence microscopically it is not stable yet and should find ways to evolve to a true , _ thermal _ equilibrium , in which @xmath4 .",
    "this was predicted earlier by landau and lifshitz @xcite , feynman @xcite and others .",
    "recently gruber , piasecki and frachebourg and others @xcite derived heuristically , by means of kinetic theory , exact formulas describing the slow drift of the piston and the slow heat transfer from the hotter gas to the cooler gas .    our goal is to derive rigorously the main formulas of @xcite describing the slow drift of the piston and the slow heat transfer between the gases .",
    "the piston model trivially reduces to a one - dimensional system by the projection onto the axis of the cylinder .",
    "then one obtains an ideal gas on an interval , and the piston itself becomes a heavy point particle .",
    "the motion of a heavy particle in an infinite ideal gas of light particles is a classical example of brownian motion studied by van kampen @xcite and many others @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ideal gas on the entire line , without boundaries .",
    "the heavy piston is initially placed at the origin @xmath5 and is at rest @xmath6 .",
    "the initial configuration of gas atoms and their velocities is chosen at random as a realization of a ( two - dimensional ) poisson process on the @xmath7-plane with density @xmath8 .",
    "this means that for any domain @xmath9 the number @xmath10 of gas particles @xmath11 at time @xmath12 is a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath13 the system evolves according to the rules of elastic collisions . denote the mass of the piston by @xmath14 and the mass of an atom by @xmath15 .",
    "since atoms have identical masses , their collisions can be ignored .",
    "when an atom with velocity @xmath16 collides with the piston , whose velocity is @xmath17 , their velocities after the collision are given by v^= v + v [ v ] v^= - v + v [ v ] these rules preserve the total kinetic energy and the total momentum . between collisions , all the particles and the piston move with constant velocities .",
    "the position @xmath18 and velocity @xmath19 of the piston make a random process whose characteristics are determined by the initial gas density @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath8 is symmetric in @xmath16 and spatially homogeneous , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we can set @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a probability density and @xmath24 is a ( constant ) spatial density .",
    "then one can approximate @xmath18 and @xmath25 by certain gaussian stochastic processes :    let the density @xmath26 have a finite fourth moment @xmath27 .",
    "then for every finite @xmath28 , the function @xmath29 on the interval @xmath30 $ ] converges , in distribution , as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , to an ornstein - uhlenbeck velocity process @xmath33 , while @xmath34 converges to an ornstein - uhlenbeck position process @xmath35 .",
    "[ tmh ]    an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath36 is defined by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are constants and @xmath40 a wiener process .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck position process @xmath35 converges in an appropriate limit ( e.g.  @xmath41 , @xmath42const ) to a wiener process .",
    "we note that drr et al @xcite extended the above theorem to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "our paper concerns with another physically interesting situation , where the initial density is _ not _ spatially homogeneous , but a spatial homogeneity is assumed separately for the gases to the right and to the left of the piston .",
    "so we assume that @xmath43 and we also assume symmetry : @xmath44 and @xmath45 . we can set @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are probability densities and @xmath48 are ( constant ) spatial densities .",
    "in addition , we want to exclude macroscopic motion of the piston in either direction . the macroscopic velocity of the piston vanishes if and only if n_-",
    "v^2f_-(v ) dv = n_+ _ 0^ v^2f_+(v ) dv [ v=0 ] as it was shown heuristically in @xcite and under some conditions rigorously in @xcite . the physical interpretation of eq.([v=0 ] ) is the pressure balance .",
    "if we define the pressures of the gases by @xmath49 ( which would be a proper thermodynamical pressure if the velocity distributions were maxwellian ) , then the condition ( [ v=0 ] ) means exactly that @xmath50 .    to simplify some technical considerations we assume that the initial densities of the gases satisfy the following _ velocity cutoff _ :",
    "p_(v ) = 0 , |v| v_min |v| v _ [ cutoff ] for some @xmath51 . hence",

    "we also discuss in section  [ secjma ] how to relax these assumptions , leaving this work for the future .",
    "our cutoff condition ( [ cutoff ] ) has an important implication .",
    "as long as the speed of the piston remains small enough , every gas atom collides with the piston at most once .",
    "indeed , let @xmath52 , where @xmath53 note that @xmath54 is close to @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "then it follows directly from ( [ cutoff ] ) and ( [ v ] ) that the atoms velocities after collisions are at least @xmath57 the last equality holds due to our choice of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the atoms after collisions remain faster than the piston , so the latter can not `` catch up '' with them .    hence , as long as @xmath58 , the velocity of the piston @xmath25 evolves as a markov process with piecewise constant trajectories ( a jump or step process ) .",
    "moreover , this is a stationary ( homogeneous in time ) markov process due to our requirements on the density @xmath8 .",
    "we will slightly change the function @xmath25 so that it will evolve as a stationary markov process unconditionally .",
    "fix some @xmath59 and require that whenever the velocity @xmath60 of the piston after a collision , in the notation of ( [ v ] ) , exceeds @xmath61 in absolute value , it gets `` reflected '' at @xmath61 , i.e.  it instantaneously changes from @xmath60 to @xmath62 by the rules    lcl v>+|v & & v=+2|v - v + v<-|v & & v=-2|v - v    these rules are in the spirit of random walks with reflecting boundary conditions .",

    "therefore , the probability that @xmath73 is ( u,\\{u};t)= ( -_dp(x , v ) dx dv ) [ pww ] to evaluate this integral , we partition the domain @xmath74 into two trapezoids , @xmath75 as shown on fig .  2 .",

    "the invariance of the measure @xmath84 implies e(u , t ) d_0(u ) = w d_0(w ) [ mart ] now suppose that e(u , t ) = u + g(u)t + r(u , t ) [ eg ] so that @xmath115 substituting this into ( [ mart ] ) and taking the limit as @xmath116 gives g(u ) d_0(u ) = 0 [ g0 ]    our next step is to derive ( [ eg ] ) for small @xmath69 and compute @xmath117 explicitly .",
    "let @xmath118 and @xmath114 .",

    "now it is easy to see that the piston experiences at most one collision during the interval @xmath72 .",

    "thus , the average velocity of the piston is given by w= [ w0 ]    the mechanical equilibrium is defined by the equality of pressures on both sides of the piston , i.e.  by @xmath132 and we will restrict ourselves to this case in the rest of the paper .",
    "then ( [ w0 ] ) reduces to w= [ w00 ] which is still different from zero , albeit very small .",
    "it is well known that at mechanical equilibrium the average value of @xmath133 is @xmath134 , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but we will estimate it more accurately below .    similarly to @xmath125 , we define @xmath135 the conditional expectation of the square velocity @xmath136 given that @xmath114 .",

    "the equation ( [ g2 ] ) gives @xmath145 for brevity , we denote @xmath146 . by making",
    "one step further and analyzing @xmath147 in the same manner one can see that @xmath148 , we omit details",
    ". hence we arrive at w^2= + o ( ^2 ) [ w20 ] substituting this into ( [ w00 ] ) yields w= + o ( ^2 ) [ w000 ]",
    "in this section we express our rigorous results in statistical mechanical terms , such as temperature , density , pressure , and heat transfer .",
    "first , we consider the heat flow across the piston , from right to left . even though both gases are infinite , the heat transfer from one to the other is well defined and its rate can be computed .",
    "the thermodynamical definition of the heat transfer @xcite is r_+- = de_-/dt- dm_-/dtw [ heatd ] where @xmath149 is the rate of change of kinetic energy and @xmath150 the rate of change of momentum on the left hand side . by the conservation of energy and momentum during collisions ,",
    "it is enough to compute the average change of energy and momentum of the piston when it collides with an atom on the left hand side .    according to ( [ v ] ) , the momentum of the piston at one collision changes by @xmath151 the conditional average change of momentum during the interval @xmath72 , given that @xmath114 , is @xmath152 where only collisions with atoms on the left are taken into account .",
    "negating and averaging with respect to the stationary measure @xmath84 gives the average momentum transfer to the left gas : dm_-/dt = -2 m [ f_2 ^ - - 2f_1 ^ -w+ f_0 ^ -w^2 ] + o(m^2/m ) [ dm- ] by squaring ( [ v ] ) we find the change of the kinetic energy of the piston at one collision : @xmath153 where only essential terms are shown ( the rest will eventually end up in @xmath154 in the expression ( [ de- ] ) below , so we omit them ) . the conditional average change of kinetic energy during the interval @xmath72 , given that @xmath114 , is ( again only collisions with atoms on the left are taken into account ) @xmath155 negating and averaging with respect to the stationary measure @xmath84 gives the average kinetic energy transfer to the left gas : de_-/dt = -2 m [ f_3 ^ - + f_2 ^ -w - 2f_1 ^ -w^2 ]",
    "+ o(m^3/m^2 ) [ de- ]    combining ( [ dm- ] ) and ( [ de- ] ) we obtain the expression for the heat transfer r_+- = -2 m [ f_3 ^ - - 2f_1 ^ -w^2 ] + o(^2 ) [ heat ] substituting ( [ w20 ] ) gives r_+- = ( f_1^+f_3 ^ - - f_1 ^",
    "-f_3^+ ) + o(^2 ) [ heat0 ]    now , even though the thermodynamical temperatures of the gases are not defined , unless their velocity distributions are maxwellian , we can define the `` effective temperatures '' via the second moment of the velocity distributions : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we recall that the pressures of the gases are given by @xmath158 and their spatial densities by @xmath159 , hence the classical law @xmath160 holds .",
    "the piston s velocity distribution @xmath84 is , generally , not maxwellian , but its effective temperature can be computed similarly : @xmath161 where we used ( [ w20 ] ) and ( [ w000 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath162 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath163 , but for generic distributions @xmath164 there is no simple relation between the exact values of these temperatures .",
    "however , we can derive some interesting relations assuming that the distributions @xmath164 are maxwellian . since this would violate our assumptions ( [ cutoff ] ) , our further analysis is heuristic .",
    "assume that the densities @xmath164 satisfy @xmath165 where @xmath166 are ( constant ) spatial densities and @xmath167 the maxwellian distributions with temperatures @xmath168 .",
    "as before , we assume that the pressures are equal , i.e.  @xmath169 .",
    "it is then easy to compute @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 now the effective temperature of the piston is t_m = = = [ ttt ] where we used the equality of the pressures .",
    "the average velocity of the piston is @xmath174 lastly , the heat transfer across the piston ( from right to left ) given by ( [ heat0 ] ) is now @xmath175 hence , the heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient , @xmath176 , and the heat conductivity is thus = [ kappa ] the formulas ( [ ttt])([kappa ] ) were obtained earlier in @xcite by means of kinetic theory .",
    "let us examine closely what happens when the pressures are equal , @xmath50 , but the temperatures are different . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath177 , i.e.  the gas on the left is cooler but denser and the gas on the right is hotter but sparser",
    ". then @xmath178 , i.e.",
    "the piston slowly drifts in the direction of the hotter gas . at the same time @xmath179 ,",
    "i.e.  the heat slowly flows from the hotter gas to the cooler gas .",
    "this demonstrates that the mechanical equilibrium is not a stable state .",
    "if our gases were finite , there would be a continuing evolution toward _ thermal equilibrium _ , in which the temperatures become equal , too .",
    "of course , this conclusion makes no sense in the idealized model of infinite gases .",
    "we note that the evolution of the system is somewhat counterintuitive . when the piston moves to the right , i.e.  @xmath180 , then by ( [ v ] ) the atoms on the right bounce off it with a higher speed and so gain energy , while the atoms on the left collide with the piston and slow down , hence lose some energy .",
    "when the piston moves to the left , i.e.@xmath181 , it is vice versa . since , on the average , the heat flows from right to left , one may conclude that the piston s movements to the left dominate .",
    "on the other hand , the piston slowly drifts to the right , so its displacements in that direction actually dominate .    to explain this `` paradox '' , we first recall that the average speed of the piston is of order @xmath182 , which is much larger than the speed of the drift @xmath183 .",
    "hence the piston jiggles back and forth much faster than it drifts in one direction .",
    "the heat flow is due to `` jiggling '' rather than `` drifting '' .",
    "indeed , when the piston jiggles to the right , the slow atoms on the left have less chance to collide with the piston , since the relative velocity is small .",
    "most of the collisions between the slow atoms on the left and the piston occur when the latter jiggles to the left .",
    "this is why the cooler atoms speed up and gain energy , on the average . on the other hand ,",
    "the hotter atoms on the right are less sensitive to the variations in the piston s velocity , and the reason why they cool down is different , as we explain next .",
    "the piston s vibrations are not spatially symmetric . during excursions to the right , relatively few collisions with atoms on the right occur , since they are more energetic and able to quickly reverse the velocity of the piston . on the contrary ,",
    "when the piston drifts to the left , the atoms on the left are weak and it takes them longer to turn the piston back to the right . during these intervals ,",
    "the fast atoms on the right continue hitting the piston and lose energy .",
    "this explains why the hotter atoms mostly slow down .",
    "we must admit though that the precise mechanism of the heat flow across the piston in our model remains unclear .",
    "some physicists call it a `` conspiracy '' between the microscopic vibrations of the piston and the incoming atoms of the gases @xcite .",
    "here we estimate the difference between the true velocity of the piston @xmath25 and our markov approximation @xmath63 .",
    "recall that @xmath184 , i.e. the typical speed of the piston ( in the markov approximation ) is of order @xmath185 .",
    "the following theorem , which is essentially proved in @xcite ( see remarks below ) , estimates large deviations of the true velocity @xmath25 :      this gives a good bound on large deviations during time intervals of length @xmath190 for any large but fixed constant @xmath191 : it shows that the true velocity @xmath25 of the piston remains @xmath192 with `` overwhelming '' probability .",
    "therefore , during time intervals of length @xmath190 for any fixed constant @xmath191 , the true velocity @xmath25 of the piston coincides with its markov approximation @xmath63 with `` overwhelming '' probability .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath63 differ , though , then we have an obvious bound : @xmath197 .",
    "so we obtain analogues of our main formulas ( [ w000 ] ) and ( [ w20 ] ) :      it follows from the results of @xcite that whenever the true velocity @xmath25 exceeds @xmath202 , then with `` overwhelming '' probability it will be driven back toward zero by further collisions with the gas atoms .",
    "hence , the estimates of the last corollary should remain true for all @xmath102 , but we do not pursue such a goal , because the drift of the piston becomes evident on the time scale of order @xmath203 already for @xmath204 , as we show next , so the estimates in corollary  [ crevvv ] are sufficient for practical purposes .    indeed ,",
    "let @xmath5 and consider the random position of the piston @xmath18 at time @xmath101 .",
    "also , let @xmath205 be the corresponding function in the markov approximation model .",
    "we obviously have y(t)= tw= t + o ( ^2 t ) [ ey1 ] we also need to estimate the variance of @xmath206 , which is a little harder . we claim that [ y(t ) ] d t [ ey2 ] with some constant @xmath39 independent of @xmath194 .",
    "below we outline the argument , suppressing some technical details that are based on the estimates obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is standard that @xmath207 = \\int_0^t\\int_0^t{\\rm cov}(w(s),w(u))\\ , ds\\ , du\\ ] ] by the stationarity of the process @xmath63 , the covariance here equals @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the correlation between @xmath210 and @xmath211 , which only depends on @xmath212 .",
    "also recall that @xmath213 therefore , [ y(t ) ] t _ 0^t _ s ds [ vary ] it remains to estimate the decay of the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath214 .",
    "suppose during the interval @xmath215 the piston experiences @xmath216 collisions with gas atoms with velocities @xmath217 numbered in the order in which the collisions occur .",
    "then ( [ v ] ) implies w(u+s)=(1-)^k w(u ) + _ j=1^k ( 1-)^k - j v_j [ main ] where @xmath218 .",
    "this equation can be easily verified by induction on @xmath216 .",
    "now , the number of collisions @xmath216 grows as const@xmath219 , on the average , in fact p(|k - c_1s| c_2s ) s^2 ^-d [ ks ] with some positive constants @xmath220 , see @xcite . for @xmath221",
    "this gives a good bound on large deviations , so we can safely assume that @xmath222 .",
    "next , the velocities @xmath223 are almost independent of @xmath211 .",
    "in fact , there is a dependence , since the time of collision between a particular atom and the piston depends on the velocity of the latter , but the correlation between @xmath211 and velocities @xmath224 for every fixed @xmath225 is negative .",
    "this follows from a simple observation : if @xmath226 , the piston is more likely to collide with atoms on the right , for which @xmath227 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , the correlation @xmath214 is determined by the first term in ( [ main ] ) , hence @xmath228 this implies @xmath229 and combining with ( [ vary ] ) proves ( [ ey2 ] ) .",
    "the estimates ( [ ey1 ] ) and ( [ ey2 ] ) show that the piston s displacement due to the drift exceeds its typical random fluctuations at times @xmath230 for all @xmath204 . on such time",
    "scales the drift is `` physically evident '' and it is possible to verify it experimentally .",
    "numerical experiments of this sort were done by @xcite .",
    "we now comment on the proofs of theorem  [ tmvt ] and the estimate ( [ ks ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results were proven in @xcite in a slightly different context . that paper dealt with a heavy piston in a cubical container of side @xmath231 filled by an ideal gas .",
    "that model , too , reduced by a trivial projection onto the axis perpendicular to the piston surface to a one - dimensional gas on an interval @xmath232 $ ] .",
    "the velocity cutoff assumptions in @xcite were identical to our ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "the piston had mass @xmath233 ( @xmath38 was a constant ) and the spatial density of the one - dimensional gases was proportional to @xmath233 , but a simple rescaling of time and space by @xmath14 reduces the spatial density to values @xmath234 and makes it independent of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , we arrive exactly at the same initial conditions as in the present paper , except the gases in @xcite were finite  they evolved on an interval @xmath235 $ ] with the piston initially placed at @xmath5 .    due to the velocity cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) the gas atoms in @xcite can not interact with the piston more than once unless they travel across the half interval @xmath235 $ ] , reflect at an endpoint @xmath236 and then travel back to the piston in the middle .",
    "this takes time @xmath237 , as it was proven in @xcite .",
    "thus , during the initial interval @xmath238 with @xmath239 the evolution of the piston studied in @xcite is identical to ours .",
    "hence , all the results and estimates derived in section  3 of @xcite directly apply to our present context . furthermore , with some minor obvious changes those results can be extended to arbitrary time intervals as we did in theorem  [ tmvt ] and ( [ ks ] ) .",
    "lastly , we have assumed the velocity cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) here and in the paper @xcite mostly for convenience .",
    "it might be true that the upper bound on velocities is quite essential in @xcite , since arbitrarily fast atoms could bounce back and forth between the piston and the wall many times during short time intervals thus making significant impact on the piston , as it was remarked in section  5 of @xcite .",
    "but in the present work , if we had arbitrarily fast particles , they would hit the piston once and get away never to come back , so their impact would be quite limited .    as for the lower bound on velocities , it seems to be less essential in both models .",
    "it was conjectured in section  5 of @xcite that the results of that paper could be extended to velocity distributions without lower bounds ( i.e.  with @xmath240 ) .",
    "if so , then the estimate in theorem  [ tmvt ] implies that the typical velocity of the piston remains of order @xmath241 .",
    "as long as this is true , only atoms with smaller velocities can experience two or more collisions with the piston , thus violating the markovian character of the piston s velocity process @xmath25 .",
    "it is customary to redefine the dynamics so that the collisions with slow atoms are ignored altogether , and then the resulting process @xmath63 will be markovian . the difference @xmath242 should be estimated separately and presumably is negligible .",
    "such a strategy was successfully implemented in earlier works @xcite in somewhat different context , and it is likely to go through in our case as well .",
    "this is the subject of our future work .",
