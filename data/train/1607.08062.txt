    "over the past 70 years , there have been multiple attempts to dynamically model the movement of polymer chains with brownian dynamics  @xcite , which have more recently been used as a model for dna filament dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one of the first and simplest descriptions was given as the rouse model  @xcite , which is a bead - spring model  @xcite , where the continuous filament is modelled at a mesoscopic scale with beads connected by springs .",
    "the only forces exerted on beads are spring forces from adjacent springs , as well as gaussian noise .",
    "hydrodynamic forces between beads and excluded volume effects are neglected in the model in favour of simplicity and computational speed , but the model manages to agree with several properties of polymer chains from experiments  @xcite .",
    "other models exist , for example the zimm model introduces hydrodynamic forces  @xcite between beads , or bending potentials can be introduced to form a wormlike chain and give a notion of persistence length  @xcite , see , for example , review article  @xcite or books  @xcite on this subject .",
    "most of the aforementioned models consider the filament on only a single scale . in some applications ,",
    "a modeller is interested in a relatively small region of a complex system .",
    "then it is often possible to use a hybrid model which is more accurate in the region of interest , and couple this with a model which is more computationally efficient in the rest of the simulated domain  @xcite .",
    "an application area for hybrid models of polymer chains is binding of a protein to the dna filament , which we study in this paper . the model which we have created uses rouse dynamics for a chain of dna , along with a freely diffusing particle to represent a binding protein .",
    "as the protein approaches the dna , we increase the resolution in the nearby dna filament to increase accuracy of our simulations , whilst keeping them computationally efficient .",
    "in this paper we use the rouse model for analysis due to its mathematical tractability and small computational load .",
    "such a model is applicable to modelling dna dynamics when we consider relatively low resolutions , when hydrodynamic forces are negligible and persistence length is significantly shorter than the kuhn length between each bead  @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when we consider dna modelling at higher spatial resolutions .",
    "inside the cell nucleus , genetic information is stored within strands of long and thin dna fibres , which are separated into chromosomes .",
    "these dna fibres are folded into structures related to their function .",
    "different genes can be enhanced or inhibited depending upon this structure  @xcite .",
    "folding also minimises space taken up in the cell by dna  @xcite , and can be unfolded when required by the cell for different stages in the cell cycle or to alter gene expression .",
    "the folding of dna occurs on multiple scales . on a microscopic scale ,",
    "dna is wrapped around histone proteins to form the nucleosome structure  @xcite .",
    "this in turn gets folded into a chromatin fibre which gets packaged into progressively higher order structures until we reach the level of the entire chromosome  @xcite .",
    "the finer points of how the nucleosome packing occurs on the chromatin fibre and how these are then packaged into higher - order structures is still a subject of much debate , with long - held views regarding mesoscopic helical fibres becoming less fashionable in favour of more irregular structures in vivo  @xcite .    in the most compact form of chromatin ,",
    "many areas of dna are not reachable for vital reactions such as transcription  @xcite .",
    "one potential explanation to how this is overcome by the cell is to position target dna segments at the surface of condensed domains when it is needed  @xcite , so that transcription factors can find expressed genes without having to fit into these tightly - packed structures .",
    "this complexity is not captured by the multiscale model of protein binding presented in this paper . however ,",
    "if one uses the developed refinement of the rouse model together with a more detailed modelling approach in a small region of dna next to the binding protein , then such a hybrid model can be used to study the effects of microscopic details on processes over system - level spatial and temporal scales .",
    "when taking this multiscale approach , it is necessary to understand the error from including the less accurate model in the hybrid model and how the accuracy of the method depends on its parameters .",
    "these are the main questions studied in this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmrbs ] , we introduce a multi - resolution bead - spring model which generalizes the rouse model . we also introduce a discretized version of this model which enables the use of different timesteps in different spatial regions . in section  [ section3 ]",
    ", we analyze the main properties of the multi - resolution bead - spring model .",
    "we prove two main lemmas giving formulas for the diffusion constant and the end - to - end distance .",
    "we also study the appropriate choice of timesteps for numerical simulations of the model and support our analysis by the results of illustrative computer simulations .",
    "our main application area is studied in section  [ section4 ] where we present and analyze a dna binding model .",
    "we develop a method to increase the resolution in existing segments on - the - fly using the metropolis - hastings algorithm . in section  [ secdiscussion ] ,",
    "we conclude our paper by discussing possible extensions of the presented multiscale approach ( by including more detailed models of dna dynamics ) and other multiscale methods developed in the literature .",
    "we generalize the classical rouse bead - spring polymer model  @xcite to include beads of variable sizes and springs with variable spring constants . in definition",
