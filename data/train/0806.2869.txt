    "there has been an increasing interest in the last few years in the _ sign problem _ or _ phase problem _ in qcd @xcite . for a finite chemical potential , @xmath4 ,",
    "the fermion determinant matrix is non - positive definite , so it is not possible to perform monte carlo simulations in the usual fashion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the glasgow method @xcite and rewheighting techniques @xcite have provided great advances in the description of phase transitions on the lattice , considering a set of parameters near the transition line .",
    "there is special interest in the region of high temperature and low chemical potential , since it corresponds to the sector of the phase diagram of strong interactions probed by high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite . in this regime",
    "it is possible to expand the fermion determinant in powers of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is some mass scale related to the temperature , @xmath7 @xcite . in association with the ones mentioned previously , this technique is very convenient and successful to describe this region . besides , several other complementary approaches were proposed with the intent to shed some light on the sign problem @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the small chemical potential sector of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "in particular , we present a scheme that is valid for a wide range of temperatures in the soft region .",
    "methods that are based on an expansion in @xmath4 always have to resort to approximations to compute the coefficients of the series . for this purpose , there are numerical approximation techniques that yield good results but do not allow for a deeper analytic study , the most frequently used being the random noise method ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "analytic treatments are usually restricted to very high temperatures .",
    "for instance , the dimensional reduction effective action @xcite is valid for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the critical temperature . a complete study of the pressure within perturbative qcd for all values of the temperature and chemical potential can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors make use of the hard thermal loop , hard dense loop and dimensional reduction approximations .    here",
    "we start from a different perspective : instead of expanding all quantities and desired observables in powers of @xmath5 , the idea is to keep the relevant terms in the effective action according to the weinberg power counting criteria @xcite . in what follows we",
    "construct an effective action for qcd by expanding the quark determinant in powers of the chemical potential at finite temperature in the case of massless quarks .",
    "we compute the minimal effective action expanding in the external momentum up to order @xmath0 in power counting . in practice ,",
    "the momentum expansion performed here is equivalent to the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite .",
    "our main result is a gauge invariant expression for the phase angle @xmath10 of the functional determinant in qcd , which can be written as @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting analysis of the angle @xmath1 has been recently performed using the random matrix framework @xcite .    as a first test of our method",
    ", we recover the dimensional reduction approximation in the limit of high temperature . as a second step ,",
    "we compute analytically @xmath2 in the range of @xmath3 , keeping nonzero mode contributions in the effective action . in this calculation , we include perturbative and nonperturbative contributions , treating the latter in the mean field approximation .",
    "implications for lattice simulations are also discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we develop the general expansion for the fermionic determinant , present the feynman rules and the relevant diagrams , settling the framework . in sec .",
    "we discuss the power counting hierarchy in order to be able to cut the series and compute the minimal effective action . as a first test of our framework",
    ", we also reobtain the result from dimensional reduction in the limit of high temperature , including the non - zero mode terms . in section",
    "iv we present the calculation of @xmath2 in the range of @xmath3 .",

    "we can expand the fermion determinant in powers of the chemical potential assuming that @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the dressed fermion propagator , which can be expressed as a series in powers of the gauge field and the free fermion propagator using the self - consistent relation @xmath20 the expansion , then , will contribute to additional terms in the effective action @xmath21 .",
    "the new terms , expressed in momentum space , are of the form @xmath22 where the last integral denotes also the sum over bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in this way",
    ", one obtains a positive - definite fermion determinant , and the contribution from the chemical potential will be part of an effective gluon action .",
    "the feynman rules in momentum space for calculating the different effective vertices are almost the same as the usual ones .",
    "the difference is that all of the operators between chemical potential insertions must be transposed in order .",
    "figure [ gns1 ] shows a general diagram with chemical potential and gluon insertions . to construct a diagram for a vertex with @xmath25 gluons and @xmath26 chemical potential insertions",
    ", one puts @xmath27 for any gluon insertion , @xmath28 for any chemical potential insertion , and divides by the symmetry factor @xmath26 .    between chemical potential insertions , the order of the operator",

    "finally , one takes the trace over gamma matrices and color group representation , integrating over internal fermionic momentum ( odd matsubara frequencies ) .",
    "the sum of all diagrams will produce the effective vertices @xmath32 , which will be invariant under any cyclic change in the set of indices @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 in the case of configuration space ) .",
    "now , we need a criteria to cut the series . for low - energy effective theories , one can consider the weinberg power counting @xcite , which uses the argument that all mass parameters ( external momentum , chemical potential and gluon fields ) must be less than a certain scale that is proportional to the temperature .",
    "this approach has provided a very successful description within chiral effective models of qcd .",
    "although this is not exactly the case here , it is reasonable that for low - energy processes at high temperature typical values of the operators mentioned above , as well as the chemical potential , can be considered to be in a region of the same order or smaller than the scale .",
    "then , assuming @xmath37 , and expanding the effective lagrangean in soft modes , we can cut it at a given order in powers of the momentum scale .",
    "in the case of yang - mills theories , this soft - mode expansion for high temperatures corresponds to the htl approximation .",
    "the minimal action must be of order @xmath38 .",

    "the usual effective action for the high - temperature regime is constructed through loops integrating the @xmath59 fields . however , this is done perturbatively , and this is not the regime in which we are interested .",
    "the fact of including @xmath59 as a nonperturbative field ( except for the power counting ) in principle will enhance the range of validity in temperature to values lower than in the case of just considering an infinite temperature expansion . in this sense",
    ", our framework goes beyond dimensional reduction , and can probe temperatures closer to @xmath60 .",
    "the phase angle @xmath1 of the complex functional determinant is a crucial quantity for lattice simulations in qcd .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath1 allows for the separation of the functional integral into two different regions : @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless this is not a simple task , since it is not restricted to values of @xmath62 but seems to increase with the volume @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the average phase @xmath63 gives a measure of how problematic could be the phase in lattice simulations .",
    "as this quantity must vanish in the thermodynamic limit , it should be evaluated in a finite volume ( otherwise the average phase above vanishes as soon as @xmath4 is nonzero ) .",

    "( [ phaseaverage ] ) .",
    "if one expands the exponential in powers of the angle , the relevant term will be @xmath65 , since the average of the phase must be real .",
    "in particular , the determination of @xmath66 , the average of the angle as a function of the plaquette , is an important ingredient in order to localize the critical line in the temperature - number density phase diagram of qcd @xcite .    in our framework , we have @xmath67 . writing the fields in the form @xmath68 we can use eq . ( [ g31dimred ] ) to express @xmath1 in the high - temperature limit as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are real and totally symmetric as usual .",

    "the basic building blocks are the two - point functions for the field strengths , which we compute in the sequel .",

    "the last term is purely perturbative , whereas the other ones come from the mixed contribution .",
    "the purely nonperturbative contribution vanishes identically in the mean field approximation .",
    "notice that , in the thermodynamic limit , the dominant contribution is the one proportional to @xmath93 , so that @xmath77 grows faster than quadratically with the volume , the other contributions being essentially irrelevant .",
    "we presented a well - defined and systematic procedure for computing the fermionic determinant in qcd at finite temperature and chemical potential . in the framework defined by the power counting method described above",
    ", we calculated exactly the minimal corrections to the effective action .",
    "this procedure can be systematically extended to higher orders .",
    "we also computed explicitly @xmath77 in the high - temperature limit and analyzed its volume dependence . in this limit ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes naturally from the zero matsubara mode , so that dimensional reduction is a good approximation .",
    "although we do not present results beyond the mean field approximation for the gluon condensate , we expect that in that case , a new length scale associated with the nonuniformity of the condensate will compete with the scale @xmath90 but should not modify the picture appreciably in the limit considered in this work .",
    "in this paper we proposed a new way of approaching the problem of determining the phase of the complex functional determinant in qcd at small chemical potential and relatively large temperatures , an important issue for lattice qcd thermodynamics .",
    "our framework clearly contains , and goes beyond , the dimensional reduction approximation , being valid for temperatures closer to @xmath60 .",
    "we believe that this analysis , complemented by previous existing results , might shed some light onto the phase transition in the region of high temperature and low density presumably probed by relativistic heavy - ion experiments , and perhaps indicate a simple way to handle the sign problem for temperature values closer to the critical temperature .",
