    "we shall deal with the brownian motion described by the following langevin equation which is the same one in the previous work @xcite : @xmath0x(t ) = f(t ) \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a position of the brownian particle at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a damping constant per unit mass and @xmath4 is a centered gaussian - white noise with correlation function @xmath5 @xmath6 is a periodic function of @xmath7 whose maximum and minimum values are @xmath8 as defined in ref.@xcite . even if the period is not @xmath7 , we can obtain eq.([eq1 ] ) again by introducing scaled parameters . in the motion of a charged particle in a paul trap with buffer gas near standard temperature and pressure by arnold et al .",
    "@xcite , which is accurately modeled by this brownian motion , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq.([eq1 ] ) correspond to a dc and an ac voltage , respectively .",
    "it is reported in the previous paper @xcite that for a general periodic function @xmath6 , three variances in the long - time limit under the condition @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are governed by the deterministic equations , @xmath13 and @xmath14\\av{x}=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , these conditions are equivalent to @xmath15 at initial time .",
    "even if the initial conditions are not assumed , both @xmath16 and @xmath12 go to 0 in the long - time limit since we shall suppose that parameters which make this damped parametric oscillator stable in the long - time limit are selected . ]",
    "@xmath17 can be obtained analytically by using series of @xmath10 as long as @xmath18 holds .",
    "moreover , it is showed that as @xmath10 increases the mean square displacement ( msd ) can be suppressed less than that at @xmath19 , i.e. , msd of a brownian motion in a harmonic potential .",
    "we called this phenomenon a _ classical fluctuation squeezing_.    in the experiment with the paul trap , a static force produced by a dc voltage balances with gravity , which means that we should set @xmath20 in eq.([eq1 ] ) . for this case with @xmath20 , however , msd in the long - time limit can not be represented by a series of @xmath10 in @xcite , @xmath21 since the zeroth - order term diverges , which means that @xmath22 is a singular point of msd in the long - time limit .",
    "we can understand this from another point of view .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath23 denotes a free brownian motion .",
    "therefore , msd in the long - time limit goes to @xmath24 because of a well - known relation , @xmath25 . in short ,",
    "the theory about msd in the previous paper is right only for the case with @xmath18 and can not be used at @xmath20 .",
    "thus a new method is desired in order to solve the system with @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the asymptotic behavior of msd in the long - time limit near the singular point @xmath23 for general periodic functions , which is not taken up in the previous work .",
    "of course , investigations for this case have been done for the mathieu s case of @xmath26 @xcite , but there is no study dealing with the system with general periodic functions as far as we know .",
    "in fact , we will show that msd for other periodic functions can be smaller than that for the mathieu s case .",
    "this result will reveal a significance of employing other periodic functions in experiments using the paul trap with a buffer gas .",
    "here , we shall examine the periodicity of variances in the long - time limit which is a very important property when investigating the asymptotic behavior of msd .",
    "of course , the periodicity is clear in the previous paper @xcite , but the proof is valid as long as @xmath27 holds . the proof on this section remains true even if @xmath28 .",

    "we can find that the second term is also finite only if the eigenvalues fulfill the same condition as follows : @xmath45 in order that this sum of the matrix series converges , it is necessary that the absolute values of all eigenvalues of @xmath46 must be lower than 1 . by setting @xmath47 in eq.([eq4 ] )",
    ", one can see that the eigenvalues of @xmath46 and @xmath44 are equal . if the absolute values of all eigenvalues of @xmath44 are lower than 1 , this necessary condition is satisfied .",

    "we plot two coefficients in fig.[fig1 ] , from which one can see that the coefficient of a square wave is about half that of the mathieu s case .",

    "it turns out that the minimum for a square wave is 5.15 at @xmath124 and that for the mathieu s case is 5.25 at @xmath125 .",

    "are always lower than those for the mathieu s case . by setting @xmath128 , however , @xmath75 for the mathieu s case can be lower than that for a square wave as seen in fig.[fig11 ] , which arises from the fact that the range of @xmath10 which makes this system stable for a square wave is narrower than for the mathieu s case .     which represents a minimum value of @xmath75 vs @xmath127 which minimizes @xmath75 .",

    "we define a periodic function with @xmath91 in the first interval from @xmath129 to @xmath7 as follows : first , we form the positive part of this periodic function at @xmath130 from @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 is a non - negative function defined on @xmath134 whose maximum value is 1 .",
    "next , we form the negative part at @xmath135 from @xmath136 with @xmath137",
    ". then we join these two parts together , so that we can get the periodic function in the interval like this : @xmath138 in which @xmath139 is the heaviside s step function .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7-periodic function fulfilling the conditions mentioned at the beginning of this section is completed by connecting this segment repeatedly .    using the periodic function defined in this way",
    ", we derive @xmath140 here , we introduce the ratio of the time intervals of the two parts , @xmath141 , denoting the asymmetry of this periodic function .",

    "since @xmath108 must be positive , it is necessary that @xmath144 . from this equation",
    ", we can find that as @xmath145 decreases with fixing @xmath133 , which indicates that the asymmetry becomes extreme , @xmath108 becomes larger , which means that msd becomes reduced because of eq.([eqmainresult ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can reach a conclusion that the asymmetry suppresses the fluctuation of position for the case @xmath20 as well as the case @xmath18 reported in ref.@xcite .    as an example of such a periodic function we show an asymmetric cosine function @xmath146 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) which can be obtained by setting @xmath147 and inserting the negative part into the positive part divided equally .",

    "the circles represent numerical solutions for the mathieu s case .",
    "dashed lines represent asymptotic solutions described by eq.([eqmainresult ] ) for each case which coincide with numerical solutions at small @xmath10 .",
    "since the orders of the singular point are different between the two cases , these lines are crossing .    for small @xmath10 ,",
    "the difference between msd for an asymmetric cosine and for the mathieu s case is extreme .",
    "msd at @xmath153 is smaller than that at @xmath154 , which can be easily understood as follows : from eq.([eqc0 ] ) , @xmath108 decreases monotonically as @xmath145 increases .",

    "even if @xmath145 gets bigger , the large - and - small relation does not change : from numerical calculations , it is clarified that although @xmath145 varies up to 0.9 the minimum for an asymmetric cosine does not become more than that for the mathieu s case at the range of @xmath3 from 0.1 to 5.0 .",
