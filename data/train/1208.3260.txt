    "ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) , galaxies commonly observed at high redshifts with strong ly@xmath0  emission , are considered to be low - mass , young galaxies as suggested from their small sizes , faint continua , and low masses inferred from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "laes are therefore likely to represent galaxies in the early stages of galaxy evolution . more directly ,",
    "@xcite investigate rest - frame optical nebular lines of laes at low redshifts ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the authors find that a large portion of laes ( @xmath16% ) have equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath0  @xmath17 , and that laes on average have lower metallicities and younger ages than the uv - continuum sample .",
    "these findings are consistent with the idea that laes are galaxies in early stages of galaxy formation . at higher redshifts ,",
    "laes are efficiently detected thanks to narrowband imaging techniques which have enriched our knowledge about the younger universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , more direct evidence supporting the idea that high redshift laes are in an early evolutionary phase of formation is still needed .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity is a key property of galaxies , since it is a record of their star - formation histories .",
    "this physical quantity is relatively easily constrained with line ratios of nebular lines at rest - frame optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "another key quantity is the ionization parameter , defined as the ratio of the mean ionizing photon flux to the mean hydrogen atom density .",
    "since the excitation of the hii  region is sensitive to the age distribution of the exciting stars , the ionization parameter provides a rough estimate of age of a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a large ionization parameter is observed from a galaxy dominated with massive stars , which is a sign that the galaxy is in an early stage of galaxy formation .",
    "in addition , the ionization parameter depends on the optical depth in an hii  region ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; a large ionization parameter may be instead due to a low optical depth and a high escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "therefore , constraining ionization parameters for laes may provide an independent clue to whether or not laes , commonly observed star - forming galaxies at high redshift , significantly contribute to the cosmic reionization in the early universe .",
    "determining the ionization parameter requires two emission lines of different ionization stages of a same element , such as [ oii ]  and [ oiii ]  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , well - defined samples of laes are generally located at very high redshifts ( @xmath18 ) , where rest - frame optical nebular lines are redshifted into infrared wavelengths .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite instead take advantage of laes at moderately high redshifts ( @xmath9 ) , where the nebular lines up to h@xmath0  are observable from the ground in the near - infrared ( nir ) windows .",
    "these studies extend the metallicity censuses to galaxies with strong ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "@xcite obtain nir spectra for two @xmath19 laes , and find that at least one lae appears to be less chemically enriched than @xmath9 continuum - selected galaxies at similar stellar masses @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate average line fluxes for [ oii]@xmath20 and h@xmath0+[nii]@xmath21 for @xmath1 laes by stacking @xmath22 and @xmath23 m narrowband images for more than @xmath24 laes , and place a firm lower - limit for the average metallicity of this population .",
    "interestingly , the lower - limit is higher than expected for its stellar mass at the redshift .",
    "in contrast to the gas - phase metallicities , the ionization parameters of laes are unknown .",
    "such measurements have only been obtained for bright galaxies such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) or strongly lensed galaxies at high-@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the current number of measurements is small , ionization parameters of such high-@xmath2 galaxies are likely to be higher on average than those of local galaxies .",
    "a comparison of ionization parameters for lbgs and laes will enable us to discuss whether or not laes are young galaxies at high redshifts .    in order to obtain reliable measurements of properties including metallicity and ionization parameter of laes at high redshifts , we have carried out a large survey for @xmath1 laes , using our custom narrowband filter nb387 with subaru / suprime - cam . at @xmath1 , important nebular lines such as [ oii]@xmath20 , h@xmath25 , [ oiii]@xmath26 , h@xmath0 , [ nii]@xmath27 , are observable from the ground .",
    "initial results were based on using three narrowbands to detect ly@xmath0 , [ oii ] , and h@xmath0  over the same volumes ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for the two nir narrowbands and the newh@xmath0  survey ) .    in this paper , we present results from nir spectroscopy .",
    "we used keck / nirspec and magellan / mmirs spectrographs , and successfully detected h@xmath0  emission from seven laes .",
    "the number is double the previous number of high-@xmath2 laes with nir spectra ( two from @xcite and two from @xcite ) , and allows us to begin to examine statistical variation of rest - frame optical spectroscopic properties of laes at @xmath9 .",
    "our first nir spectroscopic result discusses the kinematics of laes and is presented in @xcite . as a companion study , this paper presents the ionization and chemical properties of laes based on multiple nebular lines .",
    "remarkably , we detected [ oii ]  and [ oiii ]  lines from two laes , which provide ionization parameter estimates for laes for the first time .",
    "in addition , the oxygen lines allow us to determine oxygen abundances that compliment the previous spectroscopic constraints on metallicity of laes from the [ nii]/h@xmath0   index .",
    "we also investigate ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0  hydrogen lines for laes .",
    "a comparison of observed ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratios with the case b recombination value ( ly@xmath0/h@xmath0   @xmath28 ; @xcite ) provides important insights into the physical mechanisms causing the strong ly@xmath0  emission in laes .",
    "furthermore , we study ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0  equivalent widths which probe star - formation history , stellar age , and metallicity .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the data in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the detection and measurement of emission lines in the nir spectroscopy is summarized in  [ sec : line_measure ] . in  [ sec : properties ] , we derive properties of laes including estimates of ionization parameter , metallicity , and sfr from the rest - frame optical nebular lines .",
    "we also check for the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the laes . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare laes with other galaxies in terms of their ionization state , metallicity , and sfr . we then discuss the implications .",
    "we also discuss the physical properties inferred from ly@xmath0   and h@xmath0  emission .",

    "the sky and oh - lines of an a - position image were roughly removed by subtracting an average b - position image created from the previous and following images .",
    "we then removed the residual sky by subtracting a @xmath141-th order polynomial fit in the spatial direction after masking columns of positive and negative parts caused by the alignment star and the object .",
    "individual images were shifted in spatial direction so that the object is in the same position both in a - position and b - position images .",
    "the offset values were derived from the position differences of the alignment stars . when no star was observed simultaneously , we defined the offset values as the nod separation size . finally , we stacked the position - matched individual images to create the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectra .",
    "we obtained flux solutions by comparing spectra of the a0v standard stars and a model , which was created by a stellar spectral synthesis program ( spectrum ; @xcite ) based on the @xcite s atmosphere models .",
    "the model spectra were then normalized so that their @xmath105 , @xmath104 , and @xmath103 band magnitudes matched with those of standard stars , whose photometry was obtained from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky point source catalog .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra were extracted by summing up @xmath142@xmath143 pixels in the spatial direction .",
    "the lengths of columns were determined based on the seeing conditions ; about two times the seeing size was used .",
    "we also confirmed that the sizes were large enough to detect most of the signal , and maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the 1d and 2d spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we note in addition that the science targets and the standard stars used for the flux calibrations were observed and reduced with almost the same conditions , thus effects of slit losses were also corrected in the procedures , since the standard spectra extracted in the procedure were normalized to have the total magnitude of that star .",
    "laes typically have half - light radii @xmath144kpc ( @xmath145 at @xmath1 ; @xcite ) , which is much smaller than the seeing size .",
    "therefore , we can not resolve laes with our observations , and assuming the psf profile for the laes is reasonable .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured by fitting a gaussian profile to each line with the iraf task ` splot ` .",
    "the sky noise level was estimated in the following manner ; we prepared an aperture box , which had approximately twice the seeing size in spatial direction and twice the fwhm of the best fit gaussian to the emission line in wavelength direction .",
    "we spread more than @xmath24 aperture boxes around the emission line after masking pixels heavily contaminated by oh - lines , and measured their photon counts .",
    "we then fit the histogram of the counts with a gaussian , and regarded its @xmath146 as the @xmath147 fluctuation for the aperture used to measure the emission line .",

    "both laes are expected to have strong ly@xmath0 , hence strong h@xmath0 . a possible reason why we do not detect lines for hhdfn-18431",

    "another interesting comparison is with the low - metallicity galaxies in the local universe .",

    "indeed , from the comparison between [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratios and photo - ionization models given in @xcite , it is inferred that local low - metallicity galaxies typically have higher ionization parameters ( @xmath422cms@xmath5 , or higher ) than more metal - rich galaxies seen in the sdss sample .",

    "their sfrs are also comparable to those for laes @xcite , in contrast with more modest sfrs seen in typical local low - metallicity galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a similar discussion is also provided by @xcite .    in the sdss date release 7 ( dr7 ) spectroscopic galaxy sample",

    "the number density of the gps is thus almost two order of magnitude smaller than that of laes .",
    "therefore , if the gps alone represent galaxies with high ionization parameter in the local universe , although it is still uncertain , the large difference of abundances between laes and the gps suggests that such galaxies appear to be much more abundant at high-@xmath2 while rarely seen in the local universe .",
    "the final noteworthy implication of the high ionization parameters found in high-@xmath2 laes is that such galaxies may provide additional photons that cause hydrogen reionization of the igm in the early universe .",

    "@xcite find that the universe could not be totally ionized by only galaxies at @xmath444 if there is no evolution of properties ( e.g. , escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath361 ) , metallicity , dust extinction ) from @xmath363 to @xmath444 .",
    "one approach to resolve the problem is to adopt larger @xmath361 , which may be the case for galaxies with higher ionization parameter . since lower ionization species such as [ oii ]  dominate in the outer regions of an usual , ionization - bounded hii  region ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", a density - bounded hii  region will show a larger [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratio .",

    "e.g. , @xcite calculate that in the condition of density bounding , an hii  region with @xmath361=@xmath445 shows the same ionization parameter as a region with @xmath446 greater ionizing flux without any photon escape .",
    "consequently , the high ionization parameters found in the laes may be due to a low optical depth and a high @xmath361 , probably achieved by density - bounded hii  regions .    although exact geometries of hii  regions in laes are sill uncertain , the lae s optically thin property has been suggested by recent studies .",
    "e.g. , @xcite investigate the kinematics of the galaxy scale outflows for laes using both ly@xmath0  emission and strong metal absorption lines , finding a tendency that laes have smaller values of neutral hydrogen column density in contrast with lbgs .",
    "theoretically , @xcite also suggest a completely ionized , optically thin phase can exist for laes . therefore , the high ionization parameters may suggest laes can possess higher @xmath361 , in contrast with lbgs showing modest fractions of photon escape .",
    "this trend is roughly consistent with the findings by @xcite that laes tend to show smaller observed ratios of non - ionizing uv to lyman continuum flux density than lbgs , as well as with the latest measurements of @xmath361s for both populations @xcite .",

    "we note in conclusion that if the photon escapes are non - zero , laes ionizing fluxes need not necessarily to be as hard as we expect for zero escape fraction . a hard ionizing photon flux ( young population ) , a high escape fraction of ionizing photons , or a combination of both conditions likely cause the high ionization parameters found in the laes .",

    "this trend indicates that star - formation activities are well determined by their stellar mass , irrespective of the presence of ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently find that laes tend to have higher sfr surface densities for their gas mass surface densities than `` normal '' star - forming galaxies including bzk galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : ew_lya_ha ] shows equivalent widths of ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0  for laes ( hereafter referred to as the `` ews diagram '' )",
    ". this plot may be useful to understand star - formation histories of laes , because the ews continuum fluxes evolve in different ways when different star - formation histories are assumed .",
    "another advantage of using the ews is that both are pure observables and to zeroth order independent of dust extinction ( the effect of dust will be discussed at the end of this section ) .",
    "the superposed curves on figure [ fig : ew_lya_ha ] illustrate evolutions of the ews for the two extreme star - formation histories , instantaneous burst ( dashed ) and constant star - formation ( solid ) at several metallicities @xcite ( @xmath340@xmath463 ) .",

    "for the instantaneous burst , since very massive stars ( @xmath468 ) complete their evolution within @xmath469myr , both ews decline rapidly . as a result ,",
    "their curves evolve quickly to lower - left on the ews diagram . for the constant star - formation , on the other hand , the ew(ly@xmath0 ) stops declining around @xmath12myr , because massive stars that are responsible for both ly@xmath0  emission and uv - continuum reach a steady mode .",
    "since the ew(h@xmath0 ) keeps declining as the older stars build up in the galaxy , their slopes of the evolutionary tracks become less steep on the ews diagram .",
    "although @xcite s calculations stop at @xmath470myr for constant star - formation , the ew(ly@xmath0 ) varies little after @xmath24myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tracks must extend to the left almost horizontally after the terminal points , reaching ew(h@xmath0 ) @xmath12   for the solar - metallicity case when an age of @xmath471gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) ) evolution with age until @xmath340gyr , we extend the evolution toward older age smoothly to obtain ew(h@xmath0 ) @xmath12  at @xmath471gyr .",

    "can be explained by the instantaneous burst models with very young ages ( a few myr ) .",
    "the other laes whose ew(h@xmath0 ) is modest appear to prefer the constant star - formation models with @xmath472myr .",
    "although the sample is small , we find more than half of the laes appear to need a continuous star - formation history rather than an instantaneous burst .",
    "note , however , that since the ews are sensitive to recent starbursts , laes on instantaneous tracks are not necessarily very young , but can be experiencing a burst after a continuous star - formation .",
    "such a combination of burst plus continuous star - formation is indeed needed to explain the ews of h@xmath0  and optical colors observed in local dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "an lae with such a combined star - formation history will be on a track of instantaneous burst during starburst phases and on a track of constant star - formation for the remaining time .",
    "similarly , most of @xmath457 laes appear to prefer continuous star - formation on the ews diagram .",
    "interestingly , @xmath9 laes appear to have systematically higher ew(ly@xmath0 ) and ew(h@xmath0 ) than lower-@xmath2 laes .",

    "this idea is supported by the inference of lower metallicities at higher-@xmath2 (  [ sssec : mzr ] ; see also e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , one worry on the use of the ews diagram is the effect of dust on ly@xmath0 .",
    "if the degree of dust extinction is different for ly@xmath0  and uv - continuum , ew(ly@xmath0 ) is no longer independent of dust extinction . in order to examine this effect",

    "the dark red symbols indicate the observed ly@xmath0  luminosity divided by the intrinsic h@xmath0  luminosity corrected using the attenuation inferred from the sed fitting ( i.e. , showing lower - limits on the @xmath309-axis ) , while the light red symbols show the observed ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratios . a trend that laes with larger ew(ly@xmath0 )",

    "this trend itself is not so surprising , but interestingly some laes , cosmos-08501 , and possibly cosmos-13636 and one lae at @xmath457 , may have ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratios exceeding the case b recombination value ( @xmath485 ; @xcite ) , which we call `` super case b ''",
    ". super case b ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratios have also been reported for some strong laes in the local universe ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the variation of the intrinsic ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio ( the gray shaded area ) does not seem to be a significant issue .",
    "although it is not obvious that super case b objects are really included in our sample due to their large errors , it is worth discussing possible physical origins of them in case they really exist .",
    "we consider the possible effect of geometry , and the kinematics of dust and gas in the ism . @xcite",
    "propose a clumpy , multi - phase ism where gas and dust are gathered in clouds within a low - density medium .",
    "with such circumstances , ly@xmath0  photons can be scattered at the surfaces of the clouds due to the resonant nature , while continuum photons would penetrate the clouds deeply . since dust",
    "is contained in the clouds , ly@xmath0  photons would have a much smaller chance of encountering dust than other photons . in this scenario , a large ew(ly@xmath0 ) and ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio can be observed .",
    "alternatively , an outflow of the ism can be a cause of strong ly@xmath0  emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite find an anti - correlation between ew(ly@xmath0 ) and ly@xmath0  velocity offset for laes , the latter is considered to be positively correlated with outflow velocity .",
    "this anti - correlation is also supported by the observations of lbgs ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the authors measure the laes outflow velocity directly from metal absorption lines , finding that outflow velocities for laes and lbgs are comparable .",
    "therefore , outflows do not appear to be a major mechanism for producing large ew(ly@xmath0 ) and ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio , though the sample size of laes is still small and much more data as well as theoretical works to interpret the properties are needed .    in order to clarify the effects of a potentially clumpy geometry of ism on ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratios , we plot in figure [ fig : fesc ] ( right )",

    "ssa22 - 8043 has a large @xmath378 parameter of @xmath492 , and can be an exception if its ly@xmath0  is heavily resonant - scatted by neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "a notable object is cosmos-08501 .",
    "it appears to fall above the @xmath491 line , where the clumpy ism model does not work assuming case b recombination , although the errors are relatively large .",
    "moreover , since it is inferred to possess relatively small amount of dust , the large ew(ly@xmath0 ) owing to the clumpy ism is unlikely . in case",
    "the object is really super case b , the only remaining explanation is the ly@xmath0  enhancement caused by collisional excitations . due to",
    "the decreasing collisional strengths with increasing principle quantum number , collisional excitations can lead to ly@xmath0/h@xmath0   ratios over the case b value ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "shocks caused by interactions with other sources , agn activity , supernova explosions , strong outflows or infall are possible candidates for the collisional excitations .    based on the hst images ( figure [ fig : acs_i ] ) , cosmos-08501",
    ", a super case b candidate , looks very compact and shows no sign of interactions .",
    "cosmos-13636 , which has a very small @xmath378 parameter , shows two faint sources nearby within @xmath493kpc ( projected ) from the object .",
    "its strong ly@xmath0   emission can be ( partly ) due to shocks caused by interactions .",
    "indeed , some fractions of laes are turned out to exhibit morphologies suggestive of mergers at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as lower redshift @xcite .",
    "theoretically , @xcite demonstrate that mergers play an important role in mass assembly and star - formation in majority of the laes especially at higher redshift .",
    "unfortunately , the shock - induced ly@xmath0  emission due to mergings has not yet been taken into account in these theoretical works ( see also @xcite ) . alternatively , as discussed by @xcite , supernova explosions can cause strong shocks , resulting in strong ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "although the authors intend to explain extended ly@xmath0  blobs ( @xmath12kpc ) with high ly@xmath0  luminosities ( @xmath494ergs@xmath5 ) , their basic ideas can be applied to normal laes .",
    "agn activity and outflows seem unlikely ( see  [ ssec : agn ] and @xcite ) .",
    "when shocks ( even partly ) contribute to emission lines of laes , estimates of physical quantities such as ionization parameter ( from [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratio ) , metallicity ( from @xmath385-index ) , sfr ( from h@xmath0 ) , and dust extinction ( from balmer decrement ) become less accurate . in particular , the intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath25   value becomes larger when shocks are present , resulting in an overestimate of the abundance of dust .",
    "this effect may also help explain the presence of super case b objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the results presented in this paper may require some corrections for the presence of shocks .",
    "we plan to address this in future work , through the simultaneous application of photo - ionization and shock models , with deeper spectroscopy which will detect the weaker lines not fully detected in the observations presented here ( e.g. , balmer lines , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] ) .",
    "a final remark is that from our discussions so far it is evident that ly@xmath0   is not a robust indicator of sfr for laes . the observed data ( @xmath460@xmath461 ) in figure [ fig : fesc ] ( left ) are relatively well represented by a single power - law fit @xmath495 which is shown by the dotted curve in figure [ fig : fesc ] ( left ) .",
    "according to this simple relation , sfrs of laes with ew(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath496   ( a typical threshold in narrowband searches ) can be underestimated by a factor of about @xmath143 .",
    "thus , sfrs estimated from ly@xmath0  may involve a factor of @xmath492 uncertainties intrinsically .",
    "we have presented nirspec and mmirs rest - frame optical spectra of seven ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) at @xmath1 , which are selected from our subaru / suprime - cam nb387 survey in cosmos , chandra deep field south , and ssa22 .",
    "our first nir spectroscopic result discusses the kinematics of laes and is presented in @xcite . as a companion study , this paper presents mainly the ionization and chemical properties of laes based on multiple nebular lines .",

    "<S> we present results from keck / nirspec and magellan / mmirs follow - up spectroscopy of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath1 identified in our subaru narrowband survey . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully detect h@xmath0  emission from seven laes , and perform a detailed analysis of six laes free from agn activity , two out of which , cdfs-3865 and cosmos-30679 , have [ oii ]  and [ oiii ]  line detections . </S>",
    "<S> they are the first [ oii]-detected laes at high-@xmath2 , and their [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratios and @xmath3-indices provide the first simultaneous determinations of ionization parameter and oxygen abundance for laes . </S>",
    "<S> cdfs-3865 has a very high ionization parameter ( @xmath4cms@xmath5 ) and a low oxygen abundance ( @xmath6 ) in contrast with moderate values of other high-@xmath2 galaxies such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> cosmos-30679 also possesses a relatively high ionization parameter ( @xmath7cms@xmath5 ) and a low oxygen abundance ( @xmath8 ) . both laes appear to fall below the mass - metallicity relation of @xmath9 lbgs </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a low metallicity of @xmath10 is independently indicated for typical laes from a composite spectrum and the [ nii]/h@xmath0  index . </S>",
    "<S> such high ionization parameters and low oxygen abundances can be found in local star - forming galaxies , but this extreme local population occupies only @xmath11% of the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample with a number density @xmath12 times smaller than that of laes . with their high ionization parameters and low oxygen abundances , laes would represent an early stage of galaxy formation dominated by massive stars in compact star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies like laes would produce ionizing photons efficiently with a high escape fraction achieved by density - bounded hii   regions , which would significantly contribute to cosmic reionization at @xmath14 . </S>"
