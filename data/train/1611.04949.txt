    "unsolved puzzles of fundamental physics encourage scientists to probe interactions at progressively higher energies .",
    "the large hadron collider has not so far found any hints on new physics , so there are plans to construct even more energetic and luminous experiment . in particular , there is the high - luminosity lhc project @xcite that aims to increase the lhc luminosity by a factor of ten by 2025 and the future circular collider project @xcite that is supposed to reach the hadron collision energy of 100  tev by 2035 .    but",
    "firstly , it is imperative to be sure that this experiment will pose no risk to the earth .",
    "the question of safety of the lhc was examined in detail by the lhc safety assessment group ( e.g. see review @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that the exotic dangerous kinds of matter , such as strangelets , magnetic monopoles , true vacuum bubbles and stable micro black holes , can not be produced at the lhc , for their existence at the energies below 14  tev strongly contradicts astrophysical observations . in this work",
    "we study safety of the future 100  tev collider and limit our research to the danger associated with the stable micro black holes .    microscopic black holes with the masses under 100  tev appear in the extra - dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "in these theories the value of the higher - dimensional panck mass can be as low as several tev .",
    "existing constraints on the parameters of the models with extra dimensions come from the direct measurements of newton s law of gravitation at small distances @xcite and from the lhc searches @xcite for the missing transverse energy of jets due to graviton - emission processes : the radii of the extra dimensions @xmath0 m and the planck mass @xmath1tev . in this work",
    "we will conservatively assume @xmath2tev .",
    "the minimum black hole mass corresponding to the certain @xmath3 can be found from the condition that the entropy of the black hole be large ( see @xcite ) . in the case of six dimensions",
    "the black hole mass @xmath4 corresponds to the entropy @xmath5 and we will take it as the lower threshold of mass . besides , in this work we assume there is no hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "this worst scenario must be taken into account due to the lack of the experimental data concerning the hawking radiation as well as due to the theoretical uncertainties in the field of quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , there are theoretical suggestions @xcite that the process of hawking radiation could depend on the details of the planck - scale degrees of freedom .",
    "there is also the question if the produced black holes , which in general have non - zero charge , lose their charge immediately via the schwinger mechanism @xcite or they remain charged . hypothetically , in the worst case , the schwinger discharge can happen even if there is no hawking radiation ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , so we have to consider the neutral stable micro black holes as well as the charged ones .    in our work",
    "we refer often to the methods proposed by the authors of the study @xcite of safety of the lhc in the context of the stable micro black holes production .",
    "however , we propose a more correct method of the calculation of the number of the black holes trapped inside the earth during the work of high energy collider . besides , we examine some astrophysical mechanisms of micro black hole production , that were not considered in @xcite and that provide conservative model - independent constraints .",
    "let us consider the d - dimensional gravitational action with a general compact metric @xmath6 and the warp factor @xmath7 : @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 are usual non - compact minkowski coordinates .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath11 of the extra dimensions is connected with the planck mass @xmath3 as following : @xmath12 where @xmath13 tev , @xmath14 is the difference in warping between the region with maximum warp factor and the standard model region . in case @xmath15 and zero warping the planck mass @xmath16tev gives the value @xmath17 km , that is obviously excluded . in the theories with large number of extra dimensions @xmath11 decreases with increasing @xmath18 and @xmath19 is already smaller than the existing constraint on @xmath11 ( @xmath0 m ) .    in order to claim that some specific scenario could be dangerous for the earth we have to calculate the time which the black hole needs in order to grow to the macroscopic size . the accretion of the stable micro black holes was in detail studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the accretion goes through three different phases : subnuclear , subatomic and macroscopic . for large number of extra dimensions",
    "we will conservatively neglect the subnuclear phase ( we want to find the lower constraint on the black hole accretion time ) , for @xmath15 or @xmath20 the initial ( black hole mass @xmath21 ) capture radius in matter is larger than the nucleus scale ( e.g. for @xmath22 capture radius @xmath23 ) , so there is no subnuclear phase .",
    "the four - dimensional accretion is much slower than the higher - dimensional one due to the huge value of @xmath24 , that is why the smaller values of @xmath11 cause larger accretion times ( because the transition to the four - dimensional gravity occurs earlier ) .",
    "thus , the most conservative case with the fastest evolution is the case where there is no warping ( @xmath25 ) , apart from the theory with @xmath15 where the warping is crucial and we set the warp factor the way that @xmath26 is maximal and equal to @xmath27 m .",
    "the constraints on the times of the accretion inside the earth for theories with @xmath28 are presented in table [ 1 t ] .",
    "the capture radius of the phase of macroscopic ( bondi ) accretion is bondi radius @xmath29 , the radius @xmath30 denotes the distance of crossover , where the higher - dimensional gravity force equals the four - dimensional one .",
    "the accretion times depend on the properties of the components of the earth .",
    "the authors in @xcite parametrize this dependence by the debye temperature @xmath31 ( that is about 400k for the materials typical for earth s composition ) and the other parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we see that in the theories with more than six dimensions the accretion times are longer than the lifetime of the solar system . in the cases of 5 and 6 dimensions we get accretion times @xmath35yr , which are not large from the geological point of view , though the case @xmath15 requires a theory with the special choice of warping : @xmath36 where @xmath37tev and the limits are given by the experimental constraint on the maximum @xmath11 and the condition that the accretion time is shorter than the solar system lifetime .",
    "the results for both 5 and 6 dimensions are similar , and , bearing in mind that the theory with @xmath15 requires an extreme fine - tuning , we limit our research to the case @xmath22 .",

    "we need the distribution of not only the longitudinal momenta of partons , given by the standard parton distribution functions , but also of the transverse momenta , that is why we use the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions ( tmdpdf ) @xmath56 from the library tmdlib-1.0.7 @xcite . according to the tmd factorization @xcite , the cross section of the bh production ( mass larger than @xmath57 , longitudinal momentum less than @xmath58 and transverse momentum less than @xmath59 )",
    "is given by : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 at the present moment we will assume that the black holes are neutral .",
    "neutral black holes will slow down inside the earth due to the accretion and gravitational scattering .",
    "this process was in detail studied in @xcite , where the maximum speed for a black hole to be still trapped inside the earth was calculated . in our case",
    "( @xmath22 ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the path length of the black hole inside the earth , @xmath65 is the mean diameter of the earth , @xmath37tev .",

    "then the condition for the black hole to be trapped reads as : @xmath71 thus , the fraction of the black holes that will be trapped ( suppression factor ) is given by : @xmath72 where the region @xmath73 is given by the inequality ( [ 1 ] ) and the total cross section @xmath74  by the eq .",

    "[ 4f ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the calculation of the suppression factor in ref .",
    "@xcite was considerably simplified : the authors assumed that all the black holes which were produced had the same lowest possible mass @xmath76 and that their transverse momenta are identical .",
    "these assumptions lead to the underestimated value of the suppression factor , because the maximum initial momentum for a black hole to be still trapped inside the earth @xmath77 and , setting @xmath78 , one gets the underestimated value of this momentum for the black holes with @xmath79 , so not all the trapped black holes are taken into account .",
    "if the stable micro black holes could be produced at the colliders , they would be as well naturally produced in the universe by the high energy cosmic rays .",
    "this can contradict the observed long lifetimes of the dense astrophysical objects , in which these black holes can get stuck and accrete .",
    "first of all , we would like to consider the stopping power of different astrophysical objects .",
    "the theory of the deceleration of the microscopic black holes inside celestial bodies was developed in @xcite .",
    "it was calculated that the earth has not sufficient power to stop neither stable nor charged ( with masses more than 7  tev ) relativistic micro black holes ( we consider the black holes produced in the collisions of the high energy cosmic rays with some slow objects ) , while the sun can stop the charged relativistic black holes with masses well in excess of 100 tev and can not stop the neutral relativistic black holes .",
    "finally , the general expression for the minimum column density required to stop the neutral micro black hole with mass @xmath57 was derived . in our case ( @xmath22 )",
    "this required column density is : @xmath80 where @xmath81g/@xmath82 ,   @xmath83  the initial lorentz factor of the black hole . consider the cosmic ray nucleus with atomic number @xmath7 and high energy @xmath84 hitting the target nucleon .",
    "the initial energy of the produced black hole @xmath85 ( @xmath86  inelasticity , @xmath87  the fraction of the nucleon centre of mass momentum carried by the incident parton ) .",
    "then the condition for the column density @xmath88 required to stop the black hole is : @xmath89 the column density along the diameter of a white dwarf with a mass @xmath90 is @xmath91g/@xmath82 ( see @xcite ) , the same value for the neutron star is @xmath92g/@xmath82 . due to the eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , the neutron star can stop all the black holes going through it ( @xmath84 is limited from above by around @xmath93tev and the stopping condition can never be violated ) , while the white dwarf can stop only a small fraction of them .",
    "there are several mechanisms that could provide the significant fluxes of the micro black holes .",
    "the most efficient mechanism is the collision of the high energy cosmic rays with the surfaces of dense stars .",
    "however , considering this mechanism , one has to account for the large magnetic fields of these stars , which can lead to the considerable synchrotron energy losses of the cosmic rays .",
    "this question was considered by @xcite ( see appendix g there ) .",
    "it was shown that the magnetic screening prevents the cosmic rays with the energies more than @xmath94 from reaching the surface , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the charge of the cosmic ray nucleus , @xmath46 is the star s radius , and @xmath97 is the angle between the momentum of the cosmic ray and the magnetic axis of the star .",
    "this is not important for the case of the white dwarfs with polar magnetic field @xmath98 g ( @xmath99ev ) , but plays an important role for the case of neutron stars , for which the smallest detected magnetic field is @xmath100 g @xcite .",
    "the flux of the micro black holes produced by the cosmic rays hitting the white dwarf surface is : @xmath101 where @xmath102 ,   @xmath103 mb  total nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section ,   @xmath104 = 7\\cdot 10 ^ 5~$]tev ,   @xmath105 ,   @xmath106 $ ] ( most conservative case , corresponding to the minimum production at the 100  tev collider ) ,   @xmath107 ,   @xmath108  the combined energy spectrum of cosmic rays as measured by the auger observatory , fitted with a flux model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the mean atomic number @xmath7 on the energy @xmath84 is taken also from @xcite ( we interpolated auger data and averaged over the two hadronic interaction models epos - lhc and qgsjetii-04 ) , however in the case of the white dwarf the resulting bounds weakly depend on the cosmic ray composition : the black hole production at the given energy decreases with increasing @xmath7 , but also the condition ( [ 3 ] ) becomes less constraining and allows higher energies to be involved .",

    ", we have to limit the region of the integration in the eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) by the condition ( [ 3 ] ) and account for a decrease of the column density @xmath88 for non - zero values of the angle of incidence of the cosmic ray @xmath112 .",
    "the latter is made using the dependence @xmath113 ( fig . 1 from @xcite ) .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the trapped black holes is given by the small @xmath112 , so we conservatively take @xmath114 ( decreasing the value of @xmath115 by @xmath116 due to the possible systematic error , see @xcite ) ,   @xmath117",
    ". the calculated number of the black holes stopped ( @xmath118yr , @xmath119 km ) is plotted as a function of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ 5f ] , for the auger data @xmath120 and for the @xmath121 proton composition of the cosmic rays .",
    "the calculation that uses auger data on the composition sets the lower bound on the number of the black holes , because cosmic rays with the small atomic number @xmath7 ( e.g. protons ) give the main contribution to the black hole production , while increasing @xmath7 ( till @xmath122 of iron ) yields the number of black holes by orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "thus , considering the mean value of @xmath7 , we get the conservative estimates of the production .",
    "one can see that in the theories with @xmath123tev there is at least one black hole that is stopped by the white dwarf .",
    "one can see also that , due to the stopping condition , this constraint on @xmath52 would not improve significantly , even if we knew the precise cosmic ray composition .",
    "the composition that yields the biggest number of the black holes trapped ( the most optimistic scenario ) is @xmath124 p and it gives only @xmath125tev .",
    "now let us consider the neutron star .",
    "for the high energy cosmic rays can not reach its surface due to the magnetic screening , we examine the other , less effective mechanisms of the black hole production :    * the production on the baryons during the lifetime of the universe .",
    "we conservatively assume that the cosmic ray flux is the same till the redshift @xmath126 ( in reality it is supposed to increase with redshift ) .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) , considering cosmic rays with the energies below the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin(gzk ) limit@xcite . for these energies the energy loss length for protons is more than 1  gpc . we have also checked that explicit account for non - uniform distribution of extragalactic baryons @xcite very weakly affects our estimate .",

    "* the production in binary systems of the neutron star and the red giant : cosmic rays hit the giant and produce the black holes which then impinge on the neutron star ( we remind you that in the case of neutron star we consider the neutral black holes , so they are not affected by the magnetic field ) ; @xmath137 , however @xmath138full coverage equivalent @xmath139myr ( see @xcite , appendix h ) , * the production on the interstellar medium ( @xmath140 , where @xmath141@xmath142  average column density of the hydrogen in the galaxy ) .",
    "* the production on the central molecular zone of our galaxy @xcite , for which @xmath143 , however by now one has observed no long - lived neutron stars in this zone ( typical ages are @xmath144yr ) .",
    "the first three mechanisms give the comparable fluxes of the black holes ( the second 6.5 times higher than the first , the first 4.6 times higher than the third ) , the fourth mechanism gives 4 - 5 orders of magnitude less ( however , the last mechanism will be the most constraining , if the millisecond pulsars will be detected in the central molecular zone ) .",
    "we use the first mechanism for our estimates , because the second one is more model - dependent and yields large systematic errors .",

    "we limit the energy of the cosmic rays from above by @xmath150ev , so the most optimistic case of @xmath151p composition is quite possible .",
    "worse result , with the maximum @xmath52 around 4  tev , is given by the mechanism of the cosmic rays ( we take @xmath152 ) hitting the surface of the neutron star with the minimum magnetic field @xmath153 g .",
    "the energy of the cosmic rays in this case is smaller than @xmath154tev due to the condition ( [ 4 ] ) ; this energy is not sufficient for the production of the black holes with large masses .",
    "the magnetic field can be neglected at the poles , however at the high energies the surface area that can be reached there is too small and the flux is less than in the case of the mechanisms studied above . in general",
    ", one can see that the constraints on @xmath52 are worse in case of the neutron stars than in the case of the white dwarfs .",
    "however , the future detection of the old neutron stars in the central molecular zone and the data on the composition of the cosmic rays can improve the existing constraints from the neutron stars and make them the most robust .",
    "till now we considered the neutral black holes . the charged black holes will be stopped in the white dwarf for the whole range of energies due to the electromagnetic interactions . in order to get the number of the black holes stopped during the lifetime of a white dwarf",
    ", we have to do the same calculations , as in case of the neutral black holes , however ignoring the inequality ( [ 3 ] ) . for @xmath124 proton composition of the cosmic rays",
    "the number of the stopped black holes exceeds @xmath155 till the planck masses of @xmath156tev , so the theories without the mechanism of schwinger discharge yield more than one black hole trapped in the white dwarf during its lifetime , if there is at least @xmath157 fraction of protons in the cosmic rays below gzk - limit .",
    "this fraction is very likely to be confirmed by the future experiments on the composition of the cosmic rays .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the micro black hole will accrete the neutron star very fast relative to the lifetimes of the known neutron stars ( in our case accretion time @xmath158min@xmath159days ) .",
    "the white dwarf in our case will be destroyed in @xmath160yr@xmath161yr , that is also negligible in comparison with the observed lifetimes of the white dwarfs .",
    "thus , the astrophysical observations constrain the theories in question and forbid the production of the charged stable micro black holes ( in case of at least @xmath157 proton composition of the cosmic rays below gzk - limit and any possible dangerous planck mass ) and the production of the neutral stable micro black holes in the theories with planck mass smaller than 7.35  tev at the 100  tev collider .",
    "one has to mention that the robust astrophysical constraints hypothetically can be obtained from the mechanism of high energy neutrinos hitting the surface of the neutron star , see @xcite ( appendix e.3 ) . however , there is no experimental evidence of the existence of such high energy ( @xmath162  tev ) neutrino flux , as well as we do not know exactly how the neutrinos behave in large magnetic fields .",
    "the future advances in neutrino physics can improve the situation .",
    "in this article we have examined the safety of proposed 100  tev colliders in the context of the production of stable micro black holes in models with extra dimensions .",
    "the models with more than 6 dimensions even in the worst case scenario yield earth s accretion times larger than the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "a theory with five dimensions could be consistent with existing experimental constraints on the size of extra dimensions and yield in the worst case scenario accretion times smaller than the lifetime of the solar system only with fine - tuning of the warp - factor , given by the inequalities ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "thus , the study of the accretion times allowed us to limit our further research with the similar cases of 5 and 6 dimensions with the preference to the case of 6 dimensions .",
    "the calculation of the number of the neutral black holes trapped inside the earth for the integrated luminosity @xmath163fb@xmath51 of the future 100  tev collider and the astrophysical constraints from the observational data on the lifetime of the white dwarfs suggest that the risks from the neutral micro black holes are tiny . indeed , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ 8f ] , astrophysical bounds on the planck mass predict that the number of the trapped neutral black holes should be less than 1 ( more precisely , the probability that at least one black hole will be trapped inside the earth during the whole time of the exploitation of the collider is less than @xmath164 ) .",
    "taking into consideration all the peculiarities of the theory required ( the absence of the hawking radiation while the presence of the schwinger discharge , see also @xcite ) and the needed fine - tuning of the planck mass ( @xmath165tev ) , we see that there is practically no danger .",
    "the constraints can be improved via observation of the long - lived neutron stars in the central molecular zone and clarification of the cosmic ray composition below gzk - limit .",

    "more than that , the first years of exploitation of 100  tev collider ( while the integrated luminosity is still small ) will strengthen the constraints on the value of the planck mass . needless to say ,",
