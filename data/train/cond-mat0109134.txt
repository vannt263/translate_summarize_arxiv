    "a self - avoiding polygon ( sap ) can be defined as a walk on a lattice which returns to the origin and has no other self - intersections .",
    "generally saps are considered distinct up to a translation , so if there are @xmath0 saps of length @xmath1 there are @xmath2 walks ( the factor of two arising since the walk can go in either direction ) .",
    "the enumeration of self - avoiding polygons on various lattices is an interesting combinatorial problem in its own right , and is also of considerable importance in the statistical mechanics of lattice models @xcite . despite strenuous effort",
    "this problem has not been solved on any regular two dimensional lattice .",
    "however , progress has been made in the study of restricted classes of polygons and many problems have been solved exactly .",
    "these include staircase polygons @xcite , convex polygons @xcite , row - convex polygons @xcite , and almost convex polygons @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study two simple modifications of sap .",
    "osculating polygons ( op ) form a super - set in which we allow the walk to touch at a vertex but not to cross .",
    "neighbour - avoiding polygons ( nap ) are only allowed to have nearest neighbour vertices when the adjoining edge is part of the perimeter of the polygon ( any two occupied vertices are separated by at least one empty vertex ) and they are a sub - set of sap .",
    "see figure  [ fig : onap ] for an example of each case .",
    "osculating polygons were introduced in @xcite while neighbour - avoiding polygons were studied in @xcite as the special limiting case of interacting polygons with infinitely strong repulsion .",
    "we use the finite lattice method to count the number of osculating and neighbour - avoiding polygons on the square lattice .",
    "we also calculate their radius of gyration and the first and second area - weighted moments .",
    "the quantities we consider are : ( i ) the polygon generating function , @xmath3 ; ( ii ) @xmath4 area - weighted moments of polygons of perimeter @xmath1 , @xmath5 ; and ( iii ) the mean - square radius of gyration of polygons of perimeter @xmath1 , @xmath6 .",
    "these quantities are expected to behave as    @xmath7 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\langle a^k \\rangle _ n & = & e^{(k)}n^{2k\\nu}[1+o(1 ) ] , \\\\",
    "\\langle r^2 \\rangle _ n & = & d n^{2\\nu}[1+o(1 ) ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the reciprocal of the critical point of the generating function , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are known exactly @xcite , though non - rigorously , in the case of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "very firm evidence exists from previous numerical work that the exponent @xmath11 is universal and thus equals 1/2 for all two dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath12 is likewise well supported by the existing numerical evidence @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the sap amplitude combination @xmath13 is universal , and that    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the area per site and @xmath16 is an integer such that @xmath0 is non - zero only if @xmath1 is divisible by @xmath16 .",
    "for the square lattice @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed numerically for sap on many different lattices @xcite .",
    "we would expect the universality of these amplitude combinations to hold for nap .",
    "what happens for op is not immediately clear .",
    "the derivation in @xcite relies on the self - avoidance and indeed the universality does not extend to trailgons ( trails are walks which are allowed to share a vertex but _ not _ an edge ) which are a super - set of op .",
    "we shall provide compelling evidence that with a suitable definition of the radius of gyration the universality does extend to op .",
    "any polygon has a minimal bounding rectangle .",
    "a polygon is said to be convex if its perimeter has the same length as its minimal bounding rectangle .",
    "more generally one can classify polygons according to their concavity @xmath19 , with the perimeter of a polygon of concavity @xmath19 exceeding the length of the minimal bounding rectangle by @xmath20 . for both op and nap",
    "we have found exact solutions for the generating functions for convex and almost - convex ( @xmath21 ) polygons .    in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the generalisation of the finite lattice method required in order to enumerate op and nap .",
    "the results of the analysis of the series are presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "exact results for the generating functions for convex and almost - convex op and nap are presented in section  [ sec : convex ] .",
    "the method used to enumerate op and nap on the square lattice are simple generalisations of the method devised by enting @xcite in his pioneering work and includes the significant enhancements employed in previous work @xcite . the general method has been described in some detail in these papers and for this reason we shall be very brief and only give the absolute essential information .",
    "the first terms in the series for the polygon generating function can be calculated using transfer matrix techniques to count the number of polygons in rectangles @xmath22 edges wide and @xmath23 edges long .",
    "the transfer matrix technique involves drawing a boundary through the rectangle intersecting a set of @xmath24 edges .",
    "for each configuration of occupied or empty edges along the boundary we maintain a ( perimeter ) generating function for partially completed polygons .",
    "polygons in a given rectangle are enumerated by moving the boundary so as to add one site at a time as shown in figure  [ fig : transfer ] .",
    "configurations are represented by a set of edge states @xmath25 , where    @xmath26    reading configurations from the bottom edge up , the partially completed polygon in figure  [ fig : transfer ] is encoded as @xmath27 before the move of the boundary line and @xmath28 after the move .",
    "the rules for updating the partial generating functions are described in @xcite and we refer the interested reader to this paper for further details .    in the following sections we shall briefly outline the changes required in order to enumerate op and nap",
    ".      op are allowed to have vertices on which the perimeter touch but no crossing takes place .",
    "obviously such vertices are of degree 4 and in terms of the updating rules are vertices with two incoming and outgoing occupied edges .",
    "the possibilities are thus that the incoming edges are in states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
    "the first three of these are essentially identical in that they permit similar outputs . from @xmath29 we can produce the outputs @xmath33 ( with appropriate relabelling of the remainder of the configuration as per the original sap problem ) and the two additional outputs @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "the three possibilities are illustrated in figure  [ fig : opupdate ] and correspond to cases where , respectively , the edges are joined with no further action , bounce of one - another , or are joined and a new loop is inserted . the case @xmath32 is special in that joining the edges results in a closed loop and thus the formation of a separate component .",
    "this is only allowed provided there are no other occupied edges and the result is a valid polygon .",
    "this leaves us just with the ` bouncing ' output @xmath32 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : opupdate ] . the updating rules for the transfer - matrix algorithm",
    "are summarised in table  [ tab : opupdate ] .    at this point",
    "it is pertinent to give some detail about our calculation of the radius of gyration .",
    "the general algorithm was described in @xcite but we made some changes to accommodate the degree 4 vertices of op . in the basic definition",
    "@xcite one calculates the radius of gyration of the vertices contained in the perimeter of the polygon .",
    "the problem is how to count the degree 4 vertices of op .",
    "we have chosen to rely on the definition of polygons as walks which return to the starting point . viewed in this light",
    "it is natural to count degree 4 vertices twice , once for each time the walk visits the vertex .",
    "this makes the necessary generalisation of the algorithm quite simple and no further details will be given . as we shall see",
    "when analysing the series this definition also ensures that the amplitude combinations @xmath34 and @xmath13 remain universal .",
    "we calculated the number of op with perimeter up to @xmath35 and their radius of gyration and area - weighted moment up to @xmath36 .",
    "the generalisations to nap is a little more involved , but the required generalisation has been described in some detail in @xcite and we shall thus be brief . in order to ensure the nearest neighbour avoidance we have to encode some extra information in the boundary configuration .",
    "essentially we introduce an extra state ` 3 ' , which labels an empty edge along which a contact could occur , i.e. an empty edge next to the perimeter of the polygon . as an illustration consider again the partially completed polygon in figure  [ fig : transfer ] .",
    "this is now encoded as @xmath37 before the move of the boundary line and @xmath38 after the move .",
    "we are not allowed to occupy any edge adjacent to an edge in state ` 3 ' since this would result in an illegal contact .",
    "this restriction means the updating rules can depend not only on the edges in the kink itself ( as for sap and op ) but also on the states of nearby edges .",
    "the rules for allowed transition of the boundary line in the transfer - matrix algorithm are summarised in table  [ tab : napupdate ] .",
    "we calculated the number of nap with perimeter up to @xmath39 and their radius of gyration and area - weighted moment up to @xmath36 .",
    "the series have exponentially growing coefficients , with sub - dominant term given by a critical exponent .",
    "the generic behaviour is @xmath40 and hence the coefficients of the generating function @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . to obtain the singularity structure of the generating functions we used the numerical method of differential approximants @xcite . combining the relationship given above between the coefficients in a series and the critical behaviour of the corresponding generating function with the expected behaviour eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefgrowth ] ) of the mean - square radius of gyration and moments of area yields the following prediction for their generating functions :    @xmath43    as stated previously the exponent @xmath44 while @xmath12 .",
    "since the series only contain even terms and the smallest polygon has size 4 , we actually analyse the series @xmath45 , and so on , and obtain estimates for @xmath46 .",
    "our use of differential approximants have been described in detail in @xcite so suffice to say that estimates for the critical points and exponents are obtained by averaging over many separate approximants each using most of the series coefficients and yielding individual estimates .",
    "a very rough and not necessarily reliable error estimate is obtained from the spread among the approximants .",
    "next we turn our attention to the `` fine structure '' of the asymptotic form of the coefficients .",
    "in particular we are interested in obtaining accurate estimates for the amplitudes @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we do this by fitting the coefficients to the assumed form ( [ eq : coefgrowth ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic form of the coefficients @xmath0 of the sap generating function was studied in detail previously @xcite . as argued in @xcite",
    "there is no sign of non - analytic corrections - to - scaling exponents to the polygon generating function and one therefore finds that @xmath50 this form was confirmed with great accuracy in @xcite . for the radius of gyration coefficients we found in @xcite that we had to take direct account of the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath51 which leads to the asymptotic form    @xmath52.\\ ] ]    alternative we could also fit to the form @xmath53.\\ ] ] asymptotic forms similar to those above also hold for the area - moment coefficients after the appropriate change of the leading exponent .      in table  [ tab : opcrit ] we have listed estimates for the critical point and exponents obtained from second and third order differential approximants to the polygon generating function , radius of gyration , and first area moment series . it is obvious that the op generating function has an exponent consistent with the exact values @xmath54 , as we would expect .",
    "it is equally clear that the first moment as expected has a logarithmic singularity thus confirming @xmath12 . from the polygon series we also find an accurate estimate for the critical point @xmath55 .",
    "the estimates for the exponent of the radius of gyration series differs slightly from the expected value of @xmath56 .",
    "however , the estimates obtained from this series are also much less accurate than those from the other series and the value @xmath57 can certainly not be ruled out . in order to try to obtain a more accurate estimate of @xmath58 and resolve the discrepancy of the radius of gyration series we look in greater detail at estimates from the individual differential approximants . in figure",
    "[ fig : opcrit ] we have plotted estimates of the critical exponents vs. the corresponding critical points . from the data in the left panel we see an essentially linear relationship between estimates for the exponent @xmath59 and @xmath58 , we notice that the exponent attains its expected value 3/2 when @xmath60 , which we take as our final estimate for @xmath58 , and we thus find @xmath61 . as one would expect @xmath62 is larger than the connective constant @xmath63 for sap . from the data for the radius of gyration we notice that the curve traced by estimates comes very close to crossing through the point given by the expected exponent value and the value for @xmath58 just obtained .",
    "we also note that in a similar plot using second order approximants the curve was further removed from this point .",
    "we take this as firm evidence that given a sufficiently long series and high enough order approximants any discrepancy between the behaviour of the actual estimates and the expected behaviour would be completely resolved .",
    "having confirmed that the exponents have their expected values and obtained a very accurate estimate for @xmath58 , we turn our attention to the leading amplitudes .",
    "first we note that the expected asymptotic form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polasymp ] ) is completely confirmed by repeating the analysis carried for the sap case @xcite .",
    "the results for the leading amplitude are displayed in figure  [ fig : opampl ] .",
    "we notice that all fits appear to converge to the same value as @xmath64 , and that , as more and more correction terms are added to the fits the estimates exhibits less curvature and that the slope become smaller ( although the fits using 9 terms are a little inconclusive ) .",
    "this is very strong evidence that eq .",
    "( [ eq : polasymp ] ) indeed is the correct asymptotic form of @xmath0 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding plots for the amplitude combination @xmath34 , obtained from the radius of gyration series , clearly show that these estimates are consistent with the exact value @xmath66 , and we thus estimate @xmath67 . a similar analysis of the area - moment series yields the estimate @xmath68 . from this",
    "we find the amplitude ratio @xmath69 in remarkable agreement with the estimate @xmath70 from the sap series @xcite .      table  [ tab : napcrit ] lists estimates for the critical point and exponents for the nap series .",
    "albeit the accuracy of these estimates is somewhat poorer than before there can be no doubt that the exponent estimates are consistent with the expected exact values .",
    "again we use a plot of @xmath59 vs. @xmath58 to obtain the improved estimate @xmath71 and thus @xmath72 .",
    "as expected this connective constant is smaller than the sap counter - part .",
    "we note that the corresponding value for the walk generating function @xmath73 is in full agreement with the unbiased estimate @xmath74 given in @xcite , but quite a bit larger than the same papers biased estimate @xmath75 .",
    "the only possible explanation we can think off for this discrepancy is that perhaps the exponent used in biasing was wrong .",
    "cardy @xcite predicted that excluding walks with parallel nearest - neighbour steps should result in a change in the exponent @xmath76 of the walk generating function .",
    "numerical studies confirmed a slight change in exponent for manhattan lattice saw @xcite ( by it very definition the manhattan lattice does not allow any parallel nearest - neighbour steps ) .",
    "clearly neighbour - avoiding walks have no nearest - neighbour steps at all . in @xcite",
    "the authors used the usual saw exponent @xmath77 , which thus could be the wrong choice for neighbour - avoiding walks .",
    "in fact one might see the discrepancy with the biased estimate for @xmath78 as further evidence that there is a change in the exponent @xmath76 for walks with no parallel nearest - neighbour steps .    for nap the analysis of the radius of gyration and area - moment series",
    "confirm the universality of @xmath34 and @xmath13 .",
    "using this and the direct analysis of the polygon series we arrive at the amplitude estimates @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "in section  [ sec : flm ] we described how the series expansion for the polygon generating function was calculated by counting the number of polygons spanning various @xmath82 rectangles . from this data it is obviously easy to extract the corresponding series for the generating functions for convex polygons with concavity @xmath19 . in the following we use these series to calculate the exact generating functions for convex and almost - convex op and nap .    throughout this section",
    "we use the variable @xmath83 as the conjugate of the semi - perimeter of the polygons . in other words",
    "the coefficients of @xmath84 is the number of polygons of perimeter @xmath85 .",
    "the generating function for convex osculating polygons ( cop ) is quite easy to derive .",
    "first of all we note that any ordinary convex polygon is a cop .",
    "so all we need calculate is the generating function for polygons with at least one osculation .",
    "it is not difficult to see that these polygons can be obtained by simple concatenations . in the simplest case",
    "we can take a convex polygon whose top right - hand corner is also the corner of the minimal bounding rectangle and concatenate with a convex polygon whose bottom left - hand coincides with the bounding rectangle ( obviously these two types of polygons have identical generating functions ) . due to to the convexity constraint the only way to get more osculations is by inserting convex polygons where _ both _ the top right - hand and bottom left - hand corners are shared with the minimal bounding rectangle . thankfully the generating functions for these types of polygons are already known .",
    "the generating function for the first type of polygons was calculated by lin and chang @xcite and in their honour we shall stick with their notation and call this function @xmath86 .",
    "the second intermediate type of convex polygons are the well - known and much loved staircase polygons , their generating function is @xmath87 .",
    "since we can insert any number of staircase polygons and go along either diagonal of the square lattice we find that the generating function , @xmath88 , for convex osculating polygons is    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the generating function for convex polygons .",
    "after inserting the known generating functions    @xmath91    and doing a little arithmetic we find    @xmath92 -x^3(1 + 2x)^2/[(1 - 4x)^{-3/2}(2+x)].\\ ] ]    the generating function , @xmath93 , for convex neighbour - avoiding polygons ( cnap ) is simply @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "in other words , with the exception of the simplest polygon of size @xmath95 , the number of cop is identical to the number of cnap with four more steps .",
    "this means that there should be a simple bijection between cop with perimeter @xmath1 and cnap with perimeter @xmath96 . to describe this bijection",
    "we need a slightly different way to describe a convex polygon .",
    "we can define convex polygons as consisting of four straight lines ( one on each side of the minimal bounding rectangle ) connected via directed walks , e.g. the left - most line is connected to the top - most line via a walk taking steps only to the right and up and so on .",
    "mutually the directed walks have to respect the general restrictions for a given class of polygons .",
    "we can get a contact where the directed walks connect to the straight lines . from this",
    "we see that a necessary conditions for a cnap is that all straight pieces have length at least 2 ( it is not sufficient since the mutual neighbour avoidance of the directed walks is not automatically guaranteed ) .",
    "the bijection is now obvious . to go from a cop to a cnap with 4 more steps we simply extend each straight piece by a single step and to go from a cnap to a cop we contract each straight piece by a single step",
    "that the first operation takes us from a cop to a cnap is clear .",
    "the convexity is clearly preserved and the extension of the straight pieces ensures that all occupied vertices are separated by an empty vertex and thus the condition on a nap is fulfilled . that the reverse operation takes us from a cnap to a cop",
    "is perhaps not as obvious .",
    "note however that due to the neighbour avoidance there is at least one empty vertex between any two vertices of the cnap .",
    "so deletion operation can never result in overlapping or crossing of occupied edges , at most we can get an osculation .",
    "the generating function , @xmath97 for almost convex polygons was calculated exactly by lin @xcite , who found    @xmath98 + 4x^3b/[(1-x)(1 - 3x+x^2)(1 - 4x)^3],\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 and @xmath47 are low - order polynomials with integer coefficients :    @xmath100    given the close similarity between op , nap and sap it is natural to look for a solution of a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : acp ] ) . from the solution to the convex case eq .",

    "using standard mathematical software packages it is easy to check for solutions of a form similar to to eq .",
    "( [ eq : acp ] ) . in this case",
    "we simply make an educated guess for the denominator @xmath48 associated with @xmath47 , multiply our series for almost - convex polygons with @xmath48 and look for a solution of the form @xmath102 by formally expanding this expression and solving for the unknown coefficients in the polynomials @xmath99 and @xmath47 .    in this manner we found the generating function for almost - convex op to be    @xmath103   + 4x^2b^{\\rm o}/[(2\\ ! + \\ !",
