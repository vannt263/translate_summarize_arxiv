    "the mapping of dark matter substructure around the galaxy is crucial to understanding how our own milky way was assembled over cosmic time .",
    "numerical simulations of the concordant cosmology , dark - energy and cold dark - matter ( @xmath5cdm ) , predict a multitude of dark - matter subhaloes going down in mass to approximately @xmath6 @xcite . on the detectable scale of dwarf galaxies , this discrepancy approaches an order of magnitude between the observed dwarf galaxies and the number of predicted subhaloes @xcite .",
    "recent discoveries of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies go someway towards filling this gap @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the minuscule stellar populations , finding ultra faint dwarfs continues to be challenging and the exact number of them are unknown .",
    "the low stellar content of them however , makes them potentially excellent objects to search for dark matter annihilation signals @xcite .",
    "so far , no significant detections have been made , although upper limits have been placed on the properties of dark matter @xcite .",
    "in addition to dwarf galaxies , the galactic halo contains a large number of intriguing substructures in the form of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) @xcite .",
    "the suggestion of dark matter surrounding a population of these hvcs has been around for over a decade @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigation has determined that any such population is likely to be small in comparison to dark matter free hvcs , both around our own galaxy @xcite and also around other galaxies @xcite . near the disc some of the hvcs are likely to arise through a galactic fountain , where numerous supernova launch gas from the disc of the galaxy @xcite , however , this process is likely to produce small , intermediate velocity clouds over hvcs @xcite .",
    "many hvcs that lie within 50 kpc of the milky way likely had their origin in the magellanic stream and thus arose from the lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "extragalactic hvcs are seen at a wide range of projected distances , often exceeding @xmath7  kpc from the nearest galaxy , are likely to be clumps of pristine gas infalling for the first time and possess a phase - space distribution that is incompatible with the expected dark matter substructure @xcite . even at low projected distances ( @xmath8@xmath9  kpc )",
    "many of the extragalactic hvcs are not associated with regions of star formation suggesting that they too are infalling for the first time @xcite . despite the abundance of other sources for hvcs , explaining why all dark matter subhaloes that failed to form stars",
    "lack any gas is difficult and a small fraction of hvcs may be such objects .    in order to investigate the dark matter content in clouds , we recently searched for gamma - ray emission from dark matter annihilation at the location of several compact clouds in the galfa - hi compact cloud catalogue @xcite .",
    "however , due to poorly constrained dark matter profiles and unknown distances to these objects severely limited our analysis . to advance more thoroughly , we need to examine systems with better distance determinations and are likely to be candidates for dark matter embedded hvcs .",
    "the best candidate for such a search is the smith cloud , a massive system near the galactic disc @xcite .",
    "the smith cloud is located close by at @xmath10  kpc @xcite , and of particular appeal is that a dark - matter subhalo seems to be required for the survival of the gas cloud after a passage through the galactic disc @xcite .    given its relative proximity , apparent orbit and large mass it appears to qualify as the ideal astrophysical site to test the dark matter confinement of clouds .",
    "here we search for potential gamma - ray emission from the dark matter annihilation of weakly interacting particles ( wimps ) around the smith cloud . in section 2 we present arguments in favour of a dark - matter subhalo surrounding the smith cloud .",
    "next , we present the _ fermi_-lat analysis and derive _ fermi _ upper limits to the gamma - ray flux . in section 5",
    ", we turn the results into limits on annihilation cross sections .",
    "finally , we summarise our results and present our conclusions .",
    "most hvcs do not require dark matter to explain their survivability and formation , being able to form through galactic fountains , tidal stripping of gas or condensation of primordial gas .",
    "we argue that none of these processes are likely to have created the smith cloud , and that a gas cloud encapsulated by dark matter provides the best model .",
    "the smith cloud is an extraordinary gas structure with a cometary tail being accreted onto the galaxy @xcite .",
    "unusually for a hvc , the distance to the smith cloud is relatively well know ( to within @xmath11 ) .",
    "based on stellar bracketing @xcite , interaction of stripped material with disc gas @xcite and the flux of h@xmath12 reflected from the galactic disc @xcite , the distance to the smith cloud is known to be @xmath10  kpc @xcite .    here",
    "we use hi 21  cm data from a preliminary reduction of a new survey of the smith cloud with the 100 meter green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "the new survey covers more than twice the area of the @xcite survey and uses a different spectrometer that provides four times the velocity resolution ( @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 ) over a @xmath14 times greater lsr velocity range , @xmath15 to @xmath16  km  s@xmath2  lsr .",
    "the preliminary reduction of the new survey data has a median noise level of 65  mk , a factor 1.5  times more sensitive than the previous survey , and the observing and reduction techniques produce maps at the full 9.1  arcmin resolution of the gbt .",
    "the new survey is also corrected for residual stray radiation @xcite improving the dynamic range at low velocities .",
    "the new data show that the smith cloud is considerably more extended than previously thought , with a diffuse tail to at least @xmath17 and components that appear to have been detached from the main structure ( e.g. at @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the observations are nearing completion and the full data set will be published separately .    the existence of a velocity gradient across the cloud allows a determination of the true @xmath20 velocity ( and consequent orbit ) if the smith cloud is travelling along the plane of the sky .",
    "the orbit is calculated using the potential from @xcite as detailed in @xcite .",
    "using the orbital determination of @xcite the cloud will have passed through the disc approximately @xmath21  myr ago at a radius of @xmath22  kpc .",
    "such an orbit assumes that the velocity gradient is towards the lower end , that drag is minimal along the smith clouds orbit , and the current distance estimate is correct .",
    "we have examined the effects of changing the velocity gradient , distance , and introducing drag with coefficients of drag up to @xmath23 .",
    "even with the most generous assumptions of drag , distance and velocity gradient , the total velocity of the smith cloud is restricted by observations to @xmath24  km  s@xmath2 and so can not have fallen in from infinity .",
    "furthermore , in all but the most extreme cases , the smith clouds orbit will pass through the disc at a radius of approximately @xmath22  kpc , and hence the cloud must have passed through the disc or been created in the past @xmath25@xmath21  myr .",
    "compared to most of the clouds that surround the milky way , the smith cloud is exceptionally massive , with a gas mass exceeding @xmath26 .",
    "correspondingly , the energy contained in the smith cloud is also extremely large compared to the gas at any potential launching point inside the galactic disc ( @xmath27  erg ) .",
    "this tremendous energy requirement would require of order @xmath28  supernova in order to produce sufficient energy to dislodge the smith cloud inside a galactic fountain .",
    "such a process would also have to take place at a radius @xmath25@xmath22  kpc ( the distance where the smith cloud s orbit intersects the disc @xmath25@xmath21  myr ago ) in order to be produced ( such a simple calculation is in line with a linear scaling of galactic fountain hydrodynamic simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "the requirements of a massive cluster at a large radius hence makes it extremely unlikely that the smith cloud was formed through any galactic fountain .    that the smith cloud would be exceptionally rare if it was a product of the galactic fountain",
    "is further supported by the the fact that the largest observed cloud elevated by a supershell is only @xmath29  @xmath30 and , like most gas clouds associated with the galactic fountain , has a low peculiar velocity relative to the disc @xcite .",
    "if it did not arise directly from the disc , it is still possible to have avoided a disc passage if it had undergone a tidal interaction in the recent past .",
    "however , there is no obvious candidate to have provided such a massive cloud and given the paucity of dwarf galaxies that contain gas @xcite , the detection of a suitable host that until recently held gas would raise further questions .      without arising from the disc and a tidal event being unlikely",
    ", the original origin of the smith cloud is likely to be from extragalactic infalling gas .",
    "such hvcs are potentially able to survive to near the disc without any dark matter through ablative shielding @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggest that dark matter will suppress the characteristic substructure present within hvcs as they approach the disc .",
    "however , little work has been done on the passage of hvcs through the disc , potentially the biggest impediment to the survival of the smith cloud .",
    "we note that the current cloud total velocity relative to the expected milky way virial velocity @xmath31 , compatible with phase space data of substructure at @xmath32 kpc in simulated high resolution dark matter haloes of milky way mass @xcite .    at @xmath22  kpc ,",
    "the surface density of the disc is approximately @xmath33  @xmath1 @xcite and is increased by a factor of three due to the oblique angle at which the smith cloud passes through the disc . at such high column densities gas clouds passing through the disc",
    "are likely to be heavily disrupted .",
    "simple toy models presented in @xcite suggest that this disc passage and ram pressure stripping throughout the orbit will require a dark matter halo to survive to the present day .",
    "we supplement the toy model argument presented previously , which suggested a dark matter halo of @xmath34@xmath35  @xmath30 , with numerical simulations of a cloud passing through a disc with and without a supporting dark matter halo .      in an attempt to replicate the observed mass , morphology and distribution of the smith cloud today , shown in fig .",
