    "from a consideration of its condensed matter physics properties , crystal structure , and metallurgy , plutonium is probably the most complicated element in the periodic table ,  @xcite including a phase diagram with six allotropic phases .",
    "the low - temperature monoclinic @xmath4-phase is stable up to 395 k while the face - center - cubic ( fcc ) @xmath0-phase is stable between 592 and 724 k. furthermore , in stabilized alloys the @xmath4 to @xmath0 phase transformation of pu has a significant volume expansion , with the @xmath0-phase 25% larger in volume than the @xmath4-phase .",
    "this behavior is related to the special position of pu in the periodic table , which is at the boundary between the light actinides that have itinerant 5@xmath5 electrons and the heavy actinides with localized 5@xmath5 electrons .",
    "in this situation the electrons are in a very strongly correlated state where even the best conventional lda band - structure calculations can not predict its unique properties , e.g. , the @xmath0-phase volume  @xcite in the experimentally observed nonmagnetic state .",
    "this failure has stimulated numerous attempts to include additonal electronic correlation effects .",
    "although lda theory has repeatedly claimed  @xcite that the thermal expansion in pu is a consequence of magnetism , this is in striking contradiction with experimental data .",
    "@xcite several research groups  @xcite have applied the lda+@xmath2 method to include more @xmath5-@xmath5 correlation energy . by adjusting the on - site coulomb repulsion energy ( @xmath2 ) appropriately ,",
    "it has been possible to fit to the experimental @xmath0-phase volume .",
    "the lda+@xmath2 calculations also indicated an instability of @xmath0-pu toward an antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "more recent calculations based on the `` around - mean - field '' lsda+@xmath2 including the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite or the fully - localized - limit lsda+@xmath2 quenched the spin polarization through an @xmath6 configuration , and obtained the correct @xmath0-phase volume due to a weak exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite to predict the correct volume , a mixed - level model has also been proposed by one of us together with co - workers .",
    "@xcite in this model , four of the five 5_f _ electrons in the @xmath0-phase were constrained to be localized and were not allowed to hop from site to site , but could hybridize with the conduction electrons .",
    "a major advance came when a new calculation scheme was proposed to merge lda - based methods with dmft .",
    "@xcite dmft  @xcite is a many - body technique that is able to treat the band- and atomic - like aspect simultaneously when applied to plutonium . within the lda+dmft approach ,  @xcite the origin of substantial volume expansion",
    "was explained in terms of the competition between coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy .",
    "thus , two dramatically different pictures for the non - magnetism of @xmath0-pu have emerged . in the `` 5@xmath7 '' picture ,",
    "@xcite by including the spin - orbit interaction , one starts with a closed @xmath8 atomic subshell fully filled with six electrons while the @xmath9 subshell is empty , making pu magnetically inert . in the `` 5@xmath10 '' picture ,",
    "@xcite one starts with an open @xmath8 atomic subshell filled with five electrons , resulting in a magnetic moment that should be screened by the @xmath11 valence electrons",
    ". therefore , more studies are necessary to determine which picture will prevail .    in this paper , we report a systematic lda+dmft study of the spectral properties of @xmath0-pu with varying @xmath1 occupancy . throughout this work",
    ", the lda part of hamiltonian is determined from a new tb fit to fp - lapw calculations .",
    "the dmft equations are solved using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations as well as the more approximate hubbard - i method .",
    "these provide an accurate characterization of spectral properties of @xmath0-pu .",
    "it is found that the @xmath1 spectral density of pu is very sensitive to its occupancy .",
    "good agreement is found with photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements when about five electrons occupy the @xmath8 subshell , in support of the second picture .",
    "other recent work appears also to be in support of this picture .",
    "measurements of the branching ratio in @xmath12 to @xmath1 transitions favor a @xmath1 count closer to @xmath13 than @xmath14 ,  @xcite while subsequent lda+dmft calculations  @xcite using a vertex - corrected one - crossing approximation for the auxilliary impurity problem yield results for the branching ratio in agreement with experiment  @xcite and suggest a @xmath1 occupancy of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , specific heat calculations carried out using an lda+dmft method with a perturbative @xmath16-matrix and fluctuating exchange approach to the auxiliary impurity problem also favor the @xmath17 configuration .",

    "@xcite typical tb calculations are then reduced to using tb as an interpolation scheme ; the matrix elements are determined by fitting to _ ab - initio _ calculated quantities such as the total energy and band energies . in this study",
    "tb inter - site parameter values are evaluated at inter - atomic distances out to the fifth nearest neighbor , resulting in 100 inter - site parameters and 4 on - site parameters .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit interaction is included as a perturbation , with its parameters kept fixed across the bands , although evaluated at the most important energies , namely at the respective centers of gravity of the occupied state density for each orbital type .",
    "@xcite the spin - orbit coupling adds 3 more parameters to the tb fit , resulting in a total of 107 parameters ( parameter values are available on request from the authors ) .",
    "the quality of the present tb fit for @xmath0-pu is comparable to that shown elsewhere for fcc u.  @xcite    as customary in lda+dmft calculations , eqs .",

    "needs of course the coulomb interaction as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) , but in addition , since the lda site energy defined by eq .",

    "may be estimated from the dependence of the lda site energy @xmath41 on @xmath5 occupation @xmath42 via lda constrained occupation calculations,@xcite and comparison to spectroscopic data for ions suggests uncertainties of @xmath43 ev in such results for both quantities.@xcite typical values of @xmath40 are around 4 ev for @xmath0-pu , as we also find , and this value is assumed throughout the present paper .",
    "given the sensitivity of @xmath42 to @xmath39 , on the other hand , we have chosen to adjust the parameter @xmath39 in the present work as a natural and convenient means of exploring the sensitivity of the @xmath0-pu spectra to @xmath1 occupancy .",
    "@xcite this adjustment amounts to varying the double counting term in conventional lda+@xmath2 or lda+dmft terminology .    within the dmft , the lattice problem eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) is mapped onto a multi - orbital quantum single impurity problem subject to a self - consistency condition : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the weiss function , @xmath46 is a @xmath19-independent self - energy , and the local green s function is defined as @xmath47 , where the lattice green s function reads @xmath48^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath49 the @xmath50 unit matrix and @xmath51 the chemical potential . since we have restricted strong correlation to the @xmath5 orbitals only , it is customary to take @xmath52 to have nonzero elements only within the @xmath53 @xmath5-@xmath5 block , which permits a similar reduction in the quantum single - impurity problem itself .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the off - diagonal elements in the self - energy and , by ignoring the crystal - field effect in the impurity problem , treat the @xmath54 levels as one 6-fold degenerate level and the @xmath55 as another 8-fold degenerate level .",
    "the only nonzero @xmath5-@xmath5 block self - energy reduces to @xmath56 and we need only find functions for the two spin - orbit states @xmath57 and @xmath58 . note that when no spin - orbit coupling is included , @xmath59 .",
    "correspondingly , the local green s functions is dictated by : @xmath60 it should also be noted that we neglect the crystal - field effects only at the auxiliary impurity problem , all such effects are still retained in @xmath28 , where hybridization dominates anyway .    to solve the auxiliary impurity problem ,",
    "we have employed both the hubbard - i approximation and an implementation of the qmc method that has been used to study properties of the compressed lanthanides .",
    "@xcite the former method is more approximate but much faster while the latter is more rigorous but computationally more expensive .",
    "the hubbard - i approximation is also useful in various ways : it is more applicable in the large - volume atomic limit , where it gives insight into the atomic aspects of pu ; it provides a good initial guess for the dmft(qmc ) simulations ; and it makes it possible to examine the full @xmath5-@xmath5 coulomb interaction ( all four slater integrals @xmath61 ) and its consequent term structure in dmft(hi ) in contrast to dmft(qmc ) , where it is still difficult to go beyond just the standard hubbard @xmath62 . unless specifically noted otherwise , all dmft(hi ) and dmft(qmc ) results reported in this paper include only @xmath40 in addition to the spin - orbit intraction . for the dmft(qmc ) calculations , we used 6000 sweeps per qmc iteration for the imaginary time segments @xmath63 at a temperature @xmath64 , which is about as low a temperature as is practical at the present time with qmc , and performed at least 100 iterations . to improve the input data needed for the maximum entropy ( maxent ) analytical continuation ,  @xcite at the last iteration",

    "indeed , the maxent results in figs .  [ fig : nfdep](d  f ) exhibit a splitting in the quasiparticle peak .",
    "on the one hand , we suggest that it is due to the spin - orbit interaction and the associated @xmath22-dependence induced into the self - energy .",

    "test can not probe the impact of hund s rules exchange on the quasiparticle peak near the fermi level , one might anticipate a reduced effect after such fine structure has been appropriately broadened for comparison to photoemission data .",
    "there has been much discussion of a three - peak structure within about 1 ev of the fermi level in the photoemission of pu systems : in thin layers of puse ,  @xcite thin pu layers on mg ,  @xcite single crystal pute ,  @xcite and suggested in thin film of pusi@xmath113  @xcite and pun .",
    "@xcite the presence of the structure in thin pu layers ( a few ml ) was interpreted as a result of localization effects due to low dimensionality overcoming the itinerant character of 5f electrons .",
    "@xcite more recently it has been suggested that such structure may be evident in @xmath0-pu metal itself .",
    "@xcite such structure may also be seen in dmft(hi ) calculations including the full coulomb interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](c ) , the black curve corresponds to a dmft(hi ) calculation with the @xmath1 site energy adjusted so @xmath114 . for comparison",
    "the red ( blue / shaded ) curve shows the @xmath108 ( @xmath115 ) result scaled by @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and shifted so its lowest unoccupied ( highest occupied ) state is at the fermi level .",
    "the three peaks discussed are shown labelled : @xmath118 essentially at the fermi level , and then @xmath119 and @xmath120 moving below .",
    "given the agreement between the dmft(hi ) spectra @xmath121 for @xmath114 with the composite @xmath122 ( addition not shown ) , it is evident that especially the left two peaks arise from @xmath123 term structure in the final state of @xmath124 electron removal , and that the strength of these peaks might provide a direct measure of the @xmath125 admixture @xmath126 into the @xmath0-pu ground state , and therefore of @xmath42 itself .",
    "there is little doubt that such an analysis is reasonable for some pu compounds , where precise atomic multiplet calculations were found in agreement with photoemission data in both line positions and intensities .",
    "@xcite such agreement includes cases ( cubic pute and puse ) where the three - peak structure is experimentally observed below the fermi level approximately @xmath127mev .",
    "the situation provided by a metallic environment as in @xmath0-pu is substantially different , however , and so the localized multiplet interpretation is not at all clear .",
    "an obvious concern about the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](c ) , for example , is that the self - energy used in dmft(hi ) is too atomic - like ; the differences between the dmft(hi ) and dmft(qmc ) curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfdep ] add to this concern .",
    "the nature of the peak right at the fermi level in @xmath0-pu is clearer .",
    "the low - temperature electronic specific heat in bulk @xmath0-pu metal is @xmath128 mj k@xmath129mol@xmath130 .",
    "@xcite this large , heavy - fermion - like value indicates significant @xmath1 state density at the fermi level which is consistent with the kind of kondo - like physics that dmft(qmc ) can yield , albeit possibly at temperatures below the present work .",
    "corroborating evidence comes from the photon energy dependent and temperature dependent photoemission experiments performed on clean @xmath0-pu metal surfaces ,  @xcite which strongly suggest that the first peak in the @xmath0-pu arises from @xmath1 electrons that are hybridized with the conduction electrons , which is again a typical quasiparticle feature usually found for materials with an enhanced electron mass .",
    "we report a systematic lda - dmft study of the spectral properties of @xmath0-pu with varying @xmath1 occupancy .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the spectral properties to the @xmath1 occupancy and the inherent ambiguity in defining the associated @xmath1 orbitals suggests the need to use @xmath1 occupancy as a fitting parameter in addition to the hubbard @xmath2 for dmft theories of pu and other materials . by comparing with photoemission data ,",
    "we conclude that an `` open shell '' @xmath3 configuration gives better agreement with experiment than the hypothesized `` closed shell '' @xmath131 case .  @xcite the dmft(hi ) approach , which is accurate in the localized , atomic limit , gives significantly different results from the more rigorous dmft(qmc ) method , which confirms the presence of a significant itinerant character in @xmath0-pu , especially at the fermi energy .",
    "the `` 3-peak '' structure seen within about 1 ev of the fermi level in the photoemission spectra of some pu compounds as well as metallic thin films , but which remains controversial for the bulk @xmath0-pu metal , may provide a measure of the admixture of @xmath125 character in the ground state of these materials , and therefore an additional indication of @xmath42 .",
    "however , it is not clear from the present work whether this structure should wash out in a correlated calculation for @xmath0-pu , which rigorously treats both extended and intraatomic exchange effects .",
