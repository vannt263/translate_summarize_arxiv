    "in this paper , we reanalyze mixed - state magnetization @xmath6 data that were collected on several polycrystalline bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1y@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( bi-2212 ) samples and presented in ref .",
    "the main reason is that these data contain some hidden information , which can be discovered by an appropriate analysis .",
    "we also argue that the method , which was used for the analysis of equilibrium magnetization data in @xcite , is not adequate to the experimental situation and the doping dependence of the zero - temperature value of the upper critical field @xmath7 , presented in @xcite , should be considered as unjustified .    as was demonstrated in @xcite , all numerous high-@xmath8 superconductors ( htsc )",
    "may be divided into two groups .",
    "the dependencies of the normalized upper critical field @xmath9 on @xmath10 for htsc s belonging to the same group are practically identical , while they are distinctly different between the groups .",
    "acknowledging the fact that the larger group includes a huge variety of different htsc compounds , while the second one is rather small , we shall denote the corresponding @xmath11 curves as _ typical _ and _ unusual _ , respectively .",
    "quite surprisingly , the results for two bi-2212 samples with different levels of doping , investigated in @xcite and analyzed in this work , perfectly match the corresponding @xmath11 curves for the two above mentioned groups of htsc s . as well as we are aware , it is the first observation of such a behavior in bi - based htsc s .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches , which are usually employed for evaluation of @xmath12 from experimental magnetization data @xcite .",
    "all these models assume conventional superconductivity ( an isotropic superconducting order parameter ) and a uniform sample with a zero demagnetizing factor .",
    "neither of these conditions is satisfied in polycrystalline htsc s . because the differences between theoretical assumptions and experimental situations are rarely discussed in the literature , we consider them in some details .",
    "\\(i ) _ demagnetizing factor . _",
    "if the sample magnetization @xmath13 is much smaller than an applied magnetic field @xmath14 , demagnetizing effects are usually neglected .",
    "this is not correct . if a demagnetizing factor @xmath15 , the sample magnetization can be written as @xmath16 ( in the case of @xmath17 ) , i.e. , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , independent of an applied magnetic field , temperature or the nature of the sample .",
    "demagnetizing effects are not important if only relative variations of the sample magnetization are considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the hao - clem @xcite and the vortex fluctuation @xcite models were employed for the analysis of experimental data",
    ". the absolute values of @xmath13 enter both of these models and neglecting demagnetizing effects may result in misinterpretation of experimental results .",
    "\\(ii ) _ pairing symmetry . _",
    "symmetry of the order parameter is also important . in the case of unconventional @xmath20-pairing , which is expected in htsc s ,",
    "the distribution of the order parameter around vortex cores and the corresponding contribution to the free energy is different from that for conventional superconductors .",
    "this is why theoretical calculations based on conventional @xmath21-pairing should be used with caution if they are applied for the analysis of experimental data collected on unconventional superconductors    \\(iii ) _ polycrystalline samples .",
    "_ htsc s are highly anisotropic . in such materials , if the direction of an external magnetic field does not coincide with one of the principle axes of the crystal , the magnetic induction in the sample is not exactly parallel to the applied magnetic field . in samples consisting of randomly oriented grains , this leads to an additional free energy and may influence the sample magnetization .",
    "it should also be noted that , because magnetizations of different grains are different , there is some magnetic interaction between the neighboring grains .",
    "the situation is even more complex at higher temperatures . indeed , according to calculations of brandt @xcite , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath13 is a linear function of @xmath22 ( london limit ) only in magnetic fields @xmath23 ( see also fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at temperatures , @xmath24 ,",
    "the upper limit of the magnetic field range is usually higher than this value . in this case",
    ", deviations of @xmath25 from the predictions of the london model have to be accounted for and a simple averaging , which was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not applicable .",
    "the model of thermal fluctuations of vortices @xcite , which was used for the analysis of experimental data in ref @xcite , is based on an experimental observation that , in the case of layered htsc compounds , there is a temperature @xmath26 , at which the sample magnetization does not depend on an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "as well as we are aware , the model @xcite is the only theory describing this feature . using this approach",
    ", one may evaluate the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the only parameter @xmath21 , entering the expression for @xmath29 , represents the distance between superconducting layers .",
    "this parameter may be independently evaluated as @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32 is the magnetic flux quantum ) .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath33 is always smaller than the theoretically predicted value and , contrary to the theory , @xmath34 is practically independent of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this is why the model @xcite may be considered only as a qualitative approach to the problem and the resulting value of @xmath29 may be different from the actual magnetic field penetration depth .",
    "one of possible reasons of the above mentioned disagreement between the theory and experiments is that thermal fluctuations of vortices , considered in @xcite , is not the only fluctuation effect that may contribute to the sample magnetization . as was discussed in @xcite , fluctuations of @xmath8 throughout the sample volume , which can not be avoided in htsc s , should also play an important role .",
    "cuprates are non - stoichiometric , which makes them intrinsically inhomogeneous materials",
    ". fluctuations of chemical composition can not be smaller than the corresponding statistical fluctuations in distribution of non - stoichiometric components .",
    "in real samples , however , chemical fluctuations are even stronger than the corresponding statistical numbers . taking into account that @xmath8 is strongly dependent on the level of oxygen or other dopants",
    ", we may conclude that the critical temperature must be spatially dependent .    at @xmath35 above the bulk critical temperature ,",
    "our sample can be considered as superconducting inclusions ( grains ) imbedded in normal metal .",
    "the same situation can be observed at @xmath36 in magnetic fields @xmath37 . at temperatures well below @xmath8 and in @xmath38 ,",
    "the above mentioned non - uniformity of the sample is not important and it may only lead to weak variations of the vortex density . in this case , the sample magnetization will correspond to an averaged value of @xmath12 .",
    "however , closer to the @xmath4 line , the situation is different . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 , we have only superconducting grains and the diamagnetic moment of the sample should be proportional to @xmath14 ( see eq .",
    "( 4.12 in @xcite ) . in magnetic fields close but below @xmath4 ,",
    "the superconducting order parameter @xmath40 is small in the bulk of the sample ( @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) , while it is substantially higher in the regions where local @xmath8 is higher .",
    "considering the sample magnetization , we may conclude that it consists of two diamagnetic contributions : @xmath43 ( from inclusions with higher @xmath8 ) and @xmath44 ( from the mixed state between the inclusions ) . both these contributions are approximately linear on @xmath14 .",
    "is approximately linear function down to @xmath45 .",
    "] at the same time , the derivatives @xmath46 and @xmath47 have opposite signs . at low temperatures , @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath44 vanishes at the bulk value of @xmath8 , while @xmath43 remains non - zero up to somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "in other words , it must be a temperature @xmath26 , at which @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 is temperature independent .",
    "as we could see , spatial variations of the superconducting critical temperature in inhomogeneous samples result in an effect similar to that of thermal fluctuations of vortices considered in @xcite .",
    "it is quite likely that both these effects are important and this is why the interlayer distance @xmath21 , calculated from experimental values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 as @xmath30 , is in disagreement with its experimental results .",
    "it is also possible that in polycrystalline samples , which are expected to be less homogeneous than single crystals , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are entirely determined by spatial fluctuations .",
    "here , we use a completely different method of analyzing of magnetization data . in this scaling approach , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , no particular @xmath25 dependence is assumed _ a priori _ , and it can be applied to single crystals as well as to polycrystalline samples , independent of the pairing mechanism or the sample geometry @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this analysis is that it does not provide the absolute values of @xmath12 but only its relative temperature variations .",
    "this is the prize to pay for its universality .",
    "however , if the value of @xmath12 at any temperature is established , a whole @xmath4 curve is obtained .",
    "the scaling procedure is based on the assumption that the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath53 is temperature independent . in this case , the mixed - state magnetic susceptibility may be written as @xmath54 i.e. , the temperature dependence of @xmath55 is only due to temperature variation of @xmath12 .",
    "( 1 ) is already sufficient to establish a relation between magnetizations at two different temperatures @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the upper critical field normalized by its value at some arbitrary chosen temperature @xmath58 .",
    "this equation is valid if the diamagnetic response of the mixed state is the only significant contribution to the sample magnetization .",
    "considering htsc s , however , we have to take into account their noticeable paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath59 in the normal state and its dependence on temperature . in order to account for @xmath60",
    ", we have to introduce an additional @xmath61 term in eq .",
    "according to @xcite , the resulting equation connecting @xmath62 and @xmath6 may be written as @xmath63 with @xmath64 we note that eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are rather general and they can be obtained from any model based on the ginzburg - landau theory , including the so - called nonlocal london theory and the hao - clem model . at the same time , as was discussed in @xcite , these relations remain valid even if @xmath25 is different from predictions of the conventional ginzburg - landau theory and , therefore , they are applicable to unconventional superconductors as well .    it should be noted that at temperatures close to @xmath8 , some additional contribution to @xmath13 arises from fluctuation effects . as was discussed in @xcite , the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) may also account for this contribution .",
    "however , because this contribution is not exactly proportional to @xmath14 , it can be accounted for only partially .",
    "( 3 ) can be used as the basis for the scaling procedure .",
    "the adjustable parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are obtained from the condition that @xmath67 , calculated from data collected at different temperatures , collapse onto a single master curve , which represents the equilibrium magnetization at @xmath68 @xcite . as a result",
    ", the temperature dependence of the normalized upper critical field @xmath65 is obtained . extrapolating the resulting @xmath65 curve to @xmath69 ,",
    "we can also obtain the value of the zero - field critical temperature .",
    "it was demonstrated that this scaling procedure works quite well and may be used in order to reliably obtain temperature dependencies of the normalized upper critical field @xmath9 from equilibrium magnetizations measured at different temperatures @xcite . in the following , we use @xmath70 to denote @xmath67 calculated using eq .",
    "( 3 ) in order to distinguish it from directly measured magnetization data .",
    "= 0.8    figs . 1(a ) and 1(b ) show scaled magnetization curves for two bi-2212 samples with different yttrium contents .",
    "as may be seen , the quality of scaling is almost perfect in both cases and deviations of individual data points do not exceed the accuracy of the original data as they can be taken from the figures presented in @xcite .",
    "the resulting temperature dependencies of the normalized upper critical field for these samples are shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "in order to demonstrate a weak interference between the two fit - parameters , we repeated the scaling procedure assuming @xmath71 .",
    "as may be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the difference between the two sets of data - points is insignificant ( see also @xcite ) . at the same time , because the normal - state paramagnetism in htsc s exists and it is temperature dependent , we do not see any reason to neglect @xmath66 .",
    "= 0.8    the results for a sample with the y - concentration @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the solid line represents the `` typical '' @xmath11 dependence , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and fitted to the data points by adjusting @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 k , evaluated in such a way , is close to the value given in the original publication .",
    ", evaluated as it was done in @xcite , may be considered only as approximate . ] as may be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the data points follow the solid line quite closely clearly demonstrating that this sample belongs to the above mentioned larger group of htsc s .",
    "we also note that because the @xmath65 curve for this group of htsc s is quite different from predictions of the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory @xcite ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) , the zero - temperature upper critical field @xmath7 , evaluated by employing this theory will be well above its real value .",
    "= 0.8    the @xmath11 curve for a sample with @xmath74 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , is quite different and practically coincides with those for several other htsc compounds belonging to the smaller group of htsc s .",
    "our evaluation of @xmath75 k for this sample is practically the same as the value provided in ref .",
    "we note that , although in this case @xmath11 is closer to the whh theory , the differences are still significant and this theory should not be used for the evaluation of @xmath7 .",
    "the observation that , considering temperature dependencies of @xmath12 , all numerous htsc s may be divided into two groups is remarkable .",
    "however , it is even more surprising that no any intermediate @xmath11 was observed so far .",
    "because both typical and unusual @xmath11 curves were observed in the same families of htsc s @xcite , one may assume that the level of doping is essential .",
    "a similar conclusion may also be drown from the results presented in this work .",
    "this is why it would be extremely interesting to study the transition from one type of the @xmath11 dependence to the other systematically .",
    "we also note that in this y - doped bi-2212 , an overdoped sample fall into the smaller group ( unusual @xmath11 curves ) , while in the case of y-123 only underdoped samples behave in such a way ( see fig .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the results of ref .",
    "the main result is the dependence of the zero - temperature upper critical field @xmath7 on the doping level . in order to obtained this plot , the authors had to extrapolated their @xmath4 data to @xmath76 .",
    "however , as we argue below , neither the @xmath4 curves nor their extrapolations can be considered as reliable .",
    "we also note that the @xmath4 curves presented in @xcite are quite different from our results ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "as may be seen in fig .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 data points cover a rather narrow range of @xmath10 values . in such cases , employing theoretical expressions for extrapolation of experimental data is justified only if it is esyablished that the corresponding theory is quantitatively applicable . as well as we are aware , there are no experimental proofs that the modification of the whh theory , proposed in @xcite , can be used for description of htsc s",
    ". moreover , there are no theoretical reasons to expect this .",
    "indeed , the theories @xcite are based on the conventional bcs theory and their applicability to unconventional superconductors is questionable .",
    "we also note that , considering the @xmath4 data presented in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can easily see that the data - points are in disagreement with the theoretical curves , which were used for their extrapolation .",
    "another warning is that the presented @xmath4 data do not show a tendency to vanish at @xmath77 .",
    "this is a strong indication on some drawbacks in the theory , which was used for evaluation of @xmath12 from magnetization data . as we discussed in the introduction",
    ", this theory neglects spatial fluctuations of @xmath8 and this is why it is quite likely that it is not applicable to real samples . in this case , the data , presented in fig.4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , do not represent @xmath12 and the conclusions made in this work are not actually based on the presented experimental data .    in conclusion , using an alternative approach to the analysis of experimental data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrate that , depending on the y - content , bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1y@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 samples may have qualitatively different temperature dependencies of the upper critical field .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous observations of similar behavior in other htsc compounds @xcite .",
    "another important point is that our @xmath4 curves are rather different from the results of the original publication .",
    "we argue that this disagreement between two analysis of the same experimental data is due to non - applicability of the vortex fluctuation model to description of real htsc samples ."
