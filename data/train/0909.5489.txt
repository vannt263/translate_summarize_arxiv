    "the discovery of a  kink \" in the nodal ( ( 0,0 ) - ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) ) dispersion of the high - t@xmath2 cuprates , and band renormalizations , in the form of a peak - dip - hump structure in the anti - nodal ( 0,@xmath1 ) - ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) dispersion @xcite , have attracted considerable attention in recent years . these band renormalizations are interpreted as due to electron - boson coupling , and it is believed that understanding their origin will provide information about the underlying pairing mechanism in these materials . there is still considerable debate as to the identity of the responsible bosonic mode@xcite .",
    "one proposal is coupling to an electronic mode associated with the collective mode found in neutron scattering near momentum transfers ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) , the so called magnetic resonance mode @xcite .",
    "additionally , renormalizations could also be due to coupling of electrons to damped magnons , which have less well - defined momentum structure .",
    "however , the strength of the coupling of magnons to electrons is under debate@xcite .",
    "for example , quantitative comparisons of arpes and neutron measurements on yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ybco ) have been made , and the overall strength of the coupling inferred from the data was indicated to be of sufficient strength to give rise to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "we also remark that a quantitative comparison between the neutron scattering and arpes measurements reported in ref . can be complicated by the polar surface of cleaved ybco resulting in surface reconstruction .",
    "this can produce significant differences between the bulk and surface layers of this material .",
    "moreover , a systematic examination of the effects of doping , material class , and temperature have not been thoroughly explored .",
    "in fact , given that the spin continuum arises from the cuo@xmath0 plane , one might expect the coupling to electrons to be relatively material - class independent .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known that a neutron resonance displays a material dependence , appearing at larger energies for larger t@xmath2 materials including both the single and multi - layer cuprates .",
    "this opens the possibility of linking the neutron resonance with arpes renormalizations via a material - dependent study .",
    "an alternative proposal is coupling to a spectrum of oxygen vibrational phonon modes @xcite , specifically , the @xmath5-axis out - of - phase bond - buckling oxygen vibration or b@xmath6 mode ( @xmath7 mev ) and the in - plane bond - stretching oxygen mode ( @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "this proposal has been able to account for many experimental observations including the anisotropy of the observed renormalizations@xcite , fine structure in the form of subkinks observed in the temperature dependence of the self - energy in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath9@xcite ( bi-2212 ) , and doping dependent changes in self - energy @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is further supported by recent arpes experiments that have measured an @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 isotope shift in the nodal kink position@xcite .",
    "finally , analogous features have been observed in tunneling spectra which have also been interpreted as coupling to a bosonic mode @xcite , and possibly the same mode responsible for the arpes observed kink .",
    "ref . reported an @xmath13o isotope shift of the feature in a bi-2212 sample indicating a phonon origin .    in this work",
    ", we present a review of how these two scenarios can be differentiated by studying the material , doping and temperature dependence of the band renormalizations .",
    "our focus is on how @xmath5-axis phonons provide a material dependence to the arpes kinks due to the phonon s sensitivity to local symmetry and the environment surrounding the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "we consider doping dependent changes to the renormalization in bi-2212 as well as the dependence of the renormalization within the bi and tl families as the number of cuo@xmath0 layers is varied .",
    "we will also discuss some recent arpes results on the @xmath14 layer system ba@xmath0ca@xmath3cu@xmath15o@xmath16f@xmath0 ( f0234 ) @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the inner and outer layers occupy different crystal environments resulting in differing madelung energies associated with each plane in the undoped compound .",
    "this difference drives inequivalent dopings between the two sets of layers , with one set @xmath17-type and the other @xmath18-type .",
    "the inequivalent doping in each plane generates further symmetry breaking in the layers and the el - ph coupling is expected to differ .",
    "indeed , ref . observes stronger kink features in the plane associated with the outer ( @xmath17-type ) layer of the material . here",
    ", we will discuss these observations in the context of the el - ph coupling scenario .",
    "the organization of this paper is follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the role of symmetry breaking in producing el - ph coupling to @xmath5-axis phonons and how such coupling is expected to vary with the crystal structure of the high - t@xmath2 cuprates . in section",
    "iii we present arpes data for various multi - layer cuprates in order to examine how the now the band renormalizations vary with the number of cuo@xmath0 layers , @xmath17 .",
    "energy distribution curves in the anti - nodal region of the bi and tl - families for @xmath19 and mdc dispersions for the @xmath18-bands of the f - family with @xmath20 are presented .",
    "of particular interest are the results for the single layer tl cuprate tl-2201 . here",
    ", we show that tl-2201 does not resolve the typical peak - dip - hump structures in the antinodal region despite the fact that the spin resonance mode exists in this system@xcite . in section iv the doping dependence of the nodal and antinodal dispersions for bi-2212 are presented .",
    "the renormalizations in each region behave differently as the samples are overdoped , pointing to presence of multiple bosonic modes . in section",
    "v we present a theoretical basis for understanding the self - doping phenomena in the parent compound f0234 and discuss what implications this process has on the coupling to @xmath5-axis phonons .",
    "finally , in section vi , we conclude with a brief summary and some additional remarks .",
    "in this section we discuss how @xmath5-axis phonons can be sensitive to the material environment off the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling to the in - plane bond - stretching modes are of a deformation type and the strength of the coupling depends on the cu - o bond distance .",
    "since this distance is relatively constant in all cuprates , coupling to these modes is relatively materials independent .",
    "this is not true for coupling to the @xmath5-axis bond buckling modes .",
    "since our goal is to explore the materials dependence of the band renormalizations , we will focus our attention to the @xmath5-axis modes .",
    "el - ph coupling to @xmath5-axis phonons can arise to first order from modulations in the on - site energy due to atomic site oscillation through local crystal fields .",
    "for the cuo@xmath0 planes , such crystal fields arise due to asymmetries in the environment surrounding the plane @xcite and the degree of symmetry breaking varies from material to material with the chemical environment ( number of layers and doping from the ideal stoichiometric compound ) .    in an ideally undoped single layer cuprate",
    "the structure above and below the planes is identical and little symmetry breaking occurs across the plane .",
    "the coupling to the planar @xmath5-axis modes is therefore expected to be weak in the parent compound . in the undoped multi - layer systems symmetry breaking across the outer planes can be large leading to a sizeable coupling in these layers .",
    "a second pathway for symmetry breaking occurs as the parent compounds are doped by introducing substitutional or interstitial dopant atoms in the charge reservoir area off the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "these dopants donate charge to the cuo@xmath0 plane , and cast off - plane electric fields @xmath21 that can not be effectively screened by the in - plane carriers@xcite . as a result they form charge impurities that further break symmetry across the cuo@xmath0 planes . through this mechanism , coupling to @xmath5-axis phonons can occur in single layer systems where they are normally forbidden by symmetry .     the local crystal field strength at the planar oxygen site of the outermost cuo@xmath0 plane of the hg - family of cuprates .",
    "all results have been normalized by the maximum field which occurs for the @xmath22 layer system . ]    to quantify the effect of the crystal environment in the parent systems , we calculate the local crystal field at the outermost cuo@xmath0 layer for the hgba@xmath0ca@xmath23cu@xmath23o@xmath24 ( n = 1 - 6 ) family of cuprates . to do this ,",
    "we use experimental structural data @xcite and assume an ionic point charge model with formal valences assigned to each atom . the ewald summation method @xcite is then used to perform the electrostatic sums for the electric field strength .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efields ] .    in the single layer compound the local field is zero since the cuo@xmath0 layer coincides with the plane of mirror symmetry and we have not considered dopings away from pure stoichiometry . in the double- and triple - layer compounds the value of the field rises taking a maximum for @xmath25 .",
    "after this , as the number of layers further increases , there is a general trend of decreasing field values .",
    "( we note here that the structural data for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 compounds had a large degree of error , presumably from the difficulty in sample growth . )",
    "this decrease is due to a reduction in the degree of symmetry breaking across the outer plane once the number of layers is increased beyond @xmath25@xcite .    in the limit of the infinite layer system",
    "cacuo@xmath0 the environment is symmetric around every plane . in this case",
    "the electrostatic contribution to the coupling is identically zero however steric forces introduce buckling to the plane which creates a new pathway for el - ph coupling of a deformation type@xcite .",
    "however , in terms of material dependence , such steric forces are present in all cuo@xmath0 systems and therefore do not contribute to differences between materials .",
    "the strength of the coupling to @xmath5-axis modes , such as the b@xmath6 mode , scales as @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , due to the oxygen charge transfer form factos , the b@xmath6 mode couples most strongly to antinodal electrons@xcite .",
    "therefore the behavior of the antinodal renormalization is expected to have a dramatic materials dependence if it is due to the b@xmath6 phonon .",
    "this layer dependence is expected to be different for coupling to the spin - resonance mode .",
    "therefore , by examining the change in coupling strength as one moves up in the number of layers provides a pathway for distinguishing between these two scenarios .",
    "in the previous section we discussed how the material dependence of the renormalizations is expected to arise in the various families of cuprates and how this coupling is expected to differ in the phonon and spin resonance proposals .",
    "we now wish to review the available arpes data in light of the theoretical considerations of the previous section . here",

    "as - grown tl2212 ( t@xmath2 = 107 k ) and tl-1223 ( t@xmath2 123 k ) crystals were chosen for the arpes measurements .",
    "tl-2201 crystals used in our measurement were prepared by annealing the as - grown crystal ( t@xmath2 @xmath31 30 k ) under a nitrogen flow at a temperature of 500@xmath32c , yielding a t@xmath2 of 80 k. the data were collected using a scienta r4000 photoelectron spectrometer .",

    "detailed arpes results on these compounds have been reported in ref . .",
    "although the dispersion kink along the nodal direction has been found universally in high - t@xmath2 cuprates @xcite , the momentum dependence of this renormalization feature , when moving away from the nodal direction , exhibits a material dependence@xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed recently that there is dependence on the number of cuo@xmath0 planes in the unit cell in the bi - family and , most recently , in the tl - family of cuprates@xcite . in the multi - layer compounds ,",
    "the  kink \" becomes more dramatic and eventually breaks the band dispersion into two branches : one branch with a sharp peak and another branch with a broader hump structure @xcite .",
    "the two branches asymptotically approach one another at a characteristic energy scale of 70 mev and coincide with the dominant energy scale of the kink along the nodal dispersion for nearly optimally - doped cuprates .",

    "the high background in the data of tl-1223 is probably due to the absence of a natural cleaving plane in the crystal structure .",

    "the red dashed line is a guide - to - the - eye to make the  hump \" more discernible .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the momentum dependence of the kink is quite different in the single layer compound , where the dispersion kink becomes less prominent moving away from the node .",
    "in addition , the band dispersion retains a single branch with no separation observed , unlike the case of the multi - layer compounds @xcite . as a result , no apparent peak - dip - hump structure can be seen in the edcs near the antinodal region for the single layer compounds fig .",
    "[ fig : layers]@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the layer dependent renormalization near the antinodal region is due most likely to electrons coupled to a sharp bosonic mode , whose origin is strictly constrained by the number of layers in the material . this mode is either absent , or has a negligible coupling to the electrons , in single layer compounds , but exhibits prominent coupling in the multi - layer compounds .",
    "the spin resonance mode does exist in some single layer cuprates@xcite ( notably tl-2201 by not la@xmath0cuo@xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the spin resonance mode is an unlikely candidate for the mode responsible for the renormalizations in the antinodal region . on the other hand , coupling to @xmath5-axis phonons can exhibit a very different coupling in single- and multi - layer compounds . as we have discussed , the b@xmath6 phonon couples strongly to the electrons in multi - layer compounds and weakly to electrons in single layer compounds .",
    "this mode can also reproduce the observed anisotropic momentum dependence of the renormalization in bi - layer bi-2212@xcite .",
    "we also note that the form for the b@xmath6 coupling is attractive in the @xmath35-wave pairing channel@xcite , which could be one factor enhancing t@xmath2 in the multi - layer systems .",

    "the results are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : madelung]a .",
    "for flat or dimpled ( @xmath84 ) planes , @xmath85 is positive indicating a larger site energy in the outer layer .",
    "charge is therefore expected to flow from the outer planes ( op ) to the inner planes ( ip ) and the op / ip are identified as @xmath18- and @xmath17-type respectively . as the plane is buckled outward @xmath83 is suppressed and becomes negative for @xmath86 @xmath87 at which point the identity of the planes is reversed .",
    "the filling of the ip and op , obtained from diagonalizing ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : madelung]b",
    ".    once the fillings have been obtained we uniformly transfer charge between the planes and recalculate the crystal field at the oxygen sites .",
    "the resulting fields are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : madelung]b . for",
    "a dimpled plane the electric field at the ip and op roughly follow a linear dependence on the buckling distance with the ip having only a slightly weaker field strength . in this case , the kink strength measured by arpes in the two bands would be comparable . for a buckled plane ,",
    "once the sign of the madelung potential difference changes and the identification of the planes reverses , deviations in the field strength become more pronounced .",
    "since the coupling enters as @xmath88 the @xmath17-type outer plane is expected to have a stronger kink feature , consistent with photoemission experiments .",
    "the carrier concentration of the two sets of planes , determined from the luttinger fraction , were reported in ref . with dopings of @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the @xmath18- and @xmath17-type bands .",
    "this observation , coupled with the different kink strength in each of the bands corresponds to @xmath91 @xmath87 in our calculations . for this degree of buckling ,",
    "the ratio of the crystal fields is @xmath92 and the ratio of the kink strength is @xmath93 .",
    "( the absolute value of @xmath94 depends on the form of the coupling constant @xmath95@xcite . )",
    "this ratio is slightly larger than the ratio of @xmath96 reported in ref .",
    "however the agreement is good considering the simplicity of the model .",
    "it is also clear that the inequivalent dopings can be understood from electrostatic configurations .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry in the coupling in each layer falls naturally into the @xmath5-axis phonon scenario with the strength of the coupling being further driven by the self - doping process .",
    "in this work we have presented aspects of the material and doping dependence of the dispersion renormalizations in the nodal and antinodal regions of various single- and multi - layer cuprates .",
    "we have found that the strength of the nodal kink has a strong material dependence and varies with the number of layers present in the material . in general , the kink strength mirrors t@xmath2 , taking on a maximal value in the @xmath25 compounds .",
    "the issue can be complicated further in the multi - layer cuprates , where madelung potential differences can lead to inequivalant dopings in the various layers .",
    "this can lead to further symmetry breaking across the cuo@xmath0 planes , and results in different kink strength in the different layers within the same material . using a simple tight - binding model and electrostatic calculations we have developed a picture of this phenomena in self - doped f0234 , which is consistent with recent arpes studies .",
    "the renormalization in the antinodal region also shows a marked dependence on the number of layers present in the material and is unresolved in the single layer cuprates .",
    "this result is difficult to reconcile for coupling to the spin resonance mode , which is expected not to vary with the number of layers , but is naturally explained by coupling to the b@xmath6 phonon when one considers the crystal structure of these materials .",
    "further evidence for multiple phonon modes was found in the doping dependence of bi-2212 . here",
    ", the features in the nodal and antinodal regions exhibit different behavior . once gap referenced , the energy scale in the nodal region changes from @xmath97 mev to @xmath98 mev as the sample is overdoped .",
    "this change of energy scales can not be explained by coupling to a single mode and therefore rules out the spin resonance mode , at least as the sole player . in the phonon scenario",
    "this signifies a trade - off between dominant coupling to the b@xmath6 mode near optimal doping and a dominant coupling to the bond stretching mode in the overdoped samples .",
    "the change of relative coupling is due to increased screening of the b@xmath6 mode as the carrier concentration is increased .",
    "both the doping and materials dependence presented here provides compelling evidence that a spectrum of phonon modes are responsible for both the nodal and antionodal low - energy renormalizations observed in the cuprates .",
