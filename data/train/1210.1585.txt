    "<S> the dirac spin liquid ground state of the spin 1/2 heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet has potential instabilities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been suggested as the reason why it is not strongly supported in large - scale numerical calculations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , previous attempts to observe these instabilities have failed . </S>",
    "<S> we report on the discovery of a projected bcs state with lower energy than the projected dirac spin liquid state which provides new insight into the stability of the ground state of the kagome antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the new state has three remarkable features . </S>",
    "<S> first , it breaks both spatial symmetry in an unusual way that may leave spinons deconfined along one direction . </S>",
    "<S> second , it breaks the u(1 ) gauge symmetry down to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> third , it has the spatial symmetry of a previously proposed `` monopole '' suggesting that it is an instability of the dirac spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the state described herein also shares a remarkable similarity to the distortion of the kagome lattice observed at low zn concentrations in zn - paratacamite suggesting it may already be realized in these materials .            </S>",
    "<S> many potential ground states have been suggested for the spin 1/2 kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet ; these include magnetic ordering in one of several spin patterns@xcite , a valence bond crystal with a 36 site unit cell@xcite or a 12 site unit cell@xcite , a chiral spin liquid@xcite , several kinds of @xmath0 spin liquids@xcite and an algebraic spin liquid@xcite . amongst algebraic spin liquids , </S>",
    "<S> it was shown @xcite that the @xmath1-dirac state had lowest variational energy . </S>",
    "<S> this latter state is characterized by its graphene - like dirac fermionic spinons interacting with a maxwell - like photon that characterizes singlet excitations . </S>",
    "<S> many of the other suggestions for the kagome antiferromagnet ground state can be characterized as instabilities of this dirac spin liquid ; these instabilities have been catalogued in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite the many instabilities , all variational studies we are aware of that include the @xmath1-dirac state for some choice of variational parameters have found it remarkably stable@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , large scale dmrg calculations@xcite have produced strong numerical evidence that the true ground state of the kagome antiferromagnet is a @xmath0 spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they have found the lowest known variational state with energies comparable to exact diagonalization on small clusters , a gap to all excitations and topological entanglement entropy expected of a @xmath0 spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> these results are quite surprising in light of prior studies of the u(1)-dirac state and suggest that it is unstable .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the simplest explanation of the dmrg results , as proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , is that the dirac - like spinons pair up and form a superfluid - like @xmath0 spin liquid . with this goal in mind , </S>",
    "<S> these authors catalog 20 such possible states and give explicit instructions for constructing 14 of them . unfortunately , despite searches for such a state@xcite , no @xmath0 state has been shown to be energetically favorable to the @xmath1 dirac state at the level of variational projected bcs wave functions .     </S>",
    "<S> correlations for the projected dirac spin liquid state with twisted boundary conditions ( left ) and the lowest energy projected mean field state ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> the color indicates sign and the linewidth measures the magnitude . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this letter , we revisit the projected bcs ( pbcs ) variational wave function problem on the kagome lattice and have discovered an instability of the dirac state . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , building on refs . , is to optimize over the entire set of time - reversal invariant projected bcs wave functions which are parameterized by a symmetric pairing matrix @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these states encompass the u(1 ) and z2 spin liquids , general valence bond solids , and a number of other instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find states with lower energy than the dirac state on clusters of up to 192 sites . on the 48 site cluster in particular , a carefully optimized wave function , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s ] , demonstrates that the new state breaks lattice symmetries , doubling the unit cell with a wave vector that connects the two dirac nodes . </S>",
    "<S> however it preserves a @xmath3 rotational symmetry about several lattice points giving it a distinct one dimensional character . </S>",
    "<S> it also lies very close to the dirac state with similar fluxes through the hexagons and bow ties . for these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> we believe it should belong to one of the leading instabilities proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , and have discovered that the most likely candidate is the time - reversal symmetric `` @xmath4-monopole '' . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this state can not be obtained by optimizing within the class of wave functions that do not admit pairing and therefore likely has @xmath0 global gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason and because of its @xmath3 symmetry and one dimensional character , we have dubbed this state a @xmath0 striped ( or smectic ) spin liquid crystal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss a connection between our state and zn - paratacamite with zn concentrations @xmath5 below @xmath6 whose observed distorted kagome layers@xcite has the same symmetry as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our objective is to find the ground state of the nearest neighbor spin @xmath7 kagome antiferromagnet constrained to the set of gutzwiller projected variational bcs wave functions @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the bcs pairing amplitude and @xmath11 projects these states onto the physical singly occupied hilbert space of spin wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> this set of variational ansatz includes projected slater determinants such as the @xmath1 dirac spin liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the variational search is performed by minimizing the ground state energy @xmath12 of the heisenberg spin hamiltonian on the kagome lattice using as parameters all @xmath13 real values of the pairing function @xmath14 ( building on refs . ) . to avoid only finding local minima in this energy landscape </S>",
    "<S> , we choose to start the optimization in many qualitatively different starting points by making use of the well developed projective symmetry group classification developed in the literature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will choose mean field parameters following ref . and derive a pairing matrix from these following supplemental materials(sm ) s - i and s - ii . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to start from 14 different spin liquid wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : opt](a ) shows prototypical optimization traces of the energies for each spin liquid state on the @xmath15 lattice , labeled following table ii of ref . . </S>",
    "<S> many states lie below the energy of the dirac spin liquid and the minimal energy state we find is at @xmath16 per site ( see sm s - iii for its pairing matrix ) , significantly below the dirac spin liquid energy of @xmath17 per site showing that the dirac spin liquid is not the most stable projected mean field state .    </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly surprising in light of previous studies that find the dirac spin liquid to be stable against many instabilities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations failed to find this state because they only considered short - range mean field hamiltonians , a limitation we avoid by optimizing a general pairing function that allows both long - range hopping terms and spatial symmetry breaking in the fermion hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : opt](b ) and discussed in more detail below , our approach in conjunction with enforcing @xmath1 symmetry does not lower the energy . </S>",
    "<S> but , additionally allowing the @xmath1 gauge symmetry to break down to @xmath0 does lower the energy ( left side of fig . [ fig : opt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the gauge symmetry breaking down to @xmath0 is intricately linked to spatial symmetry breaking and also possibly long - range hopping / pairing terms in the hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> let us then focus on the nature of our lowest energy state . </S>",
    "<S> most strikingly we find that the state breaks translational symmetry doubling the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s ] ( right ) shows the deviation of the spin - spin correlation function on nearest neighbors from its average value , in contrast with the u(1 ) dirac spin liquid shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : s.s ] ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking seen in the dirac spin liquid is a finite size artifact coming from twisted boundary conditions in one direction . in our optimized state </S>",
    "<S> we find breaking of the translational symmetry and a doubling of the unit cell leading us to conclude that the minimal projected mean field state is _ not _ an isotropic spin liquid .    to further verify that there is not a nearby isotropic spin liquid state to our optimal state </S>",
    "<S> , we stochastically modify the pairing function , starting from a low energy state , in small increments searching for a true symmetric spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we make a random stochastic change to the pairing function accepting it only if we have moved closer to a spin liquid state ( defined by the deviations of the unprojected @xmath18 ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we search for the `` closest '' spin liquid . when we run this procedure , the spin liquid state it approaches has the energy of the dirac spin liquid ( and hence is presumably the dirac spin liquid ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to believe that their is no additional nearby isotropic spin liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> having found a broken symmetry state , we would like to now understand whether it retains characteristics reminiscent of any spin liquid phase . to make such a connection , it is useful to compute the anomalous density matrix from the unprojected wave function defined by the pairing matrix that corresponds to our lowest energy projected state </S>",
    "<S> . it is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and transforms under an su(2 ) gauge transformation , @xmath21 , like @xmath22 exactly like the mean fields in the corresponding slave particle theory ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or the sm s - i ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore use this matrix to study the projective symmetry properties of the obtained unprojected state @xmath23 .    to study fluxes through the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we can use the su(2 ) matrix version of a `` phase '' variable @xmath24 that is an analog of the @xmath1 phase @xmath25 we associate with ordinary electricity and magnetism on a lattice . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> , the analog of flux through any loop on the lattice is therefore the product of this matrix around the loop @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of bonds @xmath28 that form the loop . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this product is not gauge invariant , but for every loop of the lattice , we can define an angle @xmath29 associated with its flux through the trace of this matrix . unlike a @xmath1 flux , </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath30 introduces a phase change of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the natural first loops to consider when characterizing the state @xmath32 are the nearest neighbor bow ties ( product of two neighboring triangles ) and hexagons ( the trace of @xmath33 for an odd site loop vanishes by time reversal symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> these loops allow us to determine which of the four u(1 ) spin liquid states is closest to our best optimized state . </S>",
    "<S> the results are @xmath34 where the error estimate is the standard deviation and @xmath35 denotes the average value of the flux over different hexagons or bow ties respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these results are equivalent to nearly @xmath36 flux through the hexagon and @xmath37 flux through the bow tie or triangle in the traditional @xmath1 description of flux . </S>",
    "<S> they show distinctly that the optimized state is very close to the @xmath1 dirac state as expected from energetic considerations but that because of the symmetry breaking shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig : s.s ] it is an instability . having established that our newly discovered state is very close to the dirac state , we now turn to its symmetry breaking properties . to this end , we seek the space group representations that give the largest contribution to the pattern in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : s.s](b ) which are periodic with at most a quadrupled unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> such representations were constructed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and labeled as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 for those related to the point group alone and @xmath44 , @xmath45=@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 for those allowed by a doubling / quadrupling of the unit cell . the focus of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was on the @xmath44 representation for the `` hastings valence bond crystal '' states associated with the generation of mass of the dirac fermions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bond amplitudes plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s](b ) are not of this representation . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they are dominated by the @xmath45 and @xmath43 representations whose patterns are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : symmetryanalysis ] ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the symmetry of the @xmath45 pattern alone is the same as the symmetry of the @xmath45 and @xmath43 patterns . the @xmath43 pattern alone , however , has higher symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the symmetry breaking observed here arises uniquely from a desire to form the @xmath45 pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> the only time reversal symmetric alternative to the hastings states , among instabilities of the dirac fixed point identified in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is the spin singlet / nodal triplet `` @xmath4-monopole '' that is created by a complex operator @xmath49 , @xmath50@xcite . in sm s - iv </S>",
    "<S> we show , following the transformation properties determined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that the six dimensional vector @xmath51 transforms under the two three - dimensional representations @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable coincidence allows us to conjecture that the @xmath4-monopole is responsible for the instability of the dirac state observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s](b ) .    to further understand the role of the symmetry breaking </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the asymmetry of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : s.s ] during part of an optimization run and correlate this with the observed energy . </S>",
    "<S> we compare global asymmetry ( removing the @xmath43 representation to remove the effects of twisted boundary conditions ) defined as @xmath52 as well as the assymetry of the @xmath45 component defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 on the solid thick bonds , @xmath55 on the dashed thick bonds and zero otherwise with @xmath56 the number of nearest neighbor bonds . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : symmetryanalysis ] ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , although we see a clear symmetry breaking , lower energy states have lower asymmetry , saturating at a value ( triangle ) that is small but still above the wen dirac state ( star ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find exactly the opposite behavior for the overlap with the @xmath45 component : lower energy states have greater overlap . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the symmetry breaking associated with the @xmath45 representation is an important feature of our state throughout much of the minimization process .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to breaking the spatial symmetries of the lattice , the physical system also breaks the @xmath1 symmetry of the dirac state down to a @xmath0 symmetry . to study this symmetry breaking we produced a series of runs without any pairing in the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we initialize twelve runs by taking the dirac pairing function and multiplying each element by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is sampled in the interval @xmath59 $ ] . using @xmath60 we ran 12 simulations </S>",
    "<S> whose variation in initial energy was significant starting as high as @xmath61 per site . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations converged to @xmath62 , the energy of the dirac state . from these results </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the dirac state lies at the bottom of a deep and wide region in orbital space and that the pairing of spinons is necessary to produce the state shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s.s](b ) .    based on our results </S>",
    "<S> , it seems very likely that the dirac fixed point is unstable to the formation of a stripe - like spin - liquid crystal phase . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion rests on two assumptions : that fluctuations beyond those captured by the projected wave function do not restore the symmetry and that this symmetry breaking is not a finite size effect . </S>",
    "<S> we have some indirect evidence supporting the latter assumption . </S>",
    "<S> dmrg and exact diagonalization results indicate that a 4x4 unit cell cluster should be large enough to capture the qualitative physics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have looked at up to 8x8 unit cell clusters and can still find states with lower energy than the dirac state . </S>",
    "<S> one way to directly address these assumptions would be to perform a psg analysis on the relevant lower symmetry subgroup of the kagome lattice and use it to search for the state that projects to our state ( we can not do this directly because projection is a many - to - one mapping and can not be inverted ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis would allow a determination of the finite size scaling of the symmetry breaking effects and provide a starting point for studying fluctuations about this phase in a low energy effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> this would also establish more directly the question of whether there is an energy gap ( however , we expect such a gap because the wave vector of the symmetry breaking pattern connects the dirac nodes of the brillouin zone ) .    </S>",
    "<S> given the lack of evidence in large - scale dmrg calculations for our state , it is unlikely to represent the true ground state . </S>",
    "<S> however , since it lies very close by and involves a minimal loss of crystal symmetries , it seems likely to be a leading instability . in particular , small perturbations to the hamiltonian could stabilize it suggesting it could be realized in nature . one promising class of materials are the zn - paratacamite family parameterized by zn doping concentration @xmath5 with @xmath63 . unlike the structurally perfect kagome lattice of the @xmath64 herbertsmithite member of the family , </S>",
    "<S> compounds with @xmath63 , including clinoatacamite at @xmath65 , break crystal symmetries and have distorted kagome layers@xcite with precisely the distortion expected from the symmetry breaking of our state . </S>",
    "<S> our results therefore motivate the study of single crystals of these materials and suggests that either the mysterious intermediate phase below @xmath66 or the high temperature phase @xmath67 could still have spinons as low energy excitations that are delocalized along the `` rails '' of the distorted lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable implication of our results is its suggestion that spin liquid crystal phases may be a common phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> since any dimer state is the exact ground state at the mean field level@xcite , projection must introduce quantum fluctuations that melt such crystalline phases , take the system through a succession of more symmetric phases until , in our case , it nearly reaches an isotropic phase . </S>",
    "<S> such a picture has several implications for the dmrg calculations on the kagome lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it is known@xcite that small perturbations to the hamiltonian in dmrg ( boundary conditions , pinning fields , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> can enhance different states and lead to symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> exploring the class of perturbations that stabilize the symmetry breaking we observe here would help make a deeper connection between analytic schwinger - fermion theory and dmrg . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the observed dmrg state might be understood as a further instability of our state to a nematic spin liquid crystal , a state found recently on a triangular lattice model with ring exchange@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a nematic spin liquid phase would be indistinguishable from a spin liquid phase on long cylinders that explicitly break rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is also possible that such a putative nematic state melts into an isotropic @xmath0 spin liquid </S>",
    "<S> . more generically , our results suggest that spin liquid crystal states are common in frustrated antiferromagnets and may be found using methods similar to ours as competitive ground states in many other systems . </S>"
