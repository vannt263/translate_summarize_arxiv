    "studying the strongly correlated regime of quantum many - body systems ( qmbs ) remains a very challenging task .",
    "we do believe that most of the interesting physics associated to them can be captured by simple models described through hamiltonians involving interactions among only few of their constituents .",
    "however , even for such simple models , we are not capable of deriving their properties , as we still miss computational tools that are generically applicable .    in few fortunate cases ,",
    "the models constructed are exactly solvable , and almost all physical quantities can be computed exactly . when this is not the case , one needs to appeal to numerical simulations . a major obstacle to this approach is provided by the fact that the complexity of simulations increases exponentially with the number of the qmbs constituents .",
    "this means that , typically , one can only deal exactly with few ( say up to forty ) constituents .",
    "some larger qmbs can still be simulated approximately .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in weakly interacting systems , where perturbation theory ( spin - wave and its modifications ) , mean - field approaches and density functional theory are particularly successful . in all these cases , indeed , there is a small parameter  namely the interaction among constituents that can at the beginning be neglected and then systematically included in the model @xcite .",
    "the strongly interacting regime of qmbs is much more complex to address for the lack of such small parameter .",
    "however , the equilibrium properties of bosonic non - frustrated systems can be extracted using quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) techniques @xcite .",
    "frustrated and/or fermionic systems are more difficult to study , but great effort has also been dedicated to them . at present , however , different methods often provide different results so that physical properties of these models are in most cases a subject of controversy ( see i.e. @xcite vs. @xcite )",
    ".    for weakly entangled states , tensor networks algorithms ( tn ) are emerging as an alternative to other techniques such as qmc , and in some cases can also be merged with the latter to provide new numerical tools @xcite .",
    "tn aim at providing a variational ansatz to describe low - energy states of qmbs , with resources that scale at most polynomially with the number of constituents .",
    "these techniques also give access to short - time dynamics of qmbs @xcite , but for the moment still fail in describing their long - time , out of equilibrium , dynamics .    in this situation , analog quantum simulations ( aqs ) appear as an alternative tool to study qmbs @xcite .",
    "these are experimental setups with quantum constituents ( photons , ions , atoms ) that are used to encode the desired qmbs @xcite .",
    "state of the art control of these quantum systems allows also to artificially induce the desired many - body hamiltonian acting on the constituents .",
    "gauge theories are special types of qmbs , where states of the system are forced to obey local symmetry constraints .",
    "they stand at the core of our understanding of known fundamental interactions ( electro - weak , strong , and , in a broader sense , gravitational ) .",
    "they are also candidates to describe the low - energy physics of frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite . as for other qmbs ,",
    "their strong coupling regime is not completely understood : in particular , they present puzzling phases , such as , confined phases and topological phases , which escape the standard landau paradigm of phase classification .    for gauge theories , and their version defined on ( spatial ) lattices ( lgt ) , in the absence of fermions  or when the number of fermions is such that there is no sign problem one can perform monte - carlo simulations .",
    "recently , ideas about how to perform tensor network simulations of such theories , have been push forward as well @xcite .",
    "applying aqs to study gauge theories is particularly challenging since , in general , their dynamics involve hamiltonian with couplings among more than the nearest - neighbors , and more than just two - body terms .",
    "this is the reason why , at present , the community has mainly focused on simulating the effects of static non - trivial background gauge fields on the phases of the matter . in this limit , the many - body interactions can be neglected , and the effect of the gauge field reduces to a specific modifications of the kinetic term of the matter field  hopping in the lattice that only involves two - body interactions .    in this context ,",
    "most of the studies deal with ultracold atoms @xcite , and some of the theoretical proposals have been already realized in the experiments on the lattice @xcite , or , off the lattice @xcite . in optical lattice simulations",
    ", one can tailor the hopping phase / matrices properly , mainly by optical means ( but also by lattice time - modulation or rotation @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in such studies ranges from quantum hall physics , where strong magnetic fluxes  very hard to obtain in condensed matter with real magnetic field are needed @xcite , to the simulation of relativistic matter and topological insulators , or extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "a natural step further towards the full simulation of gauge theories with aqs , is to include the dynamics of the gauge fields . such aim , for instance in two dimensions , requires the engineering of at least three - body couplings in triangular lattices and four - body couplings in the more common square lattices .",
    "these kind of interactions are very difficult to induce in aqs , such as , ultracold optical lattices @xcite ) .",
    "there have already been some proposals to overcome these difficulties for abelian gauge fields using molecular states @xcite , and , more recently , becs and single atoms with internal states in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    here",
    ", we pursue an alternative solution .",
    "we propose to simulate the dynamics of gauge fields by implementing digital quantum simulations with rydberg atoms ( dqrs ) .",
    "rydberg atoms are neutral atoms that can be excited to states close to the continuum spectrum , having very strong dipolar moments .",
    "such dipoles induce long - range interactions that make possible the simultaneous interaction of several atoms together .",
    "the basic ideas for dqrs are described in @xcite and involve the presence of ancilla atoms , apart from the ones entering the hamiltonian of the system to be simulated .",
    "these are called `` control '' rydberg atoms .",
    "the other atoms , whose interaction should encode the hamiltonian to be simulated , are generally called `` ensemble '' rydberg atoms .",
    "they have to be physically arranged following the pattern of the many - body interactions appearing in the desired hamiltonian .",
    "for example , if one is trying to encode four - body interaction of the four atoms around an elementary plaquette of a square lattice , such atoms should be inside the blockade radius of a given control atom , whose dipole moment is used to implement the wanted plaquette interaction among them",
    ".    one can carry out simultaneous operations on all the atoms inside the blockade radius of a control atom , operations determined by the state of the control atom itself .",
    "this can be achieved through a laser setup involving two- and three - photons transitions . in particular",
    ", one can engineer 2d lattices where the ensemble atoms are arranged on the links , while the control atoms are at each site and at the center of each plaquette ; at same time , one can tune the lattice spacing so that all the links belonging to a plaquette and entering a site are simultaneously contained inside the blockade radius of the respective plaquette and site control qubits . with this geometry one can perform lgt simulations @xcite .",
    "in this setup , one can perform arbitrary time - evolution with the desired ( abelian ) lgt hamiltonian , and , in some simple cases , one can also accomplish dissipative quantum simulations to prepare a desired state .",
    "this is , for instance , the technique proposed for the preparation of the ground - state of the toric code in @xcite , whose low - energy physics , in the appropriate limit , can be mapped to the @xmath2 lgt .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a specific proposal to perform a dqrs of a u@xmath0 lgt in two dimensions .",
    "an important ingredient of the proposal is the choice of a specific u@xmath0 lgt where the constituents are qubits .",
    "such qubits can be represented in terms of atoms with two logical level states , such as the ones available in standard rydberg setups .",
    "the corresponding formulation of u@xmath0 lgt is also known as link model or gauge magnet @xcite .",
    "the outcomes of our proposal are multifold .",
    "first , the alternative formulation that we consider is not only more practical to be implemented  the local hilbert space is finite but also  at least it is our belief closer to the language of the qmbs community than the original hamiltonian formalism proposed by kogut and susskind @xcite . within this general framework",
    ", we show how to derive the specific @xmath3 gauge magnet we are interested in .",
    "furthemore , we introduce an exactly solvable version of gauge magnet , where we are able to provide the exact ground - state wave function .",
    "we use this example to illustrate two paradigmatic properties of gauge theories , i.e. , the absence of spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry , and the presence of charge confinement .",
    "the quantitative check that such properties hold can be used by experimentalists as a _ sine qua non _ test of the quality of the simulator .    finally , we determine a specific protocol to prepare the ground - state of the model and perform arbitrary , out of equilibrium , dynamical simulations .",
    "as well known , one can extract the excitation spectrum of the model by performing these simulations .",
    "our approach is relevant because it allows the simulation of a lgt with continuous symmetry groups away from the special points , as studied in @xcite .",
    "it provides a generalization of the techniques described in @xcite , such to permit to prepare ground - states of hamiltonians that are not frustration - free .",
    "furthermore , we explain how to perform out of equilibrium long - time - evolution of the u@xmath0 gauge magnet with a dqrs , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that our ground - state preparation scheme successfully merges several available techniques .",
    "it is , indeed , made of two steps .",
    "first , by taking advantage of the fact that the square lattice is bipartite , we decompose the hamiltonian of the gauge magnet as the sum of two hamiltonians , each of them for separated is frustration - free . this allows us to prepare the ground - state any of the two with standard dissipative protocols . the second step involves a driven evolution via dqrs to the final hamiltonian of gauge magnets . the turning on of the part of the hamiltonian that has been neglected in the first instance ,",
    "can be adiabatic or not .",
    "indeed , the efficency of the ground - state driving can be improved by following the chopped random basis ( crab ) protocol @xcite , which allows for closed - loop optimization experiment , i.e. , the preparation time is optimized recursively by running the dqrs . in this way , we manage to prepare the ground - state of the complete hamiltonian , a very complex , strongly interacting , non frustration - free , i.e. , frustrated hamiltonian . in practise",
    ", such preparation can be applied to any system governed by a local hamiltonian in bipartite lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : constr ] , we introduce the concepts necessary to formulate a lgt . in doing so",
    ", we assume that the reader is familiar with many - body quantum systems , while the knowledge of continuous or lagrangian formulation of gauge theory is not assumed .",
    "in particular , we perform a constructive derivation of the hilbert space and hamiltonian of an arbitrary abelian lgt ( this section is complemented by the examples contained in the appendix ) . in section [",
    "sect : magn ] , we review the properties of the u@xmath0 gauge magnets as a specific instance of generic abelian lgt using the language and the notation introduced in the previous section .",
    "we discuss how to split the hamiltonian in the sum of two frustration - free hamiltonians .",
    "this is a crucial step both for applying the qdrs protocol of the ground - state preparation , and for analyzing the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the presence of charge confinement .",
    "we propose these phenomena as key experimental observables to probe whether the simulator is working properly . in section [",
    "sect : ryd ] , we start by reviewing the ideas beyond digital quantum simulation and the mesoscopic rydberg gate @xcite .",
    "we discuss in detail the setup necessary to perform a dqrs of the u@xmath0 gauge magnet time - evolution , which permits the study of long - time , out of equilibrium , dynamics .",
    "we conclude by giving special emphasis on how to prepare the ground - state of the u@xmath0 gauge magnet with a mixture of dissipative and adiabatic evolution and discuss the relation between our model and standard compact u@xmath0 lgt . we propose two possible sets of measurements that can be used by the experimentalists to check both absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and charge confinement . for reader",
    "s convenience , the main features of the experimental set - up and the experimental sequence are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "we introduce an hamiltonian formulation of abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "gauge theories are generally studied in the lagrangian formulation , by introducing an action invariant under local transformations , and quantizing it via the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite . by discretizing the space - time ,",
    "one obtains a lattice description that can be treated with the tools of statistical field theories . in this formulation",
    ", the corresponding quantum hamiltonian can be derived from the transfer matrix of the model , as as originally proposed by kogut and susskind @xcite ( in the same way one can map the classical 2d ising model at finite temperature on to the quantum ising chain at the zero temperature with a transverse field @xcite ) .    here , we take an alternative route . indeed , an abelian lattice gauge theory is a particular case of a many - body quantum system , where the constituents are arranged on a lattice and the states ( and the observables ) are invariant ( as we will explain below ) under local transformations , which are elements of a given abelian group @xmath4 . starting by this operative definition , we can construct an hamiltonian for a lgt .",
    "it is worth to notice that , for a given @xmath4 , infinitely many gauge invariant theories  and",
    "hamiltonian can be defined , although many of them may be equivalent under renormalization group flow , i.e. , may share the same fixed point and critical properties . baring this consideration in mind , the basics steps to follow to construct a gauge invariant hamiltonian for a lattice system , are : i ) the choice of the gauge group @xmath4 that , as we will see , has immediate consequences on the definition of the hilbert space of the model ; ii ) the definition of the operators defining the gauge transformations ; and iii ) the determination of the set of operators that can be used to build the hamiltonian , which has to be invariant under gauge transformation .",
    "this constructive approach should sound more familiar to people working in the field of quantum many - body systems and condensed matter rather than the one originally proposed by kogut and susskind , as it is not requiring a prior knowledge of gauge theories .",
    "it also makes explicit that each of the points i)-iii ) entails a large freedom .",
    "the original kogut - susskind proposal reveals itself as a specific choice of lgt .",
    "also , using this approach one can interpret different lgt known in the literature as link models or gauge magnets @xcite as a truncated version of the original kogut - susskind proposal .",
    "we would like to mention that this approach is rooted in the celebrated works by kitaev about the toric code and quantum doubles @xcite that we follow closely . when defining the steps i)-iii ) we will explicitly construct the simplest @xmath2 lgt , so that the reader will have an immediate example on which she / he can understand the more general abstract formulation . several other examples are contained in the appendix .      _",
    "i ) the hilbert space .",
    "_ in order to construct a lgt one first need to specify the symmetry group @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the simplest choice is to consider @xmath5 , which is the group formed by two elements , @xmath6 , with the following multiplication table @xmath7 .",
    "the constituents of the lgt are attached to the links @xmath8 connecting sites @xmath9 of an oriented lattice @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the lattice is oriented means that , when addressing a link , one has not only to specify its position but also its orientation ( the direction to follow in order to walk along it , i.e. , in 2d either from left to right or from up to down or viceversa ) . the need for considering oriented lattices can be understood through the physical picture of the links as currents moving from a site to another , the orientation is the direction of the current ( and the gauge condition is the analogue of the conservation of the current at each site ) .",
    "each of the constituents attached to the oriented links is described by a vector in a local hilbert space @xmath11 .",
    "if the lattice has @xmath12 links , the global hilbert space is defined as the tensor product @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of @xmath11 is not unique , and this is the first freedom at hand in the construction of lgt . in particular , the original formulation by kogut and susskind uses as local hilbert space the group algebra @xmath14 , so that the space of constituents is the vector space generated by linear combinations of elements of @xmath4 with complex coefficients .",
    "to each element of the group @xmath4 , one associates a vector @xmath15 , with the property @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the kronecker delta . in the simplest case of @xmath2 ,",
    "the local hilbert space is generated by the two orthogonal vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and it is isomorphic to @xmath20 . in the kogut - susskind formulation ,",
    "the dimension of the local hilbert space is strictly related to the number of elements in the group .",
    "hence , it becomes infinite for continuous groups like @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we will show below , it is perfectly consistent to consider a local hilbert space whose dimension does not depend on the number of elements @xmath4 .    .",
    "the constituents @xmath21 are attached to the links @xmath8 .",

    "[ fig : def ] .",
    "since we are dealing with an oriented lattice , we also orient the states .",
    "following physical intuition of a links as currents between sites , the change of orientation corresponds to _ an inversion _ of the currents . with the standard choice of the local hilbert space as group algebra , @xmath11 = @xmath14",
    ", the physical intuition translates in associating the inverse in @xmath4 to a flip of the orientation .",
    "this can always done since the states are elements of a group that by definition have their own inverse .",
    "hence , changing the orientation of a link is equivalent to the operation @xmath25 the detailed graphical explanation of the role of the orientation is given in the appendix [ sect : z3 ] , fig .",

    "it is worth to observe that , for the guiding example of @xmath5 , the orientation plays no role since @xmath26 and @xmath27 , hence , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the only requirement on the local hilbert space , @xmath11 , needed to construct a consistent lgt , is that @xmath11 has to be isomorphic to a representation of the symmetry group @xmath4 . in particular",

    "the @xmath24 and @xmath92 operators describe magnetic and electric interactions , respectively . for the specific example of @xmath5 , both electric and magnetic fluxes can only have two values , @xmath93 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the presence in the hamiltonian of terms involving four - body interactions is a direct consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "there have been several attempts to obtain a gauge invariant hamiltonian starting from a model with only first neighbour interactions .",
    "for instance , by defining two - body hamiltonians on a coarse grained lattice @xcite , one can obtain in some case equivalent hamiltonians to those with four - body interactions .",
    "however , at the moment these type of constructions are restricted to exactly solvable models , and it is unclear how to generalize them to a generic hamiltonian , as the one we will consider in the following .",
    "thus , in this paper we stick to the idea that gauge invariance ( on square lattices ) requires four - body interactions .      up to this point , we have seen the general requirements for obtaining a lgt .",
    "that is to say , a lgt is characterized by i ) the presence of a gauge symmetry that permits to ii ) identify a subspace of the full hilbert space as the _ physical _ hilbert space where iii ) only gauge invariant operators can be considered . in order to get the original kogut - susskind proposal , we need to make specific choices for all the three points .",
    "indeed , for i ) we use as a local hilbert space the group algebra @xmath14 .",
    "this immediately implies that in ii ) the @xmath34 operators are obtained by considering the regular representation of the rotation by an element @xmath50 of group @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , in iii ) we have constructed the hamiltonian using the simplest closed path of the lattice , the plaquettes .",
    "nevertheless , any of the above choices may be changed , resulting in a different gauge theory . here",
    ", we focus on alternative choices to i ) .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath14 algebra for a continuous group is infinite dimensional , while the implementation we have in mind of lgt simulator with optical lattices can only deal with finite dimensional local hilbert spaces ( see section [ sect : ryd ] ) .",
    "our aim is to construct an abelian lgt with the smallest possible local hilbert space , independently on the number of elements of the group @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to lgt that have been called gauge magnets or link models @xcite in the literature , whose particular case is that @xmath3 lgt with finite dimensional local hilbert space .",
    "let us start by comparing those lgt to the formulation of kogut - susskind .",
    "in order to do so , let us consider again the ( possibly infinite dimensional ) local hilbert space @xmath14 . a celebrated theorem of group theory @xcite , allows us to truncate @xmath14 to a finite dimensional hilbert space , without destroying the gauge symmetric structure .",
    "the theorem states that the regular representation ( the one that acts on @xmath14 ) can be written as the direct sum of all possible irreducible representations ( with a multiplicity equal to their dimensionality ) .    as a consequence of this theorem , we are guaranteed that there is a change of basis such that the operators @xmath34 become block diagonal , @xmath94 where we have explicitly written the block structure of @xmath34 labeled by the @xmath75 irrep , and the @xmath95 are matrix elements of the irrep @xmath75 of @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we call the rotation matrix that brings all @xmath34 to the block diagonal @xmath98 , so that we can express the @xmath69 operators in the new basis as @xmath99 where the matrix @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "we call the new basis with abuse of notation @xmath102 basis .    in the @xmath102 basis , we can safely truncate the local hilbert space of the lgt without any effect on the symmetry requirements .",
    "indeed , we just have to include at least one of the diagonal blocks of @xmath34 .",
    "however , it could happen that by keeping just one block either @xmath34 or @xmath69 become trivial ( that is indeed the case for abelian theories ) .",

    "the other two lasers are such that the sum of their frequencies is exactly resonant with the transition @xmath231 when the control atom is not in the rydberg state @xmath212 , while it is off resonant when the strong dipole - dipole interaction is present ( a more accurate discussion should take into account also the effect of simultaneous rydberg excitations in the ensemble atom as done originally in @xcite ; such extra - dipole interactions can be kept under control and the functionality of the gate is not spoiled ) .",
    "together with the condition @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the smallest detuning of the @xmath23-laser from an intermediate atomic level @xmath234 , the above construction ensures that no transfer between @xmath235 and @xmath236 occurs when they are in two - photons resonance with @xmath230 , i.e. , the control is in @xmath208 ; on the contrary the transfer occurs with efficiency one in the absence of the two - photons resonance i.e. , the control is in @xmath18 .",
    "this ideal result is not spoiled once the losses due to spontaneous decay of the long - live atomic states are taken into account .    before moving to the applications of such gate to the simulation of the gauge magnets , two comments",
    "are in order .",
    "first , the mesoscopic rydberg gate can be modified to get any @xmath237 of the form @xmath238 where @xmath113 is any real number between 0 and @xmath239 , @xmath240 a generic 3-vector of modulus 1 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 the unitary transformations in each single qubit space .",
    "indeed , the @xmath113 dependence is simple obtained by considering an @xmath113-pulse for the lasers @xmath243 and @xmath23 instead of the @xmath210-pulse considered originally in the mesoscopic rydberg gate . on the other hand , in order to get the @xmath175 combination @xmath244 , the single site addressability is exploited to perform the appropriate rotation of each qubit basis .",
    "this operation obviously amounts to apply single qubit gates on the ensemble atoms before and after the @xmath4 gate .",
    "second , as originally shown in @xcite , the mesoscopic rydberg gate can be used to read out the expectation of a ( two - valued ) operator on the ensemble atoms and transfer the information to the control qubit , once combined with rotations on the control itself .",
    "indeed , let us consider the effect of the unitary transformation @xmath245\\ , g\\ , \\exp[-i\\frac{\\pi}4\\sigma^y_c],\\label{readergate}\\ ] ] once the control qubit is initialized in @xmath208 .",
    "for a generic state of the ensemble atoms @xmath246 , where with @xmath247 are eigenvectors of @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 , the final state of the control is computed to be @xmath251 .",
    "furthermore , by inverting @xmath252 , any single qubit operation applied to the control can be mapped to the ensemble state , i.e. , on the logical qubit composed by @xmath253 and @xmath254 . in case",
    "we are interested to read a more complicated operator , as in ( [ ggen ] ) , appropriate rotations of the ensemble qubits are required as well , @xmath255\\ , g'\\ , \\exp[-i\\frac{\\pi}4\\sigma^y_c]$ ] .",
    ", width=340 ]    we are now ready to discuss in full detail the protocol for the simulation of the gauge magnets .",
    "the link qubits are identified with the logical states of the ensemble atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simulator ] ) . for convenience , we choose the following relation between the @xmath256 link basis of section [ truu1 ] and the logical ( atomic level ) basis @xmath257 @xmath258 the first conceptual and practical step is to impose the gauge condition ( [ eq : gauge_cond ] ) , i.e. , to reduce the possible states of the system to the gauge invariant ones .",
    "it is worth to notice that this is equivalent to find the ( highly degenerate ) ground - state of the hamiltonian @xmath259 , with @xmath50 a generic element of @xmath105 or of u@xmath0 such that @xmath260 for @xmath261 , or for any @xmath104 , respectively . in the u@xmath0 case , we may choose @xmath262 to be @xmath263 where @xmath113 is any integer , for instance 1 .    independently of the specific election for @xmath262 ,",
    "it is , evidently , a frustration - free hamiltonian : each local term commutes with the others , and the ground - state can be obtained by minimizing each local term separately . in this situation ,",
    "a dissipative preparation of the ground - state , as originally proposed in @xcite , and applied to quantum simulation in @xcite ( for a very recent review see @xcite ) , is appropriate .",
    "the idea of dissipative preparation is very simple and corresponds to a classical cooling .",
    "that is to say that each time the local state has no minimal energy is transformed to a minimal energy eigenstate by a local operation .",
    "let us detail the procedure in the case of ( [ hcond ] ) .",
    "our aim is to read out the expectation of @xmath22 ( @xmath264 ) on the local state and to change it , for instance by flipping an ensemble qubit , if is not satisfying the gauge condition ( or equivalently @xmath265 ) .",
    "as our local state is given by the four links attached to a site and @xmath22 is a unitary operation that can be conditionally implemented ( see discussion above ) by the mesoscopic rydberg gate , the required operation is obtained with the gate sequence @xmath266 where @xmath267 , and @xmath268 is the conditional flipping of one of the links entering @xmath9 with probability @xmath269 , let say @xmath270 , @xmath271 .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , we note that the spin flip @xmath272 is not necessary projecting the local state @xmath273 to the subspace @xmath274 in one step , even for @xmath275 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath276 , it follows that @xmath277 but if @xmath278 , it is found @xmath279 has component on the @xmath160 and @xmath280 subspace with amplitudes @xmath281 and @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "that is to say , the `` energy '' is not monotonically decreasing at each step .",
    "however , the relation above is telling us that , by iterating the process , the probability of the state to be excited is exponentially suppressed , as the probability of being reheated scales like @xmath283 , @xmath284 # of steps .",
    "second , it is worth to notice that the operation @xmath285 is unitary , but the dissipation enters in the game as , in order to iterate @xmath285 , we need to reset the control qubit to @xmath286 . as explained in @xcite , such decoupling of the control dynamics can be obtained by inducing a radiative decay of @xmath287 .",
    "this implies that the final result of one dissipative iteration is a mixed state .",
    "indeed , by naming @xmath273 any initial pure local state and assuming that the control qubit is initialized in @xmath208 , the action of @xmath285 is @xmath288 where @xmath289 @xmath290 this means that , in consequence of the decay of @xmath18 to @xmath208 , the density matrix after a dissipation step evolves as @xmath291 the most efficient cooling procedure is for @xmath292 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , it is possible to show that , in the limit of small @xmath269 , the above cooling procedure is governed by a master equation of the lindblad form . by defining the jump operators @xmath293 the expansion of ( [ phi0 ] ) and ( [ phi1 ] ) in @xmath269 around @xmath294 takes the form @xmath295 which implies that the variation of @xmath296 after one cooling step can be written up to second order in @xmath269 as @xmath297 + \\varphi^2 \\left ( c_0 \\rho c_0 + c_1 \\rho c_1^\\dagger - \\frac 12 \\{(c_0 ^ 2+c_1^\\dagger c_1),\\rho\\ }",
    "\\right ) + o(\\varphi^3),\\ ] ] where @xmath298 is the time needed for a the single time step .",
    "it is immediate to see that the above equation has no other fixed points than a density matrix built up of pure states , @xmath299 , satisfying @xmath300 . in comparison",
    "to @xcite , we find that two jump operators are associated to the cooling procedure and the presence of a coherent term linear in @xmath269 , which is not affecting the convergence as it is zero on the gauge invariant subspace .",
    "once the gauge condition has been successfully implemented , we can focus on the dynamics of u@xmath0 gauge magnet , governed by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) . as explained above",
    ", our goal is to implement the unitary evolution @xmath301 in terms of local unitary gates @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to do it is to exploit the trotter expansion to write @xmath302 where @xmath303 and @xmath304 are the plaquette , @xmath305 , and the link @xmath306 terms , respectively . as the rydberg gate are sufficiently fast ( @xmath307 ) compared with temperatures achieved for the atoms in the lattice , the above approximation is consistent and we can treat each term as commuting in the time - evolution .",
    "let us focus first in the implementation of the link part .",
    "as the @xmath92 commute between them , such term is just a product of the single qubit rotation @xmath308 applied to each link .",
    "thus , its implementation is straightforward .",
    "on the other hand , the plaquette term is slightly more involved .",
    "the easiest way to treat this term is to expand explicitly the exponential into a sum of tensor product of @xmath175 . in order to reduce the number of terms",
    "to be simulated , we may use the trotter expansion further . as @xmath78 and @xmath309",
    "can be written as @xmath310 and @xmath311 , respectively , we have @xmath312 which gives @xmath313 now , each of the above unitaries can be implemented using rydberg gates as explained in @xcite , by applying the sequence @xmath314 for @xmath315 ( \\proj{0}\\otimes\\mathbb{1}_p + \\proj{1}\\otimes   q_p^{(j ) } ) \\exp[-i\\frac{\\pi}4\\sigma^y_c]$ ] , which is of the form of ( [ ggen ] ) .",
    "it is worth to conclude with a final remark on the preservation of gauge invariance during the above process . in principle , as the hamiltonian commutes with the gauge condition ( [ eq : gauge_cond ] ) , the time - evolution conserves the gauge condition , i.e. , it is not driving the system out of the gauge invariance subspace .",
    "in fact , in order to minimizing possible violations of the gauge condition due to dephasing it is worth to keep applying the dissipative process while other unitary operations are performed . by doing so ,",
    "the unitary evolution is not altered .",
    "we are finally ready to discuss the preparation of the u@xmath0 gauge magnet ground - state . as in the link dominated phase",
    "the ground - state is a fully polarized product state that can be efficiently prepared using single site addressing , we focus on the plaquette dominated phase .",
    "our plan is to realize in practice the procedure explained in section [ truu1 ] .",
    "hence , the idea is to construct the ground - state in two steps .",
    "first , we apply the dissipative procedure to the frustration - free hamiltonian obtained considering half of the plaquette ( for instance the yellow ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart ] ) in order to find the corresponding ground - state @xmath140 defined by ( [ eq : gs ] ) and ( [ sp1 ] ) , and , then , we drive such state , adiabatically or using the crab procedure @xcite , to the ground - state of the full plaquette hamiltonian .",
    "it is worth to notice that prior to the ground - state preparation it is not necessary to impose the gauge condition as @xmath140 is gauge invariant by construction .",
    "however , for the driving , the final remark of the previous section applies .",
    "the procedure explained above works for any chosen background of static charged matter , once the proper initial state is prepared and the right gauge condition is applied at site . as in section [ truu1 ] ,",
    "we focus on 1 ) the preparation of the ground - state in the absence of charges and on 2 ) the preparation of the ground - state in presence of two isolated + and - charges .      the preparation of the initial state to be driven can be obtained by applying the discussion of section [ diss ] to the local hamiltonian @xmath316 , @xmath317\\{yellow plaquettes}. we note that the unitary operator @xmath318 $ ] acts on the eigenvector of @xmath303 ( see definitions ( [ sp1]-[sp-1 ] ) ) as @xmath319 i.e. , in a very similar way to the star operator @xmath22 .",
    "that is to say , we can get the right dissipative process just by substituting @xmath22 with @xmath320 in the gate derived in section [ diss ] . however , the c - not gate @xmath321 is hard to be implemented exactly ( i.e. , without applying trotter approximation ) using rydberg gates .",
    "we can bypass easily such difficulty by exploiting the exact knowledge of @xmath322 , where the local state @xmath323 can be explicitly written by ordering the links of plaquette anticlockwise starting from the bottom as @xmath324 we observe that such a state is completely determined by : i ) being a combination of states with an equal number of @xmath325 and @xmath326 , ii ) being the stabilizer state of both @xmath327 and @xmath328 i.e. , satisfying @xmath329 , @xmath330 .",

    "the most direct one is to prepare the product state @xmath331 by exploiting single addressing . as an alternative",
    ", we could first impose the gauge condition and , then , repeat the dissipative procedure of section [ diss ] by choosing as local state the ( yellow ) plaquettes , as unitary operator @xmath332}^{\\otimes 4}$ ] , and as flip operator the simultaneous rotation of two plaquette s qubit by @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "indeed , the gauge condition ensures that the initial plaquette state has an even number of @xmath325 and the double flip converts states with zero o four @xmath325 in a desired state .",
    "the condition ii ) , once i ) is realized , can be achieved by applying the kraus maps for bell state pumping engineered in @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that we have prepared the state @xmath135 .",
    "hence , we have to impose by dissipation only @xmath335 on the plaquette state as @xmath336 by construction .",
    "the dissipative gate @xmath337 does the job in one step .",
    "now , we are ready to turn on the remaining plaquette interactions .",
    "this can be done by increasing the coupling constant @xmath198 in ( [ eq : ham_w ] ) _ adiabatically _ from 0 to 1 . from the digital simulation point of view",
    ", this means that unitary time - evolution procedure of section [ unievo ] has applied to the plaquette hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_w ] ) , where @xmath198 is changed smoothly , for instance linearly , from an iteration to an other .",
    "however , as first shown in @xcite and reviewed in section [ truu1 ] , in the infinite dimensional system , the plaquette dominated phase becomes gapless as @xmath198 approaches 1 , with the gap that scales as @xmath338 .",
    "this means that the adiabatic driving for a finite system is still possible but it becomes harder and harder as the dimension of the lattice increases .",
    "this implies that the ramping time has to be taken bigger and bigger . in order to reduce such time",
    ", optimal control techniques can be used . between them , the so call crab method @xcite , which has been successfully employed , for instance , to dramatically reduce the time needed to bring a superfluid gas into a mott insulator state @xcite , seems very promising as it allows for closed - loop optimization experiments .",
    "the idea is to find the optimal function @xmath339 , satisfying @xmath340 , such that after a time @xmath341 minimizes a cost function @xmath342 , which in our case is a linear combination of the energy of the driven state computed with the final hamiltonian @xmath199 and the _ fluences _ , a measure of the oscillation of @xmath339 .",
    "the novel feature of the crab method is that the optimal driving at the step @xmath343 , @xmath344 , is obtained by minimizing @xmath342 with respect to few free parameters @xmath345 in the driving probes @xmath346 .",
    "the @xmath347 are element of a favorite orthonormal basis , for instance the fourier basis @xmath348 . in order to further improve the convergence ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath349 may be randomly perturbed @xmath350 .",
    "one then feeds the result of the optimization back to the algorithm so that the final energy is improved further up to convergence .",
    "we have numerically tested the crab method up to a @xmath1 lattice , where we are still able to compute the exact ground - state for @xmath199 using exact diagonalization .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the energy of the final state of the time - evolution is monotonically decreasing with the number of iterations .",
    "since each iteration takes very long ( typically around a week on a standard pc ) we have decided to stop our optimization algorithm as soon as the final energy got well below the energy of the first excited state .",
    "this typically happens after only one optimization cycle .",
    "for the sake of comparison we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab ] the energy of the state along its time - evolution and compare it with respect to the energy of the state obtained using a linear ramp that goes from @xmath351 to @xmath199 , in the same amount of time .",

    "it can be appreciated how the linear map fails completely to deliver the desired ground - state while the crab map gets very closed to it.[fig : crab],width=302 ]",
    "in presence of two isolated + and - charges , two main difference in the preparation occur .",
    "first , the initial state to be driven , i.e. the ground - state of the system with only half of the plaquettes turned on ( the yellow sublattice of fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart ] ) , is different . indeed , as explained in section [ truu1 ] , it is again a product state of eigenvectors of the plaquettes turned on , but it differs from the ground - state in the absence of charges on few plaquettes , which we called _",
    "flipped_. on the flipped plaquettes , gauge invariance forces to take an eigenvector of eigenvalue 0 .",
    "furthermore , the flipped plaquettes can only occupy a continuous segment of a southeast - northwest diagonal of the sublattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ] .",
    "accordingly , the charges can be placed consistently with gauge invariance only on the sites of the first and last plaquette of the segment . to be precise ,",
    "a charge can occupy all the sites except the one shared with the contiguous flipped plaquette of the interior . hence , by definition the flipped plaquettes of the interior contains no charges .",
    "the position of the charges fully determines which are states on the flipped plaquettes .",
    "let assume for convenience that the positive charge is on the first flipped plaquette at the bottom - left and the negative one is on the last at the top - right .",
    "it follows that the proper state for the plaquettes in the interior of the segment is @xmath352 . for the plaquettes on the frontier we have two possibility :",
    "the charge occupies the site , @xmath353 , on the diagonal of the segment ( not shared with other flipped plaquettes ) , or it occupies one of the two off diagonal . in the former case",
    "the state is again @xmath352 . in the latter ,",
    "the link connecting @xmath353 with the site of the charge is in @xmath65 with all the other links are in @xmath119 .",
    "hence , it follows that the plaquette at the bottom - left is in the state @xmath354 if the charge is below the diagonal or in @xmath355 if the charge is above .",
    "similarly , the plaquette at the top - right is in the state @xmath356 if the charge is below the diagonal or in @xmath357 if the charge is above .",
    "such states can be easily prepared by single - site addressing or using dissipation .",
    "it is worth to notice that the configuration with the positive charge at the top - right can be obtained from the one above by combining a @xmath210-rotation of the lattice , which puts the charges in the desired configuration but reverses the orientation , with the flip of the state of each link , @xmath358 , which restores the right orientation .",
    "hence , the preparation of initial state to be driven in presence of charges does not imply much more effort than the preparation of the not - charged one .",
    "the other difference in preparation of the ground - state with charge with respect to case without is that the gauge condition to be enforced during the driving in order to minimize the error is different .",
    "indeed , on the site where @xmath93 charge is placed the gauge condition reads @xmath359 this means that the dissipative procedure has to force the eigenvalue 1 of the operator @xmath360 . by noticing that @xmath361",
    "we conclude that the correct gauge condition can be imposed via the modified version of dissipative sequence ( [ ud ] ) @xmath362 where @xmath363 , as the phase @xmath364 cancels out in the gate .",
    "once the proposed experiment has been realized , one has to be able to ensure that the simulator is indeed behaving as expected , and thus validate the results .",
    "this is in general a non - trivial task @xcite . in the case of a gauge theory simulation ,",
    "there are , however , at least two expected properties that one could use as a `` smoking gun '' of the desired physics .    first , one can check that the expectation value of any non - gauge invariant operator is zero as predicted by gauge invariance for well defined , i.e. , non anomalous gauge theories like the gauge magnet under scrutiny .",
    "the simplest of such operators are ( twice ) the hermitian and antihermitian part of @xmath78 , in the logical basis , @xmath365 and @xmath366 , respectively . verifying that the expectation value of these operators is zero for any link provides a simple necessary condition of the consistent realization of the gauge symmetry ",
    "obviously , it is saying nothing about how good is the simulation of the dynamics . in order to make the check of gauge - invariance more compelling  it is well known that while the expectation value of local operators can be reasonably close to what craved , the state can still be orthogonal to the one desired we may consider similar operators on larger support such as non - intersecting string of links , @xmath367 . the vanishing of all the @xmath368 would provide a stronger confirmation about the gauge invariance of the prepared state .",
    "it is worth to notice that , as these measurements are destructive , i.e. , they are non - commuting with the gauge - condition and with the hamiltonian , the ( ground-)state of the model has to prepare again after any of these measurements .",
    "the second important check is non destructive , and concerns the dynamics of gauge theories .",
    "as argued in section [ truu1 ] , a common mark to them is charge confinement .",
    "this can be tested by measuring the charge gap defined as the difference in energy between the ground - state with opposite @xmath93 charges and the vacuum .",
    "it requires the comparison of the ground - state energies in presence of @xmath93 static background charges at different distances .",
    "the vacuum may be thought as the limit configuration of zero displacement between the charges . as explained in section [ truu1 ] , the different ground - state preparation amount in changing the gauge symmetry condition from ( [ eq : gauge_cond ] ) to ( [ eq : charges ] ) at the two sites where the charges are located . in presence of confinement",
    ", the dependence of the charge gap upon the inter - charge distance ( for the model proposed ) has to be linear , with the proportionality factor expressing the string tension , see ( [ eq : string_tens ] ) . this measurement can be performed at both stages of the ground - state preparation .",
    "indeed , after the dissipative stage , charges should already be confined and the string tension in known to be @xmath369 . the value extracted from the experiment can , then , be used to check whether the first step of the state preparation has been successful . after the implementation of the ground - state of the full hamiltonian , for instance , via the crab optimization , charges should still be confined but with a different and unknown value of the string tension .",
    "at present , this value can not been determined with other means for sufficiently large lattices ( the string tension itself is not well - defined for small lattices ) .",
    "hence , it would be first interesting determination of the quantum simulation .      for sake of clarity",

    "an ordinary square lattice , obtained by shining the atoms with two pairs of counterpropagating lasers in the x and y direction , respectively , is sufficient to host all the atoms . if distinct atomic species for ensemble and control are considered , a more complicated superlattice structure has to be employed , as , for separate , physical ( link qubits represented by the ensemble atoms ) and ancillary ( control atoms ) degrees of freedom occupy two square lattices at @xmath370 ( see fig . [",

    ", the lattice potential has to be sufficiently high that the free hopping is suppressed ( compared with the time scale of the experiment ) : for simplicity , the atoms are assumed to be in mott state with just one atom per site . *",

    "the energy scale @xmath371 , roughly speaking the normalization of the plaquette term ( for convenient it has been fixed to 1 in our analysis ) , is limited by the trotter approximation to be much less than the inverse of the time @xmath298 in which one unitary step of time evolution is performed .",

    "indeed , the relevant operators to be evaluated are ( linear combination of ) monomials of @xmath381 , @xmath392 , both for the validation and the evaluation of the string tension .",
    "the latter requires the evaluation of the energy decomposed in the sum of commuting monomials with @xmath393 ( as explained above ) . in practice ,",
    "one starts with the control initialized in @xmath208 .",
    "once applied the unitary map @xmath252 , the control will be in the linear superposition @xmath208 and @xmath18 , reflecting which is the decomposition of the state in eigenvalues @xmath93 of @xmath394 ( see explanation below ( [ readergate ] ) ) .",
    "the control state can be measured in various ways , for instance using florescence @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the original state of the simulator has to be prepared again , as the measurement alters it . in order to get enough statistics ,",
    "the whole process has to be repeated several times .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a new derivation of the @xmath3 gauge magnet in 2 + 1 dimension as a special case of a generic abelian ltg , and discussed its phase diagram for a natural choice of the gauge invariant hamiltonian .",
    "the advantage of such derivation is that it shows explicitly that the u@xmath0 gauge magnet may be viewed as a truncated formulation of the standard kogut - susskind @xmath3 lgt theory . in particular , the amount of resources needed for the simulation is drastically reduced as the local hilbert space shrinks from infinity to 2d ( qubit ) .",
    "this allows to engineer a digital simulation of gauge magnet in optical lattices based on the latest developments in rydberg gates .    in this context , we have proposed a protocol that allows for both preparing the ground - state of the model and performing its out of equilibrium dynamics .",
    "we also discuss two possible measurements that can provide _ sine qua no _ conditions to the correctness of simulation . in order to perform a successful simulation ,",
    "one has at least check that the states obtained are gauge invariant and that static charges are confined . the determination of the string tension for the full - fledge hamiltonian of the @xmath3 gauge magnet would also provide the first non - trivial result obtained from a quantum simulator in the area of gauge theories .    our results pose interesting questions and open novel possibilities that deserve further studies .",
    "first of all , we ( re)discover that the simplest plaquette hamiltonian gives rise to confined phase , as expected , but gapless .",
    "such property distinguishes the gauge magnets from the ordinary u@xmath0 gauge theory in 2 + 1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is a consequence of novel gauge condition arising from the different choice of the hilbert space ( such choice , for instance , rules out the existence of short closed - string configurations ) .",
    "how the choice of the group representation affects universal properties like phase diagrams and phase transitions is a fundamental question that raises naturally here and is asking for solutions .    similarly , our constructive approach to gauge magnets allows an infinite class of hamiltonians built up of local terms to be considered .",
    "it is totally unknown , at the moment , whether novel phases and phase transitions are described by such models , and , for instance , whether the polyakov phase could coexist in the same phase diagram with the gapless phase we have encountered in our study .",
    "the above questions are especially stimulating as nowadays novel tools in both classical simulation algorithms and in quantum simulation may be designed and employed to find a solution .    furthermore , another interesting line of investigation is the search for analogues of the gauge magnets formulations in 3 + 1 dimensions and/or for non - abelian groups . in parallel ,",
    "the introduction of the coupling to charged matter is very appealing .",
    "as relativistic fermions are relatively easy to be simulated _ analogically _ in optical lattices , a combined digital / analogic simulation approach is desirable .",
    "_ note added_. little after the appearance of this work , @xcite appeared proposing a different way of simulating link model in optical lattices .",
    "the @xmath396 is the simplest lgt one could imagine ( apart from the percolationg lgt of @xcite ) where the orientation of the lattice is not important , since there are only two different elements of the group , the first is @xmath109 and the other is @xmath52 , which has the property that @xmath397 .",
    "the local hilbert space with spin @xmath398 is the algebra of the group and the representation matrices of the group coincide with the regular representation of the group .",
    "the regular representation is defined to be the representation in which the matrices are constructed directly from the multiplication table of the group . in order to get the representation of multiplication by a given element , one substitute the given element in the multiplication with one and all the others with zeros . for the @xmath396 case",
    "we have the following group multiplication table @xmath399 thus @xmath400 , @xmath401 .",
    "there is an important theorem relating the regular representation with the irreducible representations .",
    "this theorem states that the regular representation contains all the irreducible representations a number of time equal to their dimensions @xcite . in this case",
    ", we have two @xmath55 , @xmath402 and @xmath403 . thus the condition ( [ eq : gauge_invariant_state ] ) is projecting out half of the @xmath404 states associated to a site .      in order to show that the condition ( [ eq : gauge_invariant_state ] ) is neither trivial or empty , and how it can be implemented , we first consider the minimal lattice , made of only one plaquette .",
    "this is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] v ) .",
    "the gauge invariant hilbert space is embedded in the @xmath405 dimensional hilbert space @xmath406 due to the periodic identification of of the links on the plaquette , ( [ eq : gauge_invariant_state ] ) applied for @xmath407 implies @xmath408 since @xmath409 has eigenvalues @xmath410 .",
    "we have two possibilities @xmath411 , @xmath412 , where @xmath413 by iteratively applying all the @xmath55 on subsequent sites , one realizes that there are two allowed states and thus a generic gauge invariant state is a linear combination of them @xmath414 this formalize the naive intuition ( which has to be modified for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions @xcite ) that gauge invariant states are related to the elementary plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "the operators compatible with gauge invariance constraints are either    * product of @xmath409 on arbitrary links of the lattice * product of @xmath415 on closed paths    the simplest choice is then @xmath416 going back to the lattice formed by a single plaquette of fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] v ) we define the hamiltonian @xmath417 that is the form that the generic hamiltonian of ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) on the chosen lattice when @xmath418 . in this simple example",
    ", we see that the ground - state is given by the linear combination @xmath419 and the first excitation is given by @xmath420    we also see that the two states are separated by an energy gap ( that does not depend on the system size ) , @xmath421 on the other hand , if we consider the opposit limit of the hamiltonian of ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) and set @xmath422 , we obtain @xmath423 which ground - state becomes @xmath424 and which first excited state is @xmath425 already in this simple example we can appreciate that in the two limit considered of ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) we are in a gaped phase but the ground - states of the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : ham_conf ] ) and ( [ eq : ham_deconf ] ) have different entanglement properties .",
    "indeed , the ground - state of the latter hamiltonian is a product state , while the one of the former is locally maximally entangled , since the reduced density matrix of a single link is proportional to the identity .",
    "this reasoning can be extended to larger systems since both hamiltonians of ( [ eq : ham_conf ] ) and ( [ eq : ham_deconf ] ) are fixed point of the rg flow @xcite .",
    "the general hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) is not in general a fixed point of the rg flow . from the above discussion",
    "it is easy to accept the appearence of a phase transition at a given @xmath192 in between @xmath127 and @xmath426 that separate the domain of attraction of the rg fixed point at @xmath127 usually called the topological - deconfined phase with the one of the rg fixed point at @xmath427 usually called the confined phase .",
    "with @xmath430 sites @xmath9 and @xmath431 links @xmath8 .",
    "ii ) a many - body state of the lattice is obtained by defining a local hilbert space @xmath432 on each of the links .",
    "a state of the lattice is then a state of the tensor product @xmath433 iii ) for each site @xmath9 of the lattice we can define operators @xmath55 acting on the local hilbert space @xmath434 , where @xmath432 is the hilbert space of a link ending in @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath55 multiplies each link state @xmath435 for the @xmath34 or @xmath436 depending on the fact if the link is entering or exiting the particular site .",
    "gauge invariance is the requirement that the state @xmath437.iv ) a particular case is obtained when the local hilbert space @xmath432 is chosen to be the group algebra @xmath438 . in this case , the states are labeled by @xmath439 and changing the orientation of the link , corresponds to @xmath440 v ) a simple example of a one plaquette lattice , discussed in the main text , is worked out in details .",
    "it consists of four sites , @xmath441 and four links @xmath442 .",
    "the four elementary gauge transformations related to the four sites are explicitly introduced .",
    "[ fig : def],width=377 ]    the next step of complication is obtained by considering a @xmath428 . the main difference with respect to the @xmath2 theory is that the group algebra of @xmath443 has dimension 3 - @xmath12 for a generic @xmath105 - and not all the elements of the group are the inverse of themselves .",
    "hence , the orientation of the lattice plays a central role . from now on",
    ", we will consider two different basis , the group algebra basis @xmath444 , and the basis in which the regular representation becomes the direct sum of the irreducible representations @xmath445 .",
    "in the @xmath15-basis the @xmath34s read @xmath446 @xmath447 as done previously for @xmath448 , we can diagonalize all the @xmath120 and we pass to the basis @xmath449 , @xmath450 . in this basis @xmath451      now , let us focus on the construction of the plaquette of the hamiltonian , taking properly in account the orientation of the links .",
    "in order to do so , we have to specify the form of the @xmath78 operator for the group @xmath428 , which generalizes the @xmath454 employed for @xmath396 . in the @xmath15-basis , it is @xmath455      if we orient the plaquettes in such a way that they always have one entering and one exiting link for each site ( either anti - clockwise or clockwise ) the plaquette will meet a gauge transformation on two consecutive links but the orientation is such that the gauge transformation on these links will look like @xmath457 . since the orientation of the plaquette is different from the orientation of the gauge transformation given in fig . [",
    "fig : def ] iii ) we are multiplying one of the two links for @xmath458 instead than @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the only possibility to obtain an operator commuting with all the gauge transformations is to take again a product of @xmath78 as @xmath459=0,\\ ] ] accordingly to ( [ eq : comm_rel ] ) .",
    "it follows that the correspondent hamiltonian term , written on the anti - clockwise or clockwise oriented plaquettes ( as the one of fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] v ) ) , reads @xmath460 this is , as expected , the explicit realization of hamiltonian of ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) with @xmath195 for the group @xmath428 .",
    "it is important to notice that now the @xmath442 are the links around a given plaquette in the order of fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] v ) .",
    "once we move back to the standard orientation of the 2d space of fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] ii ) we recover the standard form @xcite @xmath461      again we can consider the ground - state of the plaquette operator for a lattice made of a single plaquette as in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] v ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath466 it is easy to realize that the eigenvalues of @xmath467 are @xmath160 or @xmath468 and its ground - state on a single plaquette is given by @xmath469 here , again we discover the emergence of gauge invariant plaquette states .",
    "their number is now @xmath470 and clearly coincide with the @xmath471 , the cardinality of the group .",
    "the plaquette hamiltonian is still gapped , but the gap , @xmath472 is now smaller than in the @xmath396 case .",
    "we can again study the opposite limit of ( [ eq : ham_ks ] ) with @xmath473 .",
    "there we see that all spins are aligned in the @xmath474 direction . as before , by passing to larger lattices , we can repeat the same reasoning and we find two different phases .",
    "in which the ground - state in a product state and the other in which it is robustly entangled . it is also known that by increasing the rank of the group a third phase appear . here",
