    "one interesting topic which arises in the study of biologically motivated neural systems is how dynamical processes affecting the synapses in different time scales can influence the collective behaviour of large neural assemblies .",
    "a well known example is the slow change in the synaptic strength due to a learning process of activity patterns , that can be modelled as a neural network which includes a hebbian prescription for the synaptic intensities  @xcite . as a consequence of this process , the network is able to retrieve previously _ learned _ patterns , mimicking the associative memory tasks which occur in the brain @xcite .",
    "the maximum number of such patterns ( @xmath0 ) , per neuron , that the network is able to store without having significant errors in the recovery task is called the critical ( or maximum ) storage capacity of the system .",
    "this capacity is commonly denoted by the ratio @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the number of neurons in the network .",
    "it is well known that the critical storage capacity is affected by certain considerations about real neural systems , such as constraints in the range of values of the synaptic strength @xcite , the mean activity level of the stored patterns @xcite , or the topology of the network @xcite .",
    "none of these works take into account , however , that the synaptic strength also varies in short - time scales producing a fluctuating response which can be depressed ( synaptic depression ) or enhanced ( synaptic facilitation ) depending on the presynaptic activity @xcite , which defines the so called _ dynamic synapses .",
    "_    short - term depression and facilitation have been proposed as dynamical processes responsible for many kinds of complex behaviour found in neural systems .",
    "for instance , recent theoretical works have reported the importance of these mechanisms in the appearance of periodic and chaotic switching between stored activity patterns  @xcite , which could be related to the oscillations between up and down cortical states  @xcite .",
    "they are also responsible for the generation of persistent activity in working memories @xcite , and enhance the detection of correlated inputs in a background of noisy activity under different conditions @xcite .",
    "synaptic depression occurs due to the existence of a _ limited _ amount of neurotransmitter vesicles in the synaptic button , ready to be released into the synaptic cleft if a presynaptic action potential ( ap ) arrives .",
    "this produces , for a high frequency stimulus , a decrease of the postsynaptic response which is a measure of the synaptic strength as is shown in  @xcite . on the other hand , synaptic facilitation takes into account the effect of the influx of extracellular calcium ions into the neuron near the synapse after the arrival of each presynaptic ap  @xcite .",
    "these ions bind to some sensor which favours the neurotransmitter vesicle depletion , in such a way that the postsynaptic response increases for successive aps @xcite .",
    "facilitation , therefore , increases the synaptic strength for high frequency presynaptic stimuli .",
    "the effect of the competition between these two a priory opposite mechanisms has been shown to be highly relevant in the emergent behaviour of attractor neural networks ( ann ) with activity - dependent dynamic synapses with a finite number of stored patterns  @xcite . however , until now the effect of such competition in the critical storage capacity has not been reported .",
    "only very recently , a few studies have analysed this particularly interesting issue for depressing synapses , and showed that the critical storage capacity of stable memory patterns is severely reduced in this case  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work was to compute the critical storage capacity of an ann , with both depressing and facilitating mechanisms competing in the synapses , to quantitatively analyse the effect of including facilitation in the system .",
    "we demonstrate that synaptic facilitation improves the storage capacity with respect to the case of depressing synapses , for a certain range of the synaptic parameters . moreover ,",
    "if the level of depression is not very large , facilitation can increase the critical storage capacity , reaching in some cases the value obtained with static synapses which is the maximum that one can obtain considering a hebbian learning rule with unbiased random patterns in a fully connected network .",
    "our results suggest that a certain level of facilitation in the synapses might be positive for an efficient memory retrieval , while the function of strongly depressed synapses could be more oriented to other tasks concerning , for instance , the dynamical processing of data .",
    "our starting point is a fully connected network of @xmath2 binary neurons whose state @xmath3 follows a probabilistic _ little _ ( parallel and synchronous ) dynamics  @xcite : @xmath4=\\frac{1}{2}\\left \\{1+\\tanh[2\\beta ( h_i({\\bf",

    ". the coefficients @xmath11 are fixed synaptic conductances , consequence of the slow learning process of @xmath12 memory patterns of activity . in the following",
    "we will choose a hebbian prescription for such learning via the standard covariance rule  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the @xmath12 stored random patterns with mean activity @xmath15 on the other hand , the variables @xmath16 appearing in @xmath17 describe the short - term depression and facilitation synaptic mechanisms , respectively .",
    "we assume that these variables evolve according to the discrete dynamics  @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 here , @xmath21 represents the maximum fraction of neurotransmitters which can be released in absence of facilitation each time a presynaptic ap arrives to the synapse , and @xmath22 are , respectively , the time constants for depressing and facilitating processes .",
    "the dynamics ( [ x]-[u ] ) allows to recover the critical storage capacity of the standard hopfield model ( @xmath23 )  @xcite for static synapses , that is , when @xmath24 . by a simple inspection of eqs .",

    "( [ x]-[u ] ) one can have some dynamical instabilities during the simulation of the map for very small time constants .",

    ", we also assume that the working temperature ( @xmath41 ) in the system is very small ( to avoid as much as possible thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "this hypothesis is reasonable because our goal is to compute maximum storage capacity , so we have to perform the limit @xmath42 one has then two possible scenarios :    * @xmath43 .",
    "the state of the system is quenched and it does not present any temporal fluctuations in @xmath44 therefore , one can assume that in each site @xmath45 takes a fixed value ( namely @xmath46 ) for all times .",

    "* @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for very low temperatures and in the steady state , the typical time interval between thermal fluctuations is very large compared with @xmath58 and @xmath59 due to the exponential dependency on @xmath60 for the probability to have such fluctuations , so between two consecutive fluctuations the condition ( [ xfs1 ] ) still holds is in the state @xmath61 ( one has @xmath62 ) the probability to fluctuate to the state @xmath63 is @xmath64 with @xmath65 given by ( [ prob ] ) , which gives @xmath66 similarly , if @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) the probability to fluctuate to the state @xmath61 is @xmath69 which is also exponentially small . ] .",

    "this implies that dynamic synapses are not only convenient for dynamical processing of information in real neurons @xcite , or to explain the appearance of global oscillations and other emergent phenomena in neural systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , an optimal balance between depression and facilitation is necessary to recover the high retrieval properties of networks with static synapses .",

    "the figure also shows the good agreement of mean - field curves and simulations ( symbols ) .",
    "the appearance of these maxima in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig3 ] can be explained due to the competition between depression and facilitation mechanisms .",
    "once the system has arrived to a fixed point of the dynamics , the effect of depression and facilitation is mainly a modification of the ( fixed ) strength of the synapses .",
    "depression produces a decrease of the synaptic strength when the presynaptic neuron is active all the time . as a consequence , and compared with the static case , the pattern destabilizes for lower values of the noise produced by the interference with other patterns .",
    "this leads to a lower critical storage capacity value  @xcite .",
    "facilitation , however , has the opposite effect as it increases the synaptic strength .",
    "therefore , facilitation can enlarge the critical storage capacity for a given level of noise with respect to the depressing case .",
    "the increase in the synaptic strength due to facilitation can only be induced until it reaches the static synapse strength limit because the product @xmath180 in ( [ lfp ] ) can not be larger than one .",
    "one can think that since these two mechanisms are regulated by different parameters , their competition would lead to the appearance of a maximum in @xmath181 this argument is not sufficient to explain the appearance of such a maximum since one has to consider that such competition affects both the signal term and the noise produced by the interference with other patterns .",
    "only the consideration of the cooperative effect of all these mechanisms can explain the appearance of a maximum in @xmath165 , as it is observed .    to measure how the relative strength of the signal compared with the noise is affected by the competition between these two synaptic mechanisms one can compute , for instance , the ratio between the signal and noise contributions to the overlap ( see eq . ( [ m ] ) ) , that is @xmath182 where we used @xmath183 and @xmath184 which is a good approximation at @xmath185 for static synapses",
    "one has @xmath186 one can now understand the maximum appearing in figure [ fig2]a , for certain values of @xmath129 and @xmath178 as a function of @xmath170 by inspection of figure [ fig2]b .",
    "if one plots @xmath187 as a function of @xmath21 one observes that it also has a maximum at a certain value @xmath188 where @xmath189 which is the value corresponding to the static synapse limit ( in the figure this corresponds , for instance , to @xmath190 for @xmath191 @xmath192 ) .",
    "therefore , it corresponds to the maximum observed in the behaviour of @xmath165 for the same value of the synaptic parameters ( see figure [ fig2]a ) . for other values of @xmath178 @xmath129 and @xmath170 the shape of the @xmath187 should be different but , similarly to the previous example , it can easily explain the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath165 as a function of all these parameters .    in general",
    ", we can see that large values of @xmath165 appear when @xmath21 and @xmath58 have moderate values , and large enough @xmath133 these values coincide qualitatively well with those described in facilitating synapses of some cortical areas , where @xmath21 is low compared with the corresponding values found in depressing synapses and @xmath58 is several times lower than @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "to have such a relatively low value for @xmath21 is important because it allows for a stronger recovery of the synaptic strength due to facilitation .",
    "in addition , it is worthy to note that obtaining high @xmath165 values is possible for a wide range of synaptic conditions , as it is shown in right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and more explicitly in fig [ fig4 ] . for instance",
    ", high capacities ( @xmath193 ) can be obtained for very different values of @xmath133 since actual synapses usually present a high heterogeneity in the degree of depression @xmath58 , and even more in the degree of facilitation @xmath129 @xcite , our results predict high values of @xmath165 for realistic conditions .",
    "this is shown in middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the high critical storage capacity is mainly obtained for a wide range of @xmath129 ( concretely , for @xmath194 ) around @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",

    "actual neural systems could , indeed , take advantage of this peculiarity to preserve a possible fine tuning of the degree of facilitation for other purposes , such as a fast dynamical processing of data , while an optimal recall of the memories is conserved .",
    "the improvement in the critical storage capacity for these realistic values ( @xmath198 , @xmath201 and @xmath200 ) in comparison with the case of only depressing synapses is highly significant . looking at bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for instance , one can see that the critical storage capacity reaches @xmath175 for the parameter values mentioned above .",

    "that is , the capacity decreases around @xmath204 of its value with facilitation .",
    "this indicates that facilitation could have a highly important role in the storage and recall of memories .    as an illustrative example of the implications of the results reported above ,",
    "let us consider a system constituted by a network of @xmath2 fully connected neurons which receive an additional weak external input during a very short period of time .",
    "the total synaptic current to each neuron @xmath6 then becomes @xmath205 if the system is in the memory phase , we expect the external input to drive the system towards a stationary attractor state @xmath206",

    "if the system is in the memory phase , the stimulus will lead the system into the @xmath213 attractor and the memory retrieval will be successful . otherwise , for large number of stored patterns , namely @xmath214 the system will fall in a _ spin - glass _ state characterized by a mixture of a high number of patterns , and the retrieval will have failed .",

    "the effect caused by dynamic synapses does not only affect the stability of fixed points of the system , which gives us the critical storage capacity , but also the dynamics of the network .",
    "this has been recently investigated for the case of a single stored pattern ( @xmath227 ) at finite temperature  @xcite . for many patterns ,",
    "however , the interference among them can influence the behaviour of the system near the attractors due to the appearance of many local minima associated to _ spin - glass _ states  @xcite . to analyse this effect",
    ", we can define the basin of attraction of an activity pattern @xmath228 as the minimal value for the initial condition , @xmath229 , that allows the system to tend to this attractor  @xcite .",
    "the measure of the basins of attraction is highly relevant because the system will not easily tend to the stored attractors if their basins are too shallow .",
    "since we know that dynamic synapses have indeed a notable effect in the dynamics of the network at finite @xmath60 , we expect them to influence the dynamics also at @xmath9 , and therefore modify the basins of attraction in some way .",
    "we have explored this issue , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the inclusion of facilitation in a network of depressing synapses leads to an increment of the basins of attraction .",
    "since basins of attraction are associated with the error - correcting ability of the system , our results show that networks with facilitating synapses are adequate for recovering patterns , even from initial conditions only weakly correlated with the patterns .",
    "one can conclude , therefore , that facilitation increases the stability of the fixed points by increasing the basins , and this leads to a higher critical storage capacity , as we have reported previously .",
    "in this work we have focused on the role of the competition between several synaptic activity - dependent mechanisms , such as short - term depression and facilitation , in the capacity of attractor neural networks to store and retrieve information codified as activity patterns .",
    "previous studies have found that depressing synapses drastically reduce the capacity of the network to properly retrieve patterns  @xcite .",
    "these results highlight the role of depression on the processing of spatio - temporal information at short time scales ( which allows for the appearance of dynamical memories ) , in detriment of its function in stable recall necessary for memory - oriented tasks .",
    "the consideration of additional potentiating mechanisms , such as synaptic facilitation , turns out to be convenient then for memory recall in these dynamical conditions , reaching in some cases the static limit @xmath230 this leads to think that synaptic facilitation could have a crucial role in the performance of memory retrieval tasks , while maintaining the well known nonlinear properties of dynamic synapses , convenient for information processing and coding @xcite .",
    "our results also indicate that the range of parameters for which facilitation allows to have a good memory performance is notably wide , and therefore , these benefits can be achieved without a precise fine tuning of the synaptic parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , it is well known that dynamic synapses , and in particular facilitating synapses , usually present a high heterogeneity in their concrete characteristics @xcite .",
    "since the conditions for which we found high critical storage capacities for random unbiased patterns ( i.e , @xmath231 ) are very general , in the framework of our model , this can support the idea that actual neural systems could indeed take advantage of this fact to perform additional tasks  which are considerably different from a dynamical point of view while the optimal access to memories is maintained .",
    "although we have derived a mean - field theory for unbiased random patterns @xmath232 there exist other mean - field approaches in the literature which can corroborate our main conclusions about storage capacity and can be useful to extend our study for other types of stored patterns .",
    "one can employ , for instance , the mean - field theory developed in  @xcite valid also for other values of @xmath233 , or the one presented in  @xcite .",
    "our approximate theory presents , however , several differences which we consider of convenience here .",
    "concretely , the fact that it allows to work with a network with temperature , even in an approximate way , represents a significant practical advantage .",
    "it could , in principle , be a good approximation for high temperatures , and preliminary results confirm this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the assumption of having the same threshold level for all neurons , as is done in  @xcite , seems to be too restrictive for the modelling of biologically motivated neural networks due to the well known variability observed in the voltage threshold of actual neurons  @xcite . in our work , however , this experimental fact is taken into account by considering a threshold @xmath10 given by ( [ threshold ] ) for each neuron and which induces the existence of the noise term @xmath234 ( which , as we have seen , has a strong effect in the behaviour of @xmath181 )    in order to treat the effect of dynamic synapses , and concretely of short - term depression and facilitation , we have employed a simple model for synapse dynamics  @xcite . the predictions of this model agree with the experimental data from cortical slices , as one can see in  @xcite ( see explanation in the results section )",
    ". however , there are more realistic models which could be used to test our results .",
    "it is known , for example , that the stochastic nature of the transmitter release could play an important role in synaptic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "models which take into account this stochasticity ( such as  @xcite ) could be used to test our results with fluctuating synapses , although the complexity of such stochastic models would not allow to develop a simple mean - field theory , even approximate .",
    "it is also known that dynamic thresholds are responsible for several complex phenomena in ann  @xcite , that could be similar to the ones observed in ann with dynamic synapses  @xcite .",
    "this could lead us to think about the influence of dynamical thresholds in the network critical storage capacity , and its relation with the results presented here . while this is an interesting issue not reported yet , it is worth noting that although dynamical thresholds also induce the appearance of oscillatory states similar to the case of dynamical synapses , a direct mathematical relation between the dynamics of thresholds , as the model reported in  @xcite and the phenomenological model of dynamical synapses by @xcite can not be derived ( see discussion about this important issue in  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , and attending to the dynamics and error - correcting abilities , the effect of synaptic depression on the basins of attraction has been previously studied @xcite . in these works , neural networks with a general inhibitory contribution are considered , and several assumptions such as a fixed threshold value for all neurons are made .",
    "on the other hand , our study considers general networks in which excitation and inhibition are treated in the same way ( in particular , our neurons are not purely excitatory or inhibitory ) , and each neuron possesses its own particular threshold value which is also in agreement with several experimental evidences @xcite .",
    "our study shows that facilitation enlarges the basins of attraction compared with the case of only depressing synapses . as a consequence , we find that a convenient balance between synaptic depression and facilitation is necessary for neural networks to work optimally at different dynamical tasks .",
    "this is in agreement with recent experimental results which show a heterogeneous level of depression and facilitation in real synapses  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the _ meyc ",
