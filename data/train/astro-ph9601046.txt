    "the detection of radio counterparts to gamma - ray bursts would provide important information on the source emission mechanism , would be likely to produce more accurate position determinations , and would give a measure of the source distance through a measurement of the dispersion delay ( palmer 1993 ) .",
    "there is , therefore , considerable interest in detecting radio counterparts to gamma ray bursts , and several searches are under way .",
    "the haystack telescope can make a unique contribution because of its high frequency capabilities and its ability to slew rapidly .",
    "the haystack telescope is optimized for operation above 1  ghz ; a recently completed upgrade ( barvainis _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) has extended operations to frequencies as high as 116  ghz .",
    "the telescope was originally designed to track objects in low earth orbit , and high slew speeds can be tolerated .",
    "any source position above the horizon can be reached from zenith within 30 seconds , and the complementary goals of high resolution and wide field of view may be achieved through rapid scanning of an area of the sky .",
    "rapid continuum mapping of large fields with the haystack telescope had not been previously attempted , and a two - week period in may 1995 was allocated to us to develop the observing techniques . at the observing frequency of 23  ghz , the beam is 1.4 arc  minutes and the gain is 0.14  k / jy .",
    "the observing frequency was chosen as a compromise between the desire to observe at as high a frequency as possible and a desire to produce a map within a reasonable period of time .",
    "the bandwidth was 160  mhz and the nominal system temperature was 140  k ; the actual system temperature depended on the elevation and weather conditions ( see below ) .",
    "error boxes were scanned at @xmath0/second in right ascension , stepping in increments of @xmath1 in declination .",
    "continuum data were sampled at 20  hz , yielding nyquist sampling in the right ascension direction and twice nyquist sampling in the declination direction .",
    "oversampling in declination was necessary because with the rapid scanning the telescope failed to settle to its commanded declination before beginning to scan in right ascension .",
    "seven batse error boxes and two ipn arcs were observed ; the observations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "each error box was scanned in several `` slices ; '' and in most cases each slice was observed more than once .",
    "observing conditions varied considerably with source elevation and as the weather changed . for presentation in table  1 we selected just one observation of each slice ; the observation selected was that with the best sensitivity .",

    "this detection limit must be corrected for the weather - dependent opacity at 23  ghz ; for the data presented here the correction is typically about 15% .    as an example of the quality of the data produced in the survey we present in figure  1 our map of part of the error box of batse  # 3598 .",
    "this map was produced by fitting a linear baseline to five - second segments of data and subtracting the fit from the central three seconds of data .",
    "the measured pixel - to - pixel rms was 0.49  jy , consistent with the expected value of 0.51  jy ( see table  1 ) .",
    "regions in which the fit was poor are evident in the map as horizontal `` streaks '' over a portion of a single row ; occasional unsampled pixels can also be seen .",
    "sources ( here , 3c273 ) appear as bright regions with the extent of the beam .",
    "further data analysis is in progress .",
    "in the preliminary analysis of the data during the observations , only 3c273 was detected ; 0552 + 398 was noted when we examined our maps for previously known , catalogued sources .",
    "no other source was detected in the maps summarized in table  1 .",
    "3c273 is in the error box of batse#3598 ( see figure  1 ) ; 0552 + 398 is in the error box of batse#3594 .",
    "the data analysis is still in progress ; careful examination of all radio maps and averaging of the data for boxes scanned more than once may yield further detections .",
    "it is possible that radio - loud agn are the sources of the gamma ray bursts .",
    "however , both 3c273 and 0552 + 398 are already known to be variable and neither had a flux density that was unusually high or low during the time of our observations .",
    "therefore , there is no compelling reason to associate either with a grb .",
    "now that the continuum mapping technique with the haystack telescope has been demonstrated , further observations of grb error boxes have been proposed . during this past summer , the telescope servo system was replaced . with the improved pointing control more rapid scanning of boxes should be possible , making feasible observations at higher frequencies .",
    "a new receiver will provide lower receiver noise at 23  ghz and allow us to observe farther from the 22  ghz water line , further increasing the sensitivity ."
