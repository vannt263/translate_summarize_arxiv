    "the decay of axial - vector mesons of @xmath1 ( nonets associated to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 and partners respectively , ( see table  [ tab : octets ] ) ) , into a pseudoscalar ( p ) and a vector meson ( v ) has received some attention from the perspective of quark models @xcite as well as using effective lagrangians of the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "much of the work have been done in @xmath9 @xcite and general structures have been developed .",
    "in particular , an interesting formulation develops starting from chiral lagrangians of pseudoscalar mesons assuming a gauge nature for the vector fields and introducing them through covariant derivatives @xcite .",
    "two main lines of work have developed using the formalisms of hidden symmetry @xcite and yang mills @xcite and connections can be done between them @xcite .",
    "work has also been done in the @xmath0 sector @xcite , although it has been applied mostly to the @xmath9 sector , particularly to the study of the @xmath10 decay .    in",
    "most of the works the vector field formalism for the vector mesons is used .",
    "there is another way to deal with spin-1 particles assigning them an antisymmetric tensor field @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the tensor and vector field formalisms stems from the difference in the vector meson propagator using tensor fields . by introducing local terms and with basic assumptions of vector meson dominance ,",
    "the two formalisms were shown to be equivalent up to @xmath11 @xcite and with only one vector field ( which is not the case studied in the present work ) .",
    "further work on the equivalence of the two formalisms , up to local terms , for general lagrangians , based on dual transformations of gauge theories , using path integral techniques , is done in @xcite .",
    "the same kind of equivalence exploring the baryon sector was seen in @xcite .",
    "the tensor formalism has proved practical in problems of chiral theory in which the vector mesons are explicitly used in the lagrangians in order to study properties of pseudoscalar meson interaction @xcite and pseudoscalar form factors @xcite , since the vector mesons are genuine resonances which remain in the large  @xmath12 limit @xcite , unlike the light scalar mesons which are dynamically generated by the meson - meson interaction itself @xcite . in chiral dynamical approaches , like the one of @xcite",
    ", they appear as poles in the driving term of the interaction .",
    "the use of the tensor formalism in this case is useful to avoid doublecounting of terms that the lowest order lagrangian would already contain should one use the vector formalism . on the other hand , if one considers the non - abelian anomaly , the lagrangian accounting for it , obtained from the gauged wess - zumino term @xcite , is naturally written in terms of vector meson fields in the vector representation although , as suggested in @xcite , it could also be represented in terms of tensor fields . this anomalous lagrangian accounts for processes which do not conserve intrinsic parity , but this is not the case in the axial - vector decay into vector and pseudoscalar .",
    "the lagrangian that we use in the present work is also written in terms of tensor fields . however , for the purpose of evaluating the @xmath13 decays , which is the main aim of the present work , using the tensor fields , or the analogous @xmath14 combination of vector field , is equivalent since the lagrangians are only used at tree level .",
    "we shall see a practical justification for the use of the tensor representation , since the use of this formalism , together with the vector meson dominance hypothesis to couple vector mesons to photons , leads to a gauge invariant amplitude in the present case which agrees with the structure and findings for the radiative decays of the @xmath2 axial - vector meson in the chiral formalism of @xcite",
    ". this would not be the case using the straight vector formalism .",
    "the main motivation for the present study is that evidence is coming that the @xmath15 vertices play a relevant role in physical processes like radiative @xmath16 decay @xcite and @xmath17 decays @xcite through sequential mechanisms involving the exchange of vector mesons .",
    "these mechanisms were shown to be important in radiative decays of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "the works of @xcite came to show that the sequential mechanism involving the exchange of axial - vector mesons also play a relevant role in these reactions . with these problems in mind",
    ", it becomes more useful to have at hand a lagrangian which combines simplicity , wide applicability and accuracy . at the same time , most of the work done , for instance those derived in a chiral formalism @xcite , pay attention to the @xmath8 meson , while the @xmath7 has received much less attention .",
    "however , both the @xmath2 and the @xmath20 mesons and their @xmath0 partners appear on an equal footing in the physical processes which we mentioned before . in order to construct the needed lagrangian , satisfying the mentioned requirements , we will assume @xmath0 symmetry and consider parity and charge conjugation of the particles .",
    "one then obtains two structures involving the commutator and anticommutator of the @xmath0 matrices associated to the v and p fields .",
    "although @xmath0 breaking terms could also be present , the results with @xmath0 symmetry prove to be accurate enough within present experimental uncertainties in the data .",
    "@xmath0 is broken anyway through the use of the physical masses .",
    "our lagrangian contains only one free parameter for the @xmath2 ( and @xmath0 partners ) and another one for the @xmath20 ( and @xmath0 partners ) decays .",
    "this is in contrast with other models which already contain three or more parameters for the @xmath2 decay @xcite . in spite of its simplicity",
    "we shall see that our lagrangians lead to good results for the partial decay widths .",
    "another issue in our study , implying a new free parameter , is the mixing angle between the strange members of the nonets , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , necessary to get the physical @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "the experimental fact that the @xmath5 decay into @xmath21 is much larger than into @xmath22 , and that the @xmath6 decay into @xmath22 is much larger than into @xmath21 , is a clear indication that there is a large mixing between the strange members of the @xmath0 nonets , because @xmath0 would imply @xmath3 and @xmath4 to have a similar amplitude for both decay modes .",
    "nevertheless , there is no consensus about the origin of this mixing angle . in @xcite",
    "a dynamical origin was speculated through the coupling of the two @xmath23 states to their decay channels , suggesting the mixing angle to be @xmath24 provided the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are degenerate before mixing . within quark models ,",
    "a possible explanation comes from the spin - orbit interaction if @xmath25 .",
    "concerning the determination of the mixing angle , most of the works have been based on the fit to the @xmath26 decays into @xmath21 and @xmath22 and/or to the ratio @xmath27 , both using symmetry arguments to relate the amplitudes or either using quark models . using @xmath26 decay data ,",
    "the fit of @xcite found an angle of @xmath28 , from data as of 1976 , and in @xcite the solutions @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 were found , but the @xmath30 solution was discarded when considering mass formulas from quark models , which can relate the masses between the @xmath32 members with the mixing angle . in this latter paper also the @xmath33 decay was considered to refine the results and the author found that the experimental data preferred the solution of @xmath29 .",
    "however , few years later the experimental results on @xmath33 decay changed and in the recent work of @xcite both the @xmath29 and @xmath31 angles were shown to be compatible with the new data . using relativized quark models",
    ", the authors of @xcite found a large uncertain value of @xmath34 from the @xmath33 branching ratio and @xmath35 from the @xmath26 decays . in @xcite , using nonrelativistic constituent quark models to obtain relations between masses , the authors found @xmath36 . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath37 model was used , which is based in the assumption that the strong decays take place through the production of a @xmath38 pair with vacuum quantum numbers , and from the @xmath26 decays a mixing angle @xmath28 was obtained . finally , fitting to charmonium and orthocharmonium decays , in @xcite a valid range for the mixing angle between @xmath39 and @xmath40 was obtained .",
    "the previous account summarizes the status of the knowledge on this mixing angle .",
    "the previous works do not use in the fits the data of other @xmath41 decays apart from the @xmath26 s , neither use information of the dynamics of the amplitude which can be acquired from a suited lagrangian . in the present work we retake the issue , in view of the accuracy that our lagrangians provides , and we apply our @xmath15 lagrangian to get the maximum obtainable information on the mixing angle from the @xmath13 data , and also the @xmath42 decay .",
    "we will use not only the @xmath26 decay data but also the known available experimental information of other @xmath13 decays which , although do not depend on the mixing angle , they depend on the couplings of the lagrangians and consequently influence the global fit .",
    "the present study has also the advantage of considering the dynamics given by our lagrangians , not only the @xmath0 relation between the couplings .",
    ".nonets of axial - vector mesons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + recently , a paper dealing with @xmath43 has appeared @xcite in which five different structures to account for the @xmath15 coupling in the tensor formalism have been derived . although the structures derived there are formally different to the one we propose , it is easy to see that at tree level the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite give an identical structure for the amplitude to that of our lagrangian and so would do a linear combination of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 , however , breaks explicitly @xmath0 symmetry and hence has no room in our @xmath0 symmetric approach . in practical terms , the results of the present work indicate that should one use the formalism of @xcite at tree level to deal with @xmath13 decay , one would obtain very good agreement with the data by taking , for instance , the @xmath44 term alone .",
    "this , of course , affects only the octet of the @xmath2 , not the @xmath20 which we have also studied here .",
    "we have addressed the decay of an axial - vector into a vector and a pseudoscalar meson looking for a lagrangian which can reproduce all existing data while making predictions for all yet unobserved allowed channels involving all the particles of the @xmath0 nonets .",
    "we found that a basic lagrangian involving commutator and anticommutator of the fields , using the tensor representation for the vector and axial - vector mesons , was rather accurate and , at the same time , simple enough to be used in intermediate steps of more complicated hadronic processes .",
    "we have also shown that the combination of our @xmath15 lagrangian with vector meson dominance leads to an amplitude for the radiative decay of the @xmath2 into @xmath49 , which formally agrees with the one obtained in the chiral formulation of vector meson and axial couplings , relating the @xmath50 parameter of the @xmath15 coupling to the @xmath51 parameter of the @xmath52 coupling in vmd and to the coefficients of the meson chiral lagrangians .",
    "the tensor formalism produces small numerical differences in the predictions for the different decays of the axial - vector mesons with respect to the vector formalism without derivatives , yet it leads naturally to a gauge invariant amplitude for the radiative decay of the @xmath2 resonance while this vector formalism leads to a non invariant one . from the studied strong",
    "decays we found three acceptable solutions for the parameters and the mixing angle of the strange axial - vectors , with two of them with angles around @xmath53 and @xmath54 degrees , slightly favored with respect the solution around @xmath55 degrees .",
    "this is the maximum information that can be obtained from all the @xmath13 present decay data .",
    "the present determination of the mixing angle has the advantage from previous works of using all the @xmath13 available decay data , not only @xmath26 decays , and of considering the dynamics given by a suitable lagrangian .",
    "regarding the prediction for unobserved channels , it is interesting to observe that all the predicted decay rates are well within the boundaries of the total decay widths . since the predictions of the three different solutions for some channels are quite different , the measurement of some of them would be most welcome in order to find out the actual mixing and the value of the coupling parameters .",
    "the simple form derived for the lagrangian has made easier the implementation of mechanisms involving exchange of axial - vector mesons which contribute in processes of radiative decays of @xmath16 and @xmath17 which had not been discussed till recently . with tests of hadronic models and particularly chiral",
    "dynamics been conducted in physical processes occurring at higher energies , an increasing attention will have to be payed to the role of axial - vector mesons .",
    "the work in the present paper makes this task easier .",
