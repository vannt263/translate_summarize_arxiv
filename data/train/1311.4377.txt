    "mesoscopic transport studies are also of high technological interest .",
    "it is sufficient to quote the development of carbon nanotube transistors @xcite , which can operate up to terahertz frequencies @xcite .",
    "several complications arise for the theoretical description of transport properties in nanodevices which are beyond solid state physics outlined in classical text - books .",
    "these include nonadiabatic effects and time dependent phenomena , as well as the wealth of properties induced by coulomb correlations . for a realistic description ,",
    "all these effects have to be treated simultaneously .",
    "this is a real challenge .",
    "nonadiabatic time dependent effects are usually treated within the framework of two - time keldysh green s functions @xcite , but the treatment of the coulomb interaction is indispensable in most cases .",
    "one can distinguish three levels of correlation effects : ( i ) weak coulomb correlation of either hartree ( electrostatic interaction ) or hartree - fock ( including spin exchange ) character , ( ii ) coulomb blockade , and ( iii ) kondo physics .",
    "the two crucial parameters that guide coulomb effects are the coupling between dot and electrodes , and the temperature . by decreasing these two parameters",
    "the coulomb effects become more and more important , the kondo physics taking place at low temperature , for a low bias voltage . to simulate the terahertz response of carbon nanotube transistors ,",
    "the treatment of weak correlation effects ( in hartree approximation ) is already a standard procedure @xcite .",
    "however , a well developed time - dependent formalism in case of strong correlation and a fortiori when coulomb - induced collective phenomena set in , deserves to be improved , and is currently a very active research area .    here",
    ", we present a formalism of non - adiabatic electron transport which is able to treat an arbitrary time - dependence of bias and gate voltages , as well as a time - dependence of the hybridization between leads and dot .",
    "the transient and steady - state properties can be evaluated , without any a priory assumption about adiabatic or sudden limits .",
    "our formalism includes the effects of coulomb correlations beyond weak - coupling treatment , and works for arbitrary on - site interaction @xmath0 .",
    "our approach is not restricted to the wide - band limit , although the presented numerical results rely on it .",
    "it treats correctly the uncorrelated ( @xmath1 ) and the atomic ( disconnected dot ) limits , but can not account for the kondo effect , albeit interplay between transient phenomena and kondo physics are very interesting issues  @xcite ,  @xcite . as a consequence the temperatures considered here are higher than the kondo temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the formalism is based on a systematic use of two - time keldysh green s functions in the hubbard i approximation ( hia )  @xcite .",
    "the key and new point lies in the proposed way to circumvent the difficulties of the usual heavy computation when dealing with two time green s functions .",
    "our approach is easy to implement and constitutes a substantial computer - time saving method .",

    "when we change all the parameters @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the time - dependence can be rather complicated ( see fig .",
    "[ pic : timedep2 ] ) , so we can focus on only one parameter .",
    "let us fix the values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 to zero and change only @xmath180 . figure [ pic : period ] depicts @xmath149 in case of a step - function characterized by @xmath183 , and with @xmath184 .     in case of step voltage for different values of @xmath180 , for @xmath185 . ]",
    "the value of the steady - state current does not change with @xmath180 : indeed in all cases the conducting channels are the same . in the meantime , the period is strongly affected by @xmath180 : the product of @xmath180 and period @xmath186 approximately satisfies @xmath187 .",
    "this can be attributed to the presence of a phase multiplier of the form @xmath188 in the expressions which determine the time dependence of the current .",
    "this result is compatible with the observation reported in ref  @xcite where the oscillations are ascribed to the electronic transitions between the lower dot state and the leads potentials .",
    "finally we can also study the temperature influence on @xmath149 .",
    "figure [ pic : temp ] depicts @xmath149 for different @xmath189 values .     in case of step voltage for different temperatures , for @xmath190 . ]",
    "moderate temperature has little influence on `` ringing '' period , but can change significantly the amplitude of these oscillations .",
    "besides , very high temperature affects the steady - state value of the current , which is attained almost instantaneously .",
    "so , it is seen that complex time - dependence is restricted to low temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to explore the case when external voltages are periodic in time and how correlations , after the transient regimes , influence the forced ones . in case of harmonic modulation we choose in - phase voltages : @xmath191 .",
    "this kind of modulation was studied before for the non - interacting case in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite with an exponential modulation of the hybridization ; it was generalized to the interacting model in the hf approximation  @xcite .",
    "such an harmonic time - dependence was also adressed in the kondo regime  @xcite@xcite .",
    "figure [ pic : timedepharm ] depicts the time dependence of the current ( top ) and dot occupancy per spin ( bottom ) in case of harmonic modulation , for the following parameters : @xmath192 , @xmath193 ( pulsation measured in @xmath194 ) , for @xmath114 and @xmath153 ( hf and hia ) .    , @xmath193 , for @xmath114 ( exact solution ) and @xmath153 . ]    , @xmath193 , for @xmath114 ( exact solution ) and @xmath153 . ]",
    "+    in hia , the modulation amplitude for dot occupancy is very slight , but not strictly zero : it stays close to 1/3 , and never reaches 2/5 , which would be expected once per period , if the system were adiabatic .",
    "eventually , in this forced regime , the current becomes periodic in time , with the same period as the external perturbation .",
    "for the chosen parameters , a rise and fall regime sets in : the higher hubbard band alternatively reaches the border and leaves the varying bias window . however a higher frequency ( about three times larger ) also emerges .",
    "as also previously argued , the hf approximation is not reliable in the transient regime , not more in the forced regime , predicting a periodic current inversion , as well as a poor estimation of dot occupancy .",
    "as previously mentioned in the harmonic regime , current and densities do not follow adiabatic predictions , even at low frequency @xmath195  @xcite . the non - adiabatic behavior is exploited in charge pumping .",
    "the idea of producing a current in the absence of any bias voltage , called pure pumping , can also be addressed within the hia . a recent paper focussed on this issue in a formalism",
    "close , but not equivalent , to the present work  @xcite .",
    "these authors truncate the hierarchy of equation of motion at the same level than detailed above , and manage also to circumvent double - time green s functions evaluation , using an auxiliary - mode expansion .",
    "it thus seemed to us interesting to make a detailed comparison between these two resembling techniques . in the footsteps of these authors",
    ", we looked at the case of a gaussian pulse gate voltage , and calculated the left current .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : gaussian - gate ] .",
    "varying the gaussian time - width @xmath196 allows to browse the cases of adiabatic and non adiabatic response .",
    "there is a qualitative agreement , and a very good quantitative consistency for rapid pulse ( low @xmath196 ) ; however some discrepancies in the adiabatic region are observed , the current being higher in our hia .",
    "the origin of this difference in not very clear for us but stems from different correlation treatment procedures ; indeed for @xmath114 our numerical procedure for arbitrary time dependence was checked by a detailed comparison with jauho s et al .",

    "a time - dependent formalism for a single level interacting quantum dot coupled to two leads has been developed within the hubbard i approximation , in a convenient and handy way for numerical evaluation .",
    "it enables us to consider general time dependences for hybridization as well as for gate or bias voltages . to validate the approach , the steady - state regime has been , in some parameter range , favorably compared with nca results .",
    "the formalism results in the appearance of two hubbard bands in the local spectral density . for those bands we introduce two green s functions , which offer the key advantage to get rid of double - time evaluation , without any a priori assumption about adiabatic or sudden limits .",
    "these bands undergo spectral weight transfers which influence the transport properties , in contrast with the rigid band frame .",
    "calculations show the influence of coulomb correlations on the current , which mainly consists in a change of amplitude .",
    "the influence on the time structure ( e.g. `` ringing '' period ) , appear to be mostly insignificant .",
    "comparisons between hubbard i and hartree - fock approximations show that the latter is insufficient to describe time - dependent transport .",
    "the presented method can also be extended beyond the wide band limit , indeed the key point consists in writing the dot green s function as a sum of two independent green s functions ; this acts upstream , before the assumption of wide band limit . to implement our formalism beyond this limit",
