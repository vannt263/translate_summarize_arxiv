    "investigating the scalar sector of qcd in the region below and around 1  gev on the lattice enables one to gain important information about the low - energy behavior of strong interactions .",
    "a few groups have addressed this problem in the recent years ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "note that carrying out simulations in the scalar sector is a very challenging task by itself as many of these states share the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "in addition , it is known that the particles , whose properties are investigated in these simulations , are resonances . consequently , in order to perform the extraction of their mass and width from the data , one has to apply the lscher approach  @xcite that implies carrying out simulations at different volumes , complicating further an already difficult problem . moreover , in case of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , the analysis has to be done by using a _ coupled - channel _ lscher equation  @xcite , which includes @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels for total isospin @xmath8 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the resonances are very close to the @xmath9 ( inelastic ) threshold , which has the unpleasant property of `` masking '' the avoided level crossing that serves as a signature of the presence of a resonance in a finite volume  @xcite .    here",
    ", one should also mention that the mass and width are not the only quantities one is interested in case of scalar resonances .",
    "the nature of these states is not well established in phenomenology and is being debated at present , with the arguments given in favor of their interpretation as tetraquark states ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , as @xmath9 molecules  @xcite , or as a combination of a bare pole and the rescattering contribution  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for more information on this issue ) . in view of the conflicting interpretations , it is interesting to study the signatures of a possible exotic behavior , e.g. , applying weinberg s compositeness condition or the pole counting criterion ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , or investigating the quark mass dependence of the resonance pole position  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to `` translate '' all these criteria into the language of lattice qcd .",
    "however , testing them in the real simulations would require much more data at different volumes and at a much higher precision than it is at our disposal at present .",
    "summarizing all the facts above , it is legitimate to ask , whether  given our present capabilities ",
    "the extraction of the properties of scalar resonances on the lattice can be realistically done with a sufficient rigor and yield clean and unambiguous results in the nearest future .    in refs .  @xcite it has been pointed out that using twisted boundary conditions in lattice simulations  @xcite can provide an important advantage in the scalar meson sector .",
    "first and foremost , varying the twisting angle @xmath10 can substitute for simulations at different volumes and provide data of energy levels , which should be fitted in order to determine the resonance pole position .",
    "note that the same effect can be achieved by carrying out simulations at a non - zero total momentum .",
    "however , whereas the components of the lattice momentum are given by integer numbers in the units of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the size of the finite box , the twisting angle can be varied continuously .",
    "another advantage is provided by the fact that twisting allows one to effectively move the threshold away from the resonance pole location . in order to illustrate this , consider an example when the @xmath13-quark is twisted in the simulations , whereas @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks still obey periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "assume , in addition , that the system is in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame .",
    "in this example , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons in the @xmath9 intermediate state acquire 3-momenta , opposite in direction and having equal magnitude , proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "hence , the energy of the ground state of the @xmath9 pair goes up , whereas the resonance , which corresponds to a true pole in the @xmath19-matrix , stays , by definition , at the same position . for the volumes , which are currently used in lattice simulations ,",
    "the upward displacement of the @xmath9 threshold would be a large effect .",
    "consequently , it could be expected that , fitting twisted lattice data , one would achieve a more accurate extraction of the resonance pole position than in the case of periodic boundary conditions , when the threshold and the resonance are very close .",
    "note that this conjecture has been fully confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite by performing fits to `` synthetic '' data sets",
    ".    there is , however , an important caveat in the arguments above . imposing twisted boundary conditions in lattice simulations",
    "implies the calculation of gauge configurations anew .",
    "this is a very expensive enterprise .",
    "the majority of simulations up to day are done by applying the so - called partial twisting , i.e. , twisting only the valence quarks and leaving the configurations the same .",
    "it can be proven ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) that in many cases the results obtained by using partial and full twisting coincide up to exponentially suppressed terms .",
    "this happens when there are no annihilation diagrams , i.e. , the diagrams where the _ valence _ quark - antiquark pair from the initial state can annihilate and a pair of the _ sea _ quark - antiquark is produced , which obey a different boundary condition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : annihilation ] ) .",
    "however , it is easy to verify that , in case of scalar mesons , the annihilation diagrams do appear .",
    "consequently , following the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite , one had to conclude that the partial twisting in this case is useless ",
    "one has either to perform a full twisting , or to give it up .     and @xmath20 with one valence and one sea quark . ]",
    "we consider this conclusion premature .",
    "one could look at the problem from a different point of view .",
    "it is definitely not possible to prove in general that in this case the partial and full twisting lead to the same result .",
    "could one find a _ modified _ lscher equation , which corresponds to the case of partial twisting ?",
    "does this equation enable one to still extract the physically interesting information about the scattering @xmath19-matrix elements in the finite volume ?",
    "if the answer to this question is yes , using partial twisting in lattice simulations can be justified .    in this paper",
    "we do not give a full - fledged solution of the problem .",
    "rather , we have chosen to concentrate on one particular example , namely , the @xmath5 , which is an @xmath19-wave resonance with the isospin @xmath0 , and solve this problem to the end .",
    "possible mixing to other partial waves is neglected .",
    "the inclusion of higher partial waves forms a subject of a separate investigation which will be carried out in the future .",
    "a brief outline of the method is as follows .",
    "it is well known that lscher s equation can be most easily derived by using non - relativistic eft framework in a finite volume  @xcite .",
    "twisting at the quark level can be straightforwardly implemented at the hadronic level : the hadrons acquire additional momenta , proportional to the twisting angle @xmath10 .",
    "the expression for the zeta - function in the lscher equation also changes in a well - defined way , whereas the non - relativistic potentials , which encode the short - range dynamics , are @xmath10-independent .",
    "all this gives the lscher equation in case of twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the case of partially twisted boundary conditions can be considered analogously .",
    "the spectrum of the effective theory now contains much more hadrons , consisting of valence , sea and ghost quarks ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "boundary conditions for each hadron are determined by the boundary conditions on its constituents , so the @xmath10-dependence of the zeta - functions , entering the lscher equation , is uniquely defined also in this case .",
    "the crucial observation , which enables one to arrive at a tractable form of the lscher equation , is that the symmetries , which are present in the theory in the infinite volume , relate the potentials in valence , sea and ghost sectors ( the masses of valence , sea and ghost quarks are taken equal ) .",
    "it can be shown that the lscher equation can be reduced to the one that contains the potentials only in the physical ( valence ) sector and can thus be used to analyze the lattice data .    the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : framework ] we describe the effective field theory ( eft ) framework for partially twisted qcd ",
    "first , in the infinite volume . in section",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] we discuss in detail the constraints imposed by the symmetries on the matrix elements of the effective non - relativistic potential . in doing this",
    ", we first neglect the neutral meson mixing beyond tree level . in section  [ sec : luescher ] the lscher equation in case of the partially twisted boundary conditions is derived .",
    "possible applications in the simulations in the scalar sector are discussed . in section  [ sec :",
    "mixing ] we clear the remaining loopholes by discussing the mixing to all orders in this framework and show that the results are not affected .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "in order to obtain the spectrum , one usually studies the behavior of certain correlators at a large euclidean time separation @xmath21 : [ eq : correlator ] c(t)=(t)o^(0)=ud| o(t)o^(0)\\ { -s_g - d^4x| ( d+m ) } , where @xmath22 stands for the gluon action functional , and @xmath23 are appropriate source / sink operators , which have a non - zero overlap with the physical states of interest . at this stage",
    ", we do not specify the explicit form of these operators  these can be , for example , quark - antiquark or two meson operators , etc .    in order to distinguish between valence and sea quarks , we use the standard trick ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) , rewriting the above path integral in the following manner [ eq : trick ] c(t)&=&ud_vd|_vd_sd|_sd_gd|_g o_v(t)o_v^(0 ) + & & \\",

    "the subscripts `` v , '' `` s '' and `` g '' stand for valence , sea and ghost quarks , the latter being described by _ commuting _ spinor fields . after performing the path integral over quarks , it is seen that the fermion determinant , coming from valence quarks , is exactly cancelled by the one from the ghost quarks , and the expression , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlator ] ) , is reproduced .    in order to describe the situation with partially twisted boundary conditions , one imposes twisted boundary conditions on the valence and ghost quarks and periodic boundary conditions on the sea quarks .",
    "the masses of all species of quarks are taken equal , in difference to the partially quenched case where @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 are matrices in flavor space .",
    "note also that we assume isospin symmetry throughout the paper @xmath26 .    in the chiral limit , the infinite - volume theory is invariant under the graded symmetry group @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of light flavors .",
    "the low - energy effective lagrangian , corresponding to the case of partially twisted boundary conditions , contains the matrix @xmath29 of the pseudo - goldstone fields @xmath30 , which transforms under this group as ulur^ , l , rsu(2n|n ) .",
    "the hermitian matrix @xmath30 has the following representation =    m_vv & m_sv^ & m_gv^ + m_sv & m_ss & m_gs^ + m_gv & m_gs & m_gg    . here ,",
    "each of the entries is itself a @xmath31 matrix in flavor space , containing meson fields built up from certain quark species ( e.g. , from valence quark and valence antiquark , from sea quark and ghost antiquark , and so on ) .",
    "the fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 are anti - commuting pseudoscalar fields ( ghost mesons ) .",
    "further , the matrix @xmath30 obeys the condition  @xcite [ eq : str ] = ( m_vv+m_ss - m_gg)=0 , where `` str '' stands for the supertrace .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian takes the form [ eq : l ] l=(_u^u^ ) -(u+u^)+ where @xmath34 is proportional to the quark mass matrix .    in the infinite volume ,",
    "the above theory is completely equivalent to ordinary chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , since the masses of the quarks of all species are set equal . in a finite volume",
    ", the difference arises due to the different boundary conditions , set on the different meson fields .",
    "these boundary conditions are uniquely determined by the boundary conditions imposed on the constituents .",
    "we do not intend to use the framework of the partially twisted chpt to carry out explicit calculations .",
    "we need this framework only to facilitate the derivation of the lscher equation . to this end , let us consider large boxes with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the lightest mass in the system ( the pion mass ) .",
    "the characteristic 3-momenta in such a box are much smaller than all masses  consequently , the system can be described by a non - relativistic eft , whose low - energy couplings are consistently matched to the relativistic theory with the lagrangian given in eq .",

    "<S> we however demonstrate that partial twisting can still be performed , despite the fact that annihilation diagrams are present . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this are delicate cancellations , which emerge due to the graded symmetry in partially quenched qcd with valence , sea and ghost quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the modified lscher equation in case of partial twisting is given .    </S>",
