    "the lvy @xmath2-stable distributions , characterized by the index of stability @xmath3 , constitute the most general class of stable processes .",
    "the gaussian distribution is their special case , corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath4 , the lvy stable distributions have power - law tails @xmath5 .",
    "there are many systems exhibiting lvy @xmath2-stable distributions : distribution function of turbulent magnetized plasma emitters @xcite and step - size distribution of photons in hot vapors of atoms @xcite have lvy tails ; theoretical models suggest that velocity distribution of particles in fractal turbulence is lvy stable distribution @xcite or at least has lvy tails @xcite . if system behavior depends only on large noise fluctuations , such noise intensity distributions can by approximated by lvy stable distribution , leading to lvy flights .",
    "lvy flight is a generalization of the brownian motion which describes the motion of small macroscopic particles in a liquid or a gas experiencing unbalanced bombardments due to surrounding atoms .",
    "the brownian motion mimics the influence of the `` bath '' of surrounding molecules in terms of time - dependent stochastic force which is commonly assumed to be white gaussian noise .",
    "that postulate is compatible with the assumption of a short correlation time of fluctuations , much shorter than the time scale of the macroscopic motion , and the assumption of weak interactions with the bath .",
    "in contrast , the lvy motions describe results of strong collisions between the particle and the surrounding environment .",
    "lvy flights can be found in many physical systems : as an example we can point out anomalous diffusion of na adatoms on solid cu surface @xcite , anomalous diffusion of a gold nanocrystal , adsorbed on the basal plane of graphite @xcite and anomalous diffusion in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "lvy flights can be modeled by fractional fokker - planck equations @xcite or langevin equations with additive lvy stable noise .",
    "nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with additive lvy stable noise have been explored quite extensive for past 15 years @xcite .",
    "such stochastic differential equations lead to fractional fokker - planck equations with constant diffusion coefficient .",
    "models with multiplicative lvy stable noise have been used for modeling inhomogeneous media @xcite , ecological population density with fluctuating volume of resources @xcite .",
    "the relation between langevin equation with multiplicative lvy stable noise and fractional fokker - planck equation has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where langevin equation is interpreted in it sense @xcite .",
    "the relation between these two equation are not known in stratonovich interpretation .",
    "fractional fokker - planck equation models have been applied to model enzyme diffusion on polymer chain @xcite and some cases of anomalous diffusion @xcite . however ,",
    "application of lvy stable noise driven sdes can be problematic .",
    "we can always write fokker - planck equation corresponding to langevin equation driven by gaussian noise and vice versa , but such statement is not always true for langevin equation with lvy stable noise .",
    "for example , particle ( enzyme ) dispersion on rapidly folding random heteropolymer can be described by space fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite , but for such equation counterpart langevin equation has not been found @xcite and might not even exits @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristics of the signal is the power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "signals having the psd at low frequencies @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 close to @xmath9 are commonly referred to as `` @xmath0 noise '' , `` @xmath0 fluctuations '' , or `` flicker noise '' .",
    "power - law distributions of spectra of signals with @xmath10 , as well as scaling behavior are ubiquitous in physics and in many other fields @xcite . despite the numerous models and theories proposed since its discovery more than 80 years ago @xcite , the subject of @xmath0 noise remains still open for new discoveries .",
    "most models and theories of @xmath0 noise are not universal because of the assumptions specific to the problem under consideration . a short categorization of the theories and models of @xmath0 noise is presented in the introduction of the paper @xcite , see also recent review by balandin @xcite .",
    "mostly @xmath0 noise is considered as gaussian process @xcite , but sometimes the signal exhibiting @xmath0 fluctuations are non - gaussian @xcite .    often @xmath0 noise is modeled as the superposition of lorentzian spectra with a wide range distribution of relaxation times @xcite .",
    "an influential class of the models of @xmath0 noise involves self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "one more way of obtaining @xmath0 noise from a signal consisting of pulses has been presented in @xcite : it has been shown that the intrinsic origin of @xmath0 noise may be a brownian motion of the interevent time of the signal pulses .",
    "the nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath0 noise were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also papers @xcite ) , starting from the point process model of @xmath0 noise .",
    "a special case of this sde has been obtained using kirman s agent model @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear sdes were used to describe signals in socio - economical systems @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize nonlinear sdes driven by gaussian noise and generating signals with @xmath0 psd by replacing the gaussian noise with a more general lvy stable noise .",
    "the previously proposed sdes then arise as a special case when @xmath1 .",
    "we can expect that this generalization may be useful for describing @xmath0 fluctuations in the systems subjected to lvy stable noise .",

    "the power law dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath142 on the stochastic variable @xmath21 can be traced to the existence of the energy flux due to temperature gradient in a bath .",
    "long jumps leading to lvy stable noise can arise from a complex scale free structure of the bath as is in the case of enzyme diffusion on a polymer @xcite .",
    "there are suggestions that the non - homogeneity of the bath can be described by the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the particle coordinate @xmath21 @xcite and lvy stable noise arises from the bath not being in an equilibrium .    in the case of gaussian noise ( @xmath1 ) nonlinear sde ( [ eq : sde - power-1 ] ) that generates signal with @xmath0 spectrum",
    "can be obtained from various models .",
    "one of those models is a signal consisting form a sequence of pulses with a brownian motion of the inter - pulse durations @xcite .",
    "this suggests that our more general form of the sde could be obtained from some kind of lvy motion of the inter - pulse durations .",
    "however , we were unable to show this due to the complexity of it formula in case of equations driven by lvy process @xcite .",
    "the special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sde - power-1 ] ) for free particle ( @xmath143 ) with lvy stable noise having @xmath4 has been derived from coupled continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) models @xcite , when jumping rate @xmath144 of ctrw process depends on signal intensity as @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "however , such derivation is quite complex and does little to help the understanding what kind of physical phenomena can be approximated by multiplicative lvy stable noise .",
    "thus instead of searching for underlying models in this article we have chosen an simpler approach : we have derived nonlinear sdes using a simple reasoning about scaling properties of the steady state pdf .    taking into account of the scaling properties of the signal is one of the advantages of our model . in many theoretical models , such as diffusion of the particle in a fractal turbulence @xcite , ecological population density with fluctuating volume of resources @xcite , dynamics of two competing species @xcite and tumor growth @xcite , an existence of lvy stable noise instead of gaussian noise",
    "is simply assumed .",
    "such assumption might be incorrect , because the change of statistical properties of the noise change the scaling properties of the signal . in order to preserve original scaling properties of the signal the drift @xmath12 or diffusion @xmath142 coefficients",
    "must be changed as well .",
    "the required drift coefficient @xmath12 can be found similarly as in section  [ sec : power ] .",
    "the scaling properties can be extracted from time series using fluctuation analysis methods @xcite .    in summary , we have proposed nonlinear sdes with lvy stable noise and generating signals exhibiting @xmath0 noise in any desirably wide range of frequency . proposed sdes ( [ eq : sde - power-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : sde-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sde-3a ] )",
    "are a generalization of nonlinear sdes driven by gaussian noise and generating signals with @xmath0 psd .",
    "the generalized equations can be obtained by replacing the gaussian noise with the lvy stable noise and changing the drift term to preserve statistical properties of the generated signal .",
    "we have investigated two cases : in the first case the stochastic variable can acquire only positive values ( sde ( [ eq : sde - power-1 ] ) ) , in the second case the stochastic variable can also be negative ( sdes ( [ eq : sde-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sde-3a ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the sdes with the gaussian noise , the constant in the drift term , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - pos ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma - pos - neg ] ) , is different in those two cases and becomes the same only for @xmath1 .",
