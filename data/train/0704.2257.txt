    "the hallmark of the bcs model of superconductivity in metals is the presence of an excitation gap @xmath0 .",
    "this gap is caused by the formation of cooper pairs describing correlated electron pairs in time - reversed states .",
    "thus , pairing correlations in superconductors tend to minimize the total spin of the electron system .",
    "ferromagnetic correlations , on the other hand , prefer to maximize the total spin and form a macroscopic magnetic moment .",
    "early work  @xcite predicted a state in which both pairing and ferromagnetic order are present , if ferromagnetism is caused by localized paramagnetic impurities .",
    "the experimental observation that both states of matter can coexist in heavy fermion systems  @xcite and high - tc superconductors  @xcite came as a surprise and led to the search for new theoretical models to describe this coexistence .",
    "a bcs - like model of @xmath1-wave pairing combined with a simple stoner - like model of ferromagnetism was used to derive such an intermediate state within a mean - field approximation .",
    "@xcite however , it was argued that such a state is unstable in the bulk .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it was shown that a proper hartree - fock mean - field theory of the model does not support coexistence of @xmath1-wave superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite    a similar model of bcs - like pairing and exchange interaction was shown to be valid in small metallic grains in the mesoscopic regime for a thouless energy @xmath2 that is large compared with the single - particle mean - level spacing @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in such a finite - size system , a partially paired state with finite spin polarization exists within a narrow parameter regime .",
    "@xcite since this coexistence regime is relatively small , it would be difficult to observe it experimentally .",
    "it has been suggested that the probability of spin polarization in the presence of pairing correlation may be enhanced by mesoscopic fluctuations  @xcite or by an asymmetric spin - dependent bandwidth of the single - particle spectrum .",
    "@xcite    here we study the competition between ferromagnetic and pairing correlations in metallic grains in the crossover regime from a few - electron system ( @xmath4 ) to the bulk ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we use richardson s solution of the bcs - like interaction  @xcite and the known solution of the exchange model  @xcite to determine the ground state of the grain . for sufficiently small grains ,",
    "there is a regime in pairing gap @xmath6 and exchange coupling @xmath7 , in which the ground state is partly paired and partly polarized .",
    "we show that , in the presence of a zeeman field , the exchange coupling at which the crossover from a pure superconducting state to the coexistence regime takes place decreases to values that can be realized in several metals .",
    "the onset of magnetization with increasing exchange coupling at a given pairing gap corresponds to a spin jump @xmath8 , followed by successive spin increments of @xmath9 .",
    "the magnitude of the initial spin jump depends on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "similar spin jumps were found in the crossover from a superconducting state to a paramagnetic state ,  @xcite where they are reminiscent of a first - order transition in the bulk .",
    "we apply a mean - field theory similar to the one used in ref .   and compare with the exact results .",
    "in contrast to the exact solution , we find that the mean - field approximation can not describe pairing correlations in the intermediate regime of partial spin polarization .",
    "an isolated metallic grain in which the single - particle dynamics are chaotic and whose dimensionless thouless conductance @xmath10 is large ( @xmath11 ) , can be described by an effective universal hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the creation operator for an electron in the single - particle level @xmath14 with either spin up ( @xmath15 ) or spin down ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "( [ origh ] ) is a pairing interaction with strength @xmath17 and where @xmath18 is the pair creation operator .",
    "the third term in ( [ origh ] ) is an exchange interaction expressed in terms of the total spin operator @xmath19 ( @xmath20 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the exchange coupling constant ( estimated values of @xmath21 for a variety of materials were tabulated in ref .  ) .",
    "the inclusion of such an exchange interaction in quantum dots  @xcite explained quantitatively the measured peak height and peak spacing statistics .",
    "@xcite the last term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ origh ] ) describes the coupling of an external zeeman field @xmath22 ( applied in the @xmath23 direction ) to the spin of the dot . here",

    "orbital diamagnetism can be neglected for small grains .",
    "@xcite the charging energy @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the capacitance of the grain ) is a constant for a grain with a fixed number of electrons @xmath28 and was omitted in the hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) .    in this work , we do not consider mesoscopic effects that originate in the random matrix description of the single - particle hamiltonian . to construct a typical phase diagram of a single grain",
    ", we consider a generic equidistant spectrum @xmath29 with @xmath30 at half filling .",
    "thus we have @xmath31 for an even number of electrons ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 for an odd number ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "orbitals do not contribute to the total spin , so the total spin of the grain is obtained by coupling the singly occupied levels with spin @xmath40 to total spin @xmath41 and spin projection @xmath42 . for a specific set @xmath43 of @xmath44",
    "singly occupied levels , the total spin ranges from @xmath45 to @xmath46 with each spin value having a degeneracy of @xmath47 .",
    "a complete set of eigenstates is then given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are quantum number distinguishing between eigenstates with the same spin .",
    "@xcite    the pairing interaction can only scatter time - reversed pairs from doubly occupied to empty orbitals but does not affect the singly occupied levels ( referred to as `` blocked '' levels ) .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to diagonalize the reduced bcs hamiltonian @xmath50 using the single - particle subspace @xmath51 of empty and doubly occupied levels .",
    "this problem was solved by richardson .",
    "@xcite the eigenenergies are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 are parameters that characterize the eigenstate and @xmath54 is the number of pairs .",
    "s parameters @xmath53 are found by solving the set of @xmath55 coupled non - linear equations @xmath56 to each set of @xmath55 doubly occupied levels at @xmath35 , there is a unique solution for richardson s parameters at @xmath57 .",
    "we note that in the general case richardson s equations depend on the seniority quantum numbers of the levels ( the seniority is the number of electrons not coupled to spin zero ) . in our case , the levels are doubly degenerate and the seniority of a doubly occupied level is zero .",
    "the eigenstates constructed from the subset @xmath51 of empty and doubly occupied levels have spin zero , so the total spin of the grain is determined by the spin-1/2 coupling of the singly occupied levels in @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) are then given by @xmath59 with energies of @xmath60    in this work , we focus on the ground state of the grain as a function of the interaction couplings @xmath17 and @xmath21 . to that end",
    ", we find the lowest energy @xmath61 in ( [ eexact ] ) for a given spin @xmath41 and then minimize with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "the energy @xmath61 is found by choosing a set @xmath58 of @xmath62 singly occupied levels that are placed closest to the fermi energy .",
    "we then populate these @xmath44 levels with spin - down electrons , resulting in a good - spin state with spin @xmath41 and spin projection @xmath63 . for a given set @xmath58",
    ", we solved richardson s equations using the method of ref .  .",
    "the physical parameter desc ribing the pairing hamiltonian is @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is the bulk pairing gap and @xmath3 the single - particle mean - level spacing .",
    "the low - energy spectrum of the grain ( for @xmath64 ) is determined by the value of this parameter .",
    "we can truncate the total number of levels from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , and renormalize @xmath17 such that the low - energy spectrum of the grain remains approximately the same .",
    "for a picketfence spectrum , the renormalized coupling constant is given by @xmath67 strictly speaking , this holds in the absence of an exchange interaction .",
    "however , since the exchange interaction affects only the blocked levels , we expect the renormalization ( [ renorm ] ) to hold as long as the number of blocked levels is small compared with the total number of levels in the band .",
    "the quality of this approximation depends on the choice for @xmath68 and was discussed in detail in ref .  .",

    ", we used the same approximations as in ref .   and neglected a term in the energy @xmath81 which is proportional to @xmath82 . the result ( [ evar ] )",
    "is in agreement with the leading term of an expansion in the inverse number of electrons @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite . comparing ( [ evar ] ) and ( [ eexact ] ) with @xmath63",
    ", we see that the exchange and zeeman terms are treated exactly in this mean - field approximation .",
    "the ground - state spin in the mean - field approximation is found by minimizing @xmath81 in ( [ evar ] ) with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "the ground - state spin of the grain is determined by the competition between various terms in the universal hamiltonian .",
    "the one - body part ( kinetic plus confining one - body potential ) and pairing interaction favor minimal spin @xmath45 while exchange interaction and zeeman field favor a maximally polarized state .",
    "we have studied the ground - state spin as a function of the three parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 . using the exact solution",
    ", we find three different phases : a superconducting phase where the number of pairs is maximal and @xmath45 , a ferromagnetic phase where the system is fully polarized @xmath86 ( all electrons are with spin down ) , and an intermediate regime .",
    "the intermediate regime describes a partially polarized state @xmath87 , in which @xmath62 electrons reside in singly occupied levels closest to the fermi energy and the remaining electrons are paired to give spin zero .",
    "= 0.95    the phase diagram in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane of a grain with even number of electrons and in the absence of zeeman field ( @xmath88 ) is presented in fig .",
    "for weak pairing , the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases are separated by an intermediate regime .",
    "the boundaries of this intermediate regime are described by two critical values @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the exchange interaction that are function of @xmath6 .",
    "the critical value @xmath91 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath6 , i.e. , a stronger exchange interaction is required to polarize a grain with stronger pairing correlations .",
    "however , @xmath92 is almost insensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "the intermediate regime shrinks at larger @xmath6 and eventually disappears above @xmath93 . for stronger pairing correlations ,",
    "the superconducting phase makes a direct transition to the ferromagnetic phase . in this regime (",
    "not shown in fig .  1 )",
    ", the phase boundary exhibits a strong dependence on the bandwidth @xmath65 .    for comparison ,",
    "we show the mean - field results in fig .",
    "we observe that the mean - field results are qualitatively different from the exact solution .",
    "the region to the right of the thick solid line and dashed line describes an superconducting phase with @xmath94 . however , there is no superconducting solution ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) for @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , in each of the partially polarized regions with spin @xmath97 , the corresponding pairing gap vanishes @xmath98 and there are no pairing correlations present . while solutions with @xmath99 exist , they occur for values of @xmath6 for which a higher spin state with no pairing correlations has lower energy ( because of the exchange interaction ) .",
    "for example , a solution with @xmath100 exists only for @xmath101  @xcite however , at this strength of pairing correlation we observe a direct transition from @xmath102 to @xmath103 with @xmath98 as the energy of the lowest @xmath103 state with no pairing correlations is lower than the paired @xmath104 state . as a result ,",
    "the boundaries which separate different spin phases are flat , e.g. , independent of the pairing strength .",
    "in fact , in the mean - field approximation the ground - state wave function is a slater determinant through the whole intermediate regime of partial spin polarization .",
    "thus no coexistence of pairing and spin polarization is observed within the mean - field approach .",
    "in contrast , the exact solution shows that pairing correlations are present as long as the system is not fully polarized .",
    "this can be seen in the shift of the spin transition lines to higher values of the exchange interaction strength as the pairing gap @xmath6 is increased .",
    "thus , the exact solution predicts a regime in which pairing correlations and spin polarization coexist . in the following ,",
    "we only discuss results obtained from the exact solution .",
    "more detailed phase diagrams for @xmath88 are shown in the top row of fig .  2 for both grains with even [ panel ( a ) ] and odd [ panel ( b ) ] number of electrons .",
    "for weak pairing we observe an odd - even effect ( in number of electrons ) .",
    "in particular , the critical value @xmath89 is larger for the odd grain , even though the presence of a blocked level in the odd superconducting phase weakens pairing correlations in the odd grain .",
    "this is because increasing the spin from @xmath40 to @xmath105 in the odd grain costs more one - body energy than increasing the spin from @xmath106 to @xmath107 in the even grain .",
    "the phase boundaries for a finite zeeman field @xmath108 are shown in the bottom row of fig .  2 .",
    "the effect of a zeeman field is twofold .",
    "first , it helps polarizing the grain , making the value of @xmath89 for a given pairing gap smaller .",
    "second , at given exchange strength @xmath7 , it increases the critical value of @xmath6 at which partial spin polarization is destroyed .",
    "both effects together increase the size of the intermediate regime in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane .",
    "[ fig2 ] = 1.0",
    "as we increase the exchange coupling constant @xmath7 at fixed @xmath6 and zeeman field , the spin increases by discrete steps from its minimal value @xmath45 to its maximal value of @xmath86 . in the absence of pairing ( @xmath109 ) , the transition from spin @xmath41 to spin @xmath110 occurs for an exchange coupling of @xmath111    [ fig3 ] = 1.0    the corresponding @xmath109 phase diagrams in the @xmath112@xmath6 plane are shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) for even and odd grains , respectively .",
    "in particular , the phase boundaries are given by @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the ground - state spin increases as a function of @xmath21 in steps of @xmath9 .",
    "an interesting qualitative change in the presence of pairing correlations is the possibility of a spin jump @xmath115 . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the ground - state spin still increases in steps of @xmath9 versus @xmath21 .",
    "however , for @xmath117 , the ground - state spin jumps from @xmath106 to @xmath118 within the range @xmath119 . the size of the first - step spin jump gets larger with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "all subsequent steps are of size one [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] .",
    "a similar effect was observed when superconductivity breaks down due to the presence of a large external zeeman field .",
    "@xcite the experimental findings were qualitatively explained using the mean - field theory we discussed previously ( but without the inclusion of an exchange interaction ) . it was concluded in ref .",
    "that the first - order phase transition from a superconductor to a paramagnet , observed in thin films , is `` softened '' in metallic grains .",
    "here we have shown that spin jumps also occur in the presence of exchange correlations . in the absence to an external zeeman field , these spin jumps are predicted to occur at exchange coupling values @xmath120 .",
    "such exchange coupling values are significantly larger than the values for most metals ( see fig .  9 in ref .  ) .",
    "moreover , the exchange is an intrinsic material property and is difficult to tune experimentally .",
    "the regime of spin jumps can be tuned to lower and more typical values of @xmath21 by applying an external zeeman field .",
    "we have already seen in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) that a relatively weak zeeman field increases the size of the intermediate regime .",
    "it also means that spin jumps can be observed at smaller values of the exchange strength that are accessible to experiments .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) where phase diagrams in the @xmath112@xmath6 plane are shown for a given pairing gap of @xmath121 .",
    "for example , a zeeman field of @xmath122 is sufficient to lower the critical exchange strength for the @xmath123 spin jump to @xmath124 at @xmath121 [ see fig .",
    "3(c ) ] as compared to @xmath125 at @xmath126 without zeeman field [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] .",
    "the idea of a zeeman - field tuning of the values of exchange coupling where spin jumps occur is best illustrated in fig .  4 , where spin staircase functions are shown versus @xmath7 .",
    "in the presence of pairing correlations and the absence of zeeman field , the ground - state spin staircase is shifted to the right and compressed as @xmath6 increases [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , reflecting the fact that the intermediate region shrinks [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] .",
    "for an even grain with @xmath127 , a spin jump of @xmath128 sets in at @xmath129 , while for @xmath130 , a spin jump of @xmath131 occurs at @xmath132 . for a finite zeeman field of @xmath133 , the spin staircase functions that exhibit similar spin jumps are shifted to smaller values of the exchange strength but larger values of the pairing gap [ see fig .",
    "spin jumps of @xmath128 ( @xmath131 ) occur at @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) .    in the relevant experimental situation of a fixed exchange interaction strength ,",

    "the ratio @xmath6 ( for the given metal ) can be made larger by studying a larger grain , hence reducing the mean level spacing @xmath3 .    as an example , niobium has an exchange interaction strength of @xmath138 ( see , e.g. , fig . 9 in ref .  ) . without an external zeeman field",
    ", the ground - state spin will be minimal ( @xmath45 ) at all values of @xmath6 [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] .",

    "2(c ) ] . for these two values of @xmath6 , we can roughly estimate the corresponding critical size of the metallic grain given the bulk gap value @xmath143 and fermi momentum @xmath144 of niobium . in a fermi gas model , the mean - level spacing is related to the volume of the grain by @xmath145 .",
    "assuming a hemispheric grain with radius @xmath146 , we have the relation @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) with an equidistant spectrum predicts a @xmath148 spin transition for a niobium grain of radius @xmath149 and zeeman field of @xmath150 , and a @xmath123 spin jump at @xmath151 and a zeeman field of @xmath152 .",

    "this coexistence regime becomes larger ( in the @xmath7@xmath6 plane ) and therefore more accessible to experiments in the presence of a finite zeeman field .",
    "in particular , we propose that for a given exchange constant ( determined by the material used ) , spin jumps can be observed by tuning a zeeman field .",
    "we have also shown that a quantitative study of the intermediate regime requires the use of the exact solution .",

    "<S> we investigate the competition between pairing correlations and ferromagnetism in small metallic grains in the presence of a zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the universal hamiltonian , valid in the limit of large thouless conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coexistence regime of superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations can be made experimentally accessible by tuning an external zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the exact solution of the model with a mean - field theory and find that the latter can not describe pairing correlations in the intermediate regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the occurrence of spin jumps across the phase boundary separating the superconducting and coexistence regimes .    </S>"
