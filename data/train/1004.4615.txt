    "jet quenching has been discovered in heavy - ion collisions at bnl s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . in this context",
    ", very exciting jet - associated particle correlations @xcite have been observed , which indicates the formation of shock waves in the form of mach cones @xcite , induced by supersonic partons moving through the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "measuring the mach cone angle could give us the possibility to extract the equation of state of the qgp .",
    "shock waves can only develop in a medium which behaves like a fluid .",
    "the large elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 measured at rhic @xcite implies that the qgp created could be a nearly perfect fluid with a small viscosity .",
    "calculations of viscous hydrodynamics @xcite and microscopic transport theory @xcite have estimated the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xmath0 to be less than 0.4 .",
    "there is still an open question if this upper limit of the @xmath0 ratio is small enough to allow the formation of mach shocks .    in this work",
    "we address the question , whether and when relativistic shock waves and mach cones can develop in viscous gluon matter for given @xmath0 values . for this purpose",
    "we consider first the relativistic riemann problem @xcite , which we solve within the kinetic theory and the israel - stewart ( is ) theory of viscous hydrodynamics for comparisons . here",
    "we employ the microscopic parton cascade bamps ( boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ) @xcite and a solver of the is equations , vshasta ( viscous sharp and smooth transport algorithm ) @xcite .",
    "particularly , we demonstrate agreements between the two approaches for matter with ( extreme ) small @xmath0 values and also show deviations when the @xmath0 ratio becomes large , which implies the invalidity of the is theory .",
    "second , we consider a traverse of a high - energy gluon through gluon matter and investigate the formation of shocks in form of mach cones .",
    "preliminary results are obtained by using bamps .",
    "bamps is a microscopic transport model solving the boltzmann equation @xmath4 for on - shell particles with the collision integral @xmath5 .",
    "the algorithm for collisions is based on the stochastic interpretation of the transition rate @xcite . in this study",
    ", we consider only binary gluon scattering processes with an isotropic cross section , which is adjusted locally at each time step to keep a constant @xmath0 value @xcite .",
    "simulations of particle evolution in space and time are performed in a static box , where the whole box is divided into spatial cells with a volume @xmath6 .",
    "collisions of particles in same cells are simulated by monte carlo technique according to the individual collision probability within a time step of @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total cross section , @xmath10 denotes the relative velocity of the two incoming particles with four momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the testparticle number .",
    "the testparticle method is introduced to reduce statistical fluctuations and is implemented such that the mean free path is left invariant .",
    "the relationship between the shear viscosity @xmath13 and the total cross section @xmath9 is given by @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the transport collision rate in case of isotropic scattering processes .",
    "@xmath16 stands for ensemble average in local rest frame .",
