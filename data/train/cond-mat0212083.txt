    "the mechanism of the high-@xmath2 superconductivity ( htsc ) in the cuprates @xcite remains elusive , in spite of extensive experimental and theoretical efforts .",
    "the majority view on the mechanism is to consider magnetic interactions as the main driving force @xcite .",
    "however , the htsc recently observed in mgb@xmath3 @xcite , graphite - sulfur composites @xcite , and the n - type infinite layer cuprate sr@xmath4la@xmath5cuo@xmath3 @xcite can not be explained by magnetic mechanisms , since these compounds have little spin fluctuations in strong contrast to the cuprate superconductors .",
    "there is no reason to reject , then , the possibility that the htsc in the cuprates also shares a similar non - magnetic mechanism . in this paper",
    "we discuss a phonon mechanism of htsc based upon the overscreening of the inter - site coulomb interaction , in light of recent experimental results on the cuprates . in this mechanism , unlike the bcs theory , the relevant phonons are not the long wave acoustic phonons but the zone - edge optical phonons that induce inter - site charge transfer .",
    "the htsc cuprates are doped mott insulators . even though the antiferromagnetism disappears with only about 2 % of hole doping ,",
    "strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are observed by neutron scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance , and other methods .",
    "for this reason spin fluctuations have been considered to be the principal mechanism of the htsc @xcite .",
    "however , the intensity of spin fluctuations does not correlate , or even anticorrelate , with @xmath2 as the hole concentration is changed .",
    "for instance the spin fluctuations measured by the nuclear relaxation of @xmath6 in tl@xmath3ba@xmath3cuo@xmath7 are the same for the sample with @xmath2 = 85 k and the overdoped sample with @xmath2 = 0 @xcite . even when the composition is the same , the spin fluctuations of la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath10 films prepared by epitaxial growth that have @xmath11 of 47 k were found to be smaller than those of the bulk with @xmath2 of 30 k @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a phonon mechanism based upon the anomalous screening of the inter - site coulomb interaction in a highly correlated electron system leading to strong pairing .",
    "this mechanism does not compete against the magnetic mechanism , and could achieve htsc alone or with a magnetic mechanism through synergetic effect .",
    "there is a large volume of literature that show coupling of superconductivity to the lattice and phonon @xcite .",
    "in particular the in - plane @xmath12 bond - stretching lo phonon mode was observed by neutron inelastic scattering to show strong softening with doping near the zone boundary along the cu - o bond direction @xcite .",
    "this mode induces charge transfer between cu and o , and thus couples strongly to the charge @xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering measurements on yba@xmath3cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( ybco ) suggest that the frequencies of the lo phonons are strongly softened with doping near the zone - boundary , while the to phonons are not @xcite .",
    "we propose that this occurs due to the phonon - induced charge transfer that results in formation of a vibronic state @xcite and a negative electronic dielectric function as will be discussed in section ii .",
    "doped holes in the cuprate superconductors are highly correlated due to the on - site coulomb interaction on cu ions and resultant spin fluctuations .",
    "holes are strongly renormalized due to these interactions , and as a result many physical properties of the cuprate oxides in the normal state show anomalous behavior .",
    "for example , very unusual temperature dependence has been observed for the hall @xcite and seebeck coefficients @xcite and the pseude - gap excitations @xcite have been observed above @xmath2 .",
    "the quasi - particle band structure determined by angular resolved photoemission is very different from those calculated with the lda due to the correlation effect @xcite .    because of these strong correlation effects at present it is very difficult to calculate the electronic response function accurately from the first - principles . instead ,",
    "in the present paper we take a phenomenological approach based upon the information obtained from the experimental data .",
    "we start with the model electronic band structure that agrees with the angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite , and estimate the effective interaction using the phonon dispersion determined by the inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the superconducting order parameter and the superconducting transition temperature on the basis of eliashberg s formulation @xcite .",
    "we show that the order parameter is of the @xmath1-wave symmetry @xcite and the superconducting transition temperature can exceed 200k . because of the @xmath15-symmetry the present phonon - mediated pairing mechanism does not compete against the spin - fluctuation mechanism .",
    "it is possible that both mechanisms operate in the cuprate , and the weight depends upon the doping level .",
    "the issue of the in - plane anisotropy in the phonon dispersion @xcite and the effect of the possible local spin / charge stripe fluctuation will not be included in this paper , and will be discussed in future publications .    in section",
    "ii we explain the idea of overscreening in the cuprate superconductors . in section",
    "iii we derive the equation with the charge kernel for the calculation of the order parameter and @xmath2 . in section",
    "iv we determine the energy band renormalized by the correlation effect by utilizing the experimental results of the angle - resolved photoemission and the dielectric function using the results of the neutron scattering measurements . in section",
    "v we determine the kernel of the equation by using the model obtained in section iv .",
    "we then numerically solve the equation and obtain the superconducting order parameter and estimate the value of the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the section vi is devoted to discussions .",
    "the starting point of this research is to recognize that the electron - phonon ( @xmath16 ) interaction in such a strongly correlated electron system can be very different from that in the conventional metals . in particular , since the carrier density in the cuprate superconductors is relatively low and the charge dynamics is strongly correlated with the spin dynamics , the medium - range coulomb interaction is not fully screened .",
    "for instance the optical reflectivity does not saturate as in the standard drude model even below the nominal plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "thus the system has strong dielectric interactions , unlike in the usual metals .",
    "in particular , since phonons modulate the covalent bonds they induce charge transfer between ions , and therefore local polarization . in this paper",
    "we suggest that this effect can be described with a negative electronic dielectric function .",
    "sometime ago tachiki and takahashi proposed an overscreening mechanism of phonon - mediated superconductivity @xcite . to explain this mechanism",
    "let us consider a static case of the overscreening effect .",
    "we write a staggered external electric field as @xmath17 and the induced staggered electric charge polarization as @xmath18 , and define the electronic charge susceptibility @xmath19 by @xmath20then , combining an electromagnetic relation @xmath21 with eq.(1 ) , we have @xmath22according to the kramers - krnig relation , we have @xmath23where @xmath24 is the spectral intensity of the electronic charge fluctuation given by @xmath25\\]]the spectral intensity is always positive and therefore we have an inequality from eqs .",
    "( 2,3,4 ) , @xmath26the inequality eq.(5 ) gives two regions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the former case is commonly seen for most materials , such as metals where @xmath29 diverges positively , while the latter case corresponds to overscreening .",
    "let us consider a positive test charge density @xmath30 .",
    "the test charge induces the screening charge density @xmath31 to reduce the energy of the system .",
    "the screening charge is always negative . using this charge density ,",
    "@xmath32 is expressed as @xmath33when @xmath34 is larger than @xmath30 in eq.(6 ) , @xmath32 is negative .",
    "this is the static overscreening effect .",
    "the microscopic origin of the negative dielectric function may come from the following mechanism .",
    "the electric polarizability in covalent solids is qualitatively different from that in simple ionic crystals , since the covalency contributes to charge transfer between ions @xcite .",
    "for instance in ferroelectric oxides the polarization due to charge transfer is as large as the ionic polarization . in batio@xmath13",
    "the nominal valence of ti is + 4 and the nominal @xmath15 state configuration is @xmath35 .",
    "but the @xmath15-orbital of ti and the @xmath36-orbital of o are strongly hybridized .",
    "this charge transfer produces current , and thus electronic polarization , which adds to the ionic polarization , making the effective valence ( born effective charge ) of ti twice as large @xcite . in undoped",
    "cuprate the same transfer occurs from the filled @xmath36-level of o to the empty upper hubbard band of cu , contributory to an extra polarizability .    however , in a doped cuprate the situation is drastically different .",
    "the doped holes occupy mostly the oxygen @xmath36-levels , and they move either to the lower hubbard band or the filled @xmath37 orbital of cu . thus holes are transferred from o to cu , creating the larger polarization , which adds to two ionic polarization",
    ". then , eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) give a negative dielectric function if @xmath38 .",
    "the more detailed discussions of the lattice softening using born effective charge will be given elsewhere @xcite .    while the in - plane cu - o bond - stretching lo phonon mode in the cuprates is strongly softened by doping , other phonon modes are relatively insensitive to the doping level @xcite .",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the basic lattice dynamics is not affected by doping , and the frequency of the bond - stretching mode is renormalized only by the interaction with charge fluctuations .",
    "this assumption allows to write the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the spectral intensity of the renormalized lo phonon in terms of the electronic dielectric function as @xcite ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the bare to and lo phonon frequencies in the insulating state , and",
    "@xmath42 is the real part of the electronic dielectric function .",
    "the experimental results that the frequency @xmath43 of the lo mode is lower than that of the to mode .",
    "it indicates that the real part of @xmath44 is negative . in yba@xmath3cu@xmath13o@xmath45 ( ybco ) and la@xmath46sr@xmath47cuo@xmath10 ( lsco )",
    "the inversion of the lo / to frequencies is most pronounced in the region @xmath48 = 0.25 to 0.75 and @xmath49 = -0.2 to 0.2 , in the units of @xmath50 , at @xmath51 being the measured lo frequency ( approximately 55 mev for ybco and 70 mev for lsco ) mcq1,egami2,egami3 .",
    "we interpret this phenomenon as the consequence of the negative @xmath52 .",
    "the quasi - particles are renormalized due to the on - site coulomb interaction as mentioned in introduction .",
    "the interaction increases the effective mass of the quasi - particles , but does not change the charge @xmath53 of the particles .",
    "therefore , the effective potential acting between quasi - particles @xmath54 and @xmath55 is written as @xmath56where @xmath57 is the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "therefore with the normal screening the effective potential is always smaller than the bare potential .",
    "however , in the case of overscreening @xmath60 can be negative , and thus @xmath60 contributes to the effective interaction and works to enhance the phonon mediated attractive interaction as seen in section iii . since the overscreening effect comes from various kinds of the correlation effect , @xmath61 is a complicate function of charge , spin , and lattice .",
    "this effect is the core of the present mechanism .",
    "consequently the attractive interaction should exist between the quasi - particles with @xmath54 and @xmath55 when @xmath62 is in the @xmath58 regions where the phonon softening occurs , as seen in eq.(7 ) .",
    "in addition the negative electronic dielectric function turns the repulsive electron - electron coulomb interaction into attraction , as in the so - called negative - u mechanism , and can promote pairing .",
    "in this section we derive the equation to calculate the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and @xmath2 , using the effective interaction eq.(8 ) @xcite . in the effective interaction , the dynamical dielectric function @xmath63",
    "is given by the sum of the electronic dielectric function @xmath64 and the ionic dielectric function @xmath65 as @xmath66a minus unity in the right hand side of eq.(9 ) comes from the fact that all the dielectric functions should be unity at the high frequency limit .",
    "we express the ionic dielectric function on a conventional form , @xmath67@xmath41 and @xmath40 being respectively the frequencies of the bare longitudinal and transverse optical phonons in the insulating state . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider one optical phonon mode , which seems to be most relevant to the superconductivity , and assume that it is dispersionless in the unrenormalized state .",
    "the spectral intensity function of total charge fluctuations is expressed by using eqs.(4),(9 - 10 ) as @xmath68   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{\\pi } im[\\frac{1}{\\epsilon _ { el}({\\bf q},\\omega ) } ] + \\frac{\\omega _ { lo}^{2}({\\bf q})-\\omega _ { to}^{2}}{{\\epsilon _ { el}({\\bf q},\\omega _ { lo}^{\\ast } ) } ^{2}}\\delta ( \\omega ^{2}-\\omega _ { lo}^{\\ast 2}),\\end{aligned}\\]]where the first term in the right hand side of eq.(11 ) is the electronic spectral intensity @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the lo phonon frequency renormalized by charge fluctuations and is given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "if we use the spectral representation for @xmath71 , the effective interaction eq.(8 ) is written as @xmath72,\\]]using eq.(12 ) we set up the eliashberg equation linearized with respect to the gap function @xmath73 as @xmath74where @xmath75 with @xmath76 being integer , and @xmath77 is the quasi - particle energy measured from the fermi level .",
    "we use an approximation that the damping of the quasi - particles is neglected .",
    "however , the modification of the band structure due to the correlation effect is taken into account by using the model band structure determined by the experimental results of angle - resolved photoemmision .",
    "if we introduce the pair function defined by @xmath78eq.(13 ) is rewritten as @xmath79we then introduce again a function @xmath80 @xcite defined by @xmath81and also @xmath82then , from eqs.(14 ) and ( 16 ) we can show that @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 to a good approximation . the equation for @xmath85",
    "is obtained substituting eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) for eq.(15 ) as @xmath86 in eq.(18 ) , the kernel @xmath87 is given by @xmath88.\\]]if we insert eq.(11 ) for @xmath89 in eq.(19 ) and use the kramers - kronig relation for @xmath90 in @xmath91 , the kernel eq.(19 ) is written as @xmath92}].\\]]roughly speaking , in the right hand side of eq.(20 ) the first two terms are the electronic contribution and the third term is the phonon contribution .",
    "however , the electronic contribution is mixed also in the third term as seen in eq.(20 ) .",
    "therefore , the kernel has a vibronic nature .    the spectral intensity @xmath93 is approximately written around @xmath94 being @xmath95 @xcite as @xmath96 ^{2}+\\delta^{2}({\\bf q})}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 in eq.(22 ) , @xmath98 is the imaginary part of the electronic dielectric function . @xmath99",

    "( 22 ) and the neutron scattering experimental value of @xmath102 2mev , we obtain @xmath98 to be 0.0069 .",
    "therefore , we can approximate @xmath103 by @xmath104 , while we can see that the damping on the low frequency charge fluctuation is very weak . in conventional systems with @xmath105 the third term in eq.(20 ) can not be enhanced . however , when @xmath106 and its absolute value is small , the phonon contribution can be strongly enhanced , as seen from eq.(20 ) . the strong softening of @xmath107 also enhances the third term .",
    "in this section , the quasi - particle band structure and the dielectric function are determined by utilizing the experimental data of the angle - resolved photoemission and inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "the results will be used in the following section in calculating the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and the superconducting transition temperature with the eliashberg equation .",
    "we assume that the layers responsible for the high @xmath2 superconductivity are mainly the cuo@xmath3 layers .",
    "then , we construct the energy band of the cuo@xmath108 layer ( the @xmath109 plane ) as to agree with the results of the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . the band structure is almost universal for all the cuprate superconductors with optimum doping @xcite .",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission @xcite and the calculation including the correlation effect @xcite shows the energy band in the cuprate superconductors is very flat in the region of @xmath110 in units of @xmath50 , at @xmath111 mev below the fermi level .",
    "hereafter , we express the wave number in units of @xmath50 . this is the region where the superconducting gap is the largest , and the kink in dispersion , which is interpreted as an evidence of strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite , is most conspicuous .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that the charge fluctuation created by quasiparticles on the flat band is very low in energy , comparable to the optical phonon frequency .",
    "then , the quasi - particles and phonons can be highly mixed , and this system consequently becomes vibronic . as a result the quasiparticle - phonon interaction is highly enhanced , as will be shown in sections iii and v.    the band structure with the flat regions along the @xmath112 and @xmath113 axes which originate from the strong renormalization effect @xcite is reproduced by the following function , @xmath114where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 are respectively @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath119 and @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is @xmath123 and @xmath124 is from 0.01 to 0.03 in units of ev . in this equation , if the second term is dropped , the equation approximately coincides with that of the usual lda band calculation @xcite .",

    "these flat regions mainly originate from the correlation effect reflecting the electron scattering due to spin fluctuations @xcite . in these regions",
    "the effective masses and the damping constants of the quasi - particles are very large . on the other hand , the energy band in the directions from the ( 0 , 0 ) point to the ( 0.5 , 0.5 ) , ( 0.5 , -0.5 ) , ( -0.5 , 0.5 ) , ( -0.5 , -0.5 ) points is not much affected by the correlation effects and the dispersion of the electronic energy band structure is usual as seen in the inset ( b ) of fig . 1 .    = 16.0 cm = 17.0 cm      recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the optimally doped ybco show that the frequencies of the lo and to phonons of @xmath12 bond - stretching lo mode are inverted in the region of @xmath137 to @xmath138 mcq1,egami2,egami3,chung1 , suggesting that @xmath139 in this region is negative according to eq.(7 ) and the lo phonons are overscreened by charge fluctuations .",

    "the existence of such a low energy charge fluctuation due to anomalous electronic structures has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "the existence of the low frequency charge excitation is a necessary condition for the appearance of the negative dielectric function .",

    "these different features for the region i and ii are seen in fig .",
    "= 12.0 cm = 8.0 cm    thus , the electric overscreening effect is found to enhance the phonon contribution strongly and to give a strong attractive interaction .",
    "in fact , the comparison between the first and the third term contribution in the region ii for the quasi - particles on the fermi surface tells us that the third term contribution is 10 times larger than the first term in this case .",
    "this result indicates that the electron - phonon interaction enhanced by the overscreening could be the main pairing interaction in the cuprate superconductors .",

    "we use the following technique .",
    "we introduce an eigenvalue equation with an eigenvalue @xmath172 tachiki1,tachiki2 , @xmath173 we numerically calculate @xmath172 as a function of temperature @xmath174 . the temperature satisfying @xmath175 corresponds to the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 .",

    "the gap amplitude is generally dependent on the number density of the interacting quasi - particles and the strength of attraction .",
    "since the number density of the quasi - particles in the flat region is much larger than other regions , the gap function is expected to grow considerably in the flat region .",
    "a pair of quasi - particles on the opposite sides of the same flat regions along the @xmath179 axis are attracted , while the interaction is repulsive for a pair of quasi - particles belonging to the flat regions that are rotated by @xmath180 relative to each other .",
    "thus , it is found that the gap amplitudes on the different axes should show different signs , resulting in the @xmath15-symmetry .",
    "= 12.0 cm = 8.0 cm    as seen in fig . 6 , we found that the value of @xmath2 is nearly inversely related to the depth of the flat region .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the experimental results of arpes @xcite , that the depth of the flat region increases with increasing doping , and crosses the fermi level in the overdoped range of composition . at the optimum doping",
    ", the flat region shows a minimum depth .",
    "on the other hand , the value of @xmath2 is dependent also on the width @xmath181 of region ii , increasing almost linearly with the width .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath2 exceeds 300k when the value of @xmath181 approaches to 0.4 with fixing @xmath182 to be 13mev , corresponding to the optimum doping .",
    "it is quite encouraging that such a high value of @xmath2 can be achieved with the present model .",
    "in this paper the mechanism of high @xmath2 superconductivity based upon overscreening of phonons @xcite was developed further using the results of two recent experimental observations .",
    "one is the neutron scattering measurements showing that the frequencies of a bond stretching lo phonons in hole - doped superconducting cuprate oxides being strongly softened in the wave number regions around the brillouin zone boundaries along the @xmath112 and @xmath113 and that the frequency of the lo phonon is much lower than that of the to phonons in these regions @xcite . this phenomenon is explained in terms of the overscreening of the ionic polarization associated with the lo phonon by phonon - induced charge transfer that results in the negative electronic dielectric function .",
    "another one is the angle - resolved photoemission measurement indicating that in the optimally hole - doped cuprates the flat energy band appears just below the fermi level around the x ( m ) points in the brillouin zone @xcite . using the pair interaction derived from the neutron scattering results and",
    "the band structure mentioned above , we set up the eliashberg equation tachiki1,tachiki2 . solving the equation",
    ", we observed that the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is of @xmath1 and the transition temperature is in excess of 200k .    the most dominant contribution to the superconducting pairing in the kernel of the eliashberg equation originates from the phonon contribution that is strongly enhanced by the overscreening effect of the coulomb interaction .",
    "up to now , several phonon mechanisms leading to d - wave superconducting gap function due to the anisotropy of the electronic structure have been suggested @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present theory relies upon a mechanism of phonon overscreening resulting in the negative electronic dielectric function and strong enhancement of its attractive contribution . as the most of the phonon mechanisms , the present theory predicts that the isotope effect @xcite appears in the cuprate superconductors with a relatively low t@xmath183 such as lsco , but this effect may not be visible in the cuprates with a high t@xmath183 such as ybco and bi-2212 , as observed by experiments .",
    "this result comes from the fact that as the superconducting transition temperature increases , the pure phonon contribution for the pairing diminishes and the electronic contribution increases instead . this tendency is consistent with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "the softening of the lo phonon near the brillouin zone boundary was observed by neutron scattering even in the superconducting ba@xmath184k@xmath185bio@xmath186 with negligible spin fluctuation @xcite , and non - superconducting la@xmath187sr@xmath188nio@xmath10 @xcite and la@xmath189sr@xmath190mno@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it appears that the overscreening effect is a common nature in hole - doped transition metal oxide systems .",
    "this phenomenon may be explained in terms of the `` negative born effective charge '' , which will be further elaborated later @xcite .",
    "this concept nicely explains the phonon softening observed for the peiels - hubbard hamiltonian in one dimensional cu - o chain model @xcite . in the cuprates",
    "the bare bandwidth , calculated for instance with the lda , is of the order of 1 ev .",
    "band - narrowing is brought about by spins that almost localize charges and create the extended saddle point in the electronic band structure . in the present paper",
    "this effect was considered phenomenologically by using the renormalized band structure .",
    "however , a more satisfactory theory should include the quantum effect of spins more explicitly . using the @xmath191 model hole doping",
    "was found to create in - gap states in the hubbard gap just at the fermi level , with a dominant oxygen @xmath36-character @xcite .",
    "a better model band structure with these features needs to be developed .",
    "a problem here is that we have much less information about the unoccupied states compared to the occupied states , since the photoemission experiments provide information only for the latter , while the inverse - photoemission technique , which should give the information on the former , has much less resolution .",
    "as we mentioned above in the present mechanism lo phonons excite holes from the local oxygen @xmath36-state to the cu @xmath15-state .",
    "the results of inelastic neutron scattering measurements on yba@xmath3cu@xmath13o@xmath45 @xcite suggest the final state of this transition could be the @xmath37 level of cu , since strong mixing of the in - plane cu - o bond - stretching mode and the apical oxygen mode ( 62 mev ) was observed .",
    "this makes the two - band phononic model @xcite relevant in the present context .",
    "in addition there is a possibility of the transition from an oxygen in the @xmath192-direction to another oxygen in the @xmath193-direction contributing to the @xmath16 coupling @xcite . in the present calculation",
    "just one band was assumed for the sake of simplicity , but the reality is likely to be more complex .",
    "another point that has not been included in the present paper , and has to be addressed in future publications , is the question of the in - plane anisotropy and the stripe fluctuations .",
    "both the inelastic neutron scattering measurement of the phonon dispersion and the photoemission measurement detected surprisingly strong anisotropy in the cuo@xmath3 plane egami2,egami3,endoh , shen2 .",
    "this anisotropy most likely is related to the spin - charge phase separation in the form of stripes @xcite .",
    "while static stripes apparently compete against superconductivity @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that the propensity for stripe formation remains strong even in the superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "the presence of stripes or stripe fluctuations will produce further narrowing of the band and spin - charge interference phenomena , which should enhance the superconductivity .",
    "the possibility of such enhancement by confinement , in a more general sense , was emphasized by phillips @xcite . however , since we do not have sufficient information to formulate these phenomena into a rigorous theory , in the present paper we have not explicitly taken them into account .",
    "further experimental as well as theoretical researches are needed to fully account for the spin - charge synergy .    in the present mechanism",
    "the role of spins is merely to bring down the energy scale of holes to the level of phonons , so that the vibronic resonance can take place .",
    "we do not , however , exclude the possibility that the magnetic mechanism also contributes to pairing , at least in some ranges of composition .",
    "even in such a case the phonon mechanism does not compete against the magnetic mechanism because of the @xmath15-symmetry .",
    "it is most likely that the relative importance of the phononic and magnetic mechanisms depends upon charge density ; magnetic mechanism could be more important in the underdoped region , while the phononic mechanism may dominate the optimum and overdoped region .    in the present paper we sacrificed some details as discussed above and",
    "greatly simplified the model .",
    "furthermore it is well known that the calculation of @xmath157 in the eliashberg theory strongly depends upon details of the parameters .",
    "the purpose of this work , therefore , is not to try to describe the superconductivity in the cuprates very accurately , but to demonstrate the possibility of the phononic mechanism of high-@xmath157 superconductivity based upon the overscreening phenomenon .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath2 is even higher than the experimental values over wide ranges of parameters .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that the calculation of tc is essentially based on a mean field theory and does not include the superconducting fluctuation effect .",
    "inclusion of the fluctuations should significantly decrease @xmath2 , since the pairing force is strong and the system has a two dimensional nature .",
    "the incoherent superconducting fluctuations will be observed as the pseudo gap above @xmath157 .    while there are a number of limitations in the present model because of",
    "the simplifications and the phenomenological nature , the result described here strongly suggests that the phononic mechanism has to be taken seriously , and careful studies are warranted .",
    "we will address some of the problems that are neglected here in future publications .",
