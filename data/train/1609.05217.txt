    "developing suitable many - body wavefunctions has provided remarkable insights into the physics of collective phenomena . given the complexity of large quantum systems , this is a rather ardous task that demands the use of an extense theoretical arsenal . in the context of strongly - correlated systems ,",
    "a tool that has yielded several fruitful results in this direction has been conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most notorious application may be in the realm of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) physics .",

    "one of the main predictions from this ansatz is the existence of abelian fractional statistics for the emergent quasiparticles .",
    "this inspired moore and read to develop a general framework to describe more exotic filling fractions @xcite .",
    "in particular , they proposed a pfaffian state with topological degeneracy for @xmath1 .",
    "for this state , the low - energy quasiparticles exhibit non - abelian fractional statistics .",
    "progress has also been made for lattice systems .",
    "inspired by the so - called matrix product states ( mps ) , it has been proposed that variational wavefunctions can be constructed from correlators in a cft @xcite . in this case , ( chiral ) primary operators @xmath2 replace the usual finite - dimensional matrices @xmath3 of the original ansatz .",
    "the most important examples have made use of wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) cfts , where the internal @xmath4 symmetry can be exploited to encode the physical ( spin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this framework has been successfully applied to systems such as the haldane - shastry ( hs ) spin chain in 1d @xcite and the kalmeyer - laughlin ( kl ) model in 2d @xcite .",
    "this mps construction has also inspired sensible numerical truncation schemes for continuous fqh states @xcite .",
    "one may wonder if a cft with no internal symmetries ( as , for instance , the minimal rational conformal field theories ( rcfts ) originally introduced in @xcite ) can be used to generate useful lattice wavefunctions . here",

    "we have introduced a general framework for the construction of many - body wavefunctions for lattice systems starting from the cbs of a rcft . whenever present , internal symmetries can be exploited to describe the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this was illustrated using the @xmath72 wzw model in relation to the hs spin chain @xcite . in the absence of symmetry ,",
    "the different fusion channels of primary fields become the natural resource for the construction of the hilbert space .",
    "we used this idea to obtain a family of variational wavefunctions from the chiral ising cft .",
    "these states inherit some algebraic properties from the cft , such as the well - known kw duality and a representation of the tlj algebra .",
    "we provided numerical evidence that these variational wavefunctions can describe the exact ground states of the itf spin chain for certain values of the external field , most notably the ground state at the critical point .",
    "further work is needed to characterize the physics of the wavefunctions obtained from the ising cbs .",
    "in particular , it is desired to prove analytically that the homogeneous cbs @xmath198 indeed provide the exact ground state of the critical itf spin chain for all system sizes .",
    "a physical interpretation of this result is that the ising degrees of freedom can be seen as the fusion channels of pairs of more elementary @xmath88 fields , the kw duality being just the relation between two different types of pairing along the chain . within this context ,",
    "cbs that contain both @xmath88 and majorana fields are natural candidates for excited states @xcite .    in addition , it is worth studying natural generalizations to other rcfts , such as the potts model @xcite , as well as lattice systems in higher dimensions . in particular , 2d systems can be studied by distributing the coordinates on the complex plane . it is known that the wavefunction obtained from @xmath72 using this configuration produces the kl state @xcite .",

    "assuming that @xmath199 is real up to a phase that does not depend on @xmath94 , we have @xmath200 so that the normalization condition becomes @xmath201 where we used @xmath202 this is really convenient because the macrogroups associated to @xmath203 have the even numbers on one side and the odd numbers on the other .",
    "this implies that @xmath124 is just a product of sines and does not contain square roots , so that @xmath125 does not depend on @xmath126 @xmath204",
    "for @xmath205 , it is easy to check that the exact ground state @xmath206 of is given by @xmath207 using the conformal block wavefunction , we have ( here , @xmath208 ) @xmath209 given that @xmath210 , we compute @xmath211 from the macrogroup @xmath212 , @xmath213 @xmath214 plugging this back into the previous equation , we see that the two wavefunctions are the same .    for @xmath215 , we can also compute the exact solution .",
    "we have @xmath216 we note that all the macrogroups except for @xmath203 are composed of sets of one even number and two odd numbers , or viceversa . and can easily convince onceself then that @xmath217 we can massage the cb wavefunction and write @xmath218 which agrees with the exact ground state ."
