    "there has been considerable recent work on the effects of decay or annihilation of exotic particles on light element abundances  @xcite .",
    "since standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) predictions of light element abundances are more or less consistent with observations , changes of abundances relative to those of the standard bbn can not be large .",
    "this makes it possible to constrain theories beyond the standard model through their consistency with observed light element abundances .",
    "moreover the decay process of massive particles might change the lithium abundances providing a solution to the lithium problems .",
    "recent studies suggest that radiative decay could lead to the production of @xmath3li to the level at most @xmath4 times larger than that observed in metal - poor halo stars ( mphss ) when the decay life is of the order of @xmath5  s  @xcite , and the hadronic decay can be a solution of both the lithium problems although that case gives a somewhat elevated deuterium abundance  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the existence of heavy ( @xmath6  gev ) long - lived color flavored particles has been discussed in scenarios of split supersymmetry  @xcite , and weak scale supersymmetry with a long - lived gluino  @xcite or squark  @xcite as the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles .",
    "those heavy partons would be confined at temperature below the deconfinement temperature @xmath7  mev inside exotic heavy hadrons , i.e. , strongly interacting massive particles ( simps )  @xcite . under the assumption that the @xmath0 particles are in statistical equilibrium with the thermal background in the early universe , kang et al .",
    "@xcite estimated a relic abundance of those hadrons based upon a comparison between their annihilation rate and the hubble expansion rate . in this way",
    "the estimated relic abundance can be written @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number density of the @xmath0 particles , and @xmath10 is the entropy density with @xmath11 the total number of effective massless degrees of freedom  @xcite just below the qcd phase transition .",
    "@xmath12 is the temperature of the expanding universe , @xmath13 is the effective radius for annihilation of the @xmath0 particles ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the temperature at which the @xmath0-particles are formed , and @xmath16 is the mass ( @xmath17  gev ) of the heavy long - lived colored particles .",
    "this relic density corresponds to a number fraction of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density of baryons .",
    "we therefore assume the existence of the long - lived heavy hadronic particle @xmath0 and study effects of such particles on bbn .",
    "experimental constraints on hypothetical simps have been delineated in  @xcite .",
    "the effect of new neutral stable hadrons on bbn was studied in  @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the strong force between a nucleon and a stable hadron is similar to that between a nucleon and a @xmath20 hyperon and that most new hadrons end up in a bound state of @xmath21he plus the hadron after bbn .",
    "the result of their analytical calculation showed that the stable hadrons would be preferentially locked into beryllium .",
    "in other words , beryllium has the largest fraction @xmath22 of bound states with the hadrons among the light elements produced in bbn , where the @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent a nuclide @xmath23 and a bound state of @xmath23 with a hadron @xmath0 .",
    "mohapatra and teplitz  @xcite estimated the cross section for an @xmath0 to be captured by @xmath21he and claimed that the fraction of hadronic @xmath0 particles captured by @xmath21he nuclei is smaller than that assumed in  @xcite .",
    "therefore a large fraction of free @xmath0 particles would not become bound into light nuclides .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a consistent calculation of bbn in the presence of a hypothetical long - lived simp @xmath1 of charge zero assuming that the @xmath1 nucleon interaction is of a similar strength to that between two nucleons .",
    "binding energies of bound states of @xmath0-particles and nuclei , which we call @xmath0-nuclei , are estimated .",
    "rates for @xmath0 capture by nuclides , as well as the nuclear reactions and @xmath25 decay rates of @xmath0-nuclei are also estimated .",
    "we calculate bbn including the @xmath1 particles as a new species taking account of many reactions related to @xmath1 particles in a network calculation , and study the effects of @xmath1 particles on bbn . in sec .",
    "[ sec2s ] assumptions regarding the @xmath0 particle , estimations for binding energies of @xmath0-nuclei and various reaction rates are described . in sec .",
    "[ sec3s ] results of the network calculations are shown , and the constraints on parameters of the @xmath1 are derived from a comparison with observed primordial light element abundances .",
    "conclusions of this work are summarized in sec  [ sec4s ] .",
    "we have added the @xmath0 particles and relevant @xmath0-nuclei @xmath24 as new species .",
    "their reactions have been added to the bbn network code of refs .",
    "nuclear reaction rates for the standard bbn have been replaced with new rates published in ref .",
    "@xcite and the adopted neutron lifetime is @xmath26  s  @xcite .",
    "both proton and neutron captures and other nuclear reactions of @xmath0-nuclei are taken into account .",
    "we have modified most of the thermonuclear reaction rates on the @xmath0-nuclei from the original rates ( without @xmath0-nuclei ) .",
    "binding energies between nuclei and @xmath0 particles are of order @xmath4  mev .",
    "they are larger than those between a nucleus and massive particles which only interact electromagnetically of @xmath27  mev  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath0 particles lead to significant changes in reaction @xmath28-values for reactions involving @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "three possible effects of the binding of the @xmath0 particles are : 1 ) changes in the coulomb barriers resulting from the charge ( if any ) of the @xmath0 particle in the nucleus ; 2 ) modified reduced masses ; and most importantly , 3 ) the modified @xmath28-values .      the @xmath1 particle is assumed to be hadronic and to have zero electric charge and zero spin .",
    "its mass is assumed to be much larger than the nucleon mass .",
    "we note that @xmath29 particles may also be present during bbn . unlike the leptonic @xmath29 case",
    ", they could have a strong interaction with nuclei .",
    "however , there exists coulomb repulsion leading to a certain degree of suppression of their reaction rates .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath29 particles should eventually be included though we neglect them in the present investigation .",
    "also , in this study , the nonthermal nucleosynthesis triggered by the later electromagnetic and/or hadronic decay is not studied .",
    "these effects will be addressed in a future publication . for now , however , as a first step we focus only on the effects of @xmath1 particles on bbn .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0-nuclei is strongly dependent upon their binding energies . in our calculations , binding energies and eigenstate wave functions of @xmath0-nuclei are computed taking into account the nuclear interaction and coulomb interaction between the nucleus and the @xmath0 particle .",
    "we assume that the potential is spherically symmetric .",
    "we then solve the two - body shrdinger equation by a variational calculation ( using the gaussian expansion method  @xcite ) to obtain binding energies .",
    "the two - body shrdinger equation for a spherically - symmetric system is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is planck s constant , @xmath32 is the reduced mass , @xmath33 is the central potential at @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the energy , and @xmath36 is the wave function at @xmath34 . under the assumption that the @xmath0 particle is much heavier than the light nuclides ,",
    "@xmath32 is approximately given by the mass of the nuclide now considered .",
    "the central potential @xmath33 is composed of a nuclear interaction @xmath37 and a coulomb interaction @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 for the coulomb potential , we assume that the charge distributions of the nuclei are gaussian .",
    "we then use the charge radii determined from experiments of the corresponding nuclei ( or neighboring nuclei when experimental data are not available ) . here , we write @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the charges of nuclide @xmath23 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is related to the mean square charge radius @xmath44 as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath0 particle nucleon potential adopted here is assumed to be a square well of radius 2.5 fm and of depth of @xmath47  mev .",
    "this potential reproduces the binding energy of the deuteron i.e. , 2.224  mev .",
    "a woods - saxon potential is adopted for the nuclear potential between other nuclei and the @xmath0-particles , i.e. , @xmath48 where the parameters are taken to be @xmath49  mev , @xmath50  fm and @xmath51 .",
    "the mean square matter radii for nuclei , @xmath52 , are taken from experiments of corresponding or neighboring nuclei . as a special case",
    ", the binding energy of two protons and an @xmath0 particle system , i.e. , @xmath53 , in a @xmath54 orbit , is calculated with the same nuclear potential for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 system as that adopted for the estimation of the binding energy of @xmath57h and an @xmath0 .",
    "the adopted radii and obtained binding energies are listed in table [ tab1s ] .",
    "binding energies in the case of neutral @xmath1 , negatively - charged @xmath58 and positively - charged @xmath29 particles are shown in columns 6 , 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the adopted root mean square ( rms ) nuclear matter radii and their references are listed in columns 2 and 3 .",
    "rms charge radii and their references are shown in columns 4 and 5 .",
    "since the @xmath0 particles are bound strongly to nuclei , their binding energies are typically large ( @xmath4  mev ) , and are even larger for heavier nuclei .",
    "hence , they are bound to nuclei from early in the bbn epoch .",
    "we note that their binding energies would be smaller ( @xmath59  mev ) if they could only bind electromagnetically to nuclei . in that case",
    "they would not be bound to nuclei until low temperature ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the obtained binding energies are used for the estimation of @xmath28-values of various reactions as described below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note some important differences between bbn with strongly interacting @xmath1 particles and bbn with negatively charged leptonic @xmath58 particles that only interact electromagnetically , i.e. no strong interaction .",
    "first , the formation epoch of @xmath0-nuclei in the @xmath1 case begins at @xmath61 which is much earlier than in the @xmath58 case which begins for @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "this derives from the fact that the binding energies of nuclides and @xmath1 particles are of the order of @xmath4  mev which is much larger than the electromagnetic binding of nuclides with @xmath58 particles ( @xmath63  mev ) .",
    "@xmath0-nuclei produced in such a high energy environment have a better chance to be processed so that many species of @xmath0-nuclei are produced in considerable abundance . in the @xmath58 case ,",
    "on the other hand , the temperature of the universe is already so low that when , the @xmath0-nuclei finally form , they can hardly be processed through subsequent nuclear reactions except for the special cases of the resonant @xmath64be@xmath65(@xmath56,@xmath66)@xmath67b@xmath65 reaction  @xcite and the @xmath58-catalyzed transfer reaction @xmath21he@xmath65(@xmath68,@xmath58)@xmath3li  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "nuclides heavier than the beryllium isotopes are not produced in significant amounts in that paradigm .",
    "this result for the time evolution of the @xmath0-nuclei abundances was not predicted precisely in the analytic estimation of previous studies  @xcite .",
    "dicus and teplitz  @xcite deduced that the stable hadrons would be preferentially locked into beryllium .",
    "our result , however , shows that many light elements including beryllium are produced abundantly and beryllium is not particularly more abundant than other nuclides . in the study of  @xcite , the strong photonless reactions ( @xmath68,@xmath69 ) and ( @xmath68,@xmath56 )",
    "were not included .",
    "this is the reason for the large difference between that work and our present results for bbn .    in the present work we have shown that most of the @xmath1 particles end up in @xmath0-nuclei after bbn in contrast to the estimation in  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath0 capture reaction rates adopted in the present study are only approximate and should be calculated more precisely in a more thorough quantum mechanical treatment in the future .",
    "we have shown that strongly interacting @xmath1 particles undergo efficient @xmath0 capture by protons at @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to the subsequent production of @xmath57h@xmath65 , @xmath70he@xmath65 , @xmath21he@xmath65 , and so on .",
    "this does not occur through normal nuclei like @xmath57h , @xmath70he and @xmath21he , but through @xmath0-nuclei from @xmath71h@xmath65 .",
    "this reaction flow was not considered in  @xcite .",
    "although our result includes some uncertainty in the binding energies and nuclear reaction rates of @xmath0-nuclei [ originating from our assumption of the interaction strength ] , we nevertheless expect that the @xmath1 particles will end up in @xmath0-nuclei after bbn as long as the interaction strength is very large compared to electromagnetic strength .",
    "the calculated bbn abundances of light nuclides depend strongly on the @xmath1 abundance , @xmath72 .",
    "as an example , a series of bbn calculations was carried out varying @xmath72 as a parameter with no change in the assumption of large @xmath73 .",
    "although the decay lifetime of @xmath1 is assumed to be much longer than the time scale of bbn  @xmath74  s , the @xmath1 particles are assumed to have been long extinct by now .",
    "the final abundances of stable nuclides are obtained by removing the @xmath1 from the @xmath0-nuclei , @xmath24 , and allowing @xmath23 to decay to a stable nucleus .",
    "the interaction of the decay products with the remaining @xmath23 spectator nucleus , and the nonthermal nucleosynthesis triggered by high energy decay products are neglected here .",
    "such effects , however , should be studied in the future .",
    "figure  [ fig3s ] shows the calculated abundance ratios of @xmath3li / h and @xmath64li / h ( solid curves ) as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the mean values measured in mphss , i.e. , @xmath3li / h=@xmath75  @xcite and @xmath64li / h=@xmath76  @xcite , respectively .",

    ", we find that both cases prefer the production of @xmath3li to that of @xmath64li .",
    "the difference between the two cases is the relative efficiency of @xmath0-catalyzed nucleosynthesis .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath3li production in the @xmath1 case is @xmath77 times larger than in the @xmath58 case when the abundance of the @xmath0 particle ( i.e. @xmath72 ) is taken to be the same .",

    "as described below , constraints on the ( @xmath73 , @xmath72 ) parameter space were derived from observational limits on the primordial light element abundances .",

    "we adopt this value and a 2 sigma uncertainty , i.e. , @xmath80    @xmath70he is measured in galactic hii regions by the 8.665  ghz hyperfine transition of @xmath70he@xmath81  @xcite . a plateau with a relatively large dispersion with respect to metallicity has been found at a level of @xmath70he / h=@xmath82",
    "however , it is not yet understood whether @xmath70he has increased or decreased through the course of stellar and galactic evolution  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it does not seem that the cosmic averaged @xmath70he abundance has decreased from that produced in bbn by more than a factor of @xmath83 due to burning in stars . because both the observations and theoretical predictions of the primordial deuterium abundance are consistent with each other , the deuteron abundance appears not to have decreased since the epoch of bbn .",
    "@xmath70he is more resistant to the stellar burning .",
    "therefore , its abundance would not have decreased significantly .",
    "thus , we adopt a two sigma upper limit from galactic hii region abundances of @xmath84 we do not give a lower limit due to the large uncertainty in the galactic production of @xmath70he .",
    "for the primordial helium abundance we adopt @xmath85 from an analysis  @xcite of the primordial mass fraction based upon new atomic physics computations of the recombination coefficients for hei and of the collisional excitations of the hi balmer lines , together with observations and photoionization models of metal - poor extragalactic hii regions .",
    "we adopt the following range for the primordial @xmath21he abundance within the conservative 2 sigma limits of @xmath86    an upper limit on the @xmath3li abundance is taken which allows for the possible depletion on stellar surfaces of up to a factor of @xmath4 above the observed plateau abundance of @xmath3li / h@xmath87  @xcite .",
    "this upper limit is not larger than the solar abundance of @xmath3li / h@xmath88  @xcite which represents a typical present abundance .",
    "we do not take the lower limit on the observations as a lower limit for the production of @xmath3li by @xmath0-particles , because of the current controversy as to whether the @xmath3li observation is actually a primordial abundance .",

    "the following constraints on the abundance : @xmath140 ( for @xmath120  s @xmath141  s ) , @xmath142 ( for @xmath122  s @xmath143  s ) and @xmath144 ( for 2@xmath126  s @xmath127  s ) have been deduced based upon the observational constraints on primordial light element abundances .",
    "these constraints reject models with long - lived ( @xmath131  s ) colored particles based upon their relic abundance , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "although we made an assumption about the interaction strength of the @xmath1 particle , the magnitude of the effect of long - lived simps on bbn would not change by more than a few orders of magnitude from the result of this study unless the interaction strength is much smaller .",
    "we also expect that the result would not change by many orders even if a simp has a charge of @xmath146 .",
    "this is because the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0-nuclei occurs very early in the universe when the nuclear reactions are not significantly hindered by the coulomb barriers .",
    "more realistic estimates of the reaction rates utilizing a quantum mechanical treatment would be necessary to more precisely study the effect of @xmath1 particles on bbn .",
    "moreover , the direct interactions of decay products with the remaining nuclei @xmath23 in the decay of @xmath1 in an @xmath0-nucleus @xmath24 should be studied in the future in order to better estimate final abundances of the light elements after the @xmath1 decay . nevertheless , the calculated light element abundances in this study should not change by more than an order of magnitude from the effects of the decay of @xmath1 considering the fact that the cross section for the elastic scattering of pions by @xmath147c is roughly one half of the total cross section so that half of the @xmath147c nuclei are left intact even when effects of the hadronic decay are included  @xcite .",
    "we are very grateful to professor masayasu kamimura for helpful discussion and suggestions regarding the nuclear reactions .",
