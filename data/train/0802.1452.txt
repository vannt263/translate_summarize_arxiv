    "one of the greatest discoveries made by the _ hubble space telescope _ is that the formation of star clusters with mass and compactness comparable to those of old globular clusters is still ongoing in violent star forming environments , such as starbursts and galaxy mergers . the young cluster mass function ( cmf : the number of objects per logarithmic cluster mass interval , @xmath0 ) is often reported to be a power - law of spectral index @xmath1 ( i.e. equivalent to @xmath2 ) down to the detection limit  @xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained for the cluster luminosity function  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , old globular cluster systems are found to have a cmf which is gaussian - like with a peak mass of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these very different cmfs between young and old systems present the greatest dissimilarity between the two populations , and perhaps the greatest barrier to identifying young massive clusters as analogues of young globular clusters .    yet",
    ", it is worth keeping in mind that the luminosity / mass distribution of some young star cluster systems does _ not _ obey a power - law .",
    "based on high resolution _ very large array _",
    "observations , @xcite rules out a power - law cluster luminosity function for the young star clusters formed in the starburst galaxy henize 2 - 10 . in ngc  5253 , an irregular dwarf galaxy in the centaurus group ,",
    "@xcite detect a turnover at @xmath4 in the mass function of the young massive star clusters in the central region .",
    "last but not least , the case of the antennae merger of galaxies ngc  4038/39 remains heavily debated . while @xcite infer from their _ hst / wfpc2 _ imaging data a power - law cluster luminosity function with a spectral index @xmath5 , @xcite report the first statistically robust detection of a turnover at @xmath6mag , corresponding to a mass of @xmath7 .",
    "the origin of that discrepancy likely resides in differences in the data reduction and the statistical analysis aimed at rejecting bright - star contamination and disentangling completeness effects from intrinsic cluster luminosity function substructures .",
    "these findings raise the highly interesting prospect that the shape of the cmf at young ages does vary from one galaxy to another .",
    "if it were conclusively proven that the shape of the initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) is _ not _ universal among galaxies but , instead , depends on environmental conditions and/or on the star formation process , consequences would be far reaching since this would imply that the young cmf may help us decipher physical conditions prevailing in external galaxies .    in this contribution",
    ", we report the first results of a project investigating the evolution of the mass function of star forming cores into that of bound gas - free star clusters which have survived expulsion of their residual star forming gas .",
    "a similar study was carried out by @xcite in which they showed that protoglobular cloud mass functions characterized by a mass - scale of @xmath8 evolve into the observed globular cluster mass function .",
    "they propose that the origin of the universal gaussian mass function of old globular clusters thus likely resides in a protoglobular cloud mass - scale common among galaxies and imposed in the protogalactic era .",
    "present - day star forming cores , however , do not show any characteristic mass - scale as their mass function is a power - law down to the detection limit .",
    "previously , kroupa & boily ( 2002 ) showed that a power - law embedded - cluster mass function can evolve into a mass function with a turnover near @xmath9 if the physics of gas removal is taken into account .",
    "taking advantage of the grid of @xmath10-body models recently compiled by @xcite , we explore in greater detail how a featureless core mass function evolves into the icmf as a result of gas removal , which we model as the supernova - driven expansion of a supershell of gas .",
    "we also explore how the icmf responds to model parameter variations so as to understand what may make the mass function of young star clusters vary from one galaxy to another . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we explore this issue from a different angle , that is , by defining an energy criterion , and we apply that alternative model to the mass function of the milky way old globular clusters .",
    "before proceeding any further , it is worth defining the notion of the icmf properly . following the onset of massive star activity at an age of 0.5 to 5myr",
    ", a gas - embedded cluster expels its residual star forming gas . as a result , the potential in which the stars reside changes rapidly causing the cluster to violently relax in an attempt to reach a new equilibrium .",
    "this violent relaxation takes 10  50  myr during which time the cluster loses stars ( `` infant weight - loss '' ) and may be completely destroyed ( `` infant - mortality '' ) ( this process has been studied in detail by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "after @xmath11  myr the evolution of clusters is driven by internal two - body relaxation processes and tidal interactions with the host galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite we define the icmf as the mass function of clusters _ at the end of the violent relaxation phase _",
    ", that is , when their age is @xmath12myr .",
    "the effect of gas expulsion depends strongly on the virial ratio of the cluster _ immediately before _ the gas is removed .",
    "if the stars and gas are in virial equilibrium before gas expulsion the virial ratio @xmath13 of the stars depends entirely on the star formation efficiency ( sfe , or @xmath14 ) such that @xmath15 ( where we define virial equilibrium to be @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "formally , @xmath14 is the _ effective _ sfe ( esfe : see @xcite ; @xcite ) , that is , a measure of how far from virial equilibrium the cluster is at the onset of gas expulsion , rather than the actual efficiency with which the gas has formed stars .",
    "we note that even quite small deviations from virial equilibrium can equate to large differences between the esfe and the sfe .",
    "however , in this paper we will make the assumption that the stars have had sufficient time to come into virial equilibrium with the gas potential ( ie .",
    "gas expulsion occurs after a few crossing times ) , and so the esfe very closely matches the sfe .",
    "we discuss this assumption further in the conclusions .    in this case , the radius of the embedded cluster is the same as that of the core and the three - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stars in the embedded cluster is dictated by the depth of the core gravitational potential , namely : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and radius of the core , respectively , and g is the gravitational constant .    a star - cluster forming ` core ' of mass @xmath20 ( ie .",
    "the region of a molecular cloud that forms a cluster ) with a sfe of @xmath14 will form a cluster of mass @xmath21 .",
    "however , gas expulsion will unbind a fraction @xmath22 of the stars in that cluster such that the mass of the cluster at @xmath23  myr will be @xmath24 ( note that when @xmath25  zero the cluster is destroyed . )",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , for clusters whose age does not exceed , say , 10 - 20myr , the mass fraction of stars that have escaped after gas removal is still small , as most stars do not have a high enough velocity to have become spatially dissociated from the cluster ( see fig .  1 in @xcite and fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the instantaneous mass of these young clusters thus follows : @xmath26 and , in the absence of any explicit dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath20 , the cmf at such a young age mirrors the core mass function .",
    "any meaningful comparison of our model icmfs therefore has to be limited to populations of clusters which have either re - virialised or been destroyed .    in our monte - carlo simulations , we assume that the sfe of a core is independent of its mass .",
    "the core mass function is assumed to follow a power - law of spectral index @xmath1 and we describe the probability distribution function of the sfe as a gaussian of mean @xmath27 and standard deviation @xmath28 , which we denote @xmath29 .    clearly , if the bound fraction of stars after gas expulsion , @xmath30 , depends upon the core mass , then the shape of the icmf will differ from the ( power - law ) core mass function , an effect whose study was pioneered by @xcite .",
    "we now take this point further by combining the detailed @xmath10-body model grid of @xcite , which provides the bound fraction @xmath31 as a function of the sfe @xmath14 and of the ratio between the gas removal time - scale @xmath32 and the protocluster crossing - time @xmath33 .",
    "we model the gas expulsion from an ( embedded ) cluster as an outwardly expanding supershell whose radius @xmath34 varies with time @xmath35 as @xcite : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the energy input rate from type ii supernovae and @xmath38 is the mass density of the residual star forming gas in the core . we assume the mass density profiles of the core and of the newly formed stars to be alike , that is , @xmath39 .    the energy input rate from massive stars expelling the gas is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of supernovae expelling the gas , @xmath42 is the energy of one single supernova , and @xmath43 is the gas removal time - scale . at this stage , however , we know neither @xmath41 nor @xmath43 .",
    "since the energy input rate from massive stars is approximately constant with time over the whole supernova phase , we thus rewrite :    @xmath44    @xmath45 is the supernova phase duration ( i.e. the time from the first to the last supernova ) and @xmath46 is the total number of supernovae formed in the core .",
    "we caution that a fraction only of these contribute to gas expulsion , that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ".    the gas removal time - scale corresponds to the instant when the supershell radius is equal to the core radius @xmath19 , namely , @xmath49 . the combination of that constraint on @xmath32 with eqs .",
    "[ eq : rs ] and [ eq : dote ] gives : @xmath50    while gas - embedded cluster masses vary by many orders of magnitude , their radii are remarkably constant , always of order 1pc ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath51 , it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : taugr ] that , for a given @xmath14 , the gas removal time - scale @xmath43 is independent of the core mass @xmath18 . however , the impact of gas expulsion upon a cluster is not governed by the absolute value of @xmath32 , but by its ratio with the core crossing time @xmath33 , ie .",
    "@xmath31 is a function of @xmath52 .",
    "the dynamical crossing - time of the star forming core is given by @xmath53 which , combined with eq .",
    "[ eq : taugr ] , gives :    @xmath54    in this equation , the number of supernovae , @xmath55 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : taugr ] is expressed as a function of the embedded cluster mass @xmath56 , assuming a kroupa stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the upper stellar mass limit correlates with @xmath57 , as found by @xcite , although the hypothesis of a fixed value for the mass of the most massive supernova progenitor ( say , 60@xmath58 ) hardly affects the results presented in the next section .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the energy released per supernova in units of @xmath61ergs and the duration of the supernova phase , in myr , respectively . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "[ eq : ratio_tau ] shows that , in the absence of a mass - radius relation , the gas removal time - scale , expressed in units of the core crossing time , explicitly depends on the core mass . for a given @xmath14 ,",
    "the deeper potential well of more massive cores slows down gas expulsion when compared to low - mass cores .",
    "massive clusters are therefore better able to adjust to the new gas - depleted potential , and have a larger bound fraction @xmath31 .",
    "[ eq : ratio_tau ] is shown graphically in fig .",

    "we explore how the different icmfs can be produced from the same ( power - law ) core mass function .",
    "the core mass function is modelled as a power - law of spectral index @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath67 ) and the distribution function for the core ( local ) sfe is a gaussian , as defined in section [ sec : icmf ] .",
    "both distributions are sampled independently , that is , the sfe is assumed to be independent of the core mass .",
    "the core radius is set to be @xmath68pc and the ratio @xmath69 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio_tau ] .",
    "the fraction @xmath31 of stars remaining bound to the cluster after gas removal is inferred by linearly interpolating the grid of @xcite ( their table 1 ) which describes how @xmath31 varies with @xmath14 and @xmath69 .    according to our gas removal model",
    ", @xmath43 is the time - scale over which the cluster expels the entirety of its gas .",
    "however , @xcite model gas removal as an exponential decrease with time of the cluster gas content , and their gas removal time - scale ( @xmath70 in their eq .",
    "1 ) corresponds to the time when the residual gas has a fraction @xmath71 of its initial value .",
    "prior to using their results , we multiply @xmath72 by a factor of 3 ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , so that @xmath43 now corresponds to a residual gas mass fraction of @xmath74 , i.e. , the cluster is practically devoid of gas . the corresponding grid is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] . in this paper , we focus on clusters evolving in a low - density environment / weak tidal field and we thus consider the lowest half - mass radius to tidal radius ratio in the grid of @xcite , i.e. @xmath75 . in stronger tidal fields",
    "the shape of the icmf is likely to be more affected than what we find below , since low - mass clusters have smaller tidal radii and are , therefore , more easily disrupted by gas expulsion .",

    "examination of the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] shows that depending on the assumed distribution of sfes @xmath78 , markedly different icmfs are produced , ranging from a power - law shape ( e.g. when @xmath79 , regardless of @xmath80 ) to a bell - shape ( e.g. when @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "these different behaviours stem from how large the variations of the bound fraction @xmath31 with the core mass @xmath18 are . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "let us focus on the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] for which @xmath83 . a sfe as high as @xmath84 guarantees that @xmath31 is only a weak function of the core mass @xmath18 as @xmath85 over the core mass range @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the icmf mirrors that of the core mass function and is close to a power - law of spectral index @xmath1 .    in the case of a sfe of @xmath87 , the same core mass range corresponds to an increase of the bound fraction with the core mass of almost two orders of magnitude ( i.e. @xmath88 ) , making the icmf significantly shallower than the core mass function .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that the detailed form of this icmf is uncertain , as the determination of the bound fraction @xmath89 depends on the fine details of the @xmath10-body modelling of gas expulsion when @xmath90 . as for @xmath91 , @xmath92 when @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] ) .",
    "if the bound fraction were larger over that range of gas removal time - scale to crossing time ratio , the shape of the icmf would be closer to that of the core mass function , while if @xmath31 were zero before increasing at , say , @xmath94 , this would result in a bell - shaped icmf ( see the case of @xmath81 below ) .",
    "the core mass function is most affected when @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] shows that the formation of a bound gas - free star cluster requires its parent core to be more massive than @xmath95 , since the bound fraction is zero otherwise ( note that the top @xmath64-axis is rightward - shifted by @xmath96 in @xmath97 when @xmath98 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio_tau ] ) .",
    "owing to the wide variations of @xmath99 over the core mass range ( @xmath100 ) , the transformation of the core mass function into the icmf is , in this case , heavily core mass dependent : the featureless power - law core mass function evolves into a bell - shaped icmf .",
    "the time - scale for this evolution is that required for the exposed cluster to get back into virial equilibrium following gas expulsion , that is , 50myr .",
    "examination of the model grid computed by @xcite for the sfe and the gas removal time - scale of relevance ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) shows that the end of the violent relaxation phase occurs at about that age and the cluster mass is then as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : minit ] .    as indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] and in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] , the turnover location is determined by the core mass at which the bound fraction is a few per cent .",
    "for instance , a core mass of @xmath103 with @xmath101 leads to @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding initial cluster mass is thus @xmath106 , roughly the mass of the icmf turnover .",
    "that @xmath101 leads to a bell - shaped icmf directly results from the zero bound fraction of stars for core masses less than @xmath8 .",
    "a sfe of @xmath107 would result in the same effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to creating a truncated power - law for the _ cluster _ forming cores , even though the _ star _ forming core mass function is a featureless power - law down to the low - mass regime .",
    "that result is reminiscent of the detailed investigation performed by @xcite who found that a system of cluster parent clouds devoid of low - mass objects , such as a power - law mass function truncated at low - mass , results in a bell - shaped icmf .",
    "we emphasize that , if these clusters were observed at an age of 50myr , their observed mass would closely match the mass predicted by our model .",
    "actually , all clusters of the bell - shaped icmf , irrespective of their mass , stem from gaseous progenitors more massive than @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that unbound stars formed in the core leave the exposed cluster with velocities of order 60km.s@xmath108 and do not linger as part of a halo around the bound part of the cluster . as a related consequence ,",
    "note that if the very early milky way disc went through a violent star formation phase producing such massive clusters , then the corresponding high velocity dispersions lead naturally to the creation of a thick disc component @xcite .    in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] we show the icmf that results from the core mass function for sfe distributions with variance @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "the general features of the panels are the same as for zero variance , however there are increasing differences , especially at the low - mass end of the icmf .",
    "these differences are due to the effect of the sfe not being symmetric around the mean @xmath27 . for @xmath111 , low - mass gas - embedded clusters with @xmath112",
    "are completely destroyed ( @xmath113 ) and this is the case for any cluster selected below the mean . however , a low - mass gas - embedded cluster can be drawn with @xmath114  ",
    "@xmath115 , in which case it will be able to survive and retain a significant fraction of its mass . for this reason ,",
    "the icmf flattens rather than turning - over in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] .    a key assumption underlying the above analysis is the hypothesis of a constant radius for all star forming cores , regardless of their mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : to ] , we examine the effect of the core radius on the form of the icmf produced from a core mass function with @xmath98 ( ie .",
    "a bell - shaped icmf ) .",
    "we explore how the cluster mass at the turnover responds to core radius variations .",
    "a linear scaling for the @xmath116-axis is adopted as it enables us to pinpoint the turnover location more accurately . for the sake of comparison , the icmfs obtained with @xmath117 and @xmath118 and with @xmath66pc ( dotted curves with crosses in top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] , respectively ) are shown as solid lines .",
    "icmfs depicted with open symbols correspond to constant core radius of @xmath119pc and @xmath120pc .",
    "a larger core radius implies smaller core densities , thereby increasing the disruptive effect of gas expulsion and lowering the number of bound gas - free star clusters . that the turnover is at higher cluster mass arises from the leftward - shift of the mass - scaling of the top @xmath64-axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : fbound ] when the core radius is larger ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio_tau ] ) .    as stated in section [ sec : grts ] , observations support the assumption of an almost constant core radius .",
    "this , however , is at variance with theoretical expectations that the mass - radius relation of virialised cores obeys @xmath121  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : to ] .",
    "the normalisation is such that a core of mass @xmath95 has a radius of 1pc .",
    "higher normalisations , corresponding to less dense cores , lead to the disruption of practically the whole original population of embedded clusters . while , for a constant core radius of @xmath66pc , the bell - shape of the icmf is preserved when @xmath123 is increased from 0.00 to 0.03 , the virial mass - radius relation leads to a power - law icmf for @xmath109 . that is , the sensitivity of the icmf shape to the width of the distribution function for the sfe is greater than in case of a constant core radius .",
    "the shape of the mass function of young star clusters remains much debated .",
    "observational results are sorted into two distinct , often opposed , categories : power - law or bell - shaped mass functions .",
    "we have shown in this contribution that both shapes can arise from the same physical process , namely , the supernova - driven gas expulsion from newly formed star clusters on a core mass dependent time - scale . specifically , more massive cores have a higher gas removal time - scale to dynamical crossing - time ratio by virtue of their deeper potential wells ( assuming the near constancy of core radii over the core mass range ) . for a given sfe , this results in larger bound fractions @xmath31 of stars at the end of the violent relaxation which follows gas expulsion .",
    "the shape of the icmf is chiefly governed by the probability distribution of the sfe @xmath14 .",
    "bell - shaped icmfs arise when most star forming cores have @xmath124 . in that case , however , bound gas - free star clusters only form out of cores more massive than @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that bell - shaped icmfs are also associated with gas - rich environments so as to guarantee that the core mass function is sampled to such a high mass .",
    "in contrast , power - law icmfs mirroring the core mass function arise when @xmath125 for most star forming cores .",
    "this implies that the shape of the icmf also depends on the width @xmath80 of the sfe distribution . when @xmath126 , an increasing @xmath123 enhances the contribution of cores with @xmath127 and turns a bell - shaped icmf into a power - law .",
    "the amplitude of that evolution is greater when core radii are assumed to follow the mass - radius relation of virialised cores than when the core radius is assumed to be constant . as illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig : icmf ] and [ fig : to ] , _ that the mass function of young clusters observed in a variety of environments appears not to be universal is not surprising_.    @xcite pointed out that a power - law icmf of spectral index ( -2 ) evolves to a bell - shaped mass function the turnover of which is located at a significantly lower cluster mass than what is observed for the universal globular cluster mass function . for such models , @xcite showed that a power - law icmf with @xmath1 also leads to a radial gradient in the peak of the evolved mass function contrary to what is observed .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that these two issues do not arise if the icmf is depleted in low - mass clusters compared to a power - law of spectral index ( -2 ) as a result of gas expulsion . in that case",
    ", it evolves within 13gyr into a cluster mass function similar to that of old globular clusters both in the inner and outer galactic halo ( see their fig .  4 ) .",

    "the universality of the globular cluster mass function may thus stem from the existence of an upper limit of , say , 25 per cent on the mean sfe in all protogalaxies .",
    "the origin of that constraint on the mean sfe in the protogalactic era remains to be explained , however .    in this preliminary study",
    ", the energy input rate from massive stars encompasses the contribution made by supernovae only , i.e. that of stellar winds has been neglected .",
    "consequently , the above results apply to the sole case of metal - poor environments .",
    "as noted in section  2 , we have assumed that the effect of gas expulsion depends on the actual star formation efficiency - i.e. we assume that the stars and gas ( potential ) are in virial equilibrium at the onset of gas expulsion .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if ( the stellar component of ) the cluster has had time to relax .",
    "a cluster will have been able to relax if the onset of gas expulsion occurs after a few crossing times . in a low - metallicity regime",
    "such as we are considering in this paper , gas expulsion will be driven by supernovae rather than stellar winds and so will not begin until a few myr after the stars have formed .",
    "such a time - scale is several crossing times , and so we could expect the esfe to closely match the sfe .",
