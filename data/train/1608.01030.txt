    "however , their large distances make the study of those bodies difficult , and our knowledge about their sizes , shapes , albedo , densities , and atmospheres remains fragmentary @xcite .    in the past 25 years , more than 1900 tnos and centaurs have been discovered ( minor planet center ( @xcitea , b ) ) . the stellar occultation technique is a very accurate tool to study those bodies , as it provides sizes and shapes at km - level ,",

    "were performed with the 60 cm telescope at pico dos dias observatory ( opd / lna - iau code 874 ) and with the 77 cm telescope at la hita observatory ( iau code i95 ) . from opd , 20 images with 45 s exposure time were acquired using johnson s i filter ( centered at 800 nm ) and an ikonl 9867 ccd camera on october 19 , 2014 . from la hita , 99 unfiltered images of 400 s exposure time were obtained on october , 29 , 30 and 31 , 2014 , with the 4k @xmath16 4k camera , which provided a very wide field of view of 47 @xmath16 47 arcmin . in both cases , the images were obtained at times when the objects were near the meridian , to minimize possible differential chromatic refraction ( dcr ) problems .",
    "unfortunately , since the apparent visual magnitude of the tno is approximately 20.1 , the signal to noise of 2007 uk@xmath0 in the individual exposures was poor ( around 4 to 8 , depending mainly on the seeing ) and did not allow us to obtain more accurate astrometry of the tno .    to derive accurate astrometry of 2007 uk@xmath0 ,",

    "the camera provides a field of view of 22 @xmath16 22 arcmin .",
    "exposure times were 400 s , which allowed us to obtain a signal to noise ratio on the target larger than 40 , with no filter .",

    "they were then excluded and the other 62 ( or 126 ) frames were averaged to obtain each image that corresponds to an individual exposure time . by not considering the first and last frame from a sequence , we avoid the need to de - interlace and re - interlace the frames , and we do not take into account any field from the previous or next sequence . note that this process also preserves the mid time of each image which was extracted from the mid - frame of each sequence .",
    "this method generates times with a systematic shift with respect to the absolute times ( one integration cycle ) but does not affect the final shape when all chords are processed the same way .",

    "for the occulted star , a photometric aperture of 7 pixels was used while for the sky background flux an annulus of 10 pixels inner radius and 16 pixels for the outer radius was used .",

    "the deviations from this set of steps is now described for each site in turn .",
    "the photometric extraction required some special handling in all cases .",
    "four nearby field stars were measured to obtain both position and flux . when the occultation star was visible , its position was also measured .",

    "all the resulting light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurves ] .",
    "as described by @xcite , the start and end times of the occultation were obtained for each light curve by fitting a sharp edge occultation model .",
    "this model is convolved by fresnel diffraction , the ccd bandwidth , the stellar apparent angular diameter in kilometers , and the finite integration time ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the fresnel scale ( @xmath19 ) for the geocentric distance d = 42.6 au ( or @xmath20 km ) of 2007 @xmath21 by the time of the event is approximately 1.4 km for a typical wavelength of @xmath22 @xmath23 m .",
    "the star apparent angular diameter is estimated using the formulae of @xcite .",
    "its b , v , and k apparent magnitudes are 16.2 , 15.6 , and 13.7 , respectively , in the nomad catalog @xcite .",
    "this yields a diameter of about 0.3 km projected at the distance of the 2007 @xmath21 . the smallest integration time used in the positive observations was 2",
    "s , which translates to almost 48 km in the celestial plane .",
    "therefore , the occultation light curves are largely dominated by the integration times , not by fresnel diffraction or the star diameter .",
    "the occultation fits consist of minimizing a classical @xmath24 function for each light curve , as described in @xcite .",
    "the free parameter to adjust is the ingress ( disappearance ) or egress ( re - appearance ) time , which provides the minimum value of @xmath24 denoted as @xmath25 .",
    "the best fits to the occultation light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurves ] , and the derived instants of ingress and egress are shown in table [ tab : instant_ingress_egress ] .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] that the disappearance and reappearance of the star is very clear with exception of the reno observation . the reno data required special care due to the degrading sky conditions after 10:18 ut . at first glance",
    ", the point in the light curve near 10:19:32 seems to indicate the start of the occultation .",
    "however , careful examination of this integration still shows a faint remnant of the star along with some image artifacts and leads to an anomalously low signal .",
    "the integration at 10:19:34 clearly shows the star and is the frame where ingress begins as the star is completely gone by the next integration . in general",
    ", one might think the point at 10:19:32 is perhaps indicating some other interesting lightcurve feature other than ingress . in this case , the degrading observing conditions argue that the measured flux from this integration is spurious and should be treated as an un - occulted timestep and that is what we adopt for the interpretation of those light curves .",
    "objects with diameter larger than about 1000  km are expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "as such , they reach either maclaurin spheroid or jacobi ellipsoid states @xcite .",
    "the critical diameter , defined as the minimum size necessary to reach hydrostatic equilibrium , can be estimated to 200 - 900 km for icy bodies or from 500 - 1200 km for rocky bodies @xcite .",
    "2007 uk@xmath0 is within those critical ranges and considering it is in the small angular momentum regime ( i.e. , the body presents a low rotation period with an estimated rotational period of 11.05 hours and it presents a small - amplitude rotational light curve with @xmath26 mag ) .",
    "thus , we will assume here that this tno is close to the maclaurin state .",
    "consequently , its limb is elliptical and is characterized by @xmath27 adjustable parameters : the coordinates of the body center , relative to the star in the plane of the sky ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) ; the apparent semi - major axis @xmath30 ; the apparent oblateness @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the apparent semi - minor axis ) ; and the position angle @xmath33 of the semi - minor axis @xmath32 .",

    ". the case @xmath40 ( respectively @xmath41 ) then corresponds to the pole - on ( respectively equator - on ) geometry .    note that 2007  uk@xmath0 s pole direction is currently unknown , so @xmath39 is undefined",
    "finally , it is useful to quantify the size of the body through its apparent equivalent radius @xmath42 ( rather than its equatorial radius @xmath43 ) defined by @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to the radius of the disk that has the same area as that enclosed by the apparent limb .",
    "the seven positive occultation chords provide @xmath45 data points ( the ingress and egress chord extremities , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nominalsolutiongbr ] and table [ tab : instant_ingress_egress ] ) , whose positions are denoted as @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the best elliptical fit to those points minimizes the radial residuals , from which the relevant @xmath24 function is defined .",
    "the quality of the fit is then assessed through the value of the @xmath24 function per degree of freedom ( or unbiased @xmath24 ) , defined as @xmath48 , see e.g. @xcite for details .",
    "the 1-@xmath17 level uncertainty of a given parameter is then obtained by varying it ( all the other parameters being re - adjusted during this exploration ) so that the @xmath24 function varies from its minimum value @xmath25 to @xmath49 .",
    "figs .  [ fig : nominalsolutiongbr ] and [ fig : nominalsolutionmwb ] display the best elliptical limb fits obtained from the two sets of timings ( gbr and mwb ) .",
    "note that the difference between the immersion and emmersion times comes from the fact that the determination of the instants is very sensitive to the photometry . since the star is very faint and",
    "its flux is close to the background sky flux , a small change on the light curve can induce different instants .",
    "although having slightly different times , the parameters derived from each method agree with each other at the 1-@xmath17 level ( table  [ tab : physical - parameters ] ) .",
    "moreover , the respective values of @xmath50 for the elliptical fits are under 0.7 , indicating satisfactory adjustements of the model to the data .",
    "purely circular shapes were also fitted to the data , resulting in @xmath51 values of 1.69 and 1.46 for the gbr and mwb timings , respectively .",
    "thus , although circular fits remain acceptable in terms of quality , they do degrade the value of @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , table  [ tab : physical - parameters ] shows that the apparent oblatenesses @xmath34 differ from zero at the @xmath15 2.5-@xmath17 level , a marginal detection of non - sphericity for 2007  uk@xmath0 .",
    "note that in both solutions the urbana chord seems a bit displaced towards east ( figs .",
    "[ fig : nominalsolutiongbr ] and [ fig : nominalsolutionmwb ] ) , compared to the elliptic model . since the tno is near the limit of the critical range to be a maclaurin object , we can consider two possibilities : ( 1 ) all the timings are correct within 1@xmath17 uncertainty , implying that 2007 uk@xmath0 is compatible with a maclaurin object and has large topographic features ( craters or mountains ) of the order of 10s of km ( a possible solution , considering the new horizons images on charon that shows topographic features as big as + /-",

    ", this implies that all sites had timing issues , some of them as big as one second ( half of the integration time ) , which is unlikely to happen .",
    "the fact that the observations are not repeatable makes difficult the assessment of timing errors .",
