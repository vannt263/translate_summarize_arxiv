    "it has been known that black objects with an extended event horizon , such as black branes and strings , suffer from a classical instability , called the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate fate of this instability remains a matter of investigation in spite of extensive studies ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and related works ) .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of this instability is the correlation with the local thermodynamic instability of background spacetimes .",
    "this correlation of instabilities is known as the gubser - mitra ( gm ) conjecture @xcite ( or the correlated stability conjecture  @xcite ) : the gl instability for black objects with a non - compact translational symmetry occurs if and only if the background black objects are locally thermodynamically unstable . supports based on a general semiclassical argument  @xcite and a lot of evidences have been known for this conjecture  @xcite .   however , mainly due to the difficulty to solve the complicated perturbation equations of black branes analytically , any conclusive proof of the conjecture has not been reported , as far as the author knows .",
    "since the gm conjecture plays crucial roles in the stability argument of black objects in string theory as well as in the holographically dual gauge theories  @xcite , it is important to prove the conjecture or have analytic evidence for it .",
    "now we turn to the complexity / simplicity of the perturbation equations of black branes .",
    "much effort has been devoted to simplifying the perturbation equations and to identifying analytically the gl modes . among them , the expression of perturbation equation obtained by kol @xcite would be simplest .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for the comparison between various gauges adopted in the literature .",
    "his gauge choice was optimized by the action formalism in which gauge fixing is postponed as much as possible and the action is transformed into a canonical form making use of its own invariance  @xcite .",
    "the resultant expression of perturbation equation is so simple that it allows for analytic investigations or accurate numerical ones .",
    "for example , an approximation formula of the dimensional dependence of gl marginal mode , which is sufficiently accurate in all dimensions , was obtained in  @xcite , while solving the perturbation equation for general dimensions is difficult even in such a gauge .    in this letter , we adopt the gauge mentioned above for the static perturbation of ( non - dilatonic ) magnetically charged black strings to obtain a single master equation . we show that if such a master equation is written in schrdinger form , the potential exhibits a significant feature :  the potential becomes positive definite to forbid the critical mode of gl instability for locally thermodynamically stable black strings .",
    "that is , one sees an explicit realization of the gm conjecture in this system .",
    "we consider the following @xmath0-dimensional action ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath2\\ ,      \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a @xmath4-form gauge field .",

    "( [ eq : sh ] ) that there is a critical value of the charge parameter , we denote it by @xmath23 , above which the specific heat becomes positive , @xmath24 the gm conjecture asserts that the gl instability does not exist for @xmath25 .",
    "we note that this criterion of thermodynamic stability corresponds to the one in a canonical ensemble .",
    "if a magnetic charge is allowed to be re - distributed in @xmath14-direction , which is not the case in the present spacetime , we have to take into account also the positivity of isothermal permittivity , corresponding to working in a grandcanonical ensemble  @xcite .",

    "also in the present charged case ( @xmath39 ) , in which the einstein equation has a source term of the gauge field , we can take the same gauge to obtain a master equation for @xmath33 .",
    "it is not so trivial that this gauge goes well even in the charged case .",
    "the point is that under ansatz ( [ eq : metric2 ] ) , the gauge field @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg ] ) remains to be a solution , i.e. , eom ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) and the bianchi identity are satisfied in this form . as a result ,",

    "the perturbation of form field can be written in terms of the perturbation of the metric .",
    "thus , the gauge field neither introduces any unknown function nor changes the structure of the einstein equations .",
