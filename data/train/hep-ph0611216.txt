    "the study of glueballs currently deserves much interest from a theoretical point of view , either within the framework of lattice qcd or effective models .",
    "their experimental detection is also an active field of research  for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . among the various effective approaches which have been proposed ( bag model @xcite , qcd in coulomb gauge @xcite ,  )",
    ", many studies have been devoted to potential models of glueballs . in this framework , glueballs are seen as bound states of two or more constituent gluons interacting via a phenomenological potential .",
    "early works on this subject are quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recent studies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    actually , the relevance of using a potential model to describe a glueball is still controversial . assuming that a potential model can be used",
    ", two basic questions then appear : what is the mass of a constituent gluon , and what is the potential ?",
    "the answer to these questions differ from one approach to another .",
    "let us begin by the problem of the mass .",
    "on the one hand , it is argued in some works that a gluon is a massless particle , which acquires a dynamical mass given by @xmath2 because of the confining interaction .",
    "relativistic , spin - dependent , corrections , are then developed in powers of @xmath3 @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the constituent gluon is _ a posteriori _ massive , because it is confined into a glueball , and this mass is state - dependent .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , more generally , both quarks and gluons can acquire a constituent mass from renormalization theory .",
    "this constituent mass runs with the momentum : one can look in particular at the coulomb gauge approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that massless gluons acquire a running mass which is about @xmath1 gev at zero momentum .",
    "the same approach can also be applied to compute the constituent mass of light quarks  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is often assumed in different studies that a constituent gluon has to be _ a priori _ considered as massive @xcite .",
    "the idea underlying these last approaches is roughly that the nonperturbative effects of qcd causes a mass term to appear in the gluon propagator .",
    "consequently , the gluons should be seen as massive particles , with a fixed mass which is typically assumed to be around @xmath4  gev @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections are then expanded as usual in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the typical value of @xmath6 in the second approach is compatible with the dynamical mass @xmath7 for the ground state in the first approach , and with the constituent gluon mass at zero momentum of the coulomb gauge model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we turn now our attention to the potentials appearing in the various existing models of qcd . in a two - body system ,",
    "the best - known phenomenological potential is the cornell one , which is roughly of the form @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the separation between the confined particles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath10 is the energy of a straight string of energy density @xmath11 , also called the flux tube , linking the quark to the antiquark and encoding the confining interaction .",
    "the coulomb part is the lowest order contribution of the one gluon exchange processes .",
    "the cornell potential arises from qcd in the case of a quark - antiquark bound state , as it can be shown by the wilson loop technique @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd computations of the energy between a static quark - antiquark pair also support this potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , background perturbation theory tells that the potential between two massless constituent gluons should also be of the cornell form @xcite . bound states of gluons with the cornell potential",
    "have been investigated for example in refs .",
    "but , as a linearly rising potential neglects string breaking effects , which have been observed in lattice qcd @xcite between static quarks , another confining potential is also often used , that is a saturating one of the form @xmath12 .",
    "as for the cornell one , models built on such a potential have been applied to usual hadrons @xcite , but also to glueballs @xcite .",
    "let us note that the short - range part corresponding to massive constituent gluons is not a coulomb term , but is proportional to the yukawa potential @xmath13 .",
    "> from this discussion , we can conclude that the best way of dealing with constituent gluons is still controversial .",
    "consequently , it is of particular interest to try to obtain relevant informations from more fundamental approaches such as lattice qcd .",
    "if the mass spectrum of pure gauge qcd  the glueball spectrum  is now accurately computed in lattice qcd @xcite , the potential energy between two constituent gluons has been much less studied than the quark - antiquark one . up to know ,",
    "the only method to obtain this energy with lattice qcd is to compute the energy between two static sources , these sources being in the adjoint representation of su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the cornell shape is then favored , as in the quark - antiquark case .",
    "however , nowadays , both the masses and wave functions of glueballs can be computed by lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "we propose in this paper a new method for extracting the potential between two constituent gluons from these lattice qcd data .",
    "such a method has the conceptual advantage of dealing with ",
    "physical \" glueballs rather than with somewhat artificial static sources .",
    "it is a direct application of the lagrange mesh procedure that we presented in ref .",

    "theoretical arguments also support this point @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) wave function of this scalar glueball has been first computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its mass was found to be around @xmath16  gev , which is lower than the currently accepted su(3 ) value .",

    "a fit with the levenberg - marquardt algorithm gives @xmath24 with a satisfactory agreement since the coefficient of determination is equal to @xmath25 , close to the optimal value of @xmath26 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",

    "( [ fit ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "in this work , we want to find a hamiltonian @xmath30 such that @xmath31 where @xmath27 and @xmath29 come from lattice qcd . this eigenequation is the main equation to be solved in the following . to our knowledge , this problem has never been addressed before .",
    "it is of particular interest in order to check the relevance of the approaches with constituent gluons .    in terms of potential models ,",
    "a glueball can be a bound state of two or more constituent gluons coupled in a color singlet .",
    "we point out that all the potential models agrees with the fact that the lowest @xmath0 should be a mainly two - gluon bound state @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quasiparticle picture of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge , also favors a bound state of two constituent gluons for the lowest @xmath0 .",
    "we will thus assume for @xmath30 a two - body standard form , i.e.    [ hamdef ] @xmath32 with a local potential @xmath33 and a semirelativistic kinetic term given by @xmath34    once the mass of the gluon , @xmath6 , as well as the radial and orbital quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 are specified ( @xmath37 for the lightest scalar glueball ) , the only unknown quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) is the local central potential @xmath33 , that we will compute in the following .",
    "it is worth underlining an important assumption that we make in this work : motivated by the standard representation of the @xmath0 glueball as a two - gluon bound state , we identify the lattice wave function @xmath27 , computed from plaquette operators , with the gluon - gluon component of the scalar glueball wave function .",
    "this hypothesis can be intuitively understood as follows .    a completely relativistic wave equation for a two - body system is provided by the well - known bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "in this formalism , the relativistic wave function @xmath38 ( also known as the bethe - salpeter wave function ) for a bound state @xmath39 of two particles @xmath40 and @xmath41 is defined as  @xcite @xmath42 in this last equation , @xmath43 is the vacuum state and @xmath44 is the creation operator for a particle @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 is the spacetime coordinate of particle @xmath45 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the @xmath50-momentum and the spacetime coordinate of the center of mass of the system respectively . the relativistic wave function  ( [ bswf1 ] ) can easily be linked to a schrdinger - like wave function .",
    "let us indeed work in the rest frame of the bound state @xmath39 .",
    "then , @xmath51 . in the usual nonretarded approximation @xmath52 ,",
    "one has @xmath53 since the time coordinate @xmath54 only appears as a global phase , only the spatial separation @xmath55 , computed in the rest frame of the configuration , is now relevant .",
    "formula  ( [ bswf2 ] ) can then straightforwardly be applied to the gluon - gluon component of a glueball state @xmath56 . indeed , if @xmath57 denotes the creation operator of a gluon , the corresponding bethe - salpeter wave function at @xmath58 is given by @xcite @xmath59 where the summation on @xmath60 and the integration on the angular part @xmath61 enforce a particular spin and angular symmetry of the wave function , following the state which is considered .",
    "equation  ( [ bswf3 ] ) can thus be identified as the gluon - gluon wave function for a particular stationary glueball state , in the rest frame of the system .",
    "interestingly , the wave function  ( [ bswf3 ] ) is precisely what is computed in the lattice qcd studies of refs .",
    "@xcite for the lightest glueball states .",
    "the key point to perform such a calculation is the evaluation of the two - gluon operator @xmath62 , which is achieved on the lattice by computing the correlation matrix between two plaquettes at the different points @xmath63 and @xmath64 . from this discussion , we can justify the identification of the lattice wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite with the schrdinger - like wave function of a bound state made of two gluons .",
    "several methods exist to compute the equivalent local potential from a given wave function and its corresponding energy ( see ref .",

    "equation  ( [ effpot1 ] ) requires the knowledge of the wave function at the mesh points @xmath80 .",
    "so , it is more efficient to work with the trial wave function  ( [ fit ] ) than with interpolated points between the few available lattice data .    the first numerical parameter is the number of mesh points , @xmath65 , that we set equal to @xmath81 ( although @xmath82 already gives a good picture of the potential @xcite ) .",

    "but , these potentials are clearly nonlocal .",
    "up to our knowledge , there is no physical indication that the interaction between two gluons could be non local .",
    "we thus compute the unique local potential @xmath33 for the @xmath0 state that we are studying .",
    "consequently , the only possibility is @xmath98 , for which @xmath99 .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath100 in the kinetic operator  ( [ tdef ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a model in which the gluons are assumed to be massless . with the scale parameter defined by eq .",
    "( [ hdef ] ) , we can apply formula  ( [ effpot1 ] ) .",
    "results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the potential obtained by using the optimal values of @xmath29 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 clearly exhibits a confining long - range part , and a rapidly decreasing short - range part .",
    "the errors on these three parameters ( see eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) ) allow the  true \" potential to be located between two extremal curves .",
    "we have checked that the curves obtained remain stable for different values of @xmath89 , @xmath65 , and @xmath77 .",
    "these numerical results are compatible with the following cornell potential @xmath101 in this expression , @xmath102 is the strong coupling constant , that we set equal to @xmath103 as in the case of the static quark - antiquark potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath104 factor is the color factor coming from the one gluon exchange between two gluons when the pair is in a color singlet . in the confining part , @xmath105 is the fundamental quark - antiquark flux tube energy density .",
    "it is usually assumed to be around @xmath106  gev@xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath108 indicates the scaling of the energy density which is different for a gluon - gluon system or a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "it is generally assumed to be given by @xmath109 ( casimir scaling ) @xcite , or by @xmath110 ( square root of casimir scaling ) @xcite .",
    "the last constant , @xmath111 , is used to fit the height of potential  ( [ corn ] ) on the numerically computed optimal potential .",
    "the cornell potential with @xmath112 is closer to the optimal curve than the one with the casimir scaling .",
    "however , the interaction with @xmath112 demands that @xmath113  gev .",
    "this positive constant is somewhat surprising . indeed",
    ", one expects that the parameter @xmath111 encodes some relativistic corrections to the cornell potential .",
    "talking of such relativistic corrections , like spin - orbit or spin - spin terms , is meaningful even in the case of massless gluons , since these corrections are expressed in terms of powers of @xmath3 , with a rather large value for @xmath114 , the dynamical gluon mass generated by the confinement @xcite .",
    "indeed , a computation of @xmath7 with the fitted wave function  ( [ fit ] ) leads to @xmath115  gev .",
    "since we consider here a @xmath116 state , the only remaining relativistic corrections are retardation terms and contact ( spin - spin ) interactions , which are both negative in this case @xcite .",
    "the casimir scaling seems thus more satisfactory since it is compatible with a vanishing value of @xmath111 and it is still located in the allowed region .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the very short - range part of the numerically computed potential is less singular than the coulomb potential .",
    "this part is actually very sensitive to the short - range behavior of the wave function .",
    "it has been shown that the wave function of a true semirelativistic coulomb problem diverges in @xmath117 @xcite , but such a divergence can not be computed in lattice calculations . anyway",
    ", more points should be necessary to elucidate this short - range behavior .",
    "let us note that the ground state masses of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamdef ] ) with the two fitted potentials  ( [ corn ] ) are respectively @xmath118  gev and @xmath119  gev with @xmath120 and @xmath112 .",
    "these values are contained in the error bars of @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding wave function with @xmath112 is nearly indistinguishable of the optimal wave function  ( [ fit ] ) , while the one for @xmath120 decreases more quickly .",
    "this is coherent with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we can see that the cornell potential with the casimir scaling increases faster than the optimal curve , consequently leading to a faster decreasing wave function .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is argued in many works that the constituent gluons should have a fixed nonzero mass , typically around @xmath4  gev @xcite .",
    "the effective gluon - gluon potential can also be computed by using our method . in order to clearly see the changes between @xmath100 and @xmath121 ,",
    "we have computed the effective potential for a rather large but still relevant value of @xmath6 , namely @xmath1  gev .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath33 drastically changes when @xmath121 . instead of a monotonically increasing potential",
    ", it now seems to saturate at some energy scale .",
    "such a saturation suggests an interpretation in terms of string breaking effects , which have been measured in lattice qcd in the case of a static quark - antiquark pair .",
    "thus , the optimal potential of fig .  [ fig3 ] should no longer be compared to a cornell form .",
    "however , in a pioneering work about glueballs as bound states of massive gluons by cornwall and soni @xcite , it is suggested that the gluon - gluon potential at lowest order reads @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the spin of the glueball .",
    "this potential clearly saturates at a value @xmath124 , then forbidding bound states with a mass greater than @xmath125 . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the confining part reduces to @xmath127 , and a linearly rising confining potential is recovered . by comparison with the cornell potential  ( [ corn ] ) , one could expect that @xmath128 which provides us with a definition of @xmath129 in terms the more intuitive parameters @xmath6 and @xmath105 .",
    "some useful remarks can also be made about the short - range part of the potential  ( [ cornw ] ) , i.e the part which is proportional to @xmath130 .",
    "firstly , it involves a yukawa potential instead of a coulomb one , because both exchanged gluons and constituent gluons are massive .",
    "moreover , it is spin - dependent even at the lowest order .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of effective potential with massive gluons .",
    "other spin - dependent corrections in @xmath5 also exist , but we do not mention them since they are absorbed in the constant @xmath111 by definition .",
    "again , this constant is fitted so that the absolute height of the optimal potential is recovered .",
    "it is readily observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that potential  ( [ cornw ] ) fits rather well the numerically computed potential , in particular the long - range behavior , for @xmath131  gev@xmath21 . for comparison",
    ", we notice that @xmath132  gev@xmath21 when @xmath120 and @xmath133  gev@xmath21 when @xmath112 .",
    "but , as we argued in the previous section , the short - range part is only poorly known with the current lattice data .",
    "the difference between @xmath120 and @xmath110 is less important than for the cornell potential even if the casimir scaling seems closer to the optimal curve when the usual value @xmath134  gev@xmath107 is used .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we fitted @xmath135 , which is higher than in the case of massless gluons .",
    "but , such a value is commonly used in models with massive gluons @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the ground state masses of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamdef ] ) with the two fitted potentials  ( [ cornw ] ) are respectively @xmath136  gev and @xmath137  gev with @xmath120 and @xmath112 .",
    "again , these values are contained in the error bars of @xmath29 . in this case , the corresponding wave functions with both values of @xmath108 are very similar to each other , but with a slightly larger spatial extension than the optimal wave function  ( [ fit ] ) .      a plot of the effective potential for different values of @xmath6 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in order to see more clearly the evolution of the potential shape with an increasing gluon mass .",
    "it is readily observed that there is a transition between a linearly rising regime at zero mass and a saturating one at high gluon mass .",
    "as we already pointed out , the short - range behavior of the computed potentials is rather poorly known because of the current precision of the lattice data .",
    "however , interesting informations can be deduced concerning the long - range part of the potential , typically for @xmath138  gev@xmath21 .",
    "one can find indeed that the different potentials computed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] can be correctly described at large @xmath9 by the following form @xmath139 with @xmath140 a fitted parameter .",
    "such a form has the advantage of having a non trivial limit for @xmath100 , which is simply the linearly rising potential @xmath141 . when @xmath121 however , it saturates at the value @xmath142 .",
    "potential  ( [ vfit ] ) has been plotted for the different values of @xmath6 that we considered , with the previously found values of @xmath105 , that is @xmath106  gev@xmath107 .",
    "we fixed @xmath112 because we already saw in sec .",
    "[ massless ] that the optimal numerically computed potential was better reproduced with that value of @xmath108 .",
    "but , again , we stress that the precision on the potential does not allow to decide whose scaling law is the best one .",
    "the constant @xmath111 have been fitted for each @xmath6 in order for the potential  ( [ vfit ] ) to have the right absolute height .    in the previous section",
    ", we showed that the potential obtained with @xmath143  gev can be well reproduced by the form  ( [ cornw ] ) , whose long - range part is a priori inequivalent to the potential  ( [ vfit ] ) .",
    "actually , both expressions coincide if @xmath144 with @xmath134  gev@xmath107 , this relation states that potentials  ( [ cornw ] ) and ( [ vfit ] ) are identical for @xmath145  gev when @xmath112 , and @xmath146  gev for @xmath120 .",
    "remarkably , this corresponds to a gluon mass around @xmath1  gev , that is the case that we treated previously .",
    "in this work , we have shown how to compute the effective potential between two gluons from the mass and wave function of the @xmath0 state obtained in lattice qcd , reasonably assuming that the lattice wave function mainly gives the gluon - gluon part of the glueball schrdinger - like wave function .",
    "this method , which is here used for the first time , has the advantage of allowing to deal with semirelativistic kinematics , which is necessary to include massless gluons systems in the discussion .",
    "the relevance of potential models to describe gluons is still a matter of controversy nowadays . in particular",
    ", the mass of a constituent gluon is an open problem : should it be zero or not ?",
    "arguments favoring both hypothesis can be found in the literature , so we computed the effective gluon - gluon potential in both cases .",
    "when the constituent gluons are massless , the potential we find is compatible with a cornell one for standard values of the parameters .",
    "when the constituent gluons are massive however , the effective potential is merely compatible with a saturating one with a yukawa - type short - range part .",
    "these results go beyond the usual computation of the static potential between two static sources in the adjoint representation . in this work indeed , we started from pure gauge results in lattice qcd and we showed that the constituent gluon picture naturally emerges from these lattice data .",
    "this could yield an a posteriori justification of the success of potential models in the description of the glueball spectrum .",
    "moreover , we showed that the allowed shape of the potential is constrained by the mass of the constituent gluon ( see eq .",
    "( [ vfit ] ) ) : the linear confinement or the saturating one are only valid for massless or massive gluons respectively .",
    "although the casimir scaling seems favored , the current precision of the lattice data does not allow to decide which scaling law is correct .",
    "this problem could be solved by making high precision computations of the wave function .",
    "we mention however the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the behavior of a quark - antiquark - constituent gluon system is investigated on the lattice , with results in agreement with the casimir scaling hypothesis .    an important application of our method is that , provided accurate wave functions for glueballs with a higher total spin are computed ( too few points are currently available for the @xmath147 wave function @xcite ) , spin - dependent terms  vanishing for the scalar glueball  could be studied .",
    "this would be a check of the relevance of approaches with massless or massive constituent gluons .",
    "indeed , potentials coming from both models already differ at the lowest order for what concerns spin - dependent terms .",
    "we consequently think that a very accurate determination of the wave functions of the lightest @xmath0 and @xmath147 glueballs in lattice qcd , especially at short range , could serve as a check to determine the most relevant potential approach of glueballs .",
    "we expect that , provided these wave functions are known , our method should lead to numerically computed potentials with a common long - range behavior  confinement is indeed not supposed to depend on @xmath148 . on the contrary , the short - range behavior should be different , and give important informations about the relativistic corrections .",
    "we hope to present such a study in future works .",

    "<S> starting from the @xmath0 glueball mass and wave function computed from lattice qcd , we compute the local potential between two constituent gluons . since the properties of constituent gluons are still a matter of research , we allow for them to be either massless , or massive with a mass around @xmath1  gev . </S>",
    "<S> both pictures are actually used in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> when the gluons are massless , the corresponding local potential is shown to be compatible with a cornell form , that is a linear confinement plus a short - range coulomb part , with standard values for the flux tube energy density and for the strong coupling constant . when the gluons are massive , the confining potential is a saturating one , commonly used to simulate string - breaking effects . </S>",
    "<S> these results fill a gap between lattice qcd and phenomenological models : the picture of the scalar glueball as a bound state of two constituent gluons interacting via a phenomenological potential is shown to emerge from pure gauge lattice qcd computations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the allowed potential shape is constrained by the mass of the constituent gluons . </S>"
