    "in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) brane world scenario the visible universe is a 3-brane boundary of a @xmath0 symmetric 5-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) orbifold @xcite .",
    "there are two basic settings . on one hand the rs1 model @xcite with two branes and a compactified fifth dimension and on the other the rs2 model @xcite with a single brane which may be associated with an infinite fifth dimension . with two branes",
    "the hierarchy problem is reformulated introducing an exponential warp in the fifth dimension .",
    "the gravitational field is localized on the hidden positive tension brane and decays towards the visible negative tension brane thus producing an exponential hierarchy between the planck and weak energy scales . in the rs2 model",
    "the same warping of the fifth dimension ensures that the graviton is bound to the brane .    in the rs models the classical field dynamics",
    "is defined by 5-dimensional einstein equations with a negative bulk cosmological constant @xmath1 , dirac delta sources representing the branes and a stress - energy tensor describing other bulk field modes @xcite-@xcite . in the rs2 model",
    "a set of vaccum solutions is given by    @xmath2    where the 4-dimensional line element @xmath3 is ricci flat , @xmath4 is the ads radius given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the fundamental 5-dimensional planck mass .",
    "the brane cosmological constant is fine - tuned to be zero giving @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the brane tension . due to the periodicity and",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry of the rs orbifold these solutions also hold for the rs1 model .",
    "then the two branes have opposite tensions and @xmath9 is the tension of the hidden planck brane .",
    "the low energy theory of gravity on the brane is 4-dimensional general relativity and the cosmology may be friedmann - robertson - walker @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the rs1 model this has only been achieved if a scalar field is introduced in the bulk to stabilize the size of the fifth dimension @xcite .",
    "the problem of the gravitational collapse of matter was also investigated in the rs scenario @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found that a black string solution first discussed in a different context by myers and perry @xcite induced the schwarzschild metric on the brane @xcite .",
    "however for such a solution the kretschmann scalar diverged both at the ads horizon and at the black string singularity @xcite .",
    "the solution is thus expected to be unstable @xcite .",
    "it may decay to a black cylinder localized near the brane which is free from naked singularities @xcite .",
    "so far this continues to be a conjecture .",
    "indeed , while exact solutions interpreted as static black holes localized on a brane have been found for a 2-brane embedded in a 4-dimensional ads space @xcite , a static black hole localized on a 3-brane remains unknown .",
    "the difficulty lies in the simultaneous localization of gravity and matter near the brane without the creation of naked singularities in the bulk @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this has inspired another conjecture stating that @xmath10-dimensional black hole solutions localized on a @xmath11-brane should correspond to quantum corrected @xmath12-dimensional black holes on the brane @xcite .",
    "related to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite this connection provides an extra motivation to look for 5-dimensional collapse solutions localized on a brane .",
    "there are also many braneworld solutions , obained from the effective 4-dimensional point of view by the application of the covariant gauss - codazzi formulation @xcite , that have so far not been associated with exact 5-dimensional spacetimes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this proceedings we report on research about the dynamics of a spherically symmetric 3-brane when conformal fields are present in the bulk @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we focus on 5-dimensional solutions which describe the dynamics of polytropic dark energy on the brane @xcite .",
    "let us start by introducing @xmath13 as coordinates in the 5-dimensional bulk .",
    "the most general metric consistent with the @xmath0 symmetry in @xmath14 and with 4-dimensional spherical symmetry on the brane is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath0 symmetric functions .",

    "let us first assume that under the conformal transformation @xmath25 the bulk stress - energy tensor has conformal weight @xmath26 ,    @xmath27    then eq . ( [ 5deeq ] ) may be re - written as    @xmath28\\;. \\label{t5deeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly under the conformal transformation the conservation equation becomes    @xmath29=0\\label{t5dceq}\\;.\\ ] ]    if in addition it is assumed that @xmath30 then eq .

    "( [ r5deeq ] ) and ( [ r5dceq ] ) are 5-dimensional einstein equations with matter fields present in the bulk but without a brane or bulk cosmological constant .",
    "they do not depend on the conformal warp factor which is dynamically defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 5deeqwf ] ) and ( [ 5dceqwf ] ) .",
    "the warp is then the only effect reflecting the existence of the brane or of the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we stress that this is only possible for the special class of bulk fields which have a stress - energy tensor with conformal weight @xmath35 .",
    "thought now partially decoupled the 5-dimensional einstein equations are still difficult to solve .",
    "note for instance that the warp depends non - linearly on the metric functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath21 .",
    "so let us further assume that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "the warp is now independent of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath21 .",
    "it may be chosen to be the rs factor @xcite    @xmath49    naturally , other warp factors depending only on @xmath14 such as those of thick branes @xcite and non - fine - tuned branes @xcite may also be considered ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "the highly coupled 5-dimensional collapse dynamics has been reduced to 4-dimensional dynamics .",
    "consider a diagonal stress - tensor ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the bulk matter density and pressures .",
    "( [ eqst2 ] ) is re - written as @xmath55 the collapse of the conformal bulk matter is in general inhomogeneous and defined by eq .",

    "the matter dynamics generates a pressure @xmath54 along the fifth dimension which must consistently be given by eqs .",
    "( [ 5deeqz ] ) and ( [ eqst3 ] ) .",
    "to behave as polytropic dark energy the stress - energy tensor should be of the form ( [ bmten ] ) where the bulk matter density @xmath51 and pressures @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by    @xmath56    above @xmath57 defines the polytropic dark energy density and the parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) characterize different polytropic phases . in what follows",
    "we restrict our attention to the generalized chaplygin phase characterized by @xmath60 @xcite .    the polytropic energy density @xmath57 is obtained by solving the conservation equations in eq . ( [ 4deeq ] ) which in this case reads    @xmath61",
    "taking an homogeneous density @xmath62 , the metric function @xmath63 may be safely set to zero .",
    "then since the off - diagonal einstein equation @xmath64 has solution @xmath65 with @xmath66 an arbitrary function of @xmath67 we obtain    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is an integration constant and @xmath70 is the robertson - walker scale factor of the brane world which is related to the physical radius by @xmath71 .    at small @xmath72 the chaplygin dynamics",
    "is dominated by the homogeneous dust phase with @xmath73 .",
    "the chaplygin gas has an intermediate phase defined by the equation of state @xmath74 which satisfies the dominant energy condition . for large @xmath72 the dynamics is dominated by an effective cosmological constant term .",
    "an evolution of the chaplygin equation of state may thus describe the change in the dark energy behavior during the expansion of the universe .",
    "next consider the diagonal einstein equations in eq .",
    "( [ 4deeq ] ) . because @xmath75 it must be @xmath76 . as a consequence    @xmath77    where the constant @xmath78 is the robertson - walker curvature parameter . then substituting @xmath71 in    @xmath79    we obtain    @xmath80    on the other hand the radial equation @xmath81 leads to    @xmath82    naturally , eqs .",

    "( [ dmdyeqa ] ) , ( [ dmdyeq ] ) , ( [ hrweq ] ) and the expression for @xmath54 given in eq . ( [ dmeqst ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath83 is an identity for all the parameters of the model .    with @xmath84 given by eq .",

    "( [ dmdyeqa ] ) . thought obtained for the rs2 model these solutions also hold for the rs1 model due to the periodicity and the @xmath0 symmetry of the orbifold . in the rs1 model",
    "the two branes are then twin universes with opposite tensions and an identical cosmological evolution .",
    "let us now verify that if a 4-dimensional observer confined to the brane makes the same assumptions about the bulk degrees of freedom then she deduces exactly the same dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the non - zero components of the projected weyl tensor @xcite read    @xmath86    then the effective 4-dimensional dynamics is given by    @xmath87    the 4-dimensional observer also sees gravity confined to the brane since she measures a negative tidal acceleration @xcite given by    @xmath88    this implies that the geodesics just outside the brane converge towards the brane and so for the 4-dimensional observer the conformal bulk matter is effectively trapped inside the brane .",
    "the effective 4-dimensional chaplygin dynamics on the brane may lead to the formation of a shell focusing singularity at @xmath89 and of regular rebounce epochs at some @xmath90 .",
    "this can be analyzed @xcite with the following potential @xmath91 defined by    @xmath92    if for all @xmath93 it turns out that @xmath94 then a shell focusing singularity forms at @xmath89 .",
    "however , if an @xmath95 exists such that @xmath96 then there is a regular rebounce point at @xmath97 .",
    "according to recent experimental bounds @xcite the allowed range of values for @xmath59 and @xmath69 are @xmath98 and @xmath99 or @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for @xmath102",
    "the potential is positive for all @xmath60 if @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath100 and @xmath101 then this only happens for the set @xmath103 , @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , even and odd integers . in any of these cases",
    "there are only singular solutions without rebouncing epochs .",
    "the chaplygin shells may either expand continously to infinity or collapse to the singularity at @xmath89 where    @xmath107    it is for @xmath108 that new dynamics appears .",
    "with @xmath109 we find    @xmath110    consider @xmath111 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : l0ppp ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath112 is equivalent to @xmath113 where    @xmath114     for @xmath111 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the dashed , thin and thick lines correspond , respectively , to @xmath58 equal to @xmath115 and @xmath116    then there are at most two regular rebounce epochs in the allowed dynamical phase space . since we have    @xmath117    and @xmath118 this is determined by the sign of @xmath119 at its minimum @xmath120 where @xmath121 .    if @xmath122 then there are no regular rebounce points and the collapsing shells may fall from infinity to the singularity at @xmath89 where @xmath123 is given in eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath124 we have just one regular fixed point @xmath97 which divides the phase space into two disconnected regions , a bounded region with the singularity at @xmath89 , @xmath125 , and an infinitely extended region , @xmath126 , where the shells expand with ever increasing speed to infinity . in this region",
    "the solutions are regular .",

    "if @xmath135 then for @xmath98 and @xmath99 the potential is always positive and so there are only singular solutions without rebouncing points . for @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( see fig .  [ fig : l0nnn ] ) we must consider @xmath103 , @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , odd and even integers to find solutions with rebounce epochs .",
    "the condition @xmath112 is still equivalent to @xmath136 but now    @xmath137    because we have    @xmath138    and    @xmath139    the sign of @xmath119 at its maximum @xmath140 where @xmath141 shows that the only possibilities are the existence of one or two regular rebounce epochs .     for @xmath135 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "in this work we have presented new exact 5-dimensional solutions for which gravity is localized in the vicinity of the brane and the dynamics of the bulk fields on the brane is that of an homogeneous chaplygin gas , a possible candidate for the missing dark energy which controls the expansion of the visible universe .",
    "the bulk fields were seen to belong to a special conformal class which has a stress - energy tensor with conformal weight @xmath144 .",
    "we have seen that the 5-dimensional solutions are valid for the rs1 and the rs2 models and noted that an observer confined to the brane is led to the same localized braneworld dynamics when using an identical description of the field variables .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical phase space describing the evolution of the chaplygin shells discussing conditions for the formation of shell focusing singularities and of regular rebounce epochs .",
    "however , althought gravity is bound to the brane the conformal bulk fields are not localized near the brane .",
    "indeed , the density and pressures increase with @xmath14 due to the scale factor @xmath145 and diverge at the ads horizon .",
    "this is not a problem in the rs1 model because the space is cut before the ads horizon is reached . in the rs2 model a solution requires the simultaneous localization of bulk matter and gravity near the brane , an open problem for future research .",
