    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) consist of a roche - lobe filling main sequence star , called the secondary star , orbiting a white dwarf - the primary star .",
    "mass flows from the secondary star through the inner lagrangian point towards the primary star , ultimately leading to the formation of an accretion disc ( ad ) . after the ad s formation ,",
    "a bright spot ( bs ) is formed at the contact point where the gas stream hits the ad .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a subclass of cataclysmic variables with two different brightness states , quiescence and outburst . in the latter ,",
    "the system usually brightens by 25mag with a time - scale that can vary from tens to hundreds of days .",
    "dne can also show a third brightness state , the superoutburst , where the system brightens by typically an additional magnitude or two compared to normal outburst .",
    "ip peg is the brightest eclipsing ( @xmath5 ) dn above the period gap , and was discovered by @xcite .",
    "it has a 3.8-h orbital period and a @xmath6 magnitude in the range of 1412mag , the extreme values corresponding to quiescence and outburst , respectively .    from the first photometric light curves during quiescence and",
    "return to quiescence @xcite , it was evident that the bs produces a prominent orbital hump , when it rotates into view from behind the disc with a single - stepped ingress and double - stepped egress superimposed on a more gradual disc - eclipse .",
    "infrared light curves showed 0.2mag ellipsoidal variations from the secondary star superposed on a deep eclipse of the wd and the bs @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on the analysis of 39 eclipses , found out that ip peg has a rapidly increasing orbital period .",
    "however , a new study performed by @xcite and combining 49 eclipses along with previously reported ones , reached the conclusion that the orbital period varies sinusoidally with a period of 4.7 years .",
    "this variation they attributed to a third body , a late m dwarf star with a most probable mass of 0.10@xmath7 .",
    "they also showed that the rate of shrinkage in disc radius during decline from outburst is constant during different outburst cycles , following an exponential decay .",
    "a study of the flickering in ip peg @xcite showed that the bs is the dominant source of flickering , with the ad and wd contributing practically nothing .",
    "spectroscopy of the red star @xcite showed tio bands and the nai doublet ( red dwarf features ) , several broad double - peaked emission lines ( disc features ) and a narrow third peak in the emission lines moving in anti - phase with the double peaks ( a chromospheric emission feature ) .",
    "@xcite performed a tio study of ip peg and concluded that tio instead of the nai doublet should be used for radial velocity studies of the secondary star . in this way they found that the contamination from disc emission , which in other studies returned an elliptical orbit , could be avoided and higher signal - to - noise ratio could be achieved .",
    "they gave a final projected orbital velocity of the companion star @xmath8 and refined values of the primary and secondary star masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "@xcite suggested that he emission can be explained as photoionisation of the disc by the boundary layer and found that balmer emission in outburst can be attributed by 3/4 to the disc , 1/4 to irradiation of the red star and also to boundary layer irradiation .",

    "a mirror eclipse also has a mirror - symmetry with the classical rotational disturbance , i.e. the red - shifted part of the line is eclipsed prior to the blue - shifted one .    even though ip peg had shown many peculiarities and novelties in the studies cited previously",
    ", it had to reveal another breakthrough .",
    "@xcite were the first to find convincing evidence for the existence of spiral structure in the ad of a close binary .",
    "spiral waves had long been predicted in studies of tidal interactions and numerical simulations ( see @xcite and references therein ) and may play a crucial role in our understanding of the angular momentum transport .",
    "@xcite obtained spectrophotometric observations of ip peg during the rise to an outburst , covering h@xmath4 and hei @xmath16678 .",
    "disc emission was centred on the wd and had a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the forms of two spiral arms .",
    "the repeatability of the two - armed spiral structure was confirmed during another outburst maximum .",
    "@xcite applied doppler tomography of the heii @xmath14686 line and clarified the shock nature of the spiral arms which showed a jump of a factor of more than 2 in intensity .",
    "additionally they calculated an azimuthal extent of 90@xmath11 , a 30@xmath11 upper limit in opening angle and a 15% contribution of the shocks to the total disc emission .",
    "@xcite showed that the spiral pattern persists even 5 and 6 days after the outburst maximum , without showing any diminution in strength .",
    "time - resolved optical spectra obtained during late outburst by @xcite reveal , through the eclipse mapping technique , that spirals are present even 8 days after the onset of an outburst .",
    "their study showed a similar contribution to the continuum emission , as that measured during the peak of the outburst but also a retrograde azimuthal rotation of 58@xmath11 compared to outburst maximum .",
    "@xcite performed a re - analysis of previous spectroscopic data of ip peg during outburst @xcite , based on the eclipse mapping technique .",
    "the difference in their new study was based on the fact that they separated the inner and outer regions of the emission line light curves , obtaining in this way the `` core '' and `` spiral arms '' lights curves , respectively . in this way they improved the previously noisy view of the spiral arms and",
    "were able to trace them in detail .",
    "the two - armed spiral structures were clearly visible in all their eclipse maps , albeit the `` blue '' arm appearing farther out from the disc s centre than the `` red '' one . however , their crucial findings were the sub - keplerian velocities along the spiral structures , as well as the clear correlation between the opening angle of the spirals and the outburst stage ( the later in the outburst , the smaller the opening angle of the spirals ) .",
    "both these findings greatly favour the interpretation of the spiral asymmetric structures as tidally - induced spiral shocks instead of mere radiation patterns on an otherwise unperturbed ad .",
    "a study performed by @xcite presents a review of the spiral structure that far , and plots in detail the azimuthal angles and extent of the spirals for the heii @xmath14686 emission line during an outburst presented by @xcite . in more detail",
    ", it is shown that the two spirals can be traced for almost 180@xmath11 , while their velocity varies from 495 to 780kms@xmath12 .",
    "under the assumption of keplerian velocities , they show that the arms cover a substantial part of the disc , 0.30.9 times the distance to the inner langragian point @xmath13 .",
    "it is pointed out that tracing the spiral arms and plotting their position and intensity as a function of azimuth throughout an outburst , or even better applying this procedure to a range of emission lines simultaneously , can yield important results on the evolution of the spirals . a future paper , as stated in the discussion section ,",
    "is intended to address this issue .",
    "a first approach on tracing the spiral arms of two different emission lines ( h@xmath4 , hei @xmath16678 ) , as well as plotting their emissivity as a function of azimuth , is presented in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , even though there is a similar position for the spirals in terms of velocity as a function of azimuth , the intensity modulation is significantly different .",
    "our work is part of a project of studying cvs through high resolution time - resolved echelle spectra and applying the indirect imaging technique of doppler tomography .",
    "the simultaneous study of several emission lines can yield important results on the ad structure , as presented for another cv system in @xcite . following the introduction on ip peg one can conclude on the benefits of applying such an analysis to this object , especially since it was observed during outburst . in this way we can study the behaviour of the spiral arms and map the structure of the ad in detail .",
    "the application of modulation doppler tomography , an extension of the classic doppler tomography method @xcite , gives us the opportunity to map emission sources which can vary harmonically with the orbital period .",

    "4 we perform the spectral analysis and sect .  5 deals with the application and results of modulation doppler tomography .",
    "last , sect .",
    "6 is devoted to the discussion and summary of our results .",
    "the observing run was conducted on the @xmath14 of august 1999 , at eso s ntt .",
    "echelle spectroscopy was performed using the remd mode of the emmi spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the echelle grating # 9 and cross - disperser # 3 resulted in 21 orders covering the wavelength range 40007500 .",
    "the dispersion increased between 0.09 and 0.17pix@xmath12 , from blue to red , respectively .",
    "ip peg was observed for 5.7h , covering 1.5 binary orbits . in total , 41 spectra with an exposure time of 300sec each , were obtained .",
    "[ f_aavso ] shows a long - term light curve of our system as generated from the aavso light curve generator tool , choosing only visual - validated data to appear , and a window of a few days around outburst .",
    "an inspection of the outburst maximum reveals that ip peg was at the peak of its outburst just 1 day before our observing run , when it was also 1 magnitude brighter .",
    "the resulting spectra were reduced using the standard echelle reduction procedures in _ iraf _ and the slit spectra reduction task doecslit .",
    "whenever , both an interactive and non - interactive mode existed for a task , the interactive one was always chosen .",
    "initially , the bias and lampflat frames were combined into one bias and flat frame with the zerocombine and flatcombine tasks , respectively .",
    "the spectra were then de - biased and a normalised flat was produced with the task apflatten in order to apply the flat - fielding process .",
    "apflatten , after finding and tracing all apertures ( defined as the sum of dispersion lines containing the signal of an order ) , also models both the profile and overall spectrum shape and removes it from the flat - field leaving only the sensitivity variations .",
    "the resulting normalised flat , if plotted perpendicular to the dispersion gives alternating smooth and noisy sections , smooth sections corresponding to the regions between the orders and having a value of 1 , and noisy sections corresponding to the regions inside the orders and having values fluctuating around 1 .",
    "the spectra were then divided by the normalised flat and thus flat - fielded . at this stage",
    ", the spectra were also corrected for cosmic rays with the use of the cosmicrays task , part of the crutil package .",
    "the task doecslit connects and combines several individual tasks to provide a single , complete data reduction path .",
    "it provides a degree of guidance , automation and record keeping . additionally , the user with the choice of the interactive mode ( used in this set of spectra ) and the use of a graphical interface , is able to be in control of the whole procedure , and if necessary , fine - tune the reduction process while it runs .",
    "the several steps involved in doecslit and therefore applied in the dataset are summarised as follows :    * in an aperture reference image , preferably a bright object , the orders were located and given a default fixed aperture width , which could be changed interactively if needed . * the background sample regions were inspected .",
    "the function fitting parameters could be set interactively in order to best subtract the background later on .",
    "* apertures were then defined for all object and standard star images , using as initial apertures , those defined from the aperture reference image .",
    "all images sequentially passed through this step .",
    "possible deviations between the aperture reference image and the rest of the images , were fixed interactively by re - tracing and re - centering the apertures of the images . * the actual extraction of the spectra",
    "was done using the _ variance _ option in the _ weights _ parameter of the sparams task of the echelle package .",
    "variance weighting , often called optimal extraction , is performed by summing the pixel values across each aperture at each point along the dispersion .",
    "each pixel in the sum is weighted by its estimated variance based on a spectrum model and the detector readout noise and gain parameters . for detailed information on the _ optimal _ extraction method",
    "the reader should refer to @xcite and @xcite , whose work was followed by _",
    "iraf_. * dispersion correction was then applied through the use of thorium - argon arc lamp spectra .",
    "initially , a few arc lines were identified in each order ( beginning , end and middle of the dispersion axis ) , making use of the th - ar line atlas provided by eso for the specific _ emmi _",
    "setup used in the observing run .",
    "additional lines were then automatically identified with the use of an identification th - ar line list available in _",
    "iraf_. a dispersion function was then fit to the total of identified lines in each order , and then applied to the corresponding orders of the rest of the images .",
    "the typical root mean square of the fits was @xmath150.012 . * for the flux calibration we used spectra of the spectrophotometric standard ltt 7379 .",
    "first , the bandpass regions were interactively defined and then the standard calibration data of ltt 7379 , available in _ iraf _ , were interpolated to the user - defined bandpasses .",
    "the flux values for each aperture were then fit with a smooth curve , in order to relate system sensitivity to wavelength for each aperture , thus resulting in a sensitivity curve for every aperture . *",
    "finally the standard star spectra were extinction corrected ( using the extinction file provided by eso for the location of the la silla observatory ) , and flux calibrated using the derived sensitivity curves .    as a last step in doecslit ,",
    "all previous steps were applied to all object spectra , resulting in the final flux - calibrated spectra of ip peg .",

    "we have applied to our data set , the modulation doppler tomography method , which in addition to the classic doppler maps reveals if any harmonically varying components are present in the system configuration .",
    "this is of great importance in sight of the spiral waves , which nevertheless have not shown any significant harmonically varying emission and therefore we can not claim anisotropic emission .",
    "the only line to show a hint of anisotropic emission , is the heii line , and only in the lower spiral arm and at a 6% level of the average emission , but this could be due to the blending of the line .",
    "however , the fact that for the majority of lines no modulated emission is seen from the spiral arms does not mean that the spirals do not modulate at all , but that no significant modulated contribution was needed to reproduce the observed data . at higher",
    "@xmath35 we may have seen some modulation .",
    "but , since we see features of amplitude a few % , this means that our @xmath35 rules out strong anisotropy in disc emission . we could therefore conclude that , if present , the modulated emission of the spiral arms is relatively weak at that our @xmath35 was good enough to put a lower detection limit of any modulated emission at 56% .",
    "the balmer and hei lines show strong secondary star emission , part of which is modulated .",
    "its level of emission decreases when moving from h@xmath3 to h@xmath4 . as stated in the previous section secondary star emission",
    "is naturally modulated with the cosine term .",
    "this is normal since irradiation induced emission from the secondary is phase dependent , so it is natural to see a flux variation when the phase is changing .",
    "given equation  3 of @xcite and that at phase 0.50.7 , the face on secondary should emit more , then the cosine term is the dominant component .",
    "all hei lines show modulated emission in 2 regions of the ad , but are at a very low level . only in @xmath14922",
    "do they appear more pronounced .",
    "these ad modulated regions , seem to appear in the `` gaps '' between the spiral arms and modulate with the sine - term",
    ". this could be in accordance with the spiral arms shielding the disc areas just behind them and hiding a possible cosine - term of disc modulated emission as well .",
    "moreover , the sine - term is expected considering their phasing is in between the spiral arms . geometric shielding caused by the spirals",
    "was also proposed from @xcite and shielding of the secondary star by the ad was proposed by @xcite . finally , most of the hei lines show modulated emission near the inner lagrangian point also covering a small region at the beginning of the stream trajectory .",
    "though , shows pronounced modulated emission for the bigger part of the stream trajectory .    in a future paper",
    "it is our aim to study the same dataset , but concerning the spiral arms of the different lines only .",
    "tracing , providing the amplitude , and the contribution to the total flux of the spiral arms of all lines , as well as finding the ratio of the brightness between the two spiral arms can yield valuable results for this unique set of time - resolved spectra .",
