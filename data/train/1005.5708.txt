    "it is widely believed that the solar magnetic cycle is driven by an @xmath1 dynamo .",
    "the region of strong radial shear called the tachocline @xcite at the bottom of the solar convection zone ( scz ) is believed to be the place where strong toroidal field is formed due to stretching of the weaker but diffuse poloidal field .",
    "it has been inferred from helioseismology that the tachocline is confined within a thin layer in the overshoot region which lies below the scz .",
    "this led @xcite to propose the idea of an interface dynamo , where the shear is confined to a region with a greatly reduced turbulent diffusion , which also is the region of production of strong toroidal field . the helical turbulence generated due to convection and rotation in the layer above",
    "provides the turbulent @xmath0 and a large turbulent diffusivity @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamo cycle being thus completed , the interface dynamo operates as a surface wave propagating along the boundary between strong shear and convection , which is also a region with a strong gradient in the turbulent diffusivity .    in order to mimic the process of dynamo saturation ,",
    "traditionally authors have used an algebraic quenching function like @xmath4 or even @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the unquenched value of @xmath0 , @xmath7 is the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath8 is the mean magnetic field and @xmath9 is the equipartition magnetic field .",
    "however , it appears that conservation of magnetic helicity plays an important role in the process of saturation . at large @xmath7 ,",
    "the magnetic helicity ( @xmath10 ) is fairly well conserved by the dynamo producing equal amounts of helicity in small and large scales , respectively . if the small - scale magnetic helicity is not able to escape out of the system , then the turbulent @xmath0 effect is markedly reduced @xcite .",
    "this leads to the magnetic energy of the dynamo to be quenched such that the saturation value varies as @xmath11 . since astrophysical objects have large @xmath7 ( @xmath12 for the sun ) , this strong dependence of the saturation field strength @xmath13 on @xmath7 is referred to as _",
    "catastrophic quenching_.    even though the helicity constraint in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of dynamos with strong shear has been clearly identified , the results can be matched with mean - field models having a weaker algebraic quenching of @xmath0 and turbulent diffusivity than @xmath14 dynamos @xcite .",
    "however , the empirically determined coefficients would depend on circumstances and are therefore not universal .",
    "such a model would not obey magnetic helicity evolution and is therefore untenable on theoretical grounds .",
    "the interface dynamo model has been invoked several times as a way of getting around the persistent problem of catastrophic quenching ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the belief is that the quenching function remains close to unity in the region of finite @xmath0 since the toroidal field is expected to be weak there .",
    "however , to our knowledge , this has never been verified in a consistent manner for a range of magnetic reynolds numbers . in this paper",
    "we perform a series of calculations with mean - field @xmath1 models , in spherical geometry , considering both algebraic and dynamical quenching formulations , for magnetic reynolds numbers in the range @xmath15 .",
    "an important feature of these models is that the region of strong narrow shear is separated from the region of helical turbulence as proposed in the parker s interface model .",
    "in  2 we discuss the features of the @xmath1 model used , and the formulation of dynamical @xmath0 quenching .",
    "the results are highlighted in  3 and conclusions are drawn in  4 . a part of the calculations presented in this paper will be discussed in a more detailed paper @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus specifically on the reality of the catastrophic quenching in dynamos with @xmath0 and @xmath16 effects operating in two widely separated layers .",
    "our dynamo model consists of the induction equations for the toroidal component of the mean poloidal field potential , @xmath17 , and the mean toroidal magnetic field , @xmath18 , written in spherical geometry under the assumption of axisymmetry ( @xmath19 ) . in some of the cases an additional evolution equation",
    "will be solved for the @xmath0 effect ( described in the next section ) .",

    "somewhat arbitrarily , we use @xmath26 , which corresponds to a harmonic wave with 2 nodes spanning the full latitudinal extent between both poles .",
    "we also define the wavenumber of the energy - carrying eddies , @xmath27 , corresponding to the inverse pressure scale height near the base of the convection zone . for all our calculations",

    "however , under the assumption of scale separation , i.e.  when the correlation length of the turbulence is small compared to the system size , one can define a magnetic helicity density of small - scale fields in a gauge - independent manner as the density of linkages @xcite .",

    "we have checked that the results are not very sensitive to different boundary conditions at the bottom boundary mainly because the boundary is far removed from the dynamo region . since @xmath66 ,",
    "no derivatives of @xmath58 need to be evaluated , so no boundary conditions need to be specified for @xmath58 and its evolution equation is just an initial value problem .",
    "we start with an initial dipolar solution where @xmath74 is antisymmetric about the equator .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : butter2 ] the butterfly diagrams for @xmath74 and @xmath58 at a depth of 0.72@xmath84 .",
    "it may be concluded from the butterfly diagram for @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : butter2]b that the small - scale current helicity , and hence @xmath58 , is predominantly negative ( positive ) in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere .",
    "let us denote the exponential decay time for @xmath58 by @xmath85 .",
    "so , @xmath86 . for @xmath87 , the decay time @xmath88 and so the system of equations is overdamped , as can be seen from the butterfly diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : butter2]a as well as from saturation curve ( dashed dotted line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy3 ] .",
    "note that there are amplitude modulations of the magnetic field before it settles to a final saturation value .",
    "the nature of the saturation curves of the magnetic energy is thus strongly governed by the ratio of @xmath85 and @xmath48 .",
    "the results of our calculations for different reynolds numbers are plotted in fig  [ fig : energy3 ] .",
    "the slopes in the kinematic phase are similar for all @xmath81 within the error in the numerical determination of the critical @xmath89 .",
    "the strong @xmath81 dependence , which is reminiscent of catastrophic quenching in large @xmath7 dynamos , can be easily discerned from the same figure , but is more clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : satrm ] where we see that the saturation energy decreases monotonically as a function of magnetic reynolds number . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the code has to be run for 500 @xmath49 before the dynamo fields may start becoming ` strong ' again for the case with @xmath91 .",
    "due to long computational times involved in this exercise we have not continued the calculation beyond 60 @xmath49 . hence the determination of saturation magnetic energy may be inaccurate for @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : satrm ] we compare the case with dynamical quenching against the cases with a simple algebraic quenching of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphak ] ) with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath94 , the algebraically and dynamically quenched @xmath0 effects seem to give similar dependences on @xmath81 .    when the code is run longer , we start seeing changes in the parity after @xmath95 for the dynamically quenched system in contrast to the  strong algebraic quenching case , where the parity remains dipolar .",
    "however the magnetic energy and the dynamo period @xmath48 remain fairly constant even while the system fluctuates between symmetric and anti - symmetric parity at an irregular time interval .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] we show the meridional snapshots in the northern hemisphere of the toroidal component of the magnetic field and @xmath58 .",
    "it may be noted that the regions strongest in @xmath74 become progressively confined in the narrow shear layer with increasing @xmath81 while @xmath58 becomes stronger leading to decrease in @xmath13 . even though @xmath58 is predominantly negative in the northern hemisphere",
    "there is a region of positive small - scale helicity generated just below the region where @xmath31 is finite so that contribution from the term @xmath96 in the source @xmath97 is small .",
    "this effect is similar to the one reported in @xcite .",
    "we also have not observed any evidence of chaotic behaviour in the range of magnetic reynolds number @xmath98 for twice supercritical @xmath0 ( @xmath99 ) , in agreement with @xcite",
    "the calculations done in this paper indicate that it is not possible to escape catastrophic quenching due to accumulation of small - scale helicity in the domain by merely separating the regions of shear and @xmath0 effect . the saturation value of magnetic energy decreases as @xmath100 for both dynamical quenching and the ` strong ' ( @xmath101-dependent ) form of algebraic quenching for the simple two - layer model . however , additionally we observe parity fluctuations for cases with dynamical quenching",
    ". it does not seem to us that there exists any chaotic behaviour in the time series of magnetic energy since the dynamo period and the saturation energy remains fairly constant .",
    "it may be possible that solar wind , coronal mass ejections , and vishniac and cho fluxes help in throwing out the small scale helicity from the sun and thus alleviate catastrophic quenching . in this study",
    "we have not found any difference between the nature of the saturation curves for an @xmath1 dynamo and an @xmath14 dynamo using the form of dynamical quenching given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphaeq ] ) . however , it is clear that the algebraic quenching formula must fail if we were to allow for magnetic helicity fluxes that would , under suitable circumstances , alleviate catastrophic quenching .",
    "we have been cautious about using dynamical quenching equation for dynamo numbers not very large compared to the critical dynamo numbers .",
    "we would expect that the magnetic field should affect all the turbulence coefficients including both @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "however for this analysis we have not included any quenching of @xmath3 .",
    "this may be justified since such an effect could be mimicked by our simple two - layer model with a lower @xmath3 in the region of production of strong toroidal fields and a higher @xmath3 in the region of weaker poloidal fields .",
    "the effect of dynamical quenching on more realistic solar dynamo models having meridional circulation , babcock - leighton @xmath0 effect , and diffusive helicity fluxes have also been studied @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the direct numerical simulations have not yet reached the modest reynolds numbers used in this paper ( @xmath102 ) which are still much lower than the astrophysical dynamos .",
    "if @xmath103 really has an inverse dependence on @xmath7 , then the solar dynamo should not be operating like it does !",
    "we may conclude that either we must have helicity fluxes out of the system or cross - equatorial diffusive fluxes inside the domain or that the @xmath58 equation to be used beside the mean - field induction equations must be suitably modified for @xmath1 dynamos . to verify",
