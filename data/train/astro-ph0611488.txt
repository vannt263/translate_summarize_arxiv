    "the main motivation of our modeling work is to contribute to building realistic prominence models . for this",
    ", we need an accurate knowledge of thermodynamic quantities ( temperature , densities ,  ) , level populations ( useful , e.g. , to infer the magnetic field properties from spectro - polarimetric observations ) , velocity fields , energy budget .",
    "however these quantities still have large uncertainties associated with them .",
    "observations of several different lines from different atoms / ions allow us in theory to measure these parameters . among these lines ,",
    "the h and he lines are important as they are strong and largely contribute to the radiative losses .",
    "however the prominence plasma being out of lte and optically thick in h and he resonance lines , the interpretation of line spectra or intensities in radially moving prominences is a non - trivial task .",
    "therefore , non - lte radiative transfer calculations including velocity fields are needed to build realistic prominence models . here",
    "we present such calculations and preliminary results .",
    "the prominence is represented by a 1d plane - parallel slab standing vertically above the solar surface .",
    "each prominence model is defined by a set of free parameters : the temperature @xmath0 , the gas pressure @xmath1 , the slab thickness @xmath2 ( or the total column mass ) , the height of the slab above the limb @xmath3 , the microturbulent velocity , and the radial speed . for this preliminary study",
    "we consider isothermal and isobaric prominences , although the code allows for inclusion of a transition region between the cold prominence and the hot corona .",
    "we first solve the pressure equilibrium , the ionization equilibrium , and the coupled statistical equilibrium ( se ) and radiative transfer ( rt ) equations for a 20 levels h atom .",
    "then the se and rt equations are solved for other elements : ( 29 levels ) and ( 4 levels ) , and ( 5 levels ) .",
    "more details on the modeling of the hydrogen , calcium , and helium spectra in quiescent prominences can be found in @xcite respectively , and references therein .    for the modeling of active and eruptive prominences",
    ", we use a velocity - dependent incident radiation as boundary conditions for the rt equations .",
    "it has already been shown by @xcite in the case of the hydrogen lines that the doppler effect induces a frequency shift of the incident profile relative to the rest case , and also a distortion of the incident profile due to the variation of the doppler shift with the direction of the incident radiation .",
    "it is also the case for the helium ( @xcite ) and calcium incident radiation .",
    "we reproduce the results of @xcite who computed the hydrogen radiation emitted by a radially moving prominence , using partial redistribution in frequency ( prd ) for the lyman lines .",
    "we obtain the same variation of the relative intensities ( intensities normalised to the line intensities when the prominence is at rest ) and the same line profiles for ly@xmath4 , ly@xmath5 , and h@xmath4 .",
    "the main result is that there exists an important coupling between ly@xmath5 and h@xmath4 which causes these lines to be first doppler brightened , and then doppler dimmed , with increasing velocity , while there is only a doppler dimming effect on ly@xmath4 .    figure  [ nl - fig : intensities ] presents relative intensities as a function of velocity for the 584 , 304 , and 10830  lines ( left panel ) and k and 8542  lines ( right panel ) at two different temperatures ( 8000k and 15000k ) .",
    "the 10830  line does not show any sensitivity to the doppler effect , which is mainly due to the very weak incident absorption line .",
    "the 584  line is quite sensitive to the doppler effect .",
    "its doppler dimming is more important at low temperature .",
    "the resonance lines are the most sensitive to the radial velocity of the plasma ( the relative intensity of the 256  line , not shown , exhibits a similar variation as 304 ) , and the doppler dimming is strong at the temperatures considered in this study .",
    "such a result was expected since the main mechanism of formation at these temperatures for these lines is the scattering of the incident radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that in this preliminary study we have not included a transition region between the cold prominence and the hot corona ( pctr ) .",
    "the presence of a hotter plasma in the pctr may somehow decrease the sensitivity of the resonance lines to the doppler effect as collisions will become more important in the formation processes of these lines .",
    "this will be investigated in a future work .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : intensities ] indicates that there is no strong doppler effect on the resonance lines , while we observe some doppler brightening of the 8542  line ( and indeed of the other two infrared lines at 8498 and 8662 , not shown ) at low temperature .",
    "if spectroscopic observations of erupting prominences are available , then a comparison between computed and observed line profiles can be made .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ nl - fig : profils he ] and [ nl - fig : profils ca ] the line profiles for the same helium and calcium lines considered in fig .  [",
    "nl - fig : intensities ] at two different temperatures ( solid line : 8000 k , dashed line : 15000 k ) , at four different velocities ( from top to bottom : 0 , 80 , 200 , and 400kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the doppler dimming effect is well observed in the helium resonance lines at 584  and 304  as the radial velocity is increased ( fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : profils he ] ) .",
    "we can observe asymmetries in the line profiles of these lines when the prominence plasma is moving radially , with some intensity enhancement which is especially visible in the red wing of the 584  line at low temperature .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "the radiation emitted by the disk center in our code is represented by symmetrical line profiles .",
    "when the prominence is at rest , the incident radiation illuminating the prominence slab is symmetrical ; however when the prominence plasma is moving radially the incident line profile becomes distorted and shifted towards the red . as we used the prd standard approximation in our calculations of the resonance lines of helium ,",
    "the resulting line profiles are asymmetrical .",
    "this would not have been the case if we had considered complete redistribution in frequency ( crd ) instead of prd .",
    "the line asymmetry is more visible for the 584  line as its wings are fairly bright , while the wing intensities of the 304line are low . despite the fact that the line asymmetry increases with speed for both lines , it is more visible at low speeds ( when the intensity in the wing is high enough ) . finally , it is more pronounced at low temperatures because the scattering of the incident radiation is relatively more important as compared to collisional processes than it is at higher temperatures .",
    "figure  [ nl - fig : profils ca ] shows that the intensities of the lines are lower at 15000k than at 8000k , an effect of to ionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "k ( solid line ) and @xmath7k ( dashed line ) , with @xmath8  dyn@xmath9 , and @xmath10  km , at different velocities : 0 , 80 , 200 , and 400kms@xmath6 from top to bottom .",

    "we show here how the non - lte radiative transfer calculations can help us to infer the thermodynamic properties of a prominence observed by the sumer spectrometer on soho .",
    "this prominence was actually a rather quiet prominence and we have not included any velocity fields in these calculations .",
    "it was observed during the 13th medoc campaign held at ias in june 2004 .",
    "we select a few pixels in the sumer slit which cut across the prominence and average the line profiles there .",
    "we consider the line profiles of two h resonance lines ( ly@xmath5 and ly@xmath12 ) and the resonance line at 584 . for the comparison between computed and observed line profiles",
    "we now include the presence of a pctr .",
    "the temperature variation between the cold prominence core and the corona suggested by @xcite has been adopted for this study . by a trial and error process we selected the temperature profile shown in fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : temp ] .",
    "the other prominence parameters are @xmath13  dyn@xmath9 , @xmath14  km ( total column mass 2.4@xmath15g@xmath9 ) , @xmath16  km , and the microturbulent velocity @xmath17  kms@xmath6 .",
    "we obtain a very good agreement between the computed profiles ( convoluted with the sumer instrumental profile ) and the observed profiles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : match ] .",
    "it is worth noting that fitting hydrogen _ and _ helium resonance lines simultaneously places strong constraints on the parameter space , and it was not possible to find another set of parameters for the prominence that would be significantly different than what is given above and that would lead to a satisfactory fit of the observed profiles .",

    "the non - lte radiative transfer modeling that we are developing is a key tool for interpreting observations and constructing realistic prominence models . the combination of lines from hydrogen , helium , and calcium , places strong constraints on the models .",
    "imaging and spectroscopy must be used for comparisons with calculations to determine thermodynamic parameters and velocities . the radial velocity determined from the comparison between observed and computed line profiles , in combination with line - of - sight velocities , should allow us to infer the full velocity vector of the prominence plasma . in a future work we will compare our model results with simultaneous observations of , e.g. , h@xmath4 and  304 ."
