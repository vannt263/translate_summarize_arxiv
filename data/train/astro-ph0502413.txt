    "in recent years , millimetre ( mm ) and sub - millimetre ( sub - mm ) bolometric cameras have become the focus of much effort .",
    "these instruments directly detect thermal emission associated with star formation and have proven useful in studying previously hidden processes in our own galaxy and others to very high redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , with its large aperture and excellent site ,",
    "has been particularly productive in this field .    even exploiting a combination of high , dry sites and ` windows ' in atmospheric opacity , emission due to the atmosphere and telescope s surroundings",
    "is very large compared to astrophysical signals @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is highly variable on time scales slower than a few hz . to counteract this",
    ", sub - mm telescopes can employ a variety of observing strategies to scan the sky rapidly and take differences to remove the bulk of the atmospheric emission .",
    "these techniques put astrophysical signals into an audio frequency band above the atmospheric 1/f knee .",
    "examples of specific observing strategies are those employed by sharc ii @xcite , which scans the sky in a lissajous pattern , and blast @xcite and act @xcite , which will scan the entire telescope in azimuth only .",
    "scuba uses a rapidly moving secondary mirror to chop the beam rapidly and nods the whole telescope more slowly @xcite while scuba2 ( which will also be deployed at the jcmt , @xcite ) intends to employ the dream algorithm @xcite . in all of these approaches",
    "the observation and data reduction processes which cancel atmospheric signals also filter astrophysical signals at large angular scales .    previous efforts to measure the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect on the jcmt have failed due to early removal of large angular scale signals during data reduction .",
    "therefore , as part of an effort to measure the sz effect with scuba @xcite , we have taken the unorthodox step of considering scuba data before subtracting data from adjacent nods .",
    "when we do this we find a repetitive signal which is orders of magnitude larger than typical astronomical and even atmospheric signals .",
    "[ fig : timestream ] shows an example of this signal .",
    "we will show that this signal is associated with changes in the orientation of the secondary mirror and presumably arises from altering the amount of thermal emission from the telescope which is received by the bolometer array .",
    "although this signal is present in all scuba data we have examined , it generally seems to be removed effectively in the standard surf @xcite reduction pipeline .",
    "however , a period during which nod subtraction does not effectively cancel this pick  up has already been identified by at least one author @xcite .",
    "this signal is synchronized with motion of the secondary mirror , and therefore occurs in the data at a set of audio frequencies overlapping those of astronomical signals .",
    "its presence imposes severe constraints on viable observation strategies and on the required precision of optical control at both the jcmt and similar telescopes . in this paper",
    "we present measurements and analysis of this signal with the aim of learning what these constraints are and determining the origin of this signal .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide excellent and extensive reviews of standard scuba operations and systematic effects .",
    "we review here just enough of the scuba observation modes to allow understanding of the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timestream ] .    the jcmt s beam is chopped on the sky by nutating the secondary mirror at about @xmath0hz in a nearly square wave pattern .",
    "the angular separation of the end points of this chop , called the _ chop throw _ , is chosen by the observer .",
    "the chop is symmetric about the optic axis of the telescope , which is to say that the two endpoints of the chop pattern are each displaced from the optic axis by half the chop throw .",
    "the measured difference in intensity between the two endpoints for every bolometer in both arrays is reported at approximately @xmath1hz .",
    "this signal is largely free of the _ uniform _ component of atmospheric emission .",
    "we will call this differential data the _ raw time series_.    the entire telescope is reoriented periodically to put one end of the chop pattern and then the other on to the nominal source position .",
    "this is called _ nodding _ the telescope .",
    "the difference in intensity between the two nod positions forms a triple difference on the sky : the brightness at the nominal source position minus that at two symmetrically located off - positions .",
    "this signal is largely free of the effects of _ gradients _ in atmospheric emission .",
    "this data set is called the _ de  nodded _ or _ double  differenced _ data , and is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : timestream ] .",
    "the scuba array under fills the focal plane , so the secondary mirror undergoes a slow , small amplitude walk in addition to the movements described above so that over time the sky is fully sampled .",
    "[ fig : jigglepattern ] shows the standard 64 point pattern , called a _",
    "jiggle pattern_. the 64 points are split into four quadrants of 16 pointings each and the telescope nods after observing each quadrant .",
    "if we label these quadrants 1 through 4 , and label the two nod positions as @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , the order of data collection is @xmath4 the pattern repeats every @xmath5 samples , requiring slightly longer than 128 seconds to complete one cycle .",
    "the sample series also has gaps in time because the primary mirror requires time to move .",
    "the order of observing nod @xmath2 and nod @xmath3 alternates by quadrant to minimize primary mirror motion .",
    "the peak to peak jiggle distance is about 30 arcsec , and the average jiggle distance from the middle of the pattern is about 9 arcsec . very similar , albeit simpler , motions occur in scuba s @xmath6 point jiggle pattern and 9 point photometry modes .",
    "although the scuba bolometers are sampled at @xmath7hz , data are reported as one second averages over the chop ; undifferenced data are not saved . in standard operation ,",
    "two time streams are reported , one for each nod position .",
    "normally , the nod time streams are subtracted from each other ( @xmath8 etc . ) , thereby removing a large component of the atmospheric emission and instrumental variation .",
    "this double  difference time stream , which consists of the target beam data minus half of each of the two chop positions data , is the standard scuba data product .",
    "the raw time series in fig .",
    "[ fig : timestream ] shows a clear periodicity at 128 samples , indicating emission is modulated by the 128 point jiggle - and - nod pattern .",
    "the peak to peak amplitude of the pick  up signal is about @xmath9mv , which is about @xmath10 times as large as those arising from the weakest astronomical sources scuba is capable of resolving . in order to provide a consistent , if approximate , guide by which to compare these signals to astrophysical sources and thermal effects we have adopted a gain of @xmath11jy / v throughout this paper",
    "this is consistent with the mean value observed in pre - upgrade scuba data @xcite . with this gain , the amplitude of the pick ",
    "up is about @xmath12jy per beam peak to peak .    in the de ",
    "nodded data set there are 16 points in the set @xmath8 , 16 in the set @xmath13 , and so on .",
    "these points are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : timestream ] . the amplitude of the pick  up signal has been dramatically reduced and these signals are consistent with a combination of detector and atmospheric noise .",
    "we conclude that the source of the pick ",
    "up is not modulated by nodding the telescope , and therefore that the pick  up signal is associated with motions of the secondary mirror only .    to check this conclusion , and to quantify the relation , we fit the raw time series to a polynomial in a secondary mirror orientation using elevation , @xmath14 , and azimuth , @xmath2 , coordinates as tracked by bolometer h7 s jiggle offsets , which are nominally zero on the optical axis of the telescope .",
    "this basis forms the natural coordinate system for exploring a signal which arises within or around the telescope .",
    "we perform a fit independently in @xmath14 and @xmath2 , using each angle and its derivatives .",
    "it is found that the fit does not require cross terms of @xmath2 and @xmath14 to describe the data .",
    "our fitting function is therefore @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the secondary mirror pointing at time @xmath17 measured in arcsec , dots denote time derivatives , and the constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined from the fit . in practice , these fits are performed independently to @xmath2 and then @xmath14 for each bolometer .",
    "the number of terms in the fit is arbitrary ; we have chosen @xmath24 as the ninth order terms are consistent with zero .",
    "if the signal is optical in origin , we expect the @xmath25 term , which corresponds to position , to dominate , while if it is due to pick  up from motors or electrical equipment , higher order terms",
    ", corresponding to velocities and accelerations , should dominate .",
    "any pick  up associated with the nod does not affect the time series at the jiggle frequencies , but rather adds a variable dc offset between the two nod positions . when eq .",
    "[ eqn : summands ] is fit , the linear terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are at least an order of magnitude larger than any other term . this fit is therefore consistent with optical pick  up alone ; the higher order terms ( @xmath28 ) are included in order to demonstrate that the pick  up pattern can be completely described in terms of the position of the secondary mirror .",
    "further , we find that the pick  up pattern is not constant but varies smoothly with bolometer position ( as shown below ) , which strongly suggests the pick  up is optical and not electrical in origin .",
    "residuals from this fit , @xmath29 , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : timestream ] . just like the de",
    " nodded data , these residuals also show nearly complete elimination of the pick  up signal . in a single data file this cancellation is effective to about one part in 100 ; unfortunately , to observe weak astrophysical signals in multiple integrations , we require cancellation to better than one part in 3000 .",
    "fourier transforms of the raw data , the de  nodded data , and the residuals from eq .",
    "[ eqn : summands ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffttime ] .",
    "caution is required when interpreting the transform of the de  nodded data since that data set is sampled differently in time than the other two sets .",
    "the raw data shows spikes at harmonics of @xmath30 .",
    "notice that the fourth harmonic has no amplitude above the continuum level .",
    "this is because the transitions from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , @xmath33 to @xmath34 , etc .",
    "occur at the fourth harmonic and nodding does not alter the secondary mirror pattern of motion .",
    "all of the harmonic spikes are missing from the power spectra of either the residuals or the de  nodded data .",
    "except at the spikes , the fit residuals match the raw data with high fidelity .",
    "notice that at very low frequencies the de  nodded data is a bit quieter than the residuals are .",
    "presumably noise and large angular scale astronomical signals which occur at low frequencies are removed from the data by nod subtraction .",
    "in order to understand the severity and prevalence of this signal , data were obtained from both the scuba archive , and a dedicated set of observations with very small chop throw in 2003 june .",
    "these data were chosen to reflect a sampling of the types of mapping observation commonly performed with scuba .",
    "we have examined data taken in both 16 point and 64 point jiggle patterns , as well as scuba s photometry mode which uses a small 9 point grid . a variety of chop throw angles between 3 and 180 arcsec have been chosen . in order to reduce possible contamination by astronomical sources , the data sets were selected based on low estimated target flux .",
    "an attempt was made to use only fields containing sources with fluxes less than @xmath35mjy , although this criterion was not met in the very small chop throw ( less than 15 arcsec ) data .",
    "a wide range of chop throws are chosen to give a wide sampling of possible scuba jiggle map configurations .",
    "also , data straddling the 1999 october scuba refit and upgrade are considered .",
    "all of the data were taken on photometric nights , @xmath36 . in all ,",
    "over 200 data files of varying lengths spanning nearly all of scuba s operational lifetime have been considered in this analysis .",
    "the data sets considered here have been preprocessed using surf",
    ". programs are called to flat field , de - spike and extinction correct both the double  differenced and single nod time streams ; we direct the reader to surf s documentation for the details of how these procedures are implemented .",
    "all of the data discussed here are left at this stage of processing ; advanced atmospheric removal has not been implemented .      for each bolometer in a given observation , the vector @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath38 denotes the different bolometers , is closely related to the gradient of @xmath39 in azimuth - elevation coordinates . because the linear terms dominate",
    ", @xmath40 captures almost all of the power in @xmath39 .",
    "the units of @xmath40 are v arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "when the vector field @xmath40 is plotted against the location of each bolometer in the focal plane , a clear pattern emerges ( figs .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] and [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "there is typically a null in the patterns and the magnitude of @xmath40 grows with separation from the location of the null in the focal plane .    in order to test",
    "whether this signal is only present in the long wavelength scuba array , the analysis discussed above is also performed on the short wavelength array ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] ) .",
    "it is found that the patterns are remarkably similar between arrays , and in particular the null in the pattern occurs at the same position in the two focal planes during any given observation .",
    "this implies that this signal originates somewhere in scuba s optical path .    the pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] is a derivative of the optical loading on each bolometer .",
    "there appears to be both a divergence and a curl in the pattern , perhaps because eq .",
    "[ eqn : summands ] does not employ true partial derivatives , or because the secondary mirror s orientation and a bolometer s location in the focal plane are not identically related . in any case",
    ", the location of the null in the pattern corresponds to the location of an extremum in the optical loading of the bolometer array .",
    "it is striking that in our experience this extremum does not occur at the array centre , which we presume is the symmetry axis of the telescope .",
    "however , since the telescope is very difficult to align to arcsec accuracy , it is not unreasonable to expect the symmetry axis to deviate from the array centre by a few tens of arcsec ( p.  friberg , private communication ) .    as a routine part of our sunyaev - zeldovich effect measurements ,",
    "an aluminum reflector was placed at the cryostat window and observations with large chop throw were performed .",
    "this eliminates all optical inputs to the bolometer arrays but leaves electrical pick  up from the various motors and acoustic pick ",
    "up intact . the resulting pattern is shown in fig .  [ fig:5 ] . the average amplitude of @xmath40 is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than without the reflector in place .",
    "the pick  up signal must be optical in origin .",
    "the correlated @xmath40 patterns occur in every scuba data set , and gross features such as the magnitude of the vectors are constant .",
    "however , details of each ` vector field ' , such as the centroid , curl , divergence , etc . , vary slowly in time . for instance , positional changes in the vector field centroid of tens of arcsec can be tracked over an evening of observation .",
    "furthermore , duplicate observations of the same field performed months apart result in patterns which are quite dissimilar .",
    "we believe that this is because a given field s altitude and azimuth have changed over the intervening time , even though in sky - based coordinates the field s position is constant .",
    "we have had difficulty locating data taken with precisely the same altitude , azimuth and chop throw separated by a suitable interval of time , but surmise that such data would produce very similar patterns if this is an optical pick ",
    "up related to ambient radiation in the telescope dome and its surroundings .",
    "careful analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] shows that the mean magnitude of the @xmath40 vectors , @xmath43 , is correlated with chop size .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 and its standard deviation as a function of chop throw are plotted in fig .  [ fig : opus ] for a sampling of data files with different chop throws .",
    "it is observed that the chop size and @xmath43 are correlated . while the characteristics of this correlation at modest or large chops are relatively well defined , the signal s behavior at very small chops is not so clear . in an attempt to clarify whether @xmath45 tends to zero at small chop throws , power laws with an offset",
    ", @xmath46 @xmath47 are fit to data collected with chop throws @xmath48 less than 30 arcsec .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined from the fit .",
    "the results from two of these fits , one with an offset of @xmath51v arcsec@xmath41 and the other with a voltage offset of @xmath52v arcsec@xmath41 ( this value being arbitrarily chosen for illustrative purposes ) are listed in table 1 and plotted in fig .  [ fig : opus ] .",
    "the @xmath53 statistics of these fits are essentially the same .",
    "although the two functions differ in principle , for chop throws of one arcsec the range allowed for the pick  up",
    "amplitude is small , from @xmath54 to @xmath55mjy per arcsec .",
    "even if the pick  up pattern tends to zero at @xmath56 , coherent mis  pointing during a jiggle observation by a few per cent of the jcmt s fwhm results in a spurious signal comparable to extra - galactic signals of interest .    .power law fit parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     interestingly , the power laws hold even for the large chop data , although using data at large chop is a poor way to constrain the characteristics of the signal at small chop ( this is the motivation for only using the smallest chop data in the fit ) .",
    "while the presence of an offset can not be ruled out by these data alone , we suspect that the relation is essentially linear and tends to zero at zero chop .",
    "finding an optical pick  up signal which depends upon the orientation of the secondary mirror is not a surprise .",
    "moving the secondary mirror alters the electromagnetic cavity formed by the primary and secondary mirrors of the telescope , and also alters the fraction of the beam which intercepts the telescope structure or misses the primary mirror . as has been pointed out , the pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] is a derivative of total optical loading on the bolometers .",
    "it is quite striking that the observed pattern sometimes corresponds to a minimum loading near to the optical axis , and sometimes to a maximum ( as in panels 1 and 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] ) .    to compare the observed signals to expectations based on a physical understanding of the telescope first",
    "requires conversion of the observations from jy per beam to an equivalent rayleigh  jeans ( rj ) temperature",
    ". the rj brightness of a source at @xmath57 m is @xmath58w m@xmath59 hz@xmath41 str@xmath41 k@xmath41 , and the solid angle of the jcmt s primary beam is @xmath60 str , so @xmath61 ideally , this conversion factor would be calculated as an integral over the scuba passband @xcite , which alters the numerical value by a few percent .",
    "the @xmath62jy peak - to - peak signal in fig .  [ fig : timestream ] corresponds to a @xmath63mk rj signal .",
    "a more useful number for understanding the emission mechanism is that the chop throw dependent emissivity coefficient @xmath64 for a typical chop throw of 60 arc seconds is @xmath65 given that the telescope temperature is typically @xmath66k , this corresponds to a variation in emissivity of @xmath67 per arcsec , averaged over the array .",
    "several mechanisms could plausibly give emissivity variations which are this high , and we do not know the scuba optical illumination pattern well enough to make a definitive distinction .",
    "it is certainly possible that several processes are comparable in magnitude .",
    "the aluminum reflective surfaces are a few per cent emissive .",
    "their apparent emissivity drops as the mirrors are tilted with respect to each other giving rise to a maximum emission on the optical axis and a variation which is to leading order quadratic in angle .",
    "this mechanism will not produce a minimum on axis .",
    "however , the measured signal is the difference between the gradients at two chop positions , and thus may have either sign depending on the order of the difference .",
    "the scuba plate scale is @xmath68 mm per arcsec ( p.  friberg , private communication ) so the illumination pattern on the primary moves many cm during routine operation , altering the fraction of the beam spilling off the edge of the mirror and terminating in the telescope enclosure . if @xmath69 is the fraction of the total scuba response in an annulus of width @xmath70 at the edge of the primary of diameter @xmath71 m , the anticipated signal from variations in beam spill is @xmath72 this requires @xmath73 per cent per mm , which is _ possible _ but larger than we expect .",
    "the secondary mirror support structure intercepts @xmath74 per cent of the beam ( p.  friberg , private communication ) .",
    "this coefficient could easily vary by one part in @xmath75 per arcsec , which would produce a signal at the observed level .",
    "we do not know whether this effect produces a maximum or a minimum near the optic axis . in any case",
    ", this very large optical signal is not a malfunction of the telescope , but an unavoidable consequence of employing an observing strategy in which the secondary mirror is moved .",
    "@xcite show that there is a spurious signal at a frequency near to 1 cycle per 16 samples present in scuba data collected during much of 2003 , and other groups agree ( a.  mortrier in preparation , t.  webb in preparation ) .",
    "published power spectra of this spurious signal look strikingly similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : ffttime ] given that the authors have not re - ordered their data to be in time - order before implementing a fourier transformation .",
    "we presume that either hardware or software difficulties during that period lead to imperfect nod cancellation , leaving a substantial portion of the secondary mirror - induced pick up signal present in the nominally cleaned data . as a check ,",
    "we have examined photometry data collected during the same period .",
    "in photometry mode , scuba executes a small nine - point grid to account for small errors which might occur in the absolute pointing of the telescope .",
    "if the excess noise discussed in @xcite is due to the secondary mirror and poor cancellation , there will be noise at one cycle per nine samples in photometry data . if the noise has a different origin it might well be at the same audio frequency in photometry mode as in jiggle mapping , i.e.  one cycle per 16 samples .",
    "[ fig : phot ] shows the power spectrum of a typical bolometer in the first set of photometry data from 2003 we have chosen to examine , and the excess power is clearly near to the frequency of secondary mirror motion for photometry .",
    "this broad band of excess noise is absent in data from either 1998 or 2000 which we examined .",
    "we conclude that the spurious signal from 2003 is in fact poor cancellation of secondary motion induced pick  up due to poor fine control of the secondary mirror s postion .",
    "this produces large residual signals in the double  differenced data streams . because the amplitude of the pick  up varies smoothly across the array ( e.g.  fig .  [ fig : patterns ] )",
    ", we have investigated the possibility of using the pattern as a template for removing the signal directly from the data streams .",
    "unfortunately , no bolometer data seem to exhibit a pick  up signal completely described by a gradient term , and it appears that it is not possible to construct a time series that is purely due to the pick  up from this template .    on a positive note , because this signal is bright and stable , it may be possible to use it to provide a short term gain monitor of very high signal to noise ratio in much the same way that @xcite use the total power response of their radiometers to obtain a short term gain monitor for _ wmap _ from the system temperature .",
    "however , a study of the stability of this signal and the reliability of its dependence on operating parameters is required to implement this strategy .    we do not know how large this effect is 4 arcmin off the optic axis where scuba2 intends to have some sensitivity , but we presume from fig .",
    "[ fig : opus ] that it is very large .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear how well this signal can be disentangled from the atmospheric signal without a chopper present in the system . at this point ,",
    "moving the secondary in any way seems to require nodding or some other symmetric differencing technique to remove the pick  up signal .",
    "unfortunately , the dream algorithm currently under consideration for use with scuba2 at the jcmt could well be affected by this signal .",
    "furthermore , instruments like thumper @xcite and bolocam @xcite , which may be deployed at the jcmt , will have to develop observation strategies which account for this type of pick  up .",
    "these are challenging issues which must be addressed before the next generation of instruments is deployed at the jcmt .",
    "the team who commissioned scuba and developed the observing modes and data reduction procedures deserve enormous credit for handling this large systematic effect in a way that so nearly removes if from the data .    many thanks to per friberg , colin borys , wayne holland , tim jenness , walter gear and craig walther for helpful discussions and advice .",
