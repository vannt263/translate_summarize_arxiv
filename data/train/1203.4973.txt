    "considerable effort has been dedicated to the investigation of the transport behavior of one - dimensional quantum wires .",
    "while it is accepted that the transport behavior of the electrons will be normal ( diffusive ) if the electrons are coupled to the phonons of the supporting lattice @xcite , there is a discussion on whether or not electron - electron interaction alone will render the transport diffusive , i.e. , non - ballistic . if the electrons are subject to a periodic potential , as implied by any standard tight binding model the total electron momentum is not necessarily conserved and one would expect diffusive transport . however , 1-d spinless fermionic models with nearest neighbor hopping and mutual interactions are accessible by a bethe ansatz , which means that very many local conserved quantities exist , thus they are called `` integrable '' @xcite . as follows from the mazur inequality",
    "the transport will be ballistic if there is a significant overlap of the current with any conserved quantity thus leading to a finite drude weight @xcite .",
    "such a finite drude weight has been found for zero temperature and small interactions ( gapless regime ) for all fillings @xcite .",
    "a finite drude weight has also been found for finite temperatures and all fillings but half filling @xcite .",
    "recently there have been papers arguing in both directions for half filling and finite temperature ( in the gapless regime ) : in favor of diffusive transport ( in spite of integrability)@xcite and in favor of ballistic transport @xcite .    furthermore , the question how transport behavior changes if integrability is continuously broken has been addressed . in the low temperature regime an argument based on bosonization shows that at least two non - commuting umklapp processes are required for non - ballistic transport @xcite . in all temperature regimes diffusion coefficients may scale as @xmath0 ( as opposed to @xmath1 ) with @xmath2 quantifying the integrability breaking term if the perturbation allows for the construction of new approximately conserved quantities @xcite .    in the paper at hand",
    "we investigate a 1-d model of spinless fermions with nearest neighbor hopping ( nn ) , next - nearest neighbor hopping ( nnn ) and a short ranged , perturbatively weak particle - particle interaction . in this model",
    "the nnn - term is the one that breaks integrability .",
    "we address transport behavior by ( approximately ) mapping the quantum dynamics onto a linear boltzmann equation via a projection operator technique @xcite . for simplicity",
    "all calculations are done at infinite temperature . within this framework",
    "we find concrete transport coefficients and evidence that they diverge as the nnn - term goes to zero .",
    "this suggests non - diffusive transport in the gapless regime at all temperatures .",
    "the time scales , however , at which this `` high - mobility '' behavior emerges become infinitely long",
    ". results from ( approximate ) projection techniques may be wrong if the projected subspace does not include all relevant slow hydrodynamic modes .",
    "as may be inferred from a paper by belitz @xcite , however , projective results may at least be viewed as reliable lower bounds to the transport coefficients .",
    "furthermore , in our projection we do not only keep , say , the particle and the energy current but all individual occupation numbers of momentum modes .",
    "in this paper we investigate 1-d models of weakly mutually interacting spinless fermions .",
    "i.e. , we consider fermions on a periodic 1-d crystal lattice .",
    "the total system consists of a hopping model , which describes the non - interacting fermions , and a nearest neighbor interaction term .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath3 \\ . \\label{hampos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the hopping term we incorporate nearest neighbor hopping determined by the parameter @xmath4 , according to a standard tight binding model , and also allow for some next - nearest neighbor hopping measured by the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to the interaction strength .",
    "@xmath7 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "one may diagonalize the non - interacting system via fourier transformation and arrives at    @xmath8    this hamiltonian describes an interacting quantum gas model with the dispersion relation of the non - interacting fermions @xmath9 and the interaction parameter @xmath10 .",
    "( the interaction of course obeys quasi momentum conservation with the quasi momentum transfer @xmath11 . ) for vanishing next - nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath9 corresponds to a cosine band , as usually obtained from a tight binding model .",
    "this model may describe , e.g. , weakly interacting electrons on some 1-d atomic wire , possibly deposited on some substrate , or , e.g. , as further discussed below , interacting spin systems , like for example an anisotropic spin 1/2 heisenberg chain ( by implementing some mapping of spins onto spinless fermions via jordan - wigner - transformation ) .",
    "in this section we investigate the transport behavior of the above introduced system by directly following a scheme described in @xcite .",
    "basically , this perturbative approach is composed of two steps .",
    "firstly , we map the underlying quantum dynamics of a certain set of `` occupation number deviations from equilibrium '' in momentum space onto some pertinent master equation , which may in some sense by interpreted as a scattering term of a corresponding linear(ized ) boltzmann equation .",
    "further information about the mapping of quantum dynamics onto boltzmann equations may be found in @xcite and references therein . in the approach at hand",
    "the number of variables of the master equation is determined by the ( finite ) number of lattice sites @xmath7 .",
    "the occupation number deviations from thermal equilibrium are described by operators @xmath13 where @xmath14 actually corresponds to the equilibrium fermi distribution .",
    "note that throughout this paper we focus on the case of infinite temperature , i.e. , in the following we assume @xmath15 .",
    "as dynamical variables we consider the time dependent expectation values of these operators , i.e. , @xmath16tr@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the density operator which describes the actual state of the system as resulting from the unitary schrdinger dynamics",
    ".    our approach is based on a pertinent projection operator technique ( for details see @xcite ) . within this framework",
    "one has to define a suitable projection operator , which maps the current system s state @xmath18 onto a density matrix - like object that only contains the variables of interest ( here @xmath19 ) as time dependent quantities . in this context",
    "the projection is chosen as @xmath20    the resulting master equation reads    @xmath21    where the corresponding rates ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are given by    @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}-\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{re}(w({l}-{i}))-\\text{re}(w({k}-{l})))^{2}\\ , \\frac{1}{n ^{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}\\cos [ \\frac{1}{\\hbar}(\\varepsilon_{{k}}+\\varepsilon_{{i}}-\\varepsilon_{{i+k - l}}-\\varepsilon_{{l}})\\tau ]   \\ .",
    "\\label{el - el}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    i.e. , every element of the rate matrix ( [ el - el ] ) is given by an integral over a certain correlation function .",
    "we especially intend to evaluate ( [ el - el ] ) in the limit of small interactions and large time @xmath25 .",
    "our approach to transport applies if all rates become constant in this limit for times larger than some correlation times @xmath26 .",
    "if this is the case , we may view the rate matrix @xmath27 as the collision term of a boltzmann equation from which a diffusion coefficient may be obtained using a type of chapman - enskog - like approach , see @xcite .",
    "we omit any details here for brevity .",
    "we find for the diffusion coefficient ( to the order of @xmath28 and for @xmath22 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inverse matrix to @xmath31 neglecting the eigenspace corresponding to the equilibrium distribution @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the momentum dependent velocity / current vector , the individual velocities are given by the slope of the dispersion relation of the non - interacting system @xmath34 .",
    "( hereby we follow the common idea of identifying particle velocities with group velocities . )",
    "although we consider finite lattices , the obtained diffusion coefficients have to be robust against upscaling of the system in terms of @xmath35 in order that our results are reasonable for large ( `` realistic '' ) crystals .",
    "for @xmath37 the analytical evaluation of the long time limit of the rates ( [ el - el ] ) is not directly accessible .",
    "instead we determine @xmath38 numerically for finite time @xmath25 .",
    "( numerics , which we omitted here , suggest that the rate matrix elements @xmath38 may be expected to become time independent after some correlation times @xmath26 . ) based on this time dependent rate matrix we may determine an initially also time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath39 by directly evaluating formula ( [ difco ] ) , which is our first main numerical result .",

    "[ dift ] demonstrates these time dependent diffusion coefficients for different next - nearest neighbor hoppings @xmath5 .",
    "one finds that for all analyzed @xmath5 the diffusion coefficients @xmath39 reach plateau levels and therefore become approximately time independent for large enough times .",
    "the constancy of @xmath47 of course indicates that the elements of the rate matrix @xmath48 have converged , too .",
    "i.e. , within this framework we are able to numerically determine finite long time diffusion coefficients for non - vanishing next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath49 .",
    "we essentially find the following two quantitative results .",
    "the long time diffusion coefficients become larger for smaller @xmath5 .",
    "this finding clearly demonstrates the quantum nature of the model and the approach , because it seems counter - intuitive in the sense that it does not fit the ( classical ) perspective that an increased hopping would lead to a higher diffusion .    .",
    "the numerics ( points ) are well approximated by the function @xmath50 ( solid line ) .",
    "@xmath51 diverges for @xmath12.,width=241 ]    additionally , fig .",
    "[ difb ] shows the dependence of the long time diffusion coefficients on the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath5 .",
    "the plot suggests a dependence @xmath52 ( , although we do not have an analytical proof for this type of relation ) , which would mean that the diffusion coefficient diverges for @xmath12 .",
    "secondly , the time , after which the diffusion coefficient is approximately constant , becomes larger for smaller @xmath5 .",
    "i.e. , to analyze the interesting limit @xmath53 ( see below ) we have to evaluate longer and longer times to obtain the plateau level ( , which goes along with larger chain lengths @xmath7 ; recall that the results should be robust against upscaling of @xmath7 ) .",
    "since for @xmath12 the plateau is reached only at infinite times and the plateau height is expected to be infinite , which is in some sense equivalent , we can not numerically extract finite diffusion coefficients in this case .",
    "the findings may rather suggest that the transport is possibly non - diffusive for @xmath12 .",
    "some analytical treatment of this case can be found below in sec .",
    "[ sec - analytics ] .    at this point",
    "this result should be compared to a recent , related result by steinigeweg et al .",
    "they consider the same model class but only for @xmath12 and employ a related projection technique .",
    "however , other than in the work at hand , they do not keep all individual momentum occupation numbers but project onto a single variable , namely the current @xmath54 .",
    "doing so they find a finite diffusion coefficient emerging at short time scales for all @xmath6 including arbitrarily small ones .",
    "we checked that this scenario gradually transforms into the picture we find as more and more observables in addition to the current are kept in the projection , i.e. , time scales become longer and diffusion constants increase . this , however , is , according to belitz @xcite , not a contradiction since results from projections onto subsets of observables yield reliable lower bounds to the true transport coefficients .",
    "thus we conclude , in spite of the findings by steinigeweg et al . that there is no regular diffusive transport for @xmath12 .    concerning the short time / strong interaction behavior of the diffusion coefficients we find that the graphs for different @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ dift ] intersect at some time @xmath25 .",
    "it may be thinkable that the behavior of the diffusion coefficients reverses for small times in the way that the diffusion coefficient for small times becomes larger for larger @xmath5 , which would be in agreement with ( or at least not contradictory to ) the above mentioned intuitive expectation .",
    "however , since in our approach the rate matrix is not converged out at those times , we can not assure that the short time values are quantitatively correct , they rather serve as an indicator for the overall qualitative behavior . for",
    "this regime also see @xcite .",
    "the special case of vanishing next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath12 is of particular interest because the regarded model of spinless fermions ( [ ham ] ) is effectively equivalent to an anisotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg chain .",
    "the corresponding spin hamiltonian    @xmath56 + \\delta \\ , s^{z}_{n } s^{z}_{n+1}\\big]\\ ] ]    may be transformed into the hamiltonian ( [ hampos ] ) with @xmath12 via a suitable jordan - wigner - transformation .",
    "note that we consider here the case of small @xmath6 , which rather corresponds to the case of strong anisotropy in the spin picture .",
    "recall that in our numerical evaluation in sec .",
    "[ sec - numerics ] we have found diverging long time diffusion coefficients for @xmath12 which we suggested to interpret as an indicator for possibly non - diffusive transport . if this is actually the case , one would expect to find a number of conserved quantities , at least some of which should have a significant overlap with the current .",
    "( since the model is integrable if ( and only if ) @xmath12 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - introduction ] ) , there are a large number of conserved quantities for @xmath12 . the transition from non - integrability to integrability may here be related to the transition from diffusive to non - diffusive transport . )    for @xmath12 one may analytically determine the rates @xmath48 in the limit @xmath57 . assuming that the momentum modes are lying densely in @xmath58-space ( i.e. , assuming long chains , ) one may substitute the sum over @xmath59 in ( [ el - el ] ) by a corresponding integral , i.e. , @xmath60 and regard the energy terms @xmath61 in the first and @xmath62 in the second part of the sum as continuous functions of @xmath59 .",
    "routinely exploiting the properties of the @xmath63-function one may carry out the time integration in ( [ el - el ] ) and finds that in the limit @xmath57 only the exactly energy conserving scattering processes contribute , i.e. , only addends featuring ( @xmath64 ) in the first and ( @xmath65 ) in the second term .    the second `` minus '' term yields diverging @xmath66-like contributions on lines , with respect to a graphical illustration of the scattering operator , defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but only exactly on those lines .",
    "for all other @xmath69 , even in the direct vicinity of those lines , the `` minus '' term vanishes , i.e. , the corresponding contribution to the rate matrix from the second term may be written as @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "this feature may be illustrated by a finite time sketch of the total rate matrix @xmath72 ( without diagonal elements ) ( see fig . [ rmat ] ) .",
    "one finds large negative matrix elements in the vicinity of the above mentioned lines , for larger @xmath25 the negative contributions move closer to the lines , which eventually leads to the @xmath66-like structure .     for @xmath12 without diagonal elements ,",
    "the labels denote the corresponding momentum mode numbers .",
    "there are large ( absolute ) negative scattering matrix elements ( here black ) between modes near lines with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which originate from the `` minus '' term in [ el - el ] .",
    "parameters : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath22.,width=264 ]    although these terms are problematic for the determination of the complete rate matrix , they yield no contribution to the diffusion coefficient ( [ difco ] ) because of symmetry arguments ( see below ) and may therefore be omitted in the transport investigations addressed in this paper .    the complete rate matrix for @xmath12 features mirror symmetry to the band middles , i.e. , lines with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , because the @xmath78-function simply passes into its negative under inversion on those lines .",
    "that is , every eigenvector of the rate matrix has to transform into itself or its negative under mirror imaging on those lines and the eigenvectors may accordingly be classified by , say @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the matrix therefore separates into these symmetry subspaces , i.e. , if one chooses a matrix representation where all basis vectors feature either @xmath79 or @xmath80 symmetry , there is no coupling between the two subspaces , the corresponding matrix elements have to vanish .",
    "note that the current features @xmath79 symmetry . for any @xmath79 vector @xmath81",
    "one finds that @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "that is , the multiplication of the `` minus '' part @xmath86 with a @xmath79 vector @xmath87 is equal to @xmath88 , since two terms cancel each other , depending on whether @xmath89 is positive or negative , and the remaining term does not contribute to the integration because the corresponding @xmath58-argument is not in the first brillouin zone .",
    "therefore @xmath86 gives no contribution to the sum evaluated in ( [ difco ] ) , which means that @xmath86 can be neglected .    from the remaining first `` plus '' term in ( [ el - el ] )",
    "one finally obtains from collecting and evaluating all the zeros of the respective argument in ( [ el - el ] ) @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "one recognizes that the rate matrix @xmath92 is here a markedly complicated object , mainly because of two reasons .",
    "there are diverging elements of @xmath92 in the vicinity of lines defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for larger and larger systems ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "when the momentum modes become denser and denser in @xmath58-space , there are more and more elements in the direct vicinity of those lines , which therefore become arbitrarily large . from this",
    "one may expect that at least some eigenvalues of @xmath92 diverge in the limit @xmath93 .    secondly , there are whole lines in the matrix ( [ rateinf ] ) defined by @xmath94 and @xmath95 where all matrix elements are @xmath88 , indicating conserved quantities .",
    "i.e. , @xmath96 is a conserved quantity , which features a non - singular but finite overlap with the current .",
    "this causes an infinitely small portion of the current to decay infinitely slowly ( see fig.[ewpl ] . ) in @xcite it is pointed out that a non - diffusive behavior of the system would require a non - local conservation law .",
    "note , however , that the above conserved quantity features such a spatially non - local structure .    to take a closer look at the concrete transport behavior we evaluate the overlap of the current / velocity vector with the eigenvectors of @xmath92 in dependence of the corresponding eigenvalues .     of the current @xmath97 with the eigenvectors @xmath98 of the matrix @xmath92 versus corresponding `` rescaled '' eigenvalue ( @xmath99 are eigenvalues of @xmath92 ) for time @xmath57 .",
    "there is a finite overlap with ( approximately ) conserved quantities for @xmath100 , i.e. , parts of the current decay arbitrarily slowly .",
    "parameters : @xmath101 , @xmath74 , @xmath22.,width=241 ]    firstly , fig.[ewpl ] shows that the current does not decay monoexponentially , although an average relaxation rate may be identified .",
    "in particular there is a finite overlap between the current and conserved ( arbitrarily slowly relaxing ) quantities , i.e. , an infinitely small portion of the current does not decay at all .",
    "this can explain why we are not able to find converging diffusion coefficients according to formula ( [ difco ] ) and why the numerically calculated curve @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "[ dift ] ) does not exhibit a plateau for @xmath12 .",
    "fig.[ewpl ] also demonstrates that there are many quantities which have no overlap with the current .    within the scope of the master equation dynamics ( [ mastereq ] ) the current autocorrelation function @xmath102 decays multiexponentially",
    ", i.e. , @xmath103 where @xmath99 are eigenvalues of the rate matrix @xmath92 ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 corresponds to the overlap of the current vector with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath98 of @xmath92 defined by @xmath106 . for large systems one may substitute the sum by an integral @xmath107 with continuous eigenvalues @xmath108 and the function @xmath109 essentially given by fig .",
    "the long time behavior is mainly determined by the regime of small @xmath110 .",
    "therefore we approximate @xmath109 by the corresponding taylor expansion around @xmath111 @xmath112 with some coefficients @xmath113 . inserting ( [ ptaylor ] ) into ( [ cint ] )",
    "one finds that for times @xmath25 larger than @xmath114 the behavior of @xmath115 is dominated by the term @xmath116 which results from the zeroth order term of ( [ ptaylor ] ) . all other contributions decay with @xmath117 or higher orders in @xmath25 or exponentially with @xmath25 .",
    "although @xmath115 is essentially a sum of exponential functions , it does not behave exponentially in this limit .",
    "a time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath39 , which may be decomposed as @xmath118 is dominated by the second term for times larger than @xmath114 . in this limit @xmath39 behaves logarithmic as @xmath119 and consequently does not become constant for @xmath57 .",
    "also note that the integral over the current - autocorrelation function as , e.g. , given in ( [ difint ] ) is directly related to the time dependent growth of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of some initial distribution , the corresponding connection has been established in @xcite .    within the scope of our approach the result ( [ diflog ] ) would lead to the conclusion that the transport is not regularly diffusive and neither really ballistic ( in this case one would find @xmath120 ) , but rather something in between , which may , e.g. , be termed `` anomalous diffusion '' ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "this characteristic behavior arises from the fact that the function @xmath109 ( cf .",
    "[ ewpl ] ) exhibits a finite value at @xmath121 .",
    "ballistic transport would require a peak at @xmath121 . from ( [ diflog ] )",
    "one may suspect that the msd would grow proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "however , our approach is restricted to diffusion coefficients of the order of @xmath123 , i.e. , there could possibly be diffusive behavior scaling with @xmath124 or higher orders .",
    "we demonstrated that the quantum dynamics of momentum mode occupation numbers in a 1-d quantum model for weakly interacting fermions may be mapped onto a master equation , the corresponding rate matrix can serve as collision term of a linear(ized ) boltzmann equation .",
    "we numerically found that adequately calculated diffusion coefficients become constant in the limit of large times and large systems for finite next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "these long time diffusion coefficients are larger for smaller next - nearest neighbor hopping . for vanishing next - nearest neighbor hopping",
    "the diffusion coefficients diverge . in this case",
    "we have analytically shown that arbitrarily small parts of the current do not relax because there is a finite overlap between the current and ( approximately ) conserved quantities .",
    "this result suggests anomalous diffusive transport behavior for the model featuring no next - nearest neighbor hopping ."
