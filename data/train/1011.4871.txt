    "the dilaton is an essential ingredient of superstring theory , and constitutes a scalar field partner of the graviton @xcite .",
    "therefore , the background fields associated with the vacuum state of superstring theory should involve this field in common with the metric in the basic action .",
    "this is referred to as dilaton gravity @xcite . to the lowest level of approximation",
    "the dilaton is a free and massless scalar field with a special kind of coupling to the matter fields . as a consequence of this coupling , a time varying dilaton field determines time - dependent coupling constants . in order to overcome this difficulty the dilaton should remain constant during the present stage of evolution of the universe . moreover ,",
    "unless the dilaton turns out to be very massive , its existence could lead to an observable `` fifth force '' similar to the ones which are currently associated to the observations of the dark matter .",
    "the constraints posed by current experimental observations determine the lower bound on the mass of the dilaton to be of the order @xmath0 @xcite ( but see @xcite for an attempt to make a running dilaton consistent with late time cosmology ) .",
    "the dilaton stabilization problem has been at the center of an intense research activity in recent times because of its physical relevance .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dilaton is one of various scalar fields appearing in the formulation of superstring theory in the low - energy limit .",
    "the sizes and shapes of the extra spatial dimensions associated with superstring theory are also leading to additional scalar fields , called `` moduli fields '' .",
    "the stabilization of such moduli fields has been the object of recent attention particularly in connection with type iib superstring theory .",
    "the introduction of fluxes within the compactification spaces has made it possible to stabilize various moduli fields @xcite .",
    "also , gaugino condensation @xcite has been employed to stabilize the dilaton field in the context of heterotic superstring theory @xcite and in string gas cosmology @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that , since dilaton stabilization has special relevance for late time cosmology , there is motivation for finding mechanisms which do not directly rest on the concrete assumptions defining the nature of the extra dimensions .",
    "an additional motivation to search for alternative dilaton stabilization mechanisms comes from string gas cosmology ( sgc ) .",
    "the sgc @xcite is a model of early universe cosmology which employs new degrees of freedom and symmetries of string theory , and couples these elements with gravity and dilaton fields into a classical action background model .",
    "the universe is considered to start as a compact space containing a gas of strings . since in string theory there is a maximal temperature for a gas of closed strings , the initial state of the cosmological evolution in sgc will be a phase of almost constant temperature , the so called `` hagedorn phase '' .",
    "the sgc is able to define a non - singular cosmology in which there is no starting big bang explosion .",
    "it has been noted that the thermal fluctuations in a gas of closed strings in the hagedorn phase can justify the scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations observed in nature @xcite , with a particular prediction of a slight blue tilt for gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency of the picture requires that the dilaton field be fixed during the hagedorn phase .",
    "therefore , in the sgc theory the dilaton needs to be fixed at very early times and at very late times .",
    "thus , clarifying the mechanisms of dilaton field stabilization is an important question in particle physics today .",
    "it is worth noting that the universal type of coupling of the dilaton to the matter fields not only leads to an unwanted effect as the time - dependence of the coupling constants but it also furnishes the possibility that quantum effects due to the interaction of the dilaton with matter might generate interesting contributions to the effective potential of the dilaton .    in a previous work published in ref .",
    "@xcite , we started to explore this question .",
    "the work considered the cosmological periods when the additional spatial dimensions of superstring theory were already stabilized and the study was done in the framework of a four - dimensional field theory .",
    "the objective of study was then the interaction of the dilaton with massive fermions .",
    "such masses can be defined by fluxes about internal manifolds . in late time cosmology",
    ", the masses could had been generated after supersymmetry breaking . in an alternative",
    "early universe cosmology , one may consider thermally generated fermion masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was considered a simple form for the dilaton gravity action in which a massive dirac fermion term was added @xcite .",
    "the action was chosen in the einstein frame , which does not show any dilaton field dependence in the kinetic terms for the fermions .",
    "on the other hand , the fermion mass becomes a function of the dilaton , involving a universal exponential factor in dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "the chosen action described the low energy effective interaction of super - yang - mills fermions with the dilaton field in superstring theory @xcite .",
    "the effective potential for the dilaton field was evaluated up to two loop corrections in the small dilaton radiative quantum field limit .",
    "that leads to a yukawa like interaction term which allows standard qft calculations .",
    "a fixed value of the cosmological scale factor was assumed .",
    "the outcome of the work was , thanks to the appearing of logarithms in the loop calculations , that the dilaton field appeared in the result in powers multiplied by the exponential factors of the field .",
    "this structure , in the one loop approximation clearly indicated the spontaneous generation of vacuum mean value of the dilaton field .",
    "motivated by the dynamical generation of the dilaton result in ref .",
    "@xcite , we here will address the evaluation of next corrections 3-loop terms to the 2-loop evaluation of the effective potential for the dilaton field .",
    "the main issue to be  explored is the possibility of the appearance in the improved potential  of the stabilizing effect which were in fact absent in the second order correction , and which are suspected to be created by the existence of massive matter upon the mean value of the dilaton .",
    "the results obtained , at least indicate , for the fermion mass being selected at the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 quark mass scales , that the mean value of the dilaton field tends to be stabilized at a high value being close to the planck mass or the @xmath1 scale , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the appearance of mass for matter in the course of the evolution of the universe can generate a stabilizing action on the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton field making it unobservable .",
    "this effect will tend to stop the time evolution of the mean value , as it is convenient for string theory consistency .",
    "the work also present an study of the validity of the linear approximation of the dilaton exponential factor which leads to the simpler effective yukawa theory employed .",
    "it follows that for the two values of the large fermion masses assumed ( the top quark and gut scale ones ) the approximation should work well , after assuming that the low energy effective effective action of string theory is the bare one in the renormalization of the model .",
    "a brief resume about the procedure employed to estimate the dilaton mass is also given .",
    "we can point out , that in the process extending the work to include higher loop corrections , we have noticed that in ref.@xcite the kinetic term of the dilaton lagrangian was chosen with a negative sign .",
    "this selection , although not changing the one loop correction , led to a sign change of the 2-loop terms , which suggested the existence of minima in the effective action argued in ref .",
    "however , in spite of this non physical adopted assumption in that work , the indication about the dynamical generation in ref.@xcite remained a valid one , because the change in the metric did not affected the one - loop correction , the basic quantity indicating the dynamical generation effect .",
    "the present work corrects the result for the two loop terms , and indicates that its place in the stabilizing effect over the dilaton field is played by higher order contributions .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : in section ii , the notation and basic formulation are given .",
    "section iii presents the elements of the three loops evaluation of the effective potential .",
    "section iv  discuss the results of the calculation .  in section",
    "v the results are resumed and commented . finally , appendix a presents the investigation of the yukawa model approximation and the review on the scheme for evaluating the generated dilaton mass .",
    "let us consider a model of the dilaton field interacting with fermion matter in the form @xmath3 that is , we are considering  the dilaton field  interacting with a massive fermion in the einstein frame , in which the metric @xmath4 has been approximated by the minkowski metric in order to simplify the evaluation .",
    "the gravitational constant is here explicitly introduced , and natural units are employed for the distances and mass . the vacuum value of the dilaton field is named as @xmath5 and its radiative part is called @xmath6 note that we are assuming the radiative part is small in order to retain only the first term in the  expansion of the exponential .",
    "this is the yukawa approximation which is here employed . in appendix",
    "a it is argued that it can be a a good approximation for the two values of the large fermion masses considered here : the top quark mass and a gut scale one , assumed that the the ratio between the fermion mass and the planck one is very much smaller than one .",

    "the field value at the minima grow when the coupling tends to vanish .",
    "it can be noted , that the non bounded from below  character of the approximated potential calculated here is determined by the fact that the quintic power of @xmath116 correction turns to be negative .",

    "thus , it can be expected that for a maximal fermion mass in nature ranging between the lower bound @xmath165 and the  @xmath1 scale one , the  dilaton gets stabilized at a large field value as required by string phenomenology .",
    "in addition the resulting values of its mass , for the same range of @xmath142 masses , is also out of the current observability range of particle detectors .",
    "the predictions for the dilaton stabilization problem determined the existence of massive fermion matter had been further investigated here .",

    "the results indicate that the dilaton mean field becomes stabilized at the very high values required by its role in allowing gravity to have its observed properties .",
    "then , the same existence of matter seems to be a possible source of the dynamical fixation of the dilaton field at the high values , required by string theory to imply the observable einstein theory of gravity .",
    "furthermore , the evaluations indicate that the dilaton field is also found to be strongly bound around its mean value , by showing a large mass being close to the @xmath1 or planck scales .",
    "therefore , the work identifies a possible explanation for the lack of observable consequences of the dilaton scalar field in nature .",
    "the discussion included  contributions to the effective potential up to 3-loops .",
    "this allows to consider the influence of the inclusion of different leading perturbative correction on the main conclusions .",
    "after , disregarding in the evaluated potential : a ) the highest order term ( quintic ) in the expansion in powers of @xmath167 ( which determined the unbounded from below structure of the potential at large @xmath116  values )  or b ) the two highest orders ( the quintic and the quartic ones ) , the obtained modified potentials are both bounded from below at high field values .",
    "this procedure allows that minima as functions of @xmath116 exist for arbitrarily small values of  the coupling @xmath117 .",
    "this allows to evaluate the small coupling values associated to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark masses .",
    "the fact that the yukawa theory under consideration should exhibit a bounded from below potential , then supports this here adopted procedure for  estimating the  vacuum mean values and mass of the dilaton field",
    ". however , further higher loop evaluations are convenient to define more precise estimated values of the dilaton vacuum field and mass and also for checking that they do not affect the picture .",
    "the validity of the employed yukawa like approximation in which the power expansion in dilaton field of exponential factor of the fermion mass is limited to the linear term in the field , is argued when the fermion mass is very much smaller than plank mass .",

    "let us study the validity of only retaining the linear term in the expansion of the exponential of the dilaton field multiplying the fermion mass in the action .",
    "for this purpose let us consider the mean value of the square of the radiation field  @xmath168 times the dilaton coupling @xmath169 in the just considered yukawa model .",
    "the square root of this quantity gives a measure of the amount of the quantum fluctuations of @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "a resulting small value of this quantity justifies the approximation done in the work . in terms of the dilaton green function @xmath33",
    "this quantity can be written as follows:@xmath171 where @xmath172 is its selfenergy which will be evaluated in the one loop approximation , by excluding the divergent pole parts .",
    "this corresponds to using the ms substraction by also employing the feynman expansion in terms of the renormalized fields incorporating counterterms .",
    "let us now consider that the bare dilaton theory being quantized , is valid in the planck scale where its action is assumed to define a low energy physics for a string theory .",
    "then , after denoting with the b subindex the bare quantities , the relations between the bare and renormalized magnitudes are @xmath173    we will also assume that the product @xmath174 , after the study of the renormalization properties of the theory , can be chosen as a renormalization group invariant , which determines for the renormalization constants the relation @xmath175      now , in order to get an estimate of this quantity , let us consider the approximation in which the renormalized yukawa coupling is small and also assume that the finite part of the one loop selfenergy is evaluated at zero momentum .",
    "as it will be seen in the comment of the next point , this quantity determines the first approximation for the dilaton mass as given by the square root of the value of @xmath177 fixing the pole of the propagator .",
    "as it was mentioned , in the discussion of the next point , assuming that the coupling is small implies that the selfenergy evaluated at zero momentum approximately determines the pole mass of the dilaton .",
    "thus in this small coupling limit at least the above described approximation can give a reasonable estimate of the field fluctuations .",
    "in addition , as it was supposed in the work , we will fix the scale parameter @xmath178 as coinciding with the fermion mass , that is @xmath179 therefore , approximating @xmath180 by @xmath181 and evaluating the remaining simple momentum integral gives@xmath182    in order to proceed , let us evaluate the wavefunction renormalization constant @xmath183 to further transform the previous formula . the fermion one loop contribution without the substractions",

    "this permits to define the  wave function renormalization constant and the coefficient of the mass counterterm as the pole part in @xmath49 of the fermion loop contribution .",
    "the wavefunction renormalization constant is given as @xmath188      this result indicates that the mean squared deviation of the argument of the exponential of the dilaton radiation field is of the order of the square of ratio between the mass of the fermion and the planck mass .",
    "therefore , for the values considered in the work : the top quark mass and the gut unification scale , the exponential interaction term in the dilaton radiation field should be well approximated by the linear term defining the yukawa model .      in this subsection",

    "this property implies that the results in the work indicate the stabilization of the dilaton vev due to the quantum corrections associated to massive matter fields .    lets us consider now the question of the approximation in which the results determine an estimation of the mass for the oscillation around the mean field .",
    "the discussion in the previous subsection partially helps to clarify this point .",
    "the masses of the particles are defined by the squared momenta making equal to zero the inverse propagator @xmath198 where , since @xmath185 is finite , @xmath94 has been substituted .",
    "the approximation which is employed to estimate the dilaton mass in the work is obtained by expanding the proper mass ( the squared momentum value )  which makes vanish the inverse propagator , in powers of the coupling constant @xmath199 as follows @xmath200 after substituting this series in the inverse propagator , and noting that the inverse propagator for the scalar field is a function of the momentum only through its squared values and that the coupling expansion of the one loop selfenergy @xmath185 is already of order @xmath201 , it follows @xmath202    therefore , in the first approximation , the proper mass is given by the squared root of the zero momentum component of the selfenergy .",
    "further , the selfenergy at zero momentum coincides with the squared root for the second derivative of the effective potential , and this was the criterion employed to evaluate the dilaton mass in the work .",
    "this property , can be seen after expressing the effective action expanded around an assumed minimum and homogeneous field value as follows@xmath193 &   = \\gamma\\lbrack\\phi(x)]-\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int dxdy\\varphi(x)d^{-1}(x - y)\\varphi(y)+ ... \\nonumber\\\\ &   = -v^{(4)}v[\\phi]-\\frac{v^{(4)}\\varphi^{2}}{2}\\int\\int dzd^{-1}(z)+ ... \\nonumber\\\\ &   = -v^{(4)}v[\\phi]-\\frac{v^{(4)}\\varphi^{2}}{2}[d^{-1}(p)]_{p=0}+ ...",
