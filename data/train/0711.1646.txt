    "<S> we propose a new scheme for realizing nonlocal nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier by means of genuine four - mode entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier is regarded as a unitary transformation from two input fields to two outputs . </S>",
    "<S> two inputs and two outputs are located at the remote stations respectively . employing off - line four - mode entanglement , homodyne detection , classical communication and local displacement , </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme can be implemented with a setup that is experimentally accessible at present .    </S>",
    "<S> the nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) can be described with the following input - output unitary transformation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the annihilation bosonic operators of the input and output signal ( idler ) fields respectively , and @xmath3 is the power gain . usually nopa is closely related to phase - insensitive amplification , which only involves eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pia1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum state @xmath4 is amplified by an amount @xmath5 , and at the same time an additive noise @xmath6 must be attached to maintain commutation relation @xmath7=1)$ ] of the amplifier output . </S>",
    "<S> this ultimate limits imposed by quantum mechanics were addressed long years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic noise , intimately linked with measurement theory and the no - cloning theorem , gives rise to many inextricable restrictions on the manipulations of quantum states . despite these limitations , </S>",
    "<S> the phase - insensitive amplifier is rich of application , in particular , in optical communication . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , nopa is of particular importance for quantum information and communication , for example the generation of two - mode gaussian entangled state ( einstein - podolskyo - rosen ( epr ) entangled state ) @xcite , and quantum cloning @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous apparatuses can be used for accomplishing the phase - insensitive amplification , for instance , solid state laser amplifiers @xcite , and the schemes based on the linear optics and feedforward @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the idler output in these schemes is not always accessible , e.g. , in a laser amplifier this mode is scattered into vibrational modes of atoms . although nopa can be achieved directly by type - ii parametric interaction @xcite , there is a lot of technic trouble in the implementation process for coupling efficiently , mediated by a nonlinearity , the input signal and idler fields into the pump field . </S>",
    "<S> we define this type of nopa as the local nopa since the two input and two output fields are at a same location . </S>",
    "<S> the localization limits its application in quantum information and communication . </S>",
    "<S> a recent trend in quantum information science is that the nonlinear interaction are efficiently replaced by off - line entanglement , classical communication , and local operation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol of substituting the in - line parametric amplifier with linear optics , feedforward and an off - line epr source has been suggested @xcite , such that the trouble to couple the input signal and idler fields with the pump field in a nonlinear crystal can be overcome . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite local nopa and quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) interaction based on off - line squeezers , linear optics , and measurements is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> recently , implementing nonlocal interaction between spatially distant quantum network nodes becomes very interesting work . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal qnd interaction can be implemented @xcite by using off - line four - mode cluster state @xcite , which is the genuine multipartite entanglement . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that nopa can be achieved nonlocally by using off - line four - mode entanglement , homodyne detection , classical communication and local displacement to replace the in - line nonlinear interaction . in the proposed system , </S>",
    "<S> all two inputs and two outputs locate four remote stations respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the used off - line four - mode entanglement is a new class of genuine multipartite entangled states , which is different from greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and cluster states and can be generated by combining two beams from two different pairs of epr entangled beams on a beam splitter .    </S>",
    "<S> first we must prepare a four - mode entangled state and distribute them to four remote stations . as shown in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , two pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 of epr entangled states are utilized to generate the genuine four - mode entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the epr entangled beams have the very strong correlation property , such as both their sum - amplitude quadrature variance @xmath10 , and their difference - phase quadrature variance @xmath11 , are less than the quantum noise limit , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the squeezing factor , and , @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the amplitude and phase quadrature of optical field with the canonical commutation relation @xmath16=2i$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> one of the epr entangled beams ( @xmath17 ) is combined with one of the other epr pair ( @xmath18 ) on a beam splitter @xmath19 with reflectivity rate @xmath20 and transmission rate @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the output fields are expressed by @xmath22 so , the four - mode entangled state for nonlocal nopa is described with the annihilation operator @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the four - mode entangled state for nonlocal nopa will be discussed in the following by its quantum correlation variances of the amplitude and phase quadratures ( position and momentum ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum correlations of the four - mode entangled state for nonlocal nopa can be obtained easily with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where snl is the shot noise limit . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly shows that this state exhibits the full inseparability ( genuine four - party entanglement ) according to the criteria of detecting genuine multipartite cv entanglement @xcite . in each of above inequalities , the position and momentum correlation variance involves three - party combination from the four entangled modes . </S>",
    "<S> now we compare continuous variables ( cv ) four - mode cluster state @xcite and ghz state with the four - mode entangled state for nonlocal nopa . </S>",
    "<S> the inseparability of cv four - mode cluster state are expressed by the correlations of position and momentum of@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite , and cv four - partite ghz state by total position @xmath32 and relative momentum @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that some two - party correlation of position or momentum components are included in the criterion inequalities of cv four - partite cluster state and ghz state .     </S>",
    "<S> , width=288 ]    for implementing the nonlocal nopa the four submodes of the four - mode entangled state @xmath35 , are distributed into the remote signal input , idler input , signal output and idler output stations , respectively . the mode @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and the input signal @xmath4 ( idler @xmath38 ) </S>",
    "<S> are combined at a 50/50 beam splitter inside the signal ( idler ) input station . </S>",
    "<S> then the two input stations independently perform the homodyne measurements on themselves two output beams from their 50/50 beam splitter to extract the amplitude- and phase - quadratures of optical fields . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained quadratures @xmath39 are respectively @xmath40 the input stations send these measured results to both remote output stations respectively . after receiving these measurement results </S>",
    "<S> , each output station displaces himself mode by means of a 1/99 beam splitter with an auxiliary beam , the amplitude and phase of which have been modulated via the amplitude ( am ) and phase ( pm ) modulators by the sum signals @xmath41 respectively . the position @xmath42 and momentum values @xmath43 of the modulated sum signals for displacing the entangled mode @xmath44 equal to @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are scaling factors , and that for displacing the entangled beam @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the transformation @xmath52 in the heisenberg representation , the displaced fields at the remote output stations can be expressed as @xmath53 thus we obtain the output signal and idler fields of nopa simultaneously ( same as eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pia1])and ( [ pia2 ] ) ) at the remote stations with gain factor @xmath54 in the case of perfect quantum correlations ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gain of nopa can be adjusted by the reflectivity rate @xmath20 of the beam splitter @xmath19 . under the realistic condition with the imperfect four - mode entanglement , </S>",
    "<S> the extra noises will be are added in the output signals of nopa .    in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme for nonlocal optical nondegenerate parametric amplifier using a genuine four - mode entanglement . this genuine four - mode entanglement is a new class of multipartite entangled states , which can be generated with two pairs of epr entangled beams and linear optics . </S>",
    "<S> the inseparability criteria of the proposed four - mode entangled state are different from that of cv four - partite cluster state and ghz state . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal nopa can be implemented by off - line four - mode entanglement , homodyne detection , classical communication and local displacement . due to its nonlocality </S>",
    "<S> the proposed nopa might be extensively applied in cv quantum information network .    </S>",
