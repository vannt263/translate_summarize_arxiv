    "galaxies may evolve from star - forming late - types to passive early - types either via internal , secular processes or through mechanisms induced by their environment . disentangling these two pathways and understanding the nature and impact of various environmental processes on galaxy evolution is a major goal of contemporary astrophysics .",
    "while the overall star formation density of the universe has declined significantly since a redshift of @xmath10 @xcite , this evolution appears to be accelerated in dense environments , with groups and clusters of galaxies containing a lower fraction of star - forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass and redshift than the general field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work has demonstrated that the effect of secular evolution in quenching star formation , primarily driven by galaxy stellar mass , can be separated from that of the galaxy environment @xcite .",
    "the former effect dominates at high galaxy masses , whereas environmental quenching of star formation becomes increasingly important at lower masses .",
    "possible mechanisms for a more rapid quenching of low - mass galaxies in dense environments include tidal interactions , harassment , ram pressure stripping , starvation , and major and minor mergers .",
    "groups of galaxies are particularly interesting in this respect . containing around half of all galaxies and most of the stellar mass in the local universe @xcite",
    ", they represent a key environment in the hierarchical build - up of cosmic structure .",
    "the galaxy population within groups has evolved significantly since @xmath11 , with the fraction of emission - line galaxies having declined substantially @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , the emerging picture is one in which star formation in star - forming galaxies of a given stellar mass is similar in groups and the field , whereas the fraction of such galaxies is not ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite used inferred h@xmath12 equivalent widths of galaxies within a large sample of low - redshift groups in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) catalogs to show that the fraction of star - forming galaxies depends systematically on local density , but the actual star formation rate _ in _ such galaxies does not .",
    "this has recently been shown to apply also at intermediate redshifts , @xmath13 and at fixed stellar mass @xcite , and the result has further been extended to galaxies in both nearby @xcite and distant ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) clusters and superclusters .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence that the truncation of star formation is accomplished on short timescales , rapidly enough to leave the average star formation properties of star - forming galaxies largely unaffected .",
    "this would be true even in groups of fairly low mass , and support for this comes from recent studies based on uv star formation rates in hickson compact groups which are generally relatively sparse systems .",
    "such work has revealed a pronounced deficit of galaxies with moderate specific ( i.e. , stellar - mass - normalized ) star formation rates @xcite , consistent with a rapid , environment  driven transition from ( perhaps temporarily enhanced ) star formation to quiescence .",
    "although the dominant responsible mechanism(s ) have yet to be unambiguously identified , it is clear that galaxy  galaxy interactions could play a prominent role both in compact and more typical groups , given the relatively low velocity dispersions characteristic of these environments .",
    "recognizing that a detailed multi - wavelength characterization of the coupling between global group properties and those of the group members themselves could offer important new insights , we initiated the _ xi _ groups survey , a study of a statistically representative sample of 25 redshift - selected groups at @xmath0 @xcite . in this framework , we have previously presented star formation rates ( sfrs ) from _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath15 m data for a subset of nine groups @xcite .",
    "results revealed star - forming galaxy fractions that bridge those of the field and massive clusters , being everywhere higher than those in cluster outskirts but lower than in the field by @xmath16% on average .",
    "the fractions showed no systematic dependence on global group properties such as velocity dispersion or total stellar mass .",
    "in addition , and in line with the above previous studies , specific sfrs were generally found to be similar to those in the field .",
    "one limitation of our _ spitzer _ study was the narrowness of the rectangular region ( @xmath17 , equivalent to @xmath18  mpc radius at the sample redshift ) covered by our mips observations . to fully understand the suppression of star formation in groups requires establishing the star - forming properties of group members out to larger radii , and including galaxies that are encountering the group environment for the first time .",
    "for example , simulations @xcite and isolated observations @xcite suggest that gaseous stripping and starvation can suppress star formation in disk galaxies on their first passage through even low - mass groups . in more massive clusters ,",
    "star formation rates appear suppressed out to @xmath19 ( @xcite ; here @xmath20 is the radius enclosing a mean overdensity of 200 relative to the critical density ) .",
    "recent studies have extended this conclusion to even larger radii @xcite , revealing a suppression in the fraction of star - forming galaxies out to @xmath21  mpc from cluster cores @xcite .",
    "however , other works have also shown that star formation can be locally enhanced well outside the cluster virial radius for galaxies within the filaments feeding these structures @xcite , with galaxy  galaxy interactions among infalling galaxies providing a possible explanation . testing the general validity of these results for low - mass groups requires full coverage of the group environment out to the field and infall regions .",
    "here we extend our previous _",
    "study by presenting _",
    "data for most of the full _ xi _ sample .",
    "apart from providing improved statistics due to the increased sample size , the _ galex _ field - of - view of @xmath22 also allows coverage of each group field out to @xmath23  mpc , corresponding to at least @xmath1 for these systems .",
    "this continuous coverage of all regions from the general `` field '' through the infall regions to the dense group cores enables a complete census of the star - forming properties of group galaxies , including those only now encountering the group environment .",
    "we assume @xmath24  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . at the sample median redshift of @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 corresponds to 69  kpc and the total _",
    "field to @xmath29  mpc diameter .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath30 level .",
    "details of the _ xi _ sample selection are given in @xcite , but we repeat here that the sample comprises 25 groups selected from systems identified by @xcite in the 100-k data release of the 2dfgrs @xcite . groups with at least five members and having velocity dispersion @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 were selected randomly within the redshift range @xmath320.062 to span the full parameter space in @xmath33 , galaxy richness , and estimated virial radii . barring any inherent biases in the friends - of - friends algorithm used to build the parent group catalog , the sample is intended to be unbiased and truly representative of the low - redshift group population .",
    "an extensive imaging and spectroscopic campaign with the imacs spectrograph at the 6.5-m baade / magellan telescope at las campanas has more than doubled the number of spectroscopically identified group members compared to the original @xcite catalog .",
    "this has enabled highly reliable estimates of velocity dispersion and luminosity centroid for each group . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt as group centers the location of the brightest group galaxy within a projected distance of 0.5  mpc of the @xmath34-band luminosity - weighted center , and with velocity within @xmath35 of the group mean . a forthcoming paper ( l.  bai et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) will provide the full details and results of our optical spectroscopy and _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath15 m imaging of the full _ xi _ sample , along with the individual galaxy redshifts , stellar mass estimates , uv photometric measurements , and sfr estimates used in the present work .    following the procedure in @xcite",
    ", we have here complemented our optical spectroscopy within the @xmath36 imacs field - of - view with redshift measurements from existing catalogs out to @xmath37 from the center of each group .",
    "these redshifts come mainly from the 2dfgrs ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "galaxies were included in the present study if having recession velocities within @xmath38 of the group mean , as determined from the galaxies within the central @xmath39  mpc .",
    "some fraction of these objects are likely to represent a population of infalling galaxies that are only now encountering the group environment , and some may represent true `` field '' galaxies .",
    "this allows us to probe the impact of the group environment on the uv properties of galaxies out to well beyond the group virial radii .",
    "however , we emphasize that this auxiliary sample is more heterogeneous than the one covered by our imacs spectroscopy , and that some of these galaxies should be considered candidate rather than bona fide group members",
    ". we will comment on the potential impact of this whenever relevant .",
    "a subset of the group members has five - band photometry from the sdss . for these galaxies",
    ", we used the _ kcorrect _ package @xcite , to derive a relation between their @xmath34band stellar mass - to - light ratio and their @xmath40@xmath34 color .",
    "this relation was then used to estimate stellar masses @xmath41 for the full group sample , with a typical uncertainty for individual galaxies of @xmath42% ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for 17 of the 833 galaxies discussed in this paper ( 2% ) , only @xmath34 magnitudes are available , and @xmath41 for these was determined in a similar fashion from their @xmath34 magnitudes alone .      of the 25 groups within the _ xi _ sample",

    "as mentioned , all uv photometry for individual galaxies will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( l.  bai et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    with most of our group members remaining unresolved , we can not directly estimate the contribution of any active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity to the uv flux .",
    "however , the fraction of agn identifiable on the basis of their optical emission lines or their x - ray properties is small for the _ xi _ sample , at the few per  cent level @xcite , so agn contamination in the uv is generally unlikely to be important .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the agn fraction on global environment is generally inferred to be weak @xcite , so we do not expect environmental variations in agn activity to significantly impact our results .    the approximate 100% completeness limit for our _ galex _ observations in either band can be estimated from the apparent ( i.e.  not extinction - corrected ) magnitude histograms of all sources detected in the field of mz770 , the group with the shortest identical exposure in fuv and nuv , and mz4592 , the group field suffering the strongest galactic extinction ( cf .  table  [ tab , log ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig , histo ] , incompleteness in the nuv becomes apparent for the mz4592 field below @xmath99 .",
    "we therefore adopt this value as our sample - wide uv completeness limit in the following . taking a more conservative limit , e.g. , @xmath100 ,",
    "would result in slightly poorer statistics without affecting any of our conclusions . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite estimate a 90% fuv completeness limit of @xmath101 for _ galex _ observations of similar duration and galactic extinction .",
    "the uv light from star - forming galaxies is dominated by emission from intermediate - mass stars younger than @xmath102  yr @xcite .",
    "assuming that the sfr has remained roughly constant over this timescale , it should be proportional to the intrinsic galaxy uv luminosity @xmath103 .",
    "estimates of uv sfrs are model - dependent , however , in part because they need to be corrected for attenuation by dust ( potentially by an order of magnitude ) , and in part because the conversion of the dust - corrected @xmath103 to an sfr depends on the assumed stellar metallicity and imf , along with the geometry of the distribution of dust and stars .    to estimate these dust corrections , we utilize our existing 24@xmath15 m photometry wherever possible and follow the approach of @xcite to derive the fuv attenuation @xmath104 as a function of fuv and total infrared luminosity @xmath105 ( see @xcite ) , using @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath108  hz is the effective frequency of the _ galex _ fuv band , and @xmath109 is the measured specific fuv luminosity ( in erg  s@xmath4  hz@xmath4 ) .",
    "dust - corrected star formation rates were then obtained as @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the dust - corrected specific fuv luminosity .",
    "equation  ( [ eq , sfr ] ) is valid for a salpeter imf and a mean stellar metallicity of @xmath112 .    for the galaxies without a _ spitzer _ detection , fuv magnitudes",
    "were first corrected according to equation  ( 6 ) in @xcite , based on uv  magnitudes of normal ( nuv  r@xmath113 ) star - forming galaxies : @xmath114 where @xmath115  =  ( fuv  nuv ) is the rest - frame uv color . the associated dust - corrected sfrs were then compared to those derived on the basis of equation  ( [ eq , dust1 ] ) for all galaxies detected at both nuv , fuv , and 24@xmath15 m .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig , sfr ] , as a function of the sfr from fuv@xmath116ir data [ i.e. , equations  ( [ eq , dust1 ] ) and ( [ eq , sfr ] ) ] and of galaxy stellar mass . using uv data alone on average tends to overestimate the sfr relative to the result when combining uv and ir data , and this is more prominent for galaxies with low sfr and high @xmath41 ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .    to bring our uv  only estimates into better agreement with those obtained from the combined use of uv and 24@xmath15 m data , we performed a linear fit to the full data in figure  [ fig , sfr](b ) , implying @xmath117 with a mean absolute deviation of 0.18  dex ( which is comparable to the typical uncertainty on @xmath41 ) .",
    "this result , shown as a solid line in the figure , is consistent with that obtained for the blue galaxies only ( nuv  r@xmath113 , for which equation  ( [ eq , dust2 ] ) is valid ) .",
    "we use it to correct the inferred sfr for galaxies without a _ spitzer _ detection at a given @xmath41 . as will be discussed in section  [ sec , sfr ] , the resulting sfrs are , on average , in very good agreement with those obtained in other similar studies . for our",
    "adopted uv completeness limit and a minimum galactic extinction of 0.1  mag ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab , log ] ) , equation  ( [ eq , sfr ] ) would imply that we are complete to sfr@xmath118  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 in all groups before correction for dust .",
    "the inferred uv and star formation properties of the group members are here presented with a focus on their dependence on galaxy environment , using total group stellar mass and/or velocity dispersion as main indicators of global group environment .",
    "one further indicator , discussed below , is obtained by dividing the groups into ones containing uv  optical red and blue central galaxies , respectively .    local galaxy environment is quantified by projected distance @xmath34 to the adopted group center , optionally normalized by @xmath20 .",

    "results range from @xmath1201200  kpc ( median of 520  kpc ) , implying that all groups are covered by _",
    "galex _ to at least @xmath1 .",
    "another commonly used indicator of local environment is the galaxy surface density @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the projected distance of each galaxy to its fifth nearest neighbor .",
    "this can be reliably used across different systems , provided these are globally broadly similar .",
    "however , our groups spans a wide range in richness and estimated @xmath20 , so at fixed 3d galaxy density @xmath123 , projection effects would act to boost @xmath124 progressively more in the larger systems . to compensate for this ,",
    "we employ instead an estimate of @xmath123 , derived by normalizing @xmath124 by a characteristic radius @xmath125 for each group .",
    "noting that self - similarity would require @xmath126 , we simply take @xmath127 . all results reported here are qualitatively similar though if plotted against @xmath124 instead of @xmath123 .",
    "one further issue is our lower spectroscopic completeness outside the @xmath128  mpc imacs field - of - view , which could act to systematically bias @xmath124 low at large radii .",
    "however , we find no evidence for a break around @xmath36 in the distribution of @xmath124 vs.  @xmath34 for all group members .",
    "furthermore , the distributions of @xmath129 for the spectroscopically identified members within and outside the imacs field are broadly similar down to at least @xmath130 , as shown in figure  [ fig , complete ] .",
    "we find that all our results are quantitatively similar , and all conclusions unaffected , if computing @xmath124 by only including galaxies brighter than this magnitude .",
    "hence , to fully exploit our extensive imacs spectroscopy , which extends beyond @xmath20 for all groups and to @xmath1 for @xmath131% of them , we compute @xmath124 and @xmath123 using all available members .",

    "thus , most of these six blue centrals are likely to be physically situated in the group core . on average , they have lower stellar masses than do the red , passive ones , and they also reside further from the group luminosity centroid and in groups of lower total stellar mass ( @xmath140log@xmath141 vs.  @xmath142 within @xmath39  mpc ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath143 vs.  @xmath144  km  s@xmath4 ) , and richness ( @xmath145 vs.  @xmath146 ) than do red central galaxies .",
    "this suggests that our blue , late - type centrals reside in group halos that are relatively less massive and dynamically younger , consistent with the finding that the fraction of central group galaxies that are ellipticals is a strong function of group halo mass @xcite .",
    "hence , these blue centrals likely represent ordinary bright star - forming galaxies , rather than objects with recent ( dust - obscured ) star formation fueled by cooling of intragroup gas .      given equation  ( [ eq , sfr ] )",
    ", the fraction of group members detected in the fuv is equivalent to the fraction of galaxies forming stars above a certain rate . to explore how this quantity depends on galaxy properties and environment",
    ", we first apply our cut at @xmath147 in the fuv ( i.e. , sfr@xmath148@xmath3  yr@xmath4 before dust correction ) to homogenize uv completeness across the sample .",
    "the resulting sample was also split at its median stellar mass of @xmath149@xmath3 , to elucidate any dependence on galaxy mass .",
    "figure  [ fig , uvfrac ] shows the resulting mean fuv fractions as a function of local galaxy environment .",
    "the results reveal a clear rise toward group outskirts , out to the largest radii and lowest galaxy densities probed .",
    "this trend is robust in both galaxy stellar mass bins when plotted against @xmath123 , but is generally much stronger for low - mass galaxies . these display lower uv fractions in group cores than do high - mass ones , reversing the situation at large radii where the higher uv fraction of low - mass galaxies simply reflects the standard dependence of ssfr on galaxy mass ( see section  [ sec , sfr ] ) .    on average ,",
    "the star - forming fraction among low - mass galaxies is suppressed out to at least @xmath150  mpc and @xmath151 , thus mirroring results for much more massive clusters @xcite .",
    "this implies that the group environment is influencing galaxy properties out to similar overdensity radii as in much more massive structures .",
    "if separating group and field / infall environments at these radii , we find average star - forming ( sf ) fractions above the uv completeness limit of @xmath152% in groups and @xmath153% in the field .",
    "this implies a decrease in mean sf fraction by @xmath154% in groups relative to the field , in agreement with the 30% decline found from our _ spitzer _ data of nine of the groups @xcite .",
    "these trends could potentially just reflect an underlying variation in average galaxy stellar mass , with high - density group cores being dominated by more massive , red , and generally uv - faint galaxies .",
    "however , any residual mass dependence from bin to bin in panels ( a)(c ) is limited to a non - systematic variation in mean @xmath41 with environment of @xmath155  dex .",
    "furthermore , the decline in fuv fraction with @xmath41 is weaker than that with environmental parameters , as shown in figure  [ fig , uvfrac](d ) , even when including the uv detections below our completeness limit .",
    "the implication is that the observed trends are indeed environment  driven rather than reflecting environmental variations in mean @xmath41 .    to explore any dependence on global group environment , figure",
    "[ fig , uvfrac2 ] displays the total fuv fractions within @xmath20 as a function of total group stellar mass @xmath156 , in four stellar mass bins containing a similar number of groups .",
    "the data show a systematic decline in average star - forming galaxy fraction with group stellar mass and velocity dispersion , from @xmath157% in the lowest - mass bin to @xmath16% for the most massive systems .",
    "although subject to larger errors , the overall trend persists if subdividing the galaxy population into a low- and high - mass half ( see figure inset ) , and so is not driven by systematic differences in average galaxy @xmath41 with total group stellar mass .",
    "hence , even across the range of relatively low host halo masses considered here , the overall star formation activity is systematically modulated by global environment .      for comparing dust - corrected sfrs of the 601  galaxies detected in both uv bands",
    ", we bring all objects on an equal footing by presenting their specific sfr in figure  [ fig , ssfr ] .    above our approximate completeness limit",
    ", there is a clear decline in the average ssfr with @xmath41 across three orders of magnitude in stellar mass , and a corresponding increase in the uv  optical color .",
    "the dashed line in the figure shows the value of ssfr = @xmath158  yr@xmath4 that corresponds to the adopted distinction between passive and star - forming galaxies at nuv ",
    "r=4 , as suggested by a regression fit between the two quantities ; this is a reliable and robust criterion , with only 3% of the bluer group members having estimated ssfrs below this value",
    ". the distribution of ssfr values also mirrors the bimodality seen for the nuv ",
    "r colors , and both distributions are clearly continuous , with no gap at intermediate colors or ssfrs .",
    "for the star - forming galaxies with log@xmath159 , an outlier - resistant least - squares fit to the data in figure  [ fig , ssfr ] suggests a scaling relation of the form @xmath160 with a mean absolute deviation of 0.24  dex .",
    "the result implies sfr@xmath161 .",
    "this is nominally slightly flatter than , but broadly consistent with , the relation obtained from _",
    "_ data of much larger samples of the global low - redshift galaxy population , sfr@xmath162 @xcite .",
    "some flattening of this relation in groups relative to the field may in fact be expected , if the sfr of low - mass galaxies is suppressed in groups .",
    "indeed , at the median log@xmath163 of the relevant galaxies , equation  ( [ eq , ssfr ] ) would predict a mean ssfr which is 3845% lower than seen for the field in the above studies ( when corrected for differences in the assumed imf , where necessary ) . as will be shown",
    ", this difference is significant and in excellent agreement with that inferred from the _ xi _ data themselves .",
    "the important implications are that the mean ssfr of star - forming galaxies is suppressed in groups relative to the field at a given @xmath41 , and that our estimated sfrs are not significantly biased compared to those derived in other similar studies .",
    "to further explore this suppression in ssfr , we plot in figure  [ fig , ssfr_rad ] the ssfr of star - forming galaxies against local environment in equal - number bins .",
    "the sample has further bin equally split into three bins in stellar mass , to test for systematic dependencies for low and high  mass galaxies separately . any residual mass dependence _ within _ these bins is negligible , as the mean @xmath41 within each bin varies non - systematically with environment by @xmath164  dex in all three diagrams .",
    "environmental trends are clearly present , particularly for the lowest - mass galaxies , where the mean ssfr declines by 0.4  dex across the region probed . at @xmath165 ,",
    "any systematic trends become negligible , however . hence , not only does the fraction of sf galaxies vary with environment for our sample , but the actual sfr _ within _ star - forming galaxies",
    "does so too at fixed galaxy stellar mass @xmath166 .",
    "note that , except for the highest@xmath41 bin , the suppression of sfr/@xmath41 is significant out to at least @xmath167  mpc  @xmath7 , similar to what is seen for the sf fractions themselves .    to our knowledge , this is the first time such a trend has been reported .",
    "no such trends were noticed in our earlier study ( when considering galaxies at @xmath168 ; @xcite ) , plausibly due to poorer statistics , smaller spatial coverage , and the fact that the effect is subtle for galaxies above this mass limit .",
    "the result suggests that with the full _ xi _ sample , we are now for the first time witnessing the _ ongoing _ quenching of star formation within nearby galaxy groups .",
    "hence , such quenching is still taking place in the local universe within the relatively low - mass galaxy structures that dominate galaxy redshift surveys .      in massive galaxy clusters",
    ", infalling galaxies can show enhanced star formation at intermediate radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , possibly due to interactions with other nearby galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig , ssfr_rad ] suggests that a similar effect does not occur in smaller groups . to verify this",
    ", starburst galaxies were first identified within the groups . in line with our previous analysis of the 24@xmath15 m data @xcite ,",
    "starbursts are here defined as galaxies with a current sfr of at least three times their past average , i.e.  with birthrate parameters @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and where @xmath171 and @xmath172 is the typical stellar age and gas recycling fraction , respectively . assuming @xmath173 and @xmath171 corresponding to a formation redshift @xmath174 , just prior to the peak in the cosmic sfr density , the resulting limit of @xmath175 is shown as a dot  dashed horizontal line in figure  [ fig , ssfr ] .",
    "the spatial variation in starburst galaxy fraction is illustrated in figure  [ fig , starbursts ] .",
    "this plot confirms the absence of a characteristic density or radius at which star formation is enhanced , with fractions declining , within the errors , monotonically and significantly toward group cores . within the uncertainties ,",
    "there is also no systematic dependence of the starburst fraction within 0@xmath20 , 12@xmath20 , or 23@xmath20 on total group stellar mass .",
    "hence , the enhanced starburst activity reported around galaxy clusters does not persist into the group regime , not even for the most massive groups in the sample .",
    "the unlikely alternative is that any localized enhancement in ssfr occurs at @xmath176  mpc , i.e.  partially beyond the @xmath177 - 3  mpc region identified for clusters @xcite .    among the group members with @xmath178 ( for which our detection of starburst galaxies should be complete ) , a small fraction @xmath179 ( @xmath180% ) can be classified as starbursts above our uv completeness limit .",
    "this is slightly higher than the value of @xmath181% found for similar - mass galaxies in our 24@xmath15 m data of a subset of the group sample .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig , starbursts ] , the difference is at least partly explicable on account of the larger physical region probed here ; for example , the fraction is reduced to @xmath182% within @xmath1 and to @xmath183% within @xmath184  kpc , the region probed by our _ spitzer _ mips data in the narrowest direction .",
    "the inferred fraction within the full _ galex _ field is also consistent with the value of @xmath185% derived for the local universe by @xcite .",
    "the absence of starbursts with @xmath186 in figure  [ fig , starbursts ] is furthermore consistent with the lack of enhanced star formation seen within groups at @xmath187 down to this mass completeness limit @xcite .",
    "the inference that sfr/@xmath41 within star - forming galaxies is environmentally suppressed in groups relative to the field is a novel result , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "it suggests that we are directly observing the ongoing quenching of star formation in dense environments .",
    "we speculate that this result was not identified in previous group studies for at least three reasons .",
    "first , while our group sample is homogeneously selected , the global group properties are very heterogeneous , with groups spanning at least an order of magnitude in velocity dispersion , total stellar mass , richness , and x - ray luminosity ( see table  [ tab , log ] and @xcite ) . combined with the large _ galex _ field which covers galaxies well into the infall regions , this allows us to self - consistently probe the full range of local and global galaxy environments up to the scale of massive groups .",
    "second , many of these groups are likely dynamically young @xcite and so contain a significant population of gas - rich star - forming galaxies which have been only mildly , if at all , affected by the group environment . if much of the environmentally induced gas loss from galaxies , e.g. , via starvation , occurs when the group or cluster first collapses @xcite , then the inclusion of such dynamically unevolved systems is crucial for observing sf quenching in action .",
    "finally , our deep spectroscopy enables inclusion of numerous low - mass galaxies down to @xmath188 , for which environmental effects are found to be be particularly prominent .",
    "this is only feasible for nearby group samples such as this ; other systematic multi - wavelength studies of groups focus instead on systems at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) for which the limiting galaxy stellar mass is significantly higher .",
    "our results show that both the star - forming and starbursting galaxy fractions decline toward dense group cores , in general agreement with results for other group samples at low and intermediate redshifts @xcite and with those from our 24@xmath15 m imaging @xcite .",
    "importantly , the decline in sf fraction is present also at fixed stellar mass , and with galaxies below @xmath189  @xmath3 showing stronger environmental trends than do more massive objects .",
    "globally , the sf fractions within @xmath1 are 35% lower than seen at the largest radii probed .",
    "comparing this to our corresponding 24@xmath15 m results for a subset of this sample @xcite suggests excellent agreement between the uv and mid - ir results , but definitive confirmation of this will have to await the _ spitzer _",
    "results for the full sample ( l.  bai et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in contrast , the observed systematic decline in sf fraction with total group stellar mass was not seen in our preliminary _ spitzer _",
    "analysis , possibly due to poorer statistics and the consideration of a fixed metric region for all groups .    for star - forming galaxies alone , a systematic suppression of ssfr with local environmental parameters",
    "is further seen , persisting out to the largest radii and lowest galaxy densities probed .",
    "this is preferentially observed within low - mass galaxies , with the trend becoming negligible at stellar masses @xmath190  @xmath3 . at",
    "fixed , low galaxy stellar mass , the suppression is also modest , amounting to a factor of @xmath191 for sf galaxies in the densest group regions ( figure  [ fig , ssfr_rad ] ) .",
    "this is much less than the corresponding variation with stellar mass for the same galaxies ( @xmath192  orders of magnitude ; cf .",
    "figure  [ fig , ssfr ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , if taking galaxies at @xmath193  mpc@xmath7 as representative of the field and infall regions ( see figures  [ fig , uvfrac ] and [ fig , ssfr_rad ] ) , then the mean and @xmath30 error on the ssfr of all sf galaxies in these regions is @xmath194  yr@xmath4 , significantly higher than the @xmath195  yr@xmath4 found within the group environment itself . given that the mean stellar mass of the two sub - populations are similar , this implies an average suppression in star formation activity _ within _ all star - forming galaxies in groups by @xmath196% relative to the `` field '' value within our data .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed @xmath197% decline relative to typical values for large local galaxy samples discussed in section  [ sec , sfr ] .",
    "the observed environmental variation in ssfr is at odds with the generally negligible difference between typical ssfrs in groups and the field seen in other studies of group samples at low and intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of galaxies well below the @xmath198 limit of these other studies afforded by the proximity of our sample as well as the nature of the _ xi _ groups and of the present data ( as described above ) may all contribute to this difference .    before interpreting these results",
    ", we note that two effects could bias the results in figures  [ fig , uvfrac ] and [ fig , ssfr_rad ] .",
    "first , the differences in spectroscopic completeness between the @xmath199  mpc imacs data and the auxiliary data employed at larger radii imply a relative shortfall of low - mass ( i.e. , high - ssfr ) galaxies at @xmath200  mpc in the sample . however , this would only act to suppress the observed trends , which could therefore be even stronger than inferred .",
    "second , the presence of interlopers , unaffected by the group environment , would also dampen any real trends .",
    "the importance of this can be assessed by quantifying the projected density of sf background galaxies as determined at large radii .",
    "to do so , we take galaxies at and beyond the outermost data points in figures  [ fig , uvfrac ] and [ fig , ssfr_rad ] , ie .  those with @xmath201",
    "mpc@xmath202 or @xmath203 , as belonging to the field .",
    "in addition , we only consider galaxies with @xmath204 , in order to homogenize spectroscopic completeness across all radii .",
    "this yields a mean @xmath205  mpc@xmath206 for the projected density of such sf galaxies in the field . within the group region ( @xmath207 )",
    ", the corresponding value is @xmath208  mpc@xmath206 , rising to @xmath209  mpc@xmath206 within @xmath20 .",
    "these results do not change if only considering galaxies above our uv completeness limit , suggesting that no more than 57% of the @xmath210 sf galaxies seen within our groups are interlopers .    for fainter galaxies ,",
    "a larger interloper fraction can not be ruled out , due to the lower spectroscopic completeness at large radii .",
    "however , we do note that the 57% would represent a _",
    "upper limit if the fraction of ( low - mass , high - ssfr ) galaxies fainter than @xmath211 is lower in groups than in the field .",
    "this assertion would be in line with the observed decline in the dwarf - to - giant galaxy ratio toward cluster cores @xcite .",
    "the tentative implication is that the great majority of sf galaxies identified within the _ xi _ groups are physically associated with the group , even those in the densest regions of our most massive groups . in any case",
    ", a larger interloper fraction would only act to suppress the observed trends , which are most prominent for the lowest - mass galaxies , so in that sense our results are conservative .    in summary ,",
    "the dependence of both sf fractions and the ssfrs of sf galaxies on local group environment is a robust result .",
    "while the sfrs depend primarily on stellar mass above our uv completeness limit , with sfr@xmath212 , there is a significant residual dependence on local environment at fixed stellar mass .",
    "local galaxy environment thus plays an important role in regulating both the proportion and actual activity of star - forming galaxies in groups .",
    "the fact that the sf galaxy fraction generally declines with increasing total stellar group mass suggests that _ global _ group environment may also modulate star formation . to explore this possibility",
    ", we plot the star - forming fractions and the ssfr of star - forming galaxies as a function of @xmath123 in figure  [ fig , environ ] while controlling for global group parameters .",
    "to maximize the strength of any trends , the bottom panel only considers the low - mass half of the star - forming galaxies , for which the dependence of ssfr on local environment is strongest . in this panel ,",
    "the bin - to - bin variation in mean @xmath41 with environment is @xmath213  dex and not systematically dependent on @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "the results indicate that , at fixed @xmath123 , the star - forming galaxy fraction and the ssfr of star - forming galaxies are more heavily suppressed in the cores of high - mass groups with `` evolved '' central galaxies .",
    "in fact , the trends in figure  [ fig , ssfr_rad ] are mainly driven by galaxies in the latter groups , since no clear environmental suppression of ssfr is seen for the low - mass groups with blue central galaxies . to understand whether the absence of a trend in the low - mass groups is driven simply by the",
    "arguably less evolved systems with blue centrals , we subdivide the low - mass groups according to central galaxy color .",
    "figure  [ fig , lowmass ] shows the resulting mean ssfrs as a function of environment for these two classes of groups .",
    "we focus again on the low - mass galaxies only ( @xmath214@xmath3 ) , in order to maximize the strength of any trends . while the low - mass groups with red centrals do show mild evidence of a trend with @xmath34 , the mean specific sfrs of galaxies within the two types of groups are similar within @xmath215  mpc  @xmath216 .",
    "hence within the relevant radii and densities , there is no strong evidence for `` less evolved '' systems of a given low @xmath217 to behave dramatically different from those containing red centrals .",
    "the above results suggest that , at fixed local galaxy environment , a residual contribution to quenching is present whose impact scales with total group stellar mass .",
    "one caveat to this interpretation is that @xmath123 ( and @xmath124 ) may measure different `` environments '' in small and large systems , with a given value of @xmath123 being representative of a relatively larger range in @xmath218 in small systems .",
    "however , all trends in figure  [ fig , environ ] are qualitatively similar , and all conclusions unaffected , if instead plotting the results against @xmath34 or @xmath218 . to further verify that the inferred variations in sf activity at fixed ( high ) @xmath219 are not just reflecting variations in @xmath123 itself with total group stellar mass",
    ", we divide the star - forming galaxies according to their median @xmath123 , consider only galaxies within @xmath20 , and control for galaxy stellar mass by only considering the low - mass half of the resulting sample .",
    "the average ssfr of these galaxies in the two bins of @xmath123 are shown as a function of @xmath220 in figure  [ fig , massdepend ] .",
    "a decline with @xmath220 is seen in both bins of @xmath123 , confirming that the suppression in sf at fixed local environment does scale with total group stellar mass .",
    "the immediate interpretation of the above results is that the suppression of sf depends on both local and global group environment , and so is possibly modulated by at least two different mechanisms .",
    "galaxy density , or some quantity scaling with it , plays a role in shutting down sf in groups .",
    "tidal interactions and mergers are plausible candidates , as these should be important in these low@xmath33 environments , especially in regions of high galaxy density . in addition",
    ", quenching is more efficient at fixed galaxy density in higher-@xmath33 groups , opposite to what is expected from tidal galaxy  galaxy interactions .",
    "if the latter are important , then an additional mechanism whose efficiency is independent of @xmath219 but instead scales with group stellar mass and acts predominantly in the densest regions must also have an impact .",
    "gas - dynamical processes such as ram pressure / viscous stripping and starvation are obvious candidates .",
    "possible clues to the quenching mechanism emerge from the result that an environmental dependence of ssfr in blue , star - forming galaxies at fixed ( low ) galaxy mass is mainly observed in the more massive groups with red central galaxies , not within the lowest - mass ones with blue centrals . nor",
    "is such a trend observed in massive low-@xmath221 clusters @xcite , although some evidence is seen when including sf galaxies in @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 groups down to ssfr@xmath222  yr@xmath4 @xcite . to explain these results",
    ", one could hypothesize that the blue sf galaxies observed in low-@xmath221 clusters , which comprise a significantly smaller fraction than in groups ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , are strongly dominated by interlopers associated with the general field ( as supported by the inference that backsplash galaxies in clusters have essentially no sf left after just a single passage through the cluster ; @xcite ) . hence ,",
    "little difference in ssfr between blue field and `` cluster '' sf galaxies should be expected . on the other hand , in the smallest and youngest groups (",
    "some of which are perhaps collapsing only now ) most sf galaxies will be real group members in which star formation may not yet have been strongly suppressed . only in relatively massive , evolved groups below the scale of clusters can we directly observe the ongoing environmental quenching of sf .",
    "this raises the possibility of constraining the timescales @xmath223 for quenching sf in groups . in order to see a correlation between ssfr and clustercentric radius one needs a coincidence between @xmath223 and the crossing timescale @xmath224",
    "conversely , if @xmath225 ( `` case  a '' ) then all sf will be shut down near the virial radius , so there will be little radial trend further in ( where sf galaxies will mainly be interlopers , and the radial trend in sf fraction will reflect that of the interloper fraction ) .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath226 ( `` case  b '' ) then galaxies will perform multiple crossings as sf is quenched , so again there will be little radial trend . for virialized systems which have collapsed at the same epoch , @xmath224 is independent of system mass , since @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "hence , the interpretation suggested here is that the quenching timescale @xmath223 is generally shorter in more massive systems , with rich clusters falling under case  a above , the poorest ( and/or youngest ) groups under case  b , and with relatively massive groups ( @xmath229500  km  s@xmath4 ) as the only systems in between .    for the @xmath230@xmath3 half of our group sample , the mean linear crossing time @xcite is in the range @xmath2311.6  gyr , depending on the maximum radius considered ( @xmath20 , 2@xmath20 , or @xmath39  mpc ) .",
    "since sf is not completely shut down after a single crossing , this would suggest a typical quenching timescale of @xmath232  gyr in these systems .",
    "this result provides strong independent confirmation of recent estimates of @xmath2323  gyr based on simple models for the accretion of galaxies onto groups @xcite .    if galaxy  galaxy interactions alone induce quenching through rapid consumption of gas associated with an interaction - triggered starburst phase , then the presently observed starburst fraction of @xmath233 inside @xmath151 limits the characteristic timescale of this phase @xcite .",
    "the sf fraction in groups has declined relative to that of the field since at least @xmath2340.6 @xcite , i.e. , over the past @xmath235  gyr .",
    "if mergers and interactions have accomplished this with a constant @xmath236 with redshift , then a quenched fraction of @xmath237 today requires a typical quenching timescale @xmath238  gyr .",
    "this timescale is too short in comparison to the crossing times mentioned above .",
    "in addition , there is no indication of enhanced sf or starburst activity at small - to - intermediate radii , which could otherwise indicate a temporary boost in sf associated with , or immediately prior to , the actual quenching .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note the detection of a pronounced bimodality in ssfrs in hickson compact groups ( hcgs ; @xcite ) , with a sparsely populated region separating low and high - ssfr systems ( @xmath239  yr@xmath4 and @xmath240  yr@xmath4 respectively ; see also figure  [ fig , ssfr ] ) .",
    "this feature is more prominent than seen for our groups , other groups , in the field , or in cluster cores @xcite .",
    "it favors a rapid transition from sf to quiescence , perhaps preceded by a period of enhanced sf activity in at least some galaxies .",
    "the lack of such a clear bimodality within the _ xi _ sample may indicate a slower transition from sf to quiescence than in hcgs , or that sf is not similarly enhanced prior to the transition . the latter possibility may help to explain the lack of a clear enhancement in average ssfr or starburst fraction at intermediate radii for our sf population . since galaxy  galaxy interactions should be particularly efficient in hcgs , this further supports the idea that other quenching mechanisms are playing a relatively more important role in the _ xi _ groups .    in summary , the results inferred from figure  [ fig , environ ] , the required quenching timescales in comparison to that associated with an interaction  induced starburst phase , and the comparison to hcgs , all point to galaxy  galaxy interactions being complemented by a more slowly acting quenching mechanism within our groups .",
    "ram pressure stripping and starvation are both likely to act over gyr timescales in these relatively low - mass environments .",
    "the latter process seems particularly promising , as it can still remove hot galactic halo gas even within fairly small groups @xcite .",
    "although starvation alone is not expected to act efficiently out to such large radii and low galaxy densities as inferred here , the presence of backsplash galaxies returning to the apocenter of their orbit would help to explain our results .",
    "such galaxies comprise as much as half of all galaxies beyond the virial radius in massive clusters @xcite .",

    "these are factors of 4.2 ( 4.6 ) below the total spatially averaged output in nuv ( fuv ) at @xmath249 @xcite , implying that _",
    "xi_like groups account for @xmath250% ( @xmath251% ) of the total nuv ( fuv ) luminosity density in the local universe .",
    "in contrast to the @xcite results , these numbers do not incorporate corrections for incompleteness below our @xmath252 limit and so should be considered lower limits . hence , despite the enhanced sf quenching in groups relative to the field , at least @xmath9% of all uv star formation at low redshift still takes place within friends - of - friends redshift - selected groups similar to the _ xi _ systems .    for the 22 groups combined , we further estimate a total fuv sfr of sf galaxies within @xmath39  mpc of 180  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 , of which 54  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 ( 30% ) is unobscured .",
    "this corresponds to an average @xmath253 , in broad agreement with results for both field @xcite and cluster samples @xcite .",
    "this implies similar levels of mean uv obscuration for galaxies across all types of global environment .",
    "using _ galex _ imaging , we have presented dust - corrected star formation rates and general uv properties of the galaxy population within 23 redshift - selected groups at @xmath254 .",
    "the data cover a radius of 2.5  mpc around each group , allowing us to establish uv properties of group members from group cores into the general field , down to an sfr completeness level of 0.06  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 before dust corrections .",
    "our conclusions may be summarized as follows .",
    "the fractions of uv star - forming galaxies show a clear , systematic decline toward the dense group cores .",
    "the fractions are suppressed by 35% on average relative to the field , and the suppression is significant out to at least @xmath255  mpc  @xmath256 .",
    "this implies that the group environment is modifying galaxy properties out to similar overdensity radii as are much more massive clusters @xcite .",
    "this remains true at fixed galaxy stellar mass but is most pronounced for galaxies within the low - mass half of our uv  detected sample ( @xmath257@xmath3 ) .",
    "the star - forming fractions within @xmath20 also decline with total group stellar mass , from an average of @xmath157% in the lowest - mass groups to only @xmath16% within the most massive systems ( @xmath258  km  s@xmath4 ) .    in a minority of the groups ,",
    "the central galaxy is a late - type object with nuv ",
    "r colors consistent with ongoing star formation .",
    "these groups tend to be of lower total stellar mass and richness , and are possibly dynamically younger than the rest , as also suggested by the larger average projected distance between their central galaxy and the group luminosity centroid .",
    "the star formation rates of group galaxies depend primarily on galaxy stellar mass , in a manner broadly agreeing with results for the global low - redshift galaxy population , sfr@xmath259 .",
    "there is no evidence for enhanced star formation at intermediate radii or galaxy densities , as otherwise reported for galaxies in the filaments connecting massive clusters . at stellar masses",
    "@xmath260@xmath3 , the global fraction of starburst galaxies within the groups is @xmath261% , consistent with , but at the low end of , the range inferred globally for the nearby universe .",
    "the fraction declines significantly with local galaxy density , however , from 57% in the lowest - density regions to @xmath262% in the dense group cores .",
    "for the first time , we report a dependence on local galaxy environment of not only star - forming galaxy fractions but also of specific sfrs _ within _ blue star - forming galaxies at fixed @xmath41 .",
    "the latter trend is strongest for low - mass galaxies ( @xmath263@xmath3 ) , in which the mean specific sfr declines by a factor @xmath264 from the field to the dense group cores .",
    "this effect becomes insignificant at galaxy stellar masses @xmath265@xmath3 , plausibly explaining why it has not been detected in other detailed studies of groups at higher redshift . on average ,",
    "specific star formation rates of star - forming galaxies in groups are suppressed by @xmath266% relative to the field , taking results for the field either from our own analysis or from other _",
    "galex _ results for large , low - redshift galaxy samples .    at fixed galaxy mass and local density ,",
    "the suppression of both specific sfrs and star - forming galaxy fractions is stronger in more massive groups , especially in the dense group cores .",
    "the decline in both quantities with local density is in fact largely driven by the high - mass groups with red central galaxies , whereas most galaxies in lower - mass groups with blue centrals may have yet to be significantly affected by their environment . both local and global group environment thus play a role in quenching star formation , suggesting a combination of at least two underlying mechanisms : one whose efficiency depends primarily on radius or local galaxy density , and one which scales with total group mass and acts primarily in the group cores . galaxy ",
    "galaxy interactions and gas - dynamical processes , respectively , are the obvious candidates .",
    "the observed decline in specific sfrs toward group cores implies a characteristic timescale for shutting down star formation which is comparable to the crossing times , @xmath192  gyr .",
    "this timescale is in good agreement with other independent estimates .",
    "based on the observed starburst fraction in the groups , we demonstrate that gas consumption associated with starbursts triggered by galaxy  galaxy interactions proceed too quickly to be compatible with this timescale . combined with the absence of a bimodality in the distribution of specific sfrs , this result confirms that a more slowly acting mechanism also contributes significantly to quenching in groups .",
    "we argue that starvation is the most likely candidate , acting in concert with galaxy  galaxy interactions .",
    "the generality of these results for the global low - redshift galaxy population is attested by the finding that the total uv luminosity density provided by typical groups with more than four members is at least 25% in the local universe .",
    "this is in spite of the accelerated quenching of star formation relative to the field still taking place within these systems at present .",
    "we also find that @xmath157% of the uv star formation in such group environments is obscured , in good agreement with results obtained for field and cluster samples .",
