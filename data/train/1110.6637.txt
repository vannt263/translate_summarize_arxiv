    "the next - generation experiment to study electron - electron scattering , moller @xcite , planned at jlab following the 11 gev upgrade , will offer a new level of sensitivity and measure the parity - violating asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons off an unpolarized target to a precision of 0.73 ppb , and allow a determination of the weak mixing angle with an uncertainty of about 0.1% , a factor of five improvement over the measurement by e-158 @xcite . obviously , before we can extract reliable information from the experimental data , it is necessary to take into account ewc .",
    "ewc to the parity - violating ( pv ) mller scattering asymmetry were addressed in the literature earlier and were shown to be large  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed literature review can be found in @xcite , our first work on the topic . in @xcite , we calculated a full gauge - invariant set of the one - loop ewc and found the total correction to be close to @xmath0% , with no significant theoretical uncertainty coming from the hadronic contributions to the vacuum polarization or other uncertain input parameters . since it is possible that a much larger theoretical uncertainty may come from two - loop corrections , we investigated the importance of two - loop contribution in @xcite , by comparing corrections calculated in two different renormalization schemes ( rs )  on - shell ( os ) and constrained differential renormalization ( cdr ) @xcite  and found a difference of about 11% .",
    "this means that the two - loop ewc may be larger than previously thought and can not be dismissed , especially in the light of precision promised by moller .",
    "we divide the two - loop ewc into two classes : the q - part induced by quadratic one - loop amplitudes , and the t - part which includes the interference of born and two - loop diagrams . in @xcite , we calculated the q - part exactly and found that it can reach 4% . here , we provide a brief review of our calculations done at the one - loop level @xcite , show details of the comparison between the corrections evaluated in the os and cdr schemes @xcite , and outline some of our calculations of higher order corrections .",
    "the asymmetry between left / right longitudinally polarized electrons can be constructed in the following way : @xmath1 enhancing the contributions induced by pv electroweak interactions . the term @xmath2 stands for the differential cross section defined in the center of mass reference frame of incoming electrons . at the born level ( leading order ( lo ) ) , the asymmetry is @xmath3 where @xmath4 . as one can see from eq .",
    "[ eq : a2 ] , the asymmetry is highly sensitive to @xmath5 so any deviation from the sm value will signal new physics . obviously , before we can extract reliable information from the experimental data , it is necessary to include ewc .",
    "the cross section including one - loop matrix elements is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an interference term between the born and one - loop amplitudes ( nlo ) , and the cross section @xmath8 is a quadratic term of the same order as the two - loop contribution ( nnlo ) . to make sure that our calculations at the one - loop level are error - free ,",
    "we evaluate ewc using two different methods . our first method , `` by hand '' , is to derive the compact analytic expressions for the leading one - loop correction manually using appropriate approximations for @xmath9  gev and @xmath10  gev  @xcite .",
    "our second method , semi - automated , is to consider a full set of graphs with no approximations using computer - based algebra packages @xcite and @xcite . to make sure that we calculate a gauge - invariant set of graphs , we use two sets of renormalization conditions ( rc ) : the rc by hollik ( hrc ) introduced in @xcite for our `` by hand '' approach , and the rc proposed by denner ( drc ) in @xcite for our semi - automated method .",

    "with the one - loop corrections now under control , it is worth considering the electroweak radiative corrections at the two - loop level .",
    "one way to find some indication of the size of higher - order contributions is to compare results that are expressed in terms of quantities related to different renormalization schemes , and our tuned comparison between the results obtained in the on - shell and constrained differential renormalization schemes show a difference of about 11% .",
    "although an argument can be made that the two - loop corrections are suppressed by a factor of @xmath45 relative to the one - loop corrections , we believe that they can no longer be dismissed , especially in the light of the 2% uncertainty to asymmetry promised by the moller experiment . at the moller kinematic conditions , the part of the quadratic correction considered here can increase the asymmetry up to @xmath42 .",
    "for the high - energy region @xmath46 , a contribution from the quadratic correction can reach + 30% .",
    "it is impossible to say at this time if the q - part will be enhanced or cancelled by other two - loop radiative corrections , but we believe that its size demands a detailed and consistent consideration of the t - part , which is the current task of our group .",

    "<S> parity - violating mller scattering measurements are a powerful probe of new physics effects , and the upcoming high - precision experiments will require a new level of accuracy for electroweak radiative corrections ( ewc ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we perform the updated calculations of one - loop ewc for mller scattering asymmetry using two different approaches : semi - automatic , precise , with feynarts and formcalc as base languages , and `` by hand '' , with reasonable approximations . in addition , we provide a tuned comparison between the one - loop results obtained in two different renormalization schemes : on - shell and constrained differential renormalization . as the last step , we discuss the two - loop ewc induced by squaring one - loop diagrams , and show that the significant size of this partial correction indicates a need for a complete study of the two - loop ewc in order to meet the precision goals of future experiments . </S>"
