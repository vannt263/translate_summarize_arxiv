    "the infrared dynamics of qcd can be viewed only dimly via presently available tools . because of that , there may be surprises , as it has already happened with our understanding of nonperturbative dynamics in @xmath1=1 supersymmetric qcd @xcite . in particular",
    ", those studies showed that the conventional wisdom which has accepted that the asymptotic freedom implies confinement is not always true .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the existence of a nontrivial conformal dynamics in 3 + 1 dimensional non - supersymmetric vector like gauge theories , with a relatively large number of fermion flavors @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the roots of this problem go back to a work of banks and zaks @xcite who were first to discuss the consequences of the existence of an infrared - stable fixed point @xmath2 for @xmath3 in vector - like gauge theories .",
    "the value @xmath4 depends on the gauge group : in the case of su(3 ) gauge group , @xmath5 in the two - loop approximation .    a new insight in this problem @xcite has been , on the one hand , connected with using the results of the analysis of the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations describing chiral symmetry",
    "breaking in qcd ( for a review , see refs.@xcite ) and , on the other hand , with the discovery of the conformal window in @xmath6 supersymmetric qcd @xcite .",
    "in particular , appelquist , terning , and wijewardhana @xcite suggested that , in the case of the gauge group su(@xmath7 ) , the critical value @xmath8 separates a phase with no confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath9 ) and a phase with confinement and with chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the basic point for this suggestion was the observation that at @xmath9 the value of the infrared fixed point @xmath11 is smaller than a critical value @xmath12 , presumably needed to generate the chiral condensate @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite considered only the case when the running coupling constant @xmath13 is less than the fixed point @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the dynamics is asymptotically free ( at short distances ) both at @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "yamawaki and the author @xcite analyzed the dynamics in the whole ( @xmath15 ) plane and suggested the ( @xmath15)-phase diagram of the su(@xmath7 ) theory ( see fig . 1 below ) .. in particular , it was pointed out that one can get an interesting non - asymptotically free dynamics when the bare coupling constant @xmath16 is _ larger _ than @xmath11 , though not very large .",
    "the dynamics with @xmath17 admits a continuum limit and is interesting in itself .",
    "also , its better understanding can be important for establishing the conformal window in lattice computer simulations of the su(@xmath7 ) theory with such large values of @xmath0 . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the value of the infrared fixed point @xmath20 is small : @xmath210.04 ( see below ) . to reach the asymptotically free phase",
    ", one needs to take the bare coupling @xmath16 less than this value of @xmath20 .",
    "however , because of large finite size effects , the lattice computer simulations of the su(3 ) theory with such a small @xmath16 would be unreliable .",
    "therefore , in this case , it is necessary to consider the dynamics with @xmath22 .",
    "the existence of the phase transition with respect to @xmath0 in qcd raises the following question : what are the infrared properties of the qcd @xmath23 function for different @xmath0 and how the @xmath23 function structure reflects the existence of this phase transition ?",
    "i will discuss those issues at the end of my talk but first i will discuss the dynamics in the conformal window of qcd in detail . in particular , i will consider the spectrum of low energy excitations in that dynamics in the presence of a bare fermion mass @xcite .",
    "we will see that in this case , unlike the familiar qcd with a small @xmath0 ( @xmath0=2 or 3 ) , glueballs are much lighter than bound states composed of fermions , if the value of the infrared fixed point is not too large .",
    "another characteristic point is a strong ( and simple ) dependence of the masses of all the colorless bound states on the bare fermion mass , even if the latter is tiny .",
    "this talk is based on papers @xcite .",
    "i begin by recalling the basic facts concerning the two - loop @xmath23 function in an su(@xmath7 ) theory .",
    "the @xmath23 function is @xmath24 with @xcite @xmath25 while these two coefficients are invariant under change of a renormalization scheme , the higher - order coefficients are scheme dependent . actually , there is a renormalization scheme in which the two - loop @xmath23 function is ( perturbatively ) exact @xcite .",
    "we will use such a renormalization scheme .",
    "if @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 , the @xmath23 function has a zero , corresponding to a infrared - stable fixed point , at @xmath29    when @xmath0 is close to @xmath30 , the value of @xmath20 is small .",
    "for example , from eqs.([b ] ) , ( [ c ] ) , and ( [ alpha^ * ] ) , one gets @xmath31 0.04 , 0.14 , 0.28 , and 0.47 for @xmath7=3 and @xmath0=16 , 15 , 14 , and 13 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath20 becomes equal to @xmath32 at @xmath0 close to @xmath33 .",
    "and the fixed point disappears at the value @xmath34 , when the coefficient @xmath35 becomes positive ( @xmath36 is @xmath37 for @xmath7=3 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 function ( [ beta ] ) leads to the following solution for the running coupling : @xmath38 we emphasize that this solution is valid both for @xmath39 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us first consider the case with @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the parameter [ 1 ] @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{lambda}\\ ] ] then , eqs .",
    "( [ solution ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) imply that @xmath41 taking @xmath42 , we find that @xmath43 one may think that @xmath44 plays here the same role as @xmath45 in the confinement phase .",
    "however , as we will see , its physical meaning is somewhat different .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) implies that @xmath46 for @xmath47 ( the usual behavior in asymptotically free theories ) , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , governed by the infrared fixed point @xmath20 .",
    "let us turn to a less familiar case with @xmath22 .",
    "one still can use eq.([solution ] ) .",
    "introduce now the parameter @xmath50 as @xmath51 \\label{tilde}\\ ] ] ( compare with eq.([lambda ] ) ) .",
    "then , eqs.([solution ] ) and ( [ tilde ] ) imply @xmath52 what is the meaning of @xmath50 ? it is a landau pole at which @xmath53 . indeed , taking @xmath54 in eq.([solution2 ] ) , one gets @xmath55 the only solution of this equation is @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of the landau pole implies that the dynamics is not asymptotically free . to get a more insight in this dynamics ,",
    "let us introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath57 with the bare coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "now all momenta @xmath59 satisfy @xmath60 .",
    "eq.([solution2 ] ) implies that at finite @xmath61 , the cutoff @xmath57 is less than @xmath50 , with @xmath56 .",
    "therefore the landau pole is unreachable in the theory with cut off @xmath57 and with @xmath62 .",
    "still one can of course use @xmath50 ( [ tilde ] ) for a convenient parametrization of the running coupling @xmath63 ( see eq.([solution2 ] ) ) .",
    "however , one should remember that momenta @xmath59 satisfy @xmath64 .",
    "eq.([solution2 ] ) implies that @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 when @xmath63 is close to @xmath20 , i.e. when @xmath68 .",
    "thus , now @xmath63 approaches the fixed point @xmath20 from above ( compare with eq.([ir ] ) ) . and",
    ", in general , eq.(11 ) implies that @xmath63 monotonically decrease with @xmath59 , from @xmath69 at @xmath70 to @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "does a meaningful continuum limit exist in this case ?",
    "the answer is of course `` yes '' . as it follows from eq.([solution2 ] ) , when @xmath57 ( and therefore @xmath50 ) goes to infinity , and the bare coupling @xmath17 is arbitrary but fixed , @xmath63 is equal to the fixed value , @xmath71 , for all @xmath73 .",
    "therefore it is a non - trivial conformal field theory .",
    "so far we considered the solution for @xmath63 connected with the perturbative ( and perturbatively exact in the t hooft renormalization scheme @xcite ) @xmath23 function ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "however , unlike ultraviolet stable fixed points , defining dynamics at high momenta , infrared - stable fixed points ( defining dynamics at low momenta ) are very sensitive to nonperturbative dynamics leading to the generation of particle masses .",
    "for example , if fermions acquire a dynamical mass , they decouple from the infrared dynamics , and therefore the perturbative infrared fixed point ( [ alpha^ * ] ) will disappear .    the phase diagram in the ( @xmath74)-plane in this theory was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "the left - hand portion of the curve in this figure coincides with the line of the infrared - stable fixed points @xmath75 in eq.([alpha^ * ] ) .",
    "it separates two symmetric phases , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "its lower end is @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 if @xmath12 ) : at @xmath82 the infrared fixed point is washed out by generating a dynamical fermion mass .",
    "the horizontal , @xmath80 , line describes a phase transition between the symmetric phase @xmath76 and the phase with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "as it was suggested in refs.@xcite , based on a similarity of this phase transition with that in quenched @xmath83 @xcite and in @xmath84 @xcite , there is the following scaling law for @xmath85 : @xmath86 where the constant @xmath87 is of order one and @xmath88 is a scale at which the running coupling is of order @xmath89 .",
    "it is a continuous phase transition with an essential singularity at @xmath80 .",
    "the characteristic point of this phase transition is that the critical line @xmath80 separates phases with essentially different spectra of low energy excitations @xcite and the different structure of the equation for the divergence of the dilatation current ( i.e. with essentially different realizations of the conformal symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "it was called the conformal phase transition in ref.@xcite .    at present",
    "it is still unclear whether the phase transition on the line @xmath80 is indeed a continuous phase transition with an essential singularity or it is a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , anyway , the two properties ( the abrupt change of the spectrum of excitations and the different structure of the equation for the divergence of the dilatation current in those two phases ) have to take place .    at last ,",
    "the right - hand portion of the curve on the diagram occurs because at large enough values of the bare coupling , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking takes place for any number @xmath0 of fermion flavors .",
    "this portion describes a phase transition called a bulk phase transition in the literature , and it is presumably a first order phase transition .",
    "is large enough , is valid at least for lattice theories with kogut - susskind fermions .",
    "notice however that since the bulk phase transition is a lattice artifact , the form of this portion of the curve can depend on the type of fermions used in simulations ( for details , see ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "the vertical line ends above @xmath0=0 since in pure gluodynamics there is apparently no phase transition between weak - coupling and strong - coupling phases .    up to now",
    "we have considered the case of a chiral invariant action . but how will the dynamics change if a bare fermion mass term is added in the action ?",
    "this question is in particular relevant for lattice computer simulations : for studying a chiral phase transition on a finite lattice , it is necessary to introduce a bare fermion mass .",
    "we will show that adding even an arbitrary small bare fermion mass results in a dramatic changing the dynamics both in the @xmath76 and @xmath77 phases .",
    "recall that in the case of confinement su(@xmath7 ) theories , with a small , @xmath10 , number of fermion flavors , the role of a bare fermion mass @xmath90 is minor if @xmath91 ( where @xmath45 is a confinement scale ) .",
    "the only relevant consequence is that massless nambu - goldstone pseudoscalars get a small mass ( the pcac dynamics ) .",
    "the reason for that is the fact that the scale @xmath45 , connected with a scale anomaly , describes the breakdown of the conformal symmetry connected _ both _ with perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics : the running coupling and the formation of bound state .",
    "certainly , a small bare mass @xmath91 is irrelevant for the dynamics of those bound states .",
    "now let us turn to the phase @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath9 . at finite @xmath44 in @xmath76 and @xmath50 in @xmath77 ,",
    "there is still conformal anomaly : because of the running of the effective coupling constant , the conformal symmetry is broken .",
    "it is restored only if @xmath92 in @xmath76 and @xmath93 in @xmath77 . however , the essential difference with respect to confinement theories is that both @xmath44 and @xmath50 have nothing with the dynamics forming bound states : since at @xmath9 the effective coupling is relatively weak , it is impossible to form bound states from @xmath94 fermions and gluons ( recall that the @xmath76 and @xmath77 phases are chiral invariant ) .    therefore the absence of a mass for fermions and gluons is a key point for _ not _ creating bound states in those phases .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if a bare fermion mass is introduced : indeed , even weak gauge , coulomb - like , interactions can easily produce bound states composed of massive constituents , as it happens , for example , in qed , where electron - positron ( positronium ) bound states are present .    to be concrete ,",
    "let us first consider the case when all fermions have the same bare mass @xmath90 .",
    "it leads to a mass function @xmath95 in the fermion propagator @xmath96 .",
    "the current fermion mass @xmath97 is given by the relation @xmath98    for the clearest exposition , let us consider a particular theory with a finite cutoff @xmath57 and the bare coupling constant @xmath99 being not far away from the fixed point @xmath20 .",
    "then , the mass function is changing in the `` walking '' regime @xcite with @xmath100 .",
    "it is @xmath101 where the anomalous dimension @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "eqs.([m ] ) and ( [ m(q ) ] ) imply that @xmath103    there are two main consequences of the presence of the bare mass :    \\(a ) bound states , composed of fermions , occur in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "the mass of a n - body bound state is @xmath104 ;    \\(b ) at momenta @xmath105 , fermions and their bound states decouple .",
    "there is a pure su(@xmath7 ) yang - mills theory with confinement .",
    "its spectrum contains glueballs .    to estimate glueball masses ,",
    "notice that at momenta @xmath105 , the running of the coupling is defined by the parameter @xmath106 of the yang - mills theory , @xmath107 therefore the glueball masses @xmath108 are of order @xmath109    for @xmath18 , we find from eqs.([b ] ) , ( [ c ] ) , and ( [ barb ] ) that @xmath110 is @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath0=16 , 15 , 14 , and 13 , respectively",
    ". therefore at @xmath0=16 , 15 and 14 , the glueball masses are essentially lighter than the masses of the bound states composed of fermions .",
    "the situation is similar to that in confinement qcd with heavy quarks , @xmath115 .",
    "however , there is now a new important point : in the conformal window , _ any _ value of @xmath90 ( and therefore @xmath97 ) is `` heavy '' : the fermion mass @xmath97 sets a new scale in the theory , and the confinement scale @xmath116 ( [ ym ] ) is less , and rather often much less , than this scale @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to a spectacular `` experimental '' signature of the conformal window in lattice computer simulations : glueball masses rapidly , as @xmath117 , decrease with the bare fermion mass @xmath90 for _ all _ values of @xmath90 less than cutoff @xmath57 .",
    "few comments are in order :    \\(1 ) the phases @xmath76 and @xmath77 have essentially the same long distance dynamics .",
    "they are distinguished only by their dynamics at short distances : while the dynamics of the phase @xmath76 is asymptotically free , that of the phase @xmath77 is not .",
    "in particular , when all fermions are massive ( with the current mass @xmath97 ) , the continuum limit @xmath118 of the @xmath77-theory is a non - asymptotically free confinement theory .",
    "its spectrum includes colorless bound states composed of fermions and gluons .",
    "for @xmath119 the running coupling @xmath63 is the same as in pure su(@xmath7 ) yang - mills theory , and for all @xmath120 @xmath63 is very close to @xmath20 ( `` walking '' , actually , `` standing '' dynamics ) . for those values @xmath0 for which @xmath20 is small ( as @xmath0=16 , 15 and 14 at @xmath7=3 ) , glueballs are much lighter than the bound states composed of fermions .",
    "notice that , unlike the case with @xmath121 , there exists an s - matrix in this theory .",
    "\\(2 ) in order to get the clearest exposition , we assumed such estimates as @xmath81 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the anomalous dimension @xmath124 . while the latter should be reasonable for @xmath125 ( and especially for @xmath126 ) @xcite , the former is based on the assumption that @xmath127 which , though seems reasonable , might be crude for some values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear however that the dynamical picture presented in this paper is essentially independent of those assumptions .",
    "\\(3 ) so far we have considered the case when all fermions have the same bare mass @xmath90 . the generalization to the case",
    "when different fermions may have different bare masses is evident .",
    "\\(4 ) lattice computer simulations of the su(3 ) theory with a relatively large number of @xmath0 @xcite indeed indicate on the existence of a symmetric phase .",
    "however , the value of the critical number @xmath122 is different in different simulations : it varies from @xmath128 @xcite through @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "i hope that the signature of the conformal window considered in this talk can be useful to settle this important issue .",
    "how does the structure of the qcd @xmath23 function reflect the existence of the phase transition with respect to @xmath0 ?",
    "this problem has been addressed in the work @xcite .",
    "the impetus for that work was the structure of the @xmath23 function of the @xmath130 susy gluodynamics which is known exactly if no matter fields are present @xcite : @xmath131 ; \\;\\;x\\equiv\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}. \\label{nsvz}\\ ] ]    this structure shows the following two noticeable features :    \\a ) eq.([nsvz ] ) implies that , besides the conventional asymptotically free phase with @xmath132 , there exists a strong ultraviolet phase in which the coupling @xmath133 is greater than the @xmath23-function pole at @xmath134 @xcite . in that phase ,",
    "the value @xmath135 is an ultraviolet fixed point . as in the case of the infrared fixed point considered in the previous section ,",
    "these two phases share common infrared properties . because of that",
    ", the @xmath23-function pole is called an infrared attractor . unlike theories with an infrared fixed point , theories with an infrared attractor correspond to the confinement phase .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we addressed whether pad - summations of the @xmath136 qcd @xmath23 function for a given number of flavors exhibit an infrared fixed point , or alternatively , an infrared attractor .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "below an approximant - dependent flavor threshold @xmath137 , the pad - summation @xmath23 functions incorporating @xmath138 , [ 1|2 ] , [ 2|2 ] , [ 1|3]$ ] , and @xmath139 $ ] approximants whose maclaurin expansions match known higher - than - one - loop contributions to the @xmath23-function series always exhibit a positive pole prior to the occurrence of their first positive zero , precluding any identification of this first positive zero as an infrared fixed point .",
    "this result is shown to be true regardless of the magnitude of the presently - unknown five - loop @xmath23-function contribution explicitly appearing within pad - summation @xmath23 functions incorporating @xmath140 , [ 1|3]$ ] , and @xmath139 $ ] approximants . like in the case of supersymmetric gluodynamics",
    ", the pole in question suggests the occurrence of dynamics in which both a strong and an asymptotically free phase share a common infrared attractor . as @xmath0 increases above an approximant - dependent flavor threshold , pad - summation @xmath23 functions exhibit dynamics controlled by an infrared fixed point .",
    "this fixed point decreases in magnitude with increasing flavor number .    thus utilizing pad - summation qcd @xmath23 functions",
    ", we obtain a good degree of agreement with infrared properties predicted @xcite via the t hooft renormalization scheme @xcite in which the @xmath23 function is truncated subsequent to two - loop order .",
    "it is noticeable that the infrared structure of the @xmath23 function we obtained in qcd with a small number of flavors is similar to that of the @xmath23 function in susy gluodynamics : there are strong arguments in the literature in the support of essentially the same mechanism of confinement in those theories .",
