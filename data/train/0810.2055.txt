    "to find the structural ground state of a cluster is a non - trivial global optimization task .",
    "one has to find the global minimum of the potential energy surface which is a function of all the atomic coordinates . even for a relatively small cluster of 30 atoms the configuration space has already 90 dimensions . because knowing the structure is a prerequisite for the study of all other physical and chemical properties the problem is of great importance and many algorithms have been developed to solve this global optimization problem .",
    "we compare _ evolutionary algorithms _ which have successfully been used in many diverse fields with the _ minima hopping _  @xcite method .",
    "for the prediction of the ground state structure of crystals , the _ uspex ( universal structure predictor : evolutionary xtallography ) _",
    "@xcite method has turned out to be extremely powerful and has already allowed material scientists to find interesting and unexpected new crystal structures  @xcite .",
    "recently evolutionary algorithms have also been successfully used to predict surface phenomena such as steps on silicon crystals  @xcite .",
    "a widespread application of global optimization methods is the prediction of the structure of various clusters , in this field the majority of the work has been done with genetic or evolutionary methods as well  @xcite .",
    "we note that different evolutionary algorithms developed for various types of structure prediction problems ( molecules , clusters , crystals ) have significant differences . even for the same type of problem ( e.g. crystal structure prediction ) the previously proposed algorithms are very different in their construction and performance .",
    "the minima hopping method has been successfully applied to benchmark systems  @xcite as well as to silicon clusters and afm tips  @xcite .",
    "the presented evolutionary algorithm is similar to and inspired by the structure prediction algorithm uspex .",
    "but since we work with non - periodic systems without a crystal lattice , some modifications of the original method were required .",
    "the version of minima hopping we are using is based on an improvement of the two key features of the original minima hopping method  @xcite .",
    "the feedback mechanism is enhanced and the bell - evans - polanyi principle  @xcite is exploited in a more efficient way by moving preferentially along soft directions in the molecular dynamics ( md ) part of the minima hopping algorithm .",
    "our comparison of minima hopping and evolutionary algorithms is based on lennard - jones systems , especially the cluster with @xmath3 atoms , which is an example of an easy one - funnel structure , and the @xmath4-atom system , which is known to have a complicated double - funnel structure .",
    "we also apply the algorithms to more realistic systems , namely silicon clusters described by a force field and gold clusters described by an embedded atom potential .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we first introduce the evolutionary method used , after a quick introduction to minima hopping and its modifications we present the results section containing a comparison between minima hopping and the evolutionary algorithm and finally we also test different aspects of the ea and mh .",
    "evolutionary algorithms ( ea ) implement a very simple model of biological evolution .",
    "they work on a set of samples  a _ population _  which is gradually improved by selection and reproduction of fit members of the population  _",
    "individuals_. each individual is a solution candidate .",
    "a single iteration step leads from a population to the next and is called a _ generation_.",
    "the algorithm optimizes the _ fitness _ function  in our context the negative energy of the configuration .",
    "the operators applied to the population to obtain the next generation are the heart of the algorithm as they determine its quality and properties .",
    "in contrast to the original simple genetic algorithm , modern applications in the field of chemical structure prediction all use real value encoding instead of binary strings and phenotypical operators acting directly in real space instead of gene modification  @xcite .",
    "also state of the art is the application of local optimization to each individual thus reducing the search space to basin bottoms .",
    "local optimization is done using standard techniques such as steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] presents an overview of the evolutionary algorithm used .",
    "it starts with a randomly initialized population , this is our generation @xmath5 . in each generation",
    "the algorithm goes through three steps : _ selection _ , _ application of operators _ and _ acceptance_. the steps _ selection + operator _",
    "produce new offspring and mutations and put them into an intermediate population . in _ acceptance _",
    "the next generation is selected out of all available offspring together with individuals from the old population .",
    "is evolved into the next generation @xmath6 using mutation and recombination operators .",
    "@xmath7 : elitism ( number of individuals kept from the old generation ) .",
    "@xmath8 : total number of offspring produced .",
    "@xmath9 : population size.,width=302 ]    the algorithm possesses many tunable parameters .",
    "most important values are populationsize , the number of offspring produced , the number of individuals kept from the last generation ( elitism ) and the mutationrate , for a complete list see table  [ tbl : parameterlist ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     minima hopping has been considerably improved using _ softening _ , in all studied cases .",
    "the use of enhanced feedback method is advantageous in large or multi - funneled systems but can even have a negative effect in easy systems as lj@xmath10 ( table  [ tbl : soften ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 in ( [ eqn : enhfb ] ) should not be chosen too large .",
    "we used softening and enhanced feedback with @xmath12 in the comparison runs .",
    "we have tested an evolutionary algorithm capable of finding ground state structures of atomic clusters . in spite of the success of ea for periodic systems and on surfaces",
    "the current evolutionary algorithm is overall less efficient than minima hopping in the current implementation .",
    "it is not yet able to find global minima with geometrically difficult structures such as elongated silicon clusters and non - icosahedral ground states without the concept of niches .",
    "in contrast , minima hopping was able to find all ground states . where the ea succeeds its performance is comparable to or even better than that of mh .",
    "further improvements of the ea could make it superior to mh for cluster optimization if the specifics of cluster systems are taken into account , as it was already done for periodic systems in the uspex algorithm .",
    "the mh algorithm , on the other hand , shows a high stability and little need for further adaptation , at least for homoatomic systems ."
