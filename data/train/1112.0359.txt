    "the discovery of short - period , giant extrasolar planets @xcite provided the exciting potential for large numbers of planets to be discovered by the transit method , as these `` hot jupiters '' have a @xmath310% geometric probability of transiting , and do so every few days .",
    "however early predictions greatly overestimated the actual discovery rate @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy resulted from simplistic assumptions and a misunderstanding of the effects that systematic noise would play in lowering detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "it also resulted from an over - estimation of the frequency of hot jupiters .",
    "more accurate , and lower , predictions were provided in @xcite , where it was noted that objective and quantifiable detection criteria were required for more robust inferences of planet frequencies . by adopting such objective and quantifiable detection criteria ,",
    "we propose that the frequency of hot jupiters in the field has been overestimated by a factor of three @xcite .",
    "the superlupus survey was established to detect hot jupiters in a field positioned just above the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ) , and also to determine the fraction of stars that host hot jupiters in this typical galactic field .",
    "the survey design and data analysis was constructed so as to fulfill both of these objectives .    in section  [ observations ] of this paper",
    ", we describe the superlupus observations and data reduction .",
    "the photometry is described in section  [ photometry ] .",
    "the criteria for candidate selection are detailed in section  [ sec : detection ] , and the 10 identified candidates are described and analyzed in section  [ sec : candidates ] .    in section  [ mc_simulatinos ]",
    ", we set out the details of the monte carlo simulations performed to calculate the detection efficiency and the effective number of stars probed for planets in the superlupus survey . in section  [ frequency ] , we apply this efficiency to the actual results of the survey to determine the fraction of stars in the field that host a hot jupiter .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we summarize and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "the superlupus survey is an extension of the lupus survey @xcite , in which the duration of the original survey was approximately doubled to provide sensitivity to transiting planets with periods as long as 10  days .",
    "many details of the data reduction procedure are set out elsewhere @xcite ; here we summarize the procedure and highlight aspects that differed between the lupus and superlupus projects .    both surveys monitored a single field using the wide - field imager on the anu 40-inch telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "the field , in the constellation of lupus , is 11@xmath5 above the galactic plane centered at r.a.@xmath615@xmath730@xmath836.3@xmath9 , decl.@xmath6@xmath1042@xmath553@xmath1153.0@xmath12 ( j2000 ) . in total , 5158 images of 300  s exposure were taken in a custom ( @xmath13+@xmath14 ) filter . of these ,",
    "2801 images were from the original lupus survey ( 2005 and 2006 ) and an additional 2357 new images were taken in 2008 .",
    "the average full - width half - maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) over all 5158 images is 2.02 .",
    "initial data reduction ( bias , dark , and flatfield correction ) was carried out on the mosaic frames using standard iraf tasks in the package mscred .",
    "sky flats were obtained at twilight whenever conditions permitted , and master flatfields were produced by median combining the @xmath330 sky flats most proximate in time to each night .",
    "bad pixels and columns were masked and the mosaic frames were split into individual ccd frames .",
    "a world coordinate system solution was calculated for each image in order to identify stars for photometry .",
    "photometry for the original lupus survey was performed using difference imaging analysis ( dia : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the superlupus survey , we instead used source extractor aperture photometry .",
    "this approach was motivated by the fact that many of the survey images have psfs that are asymmetric due to tracking or focusing issues .",
    "such psfs can cause potential problems for dia photometry , but are not of concern for aperture photometry as long as the photometric aperture is large enough .",
    "initial tests revealed that aperture photometry could achieve the same ( and even better ) photometric precision for the majority of the brighter stars ( @xmath15 ) in the field .",
    "in fact we note that the final superlupus aperture photometry resulted in approximately 10@xmath16 more stars with a root - mean - squared ( rms ) variability less than 0.025  mag compared with the original lupus survey using dia .",
    "we found that a photometric aperture radius of 10 pixels ( 3.75 ) resulted in the highest precision lightcurves for the majority of these stars .",
    "a reference catalog of 50,907 target stars ( @xmath15 ) was produced from a single , high quality , reference image .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on these stars for each survey image , with apertures re - centered on the point of peak flux for each star in each image .",
    "background subtraction was performed using a background map produced for each image by median filtering and bi - cubic - spline interpolation over a 8@xmath178 pixel grid .",
    "systematic trends in the resulting lightcurves were removed using the sys - rem algorithm @xcite with 12 iterations . to further refine this dataset , we removed stars with lightcurves that displayed rms variability greater than 0.05  mag .",
    "we also discarded poor quality images as described below . in total",
    "this left us with 26,859 stars over 3585 images .      to identify poor quality images",
    ", we define an image quality metric ( @xmath18 ) as : @xmath19 where for the @xmath20 star on the @xmath21 image , @xmath22 is the average subtracted residual magnitude and @xmath23 is the photometric uncertainty .",
    "this metric is computed in the sys - rem algorithm , where linear systematic effects are removed in order to minimise @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in essence , @xmath18 is a measure of how all the stars in image @xmath24 vary from the mean of all images in the survey .",
    "we retained only those images with @xmath25 for searching for planetary transits .",
    "the advantage of using this metric is that it uses information from all stars over the chip in a single quality factor that is directly related to the precision of the resulting stellar photometry .",
    "this image quality metric also proved useful to determine if transit candidates were statistical false positives by looking for correlations between `` transit '' events and @xmath18 ( see section  [ sec : candidates ] ) .",
    "in order to accurately determine the efficiency of the superlupus survey , candidates must be identified in an automated and systematic manner that can be applied identically to synthetic lightcurves in the monte carlo simulation ( see section  [ mc_simulatinos ] ) .",
    "this was implemented by way of a set of six selection criteria that were automatically applied to each processed lightcurve .",
    "initially all 26,859 superlupus lightcurves were searched for transit events using the box - fitting least - squares ( bls ) algorithm .",
    "trial periods in the range @xmath26  d were tested with 55,000 equally - spaced frequency steps and 200 phase bins per trial frequency .",
    "candidates were then identified based on their bls signal detection efficiency ( @xmath27 ) , as defined in . after testing synthetic lightcurves with the same temporal and noise characteristics as our data , a candidate threshold value of @xmath28 was adopted .",
    "we defined the effective signal - to - noise of the detected transit event , @xmath29 , for all candidates , as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bls - determined transit depth , @xmath32 is the rms variability of the entire ( sys - rem corrected ) lightcurve , and @xmath33 is the actual number of data points within the bls - determined transit event , i.e. the number of `` in - transit '' data points .",
    "a threshold of @xmath34 was adopted , identical to the threshold adopted in two other transit surveys of faint stars @xcite . at this stage",
    "we also rejected candidates for which more than 90% of in - transit data originated from an event on a single night .",
    "as with other ground - based surveys , many of our candidates displayed integer - day periods resulting from nightly systematic effects . therefore candidates with @xmath35 and @xmath36 were rejected .",
    "we also required that candidates had a magnitude of @xmath37 .",
    "finally candidates were cross - matched with the catalog of known variable stars in the field @xcite and eclipsing binary systems were removed .",
    "the selection criteria are summarized in table  [ tab : criteria ] .",
    "a total of 10 lightcurves fulfilled the six selection criteria set out in section  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "their characteristics are described in table  [ tab : candidates ] .    the candidate sl-07 was immediately recognised as lupus - tr-3 , a star with a transiting planet that had been discovered during the original lupus survey @xcite . to investigate the likely nature of the other candidates , we used the @xmath38 diagnostic method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the results are set out in table  [ tab : candidates2 ] .",
    "candidates sl-02 and sl-04 show very high diagnostic numbers , indicating that their transit parameters make them unlikely to be real transiting planets . in the case of candidate",
    "sl-04 , a very clear transit was observed on 6 june 2005 , with a transit time of approximately 6  hr , in contrast to the bls determined duration of 8.08  hr .",
    "use of the shorter duration reduces the @xmath38 diagnostic value to 1.9 , which , while still high , could be explained by a large radius planet , since the @xmath38 diagnostic is normalized to the assumption @xmath39 .    to help identify statistical false positives , we checked if the detected transit event was correlated with the image quality , using the calculated value of the metric @xmath18 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sj ] ) .",
    "three candidates , sl-08 , sl-09 and sl-10 , were found to have transit events that were strongly correlated with @xmath18 , indicating that the detected transit signature is almost certainly a systematic effect that the sys - rem algorithm had not fully removed .",
    "an example of such a correlation is shown in figure  [ fig : correlation ] .",
    "we inspected the images of the candidates for signs that the transit signature might be caused by proximity to the edge of a ccd , a bad column , or a bright star .",
    "we also inspected the image for evidence of significant flux contributions from neighboring stars within the photometric aperture .",
    "sl-01 was found to be blended with a very bright , saturated neighboring star at a distance of 27 .",
    "we therefore ruled this out as being a genuine candidate .",
    "we found that the candidate sl-03 had three neighbors close to the photometric aperture , and that sl-05 had a neighbor well within the photometric aperture .",
    "photometry for these candidates was re - derived using a smaller photometric aperture to avoid the contaminating neighbors .",
    "this analysis revealed that the transit event seen in sl-05 was in fact due to a very deep eclipse ( 40% ) occurring in a faint neighbour situated just @xmath40 from sl-05 .",
    "it also revealed that while the sl-03 target star was responsible for the observed transit event , close neighbors and the large aperture of the original photometry had diluted the size of the dip from the true depth of 0.100  mag to a shallower 0.042  mag .",
    "the true depth is characteristic of an eclipsing binary and does not pass our selection criterion .    in summary , we conclude that of the 10 candidates identified in the superlupus survey , only sl-07 can be confirmed as a genuine transiting planet .",
    "we rule out seven candidates ( sl-01 , sl-02 , sl-03 , sl-05 , sl-08 , sl-09 , sl-10 ) as being false positives , while two candidates ( sl-04 and sl-06 ) remain .",
    "these two remaining candidates are v=17.8 and v=18.6 respectively , making follow - up extremely difficult .",
    "consequently , we have not observed these candidates further , although formally we can not exclude them . in section  [ frequency ]",
    "we calculate hot jupiter frequencies assuming only sl-07 is a transiting planet , but also provide figures for the case where one of these remaining candidates is a transiting planet .",
    "to determine the efficiency of the superlupus survey to detecting transiting planets , we carried out a monte carlo simulation of the superlupus survey .",
    "synthetic transit signatures were inserted into actual superlupus lightcurves and then recovery attempted using the same methodology and selection criteria used for our survey .",
    "generating a realistic set of synthetic transit lightcurves against which to test a detection algorithm requires knowledge of the actual distribution of transit depths , durations , and periods of transiting planets .",
    "ideally , this would be achieved by determining the radius of each monitored star in the field .",
    "this is possible when monitoring an equidistant population such as an open cluster or a globular cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the distances to field stars can not be determined from photometry alone , the exact radius of each star in the superlupus field is unknown .",
    "we therefore used the beasonon model of the galaxy to provide a statistical distribution of stellar radii and masses for the stars monitored in our field .",
    "the population was synthesized over a 0.66  deg@xmath41 field centered at @xmath42 .",
    "interstellar extinction was set at 0.6  magkpc@xmath43 , based on the schlegel dust maps of the region @xcite .",
    "stars were selected in the magnitude range @xmath44 to match the superlupus observational and selection constraints .",
    "the beasonon model returned a population of stars that closely matched both the total star count , and the distribution of apparent magnitudes ( see figure  [ fig : beasoncon ] ) , giving us confidence this model accurately simulates our field .",
    "we note that the beasonon model indicated that 24% of the survey stars have @xmath45 . in our monte carlo",
    "these stars are classified as giants and given zero probability for transit detection .",
    "we assign a radius to each star in the simulation based on the stellar mass from the beasanon model and the simple relationship given by @xcite :    @xmath46      lightcurves for the monte carlo were created by first randomly selecting a star from the beasanon model population .",
    "the temporal sampling of the star is set to the actual timestamps of the superlupus survey .",
    "we then need to attach an appropriate photometric uncertainty to each point on the synthetic curve .",
    "this was done by using the @xmath13 magnitude of the chosen star to randomly select an rms uncertainty from the actual distributions in rms observed in the superlupus survey for stars of that @xmath13 magnitude , as described below .    the rms scatter for each real lightcurve in the superlupus survey , after the application of sys - rem , shows a wide range in rms scatter at a given @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "therefore we calculated the actual distribution of rms scatter for each @xmath13  magnitude in the survey , as displayed in figure  [ fig : rms - density ] .",
    "as an example , the distribution for @xmath47 is shown in figure  [ fig : rms_scatter_dist ] .",
    "it can be thought of as a vertical slice through the density plot in figure  [ fig : rms - density ] .",
    "it is evident that the rms scatter distributions are non - gaussian , with long tails towards high rms scatter .",
    "this further highlights the importance of basing the rms scatter of synthetic lightcurves on the actual distributions of photometric precision rather than approximating them using a single - valued function of magnitude as has been done in some previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a value for the photometric precision",
    "is selected randomly , using the appropriate rms scatter distribution as a probability weighting , for each beasonon star .",
    "once the value of the photometric precision is determined , a real superlupus lightcurve is selected with the same photometric precision , and used as the base lightcurve into which we inject a transit .      to simulate the lightcurve from a transiting hot jupiter",
    ", we first determined the parameters for each simulated system .",
    "the stellar mass and radius were taken from the beasonon model and eq .",
    "[ eq : mass - radius ] .",
    "the planetary mass was fixed at @xmath48 , but we note that this does not significantly alter the transit parameters when @xmath49 .",
    "four different planetary radii were simulated : @xmath50 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , and 1.4  @xmath51 .",
    "the inclination of the orbit , @xmath52 , was determined by choosing a random @xmath53 between zero and @xmath54 , the limiting inclination that results in a transit @xcite :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the planet s semi - major orbital axis .",
    "although there is some evidence for a `` pile - up '' of planets at @xmath33  day periods @xcite , the intrinsic distribution of planets with periods between 1 - 10  days is not well understood .",
    "therefore it is necessary to make an assumption in assigning the period distribution in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xcite use a uniform logarithmic distribution .",
    "we test this distribution , as well as a uniform linear distribution in period .    with the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 assigned to each star ,",
    "a transit depth and duration was calculated and a box - shaped transit inserted into each synthetic lightcurve .",
    "for each parameter set , we simulated 10 randomly - selected phases .",
    "we adopted a simple box - shape model as limb darkening effects have been shown to be negligible in this signal - to - noise regime @xcite .",
    "the transits were inserted into lightcurves that had already been detrended using sys - rem , whereas a transit signal in our survey would need to pass through the sys - rem detrending .",
    "we therefore carefully tested and optimised the number of sys - rem iterations we used so that we would not degrade a real astrophysical signal . only those trends that are present in many light curves with the same temporal timestamps",
    "are removed .",
    "the bls algorithm was applied to each synthetic lightcurve , using the same parameters used for the actual superlupus dataset ( see section  [ sec : detection ] ) . in total ,",
    "800,000 lightcurves were generated for the monte carlo and searched for transit signatures .",
    "transits were deemed to be detected if the selection criteria used in the actual superlupus search ( see section  [ sec : detection ] ) were satisfied .",
    "the detection efficiency , @xmath63 , is defined as the fraction of lightcurves in which the inserted transit signal is detected in the monte carlo simulation : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a delta function representing whether the transit of star @xmath52 is detected ( @xmath66 ) or not detected ( @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 is the number of simulated stars in the monte carlo simulation . as discussed in section  [ sec : besancon ] , 24@xmath16 of our survey stars are giants ( @xmath69 ) , and were automatically assigned a @xmath67 regardless of the other system parameters .",
    "we also note that only transiting systems were simulated , so @xmath63 does not include the geometric probability of transit .    to determine the frequency of hot jupiters in the field of the superlupus survey we need to determine how many dwarf stars we have effectively probed for transiting planets , @xmath70 .",
    "this number depends on the geometric probability of transit , the number of stars monitored to a given precision ( for superlupus this is 20,465 ) , as well as the detection efficiency .",
    "we calculated the geometric probability of transit , @xmath71 , for each system generated in our monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xmath70 is therefore given as :    @xmath72    both the detection efficiency and the effective number of dwarf stars probed are set out in table  [ tab : montecarlo ] for a variety of period ranges and assumed period distributions of hot jupiters .",
    "also tabulated are the mean transit depth , transit duration , and mean transit probability for each set of monte carlo assumptions about the size and period distribution of hot jupiters .",
    "the results are presented for all periods simulated ( 1 - 10  days ) , as well as for period ranges of 1 - 3  days , 3 - 5  days , and 5 - 10  days in order to allow for direct comparison with the results of @xcite and @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : survey_eff ] , @xmath70 is plotted as a function of planet radii for each of the four planetary radii simulated . as expected ,",
    "more stars are probed in all period ranges for large radii planets , and more stars are probed for shorter period planets . the difference between the uniform and uniform logarithmic period distributions is most marked for the 1 - 3  d period planets .",
    "the frequency of dwarf stars that host hot jupiter planets , @xmath73 , can be calculated simply using the monte carlo results and the superlupus survey results : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of planets detected in the survey .    with only one ( or possibly two ) planets detected",
    ", poisson statistics are used to determine confidence intervals , or upper limits in the cases of no planet detections .",
    "the probability of detecting @xmath75 planets when @xmath76 planets are expected is : @xmath77 since the underlying distribution of planets is unknown , a bayesian approach is used , with a flat prior for the uniform distribution , and a log prior for the logarithmic distribution .",
    "the upper and lower 90% confidence intervals ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively ) are calculated by solving : @xmath80 the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 were determined numerically from eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson_twoside ] , with a symmetric confidence interval such that 5% of the probability distribution was below @xmath79 and 5% above @xmath78 .",
    "the limits @xmath78 and @xmath79 were then used to calculate the upper and low limits for 90% confidence intervals .    where no planets were detected in a period range , a one - sided 95% confidence upper limit is used so that it can be directly compared with the two - sided 90% limits . in that case ,",
    "@xmath81 , and eq .  [ eq : poisson_twoside ] simplifies to : @xmath82 this method of calculating confidence limits is similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the follow - up work presented in @xcite reveals that one of the superlupus candidates , sl-07 , is indeed a hot jupiter planet .",
    "seven other candidates can be ruled out as false positives , while sl-04 and sl-06 remain as candidates , although follow - up would be difficult due to their faintness .",
    "we therefore present our frequency results for the case where lupus - tr-3b is the only transiting planet detected ( @xmath83 ) and also for the case where either sl-04 or sl-06 is also a transiting planet ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the results are set out in table  [ tab : freq_sl ] , again for both uniform and uniform logrithmic period distributions , and are tabulated in the same period ranges as used in table  [ tab : montecarlo ] .",
    "frequencies for each of the four simulated planet radii are calculated , along with the mean over these radii , which is @xmath85 .      there are four other transit studies of non - cluster fields that report statistics for hot jupiter frequency .",
    "the _ kepler mission _",
    "@xcite yields very high precision , near continiuos photometry for around 150,000 target stars in a selected galactic field .",
    "@xcite calculate the the frequency of planets within 0.25au of solar - type hosts stars selected from the kepler target stars . for the period range of 1.2@xmath86p@xmath8610  d , and radii 0.7@xmath871.4 ,",
    "very similiar to those considered in this work , the frequency of hot jupiters is given as 0.37@xmath16 ( figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "this frequency is based only on `` solar type '' kepler target stars , defined as those with temperatures of @xmath88  k and gravities of @xmath89 .",
    "while this gravity cut is essentially the same as is used in this work , the temperature cut means that a more limited sample of stars are being probed .",
    "coupled with the fact that these stars are already drawn from a set of targets selected using `` detectability metrics '' that suggested they were most likely to give a detectable transit signal for terrestrial - size planets @xcite , the frequency of 0.37@xmath16 is higher than one might expect for ground based survey of random galactic dwarfs in the field . indeed the kepler result is at the high end of the frequency of hot jupiters determined from our superlupus survey , just consistent within our uncertainty .",
    "the mmt transit survey of the open cluster m37 @xcite included a significant number of non - cluster field stars , and these were analyzed separately to determine the hot jupiter frequency for galactic dwarf stars .",
    "assuming a jupiter - sized planet , and a logarithmic period distribution , that study found that the fraction of field stars hosting planets with periods of 1 - 3  d is @xmath860.8% , and those with planets having periods of 3 - 5  d is @xmath862.7% .",
    "these statistics are upper limits only , as there were no confirmed transiting planets",
    ".    analysis of the ogle - iii survey for transiting planets puts the frequency of hot jupiters at 0.14% for 1 - 3  d period planets , and 0.31% for periods of 3 - 5",
    "these statistics draw on survey fields in both the galactic plane and the galactic bulge , and were derived based on five transiting planets that had been confirmed from the ogle - iii survey .",
    "they rely on an estimation of the efficiency of the `` by - eye '' selection that was used by the ogle team to select transiting planet candidates .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) was used to undertake a survey for transiting planets in the crowded bulge region of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "sixteen candidates were discovered from a sample of 180,000 stars monitored , however only one of these ( sweeps-11 ) was bright enough to be confirmed in the usual manner using radial velocity measurements .",
    "assuming that all the candidates are indeed planets , it was reported that 0.42% of bulge stars more massive than @xmath90 have giant planets with periods up to 4.2  days @xcite .",
    "our result for 1 - 3  d period planets , @xmath91 , is consistent with the limits from the deep mmt survey of @xcite . it is lower than the ogle results , but consistent within the lower half of their 90% confidence interval . for 3 - 5  d period planets ,",
    "our result of @xmath92 is consistent with the upper limit from the deep mmt survey .",
    "it is lower than the ogle results , but still within the 90% confidence intervals . for 5 - 10  d periods",
    "we are able to place limits on the frequency of hot jupiters of @xmath93 , assuming a logarithmic distribution in period and also that sl-04 and sl-06 do not host genuine hot jupiters .",
    "if one of these candidates is a transiting hot jupiter this frequency in this period range would be @xmath94 , closer to the kepler figure of 0.37% but still lower than the rv survey results .",
    "the comparisons are summarised in table  [ tab : fraction ] .",
    "the frequency of hot jupiters can also be determined from radial velocity surveys .",
    "@xcite report a frequency of @xmath95 from the keck planet search , while @xcite report a frequency of @xmath96 from the elodie planet search .",
    "these comparisons are also set out in table  [ tab : fraction ] .",
    "both of these radial velocity results are above our upper 90% confidence interval ( 0.56% ) , although the confidence intervals of the two survey results overlap .",
    "there are , however , major differences between transit surveys and these radial velocity surveys that could lead to discrepancies in the frequency derived for hot jupiters . radial velocity surveys",
    "are sensitive to planetary mass , while transit surveys are sensitive to planetary radius .",
    "also transit and radial velocity surveys usually monitor different stellar populations .",
    "radial velocity surveys typically monitor carefully selected bright , sun - like stars .",
    "more recently , bright m dwarfs have also been monitored .",
    "transit searches monitor every star in the survey field that has the requisite signal - to - noise to yield high precision photometry . in a deep survey such as the superlupus survey",
    ", this will translate to a stellar population with a sub - solar mean mass ( 0.9@xmath97 in the case of the superlupus survey ) .",
    "if hot jupiters of a given period are less frequent around lower mass stars , then the frequency of hot jupiters from deep transit surveys will be lower than radial velocity surveys .",
    "the frequency of hot jupiters in the galaxy is an important quantity that will ultimately provide a constraint on models of planet formation and migration .",
    "it has been suggested that the frequency of hot jupiters in globular cluster environments is lower than that of field stars , and that this may be due to crowding or low metallicity affecting planet formation , migration , or survival @xcite .",
    "our results indicate , however , that there is little statistical disagreement between hot jupiter frequencies in cluster and non - cluster environments , even if one of the remaining candidates turns out to be a genuine planet .",
    "this is consistent with the work presented in @xcite which concludes that there is no evidence to support that open clusters have a lower frequency of hot jupiters .",
    "initial estimates for planet yields from transit surveys turned out to be far in excess of the actual discovery rate @xcite .",
    "one of the many factors that led to this over - estimation was the adoption of the hot jupiter frequency derived from early radial velocity surveys , which as we have shown is higher than is found from transit surveys .",
    "the _ kepler _ result of 0.37@xmath16 @xcite obviously provides a robust statistic for hot jupiter frequencies due to the high detection efficiency of that survey .",

    "<S> we present the results of the superlupus survey for transiting hot jupiter planets , which monitored a single galactic disk field spanning 0.66 deg@xmath0 for 108 nights over three years . </S>",
    "<S> ten candidates were detected : one is a transiting planet , two remain candidates , and seven have been subsequently identified as false positives . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a new image quality metric , @xmath1 , based on the behaviour of 26,859 light curves , which allows us to discard poor images in an objective and quantitative manner . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in some cases we are able to identify statistical false positives by analysing temporal correlations between @xmath1 and transit signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we use monte carlo simulations to measure our detection efficiency by injecting artificial transits onto real light curves and applying identical selection criteria as used in our survey . </S>",
    "<S> we find at 90% confidence level that 0.10@xmath2% of dwarf stars host a hot jupiter with a period of 1 - 10  days . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with other transit surveys , but appear consistently lower than the hot jupiter frequencies reported from radial velocity surveys , a difference we attribute , at least in part , to the difference in stellar populations probed . in light of our determination of the frequency of hot jupiters in galactic field stars , previous null results for transiting planets in open cluster and globular cluster surveys no longer appear anomalously low . </S>"
