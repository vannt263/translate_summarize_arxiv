    "i have been asked to speak about s isochrone model .",
    "this was covered in three papers , submitted to ann ap in french between may 1958 and november 1959 @xcite .",
    "the first of these papers is by far the most non - trivial . in it",
    "derives the isochrone potential as the most general spherical potential in which the radial period is independent of angular momentum at a given energy . since this paper appeared in french and has a subtle line of argumentation i have decided to allocate a good deal of space to reproducing , and i hope clarifying , its argument .",
    "the other two papers are much more straightforward and i will not cover them in detail . instead i will describe the impact that the isochrone model has had on my research over many years .",
    "in particular i will describe the role the isochrone potential plays in torus mapping , and a family of flattened isochrone models which i have recently published .",
    "i believe these applications will ensure that s isochrone plays a significant role in astrophysics throughout the coming decade .",
    "the paper of may 1958 @xcite points out that the gravitational potentials of both a homogeneous mass distribution and a point mass have the property that the radial period @xmath0 of an orbit depends on the orbit s energy @xmath1 alone : all orbits of a given value of @xmath1 have the same value of @xmath0 , irrespective of their angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "asks `` what is the most general gravitational potential for which this property holds ? ''",
    "he writes down the integral @xmath3 that determines @xmath0 and makes a change of variable to @xmath4 .",
    "then the integral becomes @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "he plots the curve @xmath7 defined by the potential and points out that the argument of the radical on the bottom of ( [ eq : tr ] ) is the vertical distance between this curve and the straight line @xmath8 .",
    "increasing @xmath2 has the effect of moving the straight line down , and at a critical value @xmath9 the line touches the convex curve @xmath7 at @xmath10 ( ) . introduces a new independent variable @xmath11 through @xmath12 along with the convention that @xmath13 when @xmath14 and @xmath15 when @xmath16 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath17 is the vertical distance between the tangent @xmath18 and the the curve @xmath7 . for @xmath19 the line @xmath8 intersects the curve @xmath7 twice : at @xmath20 and at @xmath21 .",
    "these points of intersection are implicitly defined by the equation @xmath22     and @xmath23 . ]",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the vertical distance between the two straight lines in , and at @xmath25 @xmath26 and at @xmath27 @xmath28 .    with these definitions",
    "the integral for @xmath0 can be rewritten @xmath29 this integral suggests the substitution @xmath30 so @xmath31  now introduces @xmath32 so @xmath33 and @xmath0 becomes @xmath34 in terms of the maclaurin expansion of @xmath35 @xmath36 equation ( [ eq : tr2 ] ) becomes @xmath37 none of the odd - numbered terms in the series makes a contribution to @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is to be independent of @xmath2 , it must be independent of @xmath38 ( eq .  [ eq : defslam ] ) , so the function @xmath39 must have vanishing coefficients @xmath40 : its even part must consist only of the constant @xmath41 , which specifies @xmath0 through @xmath42    integrating equation ( [ eq : defsf ] ) we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the even function of @xmath11 that is obtained by integrating the odd part of @xmath39 . if we subtract the values taken by this expression at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 because at these points @xmath48 . squaring this expression and recalling the definition ( [ eq : defslam ] ) of @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath49 where @xmath50    the points @xmath25 , @xmath27 are functions of both @xmath1 ( which determines the slopes of the lines in and @xmath51 ( which determines the @xmath52 intercepts of these lines ) .",
    "we next differentiate our expressions ( [ eq : d1 ] ) and ( [ eq : d3 ] ) with respect to first @xmath1 and then @xmath51 : @xmath53 we use the first of these equations to eliminate @xmath54 from the second equation .",
    "this operation yields @xmath55 where @xmath56 , etc .",
    "but from the third of equations ( [ eq : set ] ) we have @xmath57 so equation ( [ eq : nearly ] ) can be written @xmath58 between this equation and the last of equations ( [ eq : set ] ) we can sove for the individual derivatives of @xmath25 and @xmath27 : @xmath59 adding these equations , we obtain @xmath60 we use equation ( [ eq : d3 ] ) to eliminate @xmath61 from this equation and rearrange the result : @xmath62 this is a first - order , linear differential equation .",
    "its integrating factor is @xmath63 , so its general solution follows from @xmath64 since a non - zero value of the constant of integration would cause @xmath65 to diverge as @xmath66 , it must be set to zero , and we have finally @xmath67 this equation specifies as a function of the angular momentum @xmath2 the distance in between the points of intersection of the potential s curve and the straight line .",
    "hence it implicitly specifies the curve and thus the potential . to tease out that specification",
    "we first write down the quadratic equation that has roots at @xmath68 : @xmath69 ^ 2=(x_2-x_1)^2\\ ] ] and use equations ( [ eq : xpx ] ) and ( [ eq : d3 ] ) to eliminate @xmath65 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 ^ 2=t(\\lc^2-l^2).\\ ] ] now we eliminate @xmath72 ( eq .  [",
    "eq : d1 ] ) @xmath73 ^ 2=t(\\lc^2-ex_i+f(x_i)).\\ ] ] this equation holds only when @xmath74 , so we set it to that value and rearrange to @xmath75 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & t(f_i+\\lc^2-ex_i).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath76 is the locus of a point on the potential s curve , we now have the explicit equation of that curve .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 etc that form this relation between @xmath68 and @xmath78 are functions of @xmath1 , but the curve specified by the relation does not depend on @xmath1 ; @xmath1 specifies the slope of the straight lines along which individual points @xmath76 lie , not the curve itself .",
    "the standard equation of a parabola is @xmath79 when we make a general linear transformation , @xmath80 this becomes @xmath81 this equation has the same form as our equation ( [ eq : parab1 ] ) for the curve of the potential , so requiring @xmath0 to depend only on @xmath1 implies that the curve of @xmath82 versus @xmath83 is a parabola .",
    "@xmath84 may diverge at the centre , but it will not do so more strongly than @xmath85 , so @xmath86 as @xmath87 , and the origin always lies on the potential s parabola .",
    "moreover @xmath88 so the gradient of the parabola at the origin is the central value of @xmath84 .",
    "also , the gradient of the chord from the origin to an arbitrary point @xmath89 on the parabola is @xmath90 ; in particular , the value of the potential at infinity is given by the parabola s asymptotic gradient .",
    "to avoid the complex expressions in ( [ eq : parab1 ] ) , we reformulate the expression in the form ( [ eq : parab2 ] ) @xmath91 where the constant on the right has to been chosen to ensure that the origin lies on the parabola .",
    "as @xmath92 , @xmath93 will grow too , and the left side of the equation will grow faster than the right side unless @xmath94 tends to @xmath95 . hence @xmath96 and we may rewrite ( [ eq : parab3 ] ) in the form @xmath97 ^ 2=4ax(\\alpha+\\beta \\phi)+y_0 ^ 2\\ ] ] if we choose to set the zero point of @xmath84 at @xmath98 , this quadratic equation for @xmath99 becomes @xmath100 so @xmath101 we cast this into a more familiar form by multiplying top and bottom by the top with the optional sign reversed @xmath102 the plus sign must be chosen to ensure that the central potential is finite . then setting @xmath103 we obtain the isochrone potential in its classic form @xmath104    plots the potential and its radial force out to @xmath105 .",
    "he gives the formula for the mass contained within radius @xmath106 and , taking the derivative of this formula , gives the generating density @xmath107 .",
    "he remarks that the density is everywhere positive and that @xmath108 at large @xmath106 .",
    "he plots the projected density out to @xmath109 together with data from five globular clusters , and the model is seen to fit the data to within the variation between clusters",
    ".    then he asks `` why do clusters resemble the isochrone ? '' .",
    "he remarks that perturbations in the cluster potential due to individual stars will cause the cluster s density profile to evolve until some stable configuration is reached .",
    "normally the endpoint of this evolution is taken to be when the velocity distribution has become maxwellian , but this distribution is only possible in the isothermal sphere , which necessarily has infinite mass .",
    "argues that stars that share the same radial period are resonantly coupled , so they will share energy on a shorter timescale than stars that have different radial periods . in any other model than an isochrone , the set of resonantly coupled stars will contain stars that differ in energy .",
    "consequently these stars will exchange energy .",
    "hypothesises that in these exchanges stars with less energy will gain energy from those with more energy .",
    "he further hypothesises that these energy changes will cause the mass distribution to evolve towards the isochrone model .",
    "once this distribution has been reached , net energy exchanges between resonantly coupled stars will cease , and thus the cluster will cease to evolve .",
    "recognises that a satisfactory exploration of this idea is very hard and proposes a preliminary test of concept .",
    "to develop such a test he considers `` hyperbolic models '' in which the curve @xmath110 is a hyperbola rather than a parabola .",
    "for these models at fixed @xmath1 , @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath2 , with the consequence that at given @xmath1 , circular orbits have shorter periods than eccentric orbits .",
    "conversely , in the set of resonantly coupled stars , circular orbits have more energy than eccentric orbits .",
    "so in a hyperbolic model eccentric orbits will gain energy from from circular orbits .",
    "it follows that the circular orbits will shrink while eccentric orbits grow in size .",
    "but in any cluster the outer regions are dominated by eccentric orbits , so resonant interactions in a hyperbolic model will enhance the density in the outer regions , reducing the central concentration of the model .",
    "a plot of the density profiles of the isochrone and a hyperbolic model shows that the latter is more centrally concentrated than the former .",
    "therefore resonant interactions in the latter will drive the hyperbolic model in the direction of the isochrone .    in the concluding section  remarks that whatever the validity of the hypothesis of resonant interactions , the isochrone constitutes a realistic cluster model for which all quantities are analytically available .",
    "the second paper @xcite computes orbits in the isochrone .  uses @xmath111 as the radial coordinate , explicitly integrating @xmath112",
    "so obtain both @xmath113 and the angular coordinate @xmath114 .",
    "he simplifies these formulae by introducing the potentials @xmath115 and @xmath116 at peri- and apo - centre .",
    "he tabulates @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath0 and the mean density along the orbit for several values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "he plots a few of these orbits .",
    "the third paper @xcite uses eddington s inversion formula to compute the isochrone s distribution function ( ) @xmath119 .",
    "tabulates both @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the number of stars with a given energy .",
    "from the current perspective , the isochrone is one member of a family of useful spherical systems : the other members are the @xcite model and the @xcite model .",
    "these models are all derived from simple functional forms of @xmath121 : @xmath122 and for each one has analytic forms of both the density @xmath107 and the ergodic  @xmath119 .",
    "what uniquely distinguishes the isochrone is the availability of analytic formulae for the actions and angles of its orbits .",
    "this availability is implicit in s second paper but he does not mention this . the relevant formulae appear to have been first given by @xcite .",
    "regular orbits are those whose time series @xmath123 , @xmath124 , etc . , are quasiperiodic : when these time series are fourier transformed , all the frequencies that occur can be expressed as integer linear combinations of three fundamental frequencies .",
    "@xcite shows that a quasiperiodic orbit admits three isolating integrals , which confine the orbit to a three - torus in six - dimensional phase space .",
    "these tori are null in the sense that the poincar invariant @xmath125 of every two surface in the torus vanishes .",
    "the natural labels of the tori are the actions @xmath126 where for @xmath127 @xmath128 and @xmath129 are two closed paths around the torus that can not be distorted into one another while staying within the torus .",
    "these are the only labels of individual tori that can be complemented by canonically conjugate variables @xmath130 , the `` angle '' variables .",
    "the @xmath130 specify positions with a torus .",
    "if a canonical transformation is used to map a null torus , it remains a null torus , and if the image torus can be restricted to a constant - energy surface , it becomes an orbital torus : a surface to which an orbiting particle is confined by motion under the hamiltonian .",
    "the idea behind torus mapping is to arrange for the hamiltonian to be constant on a null torus of pre - determined actions by adjusting the parameters of a canonical transformation such that @xmath131 on the image torus @xcite . if phase space  or a non - negligible part of it  can be foliated with orbital tori in this way , the images of the angle - action coordinates of the analytic tori become angle - action coordinates of the hamiltonian @xmath132 .",
    "any analytic tori can be used for this purpose , but in practice one tries to use tori that are as similar as possible to the orbital tori of @xmath132 . in this regard",
    "the isochrone potential is well suited to mapping tori into orbital tori for many galactic potentials , and it was the choice of @xcite .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator potential ( which is really a limiting case of the isochrone potential ) has also been used for torus mapping @xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath132 is not integrable ( i.e. , many of its orbits are not quasiperiodic ) it will prove impossible to arrange for @xmath132 to be constant on the image torus for some or all action values .",
    "nevertheless , one can foliate phase space with the image tori that result from minimising the variance of @xmath132 over the image torus .",
    "then if we define @xmath133 to be the angle - averaged value of @xmath132 on the image torus with actions @xmath134 , @xmath135 becomes an integrable hamiltonian with explicitly known angle - action coordinates , and the difference @xmath136 becomes a small perturbation of this integrable hamiltonian that yields the original hamiltonian .",
    "thus torus mapping allows us to study motion in a general hamiltonian as perturbation of a very close integrable hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for over a decade after its introduction , torus mapping found little application . in the last several years",
    "it has proved a valuable tool for modelling our galaxy @xcite and i believe it will play a significant role in the scientific exploitation of the billion - euro gaia survey .    $ ] , where @xmath137 is the density of the isochrone sphere , for two values of the colatitude @xmath138 : full curves are for a ray that lies close to the major axis while dotted curves are for a ray that lies close to the minor axis .",
    "the colour of the curves indicates which iterate of the potential was used for the density evaluation .",
    "the  of this model is obtained from that of the isochrone sphere by replacing @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 by @xmath142 .",
    "( from binney 2014 ) ]      since  gave is the isochrone s",
    "@xmath143 and we know how to write @xmath132 as a function of the actions @xmath134 , it is trivial to express the isochrone s @xmath144 as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "since angle - action coordinates are canonical , the jacobian between these coordinates and ordinary @xmath145 coordinates is unity , and the density of stars in angle - action space is @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , the range of each angle coordinate is always @xmath147 , so the phase - space volume occupied by orbits with actions in @xmath148 is @xmath149 and thus the density of stars in three - dimensional action space is @xmath150 .",
    "that is , to within an uninteresting constant factor , the function @xmath146 that completely characterises the dynamics of a stellar population is the density of stars in a readily imagined three - dimensional space .    in an ergodic model such as s isochrone ,",
    "the action - space density of stars is constant on surfaces @xmath151 , which are roughly triangular surfaces @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is a vector whose direction is determined by @xmath132 . in this ergodic model",
    "all three velocity dispersions are equal .",
    "if we shift stars over surfaces of constant @xmath132 , so the action - space density of stars becomes non - uniform on these surfaces , we generate a model that has velocity anisotropy : if we shift the stars towards the @xmath154 axis , we generate radial anisotropy . if we shift the stars away from the @xmath139 axis , we flatten the model .",
    "so long as we leave unchanged the number of stars on each constant-@xmath1 surface , the radial density profile is essentially unchanged : the model may become elongated , or flattened , and it may develop velocity aniotropy , but it retains essentially the same radial density profile .    a significant advantage of considering the  to be a function of the actions rather than a function of energy and other isolating integrals is that it is then very easy to find the gravitational potential of the self - consistent model that has the given .",
    "one simply guesses a potential @xmath155 and on a spatial grid evaluates the density @xmath156 implied by the  in that potential .",
    "one then solves poisson s equation for the corresponding potential @xmath157 at the grid points .",
    "then one takes as a new guess of the self - consistent potential @xmath158 with @xmath159 , and repeats the process , which converges after 35 iterations ",
    "see figure [ fig:0itr ] .",
    "a prerequisite for this program is the ability to evaluate the action integrals given an arbitrary point @xmath145 . a very convenient technique , which is remarkably accurate for modified isochrone models , is the `` stckel fudge '' of @xcite , and this is the technique used by @xcite to explore flattened isochrone models .",
    "there are several ways in which one can change an ergodic  into the of a flattened model and it remains unclear what the best approach is .",
    "@xcite replaced each action @xmath160 in the ergodic  by @xmath161 . if , for example , @xmath162 , the new  decreases with increasing @xmath154 more rapidly than in the ergodic  and the model becomes tangentially biased , and conversely if @xmath163 . if @xmath164 , motion perpendicular to the equatorial plane is being discouraged , and the model becomes flattened .",
    "s isochrone is a fine example of the kind of curiosity - driven research that is so much discouraged by the current funding environment .",
    "there is no way that  could have justified to a grants committee his effort to find the most general potential that made @xmath0 independent of angular momentum .",
    "i suppose he was first just curious , and then became fascinated by the puzzle posed by the search for the isochrone . as section 1 shows , solving this puzzle required quite a tour de force , and was surely not done in some spare afternoon .    once  had found the isochrone , he was impressed by how well it represented globular clusters . and",
    "rightly so , because it is really very surprising that a potential chosen to have orbits with a particular property should even have a non - negative generating density ; that it also have a non - negative  is improbable ; that it should also provide an excellent fit to globular clusters is astounding .",
    "s attempt at a physical explanation of the closeness of globular clusters to the isochrone is highly ingenious and shows deep physical insight . within the last decade resonant relaxation",
    "has become fashionable in studies of galactic nuclei and of planetary systems , but in 1958 s use of the idea was ground - breaking .",
    "that said , i do nt think it was convincing .",
    "yes stars with common values of @xmath0 can more readily exchange energy than stars with unrelated frequencies , but it is far from clear that the sense of that exchange will be to establish equipartition of energy : the essence of the gravithermal catastrophe is that in self - gravitating systems , stars with less energy lose energy to those with more , so in self - gravitating systems wealth inequalities grow as fast as they do just now in the united states .",
    "moreover , why the focus on stars that have equal @xmath0 rather than @xmath165 ?    was recognised that he was only scratching the surface of how a globular cluster might evolve through resonant relaxation .",
    "i think this problem remains an intriguing issue in dynamics , and one that might now be addressed with the help of techniques , torus mapping and taking actions as the arguments of s , that make extensive use of s delightful isochrone .",
    "this work has been supported by stfc by grants r22138/ga001 and st / k00106x/1 and by the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement no ."
