    "the experimental program on high energy heavy ion collisions attempts to study the behavior of qcd matter under extreme conditions .",
    "the original , and still most important goal , is the creation and characterization of the quark - gluon plasma , a thermalized state of deconfined quarks and gluons that could be the form of matter of the whole universe only several @xmath0 after the big - bang .",
    "the study of high-@xmath1 processes as probes of the produced medium starts with the seminal work of j.d .",
    "bjorken in 1982 @xcite .",
    "the idea was that if a medium is produced in a collision , the high-@xmath1 particles produced inside the medium in the initial stage would loss energy ( and eventually thermalize ) when escaping it . the arguments in @xcite were based on elastic scattering , and the loss turned out to be too small . later refinements @xcite propose the medium - induced gluon radiation as the dominant source of energy loss .",
    "twenty years latter , in the heavy ion collider era started with rhic , these effects could be measured for the first time .",
    "the new experimental facts coming from rhic when comparing central auau with pp collisions are the following : the suppression of particles with high-@xmath1 @xcite ( independent of the particle species for @xmath2 gev ) and the total extinction of the signal associated to a high-@xmath1 particle in the backward hemisphere @xcite ( back - to - back correlations ) . together with this , experimental data in dau collisions find an enhancement of high-@xmath1 particle production @xcite ( the so - called cronin effect ) and back - to - back correlations of the same magnitude as the ones measured in pp collisions @xcite .",
    "these effects point to a strong interaction of the high-@xmath1 particle with the ( dense ) produced medium in agreement with the _ jet quenching _ scenario . in the following",
    "we will present the general formalism , based on collinear factorization , in which most of the present calculations are based as well as some comparison with experimental data .    to leading order in perturbative qcd , high-@xmath1 hadroproduction in proton ",
    "proton collisions is described by the factorization formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the proton parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath6 is the partonic cross section and @xmath7 describes the fragmentation of a parton @xmath8 into the hadron @xmath9 carrying a fraction @xmath10 of the momentum .",
    "the description of the experimental data by ( [ eqpqcd ] ) is very reasonable @xcite .    in the case of heavy ion collisions , both the initial and ,",
    "possibly , the final state are different . indeed , the nuclear parton distributions are different from those in free protons and the eventually produced medium would modify the fragmentation .",
    "the knowledge of the pdf for bounded nucleons gives the baseline for the final state effects which would provide the information about the medium .",
    "so , the first goal is to obtain these nuclear pdf from experimental data in different processes .",
    "the review is organized as follows : in next section we give a description of the initial state effects in terms of nuclear modifications of pdf ; section 3 describes the medium - induced gluon radiation spectrum , which is the main part of the present work ; in section 4 some applications are discussed , both for inclusive particle production ( where a comparison with rhic data is possible ) as well as for the more differential case of jet observables . in the last two sections we comment on different approaches and give our conclusions .",

    "namely , fixing the initial parton distributions at a @xmath21 and evolving them to larger @xmath22 values by dglap equations .",
    "the comparison with data would fix the free parameters in the initial condition . in practice , what is usually done is to obtain the initial _ ratios _ , @xmath23 for different partons @xmath24 , and use a known set of proton pdf ( as mrst @xcite , cteq @xcite , etc ... ) to obtain the nuclear pdf . in the ekrs analysis ,",

    "this increase is sometimes compensated by the large shadowing of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , as we have seen this strong gluon shadowing is in disagreement with dis data .",

    "we have seen that both approximations give very similar results when the appropriate kinematical limits and correspondingly similar parameters are taken into account @xcite .",
    "( for an approach based on twist expansion in dis see ref .",
    "the possibility of collisional energy loss has been also explored @xcite with a reasonable result . as it has been exposed in section 3 , formation",
    "time arguments lead to a radiative energy loss which increases as @xmath91 , in the case of a collisional energy loss the growth is , however , as @xmath73 .",
    "so , the centrality dependence of the effect is expected to be sensitive to this different behavior .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that present data can not distinguish between a @xmath73 or @xmath91 behavior @xcite .",
    "notice that in all these analyzes , hadronization is assumed to take place outside the medium .",
    "this could not be the case for the smallest @xmath1 values @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , an initial state origin for the suppression of high-@xmath1 particle production has been proposed in the framework of the saturation approach @xcite , the origin being the smaller number of initial gluons in the nuclei wave functions .",
    "there has been some discussion on whether this removes the cronin enhancement at intermediate values of @xmath1 or not , but finally the different groups agree @xcite in that saturation leads to a suppression for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath141 experimental data ruled out this hypothesis as the main source of high-@xmath1 particle suppression at central rapidities .",
    "however the prediction is @xcite that at higher energies and/or rapidities this mechanism very efficiently suppresses the high-@xmath1 particle yields .",
    "the new preliminary data from brahms @xcite find a strong reduction of @xmath109 s for @xmath142 gev in the forward direction . from the results in section 2",
