    "<S> the lower polarization observed results from electron spin randomization in the thermalization , diffusion , and capture processes .        decreasing the excitation energy such that only the hh bands are excited significantly increases the degree of polarization : from 30  % at the lh bands to more than 80  % at the hh band ( panel ( b ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath25 ( @xmath24 ) photons now only generates spin - up ( -down ) electrons in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced polarization observed implies that some electron spin relaxation processes remain effective . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , this very strong polarized emission provides conclusive evidence that trions bound to te dyads carry a net positive charge . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the emission polarization from a negative trion ( formed from two electrons in a @xmath34 singlet state and a @xmath35 hole ) is solely determined by the hole spin state , and should exhibit a negligible polarization memory due to the very rapid ( @xmath36 @xcite ) spin - orbit - induced hole - spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the emission polarization from a positive trion is determined by the electron spin state , which is much more robust against spin - orbit - induced relaxation mechanisms , and should therefore exhibit a non - negligible polarization memory .    for an excitation energy below the hh band gap , the optical generation of charge carriers is inhibited by the lack of absorption in the znse layer . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible to recover efficient trion emission by optically pumping the donor - bound excitons band ( @xmath8-@xmath9 ) shown in fig . [ zeemansplitting ] ( a ) . at an excitation energy of </S>",
    "<S> , the degree of polarization measured from several dyads is greater than @xmath0 , a figure which is limited by the noise associated to the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this high polarization memory results from three processes efficiently preserving the spin of the electron : resonant excitation of donor - bound spin - polarized excitons , exciton tunneling to te dyads , and trion emission , as discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> resonant excitation of bound excitons suppresses most spin - orbit related relaxation processes occurring at the hh band edge . </S>",
    "<S> bound electrons have been shown to exhibit long relaxation ( @xmath37@xcite ) and dephasing ( @xmath38@xcite ) . for the time during which they are bound to the donor , the exciton spin </S>",
    "<S> is preserved because , in contrast to quantum dots , donor exhibit a high symmetry ( @xmath39 ) effectively protecting them from exchange - induced precession mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the efficient recovery of trion emission indicates that donor - bound excitons rapidly tunnel to nearby te dyads before their radiative recombination lifetime estimated at @xmath40@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phonon - assisted tunneling of charges from donors to ics have been demonstrated in various ic systems@xcite , and is expected to be very efficient in znse due to the relatively strong electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate for the first time that this tunneling efficiently preserves the electron spins . </S>",
    "<S> finally , during the short trion lifetime before radiative recombination , the electron spin does not experience significant relaxation and , as discussed above , the hh - lh mixing has a negligible effect of emission selection rules . following this polarized emission , </S>",
    "<S> the hole is bound to the ic in a spin state given by the polarization of the emission as indicated in fig . [ zeemansplitting ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , to other reported spin initialization schemes , such as coherent population trapping @xcite , ionization of excitons @xcite and optical pumping @xcite , our scheme does not require resonant excitations of trion states , special sample structure , or external magnetic fields , but nonetheless achieves near - unity fidelity .    through the decay time of the trion photoluminescence , we demonstrate that this high - fidelity spin - initialization can be achieved on a picosecond timescale . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ polexcitation ] ( f ) indicates the decay time of trion emission as a function of excitation energy and polarization configuration . </S>",
    "<S> decay times are obtained from mono - exponential fits of the experimental decay curves such as those presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ polexcitation ] ( a)-(d ) . for all excitation energies , </S>",
    "<S> the decay times are one order of magnitude lower than that of excitons@xcite , which is explained by the absence of dark states influencing the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> . nonetheless , these decay times are significantly longer than the spontaneous emission time estimated from the spectral linewidth or rabi oscillations measurements ( not shown , but qualitatively similar to those reported in ref . on @xmath41 ) , which both indicated a spontaneous lifetime of less than ( indicated with the dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ polexcitation ] ( f ) ) . the observed decay time is therefore dominated by processes occurring prior to radiative emission .    at an excitation energy of , </S>",
    "<S> trion decay times are respectively 200 and for co- and cross - polarized configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this significant difference is explained by the coexistence of two factors : 1 ) different initial electron spin populations ( spins are generated in 3:1 ratio ) , and 2 ) the presence of spin - flip mechanisms prior to trion formation on the te dyad . a balance population model taking into account these two factors reveal a capture time ( all processes prior to trion formation ) of and a spin - flip time of . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic is strikingly different for trions bound to n dyads in gaas , where the spin - flip rate dominates the capture time , yielding identical decay times irrespective of the polarization configuration . from 2880 to </S>",
    "<S> , decay time decreases due to lower excess energy and momentum , and spin - flip time increases as indicated by the higher polarization memory shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ polexcitation ] .    below the light - hole band gap , </S>",
    "<S> both decay times abruptly shorten . </S>",
    "<S> although there is less energy and momentum to shed , it also becomes increasingly favorable to form excitons instead of electron - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> approaching the heavy - hole gap , exciton formation dominates and a capture time of is recorded . </S>",
    "<S> this regime of accelerated capture suggests that the most efficient trion formation mechanism is through whole exciton capture . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is probably even faster than the value quoted due to the limited time - resolution of the detection system ( @xmath42 ) , demonstrating that both the capture time and the spontaneous emission lifetime are indeed quite fast . at the heavy - hole gap edge , </S>",
    "<S> decay times for both polarization configurations are similar , since the time associated to spin - flip events is now much longer than the capture time . finally , the decay time of the trion luminescence for resonant excitation of the donor bound exciton ( @xmath8-@xmath43 ) is . </S>",
    "<S> it is principally determined by exciton tunneling time from the neutral donor to the te dyad , which is similar for every dyads measured due to the relatively high donor concentration . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to heavy - hole band edge excitation , exciton capture is slower , but it better protects the electron - spin as demonstrated earlier .    </S>",
    "<S> these initialization times are several orders of magnitude faster than optical pumping schemes with an external magnetic field in faraday configuration @xcite ( @xmath6s - timescale and fidelities of @xmath44 ) , and one order of magnitude faster than optical pumping schemes in voigt configuration @xcite ( ns - timescale and fidelities of @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this speed - up allows for the initialization on timescales much shorter than the expected coherence time of hole - spins in znse . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this initialization time is comparable to those obtained through field induced exciton dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> this last approach however requires an adapted sample structure for electron ionization , a preselection of quantum dots with low fine - structure splitting , and an elaborate strategy to suppress exchange - induced spin precessions prior to ionization . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in summary , we have demonstrated picosecond optical initialization of a hole - spin bound to a te ic in znse with sufficiently high fidelity ( @xmath46 ) and low operation time ( @xmath47 ) for implementing error correction protocols@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the initialization scheme used , based on the rapid spin - preserving tunneling of excitons from donor - bound states to te dyads occupied by a single heavy - hole , arise from the long relaxation time of donor - bound excitons , the very low admixture of light - hole states , and the very short radiative lifetime of ic - bound trions . </S>"
