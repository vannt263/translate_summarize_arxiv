    "one of the most important processes in the propagation of high - energy charged particles in the interstellar medium is their interaction with magnetic fields .",
    "the scattering of cosmic - ray ( cr ) particles on random hydromagnetic waves leads to their effective confinement in the galaxy .",
    "this process of diffusion has a resonant character and it is mainly driven by the energy density associated to the random component of the magnetic field at the resonant wave number of the scattering which is given by the gyro - radius of the particle  @xcite .",
    "the turbulence power spectrum at such scales and the extent of the turbulent region are key quantities in the description of cr propagation .",
    "the aforementioned scatterings change the energy of cr , reshaping their injection energy spectra into the ones we observe at earth .",
    "the ratio of stable secondary to primary cr ( where the reference ratio is often @xmath0 , given that boron is almost entirely secondary ) is a very useful diagnostic for such reshaping and in turn for the spectral index of turbulence power spectrum ( for a recent review on cr , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which is very often assumed to be a power - law @xmath1 of the wavenumber @xmath2 .",
    "unstable secondaries are , on the other hand , a potentially very good tracer of spatial boundaries of the turbulent halo .",
    "indeed , the ratio between stable and decaying isotopes depends on the cr confinement time , which is tightly related to the halo height ( and the diffusion coefficient ) .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to derive these two key quantities ( turbulence spectral index and halo height ) from a different perspective .",
    "we analyse the angular power spectrum of five radio maps .",
    "their main component is given by the galactic diffuse synchrotron emission . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "3 , galactic electrons involved in synchrotron radiation at frequencies @xmath3 ghz are uniformly distributed over the scales of magnetic field inhomogeneities , given their much larger diffusive scale .",
    "therefore the spatial spectrum of synchrotron intensity reflects the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations . by restricting to maps at low radio frequencies ,",
    "we are confident to trace it avoiding contamination from electrons fluctuations , and to be in a regime where synchrotron emission dominates over other diffuse contributions ( e.g. , dust or free - free emissions )  @xcite .    for cr , we consider a picture of fast particles scattering in a medium with weak hydromagnetic turbulence and we will make the simplifying assumption of isotropic turbulence .",
    "the quasi - linear approximation leads to a diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , with @xmath5  @xcite , so its energy dependence is given by the same spectral index of hydromagnetic turbulence , which is derived by computing the angular spectrum of synchrotron emission and assuming a single power - law for the turbulence power - spectrum at all scales .",
    "the angular correlation , however , reflects statistics of turbulence only for sufficiently small angles , above which it follows a universal law @xmath6 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . indeed , when the observation angle @xmath7 for an observer located within an homogeneous turbulence region becomes large , only points along of the lines - of - sight very close to the observer are correlated while farthest points become uncorrelated .",
    "so as the angle increases the angular correlation @xmath8 gets less and less contributions along line of sight , and follows the law @xmath9 which leads to @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the angle of transition between the two regimes is related to the ratio between the outer scale of turbulence @xmath11 and the size of the turbulent region @xmath12 .",
    "provided an estimate for @xmath11 ( assumed to follow from scale of energy injection from supernovae remnant ) , @xmath12 can be derived and represents an estimate for the height of the confinement halo in the galaxy .",
    "although all data considered in this paper come from single - dish surveys , next generation of radio interferometers with wide field of view and a primary beam ( at low frequencies ) overlapping with the ` large ' angular scales considered here , such as lofar  @xcite , askap  @xcite , and ska  @xcite , can provide promising insight into the topic .",
    "previous works on angular power spectrum of radio maps and its link with galactic synchrotron emission include  @xcite .",
    "their main focus has been on estimates of galactic foreground and discussing its possible removal in cmb studies . in this paper , we instead focus the analysis on the extraction of turbulence properties and on their links to cr models .",

    "details are summarized in table 1 and maps are shown in fig.1 in the healpix  @xcite format . in order to avoid spurious projection effects , they have been obtained after regridding original maps into a much finer grid before filling pixels in the healpix tessellation scheme ( with final linear size of pixels close to the original resolution of the survey ) .",

    "the ` real ' power spectrum coefficients can be estimated from measured @xmath16 through @xmath17 , which take into account effects of instrumental noise in @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being , respectively , the rms temperature noise and number of pixels of the map ) and of window function @xmath21 $ ] ( with @xmath22 ) .",

    "in the monochromatic approximation of synchrotron radiation , the energy of an electron emitting at frequency @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 gev ( where @xmath39 is the frequency in ghz and @xmath40 is the magnetic field in @xmath41 ) .",
    "it follows that , assuming a galactic magnetic field of few microgauss  @xcite , emissions at @xmath42  ghz are mostly generated by electrons with energy significantly smaller than 10 gev . the mean distance diffused by such electrons before losing most of their energy can be estimated as @xmath43  @xcite , where @xmath44 is the so - called diffusion coefficient and @xmath45 is the the time - scale for the energy loss associated to radiative processes . in the energy range of interest , typical numbers for the galaxy",
    "are @xmath46 and @xmath47 s  @xcite , which translate into @xmath48 kpc for electrons with energy below 10 gev .",
    "this order of magnitude estimate tells us that the scale of isotropy of the galactic non - thermal electron population involved in the diffuse synchrotron emission detected in the radio maps is very large .",
    "note that this is also because the storage time is far larger than cr electron injection rate which is given by supernovae explosions occurring as , roughly , few per century , which means that relative anisotropy generated by new energy injection is small compared to the total population of electrons ( at low energy ) . for a numerical simulation of spatial distribution of galactic cr electrons see sec .  4.1 in  @xcite , which agrees with above arguments .",
    "cr electron fluctuations are negligible and does not contribute to the angular power spectrum ( except for the very first multipoles @xmath49 ) .",
    "therefore fluctuations in the galactic synchrotron emission can be totally ascribed to fluctuations in the magnetic field . throughout the paper",
    ", we will make the assumption that the latter dominate the angular power spectrum for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "fluctuations might be not all of stochastic nature , but with a contribution from the coherent magnetic field ; on the other hand , in this case , fluctuations are expected to show up only at very large scales .",
    "although synchrotron brightness does not directly trace the total magnetic field but only the component orthogonal to the line of sight , and a change in our viewing angle with respect to the smooth large - scale field ( e.g. , as our line of sight crosses a spiral arm ) can produce a sudden brightness variation , it is unlikely that such fluctuations can contribute to the angular correlation at small scales .",
    "the angular range discussed here can be considered to be descriptive of a truly turbulent regime .",
    "we restrict to maps at @xmath42 ghz , disregarding , e.g. , map of @xcite at 2.3 ghz or wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite maps , where the energy of emitting electrons would be larger and the associated mean diffusion length shorter , so fluctuations in the electron population could be sizable at smaller scales .",
    "this effect can also introduce a frequency dependence in the @xmath13 s , since the energy and , in turn , covered distances of emitting electrons are different at different frequency . on the contrary , for the frequency range considered here",
    ", we can fit all the datasets simultaneously , exactly because anisotropies are given by the same physical framework ( i.e. , magnetic turbulence ) at any wavelength .",
    "we note that this implies that naive extrapolations of results found in the following section to higher frequency ( e.g. , relevant for cmb studies ) should be taken with a grain of salt , since they can be highly non - trivial .",
    "note also that the non - thermal electrons should not be confused with the galactic thermal electron population which instead shows turbulences ( as we will mention in the next section ) , but is not relevant for synchrotron emission ; it can actually introduce anisotropies through free - free absorption of radio waves  @xcite but this effect is important only at @xmath52 mhz . for the diffuse emission under investigation , synchrotron self - absorption is also not relevant .",
    "both theory and numerical simulations support the idea of self - similarity of turbulence  @xcite , which means that the spectrum of turbulence is typically predicted to follow a power - law @xmath53 , where @xmath54 in the 3d kolmogorov case . for this kind of spatial fluctuation spectrum , the angular power spectrum can be simply modeled  @xcite ( for @xmath55 ) .",
    "indeed turbulence scaling as @xmath53 implies @xmath56 in the small angle limit ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 in the large angle limt ( @xmath59 ) , where @xmath60 and the critical angle @xmath61 can be estimated by @xmath62 with @xmath11 being the outer scale of turbulence and @xmath12 the boundary scale of the turbulent region .",
    "although this assumes homogeneous turbulence and @xmath12 is , strictly speaking , the distance from the center to the farthest turbulence in a spherical scenario  @xcite , one can take it as a rough estimate of the height of the turbulent diffusive halo ; this is especially true when considering @xmath13 s from high - latitudes .",
    "moreover , since , once again , inhomogeneity in synchrotron radiation are expected to be associated to magnetic inhomogeneity only , @xmath12 should trace where magnetic turbulence density eventually drops , unless the turbulence has a peculiar inhomogeneity pattern .",
    "we model the angular power spectrum of turbulence as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( namely , the two relevant scalings introduced above and in sec .  1 ) .",
    "such form for @xmath32 has been arbitrarily chosen to include scalings @xmath66 at small @xmath67 and @xmath68 at large @xmath67 .",
    "the exact shape at the transition between the two regimes affects only very mildly our results .    at frequencies below 1 ghz",
    ", synchrotron contribution largely dominates the radio diffuse emission and other components as thermal bremsstrahlung and dust can be neglected  @xcite",
    ". we will however mainly refer to results obtained cutting off the galactic plane such that this assumption can be more confidently trusted .    at high multipoles",
    "the contribution of ( extra - galactic ) sources becomes important and needs to be included . on the other hand , in radio maps",
    ", it is typically found to be subdominant up to @xmath69  @xcite , so marginally relevant for our purposes . at @xmath70 (",
    "namely , in the multipole range where they can be possibly relevant ) , both observations  @xcite and theoretical models  @xcite suggest the contribution of sources to be approximately flat ( the ` poisson noise ' term dominates ) .",
    "we do not attempt to perform the delicate procedure of removing single sources , but rather we model the component , by adding an unknown flat contribution @xmath71 at each frequency ( and marginalizing over it when fitting the @xmath13 s ) .",
    "polarized intensity is potentially an even better tracer of synchrotron anisotropies than total intensity since it is not contaminated by thermal emissions . however , faraday rotation effects around the source and along the line - of - sight ( together with instrumental effects related to beamwidth and bandwidth of observations ) can spoil the original power spectrum in a hardly predictable way .",
    "faraday rotation is extremely important for radio data ( while nearly irrelevant at higher frequencies ) and multi - wavelength observations would be in order to single it out , but unfortunately they are not available . from fig.1 ( bottom panel ) , one can see that @xmath13 s from polarized intensity shows a slightly flatter trend than total intensity .",
    "if this is interpreted as purely due to faraday depolarization effects , an estimate for scaling of the mean differential rotation of polarization angle @xmath72 can be derived  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 for all observed sky and high latitudes , respectively .",
    "such a depolarization scaling ( increasing with the angular scale ) suggests an effect analogous to a beam depolarization ( i.e. , due to averaging of polarization vectors of different orientation ) ; it is however difficult to separate different depolarization effects on @xmath13 s , including that of , for example , fluctuations in the thermal electron population .",
    "due to such uncertainties in extracting the intrinsic angular spectrum , we disregard polarized datasets in the fit of turbulence properties .",
    "theoretical @xmath13 are thus given by @xmath35 which are described by four parameters @xmath76 as mentioned above ; they have been determined by fitting @xmath13 to the expected @xmath77 binned in the same way as @xmath16 in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in two parameters : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which , in our model , do not depend on frequency .",
    "the transition scale @xmath80 between the two regimes @xmath68 and @xmath66 is defined by @xmath81 , and can be easily expressed in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the remaining two absolute normalizations of @xmath32 and @xmath84 can be seen as nuisance parameters ( and can vary with frequency ) .",
    "for each map , we consider multipoles up to @xmath28 ( reported in table 1 ) where @xmath30 is the multipole such that @xmath85 . in this way",
    ", we conservatively avoid to aggressively extract information from multipoles where spurious effects and artifacts ( related to projection , resolution , point sources , etc . )",

    "we can confidently affirm that our results implies @xmath100 .",
    "as discussed above , the multipole of transition @xmath79 is related to the geometry of the turbulence ( namely , corresponds to the angle above which turbulences start to be less and less correlated since lines of sight pass through turbulences of separated turbulent regions ) and its fit provides the size of the turbulent halo in terms of the turbulence scale .",
    "we have @xmath101  kpc ( where 100 pc is a typical scale for @xmath11 as motivated below ) .",
    "the spectral index and halo scale of turbulence are extremely important parameters in the description of propagation of high - energy cosmic - ray particles in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , for isotropic turbulences ( i.e. , same assumption of above analysis ) and in the quasi - linear approximation , the diffusion tensor simplifies to the scalar expression  @xcite : d== , [ eq : d1 ] where @xmath102 is the gyroradius ( with @xmath103=particle rigidity ) , @xmath104 is the turbulence power spectrum ( again assumed to be a power - law ) , @xmath105 is a wavenumber where the random magnetic field assume the value @xmath106 , and the power spectrum is normalized through @xmath107 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath110 is often assumed to be constant up to a vertical scale @xmath111 after which free escape of particles is considered . or ,",
    "similarly , @xmath111 can indicate the scale at which the diffusion coefficient becomes large ( e.g. , @xmath112",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recent derivations of spectral index @xmath113 from cosmic - ray data can be split into two categories .",
    "if data are interpreted assuming a low convection wind ( i.e. , null or linearly increasing in the vertical direction ) , ratios of secondaries to primaries can be typically well - fitted by diffusion ( plus reacceleration ) models with kolmogorov ( @xmath114 )  @xcite or kraichnan ( @xmath115 )  @xcite spectrum of turbulence . on the other hand ,",
    "when convective effects are introduced , flatter turbulence spectra ( @xmath116 ) are favoured  @xcite . more generally , cr models foreseeing processes other than diffusion to be responsible for the flattening of @xmath0 at high - energy ( as e.g. , convection or sources spectrum ) allow large value of @xmath113 .",
    "the analysis in this paper supports this possibility .",
    "note that our result is in agreement with previous works  @xcite , all finding , with different uncertainties , a spectral index @xmath117 for @xmath118 100 .",
    "this interpretation of our result is , however , based on a crucial and not obvious assumption .",
    "the relevant turbulence scale for scatterings of cr particle with hydromagnetic waves is the gyroradius of the particle ( e.g. , for gev cr particles , @xmath119 cm ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the scales of turbulence probed by our analysis .",
    "we have in mind a scenario where supernovae explosions and stellar winds inject turbulent energy at scales @xmath120 ; then such energy is transferred through a direct cascade mechanism ( with no dissipation ) towards smaller scales .",
    "the resulting small - scale turbulence is expected to show the same spectral index of larger turbulence .",
    "however , one can argue that a straightforward extrapolation of the power spectrum down to the very small scales of cr scatterings can be a hazard .    observations of turbulent magnetic field at very small scales ( i.e. , of order of @xmath121 cm ) are lacking . on the contrary ,",
    "fluctuations of thermal electron density in the nearby interstellar medium have been shown to be well approximated by a kolmogorov spectrum  @xcite , for scales ranging from @xmath122 cm to @xmath123 cm .",
    "then it is commonly postulated that magnetic fields are frozen into the ionized interstellar medium and so magnetic turbulence should show the same power - spectrum  @xcite ; however this possibility , although reasonable , needs to be proven .",
    "e.g. , as a counter - example , at scales @xmath124 cm , observational evidences suggest a significantly flatter spectrum for the magnetic component of the turbulence , as we will comment below .",
    "turbulence observations most often rely on faraday rotation measurements ( rm ) . from rm only , on the other hand , it is not possible to separate fluctuations in electron density from magnetic field inhomogeneities ( since rm @xmath125 ) . by combining emission measure ( em @xmath126 ) with rm of polarized background radio sources , ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the magnetic turbulence at angular scales @xmath127 ( corresponding to scales between @xmath128 10 pc and 100 pc and roughly overlapping with the scales @xmath129 considered in this work ) finding a spectral shape significantly flatter than in a kolmogorov case , and , more precisely , @xmath130 , which is compatible at the 2-@xmath31 level with above results ( and , in particular , with @xmath78 is fitted from high - latitudes data , which is the most directly comparable case ) .. for small angles , the spectral index @xmath131 is simply related to the spectral index of @xmath132 by @xmath133  @xcite . ] at smaller scales , em data were not available ; using rm data only the turbulence was found to follow a similar power spectrum up to scales @xmath134 pc , below which a confident distinction between different scenarios is quite hard ( but with kolmogorov spectrum being perfectly viable down to the limit of the survey @xmath128 0.03 pc ) .",
    "although the analysis in  @xcite relies on some assumptions ( e.g. , same spectral index for electron and magnetic fluctuations ) and is limited to a small high - latitude region in the outer galaxy ( while significant variations of rm structure function across the sky have been reported  @xcite ) , the rough agreement with this work is very encouraging . on larger scales , between 0.5 and 15 kpc ( i.e. , above the strictly turbulent domain which is @xmath135 , so possibly probing magnetic fluctuations of different origin ) , ref .",
    "@xcite derived the magnetic spectrum from the ratio of rm and dispersion measure ( dm @xmath136 ) of pulsars in the galactic disk , finding a nearly flat spectrum with @xmath137 .    from a theoretical point of view , it is not completely clear if a kolmogorov - like spectrum should be expected .",
    "many numerical simulations of 3d magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence have reported a shallower power spectrum , and the issue is currently under debate ( for recent reviews see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    to summarize this part",
    ", the state of the art about magnetic field turbulence is that from the observational data we have ( including this work ) , which sample turbulence only at scales above few pc , the power spectrum is found to be much flatter than in the kolmogorov case . at smaller scales , there are hints for a kolmogorov power spectrum , but data which could lead to conclusive proofs or to conclusive exclusions of other models are lacking .",
    "so we can take two perspectives .",
    "we can assume results found in this work to hold all the way down to very small scales , and the above discussion on consequences for cr models follows .",
    "conversely , we can assume a kolmogorov power spectrum at small scales , and take the results as an evidence for a transition between two regimes , namely , a departure from self - similarity for the observed spectrum .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that the kolmogorov turbulence is in form of thin sheets which for large angular scales effectively appears as 2d turbulence . in this scenario , going from small to large scales , a transition from a 3d to a 2d turbulence regime would occur , where a 2d kolmogorov power spectrum @xmath138 is not far from our best - fit values .",
    "note that this uncertainty ( namely , a degeneracy between spectral and spatial properties of turbulence ) is a general caveat in these analyses and is given by the fact that we are able to observe only 2d projections of underlying 3d spectra .",
    "for what concerns the halo height @xmath111 , it is not easily constrained by cr data since they typically depends on the ratio @xmath139 , rather than on @xmath111 only .",
    "the strongest bounds come from ` radioactive clocks ' , namely , unstable secondaries , as mentioned in the introduction , with the most precise measurements being , at present , @xmath140be/@xmath141be . neglecting local effects",
    ", they suggest a diffusive zone significantly thicker than the galactic disc , i.e. , @xmath142 kpc  @xcite ; this is also supported by observations of significantly extended magnetic structures in external galaxies ( for a recent analysis of a spiral disk galaxy , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "another important observable for deriving magnetic halo properties is the galactic total synchrotron intensity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this case , the disentanglement of spatial properties of magnetic fields from cosmic - rays distribution properties , and of different magnetic components ( regular and turbulent ) themselves is very challenging .",
    "although @xmath12 can not be immediately identified with @xmath111 , it represents a rough estimate , in particular if extracted from observations at high - latitudes , see above .",
    "such estimate crucially depends on assumptions about outer scale of turbulence .",
    "the dominant source of turbulence is believed to be supernova remnants ( and superbubbles ) , injecting energy in the surrounding interstellar medium on scales @xmath143 pc ( for a review , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we infer a significantly thinner halo @xmath144 kpc , in apparent conflict with cr data .    the disagreement could be alleviated if most snrs are clustered with supershells of much larger extent than 100 pc ( basically , @xmath145 kpc would require @xmath146 kpc ) .",
    "however , although many hi supershell have been observed in the galaxy  @xcite ( and in external galaxies as well ) extending up to kpc - scales ( and presumably crated by sn explosions ) , it is unlikely that the mean characteristic outer scale of turbulence ( i.e. , the scale at which snr energy is transferred to interstellar medium ) is significantly larger than 100 pc , which follows from both simulation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and observational ( e.g. , discussion in @xcite ) arguments .",
    "on the other hand , the local environment can significantly affect abundances of radioactive species , since they travel short distances before decaying ( of order of 100 pc ) .",
    "in particular , an underdensity of a similar size surrounding the sun can exponentially increase the amount of decays ( lowering the local ratio )  @xcite .",
    "therefore the model of the local interstellar medium is crucial for the determination of @xmath111 from unstable secondaries .",
    "current observations  @xcite do not allow a very detailed description of the local bubble to precisely estimate this effect  @xcite . however , assuming a simple and reasonable underdensity of @xmath147 pc , bounds on @xmath111 can be strongly relaxed and @xmath144 kpc becomes fully viable  @xcite . moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the diffusive zone in models with large @xmath113 is constrained to be rather small .",
    "a consistent ( but not conventional ) picture seems to emerge and deserves further investigation .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the angular power spectrum in five radio maps at multipoles @xmath148 . at these scales ,",
    "the @xmath13 s are a tracer of fluctuations in the galactic synchrotron emission , since contributions from sources or other diffuse components are subdominant . at frequency below few ghz , large - scale anisotropies in synchrotron radiation",
    "are mainly induced by magnetic turbulence , while the non - thermal electron population involved in the emission has a rather smooth spatial distribution .",
    "we assumed a simple isotropic and power - law spectrum of turbulence @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical angular power spectrum thus scales as @xmath58 before @xmath149kpc and @xmath56 afterwards , where @xmath12 can be considered in first approximation as an estimate for the boundary of the turbulent diffusive halo .",
    "results of fits are mildly dependent on latitudes .",
    "the spectral index is found to be @xmath150 , much flatter than kolmogorov ( @xmath54 ) or kraichnan ( @xmath151 ) cases often considered in the literature .",
    "moreover , data favour a very thin halo , @xmath144 kpc .    if extrapolated to smaller scales , such galactic turbulence scenario is consistent with cosmic - ray data , but pointing towards non - conventional models where convective winds play a significant role . on the contrary , assuming kolmogorov turbulence to hold at scales comparable to the gyroradius of galactic cr particles , our results can imply a non - trivial mechanism for transferring turbulent energy from large to small scales .",
