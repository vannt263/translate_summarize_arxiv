    "an understanding of how external and internal dynamical effects combine to produce the observed kinematic properties of dwarf galaxies is fundamental to probing the nature of these systems . since dwarfs may represent the smallest dark - matter ( dm ) halos that have survived to the present epoch  or simply the smallest that have retained baryons ( ferrara and tolstoy 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ; grebel and gallagher 2004 ; susa and umemura 2004 )  they represent an important link to broader structure formation models .",
    "as we learn more about the dynamical state of the galactic halo , however , is has become clear that complex interactions of the components within the halo  including local dwarfs  may be common ( taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ; coleman et al . 2004 ) . detailed @xmath8-body models hint at the frequency of interactions ( moore et al .",

    "fully , we need to know the nature of the dm subhalos .",
    "nearby dwarfs and their dm halos represent the best local proxies for the original dm seeds that built up the milky way ( read et al .",
    "2006a ) . but",
    "to probe the satellites and study their dm halos in detail , we need to account for the effects of interactions , since these can strongly alter our conclusions regarding the properties of the halos ( klessen and kroupa 1998 ; fleck and kuhn 2003 ; metz et al . 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , understanding the tidal history of dwarfs depends on the knowledge of the total mass and structure of the dm halo of the milky way in which these interactions occur .",
    "the problem is deliciously interconnected and devilishly hard to solve , particularly in the absence of a secure description of the small halos comprising the milky way s extended halo .",
    "we have embarked on an effort to address part of this riddle by systematically studying the kinematic properties of many of satellites of the milky way ( walker et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "the present paper focuses on the leo  i dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy .",
    "two general cases arise when we consider the dynamical state of a galaxy such as leo  i. first , a galaxy can be considered to be in dynamical equilibrium if it is sufficiently isolated from outside perturbations .",
    "this case is well - understood theoretically though it does admit to various degeneracies ( e.g. anisotropy and the mass distribution ) and other complications ( deprojections of possibly non - spherical mass or tracer distributions ) .",
    "nonetheless , one can , with enough data , close in on the mass distribution from the kinematics and distribution of baryonic tracers .",
    "however , given the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation noted above , the second , more realistic expectation is that galaxies , particularly dwarf satellites , can never be in true dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the question then becomes one of degree : how far out of equilibrium is a given galaxy and how do deviations from equilibrium affect our interpretation of its kinematics ?",
    "the motions of stars in a satellite galaxy are governed by its underlying mass distribution and the external potential in which the galaxy orbits . to complicate matters ,",
    "the external potential may be asymmetric , or significantly time - dependent , particularly for orbits with periods that span a significant fraction of the age over which the parent galaxy formed .",
    "but even if the external potential is highly symmetric , a dwarf galaxy in a non - circular orbit will necessarily experience a time - variable potential as it traces its orbital path ( pinchardo et al .",
    "clearly , many factors dictate the tidal history of any given galaxy , and , by implication , the degree to which a given system s kinematics are affected by tidal influences .    we know that in extreme cases these processes can have a transformative effect , converting dwarf galaxies into streams that encircle their parent galaxies ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 , 2001 ; majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) . whether less severe effects have been seen in other systems",
    "remains a matter of debate ( e.g. , ursa minor : martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 , palma et al .",
    "2003 , muoz et al . 2005 ; carina : kuhn et al .",
    "1996 , monelli et al . 2004",
    "; majewski et al . 2005 ) . as a population , local dwarfs exhibit trends , such as decreasing mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ( @xmath9 ) for milky way and m31 satellites ( mateo et al .",
    "1998a ; hereafter m98 ) and correlations of stellar ages in dwarf systems as a function of @xmath9 ( van den bergh 1994 ; mayer et al .",
    "2007 ) , that provide circumstantial evidence tides do influence satellite properties to varying degrees .",
    "since our goal is to characterize the dm halos dwarf galaxies , it is clearly advantageous to try to identify galaxies that best exemplify systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "it is for this reason we ( and others : m98 ; sohn et al . 2007 ; koch et al .",
    "2007 ) have chosen to focus on the leo  i dsph galaxy . located 255 kpc from the milky way ( caputo et al . 1999 ; held et al . 2001 ; bellazzini et al . 2004 )",
    ", leo  i seems to be a good candidate as a truly isolated dwarf that is close enough for detailed kinematic study .",
    "this reasoning motivated m98 to obtain radial velocities for 33 red giants in leo  i from which they derived a central velocity dispersion . under the assumptions of dynamical equilibrium and mass",
    "follows light , they argued that leo  i does contain a dm halo of comparable mass to those inferred in other , closer dsph galaxies .",
    "this result implied that tides are not the sole cause of the observed kinematic properties of dsph galaxies .",
    "however , leo  i has two puzzling properties that suggest it may not be the ideal , dynamically - isolated system we would hope it to be .",
    "first , the heliocentric radial velocity , @xmath10 of leo  i is extreme ( 282.9 km / s ; see section 4.3.1 ) .",
    "relative to the galactic center rest frame , it has a recessional velocity of 174.9 km / s as observed from the sun , very high for a remote satellite of the milky way .",
    "indeed , leo  i can singlehandedly inflate the inferred mass of our galaxy by nearly a factor of five compared to dynamical analyses of kinematic samples that exclude it ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ; fich and tremaine 1991 ; kochanek 1996 ; wilkinson and evans 1999 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "but the large velocity also has an important implication for leo  i itself .",
    "standard cold dm ( cdm ) hierarchical formation models of the milky way tend to produce outward - streaming dwarfs at late times as the smaller galaxies begin to interact strongly with the dominant , massive central halo ( taylor et al .",
    "2005 ) or other dark halos ( taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ; sales et al .",
    "2007a , b ) . is the high systemic velocity of leo  i direct evidence of a strong past interaction with the milky way or , possibly , some third body ?",
    "the second enigma is that leo  i has a complex star - formation ( sf ) history ( gallart et al .",
    "1999b ; hernandez et al .",
    "2000 ; dolphin 2002 ) , with the latest significant episode ending about 1 gyr ago . within the framework of the tidal - stirring models of mayer et al .",
    "( 2001a , b , 2005 ) , periods of enhanced star formation represent times when the gas in a dwarf is compressed toward the center of its dm halo during strong interactions with the parent halo .",
    "does the complex star formation history of leo  i reveal evidence of such an event  presumably an interaction with the milky way  about 1 gyr ago ?    this paper presents new high - precision kinematic observations of over 300 individual member red giants in the leo  i dsph galaxy , significantly extending both the quantity , quality , and spatial coverage of earlier samples . with these new data it is possible to address whether leo  i represents an example of an isolated , equilibrium system , or if its dynamics are significantly influenced by external tidal effects",
    "the principal data of this paper consist of new radial velocity measurements derived from spectra obtained using the multi - fiber hectochelle spectrograph on the mmt telescope ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "1998 ; szentgyorgyi 2006 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out during two nights dedicated to this project ( march 31/april 1 and april 2/3 , 2005 ) , and during parts of six separate nights of two hectochelle ` queue runs ' in april , 2006 and march / april 2007 ( see table 1 for details ) .",
    "seven different fiber configurations were used , denoted chronologically as ` c1 ' through ` c7 ' .",
    "we purposely allowed for considerable target overlap in the various configurations to allow us to use repeat measurements to quantify the velocity uncertainties ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the targets is shown in figure  [ figs : xieta ] , along with all of the leo  i red giant ( rg ) candidates .",
    "candidates stars to be observed with hectochelle were selected from the ( @xmath11 , @xmath12@xmath11 ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of leo  i derived from ccd data obtained with the hiltner 2.4 m telescope at mdm observatory in february , 2004 , and for the outermost candidates , from data we obtained with the 90prime camera on the steward 2.3 m telescope at kitt peak in feb 2006 ( williams et al .",
    "the locations of the all candidate stars in the cmd are shown in figure  [ figs : cmd ] .",
    "the photometric calibration was carried out using 22 stars in the field that have calibrated photometry from m98 .",
    "the rms scatter of the adopted transformations is about 0.02 mag in both @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the astrometry for these stars was determined by transforming of the ccd coordinates to standard coordinates , @xmath14 using 200 - 400 usnob / nomad ( monet et al . 2003 ) coordinates of stars in the field .",
    "we chose regions devoid of detectable stars in our deep imaging to be used for spectroscopic sky measurements .",
    "these sky fiber locations span the full radial extent of the target fibers relative to the center of leo  i. additional sky fibers were also randomly assigned by the hectochelle fiber robot software at the time of observation to utilize otherwise idle fibers . since these could , by chance , land on an astronomical source , no automatically - assigned sky fibers were used in our analysis .",
    "we also observed the radial velocity standard hd171232 , as standards in the sa57 field ( stefanik et al .",
    "the hectochelle fiber robot software generally assigned different fibers to these stars on separate visits .",
    "further details of our leo  i and standard - star observations are provided in table  1 .",
    "hectochelle employs two @xmath15 ccds , illuminated by 244 fibers and read out through 4 amplifiers ( 2 on each ccd ) .",
    "fibers are assigned to targets to avoid mechanical overlaps and collisions , while maximizing user - specified priorities , and can be positioned anywhere within a 1-degree diameter field .",
    "the fibers terminate at the focal plane of the collimator of an echelle spectrograph located on an optical bench near the telescope . to increase the packing factor on the ccd , the fibers are mounted in a zigzag pattern at the slit plane .",
    "thus , consecutive spectra are offset in both the spatial and dispersion directions from one another .",
    "the entire pattern also exhibits slight curvature along the ` spatial ' axis due to anamorphic effects in the spectrograph optics . to avoid order overlap , an interference filter was used to isolate the wavelength region of interest .",
    "we observed our targets through the ` rv52 ' filter which covers the region of the mg  i / mgb features around 5200 .",
    "further technical information on hectochelle is available at ( szentgyorgyi 2006 ) and from the user s manual .",
    "iraf routines were used to process the raw images , extract and wavelength - calibrate the individual spectra , and to measure the final heliocentric velocities .",
    "the procedures are broadly similar to ones we have employed in the past for single - object slit spectroscopy ( e.g. vogt et al .",
    "1998 ) and for multi - fiber spectroscopy of southern dwarf galaxies ( walker et al .",
    "we briefly summarize them here .",
    "all data were processed by first subtracting the overscan , trimming the images , then combining the data from the two amplifiers for both ccds .",
    "individual exposures were combined to form single deep images and to remove the brightest point - like cosmic rays in the raw data using a conservative sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "hectochelle had a source of significant scattered light within the spectrograph chamber during the 2005 run ( configurations c1 and c2 in table 1 ) .",
    "this problem made it impossible to flatfield these data or to perform background subtraction .",
    "we estimate the scattered light cost us about one magnitude in depth compared to the 2006/2007 observations , all of which were unaffected by this problem .",
    "for the 2006 and 2007 observations ( configurations c3 through c7 in table 1 ) , we determined relative fiber throughputs from observations of the twilight sky .",
    "quartz lamp spectra were inadequate for this as the light sources on the telescope do not illuminate the fibers uniformly .",
    "after extraction , wavelength calibration ( see below ) and dividing by the relative throughputs , we then combined all the sky fiber spectra to make a master sky for each configuration .",
    "this combined sky spectrum was subtracted this from the spectrum of each target and each individual sky spectrum .",
    "the master sky spectrum was typically produced by averaging 40 - 60 individual spectra , so it adds little variance to the final sky - subtracted spectra .",
    "overall , this procedure appears to have worked well : individual sky fibers had little mean residual flux after subtraction ( typically @xmath16%  of the original sky flux ) .",
    "in contrast to the 2005 data , cross - correlations of both target and sky fibers rarely produced a signal at the expected velocity of scattered sunlight at the time of observations ( see figure  [ figs : ccf1 ] ) .",
    "we established the locations of the individual spectra on the detectors by tracing and extracting spectra of quartz lamps obtained just before or after each set of observations for a given configuration .",
    "the spectral traces from the quartz images were then shifted spatially _ en masse _ to best match the fainter spectra of the corresponding target exposures .",
    "the shifts of the quartz spectra to the target spectra were stable to about 0.01 pixel , as determined by comparing results for individual target exposures of a given configuration .",
    "thar calibration emission spectra were extracted using the same traces used for the corresponding target spectra . a dispersion solution for each arc spectrum was determined by fitting the centroids of 35 - 40 lines with known wavelengths to a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "the fits had a typical rms scatter of about 0.3 - 0.5 km / s .",
    "the resulting dispersion solutions were then applied to all spectra , producing wavelength - calibrated , one - dimensional spectra for every fiber .",
    "the spectra are defined from 5150  to 5300 , with an effective dispersion of 0.01  / pix ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "spectra of the standard stars were processed in essentially the same way except that these were sufficiently bright to be traced without need of a quartz exposure .",
    "we constructed a high signal - to - noise master template spectrum from individual spectra of radial velocity standard stars observed during the 2005 mmt run ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we chose hd171232 to act as a ` master ' template , then used the fourier cross - correlation routine * fxcor * in the _ rv _ package of iraf to measure relative shifts of this template and all the standard - star spectra .",
    "our results for each standard - star observation spectrum are listed in table 2 , based on an assumed heliocentric velocity of hd171232 of @xmath18 km / s ( udry et al .",
    "we also list the heliocentric velocities for the standard stars from sa57 ( stefanik et al .",
    "the individual standard - star spectra were doppler - shifted by their observed velocity shift relative to hd171232 , then summed to make a master template with a mean signal - to - noise ratio of about 400:1 per resolution element . at this stage ,",
    "the final template was tied to the velocity scale defined by hd171232 given the udry et al .",
    "( 1999 ) velocity .",
    "a problem became evident when we found that the sa57 standards ( stefanik et al .",
    "2006 ) from all runs exhibit an offset of @xmath19 km / s when tied to hd171232 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we suspect this offset is not associated with the sa57 standards for the following reasons .",
    "first , the mean heliocentric velocity of sky fiber spectra with a tonry - davis ( 1979 ) index , @xmath20 , greater than 2.8 ( see section 3.2 ) was @xmath21 km / s , consistent with @xmath22 , though not with zero .",
    "second , during the 2006 run , three sets of twilight exposures were obtained .",
    "these data gave a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath23 km / s for the twilight spectra using the hd171232 velocity zeropoint ; again consistent with @xmath22 but not with zero .",
    "third , velocity measurements from other configurations where the spectra of faint stars are overwhelmed by moonlight were found to be offset by @xmath24 km / s using the hd171232 zeropoint .",
    "finally , udry et al . ( 1999 ) remark that the velocity of hd171232 appears to drift , a result we appear to confirm .",
    "we can reconcile hd171232 , the sa57 standards and the night - sky and twilight spectra by simply shifting our adopted velocity scale by @xmath25 km / s .",
    "we did this by amending the heliocentric velocity in the master template spectrum by @xmath26 km / s , effectively adopting @xmath27 km / s for hd171232 . with this change ,",
    "the heliocentric twilight and night - sky velocities all averaged to within @xmath28 km / s of zero , and the velocities of the sa57 standards came into excellent agreement to their published values ( stefanik et al . 2006 ; table 2 ) .",
    "we believe that our final heliocentric velocity zeropoint is systematically accurate to @xmath1 km / s .",
    "we used * fxcor * in iraf to measure the velocities of leo  i candidates relative to the template .",
    "typical cross - correlation functions are shown in figure  [ figs : ccf1 ] .",
    "tonry and davis ( 1979 ) defined a parameter , @xmath20 , which measures the height of the cross - correlation peak relative to the amplitude of the noise in the cross correlation function near the peak .",
    "the * fxcor * task reports @xmath20 for all spectra for which it estimates a velocity .",
    "all of the spectra used here have @xmath29 .",
    "this cutoff represents the value of @xmath20 where it became difficult to identify consistently a correlation peak , and where quantitative comparisons of independent measurements of individual stars revealed that our velocity measurements were becoming unreliable ( see below ) .",
    "some statistics for our mmt / hectochelle fiber observations are provided in table 3 .",
    "of the 749 fibers assigned to astronomical ( i.e. , non - sky ) targets in the five leo  i configurations , we obtained 543 spectra ( 72% ) of 371 different targets that produced cross - correlations with @xmath29 .",
    "about 59%  of our assigned fibers ( 440 spectra ) produced good velocities for the final sample of 312 likely leo  i members observed with hectochelle ( membership is quite clear - cut in the case of leo  i as described below ) .",
    "if we add the 33 targets from m98 ( we justify this below ) , our final sample consists of 387 stars , 328 of which are likely leo  i members ( 17 of the m98 stars were reobserved with hectochelle ) .",
    "a total of 108 stars ( 297 spectra ) were observed multiply , with 51 stars twice , 38 three times , 15 four times , and 3 five times . one star ( number 359 in table 5 ) was observed on six separate occasions .",
    "table 4 gives a complete listing of all the repeat measurements within the combined mmt / keck dataset .",
    "we have used the repeat observations to assess the quality of our velocity measurements . figure  [ figs : mmtdiffs ] plots the histogram of the velocity differences in our dataset , along with plots of the velocity differences as a function of position , velocity , and brightness .",
    "there are no significant correlations apparent , nor do we see evidence that different configurations are offset relative to one another .",
    "repeat measurements can also be used to estimate the individual velocity errors as described by walker et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "we assume a relation between the velocity error , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for star @xmath32 , of the form @xmath33 the best - fit parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined via a least - squares minimization process ( walker et al .",

    ", we did not vet the sample in any way .",
    "astrophysical sources of velocity variations ( e.g. atmospheric or binary motions ) will contribute to our estimates of the individual velocity errors .",
    "our data do indeed reveal evidence of possible binaries ( section 3.4 ) , but neither the magnitude of the velocity variations nor the frequency of detectable binaries significantly alter our results ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath40 from repeat measurements , is quite flat , probably owing to systematic run - to - run velocity errors at the 1 - 2 km / s level .",
    "these represent a negligible contribution to our final error budget since , even with a catalog of 300 + leo  i members , our kinematic results are still dominated by sampling uncertainties ( sections 3.3 , 4.2 ) .    for the stars with multiple observations , we used these error estimates to determine the mean velocity for each star .",

    "the estimate of @xmath42 is given by the weighted mean : @xmath43 .",

    "the standard deviation of @xmath60 about the fitted line is 3.5 km / s while the standard deviation of the data in the histogram is 4.8 km / s .",
    "we find no significant correlation of velocity difference between our data and that of s07 as a function of position or @xmath11-band brightness .",
    "since the comparisons of our mmt and keck datasets reveal no systematic trends , we tentatively conclude that the source of the systematic trend lies in s07 measurements .",
    "many authors have noted special complications with velocity measurements using near - ir spectra due to telluric contamination ( a summary of this is given in walker et al .",

    "figure  [ figs : rpa ] is a plot of all velocities measured from our sample for spectra with @xmath29 , as a function of radial distance from the adopted center of leo  i ( mateo 1998 ; see figure  [ figs : xieta ] ) .",

    "the stars in this velocity range also exhibit a clear concentration toward the center of leo  i. when we also consider the expected velocity distribution of field stars in this direction ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is clear that all stars with @xmath65 in the range 250 - 320 km / s are highly probable leo  i members ( the range 200 - 400 km / s would have identified precisely the same sample of likely members ) . stars with velocities outside this range are uniformly distributed spatially in the field , consistent with non - membership ( see figure  [ figs : xieta ] ) .",
    "sky fibers with @xmath29 tend to exhibit a mean velocity of about @xmath66 km / s when plotted in figure  [ figs : rpa ] because fxcor assumes the target is an astronomical object and applies a heliocentric correction . for our leo  i observations ,",

    "four regions in the cmd were identified that correspond to red giant branch stars ( rgb ; region 1 ) , asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ; region 2 ) , field stars ( region 3 ) , and blue - loop stars ( region 4 ) . regions 1 and 2 correspond , roughly , to our kinematic selection region ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "table  7 lists the numbers of stars in each region from direct counts in the cmd , along with kinematic results for stars in each cmd region where available .",
    "consider first the rgb and agb regions ( regions 1 and 2 , respectively ; the data used here are listed in table 7 ) .",
    "the ratio of rgb candidates in the inner and outer samples is @xmath163 , and @xmath164 for the agb candidates .",
    "if we only consider the kinematic sample and assign membership to stars based on their velocities , the rgb kinematic members in the inner and outer samples becomes @xmath165 , while for the agb stars the ratio is @xmath166 .",
    "that is , the intermediate - age population traced by the agb stars ( gallart et al .",
    "1999a ; hernandez et al .",
    "2000 ; dolphin 2002 ) is almost exclusively located within with the break radius , @xmath167 arcsec .",
    "rgb stars , which arise from both the intermediate and older populations , extend over both the inner and outer regions .",
    "this analysis underscores the value of the kinematic data to search for population gradients .",
    "field stars , almost all certain non - members of leo  i based on their location in the cmd ( region 3 of figure  [ figs : cmd2 ] ) exhibit a ratio of @xmath168 , consistent with the ratio of the areas of the inner and outer regions ( @xmath169 ) . this contamination explains the relatively small ratio of inner / outer agb stars in the non - kinematic sample .",
    "blue - loop stars ( region 4 in figure  [ figs : cmd2 ] ) exhibit an inner / outer ratio of about 6.0 , and , like the agb , are intermediate - age stars ( dohm - palmer and skillman 2002 ) .",
    "the actual ratio of inner / outer blue - loop stars is likely considerably larger since non - members preferentially contaminate the outer sample .",
    "these points are presented graphically in figure  [ figs : rcumulative ] where we plot cumulative radial distributions of various subsets of stars from the leo  i cmd ( figure  [ figs : cmd2 ] ) .",
    "the left panel shows that , among radial - velocity members , stars selected in the agb region of figure  [ figs : cmd2 ] ( region 2 ) are more centrally distributed than the rgb stars ( region 1 ) .",
    "this holds even if we only consider kinematically - selected rgb stars ( which are biased in radius due to fiber restrictions and science aims ) , or the full sample of rgb candidates ( thick and thin solid lines in figure  [ figs : rcumulative ] , respectively ) noting that the counts of photometrically - selected rgb candidates are essentially complete at all radii .",
    "virtually all ( 44 of 45 ) of the agb members are inside @xmath162 despite the fact that we observed 10 stars from this region in the cmd outside the break radius .",
    "a ks test comparing the observed radial distributions of the agb and rgb kinematic members reveals a low probability of @xmath170% that the two are drawn from a common parent distribution .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figs : rcumulative ] addresses the possible segregation of agb and blue - loop stars from the older stars in leo  i and each other .",
    "the cumulative distribution of photometrically - selected agb stars exhibits a change in slope near @xmath162 .",
    "we know from the kinematic sample of agb stars that this is where field contamination begins to dominate those counts .",
    "the blue - loop stars show a similar slope change , but at about @xmath171 .",
    "if this break in slope is due to contamination by blue disk and halo stars , and background quasars and galaxies , the radial profile suggests that the blue - loop stars may be even more centrally concentrated than the agb in leo  i. a ks test suggests that there is a 0.1%  probability the radial profiles of the agb and blue - loop photometric candidates are drawn from the same parent distribution , suggesting some difference in the distributions of these two populations .",
    "we conclude that the leo  i stellar populations segregate by age such that the younger populations ( agb and blue - loop stars ) are preferentially near the galaxy center relative to the older ( rgb ) population .",
    "moreover , this segregation appears to occur at the break radius , @xmath167 arcsec , where we see kinematic segregation ( figure  [ figs : deltav ] ) and ( possibly ) structural changes in leo  i ( figure  [ figs : leoishape ] ) .",
    "we present here a descriptive model that aims to account for all the features we have identified in our study of leo  i , as well as many long - standing enigmas of this galaxy .",
    "we assume leo  i is bound to the milky way and is currently on a highly elliptical orbit ; figure  [ figs : leoiorbit ] shows a representative example .",
    "the period for the orbit in figure  [ figs : leoiorbit ] is about 5.5 gyr ; one orbit ( defined here as one complete cycle in @xmath75 ) is shown in figure  [ figs : leoirorbit ] .",
    "the other orbits that we consider in this discussion have similar periods .",
    "it is important to appreciate that these orbital periods are sufficiently long that it may not be valid to assume a static milky way potential or that leo  i has remained isolated from other objects in the halo .",
    "we begin our discussion considering only the effects of the last perigalactic passage of leo  i , about 1 gyr ago for all cases considered here .",
    "one aspect of an elliptical orbit that is well known ( see king 1962 ; allen and richstone 1988 ; read et al . 2006b ; choi et al .",
    "2007 ) is that the instantaneous tidal radius of a dwarf galaxy in such an orbit varies with galactocentric distance .",
    "when closest to the galactic center , for example , leo  i s true tidal radius ( in the roche sense ) will be smallest , while far from the galactic center , the tidal radius will be large . for any assumed orbit , we can calculate the tidal radius crudely in a two - body approximation as @xmath172 ( we assume @xmath173 ; king 1962 ) .",
    "we can then ask , at what perigalactic distance does the minimum tidal radius , @xmath174 , equal the kinematic break radius , @xmath162 , that we identified in section 4.3.3 ?",
    "figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] is a plot of @xmath174 as a function of perigalacticon for orbits of leo  i in a logarithmic milky way potential with total mass ( to the virial radius ) of @xmath175 for a range of assumed leo  i mass , and for various assumed present - day galactocentric tangential velocities for leo  i. further details of these orbits are listed in table  8 .",
    "our assumption that leo  i is bound to the milky way implies that the galaxy s present tangential velocity is less than about 100 km / s , so only results from models with @xmath140 km / s ( table 8) are plotted in figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] corresponds to @xmath176 pc , equal to the physical size of the observed break radius ( @xmath167 arcsec ) at the current distance of leo  i.    for @xmath177 , we find that leo  i had to pass within about 4 kpc from the galactic center for @xmath178 .",
    "lower masses imply larger perigalactica , up to @xmath179 kpc for @xmath180 .",
    "the latter mass , the lowest considered in figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] , corresponds to a global mass - to - light ratio of @xmath181 for leo  i and is reasonable for a purely baryonic case . for a lower limit of @xmath182 ( appropriate for the comparatively young central populations of leo  i ; see m98s ) , we estimate that perigalacticon may have been as large as about 35 kpc .",
    "one implication of this scenario is that many stars initially bound to leo  i prior to perigalactic passage , would have found themselves outside the galaxy s tidal radius as it passed by the milky way .",
    "stars with radially - outbound orbits relative to the center of the dwarf would have begun to drift away at a relative speed comparable to the internal velocity dispersion , and in the process initiating the formation of tidal arms ( piatek and pryor 1995 ; oh et al .",
    "1995 ; s07 ) . over the time interval , @xmath183 , since perigalacticon , stars will drift a distance of order @xmath184 from the center of leo  i , or about 10 - 30 kpc for @xmath185 km / s for the orbits listed in table  8 . as leo  i continues to orbit away from the milky way",
    ", its tidal radius grows so that , at present , it is about 20 kpc",
    ". consequently , some of the stars that were formally unbound at perigalacticon will be recaptured , but because the stars on rapid , radial orbits remain unbound , the velocity distribution will become progressively more tangentially anisotropic in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "the key point is that for a satellite in an elliptical orbit , variations in @xmath186 will preferentially affect the kinematics of the outermost stars of the system , while leaving the kinematics internal to this radius comparatively unaffected ( this just reiterates the conclusions of piatek and pryor 1995 ; oh et al .",
    "we contend that our observation of a radius at which the internal kinematics of leo  i change suddenly may represent this incursion of @xmath186 into the main body of leo  i. this behavior is reflected in some of the models of mayer et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ; 2005 ) though these authors did not explore orbits quite as eccentric as we are considering for leo  i.    it is reasonable to suppose that this simple model can plausibly account for the fairly mild structural anomalies we see in leo  i , including the small shift in its photocenter as a function of surface brightness and the elongation of the distribution of kinematic members at large radii .",
    "the timing of the last perigalactic passage is also very similar to the age of the end of the last prolonged burst in the star - formation history of leo  i ( gallart et al . 1999b ; hernandez et al . 2000 ; dolphin 2002 ) , while the spatial segregation of the stellar populations suggest that this event was largely confined to the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "hybrid @xmath8-body / hydro models ( such as mayer et al .",
    "2005 ) predict that tidal stirring can result in a strong gaseous inflow in dwarf systems and centralized , bursty star formation , consistent with what we see in leo  i. the fact that population and/or chemical gradients are commonly seen in other local dwarfs ( harbeck et al . 2001 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2004 ; battaglia et al .",
    "2006 ) suggests that tidal stirring could be a common process .",
    "if we adopt @xmath187 for leo  i and retain our interpretation of @xmath162 as @xmath174 , then @xmath188 kpc for any reasonable leo  i mass and present - day tangential velocity . defining the orbital eccentricity as @xmath189 for perigalactic and apogalactic distances @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , we conclude from the results in table 8 and figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] that @xmath192 for @xmath193 kpc , the current distance of leo  i. for @xmath194 , @xmath195 kpc and @xmath196 . to the extent that equilibrium models are still valid near the core of leo  i ( read et al .",
    "2006b ; klimentowsky et al .",
    "2007 ) , we can carry out a classic ` core fitting ' analysis ( richstone and tremaine 1986 ; m98 ) using the dispersion of only the inner subsample of leo  i members . from this",
    "we derive @xmath197 , and infer @xmath198 kpc ( figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] ) and @xmath199 .",
    "these large eccentricities are consistent with the lack of strong spatial distortions in leo  i ( section  4.3.2 ; ih95 ) since it implies we are looking almost directly along the projected orbital path of the galaxy . if our interpretation of the fundamental physical origin of @xmath162 is correct , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that leo  i passed very close to the galactic center about 1 gyr ago , regardless of its dark matter content .",
    "this tidal history of leo  i implies that stars with positive velocities relative to the center of leo  i are in its leading ( western ) arm , while those with negative relative velocities are trailing ( to the east ) .",
    "s07 , whose model is broadly similar to the one we propose , came to the opposite conclusion .",
    "this appears to reflect the fact that the s07 @xmath8-body models include the results of _ two _ perigalactic passages . since we consider only the effects of the last perigalactic passage in our description , we ignore stars that may be projected onto leo  i from portions of its orbit extremely far ahead or behind the main body of the galaxy .",
    "it may be that these stars  the ones from the perigalacticon some 7 - 9 gyr ago  are the ones that contribute to the kinematic asymmetry s07 identify and interpret in their dataset .",
    "s07 adopt a static milky way potential during the entire timespan between the present epoch and the last two perigalactica of leo  i ( 7 - 9 gyr ago ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the milky way s gravitational potential may have changed significantly over that timespan ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ; bell et al . 2006",
    "; though see hammer et al .",
    "2007 ) undermining the reliability of models in which leo  i orbits in a static potential ( e.g. s07 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have so far adopted the seemingly _ ad hoc _ assumption that leo  i has had only one perigalactic passage with the milky way .",
    "this implies that leo  i was somehow injected into its present orbit sometime between the time of its last perigalactic passage ( about 1 gyr ago ) and the time of its earlier putative perigalacticon 7 - 9 gyr ago .",
    "is this plausible ?",
    "there are two aspects to this question :",
    "first , is such an orbital change  presumably the result of an interaction with a third body  reasonably probable ?",
    "if so , could such an interaction alter leo  i s orbit significantly without destroying the galaxy ? for our purposes",
    ", significant implies any change that causes leo  i to transition from an orbit with @xmath200 kpc , to one that brings it in as close as 10 kpc or so from the galactic center . from the data in table  8",
    ", we estimate that the required change of orbital energy is as large as about 6% . in the impulse approximation ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) , the energy change is approximately @xmath201 , for a perturber of mass @xmath202 and an encounter impact parameters @xmath203 . solving for @xmath203 and taking @xmath204 to be 6%  of the total energy of leo  i for an orbit that gives it @xmath205 km / s at @xmath206 kpc ( table  8)",
    ", we find that for @xmath207 , @xmath208 kpc assuming that the energy change goes entirely into altering leo  i s orbit . if we consider a population of @xmath209 subhalos within the volume of the milky way s overall halo ( @xmath210 kpc ) , then the instantaneous filling factor of those subhalos is @xmath211 .",
    "for the intermediate case above ( @xmath212 for which @xmath213 kpc ) and assuming @xmath214 , @xmath215 implying a very low probability of interaction .    but this calculation may be misleading . in hierarchical models , subhalos necessarily inhabit regions of comparatively high density right from the start , so they invariably have considerably more neighbors than in a uniform - density model . moreover , the interactions may be slow ( relative velocities between subhalos comparable to the circular velocities of individual subhalos ) , contrary to a basic assumption of the impulse approximation where the relative velocity is taken to be comparable to the ( large ) dispersion of the overall halo in which the subhalos reside . indeed ,",
    "subhalo interactions are a common feature in cdm simulations of hierarchical structure formation ( see web sites for : the center of theoretical physics , univ . of zurich ; the center for cosmological physics , univ . of chicago ; the @xmath8-body shop , univ . of washington ,",
    "seattle ) .",
    "qualitative inspection of these simulations seem to reveal that subhalos with large outward velocities become increasingly common , and that some of these cases are due to interactions with other subhalos and not the most central , parent halo .",
    "taylor and babul ( 2004 , 2005 ) explored this more quantitatively and confirmed work by tormen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and knebe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that showed that ` significant ' encounters between subhalos are indeed quite common in systems forming hierarchically . in about 5%  of the subhalo encounters ,",
    "these interactions are transformative , in the sense that either or both halos disrupt or they merge together ( taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "but there is also a class of much weaker interactions that alter orbits but not raise destructive tides ( @xmath216 in the nomenclature of taylor and babul , 2005 , where @xmath35 is the ratio @xmath217 , and @xmath218 is the radius of the peak of the rotation curve of a given subhalo ) .",
    "these are much more common than the transformative encounters , occurring at least once for 30 - 60%  of all subhalos during the formation of a milky way - sized galaxy .",
    "most of these encounters ( about 70% ; see figure 19 of taylor and babul , 2005 ) occur over the first half of the formation process of a massive galaxy , compatible with our requirement that a third - body encounter altered leo  i s orbit up to 7 - 9 gyr ago .",
    "more recently , sales et al .",
    "( 2007b ) have confirmed these basic results from independent hierarchical models .",
    "they speculate that objects such as leo  i and some other odd local group galaxies ( cetus , tucana ) may have experienced third - body encounters that could account for their unusual orbital characteristics .",
    "zhao ( 1998 ) proposed a specific interaction between the sgr dsph galaxy and the magellanic clouds 2 - 3 gyr ago to inject sgr into its current orbit .",
    "this model provides an elegant solution to the puzzle of the long - term survivability of sgr ( zhao 1998 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2006 ) , and is consistent with its detailed orbital characteristics ( majewski et al .",
    "perhaps something similar has occurred to leo  i , boosting the star formation rate and initiating its transformation into a spheroidal system ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) 7 - 9 gyr ago while simultaneously injecting it into its present orbit .",
    "this picture also addresses leo  i s survival : two close encounters with the milky way should have stripped most of its initial mass ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ; taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ; read and gilmore 2005 ) , making it difficult for the galaxy to have survived as relatively unscathed as we observe today .",
    "detailed photometric studies of leo  i reveal low - level star formation for the first third of the galaxy s existence ( gallart et al . 1999b ; hernandez et al . 2000 ; dolphin 2002 ) when leo  i may have resembled dirr system .",
    "this was followed by an increase in star formation some 5 - 8 gyr ago which ended , possibly after a final peak , about 1 gyr ago .",
    "the event that first caused the star formation rate to rise evidently did not clear the gas from leo  i since star formation continued after that epoch . nor",
    "did the event induce tidal features that we can see today in the distribution of stars in and around leo  i or in its internal kinematics .",
    "if it had , such features would by now extend over a very long arc of leo  i s present orbit and be seen as obvious photometric depth that is not observed ( section 4.3.2 ; held et al .",
    "2001 ) . in our model",
    ", we identify this event as an interaction with another subhalo , specifically _ not _ with the galactic center .",
    "we obviously require a better idea of the orbit of leo  i before we can hope to identify the third body that leo  i may have scattered off of , assuming of course that that body exists as an identifiable entity today ( taylor and babul 2004 , 2005 ; sales et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "the kinematic basis of the s07 model is their detection of a strong asymmetry in the velocity distribution of leo  i. we do not confirm this feature in our data .",
    "the velocity distribution of all leo  i members ( figure  [ figs : velhist ] ; @xmath72 ) has a skew of @xmath219 and a kurtosis of @xmath220 , both consistent with a gaussian distribution . if we select stars from our sample that are spatially distributed in the same manner as those in the s07 sample ( dashed histogram in figure  [ figs : velhist ] ) , we find no significant skew or kurtosis ( @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively ) .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the systematic errors of the s07 velocities relative to our measurements ( see section  3.2 ) contribute to their observation of an asymmetric velocity distribution .",
    "what is clear is that we see no such effect in our larger sample of more precise velocities . in the detailed @xmath8-body models by s07 , the asymmetry of the velocity distribution from their model appears to result entirely from stars that have migrated along the orbit since the penultimate perigalacticon ( about 5 - 7 gyr ) . based on s07 s reasoning ,",
    "our data ( figure  [ figs : velhist ] ) argue that this earlier perigalactic passage did not occur and adds weight to the idea that leo  i s orbit has evolved .",
    "the extent of leo  i along the line of sight offers another way of distinguishing these models .",
    "predict that leo  i should exhibit a full depth of about 30% , defined here as @xmath223 . in our description , this extent is much less , about 10 - 15% , which we estimate from the distance stars have traveled relative to the center of leo  i at a velocity of 10 km / s ( characteristic of the internal dispersion ) since perigalacticon .",
    "proper simulations are needed to determine the tidal extent reliably , but we note that this rough estimate agrees with distance range of stars extracted from leo  i during its last perigalactic passage in the s07 models . though the horizontal branch of leo  i is extended in luminosity , this seems to result mostly from its unusual star - formation history and not a distance spread ( gallart et al .",
    "as we summarized in section 4.3.2 , observations of rr  lyr stars in leo  i appear to rule out a depth greater than about 15%  ( held et al .",
    "2001 ) , arguing against the existence of significant tidal arms as predicted by s07 .",
    "distance tracers accurate to 5% are needed if we hope to detect the much more modest tidal arms hypothesized in our scenario .",
    "we predict that leo  i s proper motion should be from east to west in a heliocentric reference frame ; specific predictions are given in table  8 .",
    "these values differ significantly from the predicted proper motion reported by s07 for several reasons .",
    "first , s07 report their prediction in units of marcsec / yr , though the values appear more consistent with units of arcsec / yr . also , the predicted proper motion in s07 is stated to be heliocentric , but the signs of the two components are inconsistent with this and suggest that the values reported by s07 correspond to a galactostationary frame .",
    "note that our predicted proper motions assume the orbital pole given by s07 and rely on our interpretation that the leading side of leo  i ( west ) exhibits a net positive velocity relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( see figures  [ figs : gradient ] and [ figs : xieta2 ] ) .",
    "one final issue has to do with why we see streaming in the outer parts of leo  i ( outside the break radius , @xmath167 arcsec ) while koch et al .",
    "( 2007 ; k07 ) do not . to explore this",
    ", we carried out simulations in which the velocities of stars in our sample were assumed to have ( normal ) errors 2.0 times as large as in table 5 , mimicking the mean uncertainty of the k07 measurements . for our full dataset ,",
    "only 29%of our simulations produce by chance a larger value of @xmath145 than we observe ( figure  [ figs : deltav ] ) . when we select stars to approximate the spatial distribution of stars in the k07 sample , 30%of the simulations produce a stronger streaming signal by chance .",
    "interestingly , our data still reveal streaming outside @xmath6 arcsec even when we double the velocity uncertainties or mimic the k07 spatial distribution .",
    "it will be of useful to expand the size of the leo  i kinematic sample , particularly at and outside @xmath162 , to explore the nature of the streaming signal in leo  i further .",

    "these stars appear uniformly distributed over the field and are kinematically distinct from leo  i. the expected distribution of field stars predicted by the besancon galaxy model ( robin et al .",

    "other kinematic studies based on relatively high - resolution observations have identified possible evidence of cold kinematic groups in other halo fields ( cote et al 1992 ; ibata et al .",

    "our results give a systemic heliocentric velocity for leo  i of @xmath230 km / s , and a radial velocity dispersion for the full sample of @xmath3 km / s , both in agreement with previous measurements . the large areal coverage and significant number of stars in the present sample ( see figure  [ figs : rpa ] ) allow us to measure the radial velocity dispersion profile to slightly beyond the formal king tidal radius of leo  i ( ih95 ; table 6 ) .",
    "as we find in other dsph systems ( walker et al .",

    "we find evidence of a ` break ' radius , @xmath162 , at about @xmath237 arcsec ( 500 pc ) , where the internal kinematics of leo  i change from apparently isotropic inside this radius , to a distribution consistent with rotation or streaming along the major axis .",
    "monte - carlo simulations reveal that the statistical significance of the kinematic change is high ( @xmath238% ) .",
    "we interpret this in the framework of a heuristic model in which leo  i passed very close to the center of the milky way about 1 gyr ago .",
    "the break radius corresponds to the instantaneous tidal radius of leo  i at perigalacticon ( table  8 and figure  [ figs : tidalperi ] ) .",
    "this simple model accounts for the observed kinematic and population segregation in leo  i , the mildly distorted structural properties of the galaxy , the age and duration of the last prominent burst of star formation , and the large outward radial velocity of leo  i relative to the galactic center .",
    "the lack of gas today in the galaxy presumably reflects the fact that the ism was largely consumed by star formation in the inner part of leo  i ( inside @xmath162 ) , and stripped via ram pressure near the galactic disk outside that radius .",
    "this is consistent with our detection of population segregation in leo  i , such that younger stars predominate inside @xmath162 , while older populations are found at all radii .",
    "tidal arms would have formed in leo  i during its perigalactic passage(s ) . because of the high ellipticity of the galaxy s orbit and its large distance",
    ", we predict that these arms are projected close to the main body of the galaxy , and that they exhibit a full extent of about 10 - 15%  the distance to leo  i ( 25 - 35 kpc ) . in this picture ,",
    "the leading ( more distant ) arm is associated with stars with positive velocities relative to the center of leo  i , corresponding to the west side of the galaxy .",
    "existing observations of rr  lyr stars in leo  i appear to rule out arms that extend 20 - 30%  of the distance to the galaxy along the line of sight ( held et al .",
    "shoerter arms can not be excluded with existing observations , but could be detectable with a distance indicator capable of distance resolution of @xmath45% , such as dwarf cepheids ( mateo et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "the lack of long tidal arms is inconsistent with the simulations of s07 who argue leo  i has suffered at least two perigalactic passages in its lifetime .",
    "we speculate that leo  i may have instead been injected into its highly elliptical orbit via an interaction with a third body , similar to a more specific model in which sgr was injected into its present orbit after interacting with the lmc ( zhao 1998 ) . within the context of hierarchical models , such an interaction for leo  i is not only possible , but probable ( taylor and babul 2005 , 2005 ; sales et al .",
    "this scattering event had to have occurred between about 2 - 9 gyr ago to exclude as second close perigalactic passage of leo  i. the lack of asymmetry in the velocity distribution of our kinematic sample of leo  i members ( figure  [ figs : velhist ] ) is also consistent with only one close perigalactic passage during leo  i s lifetime ( s07 ) .",
    "it would be of interest to look for a similar effect in other satellite systems .",
    "our kinematic observations of nearly 1000 stars in carina suggest that we may see evidence of a break radius in that galaxy at comparable significance ( 97% ; walker et al .",
    "other dwarfs for which we have extensive kinematic data also show possible break radii , but at lower significance than in leo  i. this may not be entirely surprising .",
    "leo  i s exceptionally large radial velocity makes the galaxy unique , and demands a highly elliptical orbit if it is bound to the milky way ( byrd et al .",
    "1994 ; taylor et al .",
    "most other dsph systems appear to be on less extreme elliptical orbits ( piatek et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; dinescu et al .",
    "2004 ) , so the break radius may not be as well - defined as in leo  i. carina may have the next most extreme orbital eccentricity after leo  i ( @xmath239 ; piatek et al .",
    "it has long been discussed as a system with an extended pseudo - stream of stars ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ; muoz et al .",
    "2006 ) , and we may have already detected a break radius in its kinematics .",
    "carina contains dwarf cepheids ( e.g. mateo et al .",
    "1998b ) which , if identified in greater numbers and over a larger fraction of the galaxy , could be used to explore the galaxy s line - of - sight extent .    finally , it is worth noting here that the possibility that leo  i has been affected significantly by tides does not necessarily contradict our conclusion from equilibrium models that the system is dominated by dark matter . for the larger masses we derive from the nfw models , leo",
    "i would have had to pass within 10 kpc or so of the galactic center .",
    "indeed , as long as we adopt newtonian gravity , its survival in this orbit _ demands _ the existence of dark matter .",
    "if leo  i has no dark matter at all , then it could not have passed closer than about 40 kpc of the galactic center and survive .",
    "such a large perigalacticon may be problematic for models that account for the gas loss via ram - pressure stripping and consumption in tidally - induced star formation ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b , 2005 ) .",
    "measurements of precise proper motions can help settle this issue , though table 8 suggests it may prove difficult to make fine distinctions within a broad range of plausible leo  i orbits . in the meantime ,",
    "our observations suggest some obvious @xmath8-body simulations that could be designed to recreate our detailed observations of the dispersion profile and break radius in the enigmatic dwarf galaxy , leo  i ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we thank carlton pryor for calculating a range of orbits for leo  i. nelson caldwell , gabor furesz and john roll helped immensely in planning , scheduling and implementing our mmt observations , and we are grateful for their efforts .",

    "<S> we present new kinematic results for a sample of 387 stars located in and around the milky way satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo  i. these spectra were obtained with the hectochelle multi - object echelle spectrograph on the mmt , and cover the mgi / mgb lines at about 5200 . </S>",
    "<S> based on 297 repeat measurements of 108 stars , we estimate the mean velocity error ( @xmath0 ) of our sample to be 2.4 km / s , with a systematic error of @xmath1 km / s . combined with earlier results , </S>",
    "<S> we identify a final sample of 328 leo  i red giant members , from which we measure a mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath2 km / s , and a mean radial velocity dispersion of @xmath3 km / s for leo  i. the dispersion profile of leo  i is essentially flat from the center of the galaxy to beyond its classical ` tidal ' radius , a result that is unaffected by contamination from field stars or binaries within our kinematic sample . </S>",
    "<S> we have fit the profile to a variety of equilibrium dynamical models and can strongly rule out models where mass follows light . </S>",
    "<S> two - component sersic+nfw models with tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions fit the dispersion profile well , with isotropic models ruled out at a 95%  confidence level . within the projected radius sampled by our data ( @xmath4 1040 pc ) , the mass and v - band mass - to - light ratio of leo  i estimated from equilibrium models are in the ranges 5 - 7 @xmath5 and 9 - 14 ( solar units ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that leo  i members located outside a ` break radius ' at @xmath6 arcsec ( 500 pc ) exhibit significant velocity anisotropy , whereas stars interior of this radius appear consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a heuristic model in which the break radius represents the location of the tidal radius of leo  i at perigalacticon of a highly elliptical orbit . </S>",
    "<S> our scenario can account for the complex star formation history of leo  i , the presence of population segregation within the galaxy , and leo  i s large outward velocity from the milky way . within the framework of our model , the lack of extended tidal arms in leo  i </S>",
    "<S>  both perpendicular to and along the line of sight  suggests the galaxy has experienced only one perigalactic passage with the milky way ; thus , leo  i may have been injected into its present orbit by a third body a few gyr before perigalacticon . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the plausibility of this idea within the context of hierarchical models and conclude that such an interaction is entirely possible . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the possible detection of a distinct kinematic structure in the leo  i field at about a @xmath7 significance level . </S>"
