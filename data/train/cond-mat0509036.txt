    "polycrystalline ferromagnetic films a few nanometers thick are commonly used in spin - transfer devices and , in general , in spintronic applications . for instance , the spin torque effect is typically studied in devices that consist of two magnetic layers separated by a normal metal ( nm ) and two contact layers made of the same nm on top and bottom of the structure @xcite .",
    "one of the magnetic layers , about 10 nm thick , provides a spin polarized current that is used to excite and switch the magnetization of a very thin adjacent layer ( few nm ) .",
    "the threshold current density for magnetic excitations is proportional to the gilbert damping constant g , and the effective magnetization @xcite . in order to understand the physics of spin transfer",
    ", it is therefore important to characterize the magnetic properties and magnetic relaxation of ultrathin films .",
    "fmr is a sensitive technique to study magnetic ultrathin films .",
    "it provides information on the magnetization density , the magnetic anisotropy and the damping .",
    "the precession of the magnetization @xmath9 about an effective field @xmath10 is described by the landau - lifshitz equation . for a polycrystalline film that is magnetically saturated in the film plane , the resonance condition is @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is proportional to g , the land g - factor .",
    "the effective field @xmath13m@xmath14 is defined as @xcite : @xmath15 the last term of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] is the surface anisotropy field .",
    "it characterizes a thickness dependent anisotropy associated with interface anisotropy and/or strain - magnetoelastic interactions .",
    "another parameter of importance in fmr is the linewidth .",
    "the full width at half power @xmath16 is commonly fitted to @xcite : @xmath17 the constant @xmath18 is a phenomenological term related to inhomogeneous broadening of the fmr line . the slope of @xmath19 is directly proportional to the gilbert damping constant .",
    "the two terms , @xmath18 and the slope , are referred to as the extrinsic and intrinsic contribution to the linewidth respectively .    in this paper , we compare the fmr response of ferromagnetic ultrathin films grown by evaporation and by sputtering .",
    "we first discuss the sample fabrication and the experimental set up .",
    "then the thickness dependence of @xmath20 and g will be presented and analyzed .",
    "the samples are made of a single polycrystalline co layer embedded between two pt / cu bilayers .",
    "two series of samples were fabricated by evaporation and sputtering .",
    "the samples were prepared in a uhv system with a base pressure of @xmath21 torr on polished semi - insulating gaas ( 001 ) substrate of 350 @xmath22 m thickness . for the evaporated films ,",
    "an e - beam was used to evaporate the pt layers and the co layers .",
    "the cu layers were deposited using thermal evaporation .",
    "the second set of films were made using magnetron sputtering .",
    "those films have a thicker pt layer ( 5 nm ) than the evaporated films ( 1.5 nm ) . in both series of samples , the ferromagnetic layer thickness varied from 1 nm to 10 nm , while the cu layer thickness was kept fixed at 10 nm .",
    "the fmr measurements were carried out at room temperature using a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) , designed to have a 50 @xmath23 impedance within a broad frequency range ( up to 25 ghz ) .",
    "the device was fabricated on a similar gaas wafer than the films employing a bi - layer photoresist .",
    "the metallic layer is made of 1.5 nm pt for adhesion , and 200 nm au .",
    "the waveguide , 4 mm long , has a transmission line of 50 @xmath22 m width and a gap to the ground lines of 32 @xmath22 m .",
    "the two ends of the line were directly connected to the ports of an agilent network analyzer .",
    "the cpw was employed as an ac magnetic field generator with the assumption that the dominant mode was the tem mode , and as an inductive sensor .",
    "samples were placed directly on top of the cpw ( flip - chip ) , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . a dc magnetic field ( up to 4.5 koe ) , generated by an electromagnet was directed along the axis of the transmission line and perpendicular to the ac magnetic field .",
    "the dc applied field was measured with a hall probe sensor , that was calibrated using epr on dpph , a spin 1/2 system .",
    "all the measurements were done with the dc field and the ac field aligned in the plane of the film . the absorption line from 4 ghz to 25 ghz",
    "was measured by monitoring the relative change in the transmitted power as a function of the applied magnetic field . as will be shown below",
    ", the technique is sensitive enough to enable fmr studies in co magnetic layers as thin as 1 nm .    the normalized absorption curve at 13 ghz for a selection of pt / cu / co / cu / pt films , where the magnetic layer is ( a ) 5 nm , ( b ) 3 nm and ( c ) 1.5 nm thick .",

    "typical absorption lines at 13 ghz of a selection of pt / cu / co / cu / pt evaporated and sputtered films are shown in fig .",
    "the normalized data were obtained by subtracting the background signal and dividing by the relative change in power at resonance .",
    "the absorption lines are lorentzians , with a slight asymmetry observed at certain frequencies . for each film ,",
    "the effective magnetic field @xmath20 and the g - factor was deduced from the best fit of the experimental data , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 , to eq .",
    "for the two series , the g - factor does not exhibit a clear thickness dependence . within the error bars , the average values of g for the evaporated and sputtered films are practically equal , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , this is about @xmath29 larger than the value reported in the literature for fcc co films ( g@xmath30 ) @xcite .",

    "the solid and dash line are fits of the experimental data based on eq .",
    "the insets ( a ) and ( b ) shows @xmath31 and the g - factor versus thickness , respectively.,width=188 ]    the effective fields exhibit a clear thickness dependence : decreasing about 6 koe when the co layer thickness is decreased from 10 nm to 1 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the best fit to the experimental data with eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] gives the surface anisotropy constant for e - beam films @xmath32erg/@xmath33 and for sputtered films @xmath34erg/@xmath33 .",
    "the negative sign reflects a perpendicular magnetic surface anisotropy . within the error bar ,",
    "the surface anisotropy is practically independent of the film deposition technique .",
    "in contrast , the sputtered films exhibit a larger magnetization density , @xmath35emu/@xmath36 , compared to the films prepared by evaporation @xmath37emu/@xmath36 .",
    "those values are smaller than the bulk magnetization density of fcc cobalt  1400 emu/@xmath36 .",
    "the results are in good agreement with previous work conducted on @xmath38 co/2.5 nm cu ( 111 ) epitaxial superlattices ( @xmath39 nm ) grown on gaas(110 ) wafer @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was found that those films exhibit a surface anisotropy constant @xmath40 erg/@xmath33 and have a density of magnetization of 1241 emu/@xmath36 on average .",
    "the full width at half power @xmath16 was also studied as a function of the frequency .",
    "the linewidth increases linearly with frequency from 10 ghz to 25 ghz for both evaporated and sputtered films .",
    "[ fig3]a shows the thickness dependence of @xmath16 for data recorded at 14 ghz .",
    "the linewidth is significantly enhanced for films with co thickness below 5 nm .",
    "following eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , the parameters @xmath41 and the slope @xmath42 were extracted .",
    "the two contributions to the linewidth exhibit similar thickness dependence , characterized by a strong increase for co layers thinner than 5 nm ( inset of fig .",

    "( b ) the gilbert damping versus the co layer thickness @xmath38 , deduced from the slope @xmath42 .",
    "the top inset shows the intercept @xmath18 versus thickness .",
    "the lower inset shows the slope @xmath43 versus thickness.,width=302 ]    @xmath18 is close to 0 oe for films with co layer thicker than 5 nm , and it reaches 200 oe when the ferromagnetic layer is 1 nm thick .",
    "the slope is about constant for @xmath444 nm , and it increases by a factor 3 for the thinnest film .",
    "the gilbert damping constant was estimated from eq .  [ eq3 ] and its thickness dependence is shown in fig .",
    "we used the average g - factor and the magnetization of saturation obtained from the study of the thickness dependence of the effective field .",
    "the sputtered and evaporated films have equivalent damping constant for thick co layers . however , with decreasing fm layer thickness , g increases more rapidly for sputtered films than for evaporated films .",
    "the enhancement of the damping for the ultrathin ferromagnetic films can be interpreted in terms of the spin pumping effect .",
    "brataas and co - workers recently proposed a mechanism for additional gilbert damping in nm / fm / nm structures , where the nm layers are two perfect spin sinks @xcite . in this case , the additional damping scales inversely with the thickness of the fm layer : @xmath45 where g@xmath46 is the bulk damping and g@xmath47 is the spin mixing conductance at the fm / nm interface .",
    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath48 s@xmath49 and g@xmath50 @xmath51 for the evaporated films , and g@xmath52 s@xmath49 and g@xmath53 @xmath51 for the sputtered films .",
    "the method of deposition has practically no effect on g@xmath46 . for the spin mixing conductance",
    ", there is a difference in the result for sputtered and evaporated films .",
    "the value of the spin mixing conductance of the sputtered films is close to the value calculated for a clean co / cu interface , reported in ref.@xcite ( g@xmath54 @xmath51 ) . for the evaporated films , g@xmath47 is about two times smaller .",
    "[ eq4 ] is valid for a system where the nm layers are perfect spin sinks , i.e. the angular momentum generated by the magnetization in precession diffuses and is dissipated in the nm layers .",
    "_ showed that the linewidth of cu / py / cu / pt sputtered films decreases with pt layer thickness decreasing below 1.5 nm @xcite . therefore",
    ", the smaller value of g@xmath47 found for the evaporated films compared to the sputtered films could be explained by the thin pt layers that do not act as perfect spin sinks .",
    "the results suggest that the spin diffusion length of pt at room temperature is around 2 nm .",
    "another mechanism that gives rise to the broadening of the linewidth with decreasing thickness is the two - magnon scattering mechanism .",
    "arias and mills calculated that this contribution is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the interface magnetic anisotropy , and so scales as 1/@xmath57 with @xmath58 @xcite . a log - log plot of the thickness dependence of the linewidth at 14 ghz , for instance , for sputtered and evaporated films gives @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , we conducted fmr measurements on films without pt layers , and with co thickness layer of 2 and 3 gffnm .",
    "the gilbert damping is about the value found for the thickest films with pt layers ( to be published ) .",
    "therefore , the two - magnon scattering mechanism does not appear relevant to understanding the thickness dependence of @xmath16 .",
    "polycrystalline pt / cu / co / cu / pt ultrathin films exhibit smaller magnetization density compared to the bulk material .",
    "futhermore , sputtered films exhibit a larger magnetization of saturation compared to the evaporated films .",
    "in contrast , the interface anisotropy is not affected by the deposition technique .",
    "the linewidth increases strongly with thickness decreasing below 4 nm .",
    "the estimated gilbert damping shows similar behaviour .",
    "the spin mixing conductance at co / cu interface was calculated and found to be smaller for evaporated films with a pt layer of 1.5 nm than for sputtered films that have a pt layer of 5 nm ."
