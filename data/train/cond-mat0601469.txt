    "`` half - doped '' manganites , corresponding to the general formula re@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 with @xmath3 where re is a 3 + rare - earth metal ion and a a 2 + alkaline earth metal ion , eg . ,",
    "la@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 , have been the object of extensive experimental and theoretical studies for many years.@xcite here each mn has an average valence of @xmath5 i.e. , an average configuration of @xmath6 , corresponding to one mn-@xmath7 electron for every two mn sites hopping around amongst the two [ @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath7 orbitals on each mn .",
    "the remaining three @xmath10 electrons on each mn are spin - aligned by strong correlations ( hund s rules ) to form `` core spins '' with @xmath11 .",
    "similarly to the end members , i.e. , lamno@xmath2 or camno@xmath2 , the half - doped compounds , thanks to their commensurate filling , are simpler in some ways than the doped manganites for general @xmath12.@xcite nevertheless , they exhibit a very rich variety of properties as well.@xcite specifically , as the system is cooled , there are phase transitions involving changes in magnetic , charge and orbital order , and , in some cases , metalicity .",
    "the details vary from material to material , depending systematically on the sizes of the `` a site '' ions of the perovskite structure .",
    "generally , the lowest temperature phase is insulating , with simultaneous charge , orbital and ce type antiferromagnetic order ( see below ) , and the charge / orbital order sets in first , at higher temperatures , compared to the antiferromagnetic order ( _ e.g. _ , for prca @xmath13 , whereas @xmath14@xcite ) .",
    "the ndsr and prsr systems show ferromagnetic metallic order at intermediate temperatures , but in the laca and prca systems , the different phases obtained with increasing temperature continue to be insulating .",
    "typically , the charge order and insulating behaviour at low temperatures persist on the `` over - doped '' side ( @xmath15 ) , whereas the charge order disappears rather quickly on the `` under - doped '' side ( @xmath16 ) , and is often accompanied by metalicity ( except in the prca system , which stays insulating for all @xmath12 ) .",
    "this asymmetry between `` electron doping '' and `` hole doping '' away from half - doping is a striking feature of the majority of the half - doped manganites .",
    "one simplifying feature of the half - doped manganites is that the low temperature phase is generally regarded as reasonably well characterised .",
    "early neutron diffraction work by wollan and koehler@xcite suggested that the magnetic structure of la@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 can be viewed as a set of ferromagnetic zig - zag chains antiferromagnetically ordered relative to each other , with an 8-sublattice , ( @xmath17 ) unit cell , and is referred to as the ce magnetic order ( fig .",
    "[ ce - phase - f ] ) .",
    "the structure was qualitatively explained soon thereafter by goodenough,@xcite who proposed additionally that the phase also has a 2-sublattice , @xmath18 charge order with alternating mn@xmath19 and mn@xmath20 sites , and a 4-sublattice , @xmath21 striped orbital order , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ ce - phase - f ] . since then",
    ", ce order has been found in several other half - doped systems , such as nd@xmath4sr@xmath4mno@xmath22@xcite or nd@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2@xcite , though some , such as pr@xmath4sr@xmath4mno@xmath2,@xcite show a - type antiferromagnetism , corresponding to @xmath23 $ ] spin order , i.e , ferromagnetic planes of spins which are antiferromagnetically aligned in the z - direction ) .",
    "the presence of charge and orbital order is , however , harder to establish directly experimentally because of the lack of experimental probes that couple directly to them .",
    "indeed , the perfect mn@xmath19/mn@xmath20 charge ordering proposed by goodenough.@xcite is currently regarded as controversial@xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction data do suggest the presence of large jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the mn sites@xcite with two inequivalent mn sites , of effective valence @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but @xmath26 is not really known , and is unlikely to be close to 0.5 . in pr@xmath27ca@xmath28mno@xmath2 ( which is slightly under - doped though ) , the charge or valence contrast seems further reduced , and it has been suggested on the basis of neutron diffraction data that the electron is rather shared by two mn sites paired in dimer - like structures , referred to as `` zener polarons '' , with ( @xmath29).@xcite it is not clear , however , whether this is due to the presence of additional electrons@xcite or a general feature of many half - doped manganites.@xcite a recent work on pr@xmath30ca@xmath30mno@xmath2 claims indeed to confirm the picture of the original ce state at precisely half - filling.@xcite an alternate , closely related picture of the half - doped system is that of a bond - charge - density - wave , with no charge contrast of the mn ions , substantial hole occupancy on the oxygen ions on the chains , and alternating `` o@xmath31/o@xmath32 '' order.@xcite there have been x - ray studies on orbital order and correlations as well as charge and magnetic order using a variety of methods such as soft x - ray resonant diffraction,@xcite coherent x - ray scattering,@xcite which explore the spatial extent of orbital order , in particular . the resonant scattering experiments in pr@xmath27ca@xmath28mno@xmath2 conclude that the charge disproportionation is less than complete , that there is orbital mixing , and that therefore the simple goodenough model is not right . on the other hand , when holes are in excess ( @xmath33 ) , it has been suggested that charge order persists but becomes incommensurate.@xcite    a closely related family of manganites carefully studied recently is a@xmath30a@xmath30mno@xmath2 where a is a rare earth ( y , tb , sm , nd , pr , la in order of ion size ) and a is ba.@xcite the phases have been studied as a function of a - a site order / disorder . when there is order , the low temperature phase is charge - ordered ( co ) and orbitally ordered ( oo ) for ion size from y to nd . beyond nd",
    ", up to la , the phase is a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "however , when a - a sites are disordered , there is no co phase at all , but only a spin glass ( sg ) phase , from y to sm , after which the ground state is ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "this means that the co / fm and co / sg competition depends on ion size as well on a site ordering in the perovskite abo@xmath2 structure .",
    "another interesting and intriguing property of the ce charge - ordered ( ce - co ) phase is the magnetic - field - induced insulator - metal transition first discovered in ( nd , sm)@xmath4sr@xmath4mno@xmath2,@xcite and later shown to be ubiquitous@xcite .",
    "though insulating at zero field , these materials become metallic by the application of magnetic - fields of the order of 10 - 40 tesla via sharp , first - order , resistive transitions.@xcite the magnetic - field energies involved are much smaller than the thermal energies ( of order 200 k ) needed to destroy the charge order , and orders of magnitude smaller than the charge gap of 0.2 - 0.3 ev , as observed as a function of field by stm in nd@xmath30sr@xmath30mno@xmath2.@xcite this can be viewed as a different manifestation of the colossal magneto - resistance seen at the metal - insulator transition of doped manganites for @xmath34,@xcite and the microscopic understanding of the above features poses similar difficult theoretical challenges.@xcite    _ theory_. a variety of models and mechanisms have been examined in the context of half - doped manganites as well.@xcite the simplest model has mobile electrons moving amongst _ non - degenerate _",
    "orbitals , coupled to the mn @xmath10 core spins by a large hund s rule ( double ) exchange coupling @xmath35 .",
    "the latter promotes ferromagnetism , but competes with a direct antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath36 between the core spins . even in this simple model , the ferromagnetic or ce types of order",
    "are stabilised depending upon the strength of @xmath36.@xcite van den brink _",
    "considered a more realistic model with the two types of @xmath7 orbitals of mn , and found that the ce phase is orbitally - ordered : the `` bridge sites '' of the zig - zag chains have alternating preferred occupancy of @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals@xcite as indicated in fig .",
    "[ ce - phase - f ] .",
    "they also showed that a charge contrast @xmath26 ( not bigger than 0.2 ) can be generated by including on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "this is because the `` corner sites '' turn out to have equal occupancy of @xmath8 and @xmath39 orbitals , and that costs coulomb energy . to reduce this",
    ", the system adopts a preferred occupancy of the bridge sites which are orbitally ordered .",
    "in later work , nearest neighbour coulomb interactions were also included.@xcite however , the charge order due to long - range coulomb interactions is generally of the wigner - type with wave vector @xmath40 , contrary to the @xmath41 order , with charge stacking along the z - direction , suggested by experiment . to stabilise the @xmath41 order in a wider regime of parameters , jt interactions between the mn ions and their surrounding oxygen octahedra , which are supposed to be quite large,@xcite have to be included.@xcite the consequent jt distortions further lower the energy of the ce phase because of the already present @xmath42 orbital order .",
    "classical monte carlo simulations including static jt distortions on small clusters as well as self - consistent mean field treatments of models including jt and coulomb interactions@xcite suggest that the ce charge stacked state has the lowest energy in an intermediate range of @xmath36 , unless the nearest neighbour coulomb interaction @xmath43 becomes much too large .    however , to our knowledge very few of these studies have addressed the other issues , such as the magnetic - field - induced insulator metal transition , and the electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "the first issue was tackled in refs .",
    "[ ] by assuming model parameters very close to the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic and ce states . the resulting small energy difference between the two phases can then be overcome by an arbitrary small magnetic - field .",
    "but it is hard to justify why the system parameters should be so finely tuned for so many systems .",
    "as regards the second issue , band structure arguments,@xcite and treatments including jt distortions on small clusters@xcite necessarily lead to metallic phases upon addition of electrons or holes , in contrast to experiments .",
    "recently , a theory for doped manganites has been proposed@xcite where it is argued that due to strong jt interactions the @xmath7 electrons dynamically reorganise themselves into two types .",
    "the majority of the electrons ( labelled @xmath44 ) become localised polarons , trapped by large local jt distortions ; and a minority of them ( labelled @xmath45 ) can remain mobile and non - polaronic . still virtual adiabatic transitions to empty neighbouring sites",
    "induces a ferromagnetic exchange referred as _ virtual _",
    "double exchange.@xcite the resulting falicov - kimball like , @xmath46 model hamiltonian treated in a simple dynamical mean - field treatment in the framework of an `` orbital liquid '' description , gave a good account of the properties of doped manganites.@xcite    in this paper , we propose an extension of the above theory to the half doped case , which has to include the possibilities for orbital , charge , and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we obtain pointers to this by studying the properties of electronic excitations _ coupled with jt defects _ in the lattice distortion pattern .",
    "we find that such a study suggests the incipient instabilities of the ce phase indicative of the doping and magnetic - field induced phase transitions seen experimentally , as well as the presence of localised and mobile carriers .",
    "the localised states on the defects which we obtain are different from the microferrons suggested at small @xmath12 around a dopant,@xcite as they are self - generated and could exist even in the absence of chemical disorder . in principle",
    ", the jt defects we are considering could be mobile on a longer time - scale , although disorder may indeed pin them down .",
    "more specifically , in this paper , we first determine the zero temperature phase diagram of the 3d two - orbital model of half - doped manganites for periodic phases in the _ thermodynamic limit _ , including jt distortions , but ignoring coulomb interactions .",
    "we do this by minimising the energy assuming a periodic unit - cell of eight sites,@xcite inside which static jt distortions and core spin directions are allowed to be arbitrary .",
    "this allows us to determine them self - consistently without using finite - size clusters , thereby extending and reinforcing earlier work.@xcite in particular we obtain analytic results for the phase boundaries at strong jt coupling .",
    "next , we show that the periodic ferromagnetic phase obtained at small @xmath36 by the method discussed above can become unstable with respect to a phase with two types ( @xmath46 ) of electrons when the jt coupling is lowered .",
    "we show indeed that it becomes energetically favourable to create single site jt defects , i.e. release the distortion on a finite number of sites that were previously distorted and promote previously trapped electrons onto a mobile band , thus suggesting a metallic phase .",
    "the exact nature of the phase can not be figured out by such an instability analysis .",
    "nonetheless , it suggests an effective ( @xmath46 ) hamiltonian with orbital degrees of freedom explicitly included .",
    "the observed phases at half - doping , such as the ce phase , are antiferromagnetic , corresponding to appropriately larger values of @xmath36 .",
    "but they show transitions to ferromagnetic metallic phases in an external magnetic - field or when electrons are added . to understand such transitions , in addition to considering changes in the jt distortions , canting of spins",
    "is important .",
    "canted phases are expected to appear not only in a magnetic - field , but also upon doping with carriers ( and irrespective of their nature ) , following the original argument by de gennes.@xcite here we show , however , that canted metallic phases appear only when _ electrons _ ( and not holes ) are added , because of the underlying asymmetry of the density of states at half - doping .",
    "when we allow for jt distortions , we find a competition with a disordered phase where the added electrons are trapped by jt distortions , the latter phase winning only at small electron concentration . on the hole - doped side , added holes are simply trapped by the lattice distortions and the system remains insulating .",
    "thus our work provides an explanation for the particle - hole asymmetry near @xmath47 , at intermediate jt couplings which we argue are relevant for the majority of the manganites .",
    "similarly , we find that there is a strong interplay between turning on a magnetic - field at half doping and the jt distortion pattern .",
    "this is consistent with x - ray measurements in la@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 in a field.@xcite starting from the distorted ce phase , we find in addition an instability of the high - field ferromagnetic phase to the formation of jt defects .",
    "this suggests that the high - field phase seen in experiments may need a two - fluid description .",
    "interestingly , a very similar two - carrier hypothesis was proposed based on phenomenological grounds to understand the resistivity of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath47).@xcite more recently , a particle - hole asymmetric ginzburg - landau theory was proposed to explain@xcite the incommensurate charge order@xcite seen for @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that our theory provides the microscopic basis for these facts both .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ pd - s ] ,",
    "we discuss the phase diagram of the half - doped manganites restricted to periodic ground states with the most general 8-sublattice structure .",
    "we give in particular an analytic strong - coupling description ( [ wannier - ss ] ) . in section",
    "[ instabilities - s ] , we study the instabilities of some of these phases : instability of the strong jt coupling ferromagnetic phase , which defines a new phase ( [ instabilityferro - ss ] ) ; instability upon doping to the canted phases ( [ doping - ss - canted ] ) or to self - trapping of added carriers ( [ doping - ss - trapped ] ) , and the competition between the two ( [ competionbetweenthetwo ] ) . the effect of the magnetic - field on the ce phase is studied in section [ mag - f - ss ] , where we also discuss the nature of the high - field ferromagnetic phase . in section [ conclusion - s ] , we summarise and discuss the possibilities for testing these ideas experimentally",

    "the original lattice is decomposed into eight sublattices , labelled with @xmath50.@xcite there are @xmath54 sites and @xmath55 electrons ( when @xmath3 the number of electrons is denoted @xmath56 ) .",
    "the first term is the kinetic energy of the electrons .",
    "the hopping parameters are taken to be of the usual anderson - hasegawa form@xcite which takes care of the hund s coupling , @xmath57 in the limit of large @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , the @xmath11 core spin formed from the mn @xmath10 electrons being approximated as a classical spin . as a consequence only the electrons with spin projections parallel to the core spins are present , and their hopping amplitudes are functions of the polar angles of the core spins given by:@xcite @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the usual , anisotropic and symmetry determined , hopping amplitude@xcite between the @xmath7 orbitals @xmath62 and @xmath63 at the two nearest neighbour sites @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , arising from their hybridisation with the @xmath66 orbitals ( with @xmath67 being the hopping between @xmath39 orbitals in the @xmath68-direction)@xcite . the second term",
    "@xmath36 is the antiferromagnetic coupling of the @xmath10 core spins that comes from standard superexchange processes.@xcite it can be roughly estimated from the nel temperature of a system with only @xmath10 core spins , such as camno@xmath2 , although the structure of the half - doped system is not exactly the same .",
    "the third term is the zeeman energy where @xmath69 is the external magnetic - field .",
    "the last two terms include the jahn - teller ( jt ) phonons and their coupling to the @xmath7 electrons .",
    "we neglect the @xmath70 terms since @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the typical phonon frequency ) , but _ include their effects heuristically when we argue that jt defects lead to polaron formation_. @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the amplitude ( measured in units of the typical jt distortions in these materials ) and the angle of the jt distortion at the site @xmath64 .",
    "the coupling matrix is given by :    @xmath75    @xmath76 is the lattice stiffness of a simplified non - cooperative model where distortions on neighbouring sites are not coupled .",
    "more detailed and realistic models would include cooperative jt couplings and coupling to breathing modes such as in the lattice model of ref .",
    "we have neglected the on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath77 between different orbital states .",
    "although it is an important interaction in the problem , we can not treat it using the methods used in this paper except in a mean - field approximation .",
    "however , it is effectively taken into account when orbital order occurs .",
    "we comment on the effects of its inclusion at appropriate places in the paper . when a local jt distortion occurs on a site , the degeneracy of the @xmath7 orbitals is lifted .",
    "if only one electron is present , there is a gain by occupying the lowest energy level . if a second electron is added , however , it has to occupy the higher energy level because of the strong hund s coupling .",
    "there is a compensation and the energy gain vanishes .",
    "jt distortions therefore suppress double occupancy of sites , mimicking the effect of @xmath78 . when @xmath79 , the distortions are small or zero and it is important to explicitly include @xmath78 , which does play a role .",
    "for instance , it induces a charge - ordering in the ce phase,@xcite just as a finite @xmath80 does.@xcite when @xmath81 ( see section [ wannier - ss ] ) , jt distorted phases appear naturally , and the inclusion of @xmath78 is not crucial .",
    "similarly , the inclusion of the term @xmath82 is unimportant ( completely irrelevant when @xmath83 ) because the large hund s coupling prevents double occupancy of this type .",
    "we have also neglected the longer range coulomb interactions as they are expected to be weak because of the large dielectric constant of the manganites , and we do not consider issues ( such as macroscopic phase separation ) which are sensitive to their presence .",
    "note also that regarding the direct coupling of the @xmath10 spins , we restrict ourselves to a pure heisenberg superexchange coupling . this may not be absolutely accurate for @xmath11 spins .",
    "further couplings , such as single - ion anisotropies , are certainly present in the real materials , but are not of crucial importance for the issues we focus on in this paper .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .      the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) represents mobile electrons coupled to local classical degrees of freedom that act like _ annealed disorder_. the probability weight of a particular configuration of the classical variables is given by @xmath84 $ ] where @xmath85 is the electronic free energy in the presence of that configuration ; their distribution thus has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "at zero temperature , it is reasonable to assume that the classical degrees of freedom are frozen and have well - defined values . on a finite lattice",
    "these can , in principle , be determined as follows .",
    "one can diagonalise the hamiltonian exactly for a given ( arbitrary ) configuration of lattice distortions @xmath86 and polar angles of the spins @xmath87 ( for simplicity we are ignoring the azimuthal angles of the spins @xmath88 ) . for each configuration , one can thus find the electronic energy levels , fill up the states up to the fermi energy , and calculate the total energy . to obtain the ground state of the system ,",
    "one then needs to minimise this energy with respect to all the possible configurations of classical variables .",
    "such a procedure can be implemented , for example , using a monte - carlo technique@xcite for a finite lattice , but becomes a more and more difficult task as the number of lattice sites , and hence the number of variables , increases .",
    "since our aim is to explore the physics of the experimentally observed ce state , we adopt a simpler approach .",
    "we assume a 8-sublattice periodic structure that is compatible with the periodicity of the ce state , which permits us to tackle the problem in a lower dimensional space of the classical variables .",
    "[ needless to say , this rules out the possibility of incommensurate ( with respect to the assumed eight sublattice structure ) or inhomogeneous phases .",
    "] we have implemented a simulated annealing routine to minimise the total energy with respect to ( essentially all possible ) distortions and spin angles on the 8-sublattices .",
    "thus our approach differs from and is complementary to earlier numerical approaches which have considered small clusters and done a full classical monte - carlo simulation for the spin and lattice variables.@xcite for us , the only limitation is the number of sublattices , which we fix to be eight ; the system size is vastly larger ( we are treating the real 3d case ) , and practically in the thermodynamic limit . [ the system size , i.e , the total number of sites , is 8 times the number of periodic repetitions of blocks of 8 sites ( the spin and distortions being the same in all the blocks ) , and we have done calculations using up to 6912 blocks . ]",
    "the computational effort of such an approach compared with that of ref .",
    "[ ] is , on one hand , much reduced because we do not have to equilibrate a large number of variables . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation of the energy of each configuration takes more time because we sum over a large number of k - points ( equal to the number of blocks ) in the brillouin zone corresponding to the periodic structure .",
    "we have carefully studied the finite - size effects on these brillouin zone sums .",
    "the error on the total energy due to the truncation of the sums is of the order of @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the typical energy scale of the problem .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is therefore reached within this accuracy , i.e. , for all the phases compatible with the sublattice structure we expect that our results are within 1% of the thermodynamic limit results .",
    "figure [ pd - f ] shows the phase diagram as a function of the jt coupling , @xmath80 , and the antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath91 , at zero temperature .",
    "[ we choose units such that the jt distortions are dimensionless , whence k and g both have dimensions of energy , which we specify in units of t. we use a fixed @xmath92 . to compare with earlier work , the jt energy is then @xmath93 .",

    "this is reminiscent of the first - order transition line between two canted states when additional electrons are added ( section [ doping - ss ] and fig .",
    "[ phase diagram - f ] ) .",
    "we note that the first - order transition field is very small , @xmath238 , not only because , with @xmath239 the system is close to the phase boundary , but also because the canted phases reduce the critical field considerably .",
    "previous works that have assumed that the insulator - metal transitions involve the fully ferromagnetic state@xcite would predict a transition field @xmath240 for the same @xmath36 we have used above . we discuss in detail next as to how these features change with respect to turning on @xmath95 ( and keeping the same @xmath36 ) .      to start with we take the ce phase with the optimal lattice distortions found in section [ pd - s ] for different values of @xmath80 .",
    "first , we _ freeze the distortions _ for all magnetic - fields and find the optimal canting angle that minimises the energy as a function of the magnetic - field , for non - zero values of @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ magnetization - f ] ) .",
    "the jumps in the canting angle correspond to first - order transitions between states with small and large canting angles .",
    "when @xmath80 is increased , the transition fields and the fields at which the fully ferromagnetic state is reached shift rather quickly to larger values .",
    "the transition field becomes larger simply because , with increasing @xmath80 ( and for the same @xmath36 ) , the system moves further and further away from the phase boundary with the ferromagnetic phase ( see the phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ pd - f ] ) .",
    "we next show that the threshold fields for the `` melting '' of the ce phase are reduced by taking into account the effect of the magnetic - field on the lattice distortions themselves .",
    "one should expect this , since in section [ pd - s ] it was shown that the ferromagnetic phases remains undistorted up to @xmath217 .",
    "it is made explicit in fig .",
    "[ eh - f ] , where the energy of the _ undistorted _ highly - canted state ( solid line ) , which merge into the fully ferromagnetic state ( dashed line ) at higher fields , crosses that of the _ distorted _ canted ce states .",
    "these transitions occur at smaller transition fields ( see fig .",
    "[ eh - f ] ) compared with the transition fields we considered in the previous paragraph ( the latter correspond to the cusps , visible in the curves @xmath242 in fig . [ eh - f ] ) .",
    "the new magnetisation curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] , top .",
    "we then calculate the band structure as a function of the magnetic field and extract the gap ( fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] , bottom ) .",
    "the jumps in the magnetisation and in the gaps turn out to be simultaneous , thus indicating that the transitions correspond to insulator - metal transitions .",
    "the transition fields @xmath243 vary in the range @xmath244 for @xmath239 .",
    "the smaller the @xmath80 the smaller the transition field at fixed @xmath36 .",
    "the first - order transitions discussed above were obtained by considering the crossing of two solutions , namely the _ distorted _ canted ce phase ( with the distortions frozen at their @xmath245 values ) and the _ undistorted _ fm phase .",
    "it is possible , in principle , that intermediate phases with intermediate distortions appear . to rule out this possibility",
    ", we have performed the full optimisation in presence of the external magnetic - field for @xmath246 and found that the decrease in the distortions is less than @xmath247 up to the transition to the undistorted ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this validates our approximation of using frozen distortions in the canted ce phase up to the first - order transition .",
    "+    we can roughly understand some of the above results in terms of an expansion of the physical quantities in the canting angle , before the first - order transition takes place .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the distortions on the corner sites of the ce state , so that the zero - energy states are degenerate to start with .",
    "the degeneracy is then lifted by the canting and the reduced charge gap is given at first order in the canting angle by : @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the gap of the uncanted ce phase , given by equation ( [ gap ] ) , and @xmath250 a numerical coefficient ( from eq . [ dispersionzeroband ] ) .",
    "the canting angle itself is determined by minimising the magnetic energy per spin due to canting , given for small @xmath176 by : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the spin stiffness we have referred to before ( section [ doping - ss ] ) .",
    "the energy is minimal for @xmath253 , which describes the linear regime of the curves in fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] , before the first - order transitions to the highly canted states take place .",
    "the corresponding charge gap , given by @xmath254 also decreases linearly with field , but is not a very good approximation to the results of fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] , bottom .",
    "the difference comes from the small distortions on the corner sites which we neglected in deriving ( [ gapphi ] ) by assuming degenerate zero - energy states . with small distortions on the corner sites ,",
    "the zero - energy states are no longer degenerate , and that would modify the expression for the gap ( [ gapphi ] ) .    in any case , one can give an _ upper bound _ for the critical magnetic - field by extrapolating the linear expression ( [ gapdh ] ) to zero .",
    "this is an upper bound because the actual transition occurs before the gap get completely closed as is clear from fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] .",
    "we have    @xmath255    it is clear from this expression that in order to close a gap @xmath249 of order @xmath219 or @xmath90 , we do not need a magnetic - field of order @xmath249 thanks to the reducing factor @xmath256 .",
    "@xmath256 is small , first because the spins are easy to polarise on energy scales that have nothing to do with the charge scales , as in the standard field - induced insulator - metal transition of a spin - density wave .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large field @xmath257 is the critical field to align antiferromagnetic spins coupled only by @xmath36 .",
    "the real transition fields are substantially reduced compared to this by the double exchange included in @xmath258 and the factor @xmath259 which describes how fast the gap closes with the canting angle .",
    "for example , the strength of the transitions fields of fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgap - f ] are in the range @xmath260 . with @xmath261 ev , we have @xmath262 mev , or @xmath263 tesla , which are still much too large .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy below .",
    "we now consider the other situation with @xmath264 .",
    "for @xmath265 we have seen that even the ferromagnetic phases are insulating .",
    "hence it is to be expected that no insulator - metal transition can take place in this regime . instead , the ce phase makes a transition to the ferromagnetic insulating phase for sufficiently large fields , as is clear from the large @xmath80 limit phase diagram discussed in section [ wannier - ss ] . for @xmath266 , however , we have shown earlier that it is favourable to create defects and mobile electrons out of the fi - co phase ( section [ instabilityferro - ss ] ) .",
    "we expect therefore that similar kinds of phases will be favoured by a magnetic - field as well .",
    "we explore this issue further below , taking @xmath267 as an example .",
    "we first compare the energy of the canted distorted ce phase [ with the usual @xmath42 orbital ordering ] with that of a canted phase with alternate sites distorted in such a way as to favour the @xmath8 orbital ordering .",
    "the latter is indeed a lower energy state for large @xmath80 when the spins are fully aligned , compared with the undistorted phase .",
    "we see in the inset of fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgapg6-f ] that the two energies cross for @xmath268 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgapg6-f ] , at this field the canting angle that minimises the energy jumps from @xmath269 to @xmath236 corresponding to a transition to the fully ferromagnetic state ( which is metallic at @xmath270 , see fig .",
    "[ chargegap - f ] ) with @xmath8 orbital ordering .",
    "+    we now consider the possibility of creating a defect in the lattice distortion pattern , similarly to what we discussed in section [ instabilityferro - ss ] , which might lead to a lower energy according to what we found there .",
    "we start with the @xmath8 phase with canting angle @xmath176 , and reduce the distortion of one of the distorted sites to @xmath155 instead of @xmath153 , so that when @xmath271 , the distortion is completely removed . in fig .",
    "[ energyinhomogeneous - f ] , we show the total energy @xmath164 ( where @xmath159 is the energy of the homogeneous phase , corresponding to @xmath272 ) as function of @xmath156 for different canting angles near the transition .",
    "clearly , there is a minimum at @xmath271 ( @xmath273 at @xmath270 ) that corresponds to an excitation where we remove a distortion and create a particle - hole excitation .",
    "this minimum becomes soft at @xmath274 , thus signalling the onset of a transition to a phase where such defects are energetically favourable .",
    "note that this phase can not correspond to the undistorted phase ( i.e. , to removing the distortions on all the sites ) because the undistorted canted phase is higher in energy as is clear from fig .",
    "[ magnetizationgapg6-f ] ( short - dashed lines ) .    to sum up the discussion above ,",
    "when a magnetic - field is switched on , the core spins ca nt towards the direction of the field .",
    "a band opens out of the zero - energy states of the corner sites of the ce phase and the gap gets reduced . at a threshold value of the magnetic - field , there is an instability toward transferring electrons from the localised states ( or lower energy band ) to the mobile states . for field values close to this threshold ,",
    "further energy gain is possible when some jahn - teller distortions are removed and defects are created . when the density increases , the missing distortions start to play a more important role and the one - defect approach we have developed here breaks down .",
    "this scenario for the magnetic - field induced metallic phase is very close to the description of the metallic phase in the ( @xmath177 ) regime as discussed in ref .",
    "clearly , for all the values of @xmath80 we have considered , there are rich transitions from the ce phase to the ferromagnetic phases as a function of the magnetic - field .",
    "the lattice distortions play a crucial role in converting a transition that would be naturally second - order because of the progressive canting of the spins into a first - order transition .",
    "the strength of the magnetic - field at which the transition occurs , although much reduced compared to naive estimates as discussed above , is still much too large compared to experiment , especially if we consider large values of @xmath80 .",
    "however , the large distortions observed experimentally are consistent with relatively large values of @xmath80 .",
    "how does one reconcile these two ? as we have seen , a crucial ingredient that determines the strength of the transition field is the charge gap .",
    "we can reasonably argue that the gap is overestimated in the present approach . on the experimental side ,",
    "the gap is not of the order of @xmath90 but much smaller , typically 5 times smaller for nd@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2.@xcite this is also clear from the temperature at which the charge - order transition takes place .",
    "if we use the estimates of the gap from experiments in the expression ( [ critical ] ) , the transition field comes out to be much smaller , of order 30 t , much closer to the transition fields of that compound .",
    "it is clearly important , therefore , to improve the theory presented above to generate a more accurate estimate for the charge gap in the ce phase . for this",
    "we need to include at least three sources of correction to the gap estimate above . namely the finiteness of the hund s coupling @xmath35 , the cooperative nature of the jt distortions , and small second neighbour hoppings .",
    "when @xmath35 is finite , the electrons can hop even between sites which have anti - aligned core spins .",
    "this opens a band out of the zero energy states and reduces the gap .",
    "second , because distortions of neighbouring sites are coupled , a distortion on a site imposes a distortion on the neighbouring site that lowers the energy level , thereby reducing the gap .",
    "finally , second neighbour hopping allows the corner site electrons to become mobile ( even in the case of infinite @xmath35 ) , and overall increases the bandwidths of all the bands , hence reducing the charge gap ( see , for example , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "we believe that , while the theory presented above clarifies how the smallness of the transition field arises , a more elaborate theory including these three effects which reduce the gap is required to obtain a precise estimate of the transition field .",
    "in conclusion , we have first confirmed various periodic phases of the phase diagram of half - doped manganites ( fig .",
    "[ pd - f ] ) , by optimising the lattice and magnetic energies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have thus provided explicit calculations for the jahn - teller distortions , charge and orbital order - parameters in the various stable phases by exploring the phase space in an unbiased way , albeit limited by the 8-site unit - cell .",
    "it is interesting to discuss , in the context of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ pd - f ] , the strengths of the couplings of real manganites materials .",
    "obviously , the absence of 3d ferromagnetic phases at half - doping suggests that @xmath36 is substantial in these materials ( @xmath275 ) .",
    "the observation of the a - type phase in pr@xmath4sr@xmath4mno@xmath2 with distortions that favour the @xmath8 orbital,@xcite is only compatible with @xmath276 ( fig .",
    "[ pd - f ] ) , a large value that is generally corroborated by large distortions.@xcite in addition , the fact that many half - doped manganites show a ( ce ) insulator to ( ferro ) metal transition as a function of magnetic - field confirms that @xmath80 can not be much larger ( since for @xmath277 , the ferromagnetic phase is also insulating ) . adopting such values @xmath96 ( or @xmath278 ) , the charge disproportionation in the ce phase is @xmath279 ( fig .",
    "[ chargedisproportionation - f ] ) , which is much smaller than goodenough s ionic picture value of 0.5 .",
    "the inclusion of cooperative jt effects is likely to reduce the charge contrast .",
    "in addition , the specific distribution of the charge contrast amongst the mn and o orbitals depends upon band - structure details which we have not considered in this paper.@xcite    secondly , and more importantly , we have studied the instabilities of these phases with respect to canting of spins _ and _ single site defects in their jt distortion pattern , caused by doping away from @xmath280 or by the application of a magnetic - field . the consideration of canted ce phases allowed us to study how the magnetisation changes with applied field .",
    "we have found that the distortions do not change much in the linear regime of the magnetisation up to a threshold field at which there is an abrupt change .",
    "this seems to be consistent with recent experiments.@xcite a more detailed comparison would be interesting in order to extract the strength of the jt coupling . regarding the effect of the doping , we have found that when electrons are added ( with respect to half - doping , i.e. , for @xmath281 ) the transition from an insulating ce phase with self - trapped carriers to the ferromagnetic metallic phase of the colossal magneto - resistance materials proceeds via a first - order transition to canted states .",
    "in contrast , added holes ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) , do not favour canted states because of a lack of density of states near the top of the valence band .",
    "the holes prefer to be self - trapped , at least above a threshold @xmath80 .",
    "this , we believe , is the underlying cause of why the most manganites tend to remain insulating and favour incommensurate charge order@xcite for @xmath33 , but quickly become metallic for @xmath281 .",
    "this striking particle - hole asymmetry has been recently explored within a ginzburg - landau framework@xcite ; we believe that our work clarifies the microscopic basis for this asymmetry.@xcite    we emphasise that the actual numbers we have obtained , such as the threshold @xmath80 and magnetic - field values for the various transitions may not correspond to experimental data because the model we have studied neglects several important effects such as the cooperative nature of the jt distortions , the finiteness of the hund s coupling , presence of second neighbour hopping , etc .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , for example , the size of the charge gap in the ce phase , which in turn determines the threshold field for its transition to the ferromagnetic metallic phase , will be reduced when these effects are taken into account .",
    "finally , and most importantly , in the intermediate jt coupling regime which we have argued is the most appropriate for manganites , we have shown that there is an instability of the ferromagnetic phase to formation of defects in the jt distortion pattern .",
    "we did this by calculating the energy cost for creating a single site defect in the lattice distortion ; i.e. reducing ( and eventually removing ) the distortion at that site and promoting a quasi - localised electron onto a mobile band .",
    "we have shown that there are parameter regimes where this appears spontaneously .",
    "a proliferation of such defects leads to a scenario for the ferromagnetic metallic state that is completely consistent with , and provides a new justification for , the effective two - fluid ( one light and extended , the other polaronic and localised ) picture proposed recently to explain the insulator - metal transition in the colossal magneto - resistance materials.@xcite    on the basis of this identification we have suggested a new effective hamiltonian given by eq . ( [ effectiveemobile ] ) which goes beyond that of ref .",
    "[ ] in that it allows for possible orbital and charge ordering effects .",
    "we believe that a treatment of this hamiltonian using more sophisticated methods , such as the dynamical mean field theory,@xcite will eventually lead to a more complete theory of the manganites , including orbital and charge ordering effects .",
    "we hope to discuss such work elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , our work suggests that the ferromagnetic metallic phase obtained at large magnetic - fields in half - doped manganites is similar to the ferro - metallic phases found upon hole doping , i.e. , for @xmath177 , except , perhaps for some remanent orbital and charge order .",
    "it is an obvious and interesting question as to whether any vestige of the orbital and charge order present in the ce phase survives metallisation .",
    "if it does , the metallic phase would also be rather anisotropic , with larger mobility along the z - axis of the ce phase .",
    "but irrespective of this , it should have a large fraction of sites which continue to be jt distorted accounting for the majority of the @xmath7 electrons , which remain localised , and only a small number of mobile carriers .",
    "interestingly , this resembles the phenomenological picture of ref . .",
    "our results provide a microscopic justification for this picture and can be further tested experimentally in a variety of other ways , such as measurement of drude weights in optical conductivity , exafs and neutron diffraction experiments , for instance .",
