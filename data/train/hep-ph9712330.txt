    "such a situation is not only favored experimentally @xcite , but also from various theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "for example , the requirement that the running higgs self - coupling , @xmath8 , does not develop a landau pole for renormalization scales @xmath9  gev leads to the triviality bound @xmath10  gev @xcite .",
    "since the top quark , with pole mass @xmath11  gev @xcite , is much heavier than the intermediate bosons , top - quark loop effects tend to be the dominant source of electroweak corrections to the couplings of a light higgs boson .",

    "these bottom - specific corrections will not be considered here .",
    "the study of the extension of the sm by a fourth fermion generation is interesting in its own right .",
    "recently , it was noticed @xcite that arguments favoring the presence of a fourth fermion generation may be adduced on the basis of the democratic mass - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of a fourth fermion generation is also considered in the review of particle physics @xcite , where mass bounds are listed .",

    "it is advantageous to trace such novel fermions via their loop effects in the higgs sector , since these effects are also sensitive to mass - degenerate isodoublets via fermion - mass power corrections .",

    "moreover , the @xmath16 and @xmath18 couplings may serve as devices to detect mass - degenerate isodoublets of ultraheavy fermions @xcite , although power corrections do not occur here at leading order .",
    "by contrast , in the gauge sector , leading power corrections only appear in connection with isospin breaking @xcite .",
    "since , at this point , we only wish to extract the leading heavy - fermion corrections to the higgs - boson couplings , we may work in the framework of a yukawa lagrangian where the heavy fermions only couple to the higgs boson and the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons , a situation which corresponds to the _ gaugeless limit _ of the sm @xcite . in the presence of external gauge bosons ,",
    "these can be considered as background sources . in practice , in the covariant gauges",
    ", it suffices to only consider the diagrams that involve exchanges of scalar bosons .",

    "for instance , this happens in the case of the @xmath16 coupling , where qed ward identities imply that @xmath33-boson loops can not be neglected any more .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that , also in this case , the calculation can be performed in a very compact manner .",
    "moreover , we may also take advantage of a soft - higgs theorem @xcite , extended to higher - orders @xcite , which relates the couplings of the higgs boson to gauge bosons to derivatives of the vacuum - polarization functions of the latter .",

    "this is the only such contribution in the case of the lepton and light - quark yukawa couplings , except for the @xmath5 coupling .",

    "in section  4 , we will turn to the couplings which are not present at tree level , and calculate the two - loop @xmath35 corrections to the loop - induced @xmath16 and @xmath18 couplings .",
    "finally , section  5 is devoted to the numerical discussion of our results .",
    "at leading order in the heavy - fermion masses , i.e.  to @xmath2 at one loop and to @xmath1 at two loops for couplings present at the tree level , one can isolate an ultraviolet - finite and gauge - invariant contribution to the higgs - boson production and decay amplitudes which is universal in the sense that it is independent of the initial and final states . as for the yukawa couplings of the leptons and light quarks , except for the bottom quark ,",

    "<S> the dominant electroweak corrections to the production cross sections and partial decay widths of a light standard - model higgs boson , with mass @xmath0 , are due to top - quark loops . by means of a low - energy theorem , we study at the two - loop level the leading shifts in the higgs - boson couplings to pairs of light fermions and gauge bosons induced by a sequential isodoublet of high - mass fermions . for tree - level and loop - induced higgs - boson couplings , these corrections are of relative orders @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where @xmath3 represents a generic heavy - fermion mass , with @xmath4 . except for the @xmath5 coupling , </S>",
    "<S> all results carry over to the case of the top - quark - induced corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible phenomenological consequences of our results .    </S>",
