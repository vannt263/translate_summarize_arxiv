    "the year 2012 was predicted to be the year of the higgs boson .",
    "indeed , its recent discovery at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) marks an important step towards understanding electroweak symmetry breaking  and the manifestation of the hierarchy problem . to date",
    ", it remains unclear how the electroweak scale is stabilized against large corrections from physics at higher scales . to solve this puzzle , it will be crucial to clarify whether there are new dynamics not far above the electroweak scale that trigger the higgs mechanism .",
    "the top quark could be a messenger of such new dynamics . due to its large mass ,",
    "the top quark is suspected to take part in electroweak symmetry breaking and/or to interact strongly with new particles .",
    "thus , probing the properties of the top quark and its couplings to the particles of the standard model ( sm ) might deliver insight into physics beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "the experiments at the tevatron and the lhc provide the appropriate environment for top - quark physics . with the data accumulated to date ,",
    "accurate measurements of the cross section of top - quark pair production have been achieved at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energies of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the equally precise sm predictions @xcite .",
    "searches for new resonances in the top - antitop invariant mass spectrum both at the tevatron and the lhc also did not reveal any hints to physics beyond the sm @xcite . the situation is less unambiguous when considering the top - quark charge asymmetry . the tevatron collaborations cdf and d have measured the charge asymmetry in terms of a forward - backward asymmetry @xcite and found it to be larger than its sm prediction @xcite .",
    "measurements of the correlated charge asymmetry at the lhc by the atlas and cms collaborations do not show any deviation from the sm within the ( large ) experimental errors @xcite .",
    "since the charge asymmetry at the lhc is very small , achieving a more precise measurement is a challenging endeavor .",
    "the tevatron thus leaves us with a puzzle in top - quark physics that is difficult to resolve by measuring inclusive observables at the lhc",
    ".    the year 2012 will certainly also be the year of the top quark . at the lhc ,",
    "top - antitop pairs are currently produced in abundance in proton - proton ( @xmath10 ) collisions at a cm energy of @xmath11 . due to the enlarged phase space with respect to the tevatron",
    ", a large fraction of top - antitop pairs are produced in association with one or more hard jets .",
    "the investigation of an additional jet in @xmath12 production is interesting for very different reasons .",
    "firstly , the process @xmath13 is an important background for signatures with jets , leptons and missing transverse energy , for instance in higgs production via vector boson fusion @xcite or in searches for supersymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "secondly , as the fraction of events with hard jets in inclusive @xmath12 production is sizeable , @xmath0 provides a good test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at higher orders .",
    "the hadroproduction of top - quark pairs with a hard jet has been calculated in qcd to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "a first measurement of the @xmath0 production rate with respect to inclusive @xmath12 production by atlas @xcite suggests that nlo corrections to @xmath0 production will soon be tested at the lhc .",
    "the effects of the top - quark decay and of parton showers in @xmath0 have been investigated in @xcite , yielding precise sm observables ready to face the experiment .",
    "thirdly , the hard jet in @xmath0 production can serve to disentangle the properties of new particles that leave signatures in inclusive @xmath12 production . following this line ,",
    "cms has recently performed a search for heavy @xmath14 bosons in @xmath0 observables @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production . in qcd ,",
    "the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 arises already at leading order ( lo ) , contrary to inclusive @xmath12 production , where the asymmetry is a nlo quantity .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath0 production at the tevatron is sizeable because the charge - asymmetric quark - antiquark parton channel dominates the cross section . at the lhc ,",
    "however , the asymmetry is strongly suppressed by the large charge - symmetric background from gluon - gluon ( @xmath15 ) fusion . to increase the asymmetry at the lhc , deliberate cuts on the @xmath0 phase space are necessary .",
    "we will perform a detailed analysis of the jet kinematics at lo and study their impact on the charge asymmetry .",
    "based on the results , we will derive a set of suitable cuts and show that in qcd the charge asymmetry at the lhc can be increased considerably . the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production in qcd",
    "is known to nlo and has been explored previously in terms of the integrated observables at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation of our results to nlo should be straightforward with the nlo amplitudes at hand .    beyond qcd , the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production can be used to discriminate between different new particles that leave signatures in top - quark pair production .",
    "we will discuss in detail the contributions of massive color - octet vector bosons with vector and axial - vector couplings to quarks .",
    "these `` massive gluons '' arise in various extensions of the sm in addition to the massless qcd gluons , and some may provide an explanation of the enhanced forward - backward asymmetry observed in inclusive @xmath12 production .",
    "the dominant contributions of massive gluons to the integrated charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production at the lhc have been discussed before in @xcite .",
    "our analysis will be based on the complete set of massive gluon contributions .",
    "we will optimize the cuts on the charge asymmetry at the lhc that project on the region where the effects of massive gluons are large .",
    "further , we will explore the prospects of using jet kinematics in @xmath0 production to determine the couplings of heavy color octets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : asymmetry - qcd ] is devoted to the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production in qcd .",
    "in section  [ sec : phasespace ] , we introduce a set of phase space variables that will serve to systematically study the kinematics of @xmath0 production . in section  [ sec : qqbttg ] , the charge asymmetry is analyzed at parton level for the process @xmath16 .",
    "we discuss the jet kinematics in the limit of soft and collinear gluon emission and the dependence on the gluon energy .",
    "our findings are then applied in a numerical analysis of the charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production at the tevatron ( section  [ sec : afbtevatron ] ) and at the lhc ( section  [ sec : abclhc ] ) , where we suggest strategic cuts that enlarge the asymmetry .",
    "the effects of detector cuts on the charge asymmetry are analyzed in section  [ sec : jetcuts ] .",

    "the numerical analysis of massive gluons in @xmath0 production is performed in section  [ sec : axicuts ] . in section  [ sec : axicouplings ] , we show how vector and axial - vector couplings can be distinguished by jet kinematics .",

    "the top - quark charge asymmetry provides a test of charge conservation or , in theories with cp symmetry , of parity conservation in top - quark pair production .",
    "the differential charge asymmetry at a fixed point in phase space is defined as the difference between the production rate of a top - antitop pair and the rate when top and antitop are interchanged . for observables at hadron colliders ,",
    "the key quantity is the partonic charge - asymmetric cross section as a function of the top- or antitop - quark scattering angle @xmath17 with respect to the direction of the incident parton @xmath18 in the @xmath12 system , system is the reference frame obtained by a boost of the parton cm frame along the beam axis , where the rapidities of the top and the antitop quark are of equal magnitude , but of opposite sign . ]",
    "@xmath19 the charge - symmetric differential cross section @xmath20 is defined by replacing `` @xmath21 '' with `` @xmath22 '' in ( [ eq : sigmaapartdiff ] ) . after integrating over one hemisphere , production ,",
    "the integration over the four remaining phase space variables is subject to a cut on the transverse momentum of the hard jet , @xmath23 .",
    "] one obtains the total normalized partonic charge asymmetry @xmath24 which depends on the partonic cm energy @xmath25 .",

    "since strong interactions are charge - preserving , a charge asymmetry in qcd arises only if an additional real or virtual gluon is involved in the production process of a @xmath12 pair . in figure",
    "[ fig : asym_qcd ] , we show representative diagrams for contributions to the charge asymmetry from quark - antiquark ( @xmath43 ) and quark - gluon ( @xmath38 ) initial parton states .",
    "the @xmath38 contribution to the charge asymmetries both at the tevatron and at the lhc is suppressed with respect to the dominant @xmath43 channel  @xcite . in inclusive @xmath12 production ,",
    "an asymmetry is generated at nlo by both real and virtual radiative corrections ( cuts marked by dotted and dashed lines ) , whereas in exclusive @xmath0 production only real radiation contributes ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the exclusive channel @xmath0 thereby allows one to disentangle the ( negative ) real and ( positive ) virtual contributions to the inclusive @xmath12 asymmetry by giving separate access to the subset of real contributions . in the following",

    "the charge asymmetry have to be constructed according to the symmetry of the initial state . at the tevatron",
    ", the charge - asymmetric proton - antiproton initial state allows one to directly access the asymmetry @xmath44 by measuring the production rate in terms of top - antitop rapidity difference , @xmath45 the charge asymmetry is thus observed as a top - quark forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath12 frame . at the lhc , one can not probe the charge asymmetry as a forward - backward asymmetry because the proton - proton initial state is charge - symmetric .",
    "the direction of the incident quark ( which sets the reference axis for the @xmath12 asymmetry ) can still be determined by exploiting the quark s boost inside the proton .",
    "a top - quark `` beamward - central '' asymmetry can then be defined in terms of absolute rapidities is to be understood as @xmath46 . ]",
    "@xmath47 this observable , however , is much smaller than the tevatron asymmetry @xmath48 for two reasons : firstly , @xmath49 is defined in the laboratory ( lab ) frame and is therefore diluted by the boost with respect to the @xmath12 frame , resulting in @xmath50 .",
    "secondly and mainly , the charge - symmetric @xmath15 background at the lhc is much larger than at the tevatron , yielding @xmath51 .",
    "the strong suppression of the total charge asymmetry at the lhc can be relaxed by applying suitable cuts on the final - state phase space . in particular , the jet kinematics can be used to enhance the asymmetry in @xmath0 production . in this section ,",
    "we define a set of cuts in terms of phase space variables that allows one to systematically probe the kinematic behavior of the cross section @xmath42 and the charge asymmetries @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the tevatron and the lhc .    the phase space of the partonic process @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of five variables in the @xmath53 cm frame .",
    "we choose these variables to be the jet and top - quark energies , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the jet and top - quark scattering angles with respect to the incident parton @xmath18 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and the azimuthal angle of the top quark , @xmath58 .",
    "hadronic observables depend on two further variables : the boost of the partonic cm frame with respect to the lab frame , @xmath59 , and the squared cm energy of the @xmath60 pair , @xmath32 .",
    "both these variables are fixed by the momentum fractions @xmath61 and @xmath62 carried by the partons inside the colliding hadrons .",
    "the top - quark energy @xmath55 and the scattering angle @xmath57 , as well as their counterparts @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the antitop quark , determine the rapidities in the @xmath53 cm frame , @xmath65 the rapidities that define the charge asymmetries in ( [ eq : acy ] ) and ( [ eq : acabsy ] ) are obtained after boosting @xmath66 and @xmath67 to the lab frame via @xmath68 , with @xmath69 defined in appendix  [ app : phasespace ] . as the charge asymmetry increases with the rapidity difference @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , a lower cut on this quantity helps to enhance @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this cut does not involve the jet kinematics and is thus equally applicable in inclusive @xmath12 and exclusive @xmath0 production .",
    "jet kinematics are parameterized by the jet energy @xmath54 and the scattering angle @xmath56 .",
    "the production cross section @xmath42 is particularly sensitive to both variables , due to the logarithmic enhancement in the region where @xmath72 and/or @xmath73 .",
    "we postpone a detailed discussion of this behavior to section  [ sec : qqbttg ] and limit ourselves here to expressing @xmath54 and @xmath56 in terms of lab - frame quantities that are suitable for experimental cuts . at lo ,",
    "the jet energy @xmath54 is related to the ( frame - independent ) invariant mass @xmath74 of the top - antitop pair via @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the four - momenta of the top and antitop quarks .",
    "a lower cut on @xmath74 implies an upper bound on the jet energy @xmath54 .",
    "the dependence of the asymmetry on @xmath74 is mild in qcd , but becomes important in the search for massive resonances .",
    "we will elaborate on this point in section  [ sec : asymmetry - coloroctets ] .    the jet scattering angle @xmath56 encodes important information about the asymmetry in the collinear limit @xmath73 .",
    "the jet rapidity in the partonic cm frame , @xmath78 , is directly related to the angle @xmath56 . for experimental purposes , it is convenient to express rapidities in the parton frame in terms of rapidity differences that can be measured in the lab frame , the latter being invariant under boosts along the beam axis .",
    "here we exploit the feature that the rapidity of the system of final - state particles in the parton frame vanishes , which at lo implies @xmath79 .",
    "is given as for @xmath80 in appendix  [ app : phasespace ] by interpreting the momenta as given in the parton frame .",
    "] the parton - frame rapidity @xmath78 can then be described conveniently in terms of the lab - frame rapidities @xmath81 and @xmath69 as @xmath82 as we will show in section  [ sec : qqbttg ] , the qcd charge asymmetry is maximal if the jet is emitted perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "a cut on the jet rapidity @xmath78 is therefore suitable to enhance the integrated charge asymmetry in qcd .",
    "the azimuthal angle of the top quark @xmath58 is not observable at hadron colliders because the experimental setup is symmetric under rotations around the beam axis .",
    "what can be observed is the azimuthal correlation between the particles in the final state , for instance the difference between the azimuthal angles of the top quark and the antitop quark , @xmath83 . for fixed transverse momenta @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", this azimuthal difference can be expressed in terms of the jet transverse momentum @xmath86 via @xmath87 the dependence of the charge asymmetry on @xmath23 will be discussed in section  [ sec : jetcuts ] .",
    "azimuthal correlation in terms of @xmath88 will not be a subject of this work .",
    "the boost @xmath89 of the partonic cm frame with respect to the lab frame helps to discriminate between different partonic initial states @xcite .",
    "it is related to the lab - frame rapidity of the @xmath0 system , @xmath69 , via @xmath90 the derivation , as well as an illustration of the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath69 are given in appendix [ app : phasespace ] .",
    "accordingly , a lower cut on @xmath91 selects events with a strong boost @xmath89 along the beam line .",
    "it increases the weight of the partonic states with a boosted valence quark , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath38 , and thereby enhances the charge asymmetry over its @xmath15 background .",
    "this feature is thus of particular importance at the lhc , where the fraction of @xmath15 initial states dominates the @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "+ besides the above - mentioned `` strategic '' cuts , the design of the detector and the methods of jet reconstruction require additional cuts on the jet properties .",
    "if not stated otherwise , we work with the following cuts on the jet rapidity @xmath81 and the transverse momentum @xmath23 . for tevatron observables , we employ @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for the lhc we use @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the rapidity cut prevents the jet from being emitted parallel to the beam axis , enforcing @xmath96 , whereas the transverse momentum cut imposes a minimum jet energy @xmath97 for a given jet direction . for our numerical analysis",
    ", we set the factorization and renormalization scales equal to the top - quark mass @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "since all calculations are done at lo , we use cteq6l1 pdfs @xcite with an input of the strong coupling constant @xmath99 .",
    "the phase - space integration is performed numerically by means of the vegas monte - carlo algorithm implemented in @xcite .",
    "+      before turning to measurable quantities , we discuss in detail the kinematics of the emitted gluon in the partonic process @xmath16 , which yields the dominant contribution to the top - quark charge asymmetry . at the parton level , the features of the cross section and the asymmetry are not diluted by boosts along the beam axis or by the ignorance of the quark direction .",
    "due to the occurrence of singularities in the infrared limit , a good understanding of the kinematics is crucial in the region where the emitted gluon is soft , @xmath72 , or ( anti- ) collinear to the incident quark , @xmath100 .",
    "the infrared behavior of the charge - symmetric and -asymmetric cross section for different partonic initial states is summarized in the table in figure  [ fig : jet_dist_parton ] . in the @xmath43 and @xmath15 channels , the charge - symmetric cross section @xmath101 exhibits both soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the charge - asymmetric cross section @xmath102 , arising from the diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : asym_qcd ] , is finite in the collinear limit @xmath100 .",
    "the differing collinear behavior of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is reflected by the angular distribution of the gluon , @xmath103 which is displayed in figure  [ fig : jet_dist_parton ] for the partonic process @xmath16 .",
    "the symmetric cross section @xmath101 ( dashed line ) is enhanced if the gluon is emitted along the beam line , which is due to the collinear singularity in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "the asymmetric cross section @xmath102 ( solid line ) does not exhibit this collinear enhancement and reaches its maximum if the gluon is emitted perpendicular to the beam line .",
    "since qcd is invariant under cp conjugation , the angular distribution of the emitted parton from the ( cp - symmetric ) @xmath43 and @xmath15 initial states is symmetric under @xmath104 for both @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "a cut on the transverse momentum of the jet , @xmath105 , simultaneously regularizes soft and collinear divergences . in the region of a low transverse momentum ,",
    "qcd predicts a double - logarithmic enhancement of the charge - symmetric total cross section @xmath42 and a single - logarithmic enhancement of the asymmetric cross section @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath106 the interplay of collinear and soft divergences is shown in figure  [ fig : infrared_behavior ] for the parton channel @xmath16 . in this channel , the partonic cross sections @xmath101 and",
    "@xmath102 feature the same infrared behavior as the hadronic quantities @xmath42 and @xmath35 in ( [ eq : sigmadiv ] ) .",
    "we display the partonic charge asymmetry @xmath107 defined in ( [ eq : ac_parton ] ) ( left panel ) and the cross section @xmath101 ( right panel ) as a function of the gluon scattering angle @xmath56 and the gluon energy @xmath54 , the latter being connected to the invariant mass @xmath74 via ( [ eq : mtt ] ) .",
    "the double - logarithmic enhancement of @xmath101 from  ( [ eq : sigmadiv ] ) is visible in the regions where @xmath72 and @xmath100 .",
    "the charge asymmetry @xmath107 shows a mild dependence on @xmath54 or @xmath74 , unless @xmath54 ( @xmath74 ) is very large ( small ) . in the soft - gluon limit , where most of the cm energy @xmath25 is carried by the @xmath12 pair , the logarithmic enhancement of @xmath101 and @xmath102 from ( [ eq : sigmadiv ] )",
    "cancels in the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "the normalized asymmetry is thus largely unaffected by a variation of the gluon energy @xmath54 in the soft region .",
    "the low sensitivity to @xmath54 or @xmath74 translates to the hadronic asymmetries @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as the @xmath0 cross section @xmath42 is dominated by soft jets ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : infrared_behavior ] , right ) . still , a lower cut on @xmath74 increases the asymmetry , as it projects on the region of soft - gluon emission even for larger cm energies , which yields the dominant contribution .",
    "the dependence of the charge asymmetry on @xmath56 , in turn , is strong . due to the collinear enhancement of @xmath101 , but not of @xmath102 ,",
    "the charge asymmetry @xmath108 vanishes in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath107 is reached for @xmath109 due to the synergy of two effects : firstly , @xmath102 is maximal for a gluon emitted perpendicular to the beam axis and secondly , @xmath101 entering the normalization is depleted in the central region ( cf .",

    "a lower cut on the gluon scattering angle @xmath56 , or equivalently on the jet rapidity @xmath78 from ( [ eq : jet_rapidity ] ) for hadronic observables , therefore increases the charge asymmetry .",
    "in addition , it has the beneficial feature of focusing on the collinear - safe region , where the asymmetry is not affected by logarithmic divergences . in the collinear limit @xmath100 , in turn , large logarithms should be resummed in order to make a reliable prediction of the charge asymmetry in this region .",
    "top - quark pair production at the tevatron proceeds mainly through the partonic channel @xmath43 .",
    "this feature is due to the cm energy of @xmath110 , where the @xmath15 channel is suppressed by the pdfs , and to the fact that both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are valence quarks in the initial hadronic state @xmath113 .",

    "this large reduction is of the order of the charge asymmetry in inclusive @xmath12 production , @xmath134 . it does not signal a breakdown of the perturbative framework , but is due to contributions from virtual hard - gluon corrections @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of the tevatron asymmetry on the jet kinematics .",
    "the low @xmath15 background and the equivalence of the charge asymmetry @xmath44 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath48 from ( [ eq : acy ] ) allow us to apply our findings for the partonic channel @xmath16 from section  [ sec : qqbttg ] directly to the hadronic observables .",

    ", however , a measurement of the charge asymmetry and its kinematical features remains an experimental challenge .",

    ", the charge - asymmetric cross section @xmath35 does not exhibit a logarithmic enhancement in the limit @xmath73 and reaches its maximum if the jet is emitted perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "this is also the region where the symmetric cross section @xmath42 , which normalizes the charge asymmetry and does exhibit a collinear divergence , is less affected by resummation effects .",
    "the utility of a selection of central jet emission is thus twofold : it enhances the charge asymmetry @xmath44 and simultaneously yields a collinear - safe observable .",

    "an upper cut on the jet rapidity in the parton frame , @xmath205 , is thus suited to enhance the integrated asymmetry .",

    "lower cuts on those variables can further enhance the asymmetry , at the cost of strongly reducing the cross section @xmath42 . since the phase space of hard jet emission in @xmath12 production at the tevatron is small , the cross section for @xmath0 production amounts only to @xmath206 . from an experimental point of view , the application of cuts that reduce the cross section is therefore not welcome , and the measurement of the total charge asymmetry with the full data set of @xmath207 luminosity is difficult .    at the lhc , the phase space in @xmath12 production and thereby cross section for hard jet emission",
    "is much larger due to the high cm energy . at @xmath11 ,",

    "a lower cut on the correlated lab - frame rapidity @xmath80 , for instance @xmath210 , enhances the charge asymmetry by a factor of three to @xmath211 and simultaneously reduces the cross section to @xmath212 .",
    "the charge asymmetry exhibits a similar sensitivity to jet kinematics for moderate cuts .",
    "the maximal asymmetry is reached in the central jet region , @xmath213 . a third possibility to increase",
    "the charge asymmetry is via a lower cut on the difference of absolute top and antitop rapidities @xmath214 , which defines the lhc observable @xmath49 .",
    "since the cross section of @xmath0 production at the lhc is sizeable and the data sample for lhc8 is expected to reach about @xmath181 in 2012 , the application of cuts is possible and indispensable in order to obtain a measurable charge asymmetry .",
    "we showed that by combining cuts on three suitable variables , for @xmath210 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 the asymmetry can be enhanced to @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "an asymmetry of that size and for a comparable cross section can not be obtained by applying a stronger cut on only one of the variables . however , even for stronger combined cuts the asymmetry at lhc8 hardly exceeds @xmath219 , making its measurement a challenging task .",
    "massive color - octet bosons , in turn , can generate large effects on the charge asymmetry at the lhc . both vector and axial - vector couplings contribute to @xmath49 at tree level .",
    "an asymmetry from massive gluons with vector couplings to quarks arises just as in qcd from the antisymmetric amplitude for the isr - fsr interference of two vector currents . with axial - vector couplings ,",
    "an asymmetry from axigluon - gluon interference can be generated either by the antisymmetric amplitude for isr - isr or fsr - fsr interference or by the antisymmetric color structure in the case of isr - fsr interference .",
    "the different contributions from vector and axial - vector couplings can be disentangled after applying a lower cut on the invariant mass , which projects on the resonance region @xmath220 , where massive gluon effects are maximal .",
    "contributions from axigluons are generically larger than from massive gluons with vector couplings and depend on the respective sign of the couplings to light quarks and top quarks . for @xmath172",

    "the effects are mostly driven by the qcd - massive gluon interference term @xmath158 . at high @xmath74 , the massive - gluon term @xmath162 yields large effects , if both vector and axial - vector couplings ( i.e. chiral couplings ) are present .",

    "the differing collinear behavior of the cross sections allows to distinguish axigluon effects from qcd and other vector contributions .",
    "an axigluon generates a second maximum of @xmath49 in the forward - jet region , in addition to the common maximum for central jets . in order to exploit this information",
    ", however , a dedicated study of the collinear enhancement and a good experimental control of the measurement in the forward region are necessary .    at the full power of the lhc , @xmath227 , the integrated charge asymmetry is smaller than at @xmath11 due to the increased @xmath15 background .",
    "however , since the cross section for @xmath0 production is larger , stronger cuts can be applied .",
    "we found that the resulting charge asymmetry @xmath49 in qcd can be of the same size or larger than at lhc8 for comparable cross sections . for massive gluon searches",

    "lhc14 is therefore not disfavored to explore a charge asymmetry both in qcd and from massive gluons , and might be even more successful than lhc8 in the search for heavy resonances .",
