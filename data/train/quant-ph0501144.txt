    "for freely propagating optical modes , the fourier transform of the derivative of the electric field , @xmath16 , is of the form @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the fourier transform of displacement is tilt .    in the case of a single photon , the position and momentum",
    "are defined by considering the spatial probability density of the photon , given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the normalisation factor .",

    "spatial entanglement can be generated for fields with any arbitrary transverse mode - shape .",

    "the minimum uncertainty states are those which satisfy the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath23 , in the equality .",

    "consequently , we study the possibility of generating spatial entanglement for array detection devices , based on spatial squeezed beams .      spatial squeezing",
    "was first introduced by kolobov @xcite .",
    "the generation of spatial squeezed beams for split and array detectors was experimentally demonstrated by treps _",
    "a one - dimensional spatial squeezed beam has a spatially ordered distribution , where there exists correlation between the photon numbers in both transverse halves of the beam . a displacement signal applied to this beam",
    "can thus be measured to beyond the qnl .",
    "we consider a beam of normalised transverse amplitude function @xmath75 incident on a split detector .",
    "the noise of split detection has been shown to be due to the flipped mode @xcite , given by @xmath76 when the field is centred at the split - detector , such that the mean value of the measurement is zero , the flipped mode is thus orthogonal to the mean field mode . in this instance , modes @xmath77 ( for @xmath78 ) can be derived to complete the modal basis .",

    "[ spentg ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "since split detection is commonly used as a detection device for beam position , one would naturally consider taking the fourier transform of a spatial squeezed beam to obtain the conjugate observable for the beam .",
    "however , we have shown that split detection does not correspond exactly to beam position measurement .",
    "thus the fourier plane of the spatial squeezed beam does not provide the conjugate observable . more practically , the flipped mode is not mode - shape invariant under fourier transformation . in the far - field ,",
    "each odd - ordered mode component of the flipped mode obtains a @xmath81 gouy phase difference , compared to the near - field .",
    "thus the mode - shape in the far - field is no longer a flipped mode .",
    "consequently , far and near - field measurements of a spatial squeezed beam will not give the conjugate observables .",
    "however , we can find the conjugate observables of a spatial squeezed beam by drawing an analogy to standard homodyne detection . in split detection , the equivalent local oscillator mode is the mean field @xmath75 mode .",
    "the mode under interrogation by the split detector is the flipped mode @xmath82 . in the case of homodyne detection ,",
    "the phase of the local oscillator beam is varied to measure the conjugate observables ( i.e. amplitude and phase quadratures ) of the input beam . adapting this concept to the split detector ,",
    "the conjugate observables for the spatial squeezed beam is thus the amplitude and phase quadratures of the flipped mode , while the mode - shape of the flipped mode remains unaltered .",

    "the coherent tem@xmath2 mode component provides a phase reference for the flipped mode , analogous to that of a local oscillator beam in homodyne detection .",
    "thus the phase quadrature of the flipped mode can be accessed by applying a @xmath31 phase shift between the the tem@xmath2 mode and the flipped mode noise component .",
    "experimentally , this is achievable using an optical cavity .",
    "when the cavity is non - resonant for the @xmath75 and @xmath82 modes it will reflect off the two modes , in phase , onto the split detector . this will give a measurement of the amplitude quadrature of the flipped mode .",
    "however , the cavity can be tuned to be partially resonant on the @xmath75 mode while reflecting the flipped mode .",
    "a @xmath31 phase difference can then be introduced between the reflected @xmath75 and @xmath82 modes , giving a measurement of the phase quadrature of the flipped mode .",

    "this is due to the fact that partial power in the tem@xmath2 mode is transmitted by the cavity , when the cavity is partially resonant on the tem@xmath2 mode .",
    "although it is possible to implement a scheme that conserves the total number of photons at detection ( e.g. losslessly separating the mean field and flipped modes and recombining them with a phase difference ) , we would like to emphasise that our scheme is more simple and intuitive , as well as being valid when @xmath39 is large .      in order to generate spatial entanglement for split detection ,",
