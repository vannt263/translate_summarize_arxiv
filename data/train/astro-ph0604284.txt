    "udalski et al . ( 2002 ) discovered very low amplitude transits in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 magnitude star ogle - tr-109 , located in the carina region of the milky way disk , at @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "they monitored 24 transits , measuring an amplitude @xmath1 mag , and a period @xmath2 days .",
    "based on near - infrared photometry and low - dispersion spectroscopy , gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) identify ogle - tr-109 as an early f - type main sequence star located at a distance @xmath11 kpc , with reddening @xmath12 .",
    "this star is intrinsically 2 magnitudes brighter than the sun , with @xmath13 , and also larger , with @xmath14 .",
    "ogle - tr-109 has been target of a few studies due to its remarkable location in the parameter space .",
    "it shows a very small transit amplitude as well as very short orbital period , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "furthermore the spectral type of the primary is the earliest so far reported for ogle transits .",
    "udalski et al . (",
    "2002 ) estimated @xmath15 for ogle - tr-109 , and a lower limit of @xmath16 for its companion , arguing that the small @xmath17 gives a larger probability that this is an extrasolar planet . upon examining in detail a number of ogle candidates , gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and silva & cruz ( 2005 ) also considered the star ogle - tr-109 as a prime planetary candidate .",
    "pont et al . (",
    "2005 ) , however , classified it as an unsolved case , pointing out three possibilities : a blend of an f - type star with a background binary , a true planetary transit , or a false positive transit detection .",
    "they did not detect radial velocity changes at @xmath18 km / s level , corresponding to an upper companion mass limit of @xmath19 .",
    "they argued that the false positive detection is the most likely explanation . in this paper",
    "we discard this possibility , because we detect the individual transits beyond doubt .    estimating the expected binary star ellipsoidal modulations due to tidal effects , drake ( 2003 ) was the first to point out that it would be possible to limit the mass of the secondary using accurate photometry alone , procedure that was further refined by sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we use the absence of modulation to show that ogle - tr-109 ( if it is not a blend ) should have a very low mass companion    section 2 presents the observations and photometry of ogle - tr-109 .",
    "section 3 explores the likelihood of a planetary companion .",
    "section 4 examines the possibility of a blend with an eclipsing binary .",
    "finally , section 5 gives our main conclusions .",
    "moutou et al . ( 2005 ) demonstrated the high quality photometry that can be obtained with the vlt .",
    "they achieved millimagnitude photometry during the transit of ogle - tr-132 , refining its amplitude and the planetary parameters .",
    "we are carrying out a similar program for several recently discovered ogle transit candidates , with ogle - tr-109 being located in one of the four monitored fields .",
    "the photometric observations were taken with vimos at the unit telescope 4 ( ut4 ) of the european southern observatory very large telescope ( eso vlt ) at paranal observatory during the nights of april 9 to 12 , 2005 .",
    "all four nights were clear throughout , with sub - arcsecond seeing during most of the time .",
    "the vimos pixel scale is 0.205 arcsec / pixel , and no images were under - sampled during this run . given the large vimos field of view that consists of four 7@xmath208 arcmin fields covered by the four ccds arranged in a square pattern with a separation gap of 2 arcmin , we monitored a number of ogle transit candidates simultaneously . here",
    "we report on the observations of ogle - tr-109 , the other stars will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "no standard stars were observed , because we will perform difference photometry .",
    "typically 150 points per night were obtained in the field of ogle - tr-109 , resulting in well sampled transits .",
    "the observations lasted for about 9 hours per night , until the field went below 3 air - masses . figures 2 and 3 show examples of our best images taken near the zenith , and worst images taken at very high airmass .",
    "we used the bessell @xmath0 filter of vimos , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the @xmath0-band in order to complement the ogle light curves which are made with the @xmath23-band filter .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work was to discard blends and binary stars present among the transit candidates .",
    "for this , light curves measured in the @xmath0-band can be compared with the ogle light curves in the i - band , and non - planetary eclipses can be discarded when very different amplitudes are measured , for example .",
    "in addition , while the @xmath23-band filter is more efficient for transit searches ( peeper & gaudi 2005 ) , the @xmath0-band shows better the effects of limb darkening during the transit , and is adequate for the modeling of the transit parameters .    in order to reduce the analysis time of the vast dataset acquired with vimos",
    ", we decided to cut postage stamp images around the transit candidates rather than process the whole images .",
    "the future processing of the whole images is nevertheless a gold mine to identify additional transit candidates @xmath242 magnitudes fainter than the ogle search ( fernandez et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we estimate that the whole images contain @xmath25 stars with @xmath26 for which light curves can be obtained with individual photometric errors @xmath27 mag .",
    "the images of ogle - tr-109 analyzed here are 400@xmath20400 pix , or 80 arcsec on a side .",
    "each of these small images contains about 500 stars with @xmath28 that can be used in the difference images , and light curve analysis .",
    "the 7 best seeing images were selected , and a master image was made for each night .",
    "these master images serve as reference for the difference image analysis ( see alard 2000 , alard & lupton 1998 ) .",
    "the photometry of ogle - tr-109 , with mean @xmath7 gives @xmath29 to @xmath30 mag throughout most of the whole run .",
    "figure 5 shows the full light curve for all four nights , including all data points , which are 650 in total .",
    "indicated are the expected mean times of transits as computed by udalski et al .",
    "the large scatter at the end of the nights is due to high airmass , and degraded image quality .",
    "there the fwhm of the psf grows to more than twice its original size of about 3 pixels ( 0.6 arcsec ) .",
    "these regions of the light curve will be excluded from the following discussion , although we note that there is evidence for the transit at the end of night 4 , the scatter is too large to measure its duration or amplitude .",
    "figure 6 shows the light curve along the third night of observations , when the best transit was monitored .",
    "figure 7 shows the phased light curve of the ogle @xmath23-band photometry for comparison .",
    "although not devoid of scatter , there are @xmath31 points in our single transit shown in figure 6 , and the reality of this transit is beyond doubt . for a given photometric precision of a single measurement of @xmath32 and a transit depth @xmath33 , gaudi ( 2005 ) gives the following equation to estimate the signal - to - noise :    @xmath34    for ogle - tr-109 we find the s / n of this transit to be @xmath35 using @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 of the transits during the first and fourth night are poorer ( @xmath39 ) merely due to the larger scatter in the individual photometric points .",
    "the full ogle photometric dataset for ogle - tr-109 , covering now almost 2000 cycles ( 40 individual transits ) make it possible to significantly refine the ephemerides of this system :    @xmath40    then , figures 6 and 7 clearly lead to our first result : that ogle - tr-109 is not a false positive transit detection .",
    "having ruled out that possibility of a false positive , we consider the remaining three possibilities : a low - mass stellar companion , a planetary transit and a blend with an eclipsing binary star .",
    "early f - type main sequence stars are potentially interesting for astrobiology because their habitable zones are much larger than those of later type stars like our sun ( kasting , whitmire & reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately , planets have not been discovered in early type f - stars .",
    "planetary transits are more difficult to find ( and confirm ) in f - type stars than for later type stars , because the transit amplitude decreases with the square of the stellar size . thus , one expects the typical transit of a jovian planet to have amplitudes of the order of @xmath41 , and @xmath42 mags for f , g , and k - type main sequence stars , respectively .",
    "furthermore , f - type stars have fewer and wider lines in the optical region of the spectrum , and are sometimes rotating very fast , which prevents from achieving the very small radial velocity errors necessary for the detection of planets .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that in the extrasolar planet lists there is a lack of f - type stars with respect to g and k - type stars .",
    "there are twenty f - type stars in the extrasolar planets encyclopedia ( schneider 2005 ) , but none earlier than f7v .",
    "nothing is known about the existence of planets in earlier type stars . because they are difficult to find , it is important to discover them . in their favor",
    ", we should mention that usually f - type stars are intrinsically 1 - 2 magnitudes brighter that g and k - type dwarfs , and that their larger size allows a wider range of inclination angles for observable transits .    the transit time measured by udalski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , shown in their fit to the phased light curve , lasts @xmath43 hours , which is at odds with the interpretation of a planet transiting in front of a solar type star(@xmath44 hours for @xmath45 ) .",
    "this long transit time argues for an over sized star , either a subgiant or an earlier type main sequence star .",
    "gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) rules out a subgiant , on the basis of optical and near - infrared photometry and low dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "they favor an early f - type main sequence star with @xmath46 and @xmath47 k. pont et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtain similar parameters , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 k based on their high dispersion , low s / n spectra .",
    "we adopt the means of the extreme values , @xmath50 and @xmath51 k , because they have been independently measured , and there is no reason _ a priori _ to favor one over the other .",
    "this corresponds to an f0v star with mass @xmath52 . note that a star of this type has a radiative envelope , which does not require a synchronized orbit , in spite of the short orbital period , unless the companion turns out to be very massive ( zahn 1977 ) . on the other hand , circularization of the orbit",
    "must have occurred rapidly , so we assume @xmath53 for this system .",
    "using the full transit observed during the third night ( figure 6 ) , we measure @xmath54 hours , which is consistent with @xmath55 for @xmath45 days .",
    "the measured amplitude of the transit was @xmath3 mag .",
    "we used an image of the sun taken at the big bear solar observatory on february 2 , 2005 , as a proxy to treat limb darkening realistically to fit the light curve ( silva & cruz 2005 ) .",
    "given the period and the estimated mass of the host star , we were able to constrain the semi - major axis @xmath56 of the orbit ( @xmath57 - @xmath58 @xmath59 ) .",
    "this short orbit and the star size of @xmath60 also determines that the allowed range of inclination angles is relatively large .",
    "transits would occur for @xmath61 in this system .",
    "in fact , the geometric probability of detecting a transit in a system like this is quite large , @xmath62 .",
    "the inclination of the system is constrained by the duration of the transit .",
    "this inclination can not depart too much from edge - on because the transit is long .",
    "the best fit corresponds to a transiting object with @xmath63 for our adopted stellar size of @xmath64 , and an inclination of @xmath65 deg .",
    "we measured the transit duration from the best fit , from first to fourth contact .",
    "we searched the best fit minimizing chi - square in the parameter space ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) . to calculate the uncertainties",
    ", we fixed the values of two parameters and let the third to vary until the change in chi - square showed a confidence corresponding to 3-sigma .",
    "the fit is shown in figure 8 .",
    "figure 9 shows the orbit of ogle - tr-109 and its transit configuration drawn to scale for different inclination angles : @xmath68 and @xmath69 degrees from top to bottom .",
    "the smaller inclinations are ruled out because the measured transit duration is too long for a grazing eclipse , unless the size of the star is much larger , which appears to be ruled out by the optical - ir photometry and spectroscopy ( gallardo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the amplitude value of @xmath3 mag is smaller than the amplitude measured by udalski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for ogle - tr-109 , @xmath1 mag .",
    "this is at odds with the expectations , because stellar limb darkening curves in the @xmath0-band should be shallower in the edges but about @xmath70 deeper in the central parts ( e.g. claret & hautschildt 2003 ) .",
    "then , we should have obtained @xmath71 mag in the @xmath0-band .",
    "a larger discrepancy is present between the amplitudes of ogle - tr-132 measured by moutou et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath72 , and udalski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , given the different methods and the errors , we ignore these differences , although it would be interesting to explore ( with larger samples of single transits frequently sampled with millimagnitude photometry ) , if these differences are evidences of systematic effects .",
    "in particular , the amplitude measured in the near - infrared would be very useful to test the significance of the differences , even though measuring @xmath74 with millimagnitude precision would be a challenge .    the smaller amplitude compared with ogle results , and the fact that in @xmath0-band the ingress and egress phases in the light curve are not so steep ( figure 6 ) , make our results differ from those obtained by silva & cruz ( 2005 ) for ogle - tr-109 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results obtained from the light curves , giving the period , hjd , transit time , orbital inclination , amplitude , and radius of the companion .",
    "table 2 lists the previous estimates of the size for the ogle - tr-109 companion from the literature , and this work .",
    "no serious disagreement is found among the four existing measurements of @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , all quoted sizes are substellar , consistent with giant planets or brown dwarfs . as for giant planets",
    "is concerned , ogle - tr-109-b does not seem to be over sized .",
    "one would expect that over such close orbit with @xmath77 the planet should be inflated by stellar radiation .",
    "if this is indeed the case , we could be in the presence of a very low mass planet .",
    "the companion orbits at a distance of merely @xmath78 .",
    "then , the planet is orbiting just outside of the stellar roche radius .",
    "this represents even a more extreme case than those discussed by patzold , carona , & rauer ( 2005 ) .",
    "they examined the tidal interaction of close - in ogle planets , concluding that ogle - tr-56-b , for example , would spin - up the stellar rotation and spiral into the star in a short timescale .",
    "it remains to be studied if a similar fate may await ogle - tr-109-b .",
    "the shortest period planets known are ogle - tr-56 , and ogle - tr-113 ( udalski et al .",
    "2002 , konacki et al .",
    "2003 , torres et al .",
    "2004a , bouchy et al .",
    "2004 , konacki et al . 2004 ) . with @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ,",
    "their orbital periods more than double that of ogle - tr-109 .",
    "if this is a planetary transit , it would be the shortest planet known so far , around the hottest star measured .",
    "unfortunately , the star is rapidly rotating , with @xmath81 km / s , which makes the measurement of precise velocities very difficult ( pont et al .",
    "therefore , in this ( and other similar cases that might arise ) , it is rather important to find other means of establishing the presence of a planet that do not require the measurement of @xmath82 by radial velocities .",
    "one such possibility is to place limits to the ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve due to tidal effects , as discussed by drake ( 2003 ) and sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) . a short period massive companion would induce a detectable photometric signature in the light curve of the primary star , with a periodicity of half the orbital period . for ogle - tr-109 sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) measure one of the light curves with least modulations .",
    "no ellipsoidal modulation with @xmath83 is detected in our light curve for ogle - tr-109 larger than @xmath84 mag ( figure 10 ) , supporting their conclusions .",
    "a caveat is that our data are not ideal to measure low amplitude modulations of the light curve , as it is well known that contiguous photometric points could be correlated , the ogle dataset is more useful in this respect .",
    "drake ( 2003 ) modeled the expected amplitudes of the modulation due to ellipsoidal effects for main sequence stars of different spectral types as function of their companion mass . the effect is larger for early type main sequence stars , because their surface gravity is lower than that of a solar - type star , for example .",
    "he considered a single period of 2 days , but the modulation increases with decreasing period as @xmath85 , and one would expect for his models to provide a strong upper limit for the case of ogle - tr-109 with @xmath45 days .",
    "in fact , the effect in the light curve amplitudes for this star should be more than @xmath86 times that shown in figure 1 of drake ( 2003 ) .",
    "for example , an f0v star with a @xmath87 companion would exhibit a modulation with amplitude of @xmath88 if the orbital period is @xmath89 .",
    "for an orbital period of @xmath90 , this amplitude would be about @xmath91 , certainly not observed in the light curve of ogle - tr-109 .",
    "figure 10 shows the phased light curve of ogle - tr-109 for nights 2 , 3 , and 4 , along with the expected modulation corresponding to a companion with @xmath92 ( the brown dwarf limit ) , and @xmath93 ( the radial velocity limit of pont et al .",
    "these modulations , with amplitudes 0.0034 and 0.0023 mag , respectively , are not seen in our light curve ( figure 10 ) , indicating that the companion mass is smaller than these limits .",
    "the ogle light curve provides an even more stringent limit to the mass .",
    "figure 11 shows the full ogle dataset binned in 0.02 phase bins with parts around the transit removed .",
    "typically 3050 observations were included in each bin .",
    "the light curve is folded with the basic period and twice its value ( as if the star was an eclipsing binary with equal depth eclipses )  lower and upper panels , respectively .",
    "the thick line is an ellipsoidal variation of @xmath94 mmag amplitude .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the data do not show such variability even at a much lower level .",
    "a formal fit to the raw data indicates no significant ellipsoidal variation larger than @xmath95 mmag for both periods .",
    "this is in good agreement with the result of sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) : @xmath96  mmag . using the latter amplitude to extrapolate in figure 1 of drake ( 2003 ) for an f - type main sequence star yields an upper limit of @xmath97 for the companion mass .",
    "this rules out a low mass star or brown dwarf , and leaves the possibility of a transiting giant planet .",
    "note that this constraint from the ellipsoidal modulation agrees with the maximum mass limit @xmath98 established for the companion by pont et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using radial velocities .",
    "interestingly , the reflection or heating effect due to the planet might be detectable because of the short orbital axis .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 of sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) measures this effect . in the case of ogle - tr-109 with @xmath100 au ( silva & cruz 2005 ) , the planet with @xmath101 intercepts about 1/1000 of the stellar flux , and one would expect @xmath102 mmag .",
    "this is not very different from @xmath103 mmag measured by sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a blend of an f - type main sequence star with a background binary is difficult to rule out .",
    "mandushev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) clearly show how a very good transit candidate with consistent radial velocities finally was a blended system . in the absence of radial velocities ,",
    "the possibility of a blend with a background eclipsing binary star can be explored by detecting secondary transits , by comparing the amplitudes of the individual transits , and by comparing the amplitudes of a single eclipse measured with two different filters .    alternated",
    "eclipses of different depths ( i.e. presence of primary and secondary eclipses ) , would be evidence of an eclipsing binary with period @xmath104 days .",
    "note that the eclipses in the first and fourth night do not have high enough quality to compare their amplitudes with the transit shown in figure 6 .",
    "however , the ogle data do not indicate different depth of eclipses within photometric errors .",
    "in addition , the best parts of our light curves in nights 1 , 2 and 3 monitor the times when the secondary eclipses are expected to happen . no secondary eclipses are detected in the light curves of night 2 ( with the smallest scatter ) , with amplitudes larger than @xmath105 mag .",
    "no secondary eclipses are apparent in the ogle light curves either",
    ".    in some cases a blend with an eclipsing binary should show the heating effects on the secondary , particularly for short period binaries with @xmath106 days .",
    "however , the reflection effect measured by sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) for ogle - tr-109 is also small , @xmath107 , as mentioned above .    at first sight",
    "one argument in favor of a blend with an eclipsing binary in the background might the difference between the amplitudes measured in the @xmath0 and @xmath23-bands .",
    "udalski et al . (",
    "2002 ) obtained @xmath108 .",
    "due to limb darkening , the total transit amplitude in the @xmath0-band should be about @xmath70 larger than that , or @xmath109 . comparing this value with @xmath3 measured here ,",
    "there is a @xmath110 difference .",
    "this is not significant enough to discard ogle - tr-109 as a blend .    in order to produce the low amplitude transits ,",
    "the f0v star is located in the foreground and dominates the flux , while the blend must be with a background main sequence star eclipsed by a late - type main sequence star or a giant eclipsed by a main - sequence star .",
    "if the blend is with a later type main sequence star ( g or k ) it would produce @xmath111 is larger than @xmath112 ( e.g. drake 2003 ) , contrary to the observations .",
    "the fact that @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath114 would indicate that the binary has a primary star that is fainter and bluer than the f0v star .",
    "this scenario must be seriusly considered , because it has been observed in other transiting candidate , ogle - tr-33 , which is a hierarchical triple system composed of a slightly evolved f6 star and an eclipsing binary with a k7-m0 star orbiting an f4 star ( torres et al .",
    "only precise radial velocities can rule out ( or confirm ) this kind of configuration .",
    "the eclipsed red giant scenario is ruled out because of the same reason of the redder background binary , and because it would be bright enough to see in the spectra of ogle - tr-109 .    an additional piece of evidence against a blend with a redder background binary star is given by gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who do not detect significant near - infrared excess in the @xmath115-band .",
    "they measured @xmath116 , and @xmath12 , adequate for an f0v star in the milky way disk .",
    "another test of binarity or contamination by a background source is to measure the movement of the photocenter during transit with respect to the uneclipsed portions of the light curve .",
    "this method , often useful for microlensing events ( alcock et al .",
    "2003 ) , does not yield anything conclusive in this regard because the ogle - tr-109 transit amplitude is so small .    in order to further explore the blend issue ,",
    "we have acquired ks band images with sofi at the eso new technology telescope in may 2005 .",
    "figure 4 shows the same field of view of figure 2 and 3 in the ks band .",
    "the small circle indicates a very red point source , presumably a late m - type main sequence star that was not present in the v - band images .",
    "this source , however , can not be the source of the tr109 eclipse .",
    "there are no other faint red stars within 1 arcsec that would contaminate the photometry of our main target star .",
    "other sources of variability that may resemble low amplitude transits are star spots .",
    "these should not be constant with time , however , as has been observed with the transits of ogle - tr-109 .",
    "furthermore , star spots should vary with the rotation period of the star , which in this case should be @xmath117 , in contradiction with the observations .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that for this special case , the photometry shows no evidence for a blend of the f - type star with a background redder binary , and provides tight enough constraints to discard a massive companion , so ogle - tr-109-b is most likely a blend between an f - type star and a binary with a bluer primary star or a transiting giant planet .",
    "udalski et al . ( 2002 ) discovered low amplitude transits in the f0 main sequence star ogle - tr-109 , which we observed with vimos at the eso vlt .",
    "the systematic effects dominate over photon noise because ogle - tr-109 is a relatively bright star .",
    "however , we are able to clearly detect the low amplitude transits on this star .",
    "we note that this approach is complementary to the one followed by udalski et al .",
    "they observed 24 transits , but with few points per transit .",
    "here we observe only three transits , but with numerous points during the transit . given the similar results obtained by the two widely different approaches , it is our strongest conclusion that ogle - tr-109 is not a false positive transit detection as argued by pont et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "examining the transit depths and possibility of secondary eclipses , we suggest that the presence of a blend of the f - type star with a redder eclipsing binary is unlikely , but a blend with a binary with a bluer primary star can not be ruled out by now .",
    "drake ( 2003 ) , and sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) showed that it is possible to limit the mass of the secondary using accurate photometry alone . analyzing the limits to the ellipsoidal variability measured by sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) , and the simulations of drake ( 2003 ) ,",
    "we conclude that a low mass stellar companion with @xmath118 is ruled out , in agreement with the radial velocity limit of @xmath119 measured by pont et al .",
    "the precise mass of the planet may remain undecided for quite some time , because the rapid rotation of the primary star precludes the measurement of radial velocities accurate enough to measure the mass of the companion .    finally , we improve upon the parameters of the transit , in particular measuring a transit time , @xmath120 hours , that is in agreement with the orbital and stellar parameters",
    ". we also update the ephemerides and orbital parameters of this interesting system , measuring @xmath2 days , @xmath3 mag , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 deg .",
    "we have identified two posible scenarios for ogle - tr-109 : a f - type main sequence star blended with a binary with a bluer primary star , or a giant planet orbiting with a very short period around a f - type main sequence star .",
