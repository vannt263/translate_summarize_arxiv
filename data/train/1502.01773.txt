    "it is well - known that solutions of uniformly parabolic partial differential equations possess a smoothing property . that is , beginning with initial data which may fail to be even weakly differentiable , the solution becomes extremely smooth , gaining spatial derivatives at any time @xmath0 . though this property is well - established , such a result",
    "is often excluded from many standard texts in pdes @xcite .",
    "of course , these works contain theorems demonstrating the regularity of solutions , but the same degree of regularity is assumed for the initial data . the notable exception is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 10.1 ) in which a gain of regularity theorem is proved , specifically for the heat equation with initial data in @xmath1 using semigroup methods .",
    "even more concentrated works on the subject of parabolic pde @xcite do not contain such results regarding increased regularity of solutions to these equations .    in the current paper",
    ", we will present a few results highlighting the increased regularity that solutions of these equations possess .",
    "in particular , our method of proof is both new and brief , and relies on _ a priori _ estimates .",
    "hence , when traditional tools like semigroup methods or explicit fundamental solutions can not be utilized , the new approach contained within may still be effective .",
    "let @xmath2 be given .",
    "we consider the cauchy problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the diffusion matrix , and @xmath5 , a forcing function , are both given",
    ". equations like ( [ par ] ) arise within countless applications as diffusion is of fundamental importance to physics , chemistry , and biology , especially for problems in thermodynamics , neuroscience , cell biology , and chemical kinetics .",
    "as we are interested in displaying the utility of our method of proof , we wish to keep the framework of the current problem relatively straightforward .",
    "thus , we will assume throughout that the diffusion matrix @xmath6 satisfies the uniform ellipticity condition @xmath7 for some @xmath8 and all @xmath9 .",
    "we note that under suitable conditions on the spatial decay of @xmath10 , our method may also be altered to allow for diffusion coefficients that are not _ uniformly _ elliptic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we will impose different regularity assumptions on @xmath4 and @xmath5 to arrive at different conclusions regarding the regularity of the solution @xmath10 .    throughout the paper",
    "we will only assume that the initial data @xmath11 is square integrable .",
    "hence , even though @xmath12 may fail to possess even a single weak derivative , we will show that @xmath13 gains spatial derivatives in @xmath14 on @xmath15 .",
    "hence , by the sobolev embedding theorem , solutions may be classically differentiable in @xmath16 assuming enough regularity of the coefficients .",
    "in addition , we will show that @xmath10 is continuous in time at any instant after the initial time @xmath17 .",
    "though the setting ( [ par ] ) is fairly introductory and the assumptions on @xmath4 and @xmath5 are somewhat strong , the new method of proof can be adapted to extend the results to problems with time - dependent terms , transport equations , systems of parabolic pdes , different spatial settings such as a bounded domain or manifold , and nonlinear equations , including nonlinear fokker - planck equations and nonlinear transport problems arising in kinetic theory @xcite .    for the proofs",
    ", we will rely on _ a priori _ estimation and the standard galerkin approximation to obtain regularity of the approximating sequence and then pass to the limit in order to obtain increased regularity of the solution .",
