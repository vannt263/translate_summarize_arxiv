    "they also establish that there are large variations in the amplitude of the density spectrum along different lines of sight .",
    "rickett ( 1977 , 1990 ) and @xcite review the observations of diffractive scintillation and their interpretation .",

    "non - diffractive measurements tend to indicate that the kolmogorov spectrum extends to much larger scales . however , we focus primarily on diffractive measurements because they are much more sensitive",
    ".    density fluctuations that obey the kolmogorov scaling occur in homogeneous subsonic _ hydrodynamic _ turbulence .",
    "they are due to the entropy mode , a zero - frequency isobaric mode whose density fluctuations are offset by temperature fluctuations . since subsonic turbulence is nearly incompressible ,",
    "the velocity fluctuations follow kolmogorov s scaling . to a good approximation ,",
    "the entropy mode is passively mixed by the velocity field , so it also conforms to the kolmogorov spectrum .. ] density fluctuations in the earth s atmosphere , which cause stars to twinkle , obey the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "they arise from the passive mixing of the entropy mode .",
    "the electron density spectrum in the interstellar medium can not be explained by hydrodynamic turbulence . because the medium is ionized",
    ", magnetic effects must be accounted for .",
    "this is evident since the lengthscales probed by diffractive scintillations are smaller than the collisional mean free paths of both electrons and protons .",
    "if the magnetic field were negligible , freely streaming plasma would wipe out density fluctuations at diffractive scales . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "electrons and protons are tied to fieldlines at the scale of their gyroradii . for typical interstellar field strengths ,",
    "these gyroradii are smaller than the diffractive scales .",
    "a magnetic field thus impedes the plasma from streaming across fieldlines , and allows the turbulent cascade and the associated density fluctuations to reach very small scales across the fieldlines before dissipating .",
    "therefore , a theory for compressible turbulence in magnetized plasmas is required to explain the observed density spectra .",
    "our objective is to develop this theory .    until now , the only description of density fluctuations in interstellar plasmas was by higdon ( 1984 , 1986 ) .",
    "these papers , while prescient , preceded a theory for _ incompressible _ mhd turbulence , and therefore did not account for the full dynamics of the cascade .",
    "we compare higdon s theory with ours in  [ sec : higdon ] .",
    "our compressible theory extends the theory of incompressible mhd turbulence given by @xcite by including a slightly compressible slow mode and a passive entropy mode .",
    "we also consider kinetic effects : on sufficiently short lengthscales , the mean free paths of the particles are significant , and the equations of compressible mhd must be modified .",
    "this is especially important for damping .    in a future paper ii",
    ", we apply the theory developed here to estimate amplitudes for density fluctuations produced in supernova shocks , hii regions , stellar winds , and thermally unstable regions .",
    "these are then compared to scattering measures observed along different lines of sight .    before considering compressible turbulence ,",
    "we discuss incompressible mhd turbulence , focusing on issues that are important for the compressible case .",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 , 1997 ) propose a picture of the dynamics of incompressible strong mhd turbulence and describe the power spectra of alfvn waves , slow waves , and passive scalars .",
    "we extend their picture to cover additional features such as the parallel cascades of both slow waves and passive scalars . throughout this paper ,",
    "`` parallel '' and `` transverse '' refer to the orientation relative to the `` local mean magnetic field '' , which is the magnetic field averaged over the scale of interest .",

    "we interpret @xmath8 as the elongation along the magnetic field of an `` eddy '' which has a size @xmath6 transverse to the magnetic field ; it is not an independent variable , but is a function of @xmath6 .",
    "deep within the inertial range , where @xmath9 , eddies are highly elongated along the magnetic field : @xmath10 . in the following subsections , we explain the physics underlying the spectrum , and consider some of the implications .",

    "the appendix summarizes the properties of these waves in the more general case of compressible mhd . in incompressible mhd , alfvn waves and slow waves",
    "are usually referred to as shear - alfvn waves and pseudo - alfvn waves , but the former designation is more convenient for making the connection with compressible mhd .",
    "our understanding of the mhd turbulence is based on two facts : ( i ) mhd wave - packets propagate at the alfvn speed either parallel or antiparallel to the local mean magnetic field ; and ( ii ) nonlinear interactions are restricted to collisions between oppositely directed wave - packets .",
    "these facts imply that in encounters between oppositely directed wave - packets , each wave - packet is distorted as it follows field lines perturbed by its collision partner .",
    "a wave - packet cascades when the fieldlines that it is propagating along have spread by a distance comparable to its transverse size .",

    "it is deduced from two scaling arguments : ( i ) kolmogorov s argument that the cascade time @xmath11 leads to an energy cascade rate , @xmath12 , which is independent of lengthscale ; and ( ii ) the `` critical balance '' assertion that the linear wave period which characterizes the alfvn waves in a wave - packet is comparable to the nonlinear cascade time of that wave - packet , i.e. @xmath13 .    before considering slow waves in mhd turbulence ,",
    "we discuss two topics that are governed by the dynamics of alfvn waves only : eddies and passive scalars .      because of their transverse polarization , alfvn waves are responsible for the wandering of magnetic fieldlines .",
    "a snapshot of wandering fieldlines is shown in figure [ fig : fieldlines ] .",
    "each of these fieldlines passes through a localized region of size @xmath6 in one plane transverse to the mean magnetic field .",
    "away from this plane the bundle of fieldlines diverges due to the differential wandering of the individual lines . at a second plane ,",
    "the bundle s cross sectional area has approximately doubled .",
    "critical balance implies that the distance to this second plane is comparable to the parallel wavelength which characterizes the bundle , @xmath8 . as the bundle spreads , other fieldlines , not depicted , enter from its sides . in general , the neighboring fieldlines of any individual field line within a region of transverse size @xmath6 change substantially over a parallel distance of order @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to think of @xmath8 as the parallel size of an `` eddy '' that has transverse size @xmath6 .",
    "two eddies with the same transverse lengthscale that are separated by a parallel distance greater than their @xmath8 incorporate different fieldlines , and hence are statistically independent .",
    "eddies are distinct from wave - packets .",
    "the former are rooted in the fluid whereas the latter propagate up and down magnetic fieldlines at the alfvn speed . aside from their anisotropy ,",
    "eddies in mhd turbulence are similar to those in hydrodynamic turbulence . they are spatially localized structures with characteristic velocity fluctuations and lifetimes .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "velocity difference between two points is determined by the smallest eddy that contains both .",
    "different eddies of a given size are statistically independent . the three - dimensional spectrum for r.m.s . velocity fluctuations across transverse lengthscales @xmath6 and parallel lengthscales @xmath14 is @xmath15 there is negligible additional power within an eddy on parallel lengthscales smaller than @xmath8 , so for @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 , the smallest eddy that contains both @xmath6 and @xmath14 has a transverse lengthscale @xmath19 which satisfies @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity fluctuation of this eddy is obtained by solving this equation for @xmath19 ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : spectrum2 ] ] ) , and inserting this @xmath19 in equation ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) .",
    "contours of the three - dimensional spectrum are plotted in figure [ fig : contours ] .",
    "each contour represents eddies of a characteristic size .",
    "@xcite give the three - dimensional spectrum in fourier - space . since eddies that are separated by more than @xmath8 are statistically independent , the power spectrum at a fixed transverse wavenumber @xmath21 is independent of the parallel wavenumber @xmath22 in the corresponding region of fourier - space , i.e. where @xmath23 .",
    "the turbulent cascade is generally viewed as `` proceeding '' from larger eddies to smaller eddies as this is the direction of energy transfer . however , smaller eddies cascade many times in the time that a large eddy cascades .",
    "this is particularly important in turbulent mixing .",
    "consider the evolution of two fluid elements whose initial separation is larger than the dissipation scale . on cascade timescale @xmath24",
    ", their transverse separation will random walk a distance @xmath6 as the result of the cascade of smaller eddies .",
    "therefore , on a timescale comparable to an eddy s cascade time , the transverse locations of its component fluid elements  whose sizes may be considered to be comparable to the dissipation scale  are completely randomized .",
    "moreover , since mixing at the dissipation scale causes neighbouring fluid elements to be rapidly homogenized , transverse smoothing of the eddy occurs on the timescale that it cascades .",
    "rapid transverse mixing in mhd turbulence is similar to the more familiar isotropic mixing in hydrodynamic turbulence",
    ".      a passive scalar , @xmath25 , satisfies the continuity equation , @xmath26 , and does not affect the fluid s evolution .",
    "it could represent , for example , the concentration of a contaminant .",
    "we consider the spectrum of a passive scalar mixed by the alfvn wave cascade .",
    "these considerations are important for our subsequent investigation of compressible turbulence .",
    "they are also helpful for understanding the slow wave spectrum .",
    "we discuss the passive scalar spectrum both in the inertial range and also below the scale at which the alfvn wave spectrum is cutoff .      as we show in this subsection , the transverse spectrum of the passive scalar in the inertial range is @xmath27 where @xmath6 is the lengthscale transverse to the local mean magnetic field and @xmath28 is the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation in the passive scalar across @xmath6 .",
    "the passive scalar parallel spectrum is the same as the alfvn wave parallel spectrum given in equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) , where @xmath8 is now to be interpreted as the lengthscale parallel to the local mean magnetic field across which the passive scalar fluctuation is @xmath28 .",
    "mixing of the passive scalar is due to alfvn waves .",
    "slow wave mixing is negligible .",
    "this is because transverse velocity gradients are much larger than parallel ones in mhd turbulence .",
    "thus alfvn waves , whose velocity fluctuations are perpendicular to the magnetic field , are much more effective at mixing than slow waves , whose velocity fluctuations are nearly parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the transverse cascade arises from the shuffling of fieldlines as alfvn waves propagate through the fluid .    the transverse spectrum ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : cspectrum1 ] ] ) follows from the kolmogorov - like hypothesis that the cascade rate of the `` energy '' in the scalar field is independent of lengthscale ; i.e. @xmath29 is constant , where @xmath24 is the passive scalar cascade time , which is assumed to be proportional to the cascade time of alfvn waves .",
    "comparing this with the constancy of the kinetic energy cascade rate , @xmath30 , we conclude that @xmath31 , which implies equation ( [ eq : cspectrum1 ] ) .",
    "a similar argument holds for the cascade of a passive scalar in hydrodynamic turbulence ( e.g. , tennekes & lumley 1972 ) .",
    "the parallel cascade of a passive scalar is more subtle .",
    "it might appear that a passive scalar can not cascade along fieldlines since , neglecting dissipation , both the scalar and the magnetic field are frozen to the fluid , and thus the scalar must be frozen to fieldlines .",
    "in that case there certainly could not be a parallel cascade .",
    "if the scalar were injected on large scales , then fluctuations with smaller wavelengths along the magnetic field would not be generated .",
    "however , dissipation can not be neglected .",
    "it is an essential part of mhd turbulence , as it is of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "for example , the description of turbulent mixing in  [ subsec : eddies ] depends crucially upon small scale dissipation .",
    "perhaps the best way to understand the parallel cascade is to consider mixing on the transverse lengthscale @xmath6 within two planes which are perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field , and which are separated by a parallel distance larger than @xmath8 .",
    "velocity fluctuations within the two planes are statistically independent .",
    "this is evident because a bundle of fieldlines can not be localized within a transverse distance @xmath6 over a parallel separation greater than @xmath8 .",
    "even a pair of fluid elements , one in each plane , that are initially on the same fieldline are mixed into two regions with different values of passive scalar concentration .",
    "it follows that the parallel cascade of the passive scalar also obeys equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "a passive scalar cascade may extend below the transverse scale at which the mhd cascade is cut - off . mixing on these scales is driven by fluid motions at @xmath32 which results in a scale - independent mixing time equal to the cascade time at @xmath32 .",
    "this yields @xmath33 a similar argument applies in hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "@xcite call this regime in hydrodynamic turbulence the `` viscous - convective subrange '' .",
    "the slow wave spectrum is the same as that of the alfvn waves .",
    "it is given by equations ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) , with @xmath7 referring to the velocity fluctuations of the slow waves .",
    "this is a consequence of the similar kinematics of slow waves and shear alfvn waves and the fact that both are cascaded by shear alfvn waves .",
    "slow waves obey the same linear wave equation as alfvn waves , and to lowest nonlinear order they travel up and down the local mean magnetic field lines at the alfvn speed just as alfvn waves do . however , the dynamics of the mhd cascade is controlled by the alfvn waves @xcite because their velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field , whereas those of the slow waves are nearly parallel to it . since perpendicular gradients are much larger than parallel ones in the mhd cascade , alfvn waves are much more effective at mixing than are slow waves . hence",
    ", alfvn waves cascade both themselves and slow waves , whereas slow waves cascade neither .",
    "the transverse mixing of the slow waves by alfvn waves is analogous to the mixing of a passive scalar . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : passivescalar ] , a passive scalar assumes the same inertial range spectrum as that of the velocity field which is responsible for its mixing .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) is also applicable to the velocity fluctuations of the slow waves .",
    "similarly , the parallel cascade of slow waves is analogous to the parallel cascade of a passive scalar .",
    "since alfvn waves cascade in the time they move a distance @xmath8 , slow waves separated by this distance are independently mixed .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) also applies to slow waves .",
    "there is , however , a conceptual difference between the parallel cascades of the passive scalar and of the slow mode . in the absence of dissipation",
    "a passive scalar is frozen to fieldlines , whereas slow mode wave - packets travel along them at the alfvn speed .",
    "a passive scalar has a parallel cascade because alfvnic fluctuations are statistically independent within two transverse planes _",
    "frozen in the fluid _ and separated by @xmath8 .",
    "the parallel cascade of slow waves occurs because two transverse planes separated by @xmath8 and _ travelling at the alfvn speed in the same direction _ experience uncorrelated sequences of distortions suffered as a result of interactions with oppositely directed alfvn waves .",
    "nevertheless , these two requirements are both satisfied in the mhd cascade when the transverse planes are separated by a distance greater than @xmath8 , and so the passive scalar and the slow mode have the same parallel spectrum . whereas passive scalar mixing is due to eddies , slow wave mixing may be thought of as due to `` travelling eddies '' , i.e. eddies which travel up and down the magnetic field at the alfvn speed .",
    "numerical simulations offer some support for the above description of incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "those by @xcite support both equations ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) , and those by @xcite support equation ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) .",
    "however , although the simulations of @xcite support equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) , they yield @xmath34 instead of equation ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) .",
    "because the simulations of @xcite are stirred highly anisotropically , whereas those of @xcite and @xcite are stirred isotropically , it is not clear whether these disparate results conflict .",
    "@xcite speculate that the discrepancy between their spectrum and the scaling prediction of @xcite results from intermittency . in any case",
    ", we expect that the physical picture of a critically balanced cascade , which underlies goldreich & sridhar s description of mhd turbulence , remains valid .",
    "even if the spectrum is proportional to @xmath35 , we expect that the results of this investigation  which assumes a spectrum proportional to @xmath36would not be significantly altered .",
    "the simulations of @xcite confirm that a passive scalar has the same transverse spectrum as that of alfvn waves , although both are proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "they also indicate that the parallel cascade of a passive scalar conforms to equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite present results from simulations of the interaction between oppositely directed slow and alfvn waves ; the slow waves cascade whereas the alfvn waves do not .",
    "they also compute the spectrum of slow waves in a simulation of mhd turbulence and find that both its transverse and longitudinal behavior matches that of the alfvn wave spectrum .",
    "scaling arguments do not yield values for the `` kolmogorov constants '' , the order - unity multiplicative constants of the spectrum .",
    "however , they can be obtained from simulations .",
    "we define them such that equation ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) remains valid , i.e. we take @xmath3 to be the separation at which the r.m.s . velocity difference is equal to , or extrapolates to , @xmath4 .",
    "two kolmogorov constants , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are needed in this paper : @xmath39 in these definitions , @xmath6 and @xmath8 are the inverses of the wavenumbers transverse and parallel to the local mean magnetic field , and @xmath24 is the cascade time of waves with transverse wavenumber @xmath40 . from the numerical simulations of @xcite , @xmath41 because these simulations yield a transverse spectrum which is proportional to @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 , the resulting `` kolmogorov constants '' are not truly constant .",
    "our primary concern is interstellar scintillation , which is affected by electron density fluctuations on very small scales , typically @xmath42 cm for diffractive scintillation . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we calculate the spectrum of density fluctuations which results from compressible turbulence in magnetized plasmas with parameters appropriate to the interstellar medium . throughout",
    ", we consider plasmas that have more ions than neutrals , and that have 1 @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ratio of the thermal pressure to the mean magnetic pressure : @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath4 is the alfvn speed , @xmath47 is the thermal pressure , @xmath48 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath49 is the mass density . in  [ sec : betalt1 ] . ]",
    "the incompressible limit corresponds to @xmath50 .    on the lengthscales that we consider , compressible mhd is a good approximation for the dynamics of the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "kinetic effects , where important , may be accounted for by simple modifications to the mhd equations . therefore , we turn our attention to turbulence in compressible mhd .",
    "the turbulent velocity spectrum in compressible mhd is approximately the same as the turbulent velocity spectrum in incompressible mhd , because the alfvn mode remains incompressible in a compressible medium , and the slow mode is only slightly compressible .",
    "thus , the velocity spectrum for both of these modes is given by equations ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "the appendix summarizes the properties of the relevant modes in compressible mhd .",
    "there are two additional modes in compressible mhd which are not present in incompressible mhd .",
    "one of these is the fast mode .",
    "however , as long as @xmath51 a few , the fast mode is essentially a sound wave .",
    "its phase speed is larger than the phase speed of either the alfvn mode or the slow mode , and so the fast mode does not couple to them .",
    "thus , we ignore the fast mode . an analogous approximation is often made in subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence , where sound waves have little influence on the turbulent cascade .    the second mode that is present only in compressible mhd is the entropy mode .",
    "this is a zero - frequency mode with unperturbed pressure , and with density perturbation offset by temperature perturbation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the entropy mode exists when the turbulent motions are adiabatic ; the entropy mode is then the only source of entropy fluctuations . in hydrodynamics ,",
    "simple scaling arguments show that the entropy mode does not affect the dynamics of the fluid ",
    "the fluid obeys the incompressible equations of motion  provided that fluid motions are subsonic and that density fluctuations are smaller than the mean density ; these arguments carry over directly to mhd ( e.g. higdon 1986 , and references therein ) . furthermore , since the entropy of any fluid element is conserved in the inertial range of adiabatic turbulence ,",
    "the mixing of the entropy mode is identical to the mixing of a passive scalar ( see eq . [ [ eq : cspectrum1 ] ] ) , yielding the transverse spectrum @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the r.m.s .",
    "entropy fluctuation across @xmath54 .",
    "the parallel spectrum is given by equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "analogously , in hydrodynamic turbulence the effect of the entropy mode on turbulent motions can often be neglected , and the entropy mode is mixed as a passive scalar @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussion , there are two sources of density fluctuations on small scales : the slow mode and the entropy mode . since the slow mode density perturbation is proportional to its velocity perturbation , and",
    "since the entropy mode density perturbation is proportional to its entropy perturbation , both yield a kolmogorov spectrum of density perturbations : @xmath55    in the remainder of this paper , we investigate the density spectrum in more detail .",
    "we calculate the density spectrum on diffractive lengthscales for given values of the number density , @xmath56 , and outer scale , @xmath57 . typically , in regions of the interstellar medium which are relevant for scintillation , @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "values of @xmath57 are more uncertain , though it is likely that @xmath57 is typically within a few orders of magnitude of 1 pc .",
    "it is also plausible that the value of @xmath57 is related to that of @xmath56 . in paper ii , we discuss in much more detail the values of these parameters in turbulent regions of the ionized interstellar medium , e.g. in supernova shocks , hii regions , and stellar winds .",
    "a naive guess for the resulting density fluctuation at the lengthscale @xmath6 is @xmath60 , which we refer to as the fiducial spectrum .",
    "however , there are a number of physical effects which suppress the small - scale density spectrum in the interstellar medium relative to the fiducial spectrum .    when considering scintillation observations , it is the transverse  not parallel  lengthscale which is relevant .",
    "each line of sight crosses regions with different orientations of the local mean magnetic field .",
    "the observational effects of the parallel lengthscale are washed out if the orientation varies by an angle greater than a tiny ratio : @xmath61 at the diffractive scale .",
    "since the variation in angle due to eddies on scales larger than the diffrative scale is @xmath62 , it increases with scale , so these eddies render the parallel lengthscale unobservable . as a result , we frequently refer to the transverse lengthscale as , simply , the lengthscale .    because of the multitude of special lengthscales involved ,",
    "we organize the discussion by decreasing lengthscale .",
    "we begin at the outer scale , and proceed down to the smallest scales relevant to interstellar scintillation , while considering the effects of the alfvn mode , the slow mode , and the entropy mode simultaneously . since most of the relevant lengthscales in the interstellar medium have a similar dependence on the background density ",
    "they decrease with increasing density  the ordering of lengthscales is fairly universal . the lengthscales which we consider are the outer scale , the mhd scale , the cooling scale , the collisionless scale of the neutrals , the collisionless scale of the ions , and the proton gyro scale .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the most important effects .",
    "table [ tab : lengths ] lists the lengthscales that are used in this paper .",
    "as a model for the excitation of the turbulence , we consider plasma which is stirred on an outer scale @xmath57 with velocity fluctuations that are of order the sound speed : @xmath63 .",
    "the generalization from this case of mach 1 turbulence to subsonic turbulence with arbitrary mach number @xmath64 is trivial : @xmath57 would be interpreted as an effective outer scale at which velocity fluctuations extrapolate to @xmath65 .",
    "however , we focus on the mach 1 case because it is probably the most relevant for interstellar scintillation .    if , initially , the strength of the magnetic field is negligible , then random fieldline stretching amplifies the mean field @xcite .",
    "it is uncertain both how quickly the magnetic field is amplified , and whether its energy density is amplified until it approaches equipartition with the turbulent kinetic energy density .",
    "if it does reach equipartition within a few outer - scale crossing times , then @xmath66 would be appropriate for mach 1 turbulence . recall that @xmath44 is the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure , or equivalently , @xmath67 .",
    "we generally assume that the mean magnetic field can approach equipartition with the gas pressure , so we think of @xmath44 as close to but a little larger than unity , although we leave its exact value unspecified .",
    "provided @xmath44 is larger than unity and @xmath68 on scale @xmath57 , the turbulent kinetic energy dominates the mean magnetic energy on scales just below @xmath57 .",
    "thus the cascade is hydrodynamic on these lengthscales , and the velocity fluctuations are given by kolmogorov s isotropic scaling : @xmath69 .",
    "the kinetic energy density decreases towards smaller scales . at a critical scale  which we denote @xmath3the kinetic energy density is sufficiently small that it is comparable to the mean magnetic energy density : @xmath70 , which implies that @xmath71 below this scale , the turbulent kinetic energy density is smaller than the magnetic energy density , and the theory of compressible mhd turbulence is applicable .",
    "note that the effects of large - scale velocity fields can be neglected when considering fluctuations on smaller scales , because a large - scale velocity field can be eliminated by a galilean transformation .",
    "however , since large - scale magnetic fields can not be transformed away , they affect the dynamics of small - scale eddies .",
    "hydrodynamic turbulent motions on scales slightly larger than @xmath3 have speeds @xmath72 .",
    "thus they couple to , and efficiently excite , alfvn waves and slow waves whose phase velocities @xmath73 are of comparable magnitude . provided @xmath74 and @xmath75 , fast waves , which have @xmath76 , are weakly excited at @xmath3 . in what follows , we neglect fast waves .",
    "alfvn waves excited at @xmath3 cascade to smaller scales , and these cascading alfvn waves in turn cascade slow waves .",
    "the spectra of both of these cascades are given by equations ( [ eq : spectrum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) , so that @xmath77 for both modes , even on scales smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "we have not yet discussed density fluctuations on the scales which have been considered in this section .",
    "it is more convenient to do so in the following section .",
    "on the lengthscales in the interstellar medium that we have considered thus far , the radiative cooling time is shorter than the eddy turnover time .. ] consequently , in photoionized regions , turbulence on these lengthscales is expected to be isothermal ( sridhar 1998 ; goldreich 1998 ; higdon & conley 1998 ) .",

    "however , the fact that they would contribute a density spectrum different from that which is observed suggests that the entropy wave cascade is not more resistant than the alfvn wave cascade to damping by neutrals .",
    "indeed that is the case .",
    "recall that the condition for the truncation of alfvn and slow wave cascades is that each proton collide with at least one neutral atom during one wave period at the neutral damping scale . under this condition",
    ", the neutrals would damp the entropy waves by conducting heat across them .",
    "although regions in which the cascade is damped by neutrals do not contribute small scale density fluctuations , they may still be significant .",
    "observational evidence indicates that there is more power in density fluctuations on large scales , @xmath250 cm , than would be predicted by extrapolating from small scales , @xmath251 cm , with the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a review of the observations .",
    "perhaps this excess arises in regions where the cascade is damped by neutrals .",
    "we complete this section by briefly considering and then rejecting the possibility that a turbulent cascade truncated at the neutral damping scale might be regenerated on a much smaller scale due to stirring by eddies at the damping scale .",
    "although the ratio of the damping rate to the wave frequency decreases below the scale of the neutral mean free path , the absolute damping rate approaches a constant value .",
    "provided the cascade is truncated by neutral damping , this rate is larger than the stirring rate and the cascade can not be regenerated .",
    "if the cascade survives the neutral collisionless scales , then , proceeding to smaller scales , the next scale of importance is the ion collisionless scale .",
    "this scale is set by the mean free path of protons to collide with other protons : @xmath252 at a temperature of 8,000k @xcite . since the electron and proton gyroradii",
    "( see eq . [ [ eq : protongyro ] ] for protons ) are very small compared to the proton mean free path , the electrons and protons are tied to magnetic fieldlines . therefore , when considering the collisionless effects of electrons and protons , the relevant lengthscales are those parallel to the magnetic field",
    ". since turbulent eddies are highly elongated along the magnetic field , their transverse lengthscales are much smaller than their parallel ones ( eq . [ [ eq : spectrum2 ] ] ) .",
    "it is the transverse lengthscale which is relevant when considering observations of the density spectrum , because each line of sight averages over regions with different magnetic field orientations . in this section ,",
    "we show that both the slow mode and the entropy mode are cut off at the lengthscale where the parallel eddy size is comparable to the proton mean free path .",
    "the lengthscale where the density spectrum is _ observed _ to cut off , i.e. the transverse lengthscale , is therefore significantly smaller than the mean free path .    before discussing the damping of the slow mode and the entropy mode , we consider two larger lengthscales , which are set by the effects of the electrons .",
    "although the behaviour of the cascade at these lengthscales is interesting , it is shown to be unimportant for our purposes .    throughout this section ,",
    "we neglect numerical factors of order unity , such as the factors which are associated with kinetic corrections to the fluid equations ( given in braginskii 1965 ) and the kolmogorov constants .",
    "however , we retain the dependences on @xmath44 , which is assumed to satisfy @xmath74 , and on the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass : @xmath253 .",
    "the electrons have the same mean free path as the protons , but they are faster than the protons by the square root of the mass ratio : @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the electron thermal speed and @xmath65 is the sound speed , which is comparable to the proton thermal speed .",
    "because of charge neutrality , the electrons have the same density , both perturbed and unperturbed , as the protons .",
    "viscous damping caused by the electrons may be neglected : since the dynamic viscosity of the electrons is smaller than that of the protons by the square root of their mass ratio , electron viscous damping is always subdominant .",
    "as we now show , electrons are important for conducting heat on parallel lengthscales slightly larger than the proton mean free path . electrons diffuse parallel to the magnetic field across a distance @xmath8 in the time @xmath256 .",
    "this is equal to the cascade time of an eddy with parallel lengthscale @xmath8 , i.e. it is equal to @xmath257 , at the `` electron diffusion scale '' , given by @xmath258 , where @xmath259 in eddies with parallel lengths smaller than this , the electrons diffuse across the parallel lengths of the eddies , thereby conducting heat , and the electrons are isothermal ; in eddies with parallel lengths larger than this , conduction is unimportant .",
    "we must also consider the effect of electron conduction on the protons .",
    "electrons and proton temperatures approach a common value on the timescale that there are @xmath260 collisions per particle .",
    "since electrons are faster , the collision time is set by the electron speed , and the time for electron and proton temperatures to equilibrate is @xmath261 this time is smaller , by a factor @xmath44 , than the cascade time of eddies with parallel size @xmath262 .",
    "thus in eddies of this parallel size , and in those which are slightly smaller , protons are at the same temperature as the electrons . and , since the electrons are isothermal , so are the protons .    as a result of the above considerations ,",
    "when the parallel cascade crosses the electron diffusion scale , the cascade becomes isothermal .",
    "this is similar to the crossing of the cooling scale , discussed in ",
    "[ sec : coolingsmallbeta ] , though backwards , and similar considerations apply .",
    "in particular , the alfvn mode is incompressible , and hence unaffected .",
    "the slow mode is nearly incompressible , and is only slightly affected : it suffers some damping to first order in @xmath104 .",
    "the entropy mode , however , does not exist under isothermal conditions ; as the electron diffusion scale is crossed , entropy waves are converted into slow waves , and the density fluctuations which had been associated with entropy waves now become associated with slow waves .",
    "continuing to slightly smaller scales , the isothermal cascade reaches the `` equilibration scale '' , where the cascade time , @xmath257 , is comparable to the electron - proton equilibration time ( eq . [ [ eq : equil ] ] ) . at this scale , @xmath263 , where @xmath264 on larger scales , the protons are thermally coupled to the electrons , and hence they are isothermal on slightly larger scales ; on smaller scales , the protons are thermally independent of the electrons , and hence adiabatic .",
    "the transition through the equilibration scale is nearly identical to the transition through the cooling scale (  [ sec : coolingsmallbeta ] ) : the alfvn waves are unaffected , and they mix larger - scale isothermal slow waves into smaller - scale adiabatic slow waves and into smaller - scale entropy waves , although with some damping . therefore , below the equilibration scale , the entropy mode reappears .",
    "the result of the calculations in both this subsection and the previous subsection is that , in crossing the electron diffusion scale and the equilibration scale , density fluctuations which were associated with the entropy mode on large scales are transferred from the entropy mode to the slow mode and then back to the entropy mode .",
    "density fluctuations which were associated with the slow mode on large scales are unaffected .",
    "therefore , for our purposes , these two lengthscales have little net effect on the density spectrum .",
    "although there is some damping , the amount of damping is comparable to the amount at the cooling scale , and hence is not very significant .",
    "entropy waves and slow waves with parallel wavelengths smaller than the proton mean free path both damp on the timescale that protons stream across their parallel wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , because we consider @xmath74 , there is a scale slightly larger than the proton mean free path at which these waves damp in the turbulent cascade .",
    "this is the proton diffusion scale , which is the scale at which protons can diffuse across an eddy within a cascade time . below the proton diffusion scale ,",
    "proton viscosity kills the slow waves and proton heat conduction kills the entropy waves .",
    "alfvn waves are unaffected by either of these effects .",
    "the density spectrum therefore cuts off below the proton diffusion scale .    to evaluate the proton diffusion scale , we equate the time for protons to diffuse across an eddy of parallel lengthscale @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath265 , with the cascade time , @xmath257 .",
    "this gives @xmath266 , where @xmath267 however , from an observational point of view , it is the transverse size of a damped eddy , @xmath6 , which would be observed .",
    "this is related to the parallel size through equation ( [ eq : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we use the kolmogorov constant @xmath268 ( see  [ sec : kolmogorov ] ) .",
    "then , the transverse scale of a damped eddy , i.e. an eddy with parallel size @xmath266 , is @xmath269 which we solve for the cut - off lengthscale : @xmath270 , where @xmath271 below this scale , the density spectrum is cut off . for plausible values of @xmath44 , @xmath57 , and @xmath56 ,",
    "this lengthscale is significantly smaller than @xmath272 .",
    "it is also larger than the proton gyroradius ( eq . [ [ eq : protongyro ] ] , below ) .",
    "@xcite summarize the observations of the density spectrum cut - off .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the cut - off scale is smaller than about @xmath273 cm along many directions .",
    "there is weaker evidence , from refractive scintillation , that along some lines of sight the cut - off scale is larger than around @xmath274 cm .",
    "our theory might have implications for these observations .",
    "we conclude this section with two remarks .",
    "first , we re - emphasize the importance of the fact that the cascade is anisotropic .",
    "it is this fact which allows the density spectrum to reach lengthscales which are significantly smaller than the proton mean free path .",
    "second , we note an important consequence of the parallel cascades of the slow mode and of the passive scalar ; these parallel cascades were explained in great detail when considering incompressible mhd turbulence (  [ sec : incomp ] ) .",
    "had there been no parallel cascade , then neither the slow mode nor the entropy mode would damp at the proton diffusion scale .",
    "the wavelength along the magnetic field would be effectively infinite , and so the ions could not diffuse across wavelengths .",
    "rather , the slow mode and the entropy mode would be mixed down to the proton gyro scale , where the alfvnic cascade is cut off .      on scales smaller than @xmath275 ,",
    "density fluctuations are wiped out . since on these scales protons",
    "diffuse across the lengths of many eddies before the eddies cascade , the density within neighbouring eddies is homogenized .",
    "homogenization occurs not only in the direction parallel to the local mean magnetic field  as might have been expected since protons are tied to fieldlines  but also in the transverse direction .",
    "this is because eddies that are adjacent in the parallel direction incorporate substantially different fieldlines , so proton diffusion also wipes out density differences amongst eddies with transverse separations .",
    "the result is that the density spectrum on scales smaller than @xmath275 is determined by density fluctuations at @xmath275 ; equivalently , @xmath276",
    "the alfvn mode is undamped in a collisionless medium @xcite .",
    "thus , the alfvn wave cascade survives below the proton diffusion scale , without the accompaniment of the slow waves and entropy waves .",
    "the alfvnic cascade is damped at the scale of the proton gyroradius : @xmath277 at this scale , alfvn waves are converted into whistlers .",
    "the whistlers cascade to smaller scales , where they are damped by the collisionless effects of the electrons ( quataert 1998 , viz .",
    "the curve in his fig .",
    "1b that corresponds to equal electron and proton temperatures ) .",
    "the primary goal of this paper has been to calculate the small - scale density spectrum in turbulent interstellar plasmas .",
    "our theory of compressible mhd turbulence is based upon the incompressible theory of @xcite , for which there is growing support from numerical simulations .",
    "we hypothesize that the compressible theory is similar to the incompressible theory of mhd turbulence , but with two main modifications : a compressible slow mode and an entropy mode which is passively advected .",
    "while we believe that this hypothesis is plausible , it can , and should , be tested with numerical simulations of compressible mhd .",
    "because of the multitude of special lengthscales encountered when discussing the turbulent cascade in the interstellar medium , a recapitulation might be useful . in the following",
    ", we list the most important lengthscales , and summarize their significance to the turbulent cascade .    _ the outer scale _ ( @xmath57 ) : this is the lengthscale at which the turbulent motions are stirred . on slightly smaller scales , there is isothermal hydrodynamic turbulence for most plausible astrophysical sources .    _ the mhd scale _ ( @xmath3 ) : at this lengthscale there is a transition from hydrodynamic to mhd turbulence .",
    "larger - scale hydrodynamic motions couple to smaller - scale alfvn waves and slow waves .    _ the cooling scale _ ( @xmath78 ) : at this lengthscale there is a transition from isothermal to adiabatic turbulence . in high-@xmath44 turbulence , where small scale density fluctuations are due to the entropy mode , entropy  and hence density  fluctuations are suppressed by cooling . in low-@xmath44 turbulence ,",
    "i.e. @xmath278 , density fluctuations due to the slow mode are important , and cooling has a negligible effect on the small - scale density spectrum .    _ the collisionless scale of the neutrals _ ( @xmath228 ; @xmath279 ) : neutrals decouple from ions across these scales . if the neutral fraction is not sufficiently small , then all three modes  alfvn , slow , and entropy  are damped .",
    "_ the collisionless scale of the ions _ ( @xmath280 ; @xmath281 ; @xmath282 ) : across these lengthscales there is a gradual transition from fluid behaviour to collisionless plasma behaviour .",
    "the first two of these lengthscales , the electron diffusion scale and the equilibration scale , are set by the electrons .",
    "these lengthscales have only a small net effect on the cascade .",
    "the proton diffusion scale , however , is critically important for density fluctuations : both the slow mode and the entropy mode are cut off at this scale , and hence there are no density fluctuations below @xmath275 .    _ the proton gyro scale _ ( @xmath283 ) : alfvn waves are cut off at this scale . however",
    ", this scale has little importance for the density spectrum , because there are no density fluctuations below the proton diffusion scale .",
    "in his 1984 paper , higdon attributes small - scale density fluctuations to the passive mixing of the entropy mode . in his 1986 paper",
    ", higdon notes that if the entropy mode varies along the magnetic field , it is damped in a collisionless medium .",
    "he then attributes small - scale density fluctuations to the passive mixing of tangential pressure balances .",
    "tangential pressure balances are structures which are parallel to the mean magnetic field .",
    "they are composed of both entropy waves and slow waves that have purely transverse wave vectors .    considering that higdon s papers preceded even a theory of incompressible mhd turbulence , they are a remarkable accomplishment . however",
    ", higdon does not account for the parallel cascade .",
    "entropy and slow waves with purely transverse wave vectors contain negligible power .",
    "they are cascaded along the magnetic field by alfvn waves .",
    "consequently , they are damped when protons can diffuse across eddies in a cascade time , i.e. below the proton diffusion scale .",
    "in this section only , we consider compressible turbulence in plasmas that have @xmath284 , e.g. in isothermal shocks and in the solar wind .    since alfvn waves are unaffected by the value of @xmath44 , and since nearly transverse slow waves are only slightly affected ( see appendix ) , the dynamics of the cascade is nearly independent of @xmath44 .",
    "while the dispersion relation of the slow mode is changed from @xmath285 to @xmath286 , the slow waves are still passively mixed by the alfvn waves .",
    "therefore , the alfvn , slow , and entropy spectra in @xmath284 mhd turbulence are the same as when @xmath74 .",
    "however , the damping of the slow and entropy waves is significantly changed . when @xmath74 , the proton thermal speed is faster than the alfvn speed .",
    "therefore protons can stream across small eddies before they cascade .",
    "conversely , when @xmath284 , the time for protons to cross an eddy is always shorter than the cascade time . therefore slow and entropy waves can not be damped by protons which cross eddies , and the density spectrum extends to smaller scales .",
    "we have ignored the effects of the electrons . however , in the following we show that the electrons behaviour may be ignored for our purposes .",
    "our discussion closely parallels that when @xmath74 in  [ sec : collion ] , and uses similar notation . when @xmath284 , the equilibration scale ( eq . [ [ eq : lequ ] ] ) , is larger than the electron diffusion scale ( eq . [ [ eq : led ] ] ) .",
    "thus the largest scale at which kinetic effects are significant is the scale at which the cascade time is comparable to the time for electrons and protons to equilibrate their temperatures . below this scale ,",
    "electrons and protons are thermally decoupled . nonetheless , this thermal decoupling has no effect on the alfvn , slow , or entropy waves on scales larger than the electron diffusion scale . at the electron diffusion scale ,",
    "the cascade time is comparable to the electron diffusion time .",
    "below this scale , the electrons are isothermal . however , since the protons are thermally decoupled from the electrons , the slow waves and entropy waves are cascaded to smaller scales .    continuing to smaller scales ,",
    "the next scale of importance is that at which the parallel size of an eddy is comparable to the proton mean free path . below this scale ,",
    "the cascade is collisionless .",
    "the alfvn waves are undamped by collisionless effects .",
    "the entropy waves are undamped since protons can not cross eddies within a cascade time .",
    "the slow waves are also undamped within a cascade time : although they damp within a waveperiod by barnes damping , their waveperiod is longer than the cascade time .",
    "consequently , the kolmogorov density spectrum extends down to the proton gyro scale .",
    "in a future paper , we will examine in detail the density spectrum in the solar wind . in another paper ( paper ii )",
    ", we will relate the theory of compressible plasma turbulence developed here to observations  primarily those of diffractive scintillation .",
    "we will demonstrate that the observed amplitude of small - scale density fluctuations is surprisingly large , especially along certain lines of sight , such as the one toward the galactic center . then we will attempt to determine which astrophysical sources contribute the bulk of the density fluctuations and why they do so .",
    "we thank jason maron for analyzing some of his simulations for us , for showing us how to use his numerical code , and for informative discussions .",
    "research reported in this paper was supported by nsf grant 94 - 14232 .",
    "in this appendix we derive the properties of the alfvn mode , the slow mode , and the entropy mode . the fast mode is not relevant to interstellar scintillation for reasons discussed in the body of the paper .",
