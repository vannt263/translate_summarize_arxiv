    "recall that a _ _ @xmath0-adically closed field is a field @xmath1 elementarily equivalent in the language of rings to a _ _ @xmath0-adic field , that is a finite extension of the field @xmath4 of @xmath0-adic numbers . for every @xmath5 in @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the @xmath0-valuation of @xmath5 and its norm .",

    "we let @xmath17 or @xmath18 denote the image of @xmath1 by the valuation .    throughout all this paper",
    "we consider a fixed expansion @xmath19 of a @xmath0-adically closed field @xmath1 , that is an @xmath20-structure extending the ring structure of @xmath1 for some language @xmath20 containing the language of rings . except if otherwise specified , when we say that a set or a function is definable we always mean `` definable in @xmath20 with parameters in @xmath1 '' . for sets and functions",
    "definable in the language of rings ( with parameters in @xmath1 as always ) , we use the term `` semi - algebraic '' instead .",
    "wherever it is convenient we will identify subsets of @xmath21 with their inverse image in @xmath22 by the valuation , thus saying for example that the former are definable , semi - algebraic , and so on if the latter are so .",

    "when the distinction between the @xmath20-structure and the ring structure of @xmath1 is clear from the context , @xmath1 itself is called a strongly @xmath0-minimal field .",
    "strong @xmath0-minimality was introduced by haskell and macpherson in @xcite .",
    "since their proofs make extensive use of the model - theoretic compactness theorem , very little is known on @xmath0-minimal fields without the `` strong '' assumption contrary to the situation in @xmath3-minimal expansions of real closed fields , where @xmath3-minimality already implies strong @xmath3-minimality .",
    "they also left open several questions , such as the existence of a cell decomposition .",
    "mourgues proved in @xcite that a cell decomposition similar to the one of denef in @xcite holds for a strongly @xmath0-minimal field @xmath1 if and only if it has _ _ definable skolem functions ( `` definable selection '' in @xcite ) , that is if for every positive integers @xmath24 and every definable subset @xmath25 of @xmath26 the coordinate projection of @xmath25 onto @xmath27 has a definable section",

    "as cluckers noted in @xcite , a preparation theorem for definable functions was lacking in @xcite .",
    "this remark applies as well to @xcite .",
    "cluckers filled this lacuna for the classical analytic structure on @xmath1 ( see below ) , and derived from his preparation theorem several important applications , for parametric integrals and classification of subanalytic sets up to definable bijection .",
    "the former gives the rationality of the poincar series of a restricted analytic function .",
    "it has been generalised recently to strongly @xmath0-minimal fields in @xcite , by means of a slightly different preparation theorem for definable functions .",
    "however this preparation theorem and the cell decomposition that it uses , are weaker than the original ones studied by denef , mourgues and cluckers .",
    "in particular they do not imply the existence of definable skolem functions , and neither the classification of definable sets up to definable bijection .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address some of these questions by introducing another notion of minimality for expansions of @xmath0-adically closed fields , called `` @xmath0-optimality '' ( see definition below ) with the following properties :    1 .",
    "it is _ intrinsic _ ( that is its definition only involves the given structure , not those which are elementarily equivalent to it ) _ natural _ and _ general _ enough to include all the known examples of @xmath0-minimal fields .",
    "nevertheless it implies strong @xmath0-minimality , the existence of definable skolem functions , cell decomposition and ( under a mild assumption which we will discuss in remark  [ re : mild - min - val ] ) cell preparation , so that all the applications of @xcite generalize to this context .",
