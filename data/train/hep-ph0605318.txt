    "the amplitude factorizes into power corrections and a soft and scale dependent distribution amplitude ( da ) which gives direct information on the quark content of the pion at a given scale .",

    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "most calculations dealing with the pion transition form factor and more specifically with the da involve _ quarks as explicit degrees of freedom_. this appears rather natural but the principle of the quark - hadron duality suggests that it should also be possible to make these calculations entirely in terms of the complete set of hadronic states .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath1-limit of qcd  @xcite makes quark - hadron duality manifest at the expense of introducing an infinite number of weakly interacting stable mesons and glueballs .",
    "the large-@xmath1-limit may in fact be regarded as a model - independent formulation of the quark model .",
    "actually , chiral quark models are particular realizations implementing in a rather natural way this large-@xmath1 behavior at the one - quark - loop approximation and several calculations have been made along these lines  @xcite ( for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . despite the subtleties regarding the correct implementation of chiral ward identities  @xcite , chiral quark models by themselves can not be `` better '' than the large-@xmath1 limit , as they form a particular model realization of this limit .",
    "surprisingly , up to now there has been remarkable little information on the quark content of hadrons based solely and directly on the large-@xmath1 limit and the quark - hadron duality ideas , without resorting to specific low - energy quark models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and analyze the pion transition form factor in the original spirit of the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "we impose chiral constraints at low energies and qcd short distance constraints at high energies and extract from there the da in a _ regge model with infinitely many resonances _ where the radial squared mass spectrum is assumed to be linear .",
    "this near - linearity is supported by the experimental analysis of ref .",
    "we do the analysis in the absence of radiative corrections which must be introduced via qcd evolution , hence our calculation corresponds to some reference scale @xmath4 where the radiative qcd corrections are absent .",
    "remarkably , we obtain the same main result as found previously by us in chiral quark models  @xcite , namely , the leading - twist pion da is _ constant at the scale @xmath4_. our calculation provides an explicit example of quark - hadron duality in an exclusive process .    up till now the calculations within the framework of large-@xmath1 regge models have been mainly restricted to two - point functions  @xcite . on the other hand , large-@xmath1-motivated calculations of three - point functions with short distance constraints have been carried out with a _ finite _ number of resonances , which enabled getting model - independent results for vector meson decays  @xcite . in this regard there are large @xmath1 studies of both the pion  @xcite and the proton  @xcite electromagnetic form factors .",
    "it should also be mentioned that , echoing some older ideas of radyushkin  @xcite , the light - cone wave functions have recently been computed within the holographic approach to qcd based on the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite or meromorphization ideas  @xcite . in these works the quark - hadron duality is also exploited .",

    "some technical details of the lo evolution of the non - singlet da are provided in appendix  [ sec : gegen ] .",
    "partonic distribution amplitudes ( das ) are basic properties of bound states of qcd .",
    "they are defined as matrix elements of quark bilinears between the vacuum and the hadronic state in question .",
    "for instance , the twist-2 da of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 \\psi(-z)| \\pi^a(q ) \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & i f_\\pi(q^2 ) q_\\mu   \\int_0 ^ 1   dx e^{i u q\\cdot z } \\varphi^{(2)}(x ) ,   \\label{av } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a coordinate along the light cone , @xmath15 $ ] denotes the gauge link operator , and @xmath16 is the pion decay form factor , with the pion decay constant @xmath17  mev in the chiral limit .",
    "the das have the support @xmath18 $ ] , normalization @xmath19 , and satisfy the crossing relation @xmath20 . obviously the definition ( [ av ] )",
    "requires an identification of quark degrees of freedom and also specification of a renormalization scale and scheme .    on the other hand ,",
    "the pion da is related to the _ pion electromagnetic transition form factor _ in the process @xmath21 , or more generally , to processes with one pion and two ( virtual or real ) photons on external legs .",
    "this is a physical matrix element which does not depend on the renormalization scale and which is more suitable for our purposes . with the outgoing momenta and polarizations of the photons denoted as @xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ", @xmath25 one finds the amplitude @xmath26 where the pion transition form factor @xmath27 depends on the total virtuality , @xmath28 , and the photon asymmetry , @xmath29 , @xmath30 equivalently , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . for large virtualities",
    "one finds the standard twist decomposition of the pion transition form factor @xcite , @xmath33 with @xmath34 }   { \\left[1-u^2 a^2\\right]^2 } , \\label{j4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] involving the subsequent das .",
    "the above results hold modulo the logarithmic corrections incorporated by means of the qcd evolution of the das , @xmath35  @xcite . at infinitely large",
    "momentum one reaches an ultraviolet fixed point behavior , regardless of the value of the da at some finite scale .",
    "it is important to realize that , at least in the perturbative regime , qcd evolution _ requires _",
    "an identification of the powers in a twist expansion and the corresponding coefficients inherit a logarithmic momentum dependence , @xmath36 provided their value is known at some reference scale @xmath4 .",
    "let us recall that power corrections are a high - energy manifestation of low - energy non - perturbative phenomena .    in the large-@xmath1",
    "limit the vacuum sector of qcd becomes a theory of infinitely many non - interacting mesons and glueballs  @xcite , hence hadronic amplitudes may be calculated as tree - level processes , where the propagators are saturated by infinitely many sharp meson ( glueball ) states . in our case the relevant diagram is shown in fig .",

    "thus , for a massless pion we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the current - vector meson couplings and @xmath43 is the coupling of two vector mesons to the pion .",

    "( [ eq : amp ] ) would naively yield pure power corrections , assuming a _ finite _ number of resonances  @xcite .",
    "the situation with infinitely many resonances requires some care , since the coefficients of the twist expansion involve positive powers of the meson masses and require regularization .",
    "we will illustrate below the situation with an explicit model .",
    "another , more subtle , question regards the role of radiative corrections in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "this problem also arises in chiral quark models which are specific model realizations of the large-@xmath1 limit with explicit quark degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we take over the viewpoint adopted in our previous work  @xcite , namely , we consider a situation where all perturbative radiative corrections are switched off .",
    "this corresponds to an identification of the power corrections at a given reference scale @xmath4 .",
    "thus , our calculations in the large-@xmath1 limit determine the _ initial condition _ for the qcd evolution , of the form @xmath47 .",
    "an obvious advantage of such an approach is that _ after _ the evolution the das comply to the known asymptotic qcd behavior .",
    "we discuss this issue in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : evol ] .",
    "now we proceed to the basic analysis of this paper , namely a study of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) at large @xmath28 .",
    "the idea is as follows : we adopt a model for the spectra and couplings , calculate the amplitude , and compare to eq .",

    "we also assume that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 parameters are isospin - independent , _ i.e. _ are the same for the @xmath2- and @xmath3-type mesons .",
    "we investigate possible departures from this assumption later on .",
    "we also take constant , _ _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51-independent _ values @xmath52 as follows from matching of the predictions of the radial regge model for the vector correlator to qcd @xcite .",
    "standard vector - meson dominance yields the relation @xmath53 . the matching yields @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the long - distance string tension .",
    "if we use @xmath56 from the @xmath57 decay  @xcite we get @xmath58 , while the lattice calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite gives a similar order - of - magnitude estimate , @xmath59 .",
    "condition ( [ c2 ] ) originates solely from the asymptotic spectrum and is insensitive to the low - lying states , whose parameters ( mass , couplings ) may depart form the asymptotic values .    using the standard feynman trick we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) in the form @xmath60 \\right \\}^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( a \\longleftrightarrow -a ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the coupling of the pion to the @xmath51 and @xmath62 states belonging to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 regge towers .",
    "this coupling may involve diagonal ( @xmath63 ) and non - diagonal ( @xmath64 ) terms , hence we introduce @xmath65 .",
    "the double sum may then be transformed into @xmath66 where the factor @xmath67 is introduced for the correct counting the the diagonal and non - diagonal terms . on purely physical grounds",
    "we expect that the non - diagonal couplings are suppressed , because in that case the radial wave functions involve different number of nodes and the overlap is reduced .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that @xmath68 is decreasing sufficiently fast with increasing @xmath69 such that eq .",

    "note , however , that in that case we would have different asymptotic density of @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , which is not possible in a theory with strict @xmath103 symmetry . on the other hand , it is possible to split @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in that case still @xmath106 , but higher - twist das become @xmath107-dependent .",
    "we know from experimental data that the @xmath3-@xmath2 mass splitting is tiny , so that dependence should not be strong .",

    "a key ingredient of these calculation was the correct implementation of chiral symmetry through the ward - takahashi identities .",
    "on the other hand , calculations based on nonlocal quark models originally obtained bumped distributions  @xcite , close in shape to the asymptotic forms . later calculations with more careful implementation of pcac resulted in much flatter results  @xcite , with the da remaining non - zero at the end - points @xmath109 .",
    "the trend to a flat distribution can also be seen in transverse lattice calculations at low transverse scales  @xcite .",
    "the present calculation is founded on more general background , using only the facts that at large-@xmath1 we deal with a purely mesonic theory and that the confined meson spectrum may be described by the radial regge model .",
    "another comment refers to the absence of explicit quarks in the present approach .",
    "interestingly , the calculation , although referring to the partonic structure , as seen in eq .  (",
    "[ av ] ) , never explicitly introduces partons of spin 1/2 .",
    "the @xmath107 variable enters from the feynman representation of the product of two vector - meson propagators and is later identified with the bjorken @xmath107 by matching to the qcd expressions ( [ j2],[j4 ] ) .",
    "the identification is unique , since das are universal for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 and are only functions of @xmath107 ( and the model parameters ) .",
    "an important point , not only for our calculation , but for all model calculations , is the question of the energy scale where the obtained predictions for the das hold .",

    "the qcd evolution is crucial , eventually evolving the das into their asymptotic forms , ,  . at",

    "the matching requires that the coupling of the pion to a pair of regge @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , @xmath189 , is constant for highly excited regge states and large momenta . the twist-2 pion distribution amplitude is then found to be constant in the @xmath107-variable , conforming to the earlier predictions made in a class of chiral quark models .",

    "the regge model results is very reasonable predictions for the slope of the pion electromagnetic transition form factor at zero momentum .",
    "the estimates depend weakly on the string tension , and compare quite well to the existent measurements .",
    "finally , we have noted that similarly to the case of chiral quark models , the qcd evolution is necessary in the present regge model to achieve the correct large - momentum behavior of the pion transition form factor .    useful correspondence with anatoly  v.  radyushkin , guy de teramond and stan brodsky is gratefully acknowledged .",
