    "the braneworld models became an active research area in high energy physics in the last years .",
    "the seminal works of randall - sundrum ( rs ) @xcite introduced an infinite extra dimension by means of a warped compactification .",
    "thereafter , several models explored both the field @xcite as cosmological properties @xcite of the rs models . in six dimensions , by assuming a static and axial symmetry for the bulk , the geometry of the brane is similar to cosmic string space - time .",
    "then , these models are called string - like braneworlds @xcite .    even though the string - like models have the advantage of traping free gauge fields @xcite and minimally coupled dirac fermions @xcite , they present some issues about the core of the source .",
    "the gherghetta - shaposhnikov ( gs ) model @xcite , for instance , does not satisfy the metric regularity conditions at the brane nor the dominant energy condition @xcite .",
    "this is due to the metric proposed be only a vacuum solution of the einstein equations .",
    "the gs model can be regarded as an infinitely thin string - like model .    in order to study the source properties and to suppress the anomalies of the string - like models , giovannini _ et al _",
    "proposed a braneworld scenario constructed from an abelian vortex @xcite .",
    "the solution found numerically satisfies all the regularity and energy conditions , but the analytical solution is still lacking @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same solutions leading to gravity localization , also lead to the localization of the gauge zero mode @xcite .",
    "afterward , de carlos - moreno proposed a supersymmetric model without bulk cosmological constant free of regularity problems @xcite , whereas papantonopoulos _",
    "et al _ regularized the conical behavior near the brane by adding a ring - like structure at the brane @xcite .",
    "more recently , silva - almeida proposed a resolution scheme based in an effective conifold transition in the internal space @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the conical singularity at the core of the brane provides a geometrical flow which smoothes the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes for the scalar , gauge and dirac fields @xcite .",
    "an analytical smooth string - like model was proposed and its gravitational kk modes were studied @xcite .",
    "this thick solution extends the gs model being an interior and exterior string - like model .",
    "the near brane corrections to the geometry makes the model satisfy all the regularity and energy conditions @xcite .",
    "since this string - like model is built from a warped product between a @xmath0brane and a particular steady solution of the ricci flow , called hamilton cigar soliton , the scenario is called the string - cigar model @xcite .",
    "the evolution parameter of the ricci flow yields to a varying bulk cosmological constant and changes the ratio among the components of the stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "moreover , the near brane correction provides a potential well around the brane for the gravitational kk modes @xcite .",
    "once defined and studied this smoothed string - like braneworld , it is worth to analyse the behavior of the standard model fields on this scenario . in this article , we study the features of the gauge vector field minimally coupled to this geometry . we show that the radial component has a richer dependence compared with the thin string - like solution presented on ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover , the kk tower has a trapped massless @xmath1wave state shifted from the origin due to the core behavior .",
    "the displacement of the massless mode happens because the brane - core is shifted from the origin , as in the abelian vortex solution for higher winding numbers @xcite . nevertheless , the source and the massless mode approach to the origin as the geometric evolution parameter increases .",
    "the limit of large values of this parameter matches with the thin string results .",
    "the dynamics for the massive modes , presented in a sturm - liouville equation @xcite , is quite complex to be studied analytically .",
    "then , we accomplish a numerical analysis to find the kk spectrum and the respective eingenfunctions .",
    "it turns out that exists a mass gap between the massless and the massive modes for both the thin string - like and string - cigar models .",
    "moreover , the known linearly increasing kk masses are obtained .",
    "the kk eingenfunctions are all smooth near the brane and they recover the usual string - like pattern asymptotically @xcite .",
    "the string - cigar core enhances the amplitude of the kk modes near the brane . performing the analogue schrdinger approach",
    ", it turns out that the geometric flow , provided by a geometric parameter , controls the high of the barrier and the width of the potential well .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the sec .",
    "[ sec - thestringcigarscenario ] , we review the properties of the thin string - like and string - cigar models as well as the changes provided by the ricci flow on the brane core . in the sec .",
    "[ gaugelocalization ] , we investigate the gauge vector massless field and the kk spectrum and study the influence of the geometric flow in this scenario for the @xmath1wave state . further in this section , we analyse the analogue schrdinger potential behavior upon this flow .",
    "moreover , some conclusions and perspectives are outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the construction of the string - cigar model @xcite .",
    "a complete description of the model , as well further details are presented in ref .",
    "firstly , let us define a string - like spacetime .",
    "let @xmath2 a spacetime that can be split as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a @xmath0brane embedded in @xmath2 and @xmath5 is a two dimensional riemannian space .",
    "a string - like static braneworld is a @xmath2 with axial symmetry .",
    "a warped metric ansatz for this axisymmetric spacetime is @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the induced metric brane and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the so - called warp factors . in order to the brane",
    "possess a regular geometry , we assume that the warp functions satisfy the regularity conditions , namely @xcite @xmath10 where the prime @xmath11 denotes the derivative according to @xmath12 variable .",
    "an example of a string - like geometry is the gs model @xcite , where @xmath13 is the two - dimensional disk of radius @xmath14 and the metric is given by the components @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "the constant @xmath17 is related to the bulk cosmological constant @xmath18 by @xcite @xmath19 therefore , the gs model is a @xmath20 space time which geometry is an exterior solution for a thin string - like brane @xcite .    in the gs model ,",
    "the relation between the bulk planck mass @xmath21 and the brane planck mass @xmath22 is given by @xcite @xmath23 then , in order to solve the hierarchy problem , gs model imposes a fine tuning between the bulk cosmological constant and the angular tension @xmath24 , what yields to @xcite @xmath25 the inequality ( [ cosmologicalconstantconstrain ] ) constrains the possible values for the constant @xmath17 . in the rs model the curvature",
    "is set to be small in order to guarantee the model be obtained from the horava - witten model @xcite . for the gs model , @xmath17 can assume any value satisfying the conditions ( [ clambdarelation ] ) and ( [ cosmologicalconstantconstrain ] ) .",
    "despite all these important features , the gs model does not satisfy all the regularity conditions at the origin @xcite . for @xmath26 , instead of a 3-brane we obtain a 4-brane @xcite .",
    "further , although the thin brane be flat , the curvature at the origin is non zero @xcite . besides these geometrical issues , the source also does not satisfy all the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "the drawbacks of the gs model arise because it is only a vacuum exterior solution of the einstein equations @xcite .    in order to solve these problems concerning the thin string - like branes , an interior and exterior solution for a string - like braneworld",
    "was proposed taking the cigar soliton as the transverse space @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the cigar soliton is a solution of the geometrical ricci flow whose equation is given by @xcite @xmath27 the ricci flow ( [ ricciflow ] ) defines a family of geometries evolving under a parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the metric for the cigar soliton can be written as @xcite @xmath29 the evolution parameter @xmath28 may be identified with the warp constant @xmath17 @xcite , so that , choosing the warp metric components @xmath30 and @xmath31 it defines an axisymmetric braneworld called string - cigar model @xcite .    the string - cigar model converges to the gs model far from the origin @xcite .",
    "near the origin , the string - cigar geometry presents a conical behavior and it smoothes out the warp factor . as a result , all the regularity conditions are satisfied and thereby , the string - cigar geometry is a smooth interior and exterior string - like solution @xcite .",
    "the string - cigar model not only smoothes the gs model near the brane but also provides a geometrical flow due to the variation of the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "indeed , the components of the stress - energy tensor evolves under the geometrical flow . for small @xmath17",
    ", the source satisfies the dominant energy condition , whereas for great values @xmath17 , only the weak energy condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "moreover , the width and the position of the brane core also change with the flow .",
    "the source approaches to the origin and becomes narrower as @xmath17 increases .",
    "therefore , high cosmological constant values situate the source around the origin what agrees with the gs model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the string - cigar model also provides a solution for the hierarchy problem .",
    "indeed , the relation between the masses are now given by @xcite @xmath32 therefore , as in the rs model , due to the dominant energy condition and the hierarchy solution , we concern ourselves to the small @xmath17 analysis .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the near brane corrrections shifts the maximum of the energy density from the origin @xcite .",
    "similar results were found by numerical analysis performed by giovannini _",
    "et al _ for higher winding number abelian vortex @xcite .",
    "besides , kehagias argued that this displacement due to the conical behavior could be used to explain the cosmological problem @xcite .",
    "once we presented how the ricci flow changes the properties of the brane core , we proceed to analyse the effects of this geometrical flow upon the abelian vector field .",
    "we begin with a @xmath33 invariant vector field action , namely @xmath34 where @xmath35 . from the action",
    "( [ gaugefieldaction ] ) , the equation of motion is obtained in a straightforward way as @xmath36 let us consider the brane lorentz gauge @xmath37 and a purely radial field configuration , e.g. , @xmath38 , as usual @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath0brane is flat and has an axial symmetry , the radial vector component @xmath39 should not depend on the brane coordinates , i.e. , @xcite @xmath40    using the string - cigar metric and the gauge choice , the equation of motion ( [ gaugefieldmotionequation ] ) takes the form @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43    performing the kaluza - klein decompositions @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 the eq .",
    "( [ motionequation1 ] ) yields to @xmath46 thus , in order to match eq .",
    "( [ motionequation1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ symmetrygaugecondition ] ) , we restrict ourselves to @xmath1waves states , e.g. , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "further , the eq .",
    "( [ motionequation2 ] ) leads to a general solution to @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an simple integration constant @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the function @xmath48 in the eq .",
    "( [ motionequation7 ] ) is a direct extension to that displayed by oda @xcite . finally , using eq .",

    "we now impose the following boundary conditions @xcite @xmath55 which yields the orthogonality relation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 given by @xcite @xmath58    furthermore , it is possible to transform the kk equation ( [ chiequation ] ) into a schrdinger - like equation . consider the change of independent variable @xcite @xmath59 and of dependent variable @xmath60 where @xmath61 , with @xmath62 a constant .",

    "( [ thinzeromodeschrodinger ] ) , we obtain a normalizable massless @xmath78 this kk massless mode is trapped at the brane because of the exponential factor . moreover , the amplitude is bigger for the gauge massless mode than for the gravitons @xcite .    from the general schrdinger equation ( [ schrodigner ] ) for @xmath68 ,",
    "the solution satisfying the orthogonality condition ( [ orthogonalityrelation ] ) is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a normalization constant .",
    "we plot on figure ( [ fig - masslessmode ] ) the massless mode for the string - cigar and for the thin - string scenarios .",
    "these localized modes are responsible for the effective @xmath0brane gauge field .",
    "the gauge massless modes are more concentrated at origin when compared with the graviton massless modes @xcite .",
    "a worthwhile feature is the displacement of the massless mode from the origin in the string - cigar background .",
    "this behavior is also present in the energy density of the model ( see ref .",

    "using the expressions for the metric factors ( [ warpfunction ] ) and ( [ angularmetric ] ) , we obtain the kk equation from eq .",

    "the existence of this kind of mass gap was also found in negative tension braneworlds in five dimensions @xcite .    applying the boundary conditions ( [ boundarycondition ] ) at some cut off point @xmath97 , it is possible to obtain the kk spectrum .",
