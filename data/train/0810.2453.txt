    "the entanglement of multiple qubits is at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information , and thus has been studied extensively in the past few years . for example , entanglement between a superconducting flux qubit and a quantum harmonic oscillator such as a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid )  @xcite or a lc circuit  @xcite were examined , as well as between two qubits @xcite .",
    "entanglement or coupling between two superconducting charge or flux qubits are well studied in theory  @xcite and also observed in experiments  @xcite . using josephson charge qubits coupled by an inductance ,",
    "a scalable quantum computing architecture was proposed  @xcite .",
    "recently , a superconducting quantum device consisting of four coupled flux qubits was achieved experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a key limiting factor for all of these devices is decoherence such as dephasing or energy relaxation , which occurs , e.g. , when the quantum devices couple to environmental degrees of freedom at a finite temperature .",
    "for example , charge qubits are very sensitive to background charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "flux qubits are practically insensitive to background charge fluctuations , but their phase coherence can still be destroyed by a large number of effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , although superconducting qubits with long decoherence times up to the order of @xmath0 are available  @xcite , applications are severely limited by the relaxation time .",
    "zhang et al . proposed a method to protect stationary entanglement in superconducting qubits from the relaxation and dephasing processes @xcite .",
    "they found a maximum stationary concurrence of about @xmath1 and fidelity of @xmath2 .",
    "another issue is the realization of robust quantum operations . to date , operations on sqs are typically based on special - area pulses  @xcite , which require an accurate control of field parameters such as intensity , duration and shape . in a recent experiment , pulse - timing uncertainty limited the achieved fidelity by an error of about @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "similar problems are faced in the preparation of atomic systems , where coherent population transfer schemes have been developed in order to overcome these limitations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to atoms , superconducting qubits have the advantage that the transition frequencies can be changed to a large degree on demand via the bias flux  @xcite , bias charge  @xcite or bias current @xcite . making use of this advantage , very recently , based on the breaking of parity symmetries , a coherent population transfer in superconducting current - biased phase qubit",
    "was demonstrated using so - called stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passages ( scraps )  @xcite .    here , we discuss schemes to create a set of relevant collective states in a system of two inductively coupled flux qubits driven by time - dependent magnetic fluxes ( tdmfs ) , addressing both the questions of robust coherent control and of decoherence .",
    "controlled state transfer is reported using three different techniques : continuous - wave control fields , robust scrap - based state transfer , and special - area pulses .",
    "a dynamic control of the qubit transition frequencies via the external bias flux is applied in order to maximize the fidelity of our target states .",
    "the inevitable decoherence is modelled via an interaction with a reservoir consisting of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators .",
    "our approach has the advantage that the qubits operate around the optimum point , where the energy levels are symmetric as a function of the bias flux .",
    "in addition , flux qubits typically feature longer decoherence times compared to current - biased qubits  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we first demonstrate how continuous - wave driving fields can be used to populate the antisymmetric collective state for a pair of identical qubits , which is usually decoupled from external electromagnetic field and thus hard to populate .",
    "second , we demonstrate efficient population of the collective symmetric state , both directly and via the anti - symmetric state .",
    "finally , we discuss controlled population of the collective excited state and of different bell states composed of the collective ground and excited states using scrap . interestingly , in contrast to atomic systems , the population of the collective excited state from the ground state is possible directly without involving the intermediate symmetric and anti - symmetric states .",

    "we exploit this feature and demonstrate that the antisymmetric state can be populated even for identical flux qubits by first adjusting the bias fluxes such that the qubits become unequal , then preparing the antisymmetric state , and finally switching back to the degenerate case .",

    "it should be noted that this scheme does not rely on a delicate choice and control of parameters , as it is the case , e.g. , for state preparation via special - area pulses .    the limited preparation fidelity and the slow decay of the state is due to the fact that the decoupling of the anti - symmetric state is not perfect . for any realistic system ,",
