    "low - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibit a variety of intriguing and often counter - intuitive properties .",
    "a prominent example of such a material is the spin - peierls ( sp ) system , which consists of an array of one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic spin - chains with s=@xmath5 on a deformable three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice . below the spin - peierls transition temperature , @xmath6 , the spin - chains dimerize and",
    "a gap opens in the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "the discovery of an inorganic sp compound cugeo@xmath2 made possible a systematic study of impurity effects on sp systems .",
    "@xcite despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts devoted to the study of the effects of doping on the magnetic and structural phase transitions in cugeo@xmath2 , controversies still remain on several fronts .",
    "one major unresolved issue is the temperature versus concentration phase diagram for both within - chain and between - chain dopants .",
    "@xcite the phase diagram has shown certain unusual characteristics as revealed by different techniques : on the one hand , the phase behavior is so complex that there are continuing debates about the physics underlying nearly every single part of the phase diagram .",
    "on the other hand , there exists surprising similarities in the phase behavior for different dopants , irrespective of the type and atomic size of the dopant ions , the magnetic moment size , or the doping geometry . in some theoretical models",
    ", there exists a close relation between the spin - peierls transition and the subsequent antiferrromagnetic phase transition which occurs at a lower temperature in samples with a dopant concentration @xmath7 below a critical value @xmath8 .",
    "our own results suggest that the suppression of the spin - peierls phase as a result of doping has no causative correlation with the emergence of the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase except for the fact that the dopants create unpaired cu spins .",
    "the lack of direct correlation is manifested most clearly in a comparative study of magnetic and non - magnetic ion dopings where the high temperature suppression of the sp phase seems to follow a quite universal behavior with different dopants while the low temperature occurrence of the antiferromagnetic phase reflects the different magnetic properties of the individual magnetic ion dopants .",
    "currently , for within - chain doping studies , both magnetic and non - magnetic ions have been utilized , including zn , mg and ni .",
    "@xcite in early work on doped cugeo@xmath2 , zn was by far the most studied dopant .",
    "a rich amount of information has been accumulated with a variety of experimental techniques ; however , it has turned out that cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 is far from being the ideal system , because of concentration gradient effects and difficulties in fixing the exact zn concentration.@xcite despite these complications , we have continued x - ray scattering studies of zn - doped samples in the hope that by directly comparing our experimental results with all extant ones , we can elucidate the underlying physics .",
    "cuge@xmath3si@xmath9o@xmath2 , on the other hand , currently serves as the sole system for studying between - chain doping effects.@xcite accordingly , we have carried out x - ray scattering experiments on cuge@xmath3si@xmath9o@xmath2 in parallel with our zn studies .",
    "finally , mg doping , regarded as the ideal dopant for within - chain dopants , has been studied extensively by us and our results have been published in several previous papers.@xcite in this paper , we will focus on a comprehensive interpretation of the general phenomenonlogy for both within - chain and between - chain dopings .",
    "we also will present in detail a phenomenological model for the overall phase behavior .",
    "studies of the effects of dopants on the spin - peierls transition in cugeo@xmath2 started with the magnetic susceptibility measurements by hase _",
    "_ right after the discovery of cugeo@xmath2 as the first inorganic spin - peierls material.@xcite in that work , hase _ et al .",
    "_ reported a systematic study of the dopant concentration versus temperature phase diagram using zn as the dopant . later , despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts devoted to trying to confirm this phase diagram , more and more controversies seemed to turn up .",
    "@xcite scattering experiments , arguably the most direct experimental technique for studying structural phase transitions , have provided invaluable insights into the phenomenology of doped cugeo@xmath2 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments have been carried out by different groups .",
    "@xcite in particular , martin _",
    "@xcite performed the first comprehensive neutron - scattering study of cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 .",
    "they discovered a temperature - concentration phase diagram in which the spin - peierls phase transition temperature ( @xmath6 ) first decreased linearly with zn concentration and then appeared to show a plateau - like behavior above about 2% zn doping .",
    "the plateau was presumed to persist up to more than 5% zn doping .",
    "nevertheless , significant broadening of the sp superlattice diffraction peaks was observed in a 3.2% zn - doped sample which suggests that the high doping spin - peierls phase may not be a true independent phase .",
    "this phase diagram was clearly in contradiction with the one obtained by hase _",
    "_ through susceptibility measurements.@xcite in the original phase diagram obtained by hase _",
    "_ , there is a linear decrease of @xmath6 upon doping up to 2% zn , which is in agreement with martin _",
    "_ s results .",
    "however , hase _",
    "et al . _ reported the disappearance of the sp transition above 2% zn doping ; this was indicated by the disappearance of the characteristic dip in the magnetic susceptibility curve , which reflects the opening of the sp spin gap and therefore ordinarily signifies the onset of the sp transition .    at first glance ,",
    "the above two phase diagrams seem to be irreconcilable with each other .",
    "however , if one takes a closer look at the experimental specifics , one finds that the discrepancy originates in part from the different approaches of two experimental techniques .",
    "susceptibility measurements , as a macroscopic experimental technique , are primarily sensitive to long range order and less so to local fluctuations .",
    "neutron scattering , on the other hand , given sufficiently coarse resolution and long scan times , can easily reveal the existence of short range fluctuations .",
    "the neutron scattering results reported by martin _",
    "_ strongly suggest that the high doping sp phase is of short range order and hence not easily detected by magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "thus , care must be taken in determining the phase diagram of the high doping phase .",
    "similar ambiguities have been discovered in studies of si - doped samples .",
    "thus , a systematic and detailed study using both susceptibility and scattering techniques should help to resolve some of the extant discrepancies . in this paper",
    ", we report a detailed synchrotron x - ray scattering and magnetic susceptibility study of the spin - peierls transition in both cu@xmath0zn@xmath10geo@xmath2 and cuge@xmath3si@xmath4o@xmath2 .",

    "the general conclusions are applied to our study of cuge@xmath3si@xmath4o@xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the single crystals used in the experiment come from two sources .",
    "the cuge@xmath3si@xmath9o@xmath2 single crystals were grown at the university of tokyo using the traveling solvent floating zone method and preliminary sample characterization and magnetic susceptibility results have been published elsewhere.@xcite the impurity concentration of these samples has been determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy(icp - aes ) , with an accuracy of about 0.1% .",
    "the cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 crystals were grown by the same method at mit .",
    "samples have a typical mosaic spread of less than @xmath11 full - width at half - maximum at major bragg diffraction peaks .",
    "the typical sample size used for both x - ray scattering and magnetic susceptibility measurements was about @xmath12 mm@xmath13 .",
    "we prepared our samples by cutting them from the end of regular growths which have lengths over 5 cm .",
    "this procedure effectively eliminated the gradient induced in crystal growth caused by the different doping levels of the seed crystals .    in order to differentiate the intrinsic physics from extraneous effects caused by simple concentration gradients ,",
    "a detailed and careful characterization of the samples is crucial .",
    "the electron probe microscope analysis ( epma ) method was used to determine the zn doping concentrations .",
    "twenty evenly spaced spots covering the whole sample surface were used in the epma measurements .",
    "the variations of concentrations were recorded as the uncertainties in the sample concentration .",
    "the sample characterization results are summarized in table i. as shown in table i , the actual zn contents are always lower than the nominal ones in the high doping range , which is consistent with previously reported results .",
    "@xcite however , despite the great disparities between these two concentrations , the concentration gradients and fluctuations found over the surfaces remain relatively small and comparable to those in the mg - doped samples .",

    "high - flux synchrotron x - ray radiation enables us to study both the critical fluctuations and the long range order .",
    "our experiments were carried out at mit - ibm beamline x20a at the national synchrotron light source .",
    "the 8.5 kev x - ray beam was focused by a mirror , monochromatized by a pair of ge ( 111 ) crystals , scattered from the sample , and analyzed by a si ( 111 ) analyzer .",
    "carefully cleaved samples were placed inside a be can filled with helium heat - exchange gas and mounted on the cold finger of a closed - cycle refrigerator .",
    "the measurements were carried out in each sample at the ( 1.5 , 1 , 1.5 ) sp dimerization peak position with the ( h k h ) zone in the scattering plane .",
    "the high momentum resolution of the synchrotron x - ray beam enabled us to measure intrinsic correlation lengths as large as 5000  ; any system with a correlation length larger than this was considered to possess long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of the identical samples used in the x - ray experiments has been measured using a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms ) .",
    "the samples were mounted with the @xmath15 axis parallel to the applied magnetic field , and the data were taken in a magnetic field of 500 oe .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for all of the cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 samples .",
    "the overall features are similar to previously reported results , @xcite showing a rapid suppression of the sp phase transition temperature upon doping and the appearance of a low temperature antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase",
    ". for doped samples , the kink anomaly , which is a characteristic of the sp transition , is rounded .",
    "we determine @xmath6 in the susceptibility measurements from the maximum of the derivative of the kink anomaly and the nel temperature , @xmath14 , simply from the low - temperature cusp temperature . for samples with @xmath7=0.0235 , 0.0255 , 0.34 , and 0.38 , a sharp low - temperature cusp which signifies the onset of the af state",
    "is observed . on the other hand",
    ", the susceptibility curve of the @xmath7=0.027 sample shows a broad low temperature peak with two cusp positions possibly corresponding to two nel temperatures .",
    "=    this is reminiscent of similar results obtained for mg - doped samples by masuda and coworkers.@xcite those authors carried out susceptibility measurements on a series of cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 samples , and found a double peak feature in the low temperature susceptibility data , for @xmath7 in the neighborhood of 0.023 . in their study , it was argued that there exists a first order phase transition as a function of @xmath7 , between a dimerized antiferromagnetic phase and a uniform antiferromagnetic phase , so that around the critical concentration @xmath16 , two af transitions appear because of the microscopic phase separation between these two phases .",
    "detailed comparison of the magnetic susceptibilities of zn- and mg- doped samples yield many similarities , as expected . in ref .",
    ", the sample with the highest mg - doping without the broadening feature had a nel transition around 2.9 k and @xmath17 .",
    "the low threshold started with @xmath18 in which there existed a broadened cusp spanning from 3.2 k to 3.9 k. the cusp peaked more to the low temperature side with the weight gradually shifting to the high temperature side as the concentration was increased .",
    "@xcite we note in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] similar behavior in our zn - doped samples , with the @xmath19 zn - doped sample showing a single cusp at 2.9k , while the @xmath20 sample shows a broadened cusp over the temperature range from 3.1 k to 3.8 k. for @xmath7=0.027 , the left side of the cusp is much higher than the right side suggesting that this sample is closer to the lower temperature threshold of the peak broadening phenomenon .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a range of doping concentrations from @xmath7=0.027 to @xmath7=0.034 which could give us a more complete view of the gradual shift of the weights .",
    "the important point is , however , that we have confirmed that the regime where the susceptibility shows significant broadening coincides with the region where , as we shall discuss in the next subsection , the sp phase begins to lose lro while substantial superlattice scattering intensity is nevertheless still observable .",
    "@xcite therefore , the nel transition broadening must somehow be correlated with the loss of lro of the sp phase .",
    "the instrumental resolution function was experimentally measured at the ( 3 , 0 , 0 ) bragg peak , which has a q value close to that of the ( 1.5 , 1 , 1.5 ) dimerization peak .",
    "the determination of the intrinsic line - shape is complicated by the existence of the two - length scale phenomenon as has been discussed in previous work by some of us.@xcite since two superimposed profiles corresponding to two length scales were always present in the critical scattering in the close vicinity of the sp transition for @xmath21 samples , a unique determination of the intrinsic cross - section was difficult .",
    "however , only a single scattering profile was observable in the critical scattering for @xmath22 samples , where dopant effects play a more important role than the near surface dislocation effects which are presumably responsible for the large length scale fluctuations in samples with lro . for typical second order phase transitions ,",
    "the critical scattering cross section assumes a lorentzian lineshape .",
    "any deviation from this line - shape can provide information on the effects of disorder on the underlying phase transition .",
    "=    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the low temperature ( 1.5 , 1 , 1.5 ) superlattice peak profile for the @xmath7=0.038 sample .",
    "it is evident that the resolution function is much narrower than the intrinsic cross section .",
    "both lorentzian and lorentzian squared cross sections have been used to fit the data .",
    "the lorentzian squared lineshape gives a discernably better fit than a simple lorentzian lineshape .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the ( 1.5 , 1 , 1.5 ) dimerization peak intensity for various cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 samples .",
    "we normalize the intensity of each sample data set using the dimerization peak intensity at 5 k. as is obvious in the figure , in sharp contrast to the transition in pure cugeo@xmath2 , the sp transitions for the doped samples are noticeably rounded , and further the rounding increases progressively with increasing dopant concentration .",
    "we believe that this substantial rounding is intrinsic and can not simply be accounted for by local concentration gradients for the following reasons : ( i ) the impurity concentration is too low to create any substantial correlated effect .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) there exists a monotonic increase of the rounding in the order parameter as the doping concentration is increased , while experimentally the measured concentration gradients are of similar magnitude for all of the samples studied .",
    "for example , the @xmath7=0.038 sample has a concentration variance of less than 0.2% , from table i. however , that sample s sp dimerization peak intensity increases sufficiently gradually as the temperature is lowered that it does not achieve saturation for the whole temperature range studied . in sharp contrast , no significant rounding was found in the @xmath7=0.011 sample which has a similar concentration variance .",
    "=    not only does the order parameter temperature dependence change dramatically upon doping , the corresponding saturation correlation length also behaves quite differently from that in the undoped sample .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the temperature dependence of the longitudinal inverse correlation length for the different cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 samples . the minimum inverse correlation length which the sample achieves as a function of @xmath7",
    "is plotted in the inset . unlike the pure material , in which very near @xmath6 the inverse correlation length decreases linearly to zero",
    "as @xmath6 is approached from above because of the second length scale critical fluctuations , the inverse correlation length of the doped samples appears to approach zero in an asymptotic way without a clear signature of the exact temperature at which it becomes zero .",
    "this complication makes an unequivocal determination of @xmath6 difficult . within our experimental accuracy",
    ", samples attain lro ( that is , the correlation length exceeds 5000  ) only for @xmath23 .",
    "substantial intensity is still observable at the superlattice peak positions for the @xmath7=0.034 and @xmath7=0.038 samples which have @xmath24 , although the superlattice peaks are not resolution - limited in width .",
    "the critical dopant concentration , @xmath8 , which we have determined for cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 is slightly higher than that for the cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 samples .",
    "however , this could be due in part to the different techniques used in determining the concentrations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the results from the fits for the peak intensity , which for lro is the order parameter squared , and the inverse correlation length , @xmath25 for samples with @xmath7=0.011 and @xmath7=0.0235 . also plotted is the diffuse scattering intensity at the wing ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) of the dimerization superlattice peak , which is a measure of the amplitude of the critical fluctuations .",
    "the transition is slightly broadened as compared to the sp transition in pure cugeo@xmath2 .",
    "this is reflected both in the smearing of the order parameter onset temperature and the temperature range of the diffuse scattering .",
    "the inverse correlation length follows more or less a linear relationship with temperature . for the samples with @xmath7=0.0235 ,",
    "the broadening in the temperature dependence of both the order parameter and the diffuse scattering has increased significantly .",
    "the corresponding inverse correlation length first exhibits a linear relationship as a function of temperature with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , close to the transition , @xmath28 k , the rate of the divergence slows down and @xmath25 appears to approach zero asymptotically , that is , with zero slope .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the linear behavior is extrapolated to intersect the temperature axis , one obtains a temperature which roughly matches that of the maximum of the diffuse scattering .",
    "=    sp transitions in doped samples have shown unconventional characteristics that are absent in typical second - order phase transitions .",
    "one of these is that when the doped system undergoes a sp transition , the times for the system to reach phase equilibrium are anomalously long . in x - ray scattering experiments ,",
    "this is reflected in a continuous change in the peak intensity and width as a function of time .",
    "this anomaly manifests itself in pronounced thermal hysteresis in the order parameter measurements if the system is not kept sufficiently long at each temperature .",
    "this slow dynamics behavior is not observed in pure cugeo@xmath2 . under the same experimental conditions , upon rapid change of temperature by several degrees",
    ", the pure system achieves equilibrium within minutes , in sharp contrast to the highly doped samples .",
    "we characterized the slow dynamics by monitoring the intensity of the superlattice peak after a sudden change in temperature as a function of time while keeping the final temperature constant .",
    "the time scans for the system in equilibrium show an oscillating behavior with the centerline remaining flat .",
    "the oscillations reflects the temperature fluctuations at the sample place and agree well with the temperature fluctuation patterns recorded from the temperature controller .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows representative time scans for @xmath7=0.0235 for both heating and cooling temperature runs on a semi - logarithmic scale . after the sample",
    "was quenched from 8k to 7k , it was observed that the peak intensity increased monotonically with time and did not saturate after more than half an hour .",
    "there are , in addition , oscillations identical to those observed in the pure sample .",
    "this reveals that the slow dynamics are not caused by poor thermal contacts .",
    "the slow dynamics behavior exists even upon change of temperature by an amount as small as 0.05k as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . the linear relationship in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] suggests that the peak intensities are following time logarithmic behavior .",
    "in addition to the anomalous behavior of the peak intensity , the peak width also changes continuously .",
    "a slow increase of intensity is accompanied by a slow decrease in peak width and _ vice versa_. this means that the time dependence originates in slow growth or contraction of the domains after a sudden change in temperature .    =    to understand the origin of the slow dynamics , we first recall that for sp systems , the phase transition occurs as the neighboring spins pair up and create a local gap in the excitation spectrum , and eventually lro is achieved when the 3d phase coherence of these local dimerizations is established . in pure cugeo@xmath2 , these two events happen at the same temperature . for doped samples , on the other hand",
    ", we observed substantial superlattice intensity even when the system had only sro , which suggested that sp order had been established locally though the system had difficulty in achieving global phase coherence . similar behavior has been observed in random field ising model ( rfim ) systems.@xcite the slow dynamics , then , results from the expansion or contraction of the sro region as a function of time .",
    "however , we do not have quantitative information on the time evolution of the peak width .      as discussed in sec .",
    "i , one of the findings in the studies of doped cugeo@xmath2 is the close resemblance of the phase diagram for both within - chain and between - chain dopings .",
    "@xcite that is , substitution on the cu site and substitution on the ge site have yielded very similar effects on the sp phase , including rapid suppression of the sp transition temperature , occurrence of a low - temperature af phase , and the concomitant co - existence of the sp and af phases .    in this section ,",
    "we describe synchrotron x - ray diffraction experiments on cuge@xmath3si@xmath9o@xmath2 samples .",
    "as expected , most of our experimental observations are similar to the zn - doping results presented in the previous section .",
    "however , we find that si - doping is two to three times as effective in destroying the sp phase as compared to zn- or mg- doping , in agreement with earlier workers.@xcite    a representative set of longitudinal ( parallel to the scattering vector ) x - ray scans around the ( 1.5 , 1 , 1.5 ) sp dimerization peak position for the @xmath29=0.0019 , 0.0104 , and 0.0171 samples at various temperature is shown in fig .",
    "similar to the zn - doping case , the low - temperature sp peak width is resolution limited in the @xmath29=0.0019 sample , indicating that the sp phase possesses lro .",
    "on the other hand , the sp peaks in the @xmath29=0.0104 and @xmath29=0.0171 samples are broadened at all experimentally accessible temperatures , and therefore only sro is present . to extract the correlation length ,",
    "the data for all samples were fit to a two - dimensional convolution ( longitudinal and transverse directions ) of the experimentally measured gaussian resolution function with the intrinsic cross section taken as lorentzian squared .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the peak intensity and the associated inverse correlation length obtained from the fitting are shown as functions of temperature . for the @xmath29=0.0019 sample , with less than 0.2% of si substitution ,",
    "the sp transition temperature has been reduced by 1 k. however , other than that , the @xmath7=0.0019 sample behaves analogously to pure cugeo@xmath2 .",
    "the effects of doping can be more obviously seen as we gradually increase the dopant concentrations . for the samples with higher doping levels ,",
    "smearing of the order parameter onset temperature , which is reminiscent of the behavior in cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 and cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 , can be identified .",
    "in addition , over the whole temperature range studied , the @xmath29=0.0104 and the @xmath29=0.0171 samples never achieve lro and the correlation lengths at low temperatures saturate at the finite values of about 300   and 90  , respectively .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath29=0.0104 sample , this saturation of the correlation length at low temperatures is preempted by the low temperature re - entrance of the sp phase , which is characterized by a suppression of the dimerization peak intensity and a concomitant decrease in the correlation length .",
    "the re - entrance , as already elaborated in our mg doping studies,@xcite can be understood as arising from local phase separation of the sp and af micro - regions . for the @xmath29=0.0171 sample , despite the large error bars due to the low intensity , the reentrance at around 4 k is still observable from the drop in the peak intensity upon cooling from 4.5 k to 4.1 k. this temperature range also includes the nel temperature of this sample .",
    "=    =      in order to construct comprehensive temperature versus impurity concentration phase diagrams from our x - ray scattering and susceptibility measurements , we define two characteristic temperatures , both related to the sp transition but defined by the physics on different length - scales .",
    "the higher transition temperature @xmath30 , is defined as the temperature corresponding to the peak temperature of the critical fluctuations as measured from diffuse scattering intensity .",
    "we defined the counterpart of @xmath30 in the bulk susceptibility measurements as the temperature at which the derivative of the susceptibility ( @xmath31 ) reaches a maximum .",
    "the lower transition temperature t@xmath32 is defined as the temperature at which the lattice dimerization achieved lro , that is , when the inverse correlation length reaches zero , which in our case means @xmath33 @xmath27 .    for the @xmath7=0 data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , there is no ambiguity in the definition of @xmath6 .",
    "the superlattice peak intensity vanishes above @xmath34=14.1 k while the corresponding correlation length diverges precipitously at the same temperature . in the inset",
    ", we show the diffuse scattering intensity at the wing ( @xmath35 ) of the dimerization peak .",
    "it is clear that the critical fluctuation amplitude reaches a maximum at 14.1 k as well .",
    "the susceptibility measurement shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] also exhibits a sharp kink anomaly at 14.1 k , at which temperature the derivative shows a sharp peak . from these observations , we find @xmath36 k for @xmath7=0 .",
    "physically this means that the temperature at which the spin gap appears coincides with the temperature at which long - range coherence of the dimerization is achieved .",
    "this perfect agreement by two different techniques , one magnetic and one structural , proves that the sp transition is a well - defined second order phase transition and it also demonstrates the equivalence of the two definitions for the transition temperature .",
    "however , as discussed in our previous papers and as is evident from the data presented in this paper , a discrepancy develops between these two definitions as one progresses into the doped regime .",
    "it is then difficult to define @xmath6 unambiguously .    =    =    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show the experimental results for the @xmath7=0.0235 sample . in the upper panel where x - ray measurements of the dimerization peak are presented ,",
    "we find smearing of the onset temperature of the order parameter , with substantial intensity starting to appear around 10 k while the critical fluctuation amplitude reaches a maximum around 9.3 k. at the same time , the correlation length does not diverge until the temperature reaches @xmath37 k on cooling . in the bottom panel ,",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements are shown on the same temperature scale .",
    "the kink anomaly corresponding to the sp transition is rounded and the derivative of the susceptibility shows a broad peak around @xmath38 k. if a linear extrapolation method , which was adopted in ref .  , is used , we obtain@xmath39 k. these seemingly contradictory results partially explain the difference among the varied phase diagrams reported in the literature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we plot the @xmath40 phase diagram for cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 using the above definitions from both x - ray and susceptibility results .",
    "our phase diagram is in several ways distinctive : the phase boundaries determined by different definitions of @xmath6 do not match each other except for @xmath7=0 , with the divergence increasing as the doping level increases .",
    "the phase boundary determined from @xmath41 is nearly vertical around @xmath7=0.027 .",
    "no lro can be attained above this concentration level , although substantial intensity at the dimerization peak position is still observed .",
    "note that the af transition in the susceptibility measurement at @xmath7=0.027 is also broadened . on the other hand , the phase boundary determined from @xmath30 follows an approximately linear variation with the zn concentration .",
    "in particular , for @xmath7=0.034 , while @xmath41 can not be defined due to the lack of lro , one can still determine @xmath30 because there still exists substantial intensity at the dimerization peak position in the critical temperature regime .    in fig .",

    "the value of @xmath42 is slightly less than half that of the critical concentration @xmath8=0.021 and @xmath8=0.027 in the mg- and in zn - doped cases , respectively .",
    "also , one should note that the slope of the linear line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is two to three times that in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , which suggests that the si - doping is more than twice as effective in destroying the sp phase as the within - chain mg and zn dopants .",
    "previous workers have rationalized this by noting that the si - dopant affects more than one chain.@xcite in addition , as we shall discuss in the next section , the si will create a random elastic field on the cu site which in a pseudo - spin description will act like a random field which is also destructive of the order .",
    "the first conundrum in the diluted cugeo@xmath2 problem is why the sp phase is destroyed by only @xmath43% zn or mg and even less in the si case . in comparison",
    ", a much higher doping concentration is required to destroy the haldane gapped state in the @xmath44 spin chain.@xcite khomskii _",
    "@xcite first proposed a soliton model as a starting point for the study of the doped cugeo@xmath2 problem .",
    "the soliton picture is consistent with both numerical simulations@xcite and experiments .",
    "@xcite however , khomskii and coworkers note that if diluted cugeo@xmath2 is treated in a simple percolation picture , then the soliton model naturally yields a critical concentration @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath8 is determined by the concentration at which the average dopant spacing equals the soliton width .",
    "this implies that there must be a separate mechanism that is responsible for the rapid destruction of the sp phase .      in order to discuss this ,",
    "we follow harris _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and map the dimerized sp system onto an effective 3d ising model , in which the two dimer configurations possible in a given chain are associated with the up and down states of the ising pseudo - spins as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) .",
    "when a few cu ions are replaced by zn ions in an isolated chain , it is energetically favorable for the ising pseudo - spin to change sign across the zn dopant . in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) , we show that the dopant effectively creates an antiferromagnetic bond in the ferromagnetic pseudo - ising model .",
    "note that the dopants can cut the chains into segments with either an even or an odd number of spins in them .",
    "the  even \" segments favors the dimer configuration in which all the spins are paired , since this configuration has lower energy in comparison with the other one , which has two unpaired spins at the ends of the segments . for the  odd \" segment ,",
    "on the other hand , the two dimer configurations are energetically equivalent .",
    "according to numerical simulations,@xcite however , the soliton in the odd segments prefers to be in the center of the segment , thereby creating two smaller segments with opposite pseudo - ising spins .    as temperature is lowered , a uniformly ordered phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12](c ) is preferred , since the interchain interaction prefers to keep all the dimers in phase in order to achieve 3d lro .",
    "therefore , depending on the energetics of the interchain interaction and the soliton creation energy , locally ordered dimers with the ",
    "wrong \" pseudospin may be flipped at low temperatures .",
    "we note a similar mapping by mostovoy _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite in which the equivalent fields were taken to infinity to solve the model .",
    "the essential physics thus involves a competition between the interchain interaction which favors a uniform phase of the dimerization and the local soliton energy which is minimized by a change in phase of the dimerization at the dopant site .",
    "it is this competition between intrachain and interchain energies which leads to the fragility of the lro spin - peierls state .",
    "another system of this kind is a magnetic system with both ferro- and antiferromanetic bonds . for this system ,",
    "the ordering problem with competing interactions has been well addressed .",
    "@xcite in particular , aeppli , maletta and coworkers proposed a phenomenological cluster spin - glass model @xcite to explain the evolution of the ground state from ferromagnetic lro to spin - glass .",
    "we should emphasize that our observation in doped cugeo@xmath2 of a lorentzian squared cross section instead of lorentzian is significant . by way of contrast , in a simple dilution induced percolation problem , @xcite even above the percolation threshold , the diffuse scattering should always be lorentzian , which is characteristic for fluctuations of thermal or geometrical origin only .",
    "the occurrence of a lorentzian squared lineshape implies competing interaction or random field dominated physics.@xcite in the si - doped case , because of the low symmetry of the ge site the dopant will generate both competing interchain interactions and random fields .",
    "microscopic calculations are required to determine which are more important quantitatively .",
    "in addition to the unusual sp transition , the af transitions in doped cugeo@xmath2 samples also exhibit abnormal characteristics .",
    "neutron scattering experiment on 3.4% ( nominal ) zn - doped cugeo@xmath2 @xcite revealed that the af order parameter did not saturate even at 1.4 k. in addition , the transition itself was considerably rounded . fitting the order parameter using a gaussian distribution of the transition temperature , hase _ et al . _",
    "obtained @xmath46 which did not fit into any extant 3d universality class . in the @xmath47sr studies , @xcite the nel ordering process",
    "was described as an inhomogeneous process with islands of freezing spins emerging from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "although the transition was mistakenly interpreted in a spin glass picture , it revealed that the nel transition was not a homogenous process despite the fact that it yields a 3d lro magnetic state .",
    "we believe that the inhomogeneous ordering of the af transition is due to the coexistence of an inhomogeneous sp phase and the af phase involving local phase separation .    in order to understand the competition between the sp and af phases , it is illuminating to compare cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 with cu@xmath0ni@xmath1geo@xmath2 . in the case of ni - doping case,@xcite due to the non - zero magnetic moment of the ni ion",
    ", the af ordering takes place at a quite different temperature from that of zn- or mg- doping , while the effect on the sp phase boundary seems to be the same .",
    "this experimental observation suggests that the sp phase transition and the af transition should be treated independently , that is , the suppression of the sp ordering can not be simply attributed to the competition from the af ordering .",
    "although these two phases are intricately correlated as evidenced by the re - entrance of the sp phase upon the onset of the af phase , the onset of the af ordering is only indirectly related to the destruction of the sp phase .    as discussed in detail in the section on si - doping and in ref .  , we observed at approximately the same temperature as the onset of the af ordering , that the sp phase underwent a reentrant transition which was evidenced by the increase in the dimerization peak width upon cooling through nel temperature .",
    "additionally , the reentrant process was accompanied by slow dynamics and hysteresis .",
    "the reentrance and the hysteresis are unusual in the sense that they coincide with the onset of the af ordering over the doping range studied , which implies that the reentrance is directly related to the af ordering .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we propose a local phase separation scenario to explain this unusual af transition and the coexistence of the af and sp phases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , solitons bear double identities in the system , they involve both structural anti - phase domain walls for the sp phase and the free spins for the underlying magnetic system . for materials with @xmath48 or @xmath49 , the temperature is decreased below the sp transition temperature , the interchain interactions lead to the creation of a lro sp phase . for even segments ,",
    "two solitons are created at the end ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig12](c ) , while for odd segments , the solitons that were located at the center will move to the end of the segment to bind to the dopants . as a result ,",
    "a lro sp order in fact creates many solitons that bind to the dopant sites .",
    "these free spins have antiferromagnetic correlations among them , and the dimerized spins will be partially polarized to mediate the magnetic interactions . at the nel temperature",
    ", the spins eventually develop af order .",
    "we believe that the key factor in inducing the reentrance is the non - uniform nature of the af state . above the af transition ,",
    "the free spins are disordered . however , as the system is cooled , the antiferromagnetic interaction energy will become relevant .",
    "the free spins are actually mobile and can move freely in each segments .",
    "however , due to the confining potential of the interchain interations the solitons become bound to the dopants .",
    "the onset of the af state , however , will compete with this configuration because , the lowest energy state will be achieved by moving all these solitons together , in other words , phase separation into soliton - rich and soliton - poor regions , which will inevitably disrupt the originally established sp order .",
    "the final state is the result of this competition between the sp order and af order .",
    "since the solitons are bound by the dopants , the phase separation can happen only locally .",
    "it is not currently known whether the resulting state involves islands or stripes or some other geometry .",
    "further theoretical work must be done in this direction .",
    "clearly , however , the slow dynamics and re - entrance can naturally be explained in this way .",
