    "bonds and stocks issued by the same company carry the risk of the company going bankrupt . although this risk has been accounted for in pricing the bonds , see e.g. @xcite for a review of this literature , there is only a limited number of models in equity option pricing , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite .",
    "instead , models are developed to match the implied volatility curve , which is observed daily : stochastic volatility models , see e.g. @xcite , and jump diffusion models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "these models account for the default risk implicitly .",
    "these approaches could be improved accounting for the risk of default .",
    "when a company goes bankrupt and the stock of the company plunges , the out - of - the - money put options are suddenly very valuable .",
    "so , when these contracts are priced , the market must also be accounting for these crash scenarios , besides the stochastic volatility and small jump effects , and this is partly why the out of the money put options are worth much more than what the black and scholes model , which does not account for bankruptcy , would predict .",
    "in addition , one might argue that the default risk should be priced consistently across the markets .",
    "when the likelihood of the default of a company increases ( for example when a credit downgrade occurs ) , it is not unreasonable to expect that besides the increase in the yield spread , the trading volume in the out of the money put options increases and their prices go up .",
    "in fact , the more the put option is out of the money , the higher the return it will bring when there is a default , so the higher the prices should be .",
    "this is the understanding of @xcite and the convertible bond pricing literature(see",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .    in this note",
    ", we will use an intensity based approach to model the default risk of the company that issues the stock .",
    "we will also allow the volatility of the stock price to be stochastic .",
    "we observe that the implied yield spread that is obtained from calibrating all the model parameters to the option prices matches the observed yield spread ( figure 15 ) . on the other hand",
    ", our calibration exercise shows that an effective hazard rate from bonds issued by a company can be used to explain the implied volatility skew of the option prices issued by the same company .    in our model ,",
    "the volatility is driven by two processes that evolve on two different time scales , fast and slow .",
    "the intensity of default is a function of volatility and an idiosyncratic stochastic component ( since the credit market and stock options market can have independent movements ) , which is driven by two other processes that evolve on fast and slow time scales .",
    "our model is similar to that of @xcite and the motivation for our model specification can be found on page 4 of that paper .",
    "the difference of our model from the carr - wu specification is that we also incorporate the market prices of volatility and intensity risks into our model , and we consider the intensity and volatility to be evolving on two different time scales .",
    "the purpose of our specification is to be able to obtain asymptotic option price approximations using multiscale perturbation methods developed by @xcite , who used this technique in the context of stochastic volatility models .",
    "our model can be thought of as a hybrid of the stochastic volatility model of @xcite ( whose purpose is to obtain approximations for stock option prices ) and the multi - scale intensity model of @xcite ( whose purpose is to price credit derivatives ) .",
    "but one should note that following the carr - wu specification we allow the intensity to depend on the volatility , and we also incorporate the market price of default risk into our model .",
    "let us also point out that our default model differs from @xcite and @xcite since they consider a model in which the intensity of the defaults depends solely on the stock price .",
    "our price approximation for the option prices has seven parameters ( we will refer to it as the 7 parameter model ) , one of which is the average intensity , that can be calibrated to the observed implied volatility .",
    "we compare the performance of this model against 3 simpler models : [ 5 parameter model ] a model that does not account for the market price of intensity risk ; [ the model of @xcite ] a model that does not account for the default risk ; [ 3 parameter model ] a model that does not account for the stochastic volatility effects . when we take the average intensity to be equal to the yield spread of the corporate bond with smallest maturity and",
    "calibrate the rest of the parameters to the observed option prices we observe that the seven parameter model not only outperforms the others ( which is to be expected ) but also that it almost fits the data implied volatility perfectly for longer term options ( 9 months and over ) .",
    "( in our calibration we pool the options with different strikes and different maturities in the same pool and we have 104 data points , we consider maturities from 3 months to 2 years ) .",
    "the 5 parameter model always outperforms the model of @xcite , which points to the significance of accounting for the default risk .",
    "although , the three parameter model has only two free parameters ( the other free parameter is the average intensity of default and is already fixed to be the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond ) it fits the implied volatility surface fairly well , considering that we have 104 data points .",
    "see section 3.2 .",
    "when we calibrate all parameters of each model , including the average intensity , to the option prices then all the models we consider ( except the model of @xcite since this model does not account for the default risk ) fit the the data implied volatility curve quite well ( even the 3 parameter model ) .",
    "but when option implied average intensity is plotted against the yield curve of the shortest maturity bond over the entire period of the data ( about a year ) , one observes that all models except the 7 parameter model have unrealistically severe option implied intensities .",
    "only the 7 parameter model almost matches the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond ( the maturity is about two years on the last day of our data ) .",
    "therefore , it might be possible to derive the risk neutral probability of default from the option prices using the 7 parameter model .",
    "see section 3.3 .",
    "also we should note that the 7 and 5 parameter models have much richer implied volatility surface structure ( see figures  [ fig : s3p ] , [ fig : s5p ] , [ fig : sfp ] , and [ fig : s7p ] ) and section 2.3 , which explains why they fit to the option prices better .    we should note that we calibrate the parameters of our model to the daily observed option prices as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite on the other hand perform a time series analysis to obtain the parameters of their model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce our model specification . in section  [ sec : eop ] , we derive an approximation of the prices of the equity options , and in section 2.2 we derive an approximation to the corporate bond prices , using multi - scale perturbation techniques . in section 2.3",
    "we analyze the model implied volatility surface structure of the models we consider . in section 3",
    ", we calibrate the 7 parameter model and the other reference models to the data .",
    "we will use the doubly - stochastic poisson process framework of @xcite , see also @xcite . let @xmath0 be a filtered probability space hosting standard brownian motions @xmath1 , whose correlation structure is given by ( 2.8 ) and standard poisson process @xmath2 independent of @xmath3 .",
    "these brownian motion will be used in modeling the the volatility and the intensity ( see ( 2.6)).we model the time of default , which we will denote by @xmath4 , as the first time the process the time changed poisson process @xmath5 , @xmath6 , jumps .",
    "the stock price dynamics in our framework is the solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath7 in which we take the interest rate @xmath8 to be deterministic as carr and wu ( 2006 ) and linetsky ( 2006 ) do . at the time of default the stock price jumps down to zero .",
    "note that the discounted stock price is a martingale under the measure @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the natural filtration of @xmath3 .",
    "the price of a european call option with maturity @xmath11 is equal to @xmath12=\\mathbb{e}\\left[b(t , t ) e^{-\\int_t^{t}\\lambda_s ds}(s_t - k)^+\\bigg|\\mathcal{f}_t\\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] in which @xmath13 is the price of the bond that matures at time @xmath14 , whereas the price of a european put option is given by @xmath15 \\\\&=kb(t , t)-\\mathbb{e}\\left[b(t , t)e^{-\\int_t^{t}\\lambda_s ds}\\min(k , s_t)\\bigg|\\mathcal{f}_t\\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] in which @xmath16 is the solution of @xmath17 from ( [ eq : price - option ] ) and ( [ eq : dyn - stock ] ) we see that pricing a call option on a defaultable stock is equivalent to pricing a call option in a fictitious market that does not default but whose interest rate is stochastic ( also see @xcite ) . using ( [ eq : price - option ] ) and ( [ eq : price - option - put ] ) , the put - call parity is satisfied , @xmath18 as expected .",
    "we will use a model specification similar to that of @xcite and assume the following dynamics for the volatility @xmath19 and the intensity @xmath20 : @xmath21 in which @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the market prices of volatility risk , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the market prices of intensity risk .",
    "we will assume the following correlation structure for the brownian motions in our model : @xmath27&=\\rho_i t , \\quad i=1 ,   2,\\\\ e[w^{(1)}_t , w^{(2)}_t]&=\\rho_{12 } t , \\quad e[w^{(3)}_t , w^{(4)}_t]=\\rho_{34 } t , \\\\ e[w^{(i)}_t , w^{(3)}_t]&=0 , \\quad i=0 , 1 , 2 , \\quad   e[w^{(i)}_t , w^{(4)}_t]=0 , \\quad i=0 , 1 , 2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for all @xmath6 .",
    "this model captures the covariation of the implied volatility and the spread of risky bonds , and it also accommodates the fact that the credit market and the stock market can show independent movements ( see section 1.1 of @xcite for further motivation ) .",
    "one should note that when @xmath28 , our model specification for the intensity coincides with that of @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath29 our model specification becomes that of @xcite .",

    "( observe that since we fixed @xmath127 to be the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond there are only 6 parameters to calibrate ) .",
    "but the 7 parameter model does not only outperform the other models but also fits the data implied volatility almost perfectly .",
    "7 parameter model outperforms the other models by a lot for very small and very large strikes .",
    "another interesting observation is that the 5 parameter model of ( [ eq : comp - mod-1 ] ) always outperforms ( again since the @xmath127 is set to be the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond ) the model of @xcite which is the same as ( [ eq : comp - mod-1 ] ) except that the @xmath127 is set to zero instead of being set to the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond .",
    "this shows the significance of taking the yield spread of the corporate bonds into account in pricing options .",
    "note that although the model of ( [ eq : comp - mod-2 ] ) had only two free parameters , it performed fairly well ( considering that we had 104 data points available ) .",
    "also note that , the performance of the 7 parameter model deteriorates as the time to maturity becomes smaller .",
    "this is because for the shorter maturity options one should use shorter term yield spreads .",
    "[ [ when - the - hazard - rate - barlambda - is - inferred - from - market - option - prices - directly ] ] when the hazard rate @xmath127 is inferred from market option prices directly ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in this section , we will analyze whether it would be possible to infer the risk neural expected time of default if we calibrate the models of ( [ eq : app - opt - price ] ) , ( [ eq : comp - mod-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : comp - mod-2 ] ) to the data implied volatility . that is along with the other parameters ,",
    "if we also let @xmath127 be decided by the prices of the options would it be possible to say something about the yield spread of the corporate bonds .",
    "since each model has one extra free variable , namely @xmath127 , to fit to the data implied volatility , not surprisingly , the performance of each model enhances , see figures  [ fig:9m - iter ] , [ fig:1y - iter ] , [ fig:1.5y - iter ] and [ fig:2y - iter ] .",
    "but the enhancement is not an ordinary one : all of our three models fit the data exceptionally well , even the three parameter model in ( [ eq : comp - mod-2 ] ) .",
    "the improvement in the most advanced model is the smallest .",
    "but then when we compare the data implied yield spread versus the yield spread of the shortest maturity bond , see figures  [ fig : intensity-3p ] , [ fig : intensity-5p ] and [ fig : intensity-7p ] , the story is a little bit different .",
    "the implied yield spread , @xmath127 of the 3 parameter model of ( [ eq : comp - mod-2 ] ) is much larger than that of the yield spread of the shortest maturity corporate bond . since",
    ", the 3 parameter model does not account for volatility , the implied yield spread is drastically severe .",
    "for the 5 parameter model the difference seems to be less severe , since the model accounts for the stochastic volatility effects , but the difference between the yield spread curves is still noticeable . on the other hand , the implied yield spread for the 7 parameter model of ( [ eq : app - opt - price ] ) seems to fit the yield spread of the corporate bond almost perfectly .",
    "the difference between the 7 parameter and the 5 parameter values is that the former one accounts for the market price of intensity risk ."
