    "typically one searches for optimal _ steady state _ conditions , possibly stabilized through feedback loops ; yet it is also well - known that non - steady - state operating conditions may lead to better average performance  @xcite .",
    "examples of such chemical engineering processes include fast pressure swing adsorption  @xcite and reverse flow reactors  @xcite .",
    "improvement of the average process performance under non - steady - state conditions ( e.g. periodically varying reaction conditions ) can sometimes be rationalized through certain resonances between the characteristic operation time scale ( e.g. the period of forcing ) and the intrinsic time scales of the system @xcite .",
    "catalytic reaction systems often exhibit rich nonlinear dynamic behavior , including spatiotemporal patterns such as propagating reacting fronts , pulses , rotating spirals and even chaos  @xcite .",
    "since the emergence of these spatiotemporal patterns is governed by the system intrinsic time and length scales , catalytic systems may be promising testing fields for optimal non - steady - state operating policies  @xcite .",

    "related advances in spatiotemporally addressing catalytic surfaces at the micron scale , in particular through computer - controlled laser beams , have enabled us to spatiotemporally modify local reaction conditions in real time : pulses and fronts , the building blocks of spatiotemporal patterns , can be initiated , erased or guided through appropriate local laser actuation in space and time  @xcite . in a previous experimental study of modifying the local catalytic surface activity in co oxidation on pt(110 ) through local laser actuation , it was discovered that optimal laser scanning policies exist , maximizing overall reaction ( i.e. co@xmath0 production ) rate when the system is close to the excitable regime  @xcite .",
    "the reaction conditions used in those experiments were selected in a way such that the system was initially at a co - poisoned state ( with pt surface dominated by adsorbed co which leads to low co@xmath0 production rate ) , but could become locally excitable upon local laser heating .",
    "the actuation of the laser beam converts the local pt surface to an excitable state by increasing the local temperature and hence accelerating the desorption of co. when the laser beam is kept at a fixed position , reacting oxygen pulses are periodically initiated around the laser heating center , and propagate away with significant higher local reaction rate .",
    "when the laser beam is scanned at a constant speed , it continuously locally excites the pt surface  @xcite . depending on the intensity of the laser , the spatiotemporal  policy \" at which it scans the surface , its scanning speed , and the characteristic times required for the surface to return -after excitation- to the quenched state , different maxima in the overall co@xmath0 production rate",

    "this is attempted through modelling of the appropriate catalytic reaction - diffusion system with spatiotemporal laser actuation . as a first step",

    "we make the following two simplifications @xcite : a ) the heat generated by the co oxidation reaction on the pt(110 ) surface ( @xmath41 mw/@xmath34 ) is neglected compared to the power of the laser beam ( @xmath41 w for a crystal surface of 75 @xmath42 m in diameter ( size of the laser spot ) ) ; b ) we consider that the local temperature profile inhomogeneity is established ( and then vanishes ) instantly as the laser beam is applied ( and then removed ) .",

    "the local maximum for isotropic co diffusion was associated with the development of a pulse instability caused by laser dragging and apparently involving the dragged pulse continuous spectrum . when anisotropic co diffusion is included in the model , and for a wide range of laser scanning speeds , the system exhibits comparable _ averaged _ rate enhancement response ; yet",
