    "the results of the macho project indicate that about @xmath5% of the dark matter in the milky way halo is baryonic , and made of faint objects with typical masses around @xmath6 ( alcock et al .",
    "one possibility is that these objects are stellar remnants from old populations , even though their initial mass function may be extreme ( chabrier et al .",
    "if some stars form before galaxies , they would remain collisionless , populating the galactic halos just like elementary cold dark matter particles ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 , loeb 1997 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , a simple question to answer would be : are there old populations of stars observed in the halos of other galaxies which , on dynamical grounds , are known to have large amounts of dark matter ? in order to answer this question , some obvious galaxies to target are the dwarf irregulars . these galaxies are known to be dark matter dominated , having rising rotation curves that extend beyond their optical limits ( carignan & freeman 1988 ) .",
    "a typical case is ngc  3109 , which is located in the outskirts of the local group ( van den bergh 1994 , mateo 1998 ) .",
    "this galaxy is far enough not to have been affected by interactions with the larger local group spirals , yet close enough that it can be resolved into stars .",
    "ngc 3109 has been relatively well studied : some of its parameters are listed in table 1 ( see mateo 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we note that ngc  3109 is on the bright end of the family of local group dwarf irregulars , almost as luminous as the lmc ( table 1 ) .",
    "this galaxy has a system of globular clusters ( demers et al .",
    "lee ( 1993 ) showed the differences between the color - magnitude diagrams of the ngc  3109 disk and a field located 2 arcmin away from it .",
    "the outer field seems to be dominated by an old and metal - poor population .",
    "earlier , sandage ( 1971 ) pointed out that direct photographs of all galaxies in the local group reveal the presence of a background sheet of red stars , and that the brightest of these stars are at the tip of the red giant branch of a globular cluster - like population .",
    "based on these pieces of evidence , and motivated by the discovery of a halo made of population ii stars in the dwarf irregular galaxy wlm ( minniti & zijlstra 1996 ) , we decided to investigate if a similar halo component is indeed present in ngc 3109 .",
    "hereafter we define pop ii as the stellar component that is very old ( @xmath7 yr ) , and metal - poor ( @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ) ( see the reviews of hodge 1989 and mateo 1998 for a discussion of star formation histories and pop ii stars in the local group galaxies ) .",
    "in this paper we present deep optical photometry covering a large field centered on ngc  3109 , which allows a detailed photometric study of individual stars and stellar populations in this galaxy .",
    "the observations of ngc  3109 , data reductions , and photometry are described in section 2 and the resulting color - magnitude diagrams are given in section 3 , along with a discussion about reddening .",
    "the spatial distribution of the different stellar populations is discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents the luminosity function of ngc  3109 .",
    "fundamental parameters of ngc  3109 , such as metallicity , age and distance , are determined in section 6 .",
    "section 7 discusses other population tracers , namely star clusters , carbon stars , hii regions , planetary nebulae , cepheid variables , co and hi observations .",
    "the formation and evolution of ngc  3109 are discussed in section 8 and the conclusions of this work are summarized in section 9 .",
    "the observations of ngc  3109 were obtained during the night of january 7 , 1995 , as part of a long term monitoring program of the variable stars in several galaxies ( zijlstra et al .",
    "we used the red arm ( rild mode ) of the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) at the new technology telescope ( ntt ) in la silla , operated remotely from the eso headquarters in garching , germany ( see zijlstra et al .",
    "the weather was photometric , with seeing varying from @xmath10 to @xmath11 during the night .",
    "we used the 2048@xmath122048 tek ccd , with a scale of @xmath13 pix@xmath14 .",
    "the observations of the ngc  3109 galaxy were secured with the johnson @xmath15 and cousins @xmath16 filters .",
    "they consist of pairs of frames taken at mean airmass 1.1 , with exposure times 900 sec in @xmath16 , and 1800 sec in @xmath15 .",
    "these frames , shown in figure 1 , are centered on the galaxy coordinates listed in table 1 .",
    "a total of 5 standards of landolt ( 1992 ) were observed during the night in order to calibrate our photometry .",
    "the reductions of the ccd frames were carried out following standard procedures , using the package ccdred within the iraf environment .",
    "the pairs of images in each filter were combined , the final fwhm of stellar images being 0.9 and 0.8 arcsec in v and i , respectively .",
    "an additional pair of 900-sec @xmath16-band frames ( airmass 1.25 ) was obtained @xmath17 south of the center of the galaxy during the night of april 16 , 1996 , in order to account for field contamination and study the possible presence of an extended halo around this galaxy .",
    "these @xmath16-band images were processed in similar way as the previous data .",
    "the location of the background frame in the sky is directly to the south of the main ngc  3109 field shown in figure 1 .",
    "the field to the s of ngc  3109 is rich in background galaxies .",
    "the fields cover most of the light of the galaxy included within the outer contours @xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath19 of the surface photometry of jobin & carignan ( 1990 ) , and our deep photometry extends beyond the holmberg radius ( @xmath20 arcmin ) .",
    "the total area covered is @xmath21 .",
    "the photometric transformations to the standard system were done following the procedure described by minniti & zijlstra ( 1997 ) .",
    "these transformations reproduce the magnitudes of the standard stars with an @xmath22 of 0.016 in v and 0.031 in i.    the photometric measurements were performed within the iraf environment , using daophot ii which is an improved version of the original daophot package developed by stetson ( 1987 ) . in particular , daophot ii can accommodate a spatially varying point - spread function across the field .",
    "this is needed for our frames , which cover a large field .",
    "all stars in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 frames of ngc  3109 with more than 5@xmath23 above the background were located , and their magnitudes measured by fitting a moffat point - spread function . the resulting limiting magnitudes ( @xmath24 ) are v@xmath25 , and i@xmath26 .",
    "as expected , the completeness is worse in the more crowded disk region of ngc  3109 ( @xmath27 ) than in the outer regions ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , the present photometry is sufficiently deep that none of our results will depend on the completeness of the sample at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "ngc 3109 is located at a relatively low galactic latitude ( @xmath29 ) , and contamination by foreground stars becomes an issue .",
    "the foreground stars from the galactic halo and disk should appear as a plume of stars in the color - magnitude diagram with mean color @xmath30 , and a total color range covering about @xmath31 .",
    "the contamination from these stars can be estimated from star counts in a strip along declination of @xmath32 arcmin , offset by 10 arcmin from the ngc  3109 major axis .",
    "the observed density of red stars in this region is @xmath331 stars / arcmin@xmath34 with @xmath35 , and 4 stars / arcmin@xmath34 with @xmath36 . from the galactic model of ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 )",
    ", we expect 0.7 foreground halo stars / arcmin@xmath34 with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in this low - latitude field .    since the galaxy / star ratio increases rapidly for faint magnitudes",

    "the population differences are significant .",
    "figure 4 is similar to the color - magnitude diagrams of the central @xmath75 arcmin@xmath34 of lee ( 1993 ) , confirming that the population differences between disk and halo extend to a larger area and to both sides of the plane of this galaxy .",

    "these diagrams are similar , with the ngc  3109 giant branch being slightly bluer , indicating a slightly more metal - poor population . also , the fwhm of the ngc  3109 giant branch is similar to that of wlm , in spite of the fact that the giant stars in ngc  3109 are nearly a magnitude fainter than the giant stars in wlm of identical intrinsic luminosity .",

    "most of the stars detected in the v frames down to @xmath80 are concentrated in the disk of the galaxy , within @xmath812.5 arcmin of the major axis ( equivalent to @xmath82 kpc projected distance from the plane of this galaxy ) .",

    "disk reddening will not affect the halo population .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath54 is also shown in figure 7 .",
    "the red stars with @xmath89 are less concentrated than the blue stars with @xmath90 , extending as far out as @xmath91 .",
    "the appearance of this diagram can be understood in terms of a superposition of an extended old and metal - poor population , plus a younger , more concentrated component , where scatter may be introduced by possible differential reddening and by star crowding in the inner regions .",
    "the hi extends almost as far out as the ngc  3109 halo , to @xmath92 arcmin , as shown by the hi maps ( jobin & carignan 1990 ) .",
    "there is evidence of a warp in the disk of this galaxy from these hi maps .",
    "we will assume that the extended component belongs to the halo and not to a highly warped disk , because the populations are too different . if the old metal poor component observed away from the projected plane of ngc  3109 were in the warp , the disk itself must have a strong population gradient .",
    "we can not measure the flattening of the ngc  3109 halo , because this halo clearly extends outside of our fields in the e - w direction .",
    "only an upper limit to the flattening can be derived , @xmath93 , given by the fact that the total disk extent is at least 11 arcmin ( demers et al .",
    "if the halo flattening were the same as the disk seen in projection ( @xmath94 ) , this halo must have an extension of about @xmath95 arcmin in the e - w direction . for a rounder halo , with @xmath96",
    ", this extension would be about @xmath97 arcmin .",
    "note that the halos of the large spirals of the local group , mw and m31 , are also flattened .",

    "two distinct features can be seen in the luminosity function : a sharp break at @xmath102 due to the termination of the halo - like rgb , and another break at @xmath103 due to the termination of the agb .",

    "these stars are located within the main body of the galaxy .",
    "hodge ( 1969 ) found that ngc  3109 contains several hii regions .",
    "these hii regions are mostly minor , as ngc  3109 is not very active in forming stars .",
    "ten hii regions identified from [ oiii]@xmath134 images have been studied recently by richer & mccall ( 1992 ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the color magnitude diagrams of the regions surrounding these hii regions .",
    "they were made using fields with @xmath135 pix on a side , or @xmath136 arcmin@xmath34 . the panels of figure 11 give a panoramic view on the ages of the stars in the hii region fields . using the brightest main sequence stars we can set limits on the ages of the youngest stars in these regions .",
    "table 2 lists the positions of the shell centers in our images , the fields covered , the age limits derived from the blue main sequence stars and red blue - loop stars , and the total numbers of stars plotted in figure 11 . in all cases , there clearly are very young stars present in the fields of the hii regions .",
    "we note that in these regions of the galaxy , there is unresolved background .",
    "we also see different blue edge colors for the main sequence stars , evidence of different amounts of obscuration .",
    "the ages measured for these regions are consistent with some star formation in the recent past , that has been more or less continuous , as discussed by greggio et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "richer & mccall ( 1995 ) measure a low metallicity @xmath137 , equivalent to about @xmath55 , similar to the smc and wlm . within the errors ,",
    "this abundance is consistent with the stellar abundance derived here , suggesting moderately low star - formation rate in the past . since the gas reflects the cumulative process of enrichment along the life of a galaxy , in the absence of infall one",
    "is led to conclude that the past star - formation activity was not substantial enough to raise this composition significantly .",
    "thus , the metallicities of the disk stars inferred from the color - magnitude diagrams are in agreement with the gas compositions .    shells and supershells have been found in ngc  3109 from h@xmath138 surveys ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "1993 ) , revealing a complex interstellar medium and active star formation .",
    "the panels of figure 12 show the color - magnitude diagrams of the regions of supershells 3 and 4 , and shells 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8 , 11 , and 12 .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1993 ) pointed out that not all of these shells are surrounding bright blue stars .",
    "we can quantify this statement using the deep vi photometry .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams shown in figure 12 cover fields with 100 pixels on a side ( @xmath136 arcmin@xmath34 ) centered in these shells . as with the hii regions , using the brightest main sequence stars we can set limits on the ages of the youngest stars in these regions .",
    "these age limits are also listed in table 2 , along with the central positions of the shells , the field covered , and the total number of stars plotted .",
    "we caution that these panels show all the stars projected along the line of sight , some of which may be foreground or background to the shells , but still within the ngc  3109 disk .",
    "most of these shells surround groups of very young stars .",
    "however , it is clear that not all these regions contain very young stars that would drive the gaseous material away .",
    "in particular , the color - magnitude diagrams of shells 6 , 11 and 12 are dominated by old stars .",
    "shells 11 and 12 are located above the plane of ngc  3109 , explaining the smaller number of stars in their color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "richer & mccall ( 1992 ) found 7 planetary nebulae in ngc  3109 based on @xmath139 \\lambda 5007 $ ]   images .",
    "they used their luminosity distribution to estimate a distance to this galaxy , concluding that @xmath140 . even though this value is larger than the present estimate , their quoted error bars of about 0.5 mag makes this distance also consistent with our results .    during an ntt observing run in december 1996 we obtained a 900 second exposure centered on ngc  3109 with the sii narrow - band filter ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "because it is redder than @xmath139 \\lambda 5007\\aa$ ] , this filter is well suited to find obscured planetary nebulae . unfortunately , there is a shift of wavelength sensitivity with position in the detector that is not well mapped , and our search area may be smaller than the actual @xmath142 arcmin observed . in any case , we have not detected any other bright pn in the central regions of ngc  3109 .",
    "sandage & carlson ( 1988 ) discovered 29 cepheids in ngc  3109 , and used them to measure the distance of this galaxy .",
    "the most recent study by musella et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reports bvri photometry for 36 candidate cepheids .",
    "they use the lmc cepheid period - luminosity relation to obtain a relative distance modulus of @xmath143 mag between the lmc and ngc  3109 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath144 , for @xmath145 .",
    "this distance is in excellent agreement with our result . our ongoing monitoring project ( zijlstra et al .",
    "1996a ) will detect all the cepheids down to @xmath146 in this galaxy .",
    "dwarf irregulars are dominated by dark matter halos , their total m / l being larger than for normal spiral galaxies ( jobin & carignan 1990 , ct 1995 ) .",
    "the most recent hi maps of ngc  3109 are given by jobin & carignan ( 1990 ) , who mapped the whole galaxy at high resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the hi emission is detected out to 3.5 - 4.0 arcmin from the ngc 3109 disk , almost as far as the stars in the halo component found here .",
    "jobin & carignan ( 1990 ) also give a detailed hi rotation curve for ngc  3109 based on these observations .",
    "the amplitude of this curve is large for such a small galaxy ( @xmath147 km / s ) , implying a high m / l .",
    "indeed , ngc  3109 is taken as a typical dwarf irregular galaxy with a sizeable dark matter halo ( navarro et al .",
    "by analogy with other spirals of the local group , we define halo as an old and metal - poor population of stars that are distributed in a spheroid . such a population would be kinematically hot , with small rotation and large velocity dispersion .",
    "more quantitatively , a halo of pop ii stars is defined here as @xmath148 yr old and metal - poor @xmath2 \\leq -1 $ ] stars ( see the reviews by hodge 1989 and mateo 1998 ) .",
    "mould & kristian ( 1986 ) established the presence of pop ii halos in m33 and m31 based on the rgb morphology , before there was kinematic information about these halos .",
    "later confirmation that these halos were kinematically hot came for example from radial velocities of globular clusters ( schommer et al .",
    "1992 , brodie & huchra 1991 ) .",
    "the present observations show that ngc  3109 has an old and metal - poor population of stars that is more extended than the younger , bluer stars that are located within the disk of the galaxy . while the evidence suggests that this population forms a halo such as seen in local group spirals , this requires confirmation from kinematics , which can show if this population does not participate in the rotation of the disk .",
    "useful targets for radial velocity measurements would be the candidate clusters of demers et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and individual giants in this galaxy .",
    "all well studied galaxies of the local group , regardless of type and luminosity , seem to have population ii stars .",
    "this conclusion was based on the presence of globular clusters , rr lyrae variables , or blue horizontal branches and metal - poor giants ( hodge 1989 , da costa 1994 , grebel 1998 , mateo 1998 ) . in the case of ngc  3109 ,",
    "the only evidence was given by the presence of several candidate globular clusters .",
    "the present work strengthens the evidence of an old and metal - poor halo in this galaxy .",
    "note that the presence of a halo population around dir galaxies may be common : minniti & zijlstra ( 1996 , 1997 ) , and aparicio et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have found such a population in the dir galaxies wlm and antlia , respectively .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", the existence of such halos would be very significant in the cosmological context , since it may be related to dark matter halos , if the dark matter is baryonic ( alcock et al . 1997 )",
    ". a population of low mass pre - galactic stars would be essentially collisionless ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 , loeb 1997 ) , populating the diffuse halos of galaxies such as ngc  3109 .",
    "the degree to which the massive compact objects detected through microlensing are related to the old halos observed in dwarf irregulars like wlm and ngc  3109 is heavily dependent on the initial mass functions ( e.g. chabrier et al .",
    "unfortunately , these galaxies are distant enough to prevent observations of their old main sequence .",
    "the only information available so far comes from evolved stars , and their initial mass functions remain unconstrained .",
    "the old main sequence is within reach for galaxies out to about 1 mpc , using stis at the hubble space telescope ( gregg & minniti 1997 ) .",
    "the existence of a pop ii halo in dwarf irregular galaxies such as ngc  3109 and wlm is also important in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "ngc  3109 and wlm give examples of very small mass galaxies that have formed halos of their own .",
    "because they have a small mass , merging of smaller subunits or strong interactions seem less likely than in the milky way , for example ( particularly in the case of wlm ) . in our galaxy",
    ", the formation of the halo may have occured in part by accretion of smaller satellites , as predicted by the cdm clustering model ( e.g. white 1996 ) .",
    "these two galaxies formed at the edge of the local group but in opposite sides .",
    "indeed , peebles ( 1995 ) finds that ngc  3109 , like wlm , has turned around from the hubble flow and is free falling towards the local group center of mass .",
    "the recently discovered antlia dwarf is the nearest known companion to ngc  3109 , at a projected separation @xmath149 kpc ( aparicio et al .",
    "their relative velocity is @xmath150 km s@xmath14 ( aparicio et al .",
    "1997b ) , much smaller than the typical velocity differences of local group galaxies ( @xmath151 km s@xmath14 ) , suggesting that these galaxies may be associated .",
    "we speculate that at this relative velocity they may have suffered a close encounter within the last gyr , triggering or sustaining the star formation .",
    "we have obtained deep vi photometry of about 17500 stars in the field of the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  3109 , located at the edge of the local group .",
    "we study the structure of ngc  3109 , in particular examining the spatial distribution of blue ( young ) and red ( older ) stars .",
    "the main result of this work is to establish the presence of an extended stellar halo , down to very faint levels . the stars populating this halo are clearly different from the stars that make the ngc  3109 disk : they are old and metal - poor ( figure 3 ) .    from the vi color - magnitude diagram",
    "we infer metallicities and ages for the stellar populations in the main body and in the halo of ngc  3109 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams also allow us to confirm a low reddening for this galaxy , @xmath67 .",
    "we give an approximate determination of the age of the ngc  3109 halo , independent of the reddening and distance to this galaxy , concluding that it is very old ( @xmath152 yr ) .",
    "the age measurement depends on the metallicity , which is accurately determined from the color of the rgb , and which agrees with previous determinations in the main body of the galaxy ( richer & mccall 1995 ) .",
    "this halo is also metal - poor , with @xmath2=-1.8\\pm 0.2 $ ] , characteristic of pop ii stars .",
    "we construct deep optical and bolometric luminosity functions , obtaining an accurate distance for this galaxy @xmath153 , based on the rgb tip of the metal poor stellar component .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with recent distance determinations using cepheids ( musella et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the real significance of dir galaxies as possible elements contributing to build larger galaxies like our own has been overlooked , perhaps under the assumption that , like the lmc , they do not have pop ii halos . however , we find that dir galaxies can have halos .",
    "ngc  3109 represents another such case after wlm ( minniti & zijlstra 1996 ) , where no spiral arms , nucleus or bulge are present , but where a disk formed dissipatively within an old and metal - poor halo .",
    "measuring the kinematics of the ngc  3109 disk and halo components using radial velocities of individual giants is the necessary next step .",
    "this would be within the reach of current instrumentation : the eso very large telescope equipped with fors would be ideally suited for getting accurate enough radial velocities of large numbers of individual ngc  3109 giants .",
    "these observations would unambiguosly determine if the ngc  3109 halo is kinematically hotter ( with smaller rotation and larger velocity dispersion ) than the disk , as we would predict based on the present work .",
