    "much of the information obtained in laser experiments comes in the form of spectral data . in steady state ,",
    "these are supposed to give the fourier transform of the energy level structure of the system under investigation . in this manner",
    "we have been able to learn about the quantum configurations of atoms , molecules and solid state systems .",
    "today , however , much work is done with pulsed laser sources , where the pulse duration samples the evolution of the system over times ranging from nanoseconds to femtoseconds .",
    "spectral data are still recorded , but their significance and physical information is no longer straightforward .",
    "thus one needs to reconsider the definition and computation with due consideration of the physical conditions under which the data are obtained .",
    "several attempts have been made to modify the fourier - transform definition , the wiener - khintchine spectrum @xcite , but here we choose to consider the physical spectrum introduced by eberly and wdkiewicz @xcite , which attempts to emulate the spectral measurements using e.g a fabry - perot filter in front of the detector . they have applied it to the well known case of the fluorescence mollow spectrum @xcite .",

    "in this paper we consider the problem of obtaining spectral data in an evolving system .",

    "the spectral measurements require a filtering , which smeares the signal in time .",
    "the frequency - time resolution has to obey an uncertainty relation .",
    "in addition , the exact nature of the transfer of spectral information from the system investigated to the detector imposes its own limitations .",
    "there can be no unique spectral definition for time - dependent systems , but we can require that all definitions agree when infinite measurement times are available .    in a laboratory experiment , the radiation emitted from a driven system reaches the detector through a technical setup which , in addition to its function as a filter , will impose its own noise limits .",
    "the filtering action provides a noisy channel .",
    "this is , however , just the situation which is described by the term `` open system '' @xcite .",
    "we want to consider an open systems approach to time - dependent spectra .",
    "a natural frequency - selective detector is a two - level atom .",
    "this will respond to radiation only within a bandwidth given by its natural linewidth .",
    "if this is small enough , the spectrum if incoming radiation is resolved with this accuracy ; this mirrors the quantum fluctuations of the detector - atom decay .",
    "we also let the radiation reach the detector atoms through a noisy channel , a reservoir which can be eliminated .",
    "thus we present a new approach to time dependent spectra , which does not seem to be directly related to the ones used earlier .",

    "these expectation values are averages over the degrees of freedom of the system , so in practise the spectrum is calculated from two - time system expectation values . in the calculation of the spectrum ,",

    "the energy levels are split and the spectrum has got an eight peak structure , which can be understood as follows : because of the strong lasers all three energy levels are split into sublevels . at low intensity",
    "we have observed two spectral components , at higher driving fields each one is seen to split into four subcomponents .",
    "the frequencies are different for all four transitions .",

    "this is clearly a limitation .",
    "for example , if instead of having a driving laser with constant intensity , we took a laser whose intensity changes in time , we obtain fluorescence light with varying intensity and spectrum . the fluorescence light displays a spectrum but we can not calculate it using the wk - definition .",
