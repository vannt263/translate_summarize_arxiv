    "the first direct images of extrasolar planets were also achieved around nearby , young stars . images of the planetary system around the @xmath130 myr a type dwarf hr 8799 have provided empirical evidence to constrain planetary formation models and the evolution of the atmospheres in young , substellar objects ( marois et al .",

    "the previous stellar examples are members of the youngest populations of stars in the solar neighborhood ; nearby , young moving groups ( _ nymgs _ , zuckerman and song  2004 , hereafter zs04 ; torres et al .  2008 , hereafter t08 ) .",
    "although moving group members have aged enough ( @xmath110 - 100 myr ) to be dispersed from their formation region , they retain small velocity dispersions and their common galactic motion translates to proper motions toward a convergent point in the plane of the sky ( see jones  1971 ; de bruijne  1999 ; mamajek  2005 ) .    because of their proximity ( members @xmath2100 pc ) and loosely bound nature",
    ", moving groups can be spread over thousands of square degrees on the sky .",
    "known groups include the ab doradus and @xmath0 pictoris moving groups ( @xmath150 - 150 and 10 - 20 myrs old respectively ) , which are the only groups to have substantial numbers of known members in the north .",
    "tracing back the kinematics of the youngest _ nymgs _ , including @xmath0 pic , shows that they may be related to a common star formation event in the sco - cen region ( mamajek , lawson , and feigelson  2000 ; mamajek and feigelson  2001 , fernndez et al .",

    "in contrast , the older ab dor group has kinematics and age similar to the pleiades .",
    "luhman , stauffer , and mamajek ( 2005 ) suggest that ab dor and the pleiades are linked to the same star formation event .",
    "member populations in these groups remain largely incomplete and searches to find the missing members are ongoing ( e.g.  lpine and simon  2009 , hereafter ls09 ; looper et al .  2010a , 2010b ; rice , faherty , and cruz  2010 ; schlieder , lpine , and simon  2010 , hereafter sls10 ; kiss et al .",

    "low - mass members ( m@xmath21.0 m@xmath3 ) remain the most under sampled population because : ( 1 ) the intrinsic luminosity of low - mass stars places them beyond the flux limits of the x - ray and astrometric catalogs that have served as the primary resources for identifying new group members ( see zs04 ; t08 and references therein ) , and ( 2 ) youth diagnostics for the lowest - mass stars lack reliability , this makes the missing stars more difficult to identify from the field ( see schlieder et al .  2012 , hereafter s12 ) .",
    "the low - mass populations of moving groups are key for studies of recent local star formation , disks and exoplanets , and the astrophysics of young , low - mass stars . with a more complete moving group census",

    "2002 , chabrier et al .",
    "2005 , bochanski et al .",
    "studies of this kind could provide insight into the universality of the initial mass function and reveal information about the formation environment of _ nymgs_. since moving groups may represent the endpoint of clustered star formation , they are crucial not only for understanding the recent star formation history near the sun , but the latter stages of cluster evolution and dispersion in general",

    "this velocity is consistent with @xmath0 pic membership .",
    "when the rv is combined with the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( vanleeuwen  2007 ) , the ( _ uvw _ ) velocities of the system match the @xmath0 pic moving group ( see table  [ 6d_data ] ) .",
    "the measured rvs of the primary and secondary are indicative of a circular orbit .",
    "furthermore , the very large velocity variation observed over a @xmath124h period for this system is early evidence of a very tight binary with a short orbital period ( see table  [ sb_data ] ) .",
    "thus , we can not exclude the possibility that the observed strong activity is a result of tidal spin - up in the system and it may not be young .",
    "however , we conclude that the pair are likely new members of @xmath0 pic based on consistent galactic kinematics .",

    "lg11 estimate a photometric distance of 21.9@xmath206.6 pc .",
    "although this estimate is based on unresolved photometry , the true distance to the pair is likely much less than the kinematic estimate of @xmath169 pc from sls12 .",
    "orbital parameters from further rv monitoring will provide more information on this likely young , nearby binary .",
    "it is important to reiterate that our kinematic analyses used the @xmath10 for all candidates .",
    "this distance is an estimate assuming group membership .",
    "we have verified that these distances are consistent with group cluster sequences in color - magnitude diagrams ( see sls12 ) and consistent with models at the ages of the groups . for",
    "most proposed new members , photometric or spectroscopic distance estimates are available in the literature , but have varying levels of uncertainty ( see  [ north_lnm ] ) . since the ( _ uvwxyz _ )",
    "calculations are directly dependent on stellar distance , trigonometric parallax measurements from ongoing programs will determine whether or not _ lnm",
    "_ kinematics are truly consistent with group membership .",
    "in sls12 we defined two types of candidate based on their ( _ v - k@xmath16 _ ) colors .",
    "we designated candidates with ( _ v - k@xmath16_)@xmath55.0 candidates with reliable youth ( _ cwrys _ ) , and candidates with ( _ v - k@xmath16_)@xmath345.0 , candidates with ambiguous youth ( _ cways _ ) .",
    "these designation were designed to reflect the observed and modeled steep transition in m dwarf activity ( h@xmath24 ) lifetimes at approximately m4 spty ( see w11 , rm12 ) .",
    "stars earlier than m4 are active only when young and stars at later types have increasing activity lifetimes , up to @xmath18 gyr for the latest m s .",
    "thus , the activity used as the primary indicator of youth in the sls12 list has varying levels of reliability depending on candidate spectral type . here",
    "we discuss the implications of this and other age diagnostics on our proposed members .",
    "our activity based youth selection is modeled after the methods of shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "they estimate that x - ray and uv activity consistent with other , young late - type stars places an upper limit of @xmath1300 myr on the age of an m dwarf .",
    "this limit is more reliable for the stars that qualify as _ cwrys _ ; all but four of the proposed new members .",
    "we can place an age constraint of @xmath14100 myr on two of the _ cway _ new members , pyc j05019 + 0108 and pyc j21376 + 0137 , based on weak na 8200    doublets ( see s12 ) .",
    "other searches for new _ nymg _ members have used the ew of the li feature at 6708    as a requirement for membership . for example , shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) used li ew as cut in their search for new , low - mass members of moving groups .",
    "they found fewer new , m dwarf members than anticipated and proposed that li depletion may be too strict a requirement for membership .",
    "li depletion , like activity , has been shown both empirically and theoretically to be unreliable when estimating low - mass star ages ( see yee and jensen  2010 , baraffe and chabrier  2010 ) . furthermore , for the case of the older ab doradus moving group , most m dwarfs will surely have depleted their lithium ( see mentuch et al .",
    "2008 )    thus , the stars we propose as likely new members of the @xmath0 pic and ab dor groups are pre - main sequence , but whether their ages meet the strict criteria imposed by higher mass group members is difficult to determine at this time .",
    "ongoing spectroscopic follow - up to investigate li depletion and gravity sensitive spectral features must be combined with existing measurements of photometry , activity , and rotation to build an overarching view of youth on a star by star basis .",
    "the stars we are trying to identify as new moving group members are exactly those stars that elude accurate and reliable age dating . therefore , the nearby , young m dwarfs presented here are critical to lay the groundwork for new , more reliable methods of age dating low - mass stars .",
    "we present rv follow - up of 27 young , late - type systems in the list of northern @xmath0 pic and ab dor moving group candidates from sls12 . from high resolution",
    "near - ir spectra we identify 15 stellar systems having rvs consistent with those predicted for moving group membership .",
    "kinematic analysis of these stars shows that all are consistent with the ( _ uvw _ ) velocity distributions of their respective moving group . in ( _ xyz",
    "_ ) distance space , several of these systems have larger _ z _ distances than previously observed for group members . however , they occupy a region of the sky where members of the @xmath0 pic and ab dor groups were not previously known .",
    "we therefore designate all rv match candidates as likely new moving group members ; eleven stars in the @xmath0 pictoris moving group and eleven in the ab doradus moving group .",
    "details on two new spectroscopic binaries are also presented .",
    "one of the binaries , hip 47133ab , is determined to be a likely new member of the @xmath0 pic group .",
    "the other , pyc 22187ab , is rejected as a @xmath0 pic member on the basis of an inconsistent center - of - mass velocity .",
    "these two systems provide the opportunity to measure orbital parameters of nearby , active m dwarfs , yielding component mass estimates , for direct comparison to evolution models .    in total",
    ", our search technique and follow - up has thus far proposed 22 likely members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group and 22 likely members of the ab doradus moving group ( ls09 , sls10 , sls12 , this work ) .",
    "all of these proposed members are later than spty k2 , the majority of them being m dwarfs .",
    "our latest identifications include 12 in binary systems .",
    "if these additions to the proposed membership lists of @xmath0 pic and ab dor are determined to be bona - fide members with further follow - up , we will have nearly doubled the under sampled , low - mass populations in both groups .",
    "this work has contributed to the known census of nearby , pre - main - sequence stars and provided excellent targets for disk , exoplanet , and brown dwarf direct imaging studies .",
    "the proposed members also provide well characterized targets for studies of astrophysics in low - mass stars across a range of masses and ages .",
    "we anticipate that continued follow - up of the sls12 list , and the efforts of others listed in ",
    "[ intro ] , will provide enough low - mass members to begin concentrated studies of the mass functions and multiplicity fractions of the @xmath0 pic and ab dor groups .",
