    "in a superconducting wire , the requirement of current conservation leads to a constraint , @xmath0 , relating the amplitude @xmath1 and the phase @xmath2 of the superconducting order parameter @xmath3 .",
    "when the amplitude goes to zero , the phase is allowed to have rapid changes ( i.e. , the slips ) by @xmath4 .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the phase slip  tinkham96,bezryadin13,arutyunovgolubevzaikin08physrep . for a long time , achieving coherent quantum phase slips has been an interesting but challenging topic .",
    "traditional methods  @xcite rely on the detection of phase - slip changes in resistance measurements of superconducting wires .",
    "however , one can not fully reveal the quantum nature of the phase - slip process  @xcite because phase slips can also be activated by thermodynamic fluctuations that contribute to the residual resistance of superconducting wires  @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated method for detecting coherent quantum phase slips is to engineer a device known as a quantum phase - slip junction  @xcite .",
    "this phase - slip junction can play the role of a josephson junction  likharev86 in a superconducting flux qubit to form a new kind of qubit known as the phase - slip flux qubit  @xcite . compared with conventional superconducting qubits for quantum information processing  younori05phystod - younori11nature , clarkewilhelm08nature , devoretschoelkopf13science ,",
    "this phase - slip qubit is insensitive to the charge noise .",
    "moreover , similar to josephson junctions for accurate standards of voltage  @xcite , the flux - charge duality  @xcite may make this phase - slip qubit a promising device for providing quantum current standard  @xcite . in recent experiments , highly disordered indium oxide ( @xmath5 ) and nibium nitride ( @xmath6 ) nanowires",
    "were utilized to achieve the phase - slip flux qubit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a single - charge transistor based on quantum phase slips was realized  @xcite , which is dual to dc squid and can be operated as an electrometer .",
    "these experiments represent an important step towards the applications of phase - slip circuits in quantum information processing and quantum metrology .",
    "physically , achieving robust coherent quantum phase slips is still an experimental challenge .",
    "the major difficulty comes from quasiparticle dissipations in nanowires or vortex cores which make the phase - slip rate imperceptible .",
    "these dissipations can be suppressed in a highly disordered superconductor near the superconductor - insulator transition , where electrons are localized and quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are prominent .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations are still weak in disordered bulk superconductors , but they can become significantly strong in some disordered nanowires where the localization length is comparable to the coherence length .",
    "it was shown that the phase - slip rate can be increased by raising the disorders in the superconducting nanowires  @xcite , but this is limited since too many disorders in the nanowires can yield strong coulomb interactions and then destroy the superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the phase - slip rate can be increased by using a longer nanowire  @xcite , but this is also limited because the quantum fluctuations needed for the emergence of the phase slips become weakened and even disappeared when increasing the length of the nanowire ( e.g. , the @xmath7 nanowire can be as long as @xmath8 nm  @xcite for keeping the needed quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore , an alternative method to enhance the phase - slip rate is strongly desired . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use multiple nanowire junctions to enhance the quantum phase slips in a phase - slip flux qubit .",
    "this is particularly important when a single junction exhibits only weak phase slips , because such multiple junctions can collectively give rise to a required large phase - slip rate to demonstrate appreciable quantum phase slips . in this phase - slip qubit , each superconducting island separated by two adjoining phase - slip junctions is also biased by a gate voltage , so as to achieve a tunable phase - slip rate .",
    "moreover , we propose to couple two multi - junction phase - slip flux qubits via the mutual inductance between them .",
    "these two inductively coupled phase - slip flux qubits are dual to two charge qubits coupled via a mutual capacitance .",
    "our proposed multi - junction setup has distinct advantages over a single phase - slip junction , because it can achieve a large effective phase - slip rate to demonstrate appreciable phase slips and make more materials ( including those with weak phase slips ) usable in designing superconducting quantum circuits .",

    ", the hamiltonian of the multi - junction phase - slip flux qubit has the same form as the single - junction phase - slip flux qubit  @xcite : @xmath32but the inductive energy is different and the phase - slip rate is replaced by an effective one ( see appendix [ sec : append_qubit ] ) : @xmath33@xmath34where the fluxoid states @xmath35 are the eigenstates of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the reduced externally - applied flux of the loop .",

    "in addition to the suppression of the flux - noise effect on the qubit , the most important advantage of using multiple phase - slip junctions is the significant increase of the phase - slip rate . to implement a phase - slip flux qubit ,",
    "the phase - slip rate should have a large value to achieve appreciable quantum tunneling between fluxoid states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    for a single junction ,",

    "this requires using an disordered material ( i.e. , small @xmath64 ) for the junction .",
    "however , the increase of the phase - slip rate by raising the disorders in the junction is limited because too many disorders in the material can lead to strong coulomb interactions and thus destroy the superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can increase the phase - slip rate @xmath44 by using a longer junction [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnelingrate ] ) ] . however , this is also limited because the quantum fluctuations needed for the emergence of the phase slips become weakened and even disappeared as the junction becomes significantly longer .",
    "for example , the length of the junction can only be as long as @xmath65 nm for a @xmath7 nanowire  @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratelimit ] ) , instead of using a single junction , we can use multiple phase - slip junctions to achieve a large effective phase - slip rate @xmath47 , although each junction may have a small phase - slip rate @xmath44 but both the disorders and the length are within the allowed range for the phase slips to occur .",
    "indeed , a single junction may not exhibit appreciable phase slips when its phase - slip rate is small , but our result reveals that multiple junctions can collectively do .",
