    "about 15% - 20% of quasars show broad uv absorption lines ( loosely defined as absorbing gas that is blue shifted at least 5,000 km / s relative to the qso rest frame and displaying a spread in velocity of at least 2,000 km / s ) @xcite .",
    "the implication is that large volumes of gas are expelled as a byproduct of accretion onto the the central supermassive black hole .",
    "understanding the details of this ejection mechanism is a crucial step towards understanding the physics of the central engine of quasars .",
    "although evolutionary processes might be related to bal outflows , it is widely believed that all radio quiet quasars have bal flows , but the designation of a quasar as a balqso depends on whether the line of sight intersects the solid angle subtended by the outflow .",
    "the standard model of quasars is one of a hot accretion flow onto a black hole and a surrounding torus of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the bal outflow can be an equatorial wind driven from the luminous disk that is viewed at low latitudes , just above the molecular gas , @xcite , or a bipolar flow launched from the inner regions of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the most general feature of 3-d simulations of accretion flows onto black holes is huge ejections of gas from the central vortex of the accretion flow along the polar axis which rivals the accreted mass flux for rapidly spinning black holes @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of profound theoretical interest to look for evidence of these endemic polar ejecta .",
    "balqsos are so distant that direct imaging of the bal region is beyond the resolution of current optical telescopes .",
    "thus , much of the discussion of bal geometry is based on deductive reasoning . a novel idea for finding the orientation of balqsos",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "they used radio variability information to bound the size of the the radio emitting gas then deduced that the radio emission must be viewed close to the polar axis and emanate from a relativistic jet , thereby avoiding the well known inverse compton catastrophe .",
    "they found balqsos that satisfy these conditions in sdss dr3 .",
    "we expand their methods to sdss dr5 and apply these results to the physics of the bal wind launching mechanism .",
    "equation ( 5 ) of @xcite is not well defined since it is unclear what frame of reference is used to evaluate the quantities contained within . apparently , this gave rise to estimates that are @xmath2 larger than what we find in equation ( 2.4 ) , below .",
    "in this section , we derive a formula for @xmath0 .",
    "physically , it is @xmath0 evaluated in the cosmological frame of reference of the quasar , @xmath3 , that is relevant for assessing the `` inverse compton catastrophe . ''",
    "we want to express this in terms of observable quantities at earth designated by the subscript `` o. '' first of all , the brightness temperature is the equivalent blackbody temperature of the radiation assuming one is in the planck regime , @xmath4 . consider a source in which the monochromatic intensity has increased by an amount @xmath5 in a time @xmath6 . the brightness temperature associated with the change in luminosity is @xmath7 from the monochromatic version of liouville s theorem , @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 , is the flux density observed at earth .",
    "the solid angle subtended by the source , @xmath10 , is bounded by the causality requirement that the source could not have expanded more rapidly than the speed of light during a time , @xmath6 , @xcite , @xmath11 where the angular diameter distance is @xmath12 . in a a cosmology with @xmath13=70 km",
    "/ s / mpc , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we can use the expression for @xmath12 given by @xcite , that is accurate to @xmath16 relative error , along with ( 2.1 ) -(2.3 ) to find :    @xmath17^{-0.125}\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the change in flux density in mjy measured at earth at frequency @xmath19 during the time interval @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath21 , the inverse compton catastrophe occurs .",
    "most of the electron energy is radiated in the inverse compton regime . the radio synchrotron spectrum from the jet",
    "is diminished in intensity to unobservable levels @xcite . in order to explain the observed radio synchrotron jet in such sources , doppler boosting",
    "is customarily invoked to resolve the paradox .",
    "recall that for an unresolved source the observed flux density , @xmath9 , is doppler enhanced relative to the intrinsic flux density , @xmath22 , where the doppler factor , @xmath23 is given in terms of @xmath24 , the lorentz factor of the outflow ; @xmath25 , the three velocity of the outflow ; and @xmath26 , is the spectral index , @xmath27 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , doppler beaming can cause @xmath3 to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath28 in ( 2.4 ) . assuming a flat spectral index for the unresolved relativistic jet , we choose @xmath29 .",
    "this allows us to find a minimum doppler factor that avoids the inverse compton catastrophe , @xmath30=[(t_{b})_{q}/ ( 10^{12}\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\mathrm{k})]^{0.333}$ ] .",
    "if the jet plasma propagates with @xmath31 $ ] then the intrinsic @xmath0 in the frame of reference of the jet plasma is sufficiently low that there is no inverse compton catastrophe",

    "table 1 is a list of balqsos in which the radio variability requires that the jet is propagating well within @xmath36 to the line of sight in order for the jet plasma to satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "since rather small variations of flux density create these conditions we must first prove that the sources are truly variable .",
    "we choose the condition for variability to be @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the peak flux density at 1.4 ghz measured by the first and nvss surveys , respectively , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the first and nvss peak flux uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the beam for the nvss survey is considerably larger than first ( @xmath43 versus @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , a compact source @xmath45 ( like a compact radio core which is the putative site of variable activity ) should be detected with equal sensitivity if it exceeds the flux limit of the samples .",
    "the nvss beam should pick up more extended flux than first .",
    "variable balqso fields in nvss with confusion from nearby sources were omitted from table 1 .",
    "thus , a first peak flux density larger than an nvss peak flux density by @xmath46 ( * hence the plus sign on the rhs of eqn . ( 3.1 ) * ) is true variability and not an artifact of the different beam sizes .",
    "one improvement from @xcite is that we used the peak nvss flux density as opposed to the integrated nvss flux density .",
    "this is preferred for the comparison described in ( 3.1 ) , since the variable radio flux is most likely coming from sub - arcsecond regions of the jet and this choice is less sensitive to low surface brightness noise that can be picked up in the integrated flux @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to assess the significance of the @xmath47 results in table 1 . in order to clarify the statistics",
    ", we must delineate the super sample from which the sources in table 1 are drawn .",
    "the potential variable balqsos in dr5 that can be detected by equation ( 3.1 ) require two conditions .",

    "the nvss survey has a peak flux limit of 2.5 mjy in general , but occasionally as low as 2.2 mjy and a minimum measurement uncertainty of @xmath50 mjy @xcite .",

    "there are 116 balqsos that satisfy these criteria and they form the master sample . eqn . ( 3.1 ) is a one sided probability , so if the errors are gaussian distributed as in @xcite then there is less than a 20% chance of expecting a variable balqso from this sample of 116 .",

    "the accretion disk coronal x - rays are screened from the bal wind by the dense base of the jet which provides hydrogen column densities of @xmath71 .",
