    "this paper deals with moving solitons of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "the earliest applications of the cubic dnls equation were to the self - trapping of electrons in lattices ( the polaron problem ) and energy transfer in biological chains ( davydov solitons )  see the reviews @xcite for references .",
    "relatedly , the equation arises in the description of small - amplitude breathers in frenkel - kontorova chains with weak coupling @xcite . in optics",
    "the equation describes light - pulse propagation in nonlinear waveguide arrays in the tight - binding limit @xcite .",
    "most recently the dnls equation has been used to model bose - einstein condensates in optically induced lattices @xcite .",
    "the question of the existence of moving solitons in the dnls equation has been the subject of debate for some time @xcite .",
    "recently , gmez - gardees , flora , falo , peyrard and bishop @xcite have demonstrated that the stationary motion of pulses in the cubic one - site dnls ( the ` standard ' dnls ) is only possible over an oscillatory background consisting of a superposition of plane waves .",
    "this result was obtained by numerical continuation of the moving ablowitz - ladik breather with two commensurate time scales . in our present paper ,",
    "we study the travelling discrete solitons analytically and independently of any reference models .",
    "consistently with the conclusions of @xcite , we will show that solitons can not freely move in the cubic dnls equation ; they emit radiation , decelerate and eventually become pinned by the lattice .",
    "we shall show , however , that this radiation is exponentially small in the soliton s amplitude , so that broad , small - amplitude pulses are highly mobile and are for all practical purposes indistinguishable from freely moving solitons .    in the context of optical waveguide arrays ",
    "important not only in themselves but also as a first step to understanding more complicated optical systems such as photonic crystals ",
    "interest among experimentalists @xcite has recently shifted away from media with pure - kerr nonlinearity ( which gives rise to a cubic term in the dnls equation ) and towards photorefractive media , which exhibit a saturable nonlinearity @xcite . in practice",
    "such arrays may be optically induced in a photorefractive material @xcite or fabricated permanently ",
    "see @xcite , for example .",
    "the study of solitons in _ continuous _ optical systems with saturable nonlinearitites has a long history ; interesting phenomena here include bistability @xcite , fusion @xcite and radiation effects @xcite which do not arise in the cubic equation . as for the _ discrete _ case ,",
    "the work of khare , rasmussen , samuelsen and saxena @xcite suggests that the saturable one - site dnls may be _ exceptional _ in the sense of ref.@xcite ; that is , despite not being a translation invariant system , it supports translationally invariant stationary solitons .",
    "this property is usually seen as a prerequisite for undamped motion in discrete equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and indeed , the numerical experiments of vicencio and johansson @xcite have revealed that soliton mobility is enhanced in the saturable dnls equation .",
    "the dnls equation with a saturable nonlinearity is the second object of our analysis here ; our conclusions will turn out to be in agreement with the numerical observations of ref.@xcite .",
    "we will show that for nonlinearities which saturate at a low enough intensity , solitons can _ slide_that is , move without radiative deceleration  at certain isolated velocities . these ` sliding ' solitons are examples of embedded solitons .",
    "the usual saturable dnls equation is the discrete form of the vinetskii - kukhtarev model @xcite : @xmath0 in order to encompass both cubic and saturable nonlinearities in a single model , we shall instead consider the equation @xmath1 obtained from eq . by making the transformation @xmath2 and letting @xmath3 . in the form above",
    ", @xmath4 represents the saturation threshold of the medium @xcite , which tends to infinity as one approaches the pure kerr ( cubic ) case of @xmath5 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath6 , the lower is the intensity at which the nonlinearity saturates .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way . in section [ section2 ] , we construct a small - amplitude , broad travelling pulse as an asymptotic series in powers of @xmath7 , its amplitude . the velocity and frequency of this soliton are obtained as explicit functions of @xmath7 and its carrier - wave wavenumber . then in section [ section3 ] , the main section of this paper , we derive an expression for the soliton s radiation tails and measure their amplitude using the method of asymptotics beyond all orders . in section [ section4 ] ,",
    "we investigate the influence of this exponentially weak radiation on the soliton s amplitude and speed .",
    "finally , in section [ section5 ] , we summarise our work and make comparisons with some earlier results .",
    "we begin by seeking solutions of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath7 is a parameter . by analogy with the soliton of the continuous nls , we expect the discrete soliton to be uniquely characterised by two parameters  e.g .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath10while the other two ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are expected to be expressible through @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "substituting the ansatz , into gives a differential advance - delay equation @xmath13 this can be written as an ordinary differential equation of an infinite order : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "from now on we assume that @xmath7 is small .",
    "our aim in this section is to find an approximate solution to eq.and hence eq.with @xmath16 .",
    "( that is , we are looking for small , broad pulses which modulate a periodic carrier wave . ) to this end , we expand @xmath17 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as power series in @xmath7 :    [ expansions ] @xmath18    ( we are not expanding @xmath10 as we consider it , along with @xmath7 , as one of the two independent parameters characterising our solution . ) substituting these expansions into eq . gives a hierarchy of equations to be satisfied at each power of @xmath7 by choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 properly .",
    "in nonlinear oscillations , this perturbation procedure is known as lindstedt s method @xcite .    at the order @xmath21",
    "we obtain @xmath22 while the order @xmath23 gives @xmath24 these two relations correspond to the dispersion of linear waves . at the power @xmath25",
    "we obtain the following nonlinear equation for @xmath26 : @xmath27 this is the stationary form of the nls equation , which has the homoclinic solution @xmath28 with @xmath29 returning to the original variable @xmath17 , we note that the amplitude @xmath30 can always be absorbed into @xmath7 , the parameter in eq.([eps_wid ] ) and in front of @xmath26 in ( [ exp_psi ] ) .",
    "that is , there is no loss of generality in setting @xmath31 and letting @xmath7 describe the amplitude ( and inverse width ) of the pulse instead .",
    "this allows us to set @xmath32    note that the coefficients in eq .",
    "are periodic functions of the parameter @xmath10 with period @xmath33 ; therefore it is sufficient to consider @xmath10 in the interval @xmath34 .",
    "also , is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; hence it is sufficient to consider positive @xmath10 only .",
    "finally , our perturbative solution does not exist if @xmath38 is negative .",
    "thus , from now on we shall assume that @xmath39 .      at the order @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , we arrive at the following equations for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath42 :    [ genlinear ] @xmath43    where",

    "these deformations are trivial , and hence we can safely discard the homogeneous solutions at each order of @xmath7 .    as @xmath26 s real part is even and its imaginary part is odd ( zero ) , @xmath50 s real and imaginary parts are also even and odd , respectively .",
    "the same holds , by induction , to all orders of the perturbation theory .",

    "equations coincide with the expressions @xcite of the ablowitz - ladik soliton s velocity and frequency in terms of its amplitude and wavenumber .",
    "the difference between the two sets of answers is in that eqs pertain to small - amplitude solitons only , whereas ablowitz and ladik s formulas are valid for arbitrarily large amplitudes .",
    "note , also , that the velocity and frequency do not depend on the saturation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast to the stationary ( @xmath88 ) soliton of eqs and obtained by khare , rasmussen , samuelsen and saxena @xcite .",
    "the soliton of ref.@xcite has its amplitude and frequency uniquely determined by @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath83 , the series reduces to @xmath89 . the convergence of the series @xmath90 for all @xmath49 would imply , in particular , the convergence of the series @xmath91",
    "therefore , if the series converged , the solution @xmath48 would be decaying to zero as @xmath83 . however , although we have shown that the series @xmath90 is asymptotic to all orders , it does not have to be convergent .",
    "for instance , it is easy to see that the series can not converge for @xmath92 and any @xmath7 ; since the advance - delay equation is translation invariant , this would imply that we have constructed a family of stationary solitons with an arbitrary position relative to the lattice .",
    "this , in turn , would contradict the well established fact that the ` standard ' cubic dnls solitons can only be centered on a site or midway between two adjacent sites @xcite ( that is , that the ` standard ' discretisation of the cubic nls is not exceptional @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the perturbative solution satisfies @xmath93 as @xmath62 only for some special choices of @xmath12 , @xmath7 and @xmath6",

    "these harmonic waves can form a radiation background over which the soliton propagates ( as suggested by the numerics of @xcite and the analysis of a similar problem for the @xmath100 kinks in @xcite ) .",
    "being nonanalytic in @xmath7 , such backgrounds can not be captured by any order of the perturbation expansion .",
    "as we will show below , not only the wavenumbers but also the amplitudes of the harmonic waves are nonanalytic in @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon was first encountered in the context of the breather of the continuous @xmath100 model , where eleonskii , kulagin , novozhilova , and silin @xcite suggested that the radiation from the breather could be exponentially weak .",
    "segur and kruskal @xcite then developed the method of ` asymptotics beyond all orders ' to demonstrate that , in the limit @xmath101 , such radiation does exist .",
    "we will use segur and kruskal s method to measure the magnitude of the radiation background of the travelling discrete soliton .",
    "qualitatively , the fact that the radiation is not excited at any order of the perturbation expansion is explained by the fact that the soliton exists on the long length scale @xmath49 , whereas the radiation has the shorter scale @xmath102 . to all orders , the two are uncoupled .    using the relations , we can rewrite as @xmath103 the left hand side is plotted in fig.[nicedisprelfig ] .",

    "physically , one such solution represents a travelling soliton slowing down and attenuating as the cherenkov radiation left in its wake carries momentum and energy away from its core .    substituting into eq . , gives @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",

    "this means that the soliton stops moving  and stops decaying at the same time .    for @xmath10",
    "smaller than @xmath448 , the vector field is undefined and we can not use it to find out what happens to the soliton after @xmath10 has reached @xmath448 .",
    "the reason for this is that the soliton stops radiating at the wavenumber @xmath404 as @xmath10 drops below @xmath448 .",
    "in fact our analysis becomes invalid as soon as @xmath10 becomes @xmath461i.e .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath12 , @xmath472 , define the _ sliding _ velocities of the soliton",

    "one such velocity is shown by the dashed line in fig.[phaseplane](b ) .",
    "the fixed points @xmath473 are semistable ; for @xmath10 above @xmath474 , the flow is towards the line @xmath471 but when @xmath10 is below @xmath474 , the flow is directed away from this straight line [ see fig.[phaseplane](b ) ] .",
    "since both @xmath456 and @xmath454 are negative , the soliton s velocity @xmath475 will generally be decreasing  until it hits the nearest underlying sliding velocity @xmath476 and locks on to it .",
    "the ensuing sliding motion will be unstable ; a small perturbation will be sufficient to take the soliton out of the sliding regime after which it will resume its radiative deceleration .",
    "however , since @xmath454 is proportional to the _ square _ of the stokes constant and not to @xmath374 itself , small perturbations @xmath477 will be growing linearly , not exponentially , in @xmath478 . as a result",
    ", the soliton may spend a fairly long time sliding at the velocity @xmath476 .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to classify this sliding motion as _",
    "we conclude that the soliton becomes pinned ( i.e.  @xmath479 and so @xmath480 ) before it has decayed fully ( i.e.  before the amplitude @xmath7 has decreased to zero ) .",
    "the exponential dependence of @xmath481 and @xmath482 on @xmath483 implies that tall , narrow pulses will be pinned very quickly while short , broad ones will travel for a very long time before they have slowed appreciably .",
    "next , if @xmath6 is such that there is one or more sliding velocity available in the system , and if the soliton is initially moving faster than some of these , its deceleration will be interrupted by long periods of undamped motion at the corresponding sliding velocities .     the soliton s decay rate as a function of its velocity , for fixed @xmath484 .",
    "( here @xmath375 . ) in the inset , the same curve is replotted using a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis . ]",
    "it is worth reemphasising here that if the amplitude @xmath7 is small , then even if the soliton is _ not _ sliding , its deceleration will be so slow that it will spend an exponentially long time travelling with virtually unchanged amplitude and speed . the deceleration rate @xmath485 is shown in fig.[decayrate ] , as a function of the soliton s velocity @xmath12 , for fixed amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "note that the decay rate drops , exponentially , as the velocity is decreased ; this drop is due to the exponential factor @xmath486 in eq .. as the velocity @xmath12 ( and hence the wavenumber @xmath10 ) decreases , the root @xmath487 grows towards the limit value of approximately @xmath33 ( see fig.[nicedisprelfig ] ) .",
    "this variation in @xmath404 is amplified by the division by small @xmath7 and exponentiation in @xmath486 .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed the moving discrete soliton of the saturable nls equation [ and hence ] as an asymptotic expansion in powers of its amplitude .",
    "the saturable nonlinearity includes the cubic nls as a particular case ( for which @xmath375 ) .",
    "our perturbation procedure is a variant of the lindstedt ",
    "poincar technique where corrections to the parameters of the solution are calculated along with the calculation of the solution itself .",
    "although the resulting asymptotic series for the soliton is generally not convergent , the associated expansions for its frequency and velocity sum up to exact explicit expressions .    from the divergence of the asymptotic series it follows , in particular , that the travelling discrete soliton does not decay to zero at least at one of the two infinities . instead , the soliton approaches , as @xmath488 or @xmath83 , an oscillatory resonant background where the amplitudes @xmath144 of its constituent harmonic waves lie beyond all orders of @xmath7",
    "for the soliton moving with a positive velocity and approaching zero as @xmath488 , the oscillatory background at the left infinity represents the cherenkov radiation left in the soliton s wake . to evaluate the amplitudes of the harmonic waves arising as @xmath83",
    ", we have continued the radiating soliton into the complex plane , where it exhibits singularities .",
    "we then matched the asymptotic expansion of the background near the lowest singularity on the imaginary @xmath49 axis to the far - field asymptotic expansion of the background solution of the ` inner ' equation ",
    "i.e.  of the advance - delay equation ` zoomed in ' on this singularity .",
    "the asymptotic expansions here are in inverse powers of the zoomed variable , @xmath149 .",
    "the amplitudes of the radiation waves were found to be exponentially small in @xmath7 , with the pre - exponential factors ( the so - called stokes constants ) being dependent only on the soliton s carrier - wave wavenumber . representing solutions to the inner equation as borel sums of their asymptotic expansions ,",
    "the stokes constants can be related to the expansion coefficients ; we have calculated these coefficients numerically , using algebraic recurrence relations .",
    "the upshot of the calculation of the leading stokes constant @xmath223 is that in the case of the cubic nonlinearity ( i.e.  for @xmath375 ) , @xmath374 does not vanish for any @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the cubic discrete soliton can not ` slide ' ",
    "i.e.  can not move without radiative friction .",
    "the saturable solitons , on the other hand , _ can _ slide provided the saturation parameter @xmath6 is large enough .",
    "this is because , for a sufficiently large @xmath6 , the stokes constant @xmath374 is found to have one or more zeros @xmath489 . since the soliton with wavenumber @xmath490 can have no higher - order resonances , those zeros which satisfy @xmath491",
    "do define the wavenumbers at which sliding motion occurs .",
    "for each value of the soliton s amplitude @xmath7 , the formula then gives the sliding velocities @xmath492 .",
    "the calculation of asymptotics beyond all orders is useful not only for determining the sliding velocities . knowing the radiation amplitudes has allowed us to derive a two - dimensional dynamical system for the soliton s parameters .",
    "trajectories of this dynamical system describe the evolution of the soliton travelling at a generic speed .",
    "the evolution turns out to be simple : if @xmath6 is such that the stokes constant @xmath374 does not vanish anywhere in the region @xmath493 , the soliton decelerates , although very slowly .",
    "eventually it becomes pinned to the lattice with a decreased but finite amplitude .",
    "however , if @xmath6 is such that there are sliding velocities in the system , and if the soliton starts its motion with the velocity higher than some of these then , although it will finally become pinned to the lattice , its deceleration will be interrupted by long periods of metastable sliding motion at these isolated velocities .",
    "it is interesting to tie up the above results with our previous work on exceptional discretisations of the @xmath100 model @xcite .",
    "in that case we discovered that for some exceptional models ( in which the stationary soliton possesses an effective translational symmetry ) , sliding velocities , at which the radiation disappears , do exist .",
    "the fact that all these models involve a complicated nonlocal discretisation of the nonlinearity leads one to wonder whether the nonlinearity _ has _ to be discretised nonlocally in order for sliding solitons to exist .",
    "this question is answered  negatively  by our present work which gives a counterexample of a simple , local and physically motivated nonlinearity supporting sliding solitons .",
    "a remaining open issue is whether exceptionality of the system is a prerequisite for the existence of sliding solitary waves .",
    "indeed , we have yet to encounter a nonexceptional discrete system permitting sliding motion .",
    "we conclude this section by placing our results in the context of earlier studies of discrete solitons .    moving solitons in the cubic dnls equation",
    "have previously been studied by ablowitz , musslimani , and biondini @xcite ( among others ) , using a numerical technique based on discrete fourier transforms as well as perturbation expansions for small velocities .",
    "as we have done , these authors suggest that sliding ( radiationless ) solitons may not exist .",
    "they also observe , with the aid of numerical simulations , that strongly localised pulses are pinned quickly to the lattice , while broader ones are more mobile  results which are in agreement with ours .",
    "duncan , eilbeck , feddersen and wattis @xcite have studied the bifurcation of periodic travelling waves from constant solutions in the cubic dnls equation , using numerical path - following techniques .",
    "they find that the paths terminate when the soliton s amplitude reaches a certain limit value , and in the light of our results it seems likely that this is the point at which the radiation becomes large enough to have an effect on the numerics .",
    "solitary waves which decay to constant values at the spatial infinities , despite the fact that the generic asymptotic behaviour in the underlying model is oscillatory , are commonly referred to as embedded solitons .",
    "an example is given by the sliding solitons reported in this paper as well as the sliding kinks of @xcite ; both types of solitary waves propagate without exciting the resonant background oscillations .",
    "embedded solitons have been studied for some time in continuous systems @xcite , but their history in lattice equations is younger .",
    "recently , malomed , gonzlez - prez - sandi , fujioka , espinosa - cern and rodrguez have considered certain lattice equations with next - to - nearest - neighbour couplings and shown ( by means of explicit solutions ) that both stationary @xcite and moving @xcite embedded solitons exist .",
    "stationary embedded solitons in discrete waveguide arrays have also been analysed by yagasaki , champneys and malomed @xcite .    finally , while preparing the revised version of this paper , we learnt that melvin , champneys , kevrekidis , and cuevas have obtained results very similar to ours . using a combination of intuitive arguments and numerical computations , they have found sliding solitons for certain values of the parameters of a saturable dnls model @xcite .",
