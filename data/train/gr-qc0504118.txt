    "the idea of elaborating the foundation of space - time ( or foundation of relativity ) in a spirit analogous with the rather successful foundation of mathematics ( fom ) was initiated by several authors including , e.g. , david hilbert  @xcite or leading contemporary logician harvey friedman  @xcite .",
    "foundation of mathematics has been carried through strictly within the framework of first - order logic ( fol ) , for certain reasons .",
    "the same reasons motivate the effort of keeping the foundation of space - time also inside fol .",
    "one of the reasons is that staying inside fol helps us to avoid tacit assumptions , another reason is that fol has a complete inference system while higher - order logic can not have one by gdel s incompleteness theorem , see e.g. , vnnen  @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is practically equivalent to asking whether is strong enough to `` handle '' ( or treat ) accelerated observers .",
    "we show that there is a mathematical principle called induction ( ) coming from real analysis which needs to be added to in order to handle situations involving relativistic acceleration .",
    "we present an extended version of which is strong enough to handle accelerated clocks , in particular , accelerated observers .",
    "we show that the so - called twin paradox becomes provable in .",
    "it also becomes possible to introduce einstein s equivalence principle for treating gravity as acceleration and proving the gravitational time dilation , i.e.  that gravity `` causes time to run slow '' .",
    "what we are doing here is not unrelated to field s `` science without numbers '' programme and to `` reverse mathematics '' in the sense of harvey friedman and steven simpson .",
    "namely , we systematically ask ourselves which mathematical principles or assumptions ( like , e.g. , ) are really needed for proving certain observational predictions of relativity .",
    "( it was this striving for parsimony in axioms or assumptions which we alluded to when we mentioned , way above , that was `` streamlined '' . )",
    "the interplay between logic and relativity theory goes back to around 1920 and has been playing a non - negligible role in works of researchers like reichenbach , carnap , suppes , ax , szekeres , malament , walker , and of many other contemporaries .",
    "in section  [ ax - s ] we recall the fol axiomatization complete w.r.t .",
    "questions concerning inertial motion .",
    "there we also introduce an extension of ( still inside fol ) capable for handling accelerated clocks and also accelerated observers . in section  [ main - s ]",
    "we formalize the twin paradox in the language of fol .",
    "we formulate theorems  [ thmtwp ] , [ thmeq ] stating that the twin paradox is provable from and the same for related questions for accelerated clocks .",
    "theorems [ thmnoind ] , [ thmmo ] state that is not sufficient for this , more concretely that the induction axiom in is needed . in sections  [ an - s ] , [ proofss ] we prove these theorems",

    "@xcite present a rather convincing general perspective ( and motivation ) for the kind of work reported here .",
    "in this paper we deal with the kinematics of relativity only , i.e.  we deal with motion of _ bodies _ ( or _ test - particles _ ) .",
    "the motivation for our choice of vocabulary ( for special relativity ) is summarized as follows",
    ". we will represent motion as changing spatial location in time .",
    "to do so , we will have reference - frames for coordinatizing events and , for simplicity , we will associate reference - frames with special bodies which we will call _ observers_. we visualize an observer - as - a - body as `` sitting '' in the origin of the space part of its reference - frame , or equivalently , `` living '' on the time - axis of the reference - frame .",
    "we will distinguish _ inertial _ observers from non - inertial ( i.e.  accelerated ) ones .",
    "there will be another special kind of bodies which we will call _",
    "photons_. for coordinatizing events we will use an arbitrary _ ordered field _ in place of the field of the real numbers . thus the elements of this field will be the `` _ quantities _ '' which we will use for marking time and space . allowing arbitrary ordered fields in place of the reals",
    "increases flexibility of our theory and minimizes the amount of our mathematical presuppositions .",
    "e.g. , ax @xcite for further motivation in this direction .",
    "similar remarks apply to our flexibility oriented decisions below , e.g. , keeping the number @xmath0 of space - time dimensions a variable .",
    "using coordinate systems ( or reference - frames ) instead of a single observer independent space - time structure is only a matter of didactical convenience and visualization , furthermore it also helps us in weeding out unnecessary axioms from our theories .",
    "motivated by the above , we now turn to fixing the fol language of our axiom systems .",
    "the first occurrences of concepts used in this work are set by boldface letters to make it easier to find them . throughout this work ,",
    "if - and - only - if is abbreviated to * iff*.    let us fix a natural number @xmath1 for the dimension of the space - time that we are going to axiomatize .",
    "our first - order language contains the following non - logical symbols :    * unary relation symbols @xmath2 ( for * bodies * ) , @xmath3 ( for * observers * ) , @xmath4 ( for * inertial observers * ) , @xmath5 ( for * photons * ) and @xmath6 ( for * quantities * which are going to be elements of a field ) , * binary function symbols @xmath7 ,",
