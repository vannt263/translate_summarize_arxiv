    "it is known that in the standard model ( sm ) the double radiative decays of the @xmath3 mesons , @xmath0 , first arise at the one loop level with the exchange of up - quarks and w - bosons in the loops  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios for the above decays are of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand there is the possibility to enhance the above mentioned decays in extended versions of the sm . in the papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that in supersymmetric versions of the sm one could reach a branching ratio as large as @xmath5 depending on the susy parameters .",
    "this enhancement was achieved mainly due to the exchange of charged scalar higgs particles within the loop .",
    "there exists an analogous possibility in other exotic models as well for the scalar particle exchange inside the loop , which could potentially enhance this process .",
    "for example , the appelquist , chang and dobresku ( acd ) model with only one universal extra dimension @xcite presents us with such an opportunity .",
    "one should note that in the above approach towers of charged higgs particles arise as real objects with certain masses , not as fictitious ( ghost ) fields .",
    "in this letter we aim to calculate the contributions from these real scalars to the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the section  2 some useful information about the acd model , necessary for the calculations , is provided .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the calculation of the pertinent amplitudes . in section  4 , numerical estimates of the branching ratios",
    "are discussed .",
    "in the universal extra dimension ( ued ) scenarios all the fields presented in the sm live in extra dimensions , i.e. they are functions of all space - time coordinates . for bosonic fields",
    "one simply replaces all derivatives and fields in the sm lagrangian by their 5-dimensional counterparts .",
    "these are the @xmath6-and @xmath7-gauge fields as well as the @xmath8-gauge fields from the qcd -sector .",
    "the higgs doublet is chosen to be even under @xmath9 ( @xmath9 is a parity operator in the five dimensional space ) and possesses a zero mode .",
    "note that all zero modes remain massless before the higgs mechanism is applied .",
    "in addition we should note that as a result of the action of the parity operator the fields receive additional masses @xmath10 after dimensional reduction and transition to the four dimensional lagrangians .",
    "in the five dimensional acd model the same procedure for gauge fixing is possible as in the models in which fermions are localized on the 4-dimensional subspace .",
    "with the gauge fixed , one can diagonalize the kinetic terms of the bosons and finally derive expressions for the propagators .",
    "compared to the sm , there are additional kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass terms .",
    "as they are common to all fields , their contributions to the gauge boson mass matrix is proportional to the unity matrix . as a consequence ,",
    "the electroweak angle remains the same for all kk - modes and is the ordinary weinberg angle @xmath11 . because of the kk - contribution to the mass matrix , charged and neutral higgs components with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the number of the kk - mode ) no longer play the role of goldstone bosons .",
    "instead , they mix with @xmath14 and @xmath15 to form , in addition to the goldstone modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , three additional physical states @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is precisely the role of these additional charged physical states to double radiative neutral @xmath20-meson decays that is studied in this paper .",
    "the lagrangian responsible for the interaction of charged scalar kk towers @xmath21 with the ordinary down quarks reads @xmath22 utilizing the following notations @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are elements of the ckm matrix . the mass parameters in eq.(2 )",
    "are defined as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and the masses of up ( down)-quarks @xmath27 in the right - hand - side of eq.(3 ) are zero mode masses and the @xmath28 , @xmath29 stand for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the fermions mixing angles , respectively , @xmath32 the masses for the fermions are calculated as @xmath33 in the phenomenological applications we use the restriction @xmath34 and hence we assume that all the fermionic mixing angles except @xmath35 are equal zero .",
    "the feynman graphs , describing the contributions of scalar physical states to process under consideration , are shown in fig.1 .",
    "-meson decay @xmath0 in the theory with only one extra universal dimension ( the dashed lines in the loops correspond to the charged kk towers @xmath36 , while the solid lines in the loops are for the up - quark kk towers).,width=226 ]    the amplitude for the decay @xmath0 has the form @xmath37 . \\ ] ] this equation is correct after gauge fixing for the final photons which we have chosen as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are photon polarization vectors , respectively .",
    "the condition eq.(7 ) together with energy - momentum conservation leads to @xmath41 where @xmath42 let us write down some useful kinematical relations which are results of eqs.(7,8 ) as well : @xmath43    the total contributions into @xmath44-even ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath44-odd ( @xmath20 ) amplitudes from eq.(6 ) are calculated as sums of the appropriate contributions of the diagrams in fig.1 corresponding to a tower of scalar particle contributions in the acd model with only one extra dimension .",
    "let us note that we used the following formula for the hadronic matrix elements : @xmath46    apart from one particle reducible ( 1pr ) diagrams , one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) ones contribute to the amplitudes , and hence , to their @xmath44-even ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath44-odd ( @xmath20 ) parts .",
    "we should note that each of the 1pi contributions is finite .",
    "let us discuss these contributions in more details",
    ". in the sm only one 1pi diagram ( one with the @xmath47-boson exchange in the loop , when both photons are emitted by virtual up - quarks ) gives the contribution of the order of @xmath48 . in the ref.@xcite",
    "it was observed that diagrams with light quark exchange contribute as @xmath49 , while diagrams containing the heavy quarks are of order of @xmath50 . in the acd model",
    "the contributions of such diagrams are of the order of @xmath50 because the estimate for all kk - tower masses , including the ones exchanged in the loops , in our case are @xmath51gev .",
    "likewise discussions show that all the 1pi diagrams existing in the acd model also are of order @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the leading 1pi diagrams are negligible and we do not consider them .",
    "the total contributions to the @xmath52 decay amplitudes are : @xmath53\\frac12 f_2(x_i ) \\bigr{\\ } } , \\nonumber \\\\ b&=&2b\\frac{m_b}{m_{s,(d)}}\\bigl{\\ { } \\frac{n}{rm_w}m^{(i)}_3m_{i(n)}c_{i(n)}f_1(x_i)+ \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bigl [ ( m_3^{(i)})^2 + \\frac{n^2}{r^2m^2_w}m_bm_{s(d)}c^2_{i(n)}\\bigr]\\frac12 f_2(x_i ) \\bigr{\\ } } , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 as it is obvious from fig.1 , the correct calculation assumes the inclusion of the crossed diagrams ( not shown on fig.1 ) . in the kinematics we use ,",
    "cf . eqs.(7 - 10 ) , this leads to a factor 2 for all amplitudes , except for the one given by diagram 11 .",
    "however , diagram 11 belongs to the class of 1pi diagrams . as it was stated above",
    ", one particle irreducible diagrams does not give leading contributions into process and therefore their contributions ( @xmath50 ) are negligible comparing with that of the 1pr diagrams .",
    "let us note that we restricted ourselves by calculating the leading order terms of @xmath49 from the up - quark kk - towers . in this approximation",
    "it turns out that the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 towers have equal contributions .",
    "therefore , the expressions for the amplitudes have a simpler form than before : @xmath58 furthermore , it is easy to obtain from eq.(6 ) the expression for the @xmath52 decay partial width : @xmath59 .    \\ ] ] now we are in the position to compare the acd contribution to the decay with that of the sm .",
    "namely , let us consider the ratio : @xmath60 where @xmath61 rough numerical estimates of eq.(17 ) show that in case of @xmath62-meson decay we can get a difference from sm - result as much as @xmath63 .",
    "the ued contribution to the @xmath64 is @xmath65 of the sm estimate and increases the overal contribution ( sm+ued ) by @xmath65 .",
    "the same difference for the case of @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "the theoretical estimates of double radiative @xmath20-decays in the framework of the standard model , @xmath68 and @xmath69 along with the upper experimental limits [ 11 ] allows us to hope that in the not to far future these decays will be observed ( say , by the babar or belle collaborations or at the cern b - physics facility ) .",
    "we thus hope that not too much time will pass until the differences of @xmath70 will be accessible for experimental analysis .",
