    "in this paper we presented an x - ray study of the spectral and timing properties of during quiescence , using a new _ xmm  newton _ observation obtained on 2009 august 30 .",
    "we also made use of this new observation to improve the modeling of the outburst and the spin period evolution of the source since it was first detected in 2008 aug 22 .",
    "to do this we used all the available data collected up to date from _ xmm  newton _ , _",
    "swift_-xrt , _ rxte _ , _ chandra _ , and _ suzaku_.    during quiescence both the pulse shape and the pulsed fraction change as a function of energy .",
    "the 0.312 kev pulse profile consists mainly of a single peak showing no very prominent features . at lower energies",
    "the pulse profile presents two peaks that seem to get dissolved into one as the energy increases .",
    "moreover , the pulsed fraction increases at any given energy range as the outburst evolves ( see fig .",
    "the spectrum was well fit by an absorbed bb + pl model .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this model are @xmath5=0.85(3)@xmath26@xmath7 , kt=0.52@xmath270.02kev , and @xmath28=3.87@xmath270.13 .",
    "the source shows an absorbed flux @xmath075 times lower than that measured during the 2008 outburst , and a rather soft spectrum , with the same value of the blackbody temperature observed with _ rosat _ back in 1992 and with _ swift_-xrt in 2009 - 2010 .",
    "the 0.12.4 kev observed flux was f@xmath291.8@xmath3010@xmath31erg @xmath7 s@xmath10 , in line with that observed by rosat before the outburst .",
    "all magnetar outbursts detected so far were characterized by the presence of a hot spot , which cools down until quiescence is reached ; the peak luminosity is of the order of a @xmath32(see * ? ? ?",
    "magnetar outbursts are believed to be due to a sudden crustal crack consequence of their unstable magnetic field configuration , when the twisted magnetic field in its constant movement toward a stable / quiet assessment , stresses the crust until its breaking point .",
    "the large amount of energy that is released in this event is expected to be of the order of @xmath33 ergs .",
    "part of this energy will heat the crust ( explaining the sudden increase of the surface temperature soon after the outburst onset ) , part of it will be spent in accelerating particles in the magnetosphere ( explaining the hardening of the spectral shape ) , and a large fraction will be released in neutrinos . the limiting luminosity is a consequence of the neutrino emission that regulates the release of most of the energy dumped in the crust as soon as a temperature reaches here a value of 4@xmath3010@xmath34 k @xcite . the total energy released by s outburst in the 0.510kev band",
    "is @xmath35 ergs , in line with what expected for a typical large scale crustal event . on the other hand ,",
    "all typical outburst characteristics were observed for ( see  [ spectra ] ) , as well as a clear dependence on the rotational phase of the crustal heating , which was localized in a few degrees of surface , creating a localized hot spot , possibly on the magnetic pole , which cooled down until its quiescent emission level .",
    "the long - term magneto - thermal evolution , simulated with the @xcite code , indicates that this source is consistent with being born @xmath1kyr ago ( not too far from its 16kyr characteristic age ) with an initial dipolar magnetic field of @xmath2 g. this exact value depends , by a factor @xmath362 , on the parameters of the neutron star ( mass , radius , inclination angle ) and on the poorly known internal magnetic configuration . in figure",
    "[ mod ] , we show the evolution of period , period derivative , the source track in the @xmath37-@xmath38 diagram , and the thermal , bolometric luminosity .",
    "as generally found in magnetars , the temperature inferred from the bb+pl fit is of the same order of , although somewhat higher than , what predicted by the evolutionary model ( 100 - 200 ev , depending on the details and the internal geometry ) .",
    "the mismatch ( by a factor @xmath393 ) is well within what can be expected from the assumptions of both the emission and evolution models .",
    "it is known that spectral fitting with resonant compton scattering models results in a lower temperature , closer to that of the cooling models , even keeping the assumption of blackbody seed photons .",
    "actually , thermal radiation from the star surface is likely different from a simple blackbody , because of local reprocessing by some sort of atmosphere or , on the contrary , because the surface is in a condensed state .",
    "moreover , the hot spot temperature is not uniform and geometrical effects ( viewing angle , inclination of the magnetic axis ) come into play ; these are not accounted for as yet . given these uncertainties ,",
    "we rather compare the luminosity , which depends on the distance , but not much on the details of the model .    we note that this source belong to a vast group of magnetars (",
    "1e 1547 - 5408 , sgr 1627 - 41 , sgr 1745 - 2900 , xte j1810 - 197 , sgr 1833 - 0832 , 4u 0142 + 614 , cxo 1647 - 4552 ) , which timing properties are linked by the same evolutionary track , compatible with being born with an initial field of @xmath40 g , as discussed in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "most magnetars are born with a narrow range of magnetic field values , and the timing and spectral differences between them are due only to their particular ages .",
    "we have also compared the observed outburst decay with the detailed theoretical model presented in @xcite , and used to reproduce the outburst decay of other magnetars @xcite . starting with a neutron star with",
    "@xmath41 g and the crust temperature fixed to reproduce the flux observed by rosat in 1992 at the estimated distance , we simulate the starquake by injecting @xmath42 erg in the crust layer between @xmath43 and @xmath44 g @xmath45 in a polar cap of about 30 degrees around the pole .",
    "we then follow the thermal evolution of the crust until it returns to the original state .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ mod_jose ] , where we compare the theoretical model with the _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
