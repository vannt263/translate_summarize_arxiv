    "although hadrons are small bags of confined quarks , at low and intermediate energies what is observed are mesons and baryons , suggesting that the genuine qcd degrees of freedom may not be adequate for the study of nuclear structure at this energy regime . at low energies the nuclear dynamics",
    "is described in terms of nucleons interacting via potentials , within the framework of the schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equations . at intermediate energies ,",
    "however , the non relativistic ( nr ) quantum mechanical approach may fail .",
    "in particular , for processes with high momentum and energy transfer , we may expect the nr scattering equation to be inadequate to describe the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering .",
    "the nr scattering equation , or lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation , gives the nn scattering amplitude @xmath0 , as : t(*p^ * , * p*;w)=v(*p^ * , * p*;w)- v(*p^*,*k*;w ) t(*k*,*p*;w ) , [ ls ] where @xmath1 is the nucleon mass , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the initial , final and intermediate relative 3-momenta ; @xmath5 is the total energy which depends on @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the interaction kernel .",
    "this kernel , in a nr framework , describes the instantaneous interaction or potential .",
    "the homogeneous term involves also an effective 2-particle scalar propagator .    for a relativistic formulation",
    ", we have several alternative equations since there is not a unique description dictated from first principles @xcite .",
    "an implementation of relativity which satisfies covariance explicitly leads to the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) scattering equation @xcite : t(p^ , p;p)=v(p^ , p;p)+ i v(p^,k;p ) g(k;p ) t(k , p;p ) .",
    "[ bs ] here @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the final , initial and intermediate relative 4-momenta , and @xmath11 the total system 4-momentum . as for @xmath7 , the interaction kernel , it consists of the sum of all irreducible interaction processes derived from a considered lagrangian . in the scalar case",
    "the 2-particle propagator @xmath12 is given by g(k;p)=. [ gscalar ]    contrarily to the ls equation , which is 3-dimensional and includes only instantaneous interactions , the bs is a 4-dimensional integral equation and its kernel includes retardation and a dependence on the virtual intermediate states energy ( off - mass - shell effects ) . since the exact solution of the bs equation with the complete kernel is still out of reach of present calculation capabilities , several approximations have been developed . nevertheless , all these different methods have in common the truncation of the kernel , which keeps only a restrict set of meson exchange diagrams . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 4-dimensional bs equations was applied by tjon and collaborators to the nn problem with a kernel derived from one - boson - exchange ( obe ) generating the so called ladder approximation .",
    "it has been proved , however , that the ladder approximation does not verify the one - body limit @xcite .",
    "the addition to the obe kernel of a crossed - box diagram , implementing a particular off - mass shell extrapolation , has been done by theul and desplanques @xcite for a scalar bound state problem .",
    "alternatively , for the same problem phillips and wallace @xcite simulated the cross - box diagram through a specific modification of the 2-particle propagator and the result is known as the so called 4d equal - time equation .",
    "calculations considering ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams have been performed by nieuwenhuis and tjon @xcite , based on a feynman - schwinger formalism and monte - carlo techniques .",
    "the calculations are , however , still restricted to scalar particles and the bound state cases .",
    "even with a truncated kernel the bs equation is , beyond ladder approximation , very hard to solve .",
    "this difficulty has triggered the development of covariant 3-dimensional reduction equations .",
    "these can be classified into two classes : the quasipotential ( qp ) type equations and the klein type equations .    in the qp equations",
    "the 3-dimensional reduction is achieved by fixing the relative energy @xmath13 in a covariant way .",
    "these equations can formally be written as a bs equation , if we replace @xmath12 by another propagator @xmath14 including a covariant energy constraint . in the last years",
    "two qp equations have been applied extensively to hadronic physics problems : the blankenbecler and sugar ( bbs ) @xcite and the spectator ( sp ) , or gross equations @xcite .",
    "the bbs equation @xcite , is constructed assuming that , in all intermediate states , the two particles are equally off - mass - shell .",
    "the sp equation @xcite , is obtained restricting one particle to its positive - energy on - mass - shell state in all the intermediate states . although this equation is exact for scalar particles in the one - body limit , when applied to the nn interaction it implies approximations .",
    "furthermore , to account for the identity of the two particles , a symmetrized propagator has to be used @xcite . in the bbs equation",
    "the interaction is instantaneous because the exchange boson do not carry any energy , since both nucleons are equally off - mass - shell , whereas in the sp equation energy exchange is allowed and therefore retardation is included .",
    "another qp equation , the 3d equal - time ( et ) equation , was proposed by mandelzweig and wallace to deal with the qed problem of spin @xmath15 particles @xcite , and with spin zero and spin @xmath15 particles with boson exchange cases @xcite . in this equation",
    "the interaction is also instantaneous and includes the crossed - box diagram in the eikonal approximation , or high energy limit @xcite , where the forward scattering components are dominant .",
    "this 3d et equation has been applied by by tjon and collaborators to the nn system with an one - boson - exchange kernel @xcite .",
    "calculations have shown that the 3d et equation results are the closest to the bs with obe and crossed - box kernel for the bound state of scalar particles @xcite .",
    "henceforth we refer the 3d et equation as et equation .",
    "the klein equation , obtained also from the bs equation , is related with time ordered perturbation theory without anti - particles @xcite , and was used by the nijmegen @xcite and bonn @xcite groups in their applications to two - meson - exchange calculations .    in this work we study relativistic effects included in the most well known qp equations - bbs , sp , thompson ( th ) @xcite and erkelenz - holinde ( eh ) @xcite - and",
    "compare their results with ones obtained with the nr lippman - schwinger equation .",
    "since the exact solution of the relativistic equation is not known , there is no exact relativistic answer to be taken as a reference .",
    "therefore , we focus on the analysis of the relativistic content of the different qp equations .",
    "our natural reference , consequently , is the nonrelativistic ls equation .",
    "we emphasize , at this point , that the bs equation in ladder approximation , which has been taken as a reference in the past @xcite , has been shown to be inadequate for that purpose because , on the one hand , does not reproduce the one - body limit , as mentioned before , and , on the other hand , excludes non negligible contributions of the crossed - box diagrams , as found by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a first step ,",
    "we consider in all our calculations ( corresponding to different equations ) , only scalar particles interacting through the malfliet - tjon potential @xcite . only by using the same interaction in all the dynamical cases we are able to withdraw conclusions about the way the different formalisms introduce relativistic effects .",
    "the relativistic effects considered come from kinematics , retardation and negative - energy state components of the propagators .",
    "we point out that retardation is automatically excluded from the instantaneous bbs equation . as for the negative - energy state effects ,",
    "the different equations account for them in different ways , as it will be shown .    in sec .",
    "[ secqp ] we present the qp formalism , and give the explicit expression of all the propagators . in sec .",
    "[ secdecomp ] , we use the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , reviewed in references @xcite , to distinguish between the equations that include retardation from the others where the interaction is instantaneous .",
    "we also introduce the representation of wallace and madelzweig @xcite to separate the positive and negative - energy state effects , and discuss the suppression of the negative - energy states contributions . in reference @xcite a similar derivation was presented , but none of them discuss explicitly retardation effects , which is one of the main goals of the present work . in sec .",
    "[ secnpwd ] we explain the numerical method used to evaluate the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes , which does not involve a partial wave decomposition .",
    "this method is based on the work of elster and collaborators @xcite in a nr framework . in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] we show and discuss the results for the scattering amplitude at two different energies . as an example",
    "we also show the phase shifts for the s - wave . in sec .",
    "[ seccon ] we summarize and draw some final conclusions and remarks .",
    "the bs equation ( [ bs ] ) , can be written in a shorthand notation as t = v+vgt .",
    "[ compactbs ]    a common approximation consists on restricting @xmath7 to the one boson exchange ( obe ) diagrams , and is usually called the ladder approximation .",
    "there are two main objections to this approximation : firstly , as mentioned before , the one body limit is not recovered when one of the masses goes to infinity @xcite ; secondly , it has been shown that , in general , crossed - ladder diagrams may have important contributions @xcite and hence should not be neglected .",
    "alternative ways consists on the replacement of bs eq .",
    "( [ compactbs ] ) by the set of equations : t&=&k+kgt [ qp1 ] + k&=&v+v(g - g)k , [ qp2 ] which is perfectly equivalent to the bs equation , and where @xmath14 is a different 2-particle propagator , containing the 3-dimensional reduction . since there are no first principle rules to dictate how this reduction should be performed , a large ambiguity gives room to many options",
    ". usually , different approximations compromise different appropriate choices of the constraint on the energy - component of the 4-momentum in the propagator @xmath14 , and different truncations of the kernel @xmath16 .",
    "the rate of convergence of the new kernel @xmath16 is determined by the difference @xmath17 . if @xmath14 is a good approximation to @xmath12 , then only the first term in eq .",

    "( [ qp1 ] ) and ( [ qp2 ] ) reduces to one simpler 3-dimensional , but still covariant , equation .",
    "this is the standard procedure in any application of qp equations .",
    "if needed and possible , the lowest order truncation of the kernel @xmath18 can be corrected by higher order terms .",
    "any finite order truncation of the kernel beyond the obe approximation generates unphysical singularities in the scattering equation , due to the delta function constraint on the energy@xcite . for this reason 3-dimensional qp equations with kernels",
    "not restricted to the obe form became controversial @xcite .",
    "however , we point out that it has been shown that the contribution of the two - pion subtracted @xcite and crossed - box diagrams can be simulated by effective @xmath19 and @xmath20 vector meson exchanges @xcite .",
    "this result supports the usefulness of the obe approximation .    in the present work we apply several qp equations , with an obe kernel , to the scattering of scalar particles .",
    "more specifically , we considered the scalar malfliet - tjon potential and took the form of this potential as the kernel of all the equations considered .",
    "we perform the calculations in the c.m .",
    "reference frame , where the expressions are simpler . in this frame",
    "the bethe - salpeter to 2-particle propagator is written as g(k;p)=. [ gbs ] here @xmath21 represents the magnitude of @xmath4 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , if both initial particles are on - mass - shell .",
    "this expression differs from the original of eq .",
    "( [ gscalar ] ) by the factor @xmath24 , which is introduced for convenience .",
    "in fact , in the scalar case both the kernel and the amplitude @xmath0 are dimensionless , whereas the amplitude generated by the ls equation , which refers to fermions , has dimensions of inverse of energy squared . in order to compare the solutions of the two equations",
    ", we must redefine @xmath7 and @xmath0 of the scalar equation by dividing them by @xmath24 , meaning that we have to redefine the propagator by multiplying it by the same factor .",
    "this procedure implies the use of dimensionless couplings for both the scalar and dirac cases .    as mentioned in the introduction , in the present work we consider the following qp equations : the sp , th , bbs , eh and the et .",

    "more significative is the et result , which has more content of negative - energy components than the eh one , and is closer to the nr result .",
    "we remind here that the et propagator without negative - energy states corresponds to bbs@xmath65 ( bbs with only positive - energy states ) . by comparing the retardation effects that are present in eh and absent in bbs",
    ", we conclude that retardation also decreases the real part of the amplitude .",
    "this is valid for the positive - energy versions and for the full versions .",
    "once again , we may conclude that the combined effects of retardation and negative - energy state components tend to approximate the relativistic calculations to the nr ones .",
    "the fact that the et curve , which does not contain retardation , is the closest to the nr result is explained by the larger contribution of the negative - energy state components in its propagator .",
    "the full scattering amplitude results for the five qp equations along with the nr one can be observed in fig .",
    "[ figgeral ] .",
    "the curves shown confirm the conclusion drawn above , namely that the combined effect of retardation and negative - energy state contributions tend to approximate the relativistic calculations to the nr ones .",
    "we point out , however , that the full result depends upon a delicate interplay of these two relativistic effects , and , in particular , on the amount of the contribution of negative - energy state components of the propagators .",
    "this can clearly be seen by comparing the sp result ( no @xmath43 ) with the eh result ( with @xmath43 ) , being the first the closest to the nr limit .",
    "all the previous considerations about the real part of the scattering amplitude remain valid for the imaginary part with an opposite direction that is , in general retardation and negative - energy effects increases the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "we note that the result from the bbs equation which , accordingly to eqs .   ( [ gbbs ] ) and ( [ gnr2 ] ) , indeed generates the nr equation when we replace @xmath66 by 1 , deviates , the most from the nr result .    finally ,",
    "as an example , we show in fig .  [ phases ]",
    "the phase shifts for the @xmath67 partial wave , generated by the different qp equations , as a function of the incoming energy .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , at low energies the different equations generate similar results , but at higher energies discrepancies are obvious . in this partial wave the phases generated by the eh and th equations are the closest to the nr ones , contrarily to what happens with the full t - matrix , where the sp and the et are the closest .",
    "this fact has a very simple interpretation , stemming from the fact that at high energies the contribution to the transition matrix of the more peripherical partial waves becomes quite important , and therefore looking only to the s - wave channel is a very limited analysis .",
    "this conclusion is also achieved in the work of ref .",
    "we consider a family of relativistic quasipotential scattering equations , and study the effects of retardation and negative - energy state contributions in the propagators .",
    "we restrict our calculation , for the time being , to the scalar case .",
    "comparison with the nr equation is provided .",
    "the numerical calculations of the @xmath0 matrices were done without partial wave decomposition .",
    "instead , we solved the two - dimensional integral equation , and the accuracy of the method was checked through identity provided by the optical theorem .",
    "the method implied a discretization of the integral variables with 17 - 25 grid points for the magnitude of the relative momentum , and 20 - 50 grid points for the angular variables .",
    "the nr solutions were compared with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where also the partial wave decomposition has been avoided .",
    "this comparison provided an extra check to our method .",
    "we conclude that , in general , retardation decreases the real part of the scattering amplitude , and increases the imaginary part of the same amplitude .",
    "the inclusion of negative - energy state contributions induces a similar effect .",
    "the equations that include the @xmath41 term , i.e. the ones containing additional negative - energy state effects , deviate the most from the nr results .",
    "we found also that the sp and the et equations generate the scattering amplitudes which are the closest to the nr result .",
    "we also point out that the sp ( with retardation but no @xmath41 terms ) and the et equations ( without retardation but with @xmath41 terms ) consider , in an effective way , some contribution from the crossed - box diagrams . on the other hand ,",
    "the et equation , on top of the @xmath41 term , includes further negative - energy state effects , associated with its specific way of describing effectively the crossed - box diagrams .",
    "these additional terms compensate partially the absence of retardation .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the inclusion of crossed - box diagrams , even in an effective way , approaches the qp results to nr ones .",
    "it is interesting to note that the way the spectator formalism deals with negative - energy state components , retardation and effective crossed - box diagrams , makes the corresponding amplitudes the closest to the nr limit , even at high energies .",
    "finally we note that the relative uncertainty in the real part of the scattering @xmath0 matrix due to different dynamical equations depends on the scattering angle and is the narrowest near the forward - scattering region . in the backward - scattering",
    ", it can be as large as 40% .",
    "this could be expected since in this region the momentum transfer is larger .    in this work we restrict ourselves to spin zero particles .",
    "however , calculations to account relativistically for the spin @xmath15 , such that our formalism can be applied to the nucleon - nucleon system , is on progress . in such a more realistic calculation , the uncertainty band found in this work for the @xmath0 matrix will most likely imply differences in the nucleon - nucleon interaction , compatible with the scattering data and originated by the different dynamical formalisms .",
