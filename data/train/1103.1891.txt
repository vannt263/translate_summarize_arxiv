    "there is ( at least ) one significant challenge to this analysis : galaxies cluster with one another .",
    "therefore , if a galaxy lies at close impact parameter to a sightline there is a significant probability that one or more additional galaxies will also lie close to the same sightline .",
    "if we then detect igm absorption at that redshift , there is an ambiguous association between the gas and each galaxy .",
    "one may be able to design an experiment that studied only isolated galaxies , but this would likely be unrepresentative of the full galaxy population .",
    "this issue is further complicated by the imperfections of our lco / wfccd survey .",
    "these include ( i ) the magnitude limit which implies sensitivity to fainter galaxies only at lower redshifts ; ( ii ) the limited field - of - view which precludes a search for galaxies with @xmath124kpc at the lowest redshifts ; and ( iii ) the varying sensitivity of the uv spectrometers with wavelength which dictates the equivalent width limit to  and  absorption as a function of redshift . in the following , we emphasize these limitations where appropriate .",
    "to ( partially ) address the ambiguity of multiple galaxies at a given redshift , we perform the analysis separately for dwarf , , and  galaxies . initially",
    ", we examine all galaxies at impact parameter @xmath125kpc from the sightlines .",
    "this distance was arbitrarily chosen to exceed the virial radius of the galaxies yet to be small enough to primarily focus the analysis on individual galaxies .",
    "when two or more galaxies are separated by @xmath126 and have similar luminosity , we only present the one closest to the sightline ( this occurs very rarely ) .",

    "gas also arises in the extended cgm of these galaxies .",
    "the direct implication is that the two phenomena (  absorption and dwarf galaxies ) are simply highly correlated tracers of the same large - scale overdensity in the universe ( e.g.  a filament ) .",

    "we identify no other galaxies at this redshift and only note that it might be associated with the extreme outskirts of virgo .",
    "either way , this non - detection stresses that the igm / galaxy connection shows special cases that contradict dominant trends .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : dwarfs ] present the equivalent width of  1031 (; when uv spectral coverage exists ) and an estimate of the o@xmath201 column density  for the strongest absorber within 300  of each galaxy .",

    "ignoring these systems , 0/13 of ` isolated ' dwarf galaxies show a positive detection to an equivalent width limit of 200m  and only 2/8 for a 50m  limit .",

    "these results are empirical descriptions of the gas associated with galaxies ; we explore further the implications for the origins of and  absorption in the following sections .      in the previous sub - section",
    ", we studied the  and  absorption associated with galaxies at low impact parameters to quasar sightlines . for that analysis , the measures ( luminosity , impact parameter , equivalent width ) were all well - defined and the results were relatively insensitive to biases related to incompleteness in the galaxy survey .",
    "the key complication of such analysis , however , is that galaxies cluster and therefore their environment ( e.g.  the presence of a brighter , nearby neighbor ) may play a significant role in observed associations between a galaxy and the igm .",
    "furthermore , this approach only indirectly addresses fundamental questions related to the origin of  and  gas in the igm",
    ".    one may gain further insight by reversing the experiment , i.e.  to study the properties of the closest ( detected ) galaxy to a given set of igm absorption lines . in this manner ,",
    "one tests how frequently galaxies and their halos are associated with various components of the igm , and one may assess their physical properties and environment .",
    "this approach , however , has the obvious downside that no galaxy survey is truly complete , neither in terms of field - of - view nor depth .",
    "indeed , our survey does not cover sufficient area to identify all galaxies within @xmath289kpc for @xmath290 and our magnitude limit implies significant incompleteness to @xmath274 in most fields for @xmath291 .",
    "therefore , we restrict the following analysis and discussion to the redshift interval @xmath292 and caution that at the high end we have limited sensitivity to very faint galaxies .        in figure",

    "we conclude that _ few , if any , of the weak  absorbers arise from the virialized halos of @xmath95 galaxies . _ instead , weak absorption traces either the extended cgm of galaxies or , more commonly , structures with a low filling factor of galaxies ( non - detections ) .",
    "the results are similar for the  lines with modest ( @xmath295@xmath296 ) , although the incidence of an association to a galaxy with @xmath297mpc is higher ( 70% ) .",
    "for the small set of strong absorption lines ( @xmath24 ) , the results are qualitatively different .",

    ", however , the association with a virialized halo may be tenuous .",
    "altogether , our results do offer further evidence that large  absorbers are physically associated with galaxies whereas weak  lines have no direct physical connection @xcite .",
    "turning to  absorption , figure  [ fig : ovi_gal ] shows the galaxy at the closest impact parameter to the 30 published  absorbers along our quasar sightlines with @xmath299 ( table  [ tab : oviabs ] ) .",

    "this offset is smaller than that observed for  lines having @xmath302 . on the other hand , only a small fraction of the  systems ( 5/30 ) have a galaxy detected within 100kpc and only 1/18 for @xmath303 .",
    "there are very few cases in the sample where one would insist that the sightline has intersected the virialized halo of the associated galaxy",
    ". instead , the  gas appears linked to the extended cgm of galaxies on scales of a few hundred kpc .",
    "the luminosities of the nearest neighbors include galaxies at a wide range of luminosity and spectral type , with a preference toward late - type  systems .",
    "there is an apparent trend of decreasing @xmath123 with increasing  for the range of values considered in our analysis , but this is tempered by the large scatter in these quantities .",
    "as emphasized at the start of this sub - section , the results presented in figures  [ fig : lya_gal ] and [ fig : ovi_gal ] are subject to the incompleteness of our galaxy survey .",
    "in particular , one may argue that a population of fainter galaxies lie at smaller impact parameters than the sample comprising our survey .",
    "this could significantly affect our inferences regarding the roles of virialized halos and the extended cgm in hosting /  absorption . to assess this concern , tables  [ tab : oviabs ] lists the luminosity limit for each absorber and the completeness of the galaxy survey to that limit for @xmath304kpc .",
    "regarding completeness , with the exception of two fields ( pg1116 + 215 and pg1211 + 143 ) , we obtained a redshift for every galaxy within @xmath305kpc of the  absorber to the magnitude limit @xmath306mag .",
    "we are confident , therefore , that no galaxy of comparable luminosity lies at closer distance to the sightline than the ones we have discovered . , or @xmath307kpc for the redshifts considered ) , we expect these to be very rare occurrences and note that none of the sightlines exhibit very large column densities ( @xmath308 ) . ] regarding the luminosity limit , a subset of the galaxies lie within twice the limit yet @xmath309 are @xmath310 brighter than the formal limit .",
    "furthermore , owing to the details of mask design and specific scientific interests , we have surveyed several fields to @xmath311mag albeit with lower completeness .",
    "the galaxies discovered to these fainter magnitudes have been included in the analysis .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that our results are unlikely to be severely compromised by a lack of sensitivity to fainter galaxies .",

    "we begin with a discussion of the properties of gas surrounding low-@xmath19 galaxies ( @xmath125kpc ) .",
    "several previous studies have examined the incidence of  absorption for galaxies located at small impact parameters to quasar sightlines . in each case , the authors have reported a very high detection rate for galaxies within a few hundred kpc : @xcite found positive detections for 29/31 of their predominantly  galaxies to @xmath336kpc with @xmath7m  and reported a sharp decline at larger impact parameter ; @xcite detected  lines with @xmath337 for 8/8 of the galaxies located within @xmath338kpc of their quasar sightlines , and @xcite reported positive detections for 7/7 of the @xmath339 field galaxies in their sample when restricting to @xmath340kpc .    with our lco / wfccd survey we have examined a sample of 37 galaxies at @xmath125kpc with greater emphasis on lower luminosities than previous work .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : dwarfs][fig : subls ] ( tables  [ tab : dwarfs][tab : subls ] ) further solidify the correlation between galaxies and  absorption : to an impact parameter of @xmath341kpc , we observe a nearly 100%probability for detecting  absorption ( @xmath342m ) within @xmath343 of a galaxy .",
    "this result is independent of galaxy luminosity ( for @xmath344 ) , spectral type , and local environment ( defined by the number of close neighbors ) .",
    "altogether , these results demand that low-@xmath19 galaxies of all types are embedded within a diffuse , highly ionized medium with a very high covering fraction to significant absorption .",
    "we refer to this medium as the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) , although this gas need not be physically associated ( e.g.  bound ) to the galaxy .    before considering the origin of this medium , we review and then explore its physical properties .",
    "first , we note that the doppler parameters that are typical of low-@xmath19  lines generally require kinetic temperatures @xmath345k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the standard expectation is that the majority of these absorbers trace photoionized gas with @xmath26k . for those absorption systems that also exhibit metal - line transitions ( e.g.  , , ) ,",
    "this hypothesis may be tested against ionization modeling and the results are usually consistent with a photoionized medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this modeling also provides a constraint on the ionization fraction and an estimate of the total hydrogen column density @xmath346 .",
    "a remarkable result for the low-@xmath19 igm is that the estimated @xmath6 values are uniform at @xmath347 , i.e. , independent of the observed  value @xcite .",
    "this ` @xmath6 constancy ' was interpreted by @xcite to result from lower  absorbers having lower average volume density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which implies a higher ionization correction for a uniform ( background ) radiation field .",
    "indeed , analysis of recent simulations of the low-@xmath19 igm have considered the @xmath6 constancy explicitly and have reproduced the observed result with a similar explanation @xcite .",
    "we caution that this @xmath6 constancy was derived empirically from absorbers with @xmath348 which had no known association to galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate below , however , that the majority of the stronger  systems must be associated with galaxies .    adopting a constant @xmath6 value for the observed  forest , we may crudely estimate the mass of the photoionized cgm surrounding  galaxies .",
    "a simple estimate follows from the characteristic hydrogen column density @xmath349 and a characteristic radius :    @xmath350    with the factor @xmath351 accounting for helium . for our assumed values ,",
    "we find    @xmath352    therefore , we estimate a baryonic reservoir surrounding each galaxy which meets or significantly exceeds the typical baryonic mass of present - day  galaxies . again , this cgm need not be physically associated ( e.g.  gravitationally bound ) with the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , it represents a large baryonic reservoir for future star formation or could even ( in part ) be gas that was expelled during the processes of galaxy formation .",
