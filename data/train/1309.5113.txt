    "one of the important probes of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is the suppressed production of @xmath0 as a result of the color screening of the potential between charm and anticharm quarks , as first suggested in ref .",
    "studies of @xmath0 production in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 collisions  @xcite have indicated , however , that besides this hot medium effect  @xcite , there is also the normal suppression  @xcite due to cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "the cold nuclear matter effects  @xcite include the nuclear absorption  @xcite that the initially produced @xmath0 can be destroyed by the passing nucleons , the cronin effect  @xcite that the gluons gain transverse momentum before fusing into a @xmath0 due to the scattering with other nucleons , and the shadowing effect  @xcite that the parton distribution function in a nucleus is different from that in free nucleons .",
    "furthermore , there are other hot medium effects due to the gluon dissociation of @xmath0 that have been described in terms of various theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the charm and anticharm quarks in the produced qgp may combine to form @xmath0s .",
    "this regeneration process has been studied either using the statistical hadronization model  @xcite or included in the kinetic approach as the inverse of the dissociation process  @xcite .",
    "the regeneration effect is expected to be large in @xmath9 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite due to the appreciable number of charm quarks and anticharm quarks produced in these collisions .",
    "its contribution to @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) can also be important due to the canonical enhancement effect in spite of the small number of charm and anticharm quarks in collisions at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "also , the study of @xmath0  has been extended to its excited states  @xcite , bottomonia  @xcite and @xmath10  mesons  @xcite .    for cold nuclear matter effects , it has been suggested that they can be understood from studying @xmath7 or @xmath8 collisions because a hot medium is not expected to be formed in these collisions .",
    "this has been the case at the sps and the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite . at the lhc , because of the higher multiplicity of produced particles , especially in central collisions , final - state hot medium effects can also be present besides the initial - state cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "for example , the multiplicity of charged hadrons @xmath11 in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath12 tev  @xcite is around @xmath13 in the most central 5% collisions  @xcite .",
    "since the energy carried by these charged particles and other neutral particles is initially localized in a volume of the size of a proton , the energy density at the beginning of the collision can be sufficient high for the formation of a qgp .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration has measured the nuclear modification factor of @xmath0  in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2  tev  @xcite .",
    "although the cold nuclear matter effects have been studied  @xcite , there is not yet any study on the hot medium effects in these collisions . in this paper",
    ", we use a transport model  @xcite , which was previously used to study @xmath0 suppression and regeneration at rhic and lhc , to study the nuclear modification factor and the the double ratio @xmath5 of prompt quarkonia produced in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ se_bulk ] , we give a short description of the 2 + 1 dimensional hydrodynamic model used in the present study for describing the evolution dynamics of produced qgp . the transport approach used for studying the dissociation and regeneration of @xmath0 in the qgp is then discussed in sec .",

    "[ se_conclusions ] .",
    "we describe the bulk dynamics of @xmath1 collisions at @xmath12 tev by the 2 + 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equation @xmath14 with the boost invariant condition @xmath15 , where @xmath16  is the energy - momentum tensor in terms of the energy density @xmath17 , pressure @xmath18 , and four velocity @xmath19 . for the equation of state @xmath20",

    "@xcite based on an ideal gas of massless partons for the qgp and massive hadrons for the hadronic matter , together with a bag constant @xmath21 that leads to a critical temperature @xmath22 mev  @xcite . since most colliding nucleons pass through each other without much stopping , we take the net baryon density of produced matter to be zero .     at proper time @xmath23 @xmath24 in the most central @xmath25 @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 tev from the ampt model as a function of the coordinate @xmath26  relative to the center of the proton along the direction of the impact parameter @xmath27 for different rapidity @xmath28.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic evolution , they are generated from a multiple phase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite ( version : v2.26t1 ) .",
    "specifically , we run @xmath29 @xmath1 events and select the most central 10% collisions to obtain the energy density @xmath17 . with the centrality determined by the multiplicity of initially produced partons in the whole rapidity range , which is approximately equal to that determined by the multiplicity of final charged hadrons , the corresponding average impact parameter is @xmath30 fm . by shifting the origin of",
    "the transverse coordinates to the center of the proton in the transverse plane before taking an average over all selected events and with the center of the pb nucleus lying on the negative @xmath26-axis , the resulting energy density at an initial proper time @xmath23 fm/@xmath31 as a function of coordinate @xmath26 is shown in fig .",

    "the maximum energy density @xmath32  gev/@xmath33 appears at rapidity @xmath34 and the corresponding temperature @xmath35 calculated from the noninteracting qgp model is about @xmath36  mev , which is between the maximum values in @xmath9  collisions at sps and rhic . for the centrality bin of @xmath37 ,",
    "in which the multiplicity of charged hadrons is very close to that in the minimum bias case  @xcite , the initial energy density @xmath17 is about a factor of @xmath38 smaller than that in the most central 10% bin .     at rapidity @xmath34 in the most central @xmath25",

    "it is seen that the energy density at the center decreases quickly after @xmath40 @xmath24 proper time .",
    "for example , at @xmath41 @xmath24 the energy density at the center is reduced by one order of magnitude from its value at the initial time @xmath40 @xmath24 .",
    "this is due to the fast expansion of the produced matter not only in the longitudinal direction but also in the transverse direction that is driven by the large pressure or energy density gradient resulting from the high initial energy density and the smaller size of the matter .",
    "indeed , the transverse diameter of the produced matter increases by about @xmath42 fm from @xmath40 @xmath24 to @xmath41 @xmath24 , indicating a transverse expansion velocity close to half the velocity of light . as a result ,",
    "the energy density at the center decreases quickly and becomes even smaller than that in the peripheral region at later times .",
    "because of color screening in qgp , a @xmath0 can not survive above a dissociation temperature @xmath43 .",

    "the transition rate @xmath63  is related to the @xmath0 dissociation cross section @xmath56  by the detailed balance relation . for the distribution function @xmath64 of charm quarks , it is taken to have following factorized form for simplicity : @xmath65 where @xmath66  is the number density of charm quarks and satisfies the conservation equation @xmath67 with @xmath68  being the velocity of the medium , and @xmath69^{-1}$ ]  is the normalization factor for the fermi distribution . for the anticharm quarks , their distribution function @xmath70 has a similar form .    the factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([eq_beta ] ) take into account , respectively , the charm quark non - equilibrium effect and the canonical effect due to few pairs of charm and anticharm quarks produced in a @xmath1 collision , that are neglected in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because of the short qgp lifetime , charm quarks are not expected to be fully thermalized  @xcite , leading to a reduction of the regeneration rate through the relaxation factor @xmath73 introduced in ref .  @xcite . for the relaxation time @xmath74 , we take its value to be @xmath75 @xmath24 as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath76 collisions at sps energy and @xmath77 collisions at rhic energy .",
    "the canonical effect has been shown to be responsible for the suppressed production of strange mesons  @xcite when few strange quarks are produced . with few pairs of charm and anticharm quarks",
    "produced in an event , the same effect becomes important and enhances charmonia production in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",

    "since a charm and anticharm quark pair is produced at same rapidity , the canonical enhancement factor for @xmath0 production in a rapidity bin @xmath85 becomes @xmath86  @xcite .",

    "considering the uncertainties in theories and experiments , this difference in the @xmath4 of @xmath0 is not sensitive enough to verify whether there are hot medium effects in p+pb collisions .",
    "since the hot medium effects on the ground state and the excited states of quarkonia , are expected to be dramatically different according to the picture of sequential dissociation  @xcite , the double ratio @xmath132 of prompt @xmath133 to prompt @xmath0 would be a good probe to the hot medium effects .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dr ] , where the double ratio is seen to be far less than one at the backward rapidity.this is because the dissociation temperature @xmath43 of @xmath130 is only slightly higher than the critical temperature @xmath134 , leading thus to its strong suppression at backward rapidity where the temperature of the fireball is high .",
    "the value of the double ratio at the forward rapidity is , on other hand , much larger , since the temperature of the fireball is lower and the hot medium effects are less important .",
    "experimental study of the double ratio @xmath135 thus provides the possibility to verify the existence of the hot medium effects in @xmath1 collisions at the lhc energy .",
    "we note that although the contribution of regenerated @xmath117 to @xmath0 production is small , its contribution to final @xmath117 is large at backward rapidity where few initially produced @xmath117 survives .",

    "our results indicate that the suppression of @xmath0 production due to screening and thermal dissociation is more important than the contribution due to regeneration from the charm and anticharm quarks in the produced qgp , which leads to a smaller @xmath0 nuclear modification factor @xmath120 than in the case of including only the cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "we have also found that the canonical enhancement effect due to smaller number of produced charm and anticharm quarks is important for the regeneration contribution since it would be negligible otherwise .",
    "we have further predicted the @xmath120 of @xmath0 for the most central @xmath25 collisions and suggested the measurement of the double ratio @xmath132  in @xmath1 collisions , which would be dramatically smaller than one if there exist the hot medium effects .",
