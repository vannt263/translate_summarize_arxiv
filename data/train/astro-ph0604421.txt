    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) are our nearest - neighbour galaxies and , to date , the only galaxies other than our own which have detectable pulsars .",
    "the first systematic survey for radio pulsars in the magellanic clouds was by @xcite who used a receiver with center frequency 645 mhz and bandwidth 25 mhz on the parkes 64-m radio telescope to search 7 square degrees of the lmc .",
    "this survey uncovered the first known extra - galactic pulsar , psr b0529@xmath166 , which has a period of 0.975 s and a dispersion measure ( dm ) of 103 @xmath2 pc which clearly places it outside the galactic free - electron layer .",
    "this survey was subsequently extended by @xcite to cover both the lmc and the smc with higher sensitivity using a receiver with center frequency 610 mhz , a bandwidth 60 mhz in each of two orthogonal polarizations and 5-ms sampling . with an observation time of 5000",
    "s per pointing , the limiting mean flux density at 610 mhz was 0.5 to 0.8 mjy for pulsars with periods greater than about 500 ms and dms of 100 @xmath2 pc or less .",
    "four pulsars were discovered , one in the smc , two in the lmc and one foreground pulsar .",
    "the smc pulsar , now known as psr j0045@xmath17319 , was shown by @xcite to be in a 51-day orbit round a massive star , optically identified as a 16th - magnitude b star .",
    "the identification was subsequently confirmed by the detection of orbital doppler shifts in spectral lines from the b - star , showing that the star has a mass of 8  10 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "many young pulsars emit pulsed emission in the x - ray band and sometimes detection is easier in this band than at radio wavelengths .",
    "two such pulsars which are clearly located in the lmc are known .",
    "the first , psr b0540@xmath169 , was discovered by @xcite using data from the _ einstein x - ray observatory_. with a pulse period of 50.2 ms and a characteristic age of just 1670 years , it has properties very similar to those of the crab pulsar and is located at the center of the supernova remnant ( snr ) 0540@xmath1693 in the lmc @xcite .",
    "this pulsar was detected in the radio band by @xcite at 640 mhz with a very broad pulse and mean flux density of about 0.4 mjy .",
    "giant radio pulses at 1400 mhz were detected from psr b0540@xmath169 by @xcite and subsequently the 1400-mhz mean pulse emission was observed with a flux density of just 24 @xmath4jy by @xcite .",
    "another young magellanic cloud pulsar , psr j0537@xmath16910 , was detected by @xcite using observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_. this pulsar lies within the snr n  157b in the lmc and has the shortest period , 16.1 ms , of any known young ( unrecycled ) pulsar .",
    "its characteristic age is 5000 years , close to the estimated age of n  157b .",
    "radio searches for pulsed emission from this pulsar have been unsuccessful , with the best limit on the mean flux density , 10 @xmath4jy at 1400 mhz , being set by @xcite .    a decade after the @xcite search",
    ", @xcite exploited the high survey efficiency of the 13-beam parkes 20-cm multibeam receiver @xcite to undertake a higher - sensitivity survey of the smc .",
    "a total area of @xmath5 square degrees was covered in 12 pointings of the instrument , with 0.25-ms sampling interval and 8400 s observation time per pointing giving a 1400-mhz limiting flux density of about 0.08 mjy for pulsars with periods greater than 50 ms and dms less than 200 @xmath2 pc . for comparison",
    ", the 610-mhz limiting flux density of the @xcite survey corresponds to a 1400-mhz limiting flux density of about 0.12 to 0.18 mjy assuming a spectral index of @xmath6 , typical for most pulsars @xcite .",
    "these limiting flux densities apply to a detection at the beam center and do not take into account variations of telescope gain over the surveyed region .",
    "the @xcite survey found two previously unknown pulsars , one of which is believed to be associated with the smc . in a separate search for pulsed emission from psr j0537@xmath16910 , a pulsar , psr j0535@xmath16935 , was serendipitously discovered .",
    "these discoveries brought the total number of known pulsars associated with the magellanic clouds to eight , seven of which are radio emitting , two of which are in the smc and six of which were discovered in radio surveys . in this paper",
    "we report on an extensive radio survey of both the lmc and smc for pulsars . like the @xcite survey of the smc , this survey used the multibeam receiver on the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "it has a comparable sensitivity to the @xcite survey but covers a wider area and is sensitive to higher dms .",
    "the survey was very successful with 14 pulsars discovered , 12 of which are believed to be in the magellanic clouds . in ",
    "2 we describe the survey and timing observations ,  3 gives details of the new discoveries and the implications of the results are discussed in  4 .",
    "the survey observations were made using the 13-beam multibeam receiver @xcite on the parkes 64-m radio telescope in several sessions between 2000 may and 2001 november .",
    "the 13 beams lie in a double - hexagon pattern around a central beam which allows complete sky coverage ( with adjacent beams overlapping at the half - power points ) with interleaved pointings .",
    "a brief description of the observing system follows ; for more details see @xcite .",
    "each beam has cryogenic receivers for two orthogonal polarizations centered at 1374 mhz . for each polarization ,",
    "the received 288-mhz band is split into 96 3-mhz channels .",
    "detected signals from each channel are summed in polarization pairs , high - pass filtered , integrated for 1 ms , one - bit sampled and written to digital linear tape for subsequent analysis .",
    "each pointing was observed for 8400 s , giving @xmath7 samples per observation .",
    "a total of 73 pointings ( 949 beams ) was observed for the smc and 136 pointings ( 1768 beams ) for the lmc .",
    "the distribution of these beams overlaid on images of the neutral hydrogen in the smc and lmc is shown in figure  [ fg : beams ] .    in most respects ,",
    "off - line processing followed the procedures outlined by @xcite and @xcite and was carried out on sun workstations at the atnf and at mcgill university .",
    "compared to the @xcite survey of the smc , a larger dm range was searched in the present survey .",
    "a total of 102 dms up to 277 @xmath2 pc were searched with 1-ms time resolution , a further 42 dms were then searched for each of 2  ms , 4  ms and 8  ms time resolution , with maximum dms of approximately 550 @xmath2 pc , 1100 @xmath2 pc and 2200 @xmath2 pc , respectively . for most periods and dms ,",
    "the sensitivity of this survey was comparable to that of @xcite , with a limiting flux density of about 0.08 mjy for an assumed 5% duty cycle .",
    "because of the four - times - longer sampling interval , the sensitivity for short - period pulsars ( @xmath8 ms ) is reduced compared to the earlier survey .",
    "these limiting flux densities apply to a pulsar at the center of the central beam of the multibeam receiver . in general",
    ", pulsars will lie some distance from the center of the nearest beam .",
    "furthermore , outer beams have a lower gain than the central beam .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the limiting mean flux density of the survey averaged over all positions within the tiled region to be approximately 0.12 mjy .",
    "the data analysis resulted in a large number of candidate pulsars which were graded according to signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and absence of interference .",
    "the better candidates were reobserved using a grid pattern of observations with the center beam of the multibeam system at the nominal position and @xmath9 north , south , east and west , typically for 3000  s per pointing .",
    "the data from these observations were searched over ranges of period and dm about the nominal values .",
    "detection of a pulsar signal in one or more pointings gave confirmation of the candidate and detection in two or more pointings also allowed determination of an improved position for the pulsar .",
    "following confirmation of a pulsar , a program of timing observations commenced in order to improve the position , period and dm , and to determine the period derivative .",
    "these timing observations used the center beam of the multibeam receiver and the same recording system as was used for the survey .",
    "the resulting data were folded at the topocentric period to form mean pulse profiles which were further analysed using the psrchive @xcite pulsar data analysis package to produce pulse times of arrival ( toas ) for each observation ( where there was a detectable pulse ) .",
    "these were analysed using tempo with the de200 solar - system ephemeris @xcite and a weighted fit .",
    "typically , the timing observations spanned 400  600 days with more than 20 observations per pulsar . in most cases ,",
    "dms were determined by splitting the observed 20-cm band into four subbands and measuring toas separately for each subband . in a few cases",
    "the pulsar was also detected using a 70-cm receiver which has a bandwidth of 32 mhz centered at 436 mhz ; combination of the 20-cm and 70-cm toas resulted in an improved dm for these pulsars .",
    "for each pulsar , several observations having high s / n were folded at two and three times the nominal period in order to uncover detection by the survey analysis software of a harmonic of the true pulse frequency  this procedure revealed two pulsars that had mis - identified periods from the survey analysis .",
    "the procedures described above resulted in the detection of 14 previously unknown pulsars , three toward the smc and 11 toward the lmc .",
    "table  [ tb : par ] lists the j2000 right ascension and declination obtained from the timing analysis , the dm and its `` z - component '' , dm @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the galactic latitude , which is useful for determining if the pulsar is within or outside the galactic electron layer , the mean flux density ( averaged over the pulse period ) at 1400 mhz and the pulse width at 50% of the peak amplitude . table  [ tb : ppar ] gives other parameters derived from the timing analysis , namely the barycentric pulse period , @xmath12 , its first time derivative , @xmath13 , the epoch of the period in modified julian days , the time - span of the data used in the timing fit , the number of toas fitted and the post - fit rms timing residual .",
    "estimated uncertainties given in parentheses after parameter values are twice the tempo rms errors and refer to the last quoted digit . mean flux densities were estimated from the area under grand average profiles formed by summing data from all timing observations ( whether or not the pulsar was detectable ) using the derived timing model to phase - align the profiles .",
    "psr j0451@xmath167 was detected just twice in two years of timing observations and a coherent timing solution was not possible .",
    "grid observations were also unsuccessful , so that the quoted position is that of the discovery beam and the uncertainties are the half - power beam radius . the period given in table  [ tb : ppar ]",
    "was obtained by splitting the best single observation into five parts of equal duration and obtaining toas for each part ; the quoted error includes a contribution from the position uncertainty .",
    "a limit on the period derivative was obtained by differencing the derived period and that from the discovery observation on mjd 51816 .",
    "the mean flux density was estimated by taking the value for the best detection ( on mjd 52817 ) and dividing by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total number of timing observations ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "if we assume pulsars are uniformly distributed through a roughly spherical volume for each cloud , the total integrated electron content across the cloud is twice the mean value or approximately 160 @xmath2 pc ( @xmath41 @xmath42 ) for the smc and 100 @xmath2 pc ( @xmath43 @xmath42 ) for the lmc .",
    "we also estimate the mean electron density in each cloud by computing the rms dispersion of the cloud dms , 48.2 @xmath2 pc and 26.8 @xmath2 pc for the smc and lmc respectively , and dividing this by the ( one - dimensional ) rms dispersion of the pulsar spatial coordinates in the right ascension and declination directions ( assuming a mean distance of 50 kpc and that the offsets in the two directions are independent ) , 1025 pc and 1480 pc respectively .",
    "this procedure gave mean electron densities of 0.047 @xmath2 for the smc and 0.018 @xmath2 for the lmc .",
    "we are somewhat limited by small - number statistics in the conclusions that we can draw from these results .",
    "for example , the relatively large values for the smc may simply be a consequence of psr j0131@xmath17310 lying behind a dense hii region .",
    "never - the - less , the results indicate that the mean free electron density in the magellanic clouds is similar to that in the disk of our galaxy , possibly with a somewhat higher value in the smc and a somewhat lower value in the lmc .",
    "these results show that the magellanic clouds have a much higher proportion of stars contributing to ionization of the interstellar medium compared to the galaxy , consistent with the much higher per - unit - mass star - formation rates in the clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the lack of an electron density model for the magellanic clouds , the relative distance uncertainties are small for the magellanic cloud pulsars compared to those in our galaxy .",
    "therefore magellanic cloud pulsars give a more reliable estimation of the luminosity and its dependence on various parameters than can be obtained from galactic pulsars .",
    "figure  [ fg : lum_distr ] shows the 1400 mhz radio luminosity for pulsars in the galactic disk and the magellanic cloud plotted against pulsar period ( left ) and characteristic age ( right ) .",
    "the approximately 1000 galactic pulsars plotted in these figures exclude apparently recycled pulsars , identified by having @xmath44  g , as well as pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "the magellanic cloud pulsars are typically of higher radio luminosity than galactic pulsars .",
    "this is simply a result of the limited sensitivity of radio surveys combined with the greater distance of the magellanic cloud pulsars .",
    "although the number of magellanic cloud pulsars remains relatively small , they do cover significant ranges of both pulse period and age .",
    "the maximum observed period is 1.82  s and more than half the ages are greater than @xmath45 years .",
    "figure  [ fg : lum_distr ] shows that there is little or no significant dependence of radio luminosity on either pulsar period or age .",
    "this remains true even if psr j0537@xmath16910 and psr j0540@xmath16919 , neither of which was discovered in radio surveys , are disregarded .",
    "indeed , if anything , there is a weak positive correlation of radio luminosity with characteristic age !",
    "this suggests that the emitted radio power is not greatly dependent on pulsar period or age and that other factors dominate the observed luminosity .",
    "it is worth noting that , assuming radiation into a beam of angular width equal to the observed pulse width , the radio luminosity is a tiny fraction , typically @xmath46 , of the spin - down luminosity .",
    "the true radio luminosity may be substantially underestimated if only the outer part of the radio beam sweeps across the earth .",
    "unfortunately , there is little known about the pulse polarization of the magellanic cloud pulsars , so no estimates of offsets of our viewing angle from the beam center are available .",
    "however , experience with galactic pulsars shows that , even when these data are available , our poor understanding of radio beam shapes precludes making reliable corrections for these offsets ( cf .",
    "the narrow and relatively simple pulse profiles observed for most of the pulsars suggests that the observed emission is core - dominated , but this remains to be confirmed by polarization and spectral measurements . as mentioned in  3 , the median duty cycle ( @xmath47 ) for pulsars detected in this survey , 0.015 , is considerably less than the median value for the galactic population , 0.029 ( 0.028 if millisecond pulsars are excluded ) .",
    "since the magellanic cloud pulsars are all of high radio luminosity , this might suggest a correlation between luminosity and duty cycle , but no such correlation exists in the known galactic population .",
    "it is more likely that the low median duty cycle is a selection effect resulting from the fact that the limiting flux density is proportional to @xmath48 for small @xmath47 .",
    "it is easier to detect pulsars of a given mean flux density if they have a small duty cycle .",
    "this effect is significant when a large fraction of the sample is close to the detection threshold .",
    "the two shortest - period and youngest known magellanic cloud pulsars were both first detected at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "both have low radio luminosities , with only an upper limit for psr j0537@xmath16910 .",
    "it is quite possible that the radio beam for both of these pulsars misses or largely misses the earth , implying that the x - ray beam either covers a wider range of pulsar latitude than the radio beam or is less patchy .",
    "figure  [ fg : lumfn ] shows the distribution of observed radio luminosities for galactic and magellanic cloud pulsars .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the effect of selection against low flux densities in radio pulsar surveys . for luminosities above about 30 mjy kpc@xmath49 for galactic pulsars and 300 mjy kpc@xmath49 for magellanic cloud pulsars ,",
    "the effect of selection is less and the distribution approximates the intrinsic luminosity function of pulsars , which in this plot of @xmath50 has a slope of about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although we are still limited by small - number statistics , there is no evidence that the magellanic cloud pulsars have a different luminosity function from their galactic counterparts .",
    "an extensive survey of the large and small magellanic clouds for radio pulsars using the parkes radio telescope at 1400 mhz has resulted in the discovery of 14 pulsars , 12 of which are believed to be associated with the clouds .",
    "the average limiting flux density of the survey was about 0.12 mjy .",
    "in general , the associated pulsars appear to be located in the more central regions of each cloud where there is significant hi emission .",
    "two long - period pulsars were discovered , one of which appears to be a very old pulsar located in the galactic halo ; the other is notable for its very strong implied surface dipole magnetic field .",
    "this survey brings the number of spin - powered pulsars believed to be associated with the magellanic clouds to 20 .",
    "mean free electron densities averaged over the volume of the clouds are similar to those in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "observed luminosities are at the high end of the luminosity function observed for galactic pulsars but consistent with it . despite the observed pulse periods and ages covering relatively wide ranges , there is little or no correlation of radio luminosity with either of these parameters",
    ".    it will be difficult to significantly improve on this survey with existing instrumentation as the required observation times are too long to be feasible .",
    "although searches for extra - galactic pulsars at relatively low frequencies with large radio telescopes such as arecibo may have some success , any major increase in the their number will most probably have to wait until the advent of instruments of much larger collecting area , for example , the proposed square kilometer array .",
    "we thank our colleagues for assistance , especially with the timing observations .",
