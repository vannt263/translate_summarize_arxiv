    "the generation of a large fermion mass like @xmath0 is an extremely difficult problem in theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking ( esb ) .",
    "for instance , in technicolor theories an extended technicolor ( etc ) interaction is required in order to obtain fermion masses .",
    "the interaction of the etc gauge bosons with fermions and technifermions gives rise to fermion masses through terms of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the etc gauge boson mass and @xmath3 is the technifermion condensate .",
    "thus , in order to generate the correct value of @xmath0 , the etc scale has to be of @xmath4 , which is uncomfortably low .",
    "several modifications of the dynamics within technicolor have been proposed in order to accommodate such a large fermion mass @xcite . on the other hand , in top - condensation models",
    ", the large top - quark mass is obtained from a @xmath5 arising as a consequence of a new gauge interaction , topcolor , which couples strongly to the top quark .",
    "topcolor generates four - fermion interactions of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 @xmath9 doublet and @xmath10 is the typical scale of the new interactions .",
    "if the coupling @xmath11 is strong enough the top condensation occurs .",
    "the top chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and a large @xmath0 is generated .",
    "this implies the presence of goldstone bosons .",
    "originally  @xcite , it was proposed that these were identified with the longitudinal components of the electroweak gauge bosons so that topcolor would also be fully responsible for esb . with the esb scale defined as @xmath12 ,",
    "the decay constant of these top - pions is given by the pagels - stokar formula @xmath13 with @xmath14 the number of colors . from ( [ pagstok ] )",
    "it can be seen that , in order for @xmath15 and @xmath0 to be close to the measured value , the topcolor scale @xmath10 has to be extremely large ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this translates into an acute fine - tuning of the coupling @xmath11 in ( [ etcmf ] ) , which has to be adjusted to the critical value with unnaturally high precision .",
    "one way to avoid this problem within topcolor models is to give up the idea that esb is fully driven by the @xmath17 condensate .",
    "for instance , a cutoff scale @xmath18 gives a non fine - tuned coupling ( a few percent above critical ) , but a top - pion decay constant of the order of @xmath19 , which gives only small masses to the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 . in this version of topcolor  @xcite , a separate mechanism must be invoked to generate most of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 masses .",
    "this is the case of topcolor - assisted technicolor .",
    "most of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as well as _ small _",
    "( @xmath24 ) quark masses come from the technicolor sector .",
    "thus a small portion of @xmath0 also comes from etc terms , but most of the top - quark mass is dynamically generated by the topcolor mechanism .",
    "the explicit etc quark mass terms for top and bottom turn the top - pions into massive pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "their masses can be estimated in the fermion loop approximation to be  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective value of the etc quark masses .",
    "although these are initially of the order of @xmath27 , the etc top - quark mass receives large radiative enhancements from the topcolor interactions @xcite . thus one can have top - pion masses in the range @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , then the top quark would primarily decay as @xmath30 .",
    "the current cdf measurement of @xmath31 implies @xmath32 at @xmath33 confidence level @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the topcolor enhancement to the etc top mass is enough to make @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of the top - pions ( @xmath35 ) is an essential ingredient in the topcolor scenario , regardless of the dynamics responsible for the esb sector and the other quark masses .",
    "the presence of other low - lying states depends on the details of the model .",
    "a topcolor model is greatly specified by choosing a mechanism of isospin breaking , which selects the top - quark direction for condensation , leaving the bottom quark unaffected . the complete anomaly - free fermion content is necessary in order to know the scalar spectrum of the model .",
    "these low lying states have , in most cases , masses well below the cutoff scale @xmath10 , which points at them as possibly the first signal for topcolor .",
    "in all models the topcolor group contains an @xmath36 which at an energy scale @xmath10 breaks down to ordinary @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 is assumed to interact strongly with the third generation quarks .",
    "after topcolor breaking there is , in addition to the massless gluons , an octet of massive colored vector particles : the top - gluons . at this stage , if the topcolor coupling is above critical we would have both @xmath39 and @xmath40 condensation . to avoid the latter ,",
    "the effective topcolor interaction must be isospin breaking .",
    "we describe two typical scenarios to implement this aspect of the theory .",
    "an effectively isospin breaking interaction is obtained by embedding two new @xmath41 interactions in the weak hypercharge group such that @xmath42 , with the @xmath43 strongly coupled to the third generation .",
    "this leaves an additional color - singlet massive vector boson , a @xmath44 .",
    "both the top - gluon and the @xmath44 have masses of order @xmath10 . after integrating out these heavy particles , the interesting effective four - fermion interactions that are induced have the form @xcite @xmath45 here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the @xmath50 and @xmath51 couplings respectively .",
    "the angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 characterize the embedding of the topcolor and the @xmath54 groups in @xmath37 and @xmath51 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath38 and @xmath43 couple strongly to the third generation translates into the conditions @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the criticality condition @xmath57 must be satisfied in order to obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "constraints on the top - gluon sector come from @xmath39 production , as well as @xmath39 and @xmath40 dijet mass distributions at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "this specific model is also constrained by the effects of the @xmath44 on low energy data , both at the @xmath21 pole @xcite and at low energies through fcnc @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to accommodate all these constraints with a topcolor scale @xmath60 and still not have a fine tuning problem .",
    "for instance , in the most general case , a @xmath61 top - gluon gives a topcolor coupling @xmath62 above its critical value .",
    "therefore , one can imagine a scenario where the topcolor gauge bosons are at the few-@xmath63 scale , making their direct detection difficult . in this scenario",
    "it is possible that the effects of topcolor dynamics will appear at lower energy scales due to the presence of a relatively light scalar spectrum",
    ".    the effective interactions of ( [ l_ffermi ] ) can be written in terms of two auxiliary scalar doublets @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "their couplings to quarks are given by @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at energies below @xmath10",
    "the auxiliary fields acquire kinetic terms , becoming physical degrees of freedom . with the properly renormalized fields @xmath69 the criticality conditions ( [ crit_con ] ) are equivalent to @xmath70 the @xmath64 doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) giving mass to the top quark through the coupling in ( [ phi_qks ] ) .",
    "it is of the form @xmath71 as mentioned earlier , the set of three top - pions acquires a mass from explicit small quark mass terms ( the etc masses in topcolor - assisted technicolor ) .",
    "there is also a scalar , the @xmath72 or top - higgs , which mass is estimated in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) approximation to be @xmath73 the second doublet is present as long as the topcolor interaction couples to @xmath74 , as is the case in ( [ l_ffermi ] ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath75 these states are deeply bound by the topcolor interactions and therefore can be light .",
    "their masses can be estimated once again within the njl approximation .",
    "for instance for @xmath76 and @xmath77 one has , for the neutral states @xcite , @xmath78 whereas the mass of the charged states is determined by the relation @xmath79 the couplings to quarks can be read off equation ( [ phi_qks ] ) . calculating the field renormalization constants @xmath80 to one loop and using ( [ pagstok ] ) ,",
    "the couplings are simply @xmath81 where @xmath0 is the dynamically generated top quark mass .",
    "this is a typical goldberger - treiman factor . recalling that in topcolor models we expect @xmath82 , we see that the coupling of the topcolor `` higgs '' sector to the top quark is considerably larger than that of the sm higgs boson",
    ". moreover , in models where the second doublet is present this couples to @xmath40 quarks with the same strength as @xmath83 couple to top .",
    "this implies that @xmath84 and @xmath85 decays are dominated by the @xmath86 final state .",
    "the existence of these relatively light scalar states strongly coupled to third generation quarks implies a very rich phenomenology . in what follows",
    "we analyze the implications of the scalar spectrum in the model described above .",
    "we discuss other alternatives in model building in the next section , with emphasis on the differences in the scalar spectrum and phenomenology .",
    "_ * top - pions : * _ as discussed earlier , these are the pseudo - goldstone bosons of the breaking of the top chiral symmetry .",
    "they couple to the third generation quarks as @xmath87 although their masses are lifted by the etc interactions , they can still play an important role in low energy observables such as as rare @xmath88 decay branching fractions and angular distributions  @xcite , as well as in electroweak precision observables at the @xmath21 pole like @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "top - pions do not have two - gauge - boson couplings , and thus single @xmath90 production must involve a triangle diagram . at hadron colliders",
    "they are mostly produced through the gluon - gluon-@xmath91 effective coupling induced by the top loop .",
    "for instance , the gluon - gluon fusion has a cross section larger than that of the s - channel production of the sm higgs boson by a factor of @xcite @xmath92 this enhancement is also present in the @xmath93 production in association with top quarks , or in any production mechanism involving the @xmath94 coupling .",
    "production at @xmath95 colliders is discussed in @xcite .    if @xmath96 the top - pion would be narrow ( @xmath97 ) . in models as",
    "the one presented above , where @xmath74 couples to to the strong @xmath38 interaction , instanton effects induce a coupling of @xmath93 to @xmath74 , which is not present in ( [ top_pi ] ) .",
    "this implies that , as long as the @xmath98 channel is not open , the dominant decay mode of the @xmath99 is to @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "also , and independently of the presence of instanton effects , there is a coupling of @xmath101 to @xmath102 given by ( [ top_pi ] ) times two powers of the @xmath103 mixing factor arising from the rotation of weak to mass quark eigenstates .",
    "however , in the present model the @xmath100 mode is expected to dominate .    _",
    "* top - higgs : * _ it corresponds to a loosely bound , cp even , @xmath104 state , coupling to the top quark with strength @xmath105 . in the njl approximation",
    "its mass is given by ( [ mthiggs ] ) , and therefore details of the non - perturbative dynamics are crucial to understand the decay modes and width of the @xmath72 .",
    "the top - higgs production is analogous to the @xmath93 case .",
    "the main difference between these two states is that @xmath72 couples to gauge boson pairs .",
    "these couplings are _ suppressed _ with respect to the case of a sm higgs by a factor of @xmath106 . however",
    ", if the @xmath107 channel is not open this would be the dominant decay mode .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath108 will be considerably smaller than the width of a sm higgs , whereas its production cross section will still be @xmath109 times larger . on the other hand , if @xmath110 the cross section is still the same but @xmath108 is @xmath109 _ larger _ than the width of the sm higgs of the same mass , so that @xmath72 could only be detected as an excess in the @xmath104 in a given channel .",
    "_ * the `` b - pions '' @xmath111 : * _ if these states are present ( i.e. if topcolor couples to @xmath74 ) they give potentially dangerous contributions to various low energy observables .",
    "their couplings to quarks are analogous to those in ( [ top_pi ] ) .",
    "the strongest constraint on a model containing these bound - states comes from @xmath112 mixing @xcite and implies the existence of large suppression factors in the quark mixing matrices  @xcite .",
    "a constraint independent of these details is the contribution to @xmath113 , the parameter measuring deviations from the sm @xmath114 parameter , due to the splitting between the neutral and charged states . as an illustration of the size of the effect , we plot @xmath115 in fig .  1 as a function of the mass of the neutral scalars and making use of the njl result ( [ bpi_pm ] ) for the mass splitting .",
    "the horizontal lines represent the @xmath116 c.l .",
    "interval obtained using @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "although the bound is tighter as @xmath118 increases , the b - pion splitting , always present in models with the additional @xmath41 s , is not in contradiction with electroweak precision measurements",
    ".    these states decay almost exclusively to @xmath40 pairs and they are extremely broad .",
    "their production proceeds in similar ways to that of @xmath72 and @xmath93 , with the important difference that the quark inside the triangle loop , the @xmath40 quark , is much lighter than @xmath119 which translates into an effective suppression of the amplitude from its `` hard '' value of @xmath81 .",
    "in addition to these low lying scalar states , the topcolor interactions in principle lead to the formation of heavier bound states .",
    "for instance , there will be a color singlet vector meson , the top - rho @xmath120 .",
    "however , @xmath120 not only couples to top - pions but also couples directly to third generation quarks and with strength proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , their mass can be estimated in the njl approximation to be of the order of the cutoff @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the influence of @xmath120 in low energy observables as well as in production of topcolor bound - states ( e.g. top - pions through vector meson dominance ) is largely suppressed .      in this type of topcolor models ,",
    "the strong @xmath38 group does not couple to @xmath74 , barring the possibility of a @xmath121 condensate .",
    "an example was presented in @xcite .",
    "the cancelation of anomalies requires the introduction of a new set of fermion fields , @xmath122 , with @xmath123 .",
    "there is a new interaction , @xmath124 .",
    "the novelty is that , depending on the choice of @xmath125 , light quarks might have to `` feel '' the strong topcolor interaction .",
    "for instance for @xmath126 the fermions must transform under @xmath127 as @xmath128 as advertised above , @xmath74 is not coupled to the strong topcolor interaction , whereas the cancelation of anomalies now requires that @xmath129 transforms as a triplet under @xmath38 .",
    "the quarks have standard @xmath51 assignments , whereas the @xmath130 have @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , they are @xmath132 singlets and therefore electrically neutral . if leptons are incorporated with their standard @xmath133 quantum numbers and as singlets under @xmath134 , all anomalies cancel .",
    "the @xmath135 forms a @xmath136 condensate which , in turn , breaks topcolor down to @xmath37 dynamically .",
    "the @xmath38 is chiral - critical and leads to the formation of a @xmath107 condensate and a dynamical @xmath0 .",
    "this breaks an @xmath137 global chiral symmetry and leads to the existence of a composite scalar field @xmath138 , quadruplet under @xmath139 .",
    "this can be decomposed into two doublets , one of which is just @xmath140 of section ii.a , containing @xmath72 and the top - pions .",
    "the additional doublet , @xmath141 , contains a set of three pseudo - scalars , the `` charm - top - pions '' or @xmath142 , as well as a `` charm - top - higgs '' @xmath143 : @xmath144 the masses of the charm - top - pions are generated by the same terms that break chiral symmetry explicitly and induce the top - pion masses , so they are expected to be of the same order as @xmath145 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath143 in the njl approximation is @xmath146 .",
    "the couplings to quarks are analogous to those of the top - pions and have the form @xcite @xmath147 important constraints on this scenario come from low energy observables . for instance , @xmath148 mixing is mediated by three - level s - channel exchange of @xmath143 and @xmath149 . however , the mixing amplitude is proportional to the product of the various unknown quark rotation factors entering the transformation from the weak to the mass eigen - basis for quarks @xcite .",
    "these factors depend on the sector of the theory responsible for light quark masses , e.g. etc .",
    "thus , charm mixing is a direct constraint on the light - quark mass matrices generated by this sector . on the other hand , charm - top - pion contributions to @xmath150 and @xmath151 are potentially large @xcite and independent of these details .",
    "the production of top - pions in this model is completely analogous to the model in the prevoius section .",
    "however , here the top - gluons do not couple to @xmath74 , so there will be no instanton induced @xmath40 quark mass term and therefore no @xmath152 decay mode .",
    "thus , if top - pions have a mass below the @xmath98 threshold , the neutral states will primarily decay to gluons .",
    "also and as we mentioned in the previous model , the @xmath101 decay mode is suppressed by two factors coming from the @xmath103 rotations . although these factors are not very constrained , naive estimates lead to values of @xmath153 that indicate that this mode is competitive with the gluon - gluon channel @xcite",
    ".    the production of charm - top - pions does not proceed via gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "production through the anomaly is no only suppressed by loop factors and couplings but also by ckm factors .",
    "the most efficient mechanism for single production of @xmath143 or @xmath154 is by emission off a top quark line , with this turning into a charm or strange quark for neutral and charged emission respectively .",
    "the multijet final state , e.g. @xmath155 for the neutral case , may be difficult to separate from the qcd background , especially given that these scalars are expected to be very broad .",
    "more detailed studies are necessary .",
    "charm - top - pions can also be pair produced , just like the top - pions and the top - higgs , via their model independent couplings to gauge bosons .",
    "however , as in the case of the previous section , these couplings are also suppressed by the ratio @xmath156 .",
    "it is possible to extend this model to the first family by just including the @xmath157 among the quarks strongly coupled to the topcolor interactions , in addition to @xmath158 .",
    "such topcolor models are partly motivated by the possibility of the existence of an excess of events at high energies in the cdf data for the inclusive jet cross section @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the consequences of a universally coupled top - gluon on the inclusive jet production were studied .",
    "it is possible to write down an anomaly free realization of this proposal .",
    "the only other modification needed to insure the cancelation of all anomalies is that now we need @xmath159 .",
    "thus , @xmath160 transforms as @xmath161 under @xmath162 , and the other fermions transform as before , with the exception of the @xmath130 that transform as quintuplets under @xmath163 .",
    "the global chiral symmetry broken by the dynamical top quark mass is now @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , besides the scalar content of the two previous models , there is a new scalar doublet , @xmath165 , the `` up - top - pions '' .",
    "their masses are very similar to those of @xmath72 and @xmath166 .",
    "their couplings to quarks can be read off ( [ ctp_toq ] ) , with the replacements @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "although these couplings imply an additional contribution to @xmath148 mixing , it is governed by the same product of up - quark rotation matrix elements , and therefore can be avoided by the same choice of mass matrices that suppressed the charm - top - pion contributions .",
    "there will also be new contributions to the hadronic @xmath21 width @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath169 and @xmath170 has the same features as that of the charm - top - pions . in both cases ,",
    "one expects these resonances to be very broad and a careful study is needed in order to establish their detectability in the various channels and in different environments .",
    "we have reviewed the main aspects of topcolor models and the constraints derived from the spectrum of low laying scalars and pseudo - scalars .",
    "a basic feature of all topcolor models is the existence of the loosely bound state @xmath72 and a triplet of top - pions @xmath171 .",
    "the latter is present in the physical spectrum in models where topcolor is not solely responsible for esb ( e.g. topcolor - assisted technicolor ) .",
    "although the production of @xmath72 shares several features with that of the sm higgs , it has a larger cross section and a very different width ( larger or smaller by @xmath109 depending on @xmath172 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observation of @xmath99 at hadron colliders is problematic given that its decay modes , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and gluon - gluon , are very hard to extract from the background .",
    "its production at lepton colliders is discussed in @xcite .",
    "specific realizations of topcolor tend to have additional , relatively light , scalars . given that these tend to be very broad objects , their detectability at various facilities requires a careful study , particularly at hadron colliders . considering that topcolor theories are still at relatively early model building stages ,",
    "the study of low energy signals of and constraints on the scalar spectrum in the various models will play a central role in determining what the dominant topcolor phenomenology will be in future experiments .",
