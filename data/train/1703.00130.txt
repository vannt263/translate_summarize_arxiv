    "<S> iii , the ps allowed by energy conservation for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 merge into a sphere - like geometry covering the whole fs , similar to that of weyl semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at high frequencies in this frequency domain , the optical conductivity shows a linear behavior , as already shown in previous studies @xcite .     for two different fermi energies of ( a ) @xmath70 and ( b ) @xmath71 . </S>",

    "<S> the optical conductivity for @xmath70 increases linearly with increasing @xmath41 , whereas that for @xmath71 exhibits an optical gap .    to address the difference in the low frequency behaviors , in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optical_conductivity_ef ] ( c ) and ( d ) we show the ps allowed by energy conservation corresponding to a low frequency range along with electron - hole pockets . for @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> , there is available ps for interband transitions consisting of two separate local domains located around the contact points between the electron and hole pockets . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : nlsms_optical_conductivity_notilt ] ) , we obtain the low frequency optical conductivity as @xmath76 where @xmath23 , @xmath77 is the location of graphene sheets sitting around the ps for interband transitions , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the presence of finite @xmath0 , the linear term dominates over the cubic one in the optical conductivity along the tilt direction , in contrast to the @xmath50 case [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nlsms_optical_conductivity_notilt ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( for @xmath81 case , see sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : asymptotic_forms ] in sm . )    for @xmath71 , there is no available ps for interband transitions at low frequencies because the electron pocket becomes large enough to cover the entire ps allowed by energy conservation , leading to an optical gap due to pauli blocking [ see fig .

    "<S> the optical gap persists up to the frequency where the ps allowed by energy conservation touches the boundary of the electron pocket . </S>",

    "<S> the electron ( hole ) pocket grows ( shrinks ) , because the number of electrons in the system increases . </S>",
    "<S> the imbalanced sizes of the electron and hole pockets lead to two more kinks compared with the @xmath50 case , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> similarly as in the @xmath50 case , we can obtain @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath90 is the frequency where the ps allowed by energy conservation changes its geometry from a torus to a sphere - like manifold .    </S>",
    "<S> the intraband contribution to optical conductivity gives rise to drude peak at low frequencies whose weight also inherits a nonanalytic density dependence from the geometry of the fs . </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion _  introducing spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) can gap out a nodal line and produce pairs of weyl points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such cases , at frequencies below the soc scale , the ps for interband transitions are spheres enclosing the weyl nodes and the conductivity will revert to linear frequency scaling known for weyl semimetals ( wsms ) . above the soc energy , however , </S>",
    "<S> the separated ps recovers a toroidal shape and this will have the characteristic dependence found in our work . recent calculations for wsms in the taas class indicate that these materials are weakly broken line node systems where the tilt scale dominates the soc scale @xcite . </S>",
