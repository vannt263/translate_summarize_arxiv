    "the study of reaction dynamics for the weakly bound nuclei offer ample opportunities to understand the underlying cluster structure effects .",
    "the measurements of elastic scattering and breakup observable in the experiments involving such nuclei show that the scattering and breakup probabilities are sensitive to the internal cluster structure .",
    "the reactions induced by stable weakly bound nuclei @xmath7li , have been explained quite successfully in terms of their predominant @xmath8 + d and @xmath8 + t cluster structures , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the cluster structure of @xmath0be which can be thought in terms of two @xmath8 particles and a neutron is not clear . within the three - body @xmath8 + @xmath8 + n picture of @xmath0be , no two constituents alone can form a bound system , a case analogous to that observed in some loosely bound unstable nuclei such as @xmath9he and @xmath10li , the so called borromean structure .",
    "the cluster structure of @xmath0be is not only of interest for studying the reaction dynamics of loosely bound nuclei but is of relevance to certain aspects of nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the nucleosynthesis via the reaction path @xmath8 + @xmath8 + @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath0be followed by @xmath0be(@xmath8 , @xmath11)@xmath13c @xcite is the most efficient path to bridge the stability gaps at a = 5 and a = 8 and knowledge of cluster structure of @xmath0be is vital for calculating the reaction rates . while a three body @xmath8 + @xmath8 + n cluster structure picture of the @xmath0be nucleus is more accurate one , the effective two - body @xmath8 + @xmath1he [ @xmath8 + ( @xmath8 + n ) ] @xcite or n + @xmath3be [ n + ( @xmath8 + @xmath8 ) ] @xcite cluster configuration can be used successfully in the calculations to explain the reaction dynamics .",
    "experimentally , several measurements of @xmath0be breakup @xcite have been performed to quantify the contribution of different cluster decay components in its low - lying excitation spectrum .",
    "there are many experimental evidences which show that the reaction dynamics of weakly bound nuclei are quite different from the tightly bound nuclei .",
    "there is a greater importance of the direct reactions , such as breakup or transfer , which may be enhanced owing to the low binding energies and the favourable q values for selected transfer channels .",
    "the coupling effects due to the low - lying resonances and non - resonant continuum arising due to small breakup threshold of a weakly bound nucleus are expected to be quite dominant .",
    "in addition , the coupling effect due to transfer channels are also found to be significant .",
    "the continuum discretized coupled channel ( cdcc ) formalism presents an effective method to take into account the coupling effects of breakup on elastic scattering and fusion process . in this method ,",
    "the coupled channels calculations are performed including the bound states of projectile and the continuum of its excitation which is discretized into a finite number of bins .",
    "further , the transfer mechanism can be studied through the coupled reaction channels ( crc ) formalism .",
    "the coupling effects are manifested in the behaviour of the equivalent dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) , which may provide a qualitative idea of major couplings that have significant effect on the reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "the nature of dpp arising due to the couplings of the breakup and transfer processes is not clear in case of weakly bound nuclei . in general , the breakup couplings are assumed to give repulsive behaviour for the real part of dpp . however , the opposite effect is observed at low energies where the breakup couplings have the dominant dipole contribution .",
    "similarly , while the transfer couplings are expected to give attractive couplings , but in case of positive q - value reactions , repulsive couplings have been found @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the couplings due to breakup also change their nature as a function of energy @xcite .    in a recent study ,",
    "we have thoroughly investigated @xcite two cluster configurations of @xmath0be namely , the @xmath1he+@xmath2he ( breakup threshold = 2.46 mev ) and the @xmath3be+n ( breakup threshold = 1.67 mev ) through high precision elastic scattering data at sub - coulomb barrier energies on @xmath14pb target .",
    "it was demonstrated that , at these sub - coulomb barrier only @xmath3be+n cluster structure of @xmath0be is able to explain the data satisfactorily .",
    "also , the effect of one neutron transfer was considered in these calculations and found to be dominant even at such sub - coulomb barrier energies .",
    "it is to be noted that , in the previous study by keeley _",
    "@xcite , the cluster structure of @xmath1he+@xmath2he for @xmath0be was used to explain the elastic scattering angular distribution data of the @xmath0be+ @xmath14pb system , at energies around and above the coulomb barrier .",
    "it was also pointed out that the coupling effect of one neutron stripping channel plays an important role .",
    "the competing coupling effects of one neutron transfer and the breakup channel for the @xmath0be projectile is crucial for the proper understanding of @xmath0be elastic scattering data for different target systems . motivated by these investigations ,",
    "we have attempted to validate the two models of @xmath0be for few other targets ( @xmath4si @xcite , @xmath5zn @xcite and @xmath6sm @xcite ) in different mass regions , where elastic scattering data is available around coulomb barrier energies .",
    "to study the effect of breakup and transfer couplings , we have carried out detailed coupled channels calculations .",
    "the breakup of the @xmath0be in the reactions for the @xmath0be+@xmath4si , @xmath5zn and @xmath6sm systems has been taken into account by performing the cdcc calculations .",
    "in addition to breakup ( bu ) couplings , the effect of one neutron transfer couplings have also been investigated through the coupled reaction channel ( crc ) calculations .",

    "the l = 2 component is taken in order to account for the reorientation of the highly deformed @xmath0be nucleus .",

    "is accounted by taking both the l = 0 and l = 2 components explicitly , the continuum states are calculated as purely l = 0 , 1 , 2 states .",
    "this approximation which omits some terms of the full orthogonal combinations is seemingly non - trivial .",
    "however , in addition to the ground state , the @xmath17 inelastic state at energy 2.43 mev and the @xmath18 resonance state at 6.38 mev are generated using the @xmath1he+@xmath2he cluster model .",

    "the effect of the breakup and transfer on the elastic scattering is evident from the difference between the uncoupled calculations and the results obtained from including all bu couplings and subsequently also including the transfer ( in the @xmath3be+n model ) .",

    "however , from the fig .",
    "[ thranomaly ] it is observed that the imaginary part of the potential shows an increase in strength at energies near the coulomb barrier indicating the presence of unusual threshold anomaly .",
    "a similar behaviour in the effective potential has been observed by the optical model analysis of measured data for the @xmath0be+@xmath14pb,@xmath35bi systems @xcite .",
    "the additional couplings arising due to transfer lead to an effective dpp , the real part of which is less attractive compared to that given by only bu couplings .",
    "while the real part of dpp given by the bu - tr couplings still remains attractive for the relatively heavy target system @xmath0be+@xmath6sm , it turns more repulsive for the light target system @xmath0be+@xmath4si .",
    "the @xmath0be+@xmath5zn system is an intermediate case , where the real dpp at r@xmath33 is small attractive due to only bu couplings and turns repulsive due to inclusion of transfer couplings .",
    "therefore , it seems that there is a continuous evolution in the behaviour of the real part of dpp from the attractive real for the @xmath0be+@xmath6sm system , to the case of light target system @xmath0be+@xmath4si , where this is repulsive .",
    "here we would like to remark that the extent of increase of the attractive real potential may be somewhat reduced if the contributions due to continuum couplings due to @xmath1he+@xmath2he model are also significant .",
