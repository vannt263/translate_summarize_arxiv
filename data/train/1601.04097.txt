    "one important aspect of this research effort is to answer the existence and uniqueness properties of a distributed control law ( and solution ) that can lead each individual agent within the network to a common state value , which constitutes the core of the ( multi - agent ) network consensus problem .    for several years",

    "so far , in existing literature , consensus methodologies have been widely explored for multi - agent _ linear _ dynamical systems in many important and ground - breaking studies ( @xcite - @xcite )",
    ". however , there exists some important studies which also investigate nonlinear consensus problems in multi agent systems . for example , bausso et al .",

    "based on this approach , there have been many results developed for consensus problems and its applications .",
