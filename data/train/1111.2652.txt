    "cluster algebras were introduced in  @xcite as a tool for studying total positivity and canonical bases in semisimple algebraic groups .",
    "they have since appeared in various fields , including teichmller theory , poisson geometry , quiver representations , lie theory , algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics . among the key open problems surrounding cluster algebras are various structural conjectures found in @xcite .",
    "( see section  [ conj sec ] for statements of some of these conjectures . )",
    "this paper continues a series of papers aimed at creating combinatorial models for cluster algebras within the context of coxeter groups and root systems , using in particular the machinery of sortable elements and cambrian ( semi)lattices .",
    "cambrian lattices were introduced in  @xcite as certain lattice quotients ( or alternately sublattices ) of the weak order on a finite coxeter group .",
    "conjectures in that paper , later proved in @xcite , established the relevance of cambrian lattices to coxeter - catalan combinatorics . in particular ,",
    "cambrian lattices are closely related to generalized associahedra , which serve as combinatorial models for cluster algebras of finite type @xcite .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction to coxeter - catalan combinatorics . ) in the process of proving the conjectures , sortable elements were defined in @xcite and shown in @xcite to provide a direct combinatorial realization of cambrian lattices .",
    "finally , in  @xcite , the combinatorial theory surrounding sortable elements was further developed and extended to arbitrary coxeter groups ( from the special case of finite coxeter groups ) .    in this paper , we construct cambrian combinatorial models for cluster algebras .",
    "the insights gained from our first direct constructions of cambrian models led to a general blueprint for building combinatorial / algebraic models .",
    "accordingly , we begin the paper by defining the notion of a * _ framework _ * for an exchange matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the matrix @xmath1 defines a cartan companion @xmath2 and thus a root system .",
    "the matrix @xmath1 also defines a bilinear form @xmath3 on the root space .",
    "in essence , a framework is a graph @xmath4 with two labelings : each pair @xmath5 consisting of a vertex contained in an edge is given a * _ label _ * @xmath6 and a * _ co - label _ * @xmath7 .",
    "these labels are vectors in the root space that are related by a positive scaling .",
    "they should be thought of as a root and its corresponding co - root , and indeed , in important special cases , this is the case .",
    "the labeling / co - labeling must satisfy certain conditions ; when it does , a detailed combinatorial model of the cluster algebra can be extracted from the framework .",
    "the following theorem summarizes how to recover combinatorial properties of a cluster algebra from a framework for it .",
    "the precise details are theorems  [ framework exchange ] and  [ framework principal ] .",

    "* the @xmath0-vectors of cluster variables in @xmath12 , with respect to the seed @xmath9 , are the fundamental - weight coordinates of the basis of the weight space that is dual to the basis @xmath15    conjecturally , the framework also contains information about denominator vectors , based on a new general conjecture relating denominator vectors to @xmath0-vectors : for acyclic @xmath1 , we define an explicit linear map with an easily computed inverse and conjecture ( as conjecture  [ nu conj ] ) that the map relates denominator vectors to @xmath0-vectors for cluster variables outside the initial seed . the conjecture is easily verified when @xmath1 is @xmath16 , and we prove the conjecture when @xmath1 is of finite cartan type ( i.e.  when the cartan companion of @xmath1 is of finite type ) .",
    "a framework is * _ complete _ * if @xmath4 is a regular graph of the correct degree , and a complete framework models the entire exchange graph of the cluster algebra .",
    "we define some other conditions on frameworks in section  [ global sec ] , including the notions of an * _ exact _ * framework and a * _ well - connected polyhedral _ * framework .",
    "when the framework is complete and exact , the graph @xmath4 is isomorphic to the exchange graph .",
    "when the framework is also polyhedral and well - connected , it defines a fan that coincides with the fan of @xmath0-vectors .",
    "the existence of a complete , exact and/or well - connected polyhedral framework for @xmath1 implies several of the conjectures from @xcite .",
    "see theorem  [ complete conj ] and corollaries  [ exact conj ] and  [ polyhedral conj ] for details .",
    "frameworks are not only a convenient way to create models of cluster algebras , but in fact they are , conjecturally , the _ only _ way to create models .",
    "this idea is made precise in theorem  [ t model ] and corollary  [ identity model ] , which state that , assuming some conjectures from @xcite , every cluster algebra defines a framework .",
    "the theorem and corollary , together with the recipes in theorem  [ framework summary ] for reading off combinatorial information from a framework imply that every model for principal coefficients and/or @xmath0-vectors and/or ( conjecturally ) denominator vectors _ is _ a framework .    comparing the method of determining @xmath0-vectors from a framework to the method of determining principal coefficients , we arrive ( corollary  [ nz cor ] ) at an insight that also recently appeared as the first assertion of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2 ) : assuming a certain conjecture from  @xcite , the matrix formed by @xmath0-vectors is the inverse of the matrix given by principal coefficients .    the main thrust of the project , however , is to give direct proofs of the structural conjectures by constructing explicit frameworks based on sortable elements and cambrian lattices , without relying on results from other approaches to cluster algebras . in a sense",
    "we can do this quite generally : for every acyclic @xmath1 , we construct a * _ cambrian framework _ * and prove that the framework is exact , polyhedral , and well - connected .",
    "the underlying graph is the cambrian ( semi)lattice , so that the vertices of the graph are the sortable elements .",
    "the labels are certain roots that can be read off combinatorially from the sortable elements , and the co - labels are the associated co - roots . in the cambrian framework",
    ", the @xmath0-vectors can also be read off combinatorially without having to compute a dual basis .",
    "( see theorem  [ camb nu g ] . )",
    "conjecturally , the denominator vectors can also be read off combinatorially , and this conjecture is already proven in the case where @xmath1 is of finite cartan type .    when @xmath1 is of finite cartan type , the cambrian framework is complete , and thus defines a combinatorial and polyhedral model for the entire exchange graph .",
    "furthermore , the existence and properties of the cambrian framework for @xmath1 of finite cartan type imply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  4.7 ) as well as conjecture  [ nu conj ] , described above .",
    "the cambrian framework also provides new proofs of many of the conjectures from @xcite for @xmath1 of finite cartan type .",
    "see theorem  [ finite type conj ] for details .    when @xmath1 is of infinite cartan type , the cambrian framework is not complete .",
    "the incompleteness of the cambrian framework is the result of a fundamental obstacle : every cone in the cambrian fan intersects the tits cone of the coxeter group associated to @xmath1 . but cones in the ( conjectural ) fan defined by @xmath0-vectors do not all intersect the tits cone . in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "the authors construct a complete framework for @xmath1 of affine cartan type and use it to prove many many of the conjectures from @xcite for such @xmath1 . in another forthcoming paper , the second author and hugh thomas construct a complete framework for an arbitrary skew - symmetric exchange matrix @xmath1 .",
    "their framework is constructed from the representation theory of quivers .",
    "we conclude this introduction with two remarks about the key features of frameworks . as indicated above",
    ", the labels on a framework are essentially the columns of the bottom halves of principal - coefficients extended exchange matrices .",
    "thus , passing from vertex to vertex , the labels need to change in a way that amounts to matrix mutation .",
    "the mutation relation is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 5.9 ) ) , assuming one of the conjectures from @xcite .",
    "the relation depends , of course , on the top halves of the extended exchange matrices , i.e.  the exchange matrices .",
    "what is missing from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 5.9 ) ) is the insight that the exchange matrices themselves are determined from the labels , as described in theorem  [ framework summary ] .",
    "thus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 5.9 ) ) is replaced by a self - contained mutation rule in terms only of the labels .",
    "this rule is called the * _ transition condition _ * , and is the most important feature of the notion of a framework .",
    "in important cases , all of the labels are real roots , the co - labels are the corresponding co - roots , and the transition condition can be replaced by the * _ reflection condition_*. this condition says when @xmath17 and @xmath11 are connected by an edge and @xmath12 is the reflection associated to @xmath6 , each label on @xmath17 is either identical to a label on @xmath11 , or is obtained from a label on @xmath11 by the action of @xmath12 .",
    "the reflection condition was discovered in connection with combinatorial / polyhedral investigations of cambrian fans .",
    "another technical feature of frameworks that should not be overlooked is the use of root and co - root lattices ( and thus weight and co - weight lattices ) to handle the possible absence of skew - symmetry in @xmath1 . simply by placing vectors in the correct lattice ( i.e.  deciding whether to write the prefix `` co '' ) ,",
    "the difficulties caused by asymmetric @xmath1 completely disappear from the general theory of frameworks .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the purpose of roots and co - roots , etc .  in handling asymmetric cartan matrices .",
    "given the fact that a cambrian model exists for every acyclic @xmath1 , based on the cartan companion @xmath2 , this analogy is hardly accidental .",
    "in this section , we define the general notion of a framework and a special kind of framework called a reflection framework .      the exchange matrix @xmath18 $ ] associated to a cluster algebra is a skew - symmetrizable integer matrix , with rows and columns indexed by a set  @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "that means that there exists a positive real - valued function  @xmath21 on @xmath19 such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the matrix with diagonal entries @xmath24 and off - diagonal entries @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath2 is a symmetrizable generalized cartan matrix in the sense of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2.2 ) ) , called the * _ cartan companion _ * of @xmath1 . in particular , @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a real vector space of dimension @xmath30 with a basis @xmath31 and let @xmath32 be the dual vector space .",

    "we will sometimes refer to edges of size @xmath44 as * _ half - edges _ * and to edges of size @xmath24 as * _ full edges_*. half - edges should not be confused with `` self - edges '' or `` loops , '' i.e.  edges that connect a vertex to itself . in this paper , all quasi - graphs will be * _ simple _ * , meaning that no two edges connect the same pair of vertices , and that every edge of size two connects two distinct vertices . the * _ degree _ * of a vertex in a simple quasi - graph is the total number of edges ( including half - edges ) incident to that vertex , and the quasi - graph is * _ regular of degree @xmath30 _ * if every vertex has degree  @xmath30 .",
