    "when two bodies are in a mean motion resonance , their orbital periods are close to a ratio of two integers , which stabilizes the system in many cases .",
    "the laplace 4:2:1 resonance among the galilean satellites and the 3:2 resonances between neptune and trans  neptunian objects ( tnos ) are well  known examples in the solar system .",
    "more than 30 exoplanet systems also include confirmed planets exhibiting mean motion resonances .",
    "in addition , _ kepler _ has detected a large number of planet pairs near mean motion resonances ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , although they are not necessarily in resonances .",
    "many exoplanets are not near mean motion resonances ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , according to @xcite , such non resonant configurations can be established through orbit crossing among the planets after they are captured in mutual mean motion resonances .",
    "thus , mean motion resonances may have played an important role in the planet formation process .    to date",
    ", mean motion resonances have been studied from many perspectives ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "resonant configurations are thought to arise primarily from convergent migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several efforts have been made to derive a critical differential ( relative ) migration timescale @xmath1 above which mean motion resonances can be formed .",
    "@xcite analytically studied the restricted three ",
    "body problem with adiabatic migrating bodies , where the relative migration timescale is much longer than the resonant libration timescale .",
    "in contrast , recent studies have adopted numerical methods .",
    "one approach is to perform direct _",
    "n_body calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which take a direct summation of the mutual interaction between the bodies .",
    "another approach uses the hamiltonian model ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , where the canonical equations of the hamiltonian are solved numerically with some approximations .",
    "these studies examine the dependence of the critical migration timescale on the mass but consider the restricted three  body problem with a massive planet and a massless test particle . @xcite",
    "performed direct _",
    "n_body calculations with equal  mass planets .",
    "however , because their goal was to specify the origin of individual systems , the planetary mass was not usually treated as a parameter .",
    "our main aim is to derive an empirical formula for the critical migration timescale of capture into first ",
    "order @xmath2 mean motion resonances by performing direct _ n_body simulations .",
    "we handle the physical variables ( e.g. , mass and damping timescales ) as parameters and vary them over wide ranges . in this way , the dependences of the critical migration timescale on the parameters can be obtained .",
    "although the equal  mass case is of primary importance for the study of observed exoplanets in resonances , previous general studies , which are not restricted to particular systems , have not considered this situation ; therefore , we examine the case of equal  mass bodies .",
    "captures into 2:1 resonances , which are the outermost first  order resonances , are extensively studied in this paper ; in addition , more closely spaced commensurabilities ( e.g. , 3:2 and 4:3 ) are also examined . from the empirical formula based on our numerical results ,",
    "we try to constrain the origin of the orbital architecture of planetary systems exhibiting commensurabilities .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe the numerical methods ; in section  [ sec : results ] , we present and summarize the results of _ n_body simulations . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we derive the mass dependence of the critical migration time , and in section  [ sec : compare ] , we compare our results with those of previous studies . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we apply these results to systems with resonances and discuss their origin , and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we offer our conclusion .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] presents the calculation model considered in this work .",
    "initially , two planets with masses of @xmath3 ( inner body ) and @xmath4 ( outer body ) are placed at semimajor axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the initial eccentricity of these bodies is set to @xmath7 , and their inclination is also set to about @xmath7 in radian . damping forces",
    "are applied to the bodies that damp the eccentricity and semimajor axis on timescales of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we apply the @xmath10damping force only to one body ( mostly to the outer body ) ; therefore , @xmath9 is interpreted as the timescale of differential migration between the bodies .",
    "the initial locations are adopted to be separated from the resonance @xmath11^{2/3}$ ] ; namely , @xmath12 for 2:1 resonance , and for other closer resonances ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) the orbits are set just inside the @xmath14 resonance @xmath15^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "thus , when @xmath8 is much shorter than @xmath9 , the eccentricity is negligibly small at the resonant encounter .",
    "the equation of motion for planet 2 is @xmath16 where the first term on the right  hand side is the gravitational force of the central star , the second term is the mutual gravity between the bodies , and the third and fourth are the indirect terms . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the specific forces for @xmath19damping and @xmath10damping , respectively ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the orbits are directly integrated with the fourth  order hermite scheme @xcite over about 0.2 times the migration timescale , which means that although the long  term stability is not exmined in this study , a temporary capture with a capture duration of less than about 0.1 times the migration timescale can be excluded .    in order to derive critical values of @xmath9 for resonance capture ,",
    "numerical simuations are performed with different @xmath9 .",
    "the sampling interval of @xmath9 adopted in this study is usually 0.2 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "we treat the masses ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , the @xmath19damping timescales ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , and the initial eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) as parameters . for a fiducial model ,",

    "hereafter , we usually use @xmath47 and present @xmath3 and @xmath4 in units of earth mass for simplicity . in this paper , we mostly present results assuming @xmath48 because we find that the condition for capture into resonance is approximately expressed by the mass of the larger body , which will be shown in section  [ sec : internal_resonance ] .",
    "we estimate the critical migration timescale in a manner similar to that of @xcite .",
    "orbital integrations of two planets are performed with various parameters to determine whether the planets are captured into 2:1 mean motion resonances .",

    "squares fit to the data ( solid line ) , we specify @xmath1 and @xmath57 .",
    "the capture probability increases sharply at @xmath58 , which means that the critical migration time @xmath1 can be estimated without introducing large errors @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ta_p_fiducial](b ) presents the results for an initial eccentricity of @xmath60 . in this case , the eccentricity is 0.01 at the resonant encounter because the inner body does not undergo eccentricity damping .",
    "in contrast to low @xmath7 , high eccentricities reduce @xmath54 at @xmath61  @xmath62 , and",
    "@xmath54 gradually increases with @xmath9 @xmath63 .",
    "this broadening of the capture probability curve at higher eccentricity is also seen in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the critical migration timescale can be sharply defined except when the eccentricity is not small @xmath64 at the resonant encounter . in the following subsections ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 is explicitly described only when the transition is not sharp enough .",
    "the eccentricity dependence of @xmath54 is summarized in section  [ sec : eini ] .",
    "we performed @xmath65 runs for each set of parameters ( @xmath66 runs in total ) .",

    "the eccentricity of the inner body is @xmath76 at the resonant encounter and the capture probability curve is broadened ( @xmath77@xmath78 ) .",
    "this survey reveals two features .",
    "first , all of the @xmath1 values except that for @xmath79 are within about a factor of two of each other .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 depends weakly on @xmath80 and @xmath7 , which can be seen in the following subsections in more detail .",
    "second , all the cases exhibit a similar power  law dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 .",
    "the gradients are calculated for each case by least ",
    "squares fits , and we obtain a typical power index approximately equal to @xmath0 .",
    "a physical interpretation for this dependence is discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "next , we explore the effect of varying @xmath81 note that the dependence can be seen more clearly when @xmath31 is used instead of @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : m2_ta ] shows @xmath1 as a function of @xmath81 open squares represent the fiducial case .",
    "filled squares , open circles , filled circles , and open triangles show the results for @xmath82 , and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "same as the previous subsection , the capture probability curve is not sharp for @xmath75 ( @xmath83@xmath84 ) .    we find that if @xmath85 @xmath1 is independent of @xmath31 ; therefore , the restricted three ",
    "body approximation is valid for this condition .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 for @xmath86 and the value for small @xmath31 is found to be a factor of about 10 .",
    "thus , although the restricted three  body approach can not provide an accurate prediction of @xmath1 for bodies with comparable masses , it would be possible to roughly derive @xmath1 to an accuracy of a factor of 10 .",
    "see also discussions in sections  [ sec : internal_resonance ] and [ sec : compare ] for the reason for the difference .",
    "note that we consider only the migration of the outer planet .",
    "because migration speed depends on planetary mass , the inner planet s migration is not negligible , especially for @xmath87 .",
    "however , if we apply the differential migration speed instead of the migration speed of the outer planet , the critical migration timescales we obtain are valid even considering the migration of both planets .",
    "figure  [ fig : te1_ta ] shows the results for various eccentricity  damping timescales for the inner ( larger ) planet , @xmath20 .",
    "again , the open squares represent the fiducial case .",
    "filled squares , open circles , filled circles , and open triangles show the results for @xmath88 , and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "the rightmost points on the horizontal axis are the cases without eccentricity damping . for @xmath75 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the transition from a capture probability of zero to one is not very sharp ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "there is no systematic change in @xmath1 with @xmath89 even when @xmath20 is varied by more than four orders of magnitude , the differences in @xmath1 lie within a factor of two or three .",
    "figure  [ fig : te2_ta ] shows the results for various eccentricity  damping timescales for the outer ( smaller ) planet , @xmath21 .",
    "open squares represent the fiducial case .",
    "filled squares , open circles , filled circles , and open triangles are the results for @xmath90 , and @xmath70 respectively . for @xmath75 , the transition in the capture protability is not sharp ( @xmath77@xmath91 ) .",
    "we also do not see any clear trends in @xmath92 although the case with @xmath93 ( open triangles ) shows a slight variation , it still remains within a factor of a few .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : e_ta ] shows the results for various initial eccentricities @xmath7 .",
    "open squares represent the fiducial case .",
    "filled squares , open circles , filled circles , and open triangles are the results for @xmath90 , and @xmath94 respectively . when the eccentricity is not small @xmath64 at the resonant encounter , in other words , when @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the capture probability curve is not sharp the same as before .",
    "again , no clear trends in @xmath1 with @xmath7 are recognized .",
    "note that , for @xmath97 and @xmath79 ( open circles ) and for @xmath98 ( open triangles ) , @xmath1 can not be determined to have particular values .",
    "because the eccentricity of the smaller body @xmath4 at a resonant encounter is relatively large , adequate resonant capture does not occur even for long @xmath9 ; the capture probability does not exceed about 0.3 . except for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the dependence is reasonably weak .",
    "several of these features are in agreement with previous studies , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : compare ] .",
    "the critical migration timescales derived in the previous subsections are summarized as follows : @xmath99 where the dependence on the stellar mass @xmath44 is included .",
    "as shown in the results , @xmath1 can differ by a factor of two or three .",
    "although we assume that the inner body is more massive than the outer body @xmath100 , the results are almost the same when the outer one is more massive , which will be seen in section  [ sec : internal_resonance ] .",
    "the formula is valid if the eccentricities of the smaller planets at a resonant encounter are much smaller than 0.1 .",
    "the capture condition for 2:1 mean motion resonances was examined above .",
    "we performed additional simulations to evaluate the critical migration timescale for closely spaced first ",
    "order resonances ( e.g. , 3:2 and 4:3 ) because several exoplanet systems have such commensurabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : p_ta ] shows the critical migration timescales for @xmath2 resonances ( @xmath101 ) obtained by numerical simulations . here , we define @xmath102a_1,\\ ] ] which roughly corresponds to the orbital separation from the inner planet to the outer planet in the mean motion resonance .",
    "open squares represent the results for @xmath103 , whereas filled squares represent those for equal  mass bodies ( @xmath86 ) . in each case",
    ", the other parameters are set to the fiducial values @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the critical migration time decreases with decreasing separation .",
    "the critical migration timescale for equal  mass bodies ( @xmath105 ) is always shorter than that with bodies that have a high mass ratio ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath1 is larger at 2:1 resonances than at closely spaced resonances .",
    "this is presumably because the strength of the 2:1 external resonance , where `` external '' means that the inner body is the dominant body , is significantly weakened by indirect terms in the disturbing function , which will also be discussed in section  [ sec : internal_resonance ] .",
    "cccccc mass ratio & 2:1 & 3:2 & 4:3 & 5:4 & 6:5 + @xmath107 & @xmath108 & @xmath109 & @xmath110 & @xmath111 & @xmath111 + @xmath112 & @xmath113 & @xmath114 & @xmath109 & @xmath110 & @xmath110 [ tbl : fitting ]    the combined results from the above surveys are plotted in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] .",
    "the solid lines indicate the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance as a function of @xmath3 , which is summarized in equation  ( [ eq : ta_crit ] ) .",
    "squares , triangles , and inverted triangles are the numerical results for the 3:2 , 4:3 , and 5:4 resonances , respectively . from the results , the critical migration timescale is described as @xmath115 where @xmath116 depends on @xmath117 and the resonant commensurability .",
    "we derive the @xmath116 values from the fitting of the results and summarize @xmath116 in table  [ tbl : fitting ] . note that although @xmath116 should depend on commensurability , the values are the same between the 5:4 and 6:5 resonances , which suggests that the difference is within the minimum interval of @xmath9 that we set for our investigation .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] represent fitting results for equal  mass cases @xmath118 .",
    "although the approximate fits for closer resonances are considered to be correct within a factor of a few , they should be treated with some caution .",
    "we observe that when @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the bodies undergo close encounters before being captured into resonances ; therefore , the bodies do not settle into stable resonant orbits , as indicated by the open symbols in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] .",
    "according to the analysis of the hill stability by @xcite , dynamical stability is almost guaranteed if @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the mutual hill radius .",
    "note that if the orbital separation is within a few tens of percent beyond the critical hill separation , hill ",
    "stable planetary systems may manifest lagrange instability when the outer planet escapes to infinity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is no analytical criteria that describe lagrange stability , and additional numerical simulation is required to determine whether the system is lagrange stable or not .",
    "however , @xcite found that the hill stable condition is a good predictor of lagrange stability .",
    "the hill stable condition is rewritten as @xmath123 ^ 3 m_*. \\label{eq : critical_mass}\\ ] ] the critical masses for equal  mass bodies assuming @xmath47 are plotted with crosses connected with by a solid line in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] . if the mass of the body is larger than the critical mass , the system becomes hill unstable , which is consistent with our results that exhibit close encounters ( open symbols ) .",
    "note that even if @xmath124 , the orbit in a resonance can become stable for specific orbital arguments ( some examples are provided in section  [ sec : constraints ] ) .",
    "this criterion for the instability is a rough estimate , and long  term orbital integration can reveal the instability time of planets in closely spaced mean motion resonances .",
    "so far , we have carried out simulations in the cases where the inner body is more massive or equal to the outer body . in order to evaluate the difference in @xmath1 between the internal and external resonances , additional simulations for outer massive body",
    "are performed .",
    "assuming @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath26 , the critical migration timescales are determined for 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 , 5:4 , and 6:5 resonances , which are plotted in figure  [ fig : p_ta ] with crosses .",
    "we find that no significant difference between the internal and external resonances ; in fact , it lies within a factor of two .",
    "therefore , as stated in the last sentence of section  [ sec : model ] , if the outer body is larger than the inner body , we apply the mass of the larger body to @xmath3 ; equation  ( [ eq : ta_gen ] ) is then valid .",
    "although the difference is not significant , we see a decrease in @xmath1 at the 2:1 internal resonance , which means that the 2:1 internal resonance is stronger than the 2:1 external resonance . this tendency can be understood in terms of contributions of each term in the disturbing function . for the 2:1 external resonance , the contribution of the direct term",
    "is diminished by the indirect term , leading to weakening the strength of the resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one indicator of the strength of the resonance is @xmath129 in the work of @xcite ( see table  1 in their work for each value ) , where the strength of resonance decreases with increasing @xmath129 .",
    "we see that @xmath129 for the 2:1 external resonance is large .",
    "the fact that the 2:1 internal resonance is stronger than the 2:1 external resonance would also partially explain the decrease in @xmath130 for equal  mass bodies in figures  [ fig : m2_ta ] and [ fig : p_ta ] although this can not account for the entire change .",
    "we also see in figure  [ fig : p_ta ] that internal resonances are slightly weaker than external resonances for closely spaced resonances ( e.g. , 3:2 ) , which is consistent with figure  11 in the work of @xcite .",
    "we discuss the numerical results using analytical arguments . through numerical investigations ,",
    "we find that the critical migration timescale shows a power  law behavior , @xmath131 , which was also seen in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this tendency can be estimated using a simple pendulum model @xcite ; the following expressions describe the orbital properties of a massless particle that is in a mean motion resonance .",
    "note that these expressions are for the internal resonance ; however , those for the external resonance are almost the same .",
    "for the circular restricted problem , where the massless test particle is in a first ",
    "order @xmath2 resonance with a body with mass of @xmath132 , the maximum width of libration is given by @xmath133^{1/2 } a , \\label{eq : delta_res}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the excited eccentricity due to resonant perturbation , and @xmath135 and @xmath10 are the mean motion and semimajor axis of the test particle , respectively .",
    "the constant arising from the resonant term of the disturbing function is @xmath136 where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 are the ratio of semimajor axis of the inner body to that of the outer body , the laplace coefficient , and the derivative operator , respectively . for the first  order resonance , @xmath139 is always negative .",
    "the libration timescale is derived as @xmath140 then the excited eccentricity during the resonant passage is approximated using an adiabatic invariant as @xmath141 as in @xcite . substituting this equation into equations  ( [ eq : delta_res ] ) and ( [ eq : t_lib ] ) , we obtain @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 comparing the libration timescale @xmath145 and the migration timescale through the resonant width @xmath146 , where @xmath147 we determine that the critical migration timescale can be roughly given by @xmath148 we confirm the power ",
    "law dependence on the mass .",
    "in addition , given that @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 @xcite , @xmath1 for an earth  mass body is @xmath152 .",
    "these estimates are roughly consistent with our numerical results ; note , however , that they are only order  of  magnitude estimates assuming the restricted problem . the contribution from the variation in the longitude of the pericenter @xmath153",
    "is also neglected .",
    "we here discuss our results by comparing with previous studies .",
    "first , our results for two bodies that have a high mass ratio can be compared to the works that consider the restricted problem ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that several features in figure  [ fig : e_ta ] , in which the dependence of @xmath1 on the eccentricity is investigated , are in agreement with the results of @xcite ( figure  2 in their paper ) as follows .",
    "@xcite showed that when the generalized momentum is small enough , which corresponds to small @xmath19 , the capture probability curve is steep and @xmath1 hardly depends on @xmath19 . in figure",
    "[ fig : e_ta ] , we observe that @xmath1 is well  defined and almost independent of @xmath19 when @xmath19 at the resonant encounter is small ( @xmath154 for @xmath155 ) . in this case , the value of @xmath1 is also comparable to that derived by @xcite ; that is , their estimate for @xmath1 is @xmath156 for @xmath155 .",
    "we also see another feature of steepening dependence on @xmath19 at higher @xmath19 . according to @xcite",
    ", @xmath1 tends to sensitively depend on @xmath19 when @xmath19 is larger than @xmath157 and @xmath158 for @xmath155 and @xmath159 , respectively , which are seen in figure  [ fig : e_ta ] in the models of @xmath128 and @xmath160 .",
    "the other feature is that the capture probability has a cutoff at high eccentricity and never exceeds about 0.3 in the case of @xmath128 . in our results ,",
    "the cutoff eccentricity is @xmath161 , which quantitatively reproduces the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , several similar features are observed even in the results for equal  mass bodies ; namely , the weak dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath19 and the existence of the cutoff in the capture probability at high @xmath19 , which were expected from the previous study @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the values of @xmath1 differ by a factor of 10 between the restricted problem and the unrestricted problem . even if we consider the difference between the internal resonance and the unrestricted problem , there is at least a factor of a few difference in @xmath1",
    "special care would have to be taken when one quantitatively discuss the critical migration timescale for equal  mass bodies .",
    "several properties observed in our simulations were also seen in a dynamical study by @xcite .",
    "figure  2 of @xcite indicates the excluded resonant regions for the hd  200964 system ; figure  2(a ) shows their results for two planets of comparable mass , whereas figure  2(c ) shows the case where one body is a test particle .",
    "they found that the allowed region for the comparable  mass case is wider than that for the zero  mass particle , which suggests that planets with comparable masses are more easily captured into mean motion resonances . in our model , we find that the critical migration timescale for equal  mass planets is shorter than that for systems with high mass ratios .",
    "in addition , we also see a weak dependence of the critical migration timescale on the @xmath19damping timescales .",
    "this tendency is also seen in figure  4 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical expression for the eccentricity of the outer planet captured into a resonance .",
    "the equilibrium eccentricity is attained by balancing pumping due to resonant effects with damping caused by migration , as described by equation  ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that our numerical results are consistent with this analytical formula except for rapid migration @xmath162 and equal  mass bodies .",
    "the results given in section  [ sec : results ] can be used to constrain the history of systems in mean motion resonances and their formation scenarios . in this section ,",

    "table  [ tbl : exoplanets ] lists the orbital properties of the confirmed planets that could be in first  order resonances .",
    "the fourth and fifth columns show the masses and semimajor axes of the planets , respectively ; the sixth and seventh columns show the resonant properties .",
    "for example , the third row indicates that gliese  876  c could be in a 2:1 resonance with planet b , where the period ratio of these planets is 2.03 .",
    "the data are taken from the open exoplanet catalogue .",
    "note that many systems listed have ratios more distant from commensurability than the 1% used to classify resonant captures in our simulations .",
    "although the period ratios are close to commensurate values , not all of the planets necessarily lie in mean motion resonances .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] , which indicate the critical migration speeds , are the same as in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] . for the resonant  pair exoplanets listed in table  [ tbl : exoplanets ] , the critical migration timescale , plotted as open circles ,",
    "is obtained from their resonant commensurability and the mass ratio between the smaller and larger bodies ( @xmath163 or not ) as a function of the larger planet mass .",
    "all pairs except for the pair of gliese  876 b and e have roughly equal masses @xmath164 .",
    "the outer planet migration timescale must be longer than the critical migration time for capture into mean motion resonance to occur .",
    "we obtained the critical migration timescale in section  [ sec : results ] while ignoring the migration of inner planets .",
    "if the inner planets also migrate inward , the differential ( or relative ) migration speed between the inner and outer planets should be applied to the critical migration speed .",
    "using figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] , we can place some constraints on the differential migration speeds that the exoplanets used to have .",
    "note that in the following discussions , we introduce several assumptions : ( i ) planets formed widely separated from the 2:1 resonance .",
    "( ii ) the masses of planets do not evolve after the onset of migration .",
    "( iii ) migration is smooth and not subjected to stochastic torques .",
    "( iv ) the eccentricities of planets are low and hence the transition from certain capture to certain failure is well  defined .",
    "( v ) once captured in resonance , planets do not subsequently escape from the resonance .",
    "the 2:1 mean motion resonance is the outermost first ",
    "order mean motion resonance .",
    "the capture probability for the outer , higher  order mean motion resonance is very low .",
    "therefore , if a system has a 2:1 commensurability , the differential migration speed would have been slower than that estimated from the critical migration time .",
    "if a system has a 3:2 commensurability , the outer planet passed through the 2:1 mean motion resonance because of the high migration speed and was captured into the 3:2 mean motion resonance ; thus , the differential migration speeds is slower than the critical migration speed for the 3:2 mean motion resonance but faster than that for the 2:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "we can constrain the differential migration speed for capture in the other mean motion resonances in a similar manner .",
    "the pairs of exoplanets in the closely spaced mean motion resonances are expected to have migrated at significantly high speed .",
    "note that if two planets in a mean motion resonance formed with a small orbital separation , they may have been captured into closely spaced resonances under slow migration .",
    "in addition , if several planets simultaneously exhibit migration as a resonant convoy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) rather than the single outer planet migrating inward , the critical migration timescale can be somewhat longer than that derived in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "nonetheless , our approach provides useful constraints on formation models without the need for further dynamical analyses and calculations for individual systems .",
    "although the number of observed resonant exoplanets is too small to support a statistical discussion , we see in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] that there is a general trend toward a decrease in the number of systems in closely spaced resonances with increasing mass .",
    "this trend can be understood in terms of the short critical migration timescale for capture into 2:1 resonances with high  mass planets ; 1000earth  mass planets can capture bodies into 2:1 resonances even if the migration timescale is quite short @xmath165 .    as stated in section  [ sec : closer_resonances ] , it is predicted that pairs with orbital separations smaller than @xmath166 hill radii can be hill unstable , and such configurations are rare .",
    "we note that the hill stability criterion , more properly bodies should be lagrange stable , gives only a sufficient condition for stability ; thus , if the planets are in mean motion resonances , the system can become stable .",
    "however , they should experience a configuration where planets are not near resonances at some point during migration phase ; therefore , it is possible that such planets undergo close encounters and are scattered away from the system .",
    "we find that almost all the pairs have separations larger than @xmath167 ; however , there are several exceptions .",
    "we discuss these systems in section  [ sec : small_separation ] .",
    "on the other hand , several pairs have separations larger than @xmath168 hill radii , which is the typical orbital separation of planets formed via the oligarchic growth phase @xcite .",
    "the location of @xmath169 is also shown in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] by crosses connected by a solid line , in the same way as for @xmath170 .",
    "thus , planets are believed to form in distant orbits , after which they migrate inward one by one , maintaining their orbital separations wider than @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "these systems include kepler-18 , kepler-48 , kepler-52 , kepler-53 , and kepler-57 , which all have 2:1 commensurabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] gives the lower limits on the migration timescale .",
    "for example , the kepler-18 system consists of two low ",
    "density neptune  mass planets ( c and d ) near a 2:1 resonance and an inner super  earth ( b ) @xcite .",
    "the orbital separation of planets c and d is @xmath172 .",
    "the planets are believed to undergo migration with a differential migration speed slower than @xmath173 .",
    "next , we focus on super  earth  mass planets @xmath174 , which have a relatively large number of samples , and compare their histories with the migration theory .",
    "planets with a few tens of the earth mass or less might have experienced type i migration . through a linear calculation ,",
    "the type i migration timescale is given by @xcite @xmath175 where @xmath176 denotes the surface density gradient .",
    "for optically thin disks , the temperature distribution is @xcite @xmath177 which determines the sound velocity @xmath178 .",
    "we scale the gas surface density as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a scaling factor . if we introduce the type i migration efficiency @xmath181 to express the uncertainty in the type i migration theory , the type i migration timescale for @xmath182 and @xmath183 is written as @xmath184 the type i migration speed is still uncertain ) . ] . here",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the inner body is stationary and the outer body undergoes inward migration",
    ". then the type i migration timescale ( equation  [ [ eq : typei ] ] ) , which is identical to the relative migration timescale between the two bodies , can be drawn as a function of @xmath185 ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] ) .",
    "some of the exoplanets with masses of @xmath186 are in 2:1 resonances .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] , they would not have undergone rapid migration , so @xmath187 . on the other hand ,",
    "some planets are captured into closely spaced resonances . for them , a short migration time is required , and @xmath188 .    in order to reconcile the low migration efficiency ( @xmath187 ) and the linear type i migration theory ,",
    "the migration of inner planets should be considered .",
    "if the inner planets migrate when they are captured into mean motion resonances , the differential migration speeds become much slower than the migration rate estimated from equation  ( [ eq : type1lin ] ) .",
    "this can explain the planets in the 2:1 mean motion resonances .",
    "on the other hand , the migration of inner planets is negligible if the inner planets are much smaller than the outer ones and/or if the inner planets have orbits around the inner edge of the disk .",
    "such pairs of planets can be in closely spaced resonance because of the high relative migration speed .",
    "in addition , the other possibility for a pileup of planets with masses of @xmath189 is that they are formed near the current resonance locations ( e.g. , 3:2 and 2:1 ) .",
    "the orbital separations for 10earth  mass planets in 3:2 and 2:1 resonances are @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "this is comparable to the typical separation after the oligarchic growth phase : planets are formed _ in situ _ and then migrate slightly and are captured in the resonances .",
    "as argued above , the formation of resonances between two planets can be discussed in terms of two cases of the orbital separation at the time migration begins ; namely , the planets are well separated from each other @xmath192 , or they have relatively close orbits @xmath193 .",
    "the orbital separation of the planets at the onset of migration is characterized by their migration and growth timescales .",
    "the growth timescale of a planet @xmath194 is determined by the accretion rate of surrounding planetesimals in the classical planet growth model , which is similar to or longer than the type i migration timescale at the time of migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the inner planet starts to migrate before the outer planet does , resulting in an expansion of the orbital separation @xmath192 . on the other hand ,",
    "as planets grow , the surrounding planetesimals stirred by the planets are fragmented by mutual collisions .",
    "the resultant fragments effectively accrete onto planets @xcite ; @xmath194 depends on the initial planetesimal mass and radial gas density profile , and @xmath194 might be shorter than @xmath9 in some cases @xcite when migration begins .",
    "if @xmath195 , the two planets can start their migration almost simultaneously , in which case the orbital separation @xmath193 is maintained during migration .",
    "detailed calculations that include accretion , fragmentation , and migration are needed to clarify this behavior .",
    "below we discuss some individual systems .",
    "first , in this subsection the systems in closely spaced resonances ( e.g. , 4:3 and 5:4 ) are considered .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dis_m1_ta ] , the differences in @xmath1 between adjacent pairs are small ; for instance , the @xmath1 difference between the 4:3 and 5:4 resonances is only a factor of two .",
    "this means that the migration speeds for systems in closer resonances can be constrained well .",
    "the kepler-11 system , in which six planets have been confirmed , has a possible pair of planets in a 5:4 mean motion resonance ( planets b and c ) .",
    "the critical migration timescales for the 4:3 and 5:4 resonances are @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively . thus",
    ", if these planets are formed well separated from each other @xmath192 and then undergo convergent migration , the migration timescale would be a few thousand times @xmath27 .",
    "this migration speed is slightly higher than that of type i migration @xmath198 .",
    "because the other planets in the kepler-11 system are not considered in resonances , it may not be natural to suppose that the planets undergo significant migration .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that they are formed _ in situ _ and exhibit slight inward migration , which leads to capture into the 5:4 resonance .",
    "in addition , the required high type i migration speed is inconsistent with the typical migration speed which is predicted by the population synthesis model @xcite , which would also support the _ in situ _ formation .",
    "the orbital separation is slightly smaller than the typical orbital separation after oligarchic growth at 1  au @xmath199 ; however , it has been shown that planets can be formed with smaller orbital separations near the central star @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the planets formed _ in situ _ and planet b exhibited outward migration due to the tidal torque from the central star , resulting in capture into the resonance .",
    "note that the difficulty of _ in situ _ accretion was pointed out in an investigation of the accretion and evolution of a hydrogen  rich atmosphere for kepler-11 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the planets are formed in distant orbits and migrate inward as a resonant convoy , in which the planets can pass through 2:1 resonances as they are pushed inward by the outer bodies in the resonances @xcite .",
    "however , in such a case , it is likely that other planets are also in resonances in the final state .",
    "the kepler-60 system consists of three planets : the inner pair ( b and c ) has 5:4 commensurability , and the outer pair ( c and d ) seems to be in a 4:3 resonance . if we assume that these planets formed well separated and then migrated inward , the differential migration timescale would be approximately @xmath201 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : typei ] ) , we find that the efficiency of type i migration multiplied by the scaling factor for the gas surface density is @xmath202 .",
    "this means that if the gas surface density is similar to that of the minimum  mass solar nebula , the migration speed would be that predicted by the linear theory of type i migration @xcite .",
    "we also do not exclude the possibility of an _ in situ _ formation model for this system .",
    "next , we discuss resonant systems with small orbital separations @xmath203 , which can be hill unstable . in the hd  200964 system ,",
    "two jovian  mass planets lie in a 4:3 mean motion resonance ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and their orbital separation is @xmath204 . if we assume that these planets are stable despite their small separation , the differential migration timescale for passing through the 3:2 resonance would be extremely short @xmath205 .",
    "this migration speed is almost impossible to achieve because a large amount of angular momentum should be delivered to the disk .",
    "thus , it is not easy to provide a formation model that produces the orbital properties of the hd  200964 system .",
    "in fact , @xcite have also claimed that no formation scenarios are successful in reproducing 4:3 resonant planets similar to those in the hd  200964 system . because the pair of planets around hd  200964 have almost crossing orbits , they might be in temporary resonance following orbital instability .",
    "the hr  8799 system has inner and outer debris disks @xcite and four planets that were discovered by direct imaging @xcite .",
    "the masses have not been well constrained ; the planets have masses between a few and 13 jupiter masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the orbital separations of the second innermost pair ( planets d and c ) and the outermost pair ( planets c and b ) are small @xmath206 , it is plausible that the two pairs of planets are in 2:1 mean motion resonances , which can stabilize the system over the estimated age of the star @xcite . in this case",
    ", our model gives a lower limit on the migration timescale of @xmath207 .",
    "this value is quite small , so it may not provide a useful constraint .",
    "in addition to this lower limit , the time of passage of the hill unstable region should be shorter than the orbital unstable time for a system with small orbital separation @xmath208 . according to @xcite , the crossing time , which is the timescale of the initiation of orbital instability , is @xmath209 ; therefore , the actual migration timescale would be between @xmath210 and @xmath196 . the type ii migration expected for such massive planets can not bring about the short migration timescale .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if the masses of the planets are small , the system can be hill stable .",
    "gliese  876 , an m  dwarf star with a mass of @xmath211 , harbors four planets : planets c and b have comparable masses , and planets d and e are relatively small , with masses of @xmath186 .",
    "planets c  b and b  e are in or close to the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the orbital separations for the inner pair ( c  b ) and the outer pair ( b  e ) are @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively .",
    "these planets are believed to be in the 2:1 resonance to stabilize their orbits at such a small orbital separation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower limits to the differential migration timescales are @xmath207 for the inner pair and @xmath214 for the outer pair , which is consistent with the migration timescale obtained from a hydrodynamical simulation of this system by @xcite .    finally in this subsection , we add some comments on planets with small separations that are still hill stable .",
    "the hd  45364 system consists of two planets with masses comparable to those of saturn and jupiter @xcite , which seem to be in a 3:2 mean motion resonance with a separation of @xmath215 .",
    "this system should have undergone rapid migration to pass through the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance is given by @xmath216 ; thus , the differential migration timescale should be at least shorter than @xmath217 .",
    "@xcite also examined this system both numerically and analytically , and proposed that a relative migration timescale shorter than @xmath218 is needed to pass through the 2:1 resonance , which is consistent with our results .",
    "our model also provides a lower limit of @xmath219 on the migration timescale .",
    "the planets in this system would have undergone type iii migration .",
    "here we apply our results to resonant systems in the solar system .",
    "one good example is the galilean satellites around jupiter , where io  europa and europa  ganymede are in the 2:1 mean motion resonance . replacing the stellar mass @xmath220 with the jupiter mass",
    ", our model gives a lower limit of @xmath221 on the differential migration speed .",
    "this constraint is consistent with the result of _",
    "n_body work on the formation of the galilean satellites ( equation  [ 32 ] in @xcite ) .",

    "simulations by @xcite showed that the tendency could be explained by the migration speed of neptune .",
    "we apply our formula for the inward migration of the outer objects to resonant capture by an outwardly migrating neptune .",
    "the obtained migration timescale of @xmath222@xmath223myr is plausible for the high population of the 3:2 resonance , which is roughly consistent with @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this estimated migration timescale is also consistent with that obtained by @xcite of @xmath34@xmath223myr , which is derived from studying the proportion of tnos in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 resonance .",

    "the application of our model to these objects should be done carefully .",
    "we can further discuss other planet formation models , which assume the establishment of mean motion resonances . in the grand tack model @xcite , saturn migrates faster than jupiter , which results in capture into a 3:2 mean motion resonance with jupiter . for capture into the 3:2 resonance ,",

    "considered high  speed type iii migration , which is necessary to realize the grand tack scenario .",
    "we investigated capture into first  order mean motion resonances in a system of two bodies undergoing damping of the eccentricity and semimajor axis using _ n_body integrations . in some of our calculations",
    ", we considered the case in which the mass of one body is negligible . in addition",
    ", we also studied systems with equal masses .",
    "in fact , orbital calculations were performed with a wide range of parameters ; we found that the critical migration timescale can be described using the mass ratio between the larger body and the central object , and depends weakly on the @xmath19damping timescale and initial eccentricity .",
    "the empirical formula is given by equation  ( [ eq : ta_crit ] ) , where the critical migration timescale for equal  mass bodies is about an order of magnitude shorter than that for systems with a massless particle .",
    "we also confirmed the power ",
    "law dependence of the mass with index @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence is also supported by analytical arguments that compare the resonant libration timescale and the migration timescale .",
    "additional simulations of closely spaced resonances were run , and empirical fits to the results were derived .",
    "all the fitting formulae from our calculations are shown in figure  [ fig : dis2_m1_ta ] and table  [ tbl : fitting ] .",
    "the empirical formula we derived can constrain the relative migration speed in systems of two bodies undergoing convergent migration toward capture into mean motion resonances .",
    "this means that our model can be useful for understanding the origins of exoplanet systems in resonances . for systems in",
    "closely spaced mean motion resonances ( e.g. , kepler-11 , kepler-60 ) , the migration timescale can be well constrained .",
    "it is also possible that the planets formed _ in situ_. the systems in which the orbital separation is smaller than @xmath226 ( e.g. , hr  8799 , gliese  876 ) are believed to become stable owing to resonant effects .",
    "lower limits to the relative migration timescale were placed on several systems in 2:1 resonances .",
    "the origin of the hd  200964 system , which is in 4:3 resonance , remains unclear .",
    "our model also provides constraints on the migration timescale of systems other than exoplanets ( e.g. , the grand tack model of the solar system ) .",
    "furthermore , when the number of discovered exoplanets in resonances increases sufficiently in the future , the typical type i and ii migration timescales can be obtained using our results ; future observations will allow us to tackle this issue .",

    "<S> we investigate the condition for capture into first  order mean motion resonances using numerical simulations with a wide range of various parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on deriving the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance ; additional numerical experiments for closely spaced resonances ( e.g. , 3:2 ) are also performed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical migration timescale is determined by the planet  to  stellar mass ratio , and its dependence exhibits power  law behavior with index @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is also supported by simple analytic arguments . </S>",

    "<S> order commensurabilities is constrained . assuming that pairs of planets originally form well separated from each other and then undergo convergent migration and are captured in resonances , it is possible that a number of exoplanets experienced rapid orbital migration . for systems in closely spaced resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the differential migration timescale between the resonant pair can be constrained well ; it is further suggested that several exoplanets underwent migration that can equal or even exceed the type i migration rate predicted by the linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that some of them may have formed _ in situ_. future observations and the use of our model will allow us to statistically determine the typical migration speed in a protoplanetary disk . </S>"
