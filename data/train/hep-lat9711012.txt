    "it has long been a problem that the @xmath3 @xmath4 amplitude calculated in quenched lattice qcd is about a factor two too large compared to the experimental value@xcite . in this article",
    "we report a new study of this problem , incorporating various theoretical and technical advances in recent years for analysis .",
    "in particular we discuss in detail how one - loop corrections of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) recently calculated@xcite affect physical predictions for the decay amplitude from lattice qcd simulations .",
    "our simulation is carried out in quenched lattice qcd employing the standard plaquette action for gluons at @xmath1 and the wilson action for quarks .",
    "two lattice sizes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are employed .",
    "we take up , down and strange quarks to be degenerate , and make measurements at four values of the common hopping parameter , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which correspond to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the 4-quark operator most relevant for the @xmath3 @xmath2 decay is @xmath15   / 2 $ ] .",
    "we extract the decay amplitude from the 4-point correlation function defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are wall sources for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in our calculations on a lattice of a temporal size @xmath21 , the walls are placed at the time slices @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the mesons are all created at rest , and the 4-quark operator @xmath25 is projected to zero spatial momentum .",
    "we can use two types of factors to remove the normalization factors in @xmath26 .",
    "if we define @xmath27 we find @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass shift of the 2-pion state due to finite lattice size effects  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ rwfrpf ] we plot @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 as a function of time @xmath38 of the weak operator .",
    "we clearly observe a non - vanishing slope for @xmath39 , while @xmath40 exhibits a plateau as expected .",
    "the decay amplitude can be obtained by fitting @xmath39 to a single exponential or @xmath40 to a constant .",
    "we find the results to be mutually consistent within the statistical error .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    the one - loop renormalization factor relating the operator @xmath25 on the lattice and that in the continuum was obtained in refs .",
    "we set @xmath41 or @xmath42 as the matching point and employ tadpole - improved perturbation theory with the mean - field improved @xmath43 coupling constant@xcite .",
    "quark fields are normalized with the klm factor  @xcite , @xmath44 .",
    "in earlier calculations tree - level chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) formula was used to obtain the physical amplitude @xmath45 from the lattice counterpart @xmath46 .",
    "the formula takes the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are physical masses , and @xmath50 is the degenerate mass of @xmath51 and @xmath52 mesons on the lattice . clearly the physical amplitude should be independent of the lattice mass @xmath50 if the matching formula is exact .    in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] we compare results for the physical decay amplitude from a previous work@xcite carried out at @xmath53 on a @xmath54 spatial lattice with those of our simulation at @xmath1 .",
    "our values obtained with the conventional quark normalization @xmath55 ( crosses and open squares ) are consistent with their results , but are larger than the experimental result roughly by a factor two .",
    "let us also note with our results ( circles and squares ) that ( i ) the klm normalization and tadpole improvement of the operator have a significant effect on the amplitude , ( ii ) there is a clear dependence of the amplitude on the lattice meson mass @xmath50 , and ( iii ) a significant finite - size effect is observed between the two lattice sizes .",
    "these features show that the tree - level chpt is inadequate to extract the physical amplitude from lattice results .    in fig .",
    "[ frho ] we show how predictions for the physical amplitude change if we apply the one - loop formula of chpt  @xcite to our results . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the cutoffs of chpt for quenched and full theory . in converting to physical values",
    "we ignore effects of @xmath58 contact terms of the chpt lagrangian since their values are not well known .",
    "an interesting point is that a size dependence seen with the tree - level analysis in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] is absent .",
    "another important point is that the magnitude of the amplitude decreases by @xmath59% over the range of meson mass covered in our simulation .",
    "the amplitude depends significantly on the quenched lattice cutoff @xmath56 , in particular toward larger values of @xmath50 .",
    "= 7.0 cm    our results in fig .",
    "[ frho ] show that a sizable meson mass dependence still remains .",
    "this may be attributed to @xmath58 contact terms which were not taken into account .",
    "if we assume that the contact terms of the full theory are as small as suggested by the phenomenological analysis  @xcite , we can estimate the physical amplitude by a linear extrapolation of @xmath60 to the chiral limit . in table",
    "[ finalfit ] we list results for several choices of the cutoff and the operator matching point @xmath61 . as is expected from fig .  [ frho ] , variation of results on the choice of the cutoff parameters is small , being of the order of 10% .",
    "allowing for this uncertainty , the values in table  [ finalfit ] are consistent with the experimental value of @xmath62 .",
    "the present study has shown that the quenched result for the @xmath0 decay amplitude agrees with experiment much better than previously thought , especially if the chiral limit is taken for the lattice meson mass . away from the chiral limit ,",
    "the amplitude depends significantly on the cutoff scales of chpt , however .",
    "this problem is largely ascribed to a mismatch of chiral logarithms between the quenched and full theories@xcite . in order to obtain @xmath0 decay amplitude free from this uncertainty ,",
    "we need simulations in full qcd .",
