    "@xmath13 is a parameter that indicates how well the referee can prepare the desired qubit states @xmath14 , with @xmath15 for perfect preparation ( see methods section ) .",
    "alice and bob win the game if and only if the payoff function is positive , i.e. , if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "charlie makes no assumptions as to how alice and bob generate the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 on each run , as they and their devices are untrusted .",
    "alice and bob are told the rules of the game , and are allowed to plan a joint strategy beforehand , but can not communicate during the game ( this may be enforced by having them generate their values in spacelike separated regions , so that communication would require sending signals faster than the speed of light ) .",
    "remarkably , despite the absence of trust by charlie , alice and bob can not cheat  they are only able to win the game if they genuinely share quantum steering entanglement ( see methods section ) .",
    "for example , suppose that alice and bob share a two - qubit werner state , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the singlet state @xcite , and adopt the following strategy : on receipt of signal @xmath3 alice measures @xmath22 , while bob measures the projection operator @xmath23 onto the singlet state in the two - qubit hilbert space spanned by his system and @xmath14 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that the corresponding theoretical value of the payoff function in eq .",

    "this condition is in fact necessary for them to be able to win the game with a shared werner state ( see methods section ) , and hence the above strategy is optimal .",
    "we experimentally verified device - independent epr - steering using our quantum - refereed game .",
    "alice and bob s shared state , and the states sent by charlie to bob , were encoded in photon polarization qubit states . the payoff function @xmath26 was calculated via single qubit measurements and a partial bell state measurement , all using linear optics and photon counting .    in the experiment ( fig .",
    "2 ) , charlie s photon source generated photon pairs that were unentangled in polarisation , and degenerate at 820 nm .",
    "one photon encoded the polarisation state @xmath27 and was transmitted to bob , while the other photon acted as a heralding signal .",
    "the other photon source generated polarization entangled photon pairs at 820 nm that were shared between alice and bob .",
    "alice was represented by a single qubit measurement station , used to measure one half of the entangled state .",
    "bob was represented by a partial bell - state measurement ( bsm ) device @xcite , which performed a joint measurement on bob s half of the entangled state and @xmath27 .",

    ", the workings of alice s and bob s devices need not be known , as would indeed be the case in a field demonstration .",
    "a key innovation of our protocol is that the payoff function @xmath26 ( eq .  ( [ payoff ] ) ) can not present ` false positives ' of steering verification .",
    "that is , alice and bob do not have to be trusted , and can try to cheat by any means , provided that they can not communicate during the demonstration ( this latter requirement is also necessarily mandatory in any bell test) only a steerable state can ever yield a positive payoff value .",
    "it is also required that , in calculating the payoff function , charlie chooses @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 perfect ) characterises the quality of charlie s preparation in the states he sends to bob ( see methods ) ; in this work we choose @xmath32 .",

    "the bound @xmath52 for our steering test requires @xmath53 ( see methods section ) , while the best explicit bell - type inequality for werner states is violated for @xmath54the vrtesi bound @xcite  slightly below the well - known chsh bound of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "( note that it remains an open question whether there exists a bell inequality that can be violated for @xmath56 , and it is known to be impossible for @xmath57 @xcite ) .",

    "this violation may be compared with the theoretical prediction @xmath61 from eq .",

    "epr - steering is a key quantum resource because , apart from its fundamental interest , it is known to be useful in secure quantum key distribution protocols @xcite .",
    "compared with violation of a loophole - free bell inequality  which provides fully device - independent qkd ",
    "epr - steering in its usual form provides a one - sided device - independent protocol , requiring trust in one party ( bob , say ) and their apparatus .",
    "our demonstration of quantum - refereed steering removes the need to trust bob and his apparatus , only requiring the assumption that quantum mechanics is a reliable description of reality .",
    "this lack of trust is possible essentially because bob is unable to unambiguously distinguish between the states sent to him by charlie @xcite .",
    "thus , as long as quantum mechanics is correct , the protocol has the advantages of bell inequality violation , but can tolerate higher noise ( i.e.  it works with entangled states with a higher degree of mixture ) .",
    "it should also be noted that steering inequalities exist for arbitrarily high degrees of noise and loss @xcite , and hence corresponding quantum - refereed steering games can be constructed using our methods for long - distance applications such as secure quantum networks @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath73 parameter that we have introduced is only required to characterise the degree of confidence in the preparation of the referee states .",
    "it is unnecessary to characterize the state that bob eventually receives from charlie ; indeed , transmission through any quantum channel will not change the protocol nor increase @xmath73 ( see methods section ) .",
    "therefore , as long as charlie can characterise his prepared states , the protocol can proceed .",
    "our protocol imposes a more complex measurement procedure on bob , a joint bell state measurement , compared to one - qubit pauli projections required in a bell test .",
    "as the protocol is robust against preparation and transmission imperfections of the referee states , this added complexity of bob s measurement is a reasonable overhead for removing all need for trust .",
    "we note that it is easier for alice and bob to demonstrate epr steering to charlie if he can prepare his states with a high degree of confidence , i.e. , with @xmath74 .",
    "a future challenge is to demonstrate the closure of the detection loophole and spacelike - separation loophole for our protocol .",

    "<S> has addressed a similar question @xcite , although steering , bell inequality violations , and calibration of the referee states ( see below ) were not considered .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give the first explicit construction of a quantum - refereed steering game , for the trust - free verification of steering entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate a proof - of - principle implementation , for optical polarisation qubits , in a scenario where no bell nonlocality as tested by the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite  is present . </S>",
    "<S> the results open the way to unconditionally secure key distribution protocols that do not require bell nonlocality , and which can circumvent the detection loophole . </S>"
