    "the detailed comparison of quasar absorption spectra with the predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations has established that the ly@xmath8 absorption ` forest ' is caused by a smoothly - fluctuating neutral component of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "the simulations also reveal a strong correlation between absorber hi column density and gas overdensity @xmath9 , so that the study of @xmath10 absorbers gives information about the igm for @xmath11 at @xmath5 ( e.g. zhang et al . 1998 ; dav et al .",
    "furthermore , studies of civ , siiv and ovi have revealed that the low - density igm is not  as was long expected  chemically pristine , but has been enriched to @xmath12 ( with a scatter of @xmath13dex ) down to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) ( e.g. , meyer & york 1987 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) , and perhaps to even lower overdensities ( e.g. , cowie & songaila 1998 ; ellison et al . 2000 ; schaye et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "this enrichment may have occurred during a population iii star - formation epoch at @xmath16 ( e.g. carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; abel et al .",

    "earlier enrichment might allow more uniform igm pollution ( depending on how strongly biased the star formation is ) , but is constrained by the amount of metal that can be generated at early times ; conversely , sufficient metal is easily available at late times , but the larger inter - galaxy spacing may preclude a homogeneous metal distribution ( which observations may or may not indicate ) .    in this paper , we address enrichment of the igm by supernova - driven winds from galaxies of ( gas+star ) masses @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "our calculations employ a smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation with @xmath21 dark matter particles and @xmath21 sph particles in a @xmath22 box , adopting a cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the simulation is described in more detail in aguirre et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and in weinberg et al .",
    "these simulations do _ not _ include winds , but we use a parameterized prescription , described in   [ sec - method ] , to add metals in a way that models their ejection and distribution by supernova - driven galactic outflows .",
    "this post - processing method allows us to easily vary our assumptions and parameters , and we give results for a number of representative models .",
    "we then compare the resulting intergalactic metal distribution to the quasar absorption line observations and discuss the implications for wind enrichment of the igm .",
    "the method by which we calculate igm enrichment is discussed in detail in aguirre et al .",
    "briefly , our method employs a limited number of outputs from already - completed sph simulations that include star formation .",
    "each unit of forming stellar mass instantaneously generates @xmath26 units of metal mass ( @xmath27 is assumed for all models ) .",
    "we then deposit this metal mass in nearby gas particles as follows :    1 .",
    "particles are grouped into bound objects ( ` galaxies ' ) .",
    "the mass of star formation is tallied for a given galaxy , for which we also compute the mass , star - formation rate ( sfr ) , and an area @xmath28 based on an empirical relation between disk area and mass ( gavazzi , peirini & boselli 1996 ) .",
    "galaxies with sfr / a @xmath29 sfr@xmath30 are assumed to coherently drive steady - state , mass - conserving winds with velocity @xmath31 at the center of star formation and with a mass outflow rate of @xmath32 times the sfr .",
    "here @xmath33 parameterizes the fraction of supernova kinetic energy in the wind , if we assume @xmath34ergs are released per 100@xmath35 of star formation .",
    "based on observations that generally @xmath36 ( heckman et al . 2000 ) , we use @xmath37 .",
    "we allow galaxies with sfr / a @xmath38 sfr@xmath39 to drive winds also , but with the wind energy attenuated by @xmath40 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "we divide the volume about the center of star formation into @xmath41 regions of equal solid angle about directions @xmath42 , with @xmath43 galactic gas particles per region ( thus @xmath41 increases with galaxy mass ) .",
    "4 .   for each angle",
    "@xmath42 we integrate the equations of motion of a ` test shell ' beginning at radius @xmath44 containing 10% of the galaxy s mass .",
    "the shell at radius @xmath45 feels accelerations due to gravity , the ram pressure of the wind ( attenuated by the potential difference between @xmath45 and @xmath44 ) , the ambient thermal pressure , and the sweeping up of a fraction @xmath46 of the ambient medium ( matter could be left behind by the shell either if the ambient medium is inhomogeneous , or as the shell fragments and leaves part of itself with lower velocity .",
    "we take a fiducial value of @xmath47 ) .",
    "all accelerations are computed using the simulation particles contained in the solid angle about @xmath42 ( see aguirre et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "eventually , the shell stalls ( i.e. has a negligible velocity with respect to the local medium ) at a radius @xmath48 .",
    "we also stop the shell if / when its propagation time exceeds the time between its launch and the redshift at which we quote our results .",
    "5 .   in each angular region ,",
    "metals are distributed among gas particles within @xmath48 such that the metal mass in a shell at @xmath45 of thickness @xmath49 is @xmath50 we generally take @xmath51 , but the resulting enrichment is rather insensitive to @xmath8 for @xmath52 ( aguirre et al .",
    "2001 ) . 6 .   if @xmath53 for some angle , the corresponding metal mass is not distributed as per the wind prescription , but is deposited ` locally ' over the 32 gas particles nearest to its progenitor star , using the sph smoothing kernel ( see , e.g. , hernquist & katz 1989 ) .    the process is repeated for each galaxy , at each time step .",
    "new stars are formed with the metallicity of the gas from which they form .",
    "metals accumulate in gas particles ( which move between time steps ) , and the distribution of metals in stars and in galactic and intergalactic gas can be assessed at each time step .",
    "we first give results for six illustrative models .",
    "the first four have all their parameters fixed ( to the ` fiducial ' values given above ) except for the wind outflow velocity @xmath31 , which we take to be @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 ( uniformly distributed in the given range for each model ) , independent of galaxy mass ( as suggested by heckman et al .",
    "next , we fix @xmath58 and vary the entrainment fraction @xmath46 from 1% to 100% .    the key results of the calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - windres ] .",
    "the top two panels give a sparse sampling of individual particle metallicities , versus the gas overdensity @xmath59 .",
    "the stellar yield @xmath26 is uncertain by perhaps a factor of two , and all of the curves could be scaled vertically for a higher assumed value .",
    "the metallicity at @xmath60 could also be ( roughly ) scaled down by a factor @xmath61 if a fraction @xmath62 of the metal produced is assumed not to be incorporated into the wind .",
    "panel  a shows that in the @xmath63 model , the enrichment is fairly uniform .",
    "a significant fraction of particles ( shown in a bar at the bottom with an artificial 1 dex of scatter added ) have zero metallicity , but the rest have a metallicity spread at a given overdensity of @xmath641 - 2 dex .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath65 model ( panel b ) has _ some _ metal rich particles at low densities , but many more pristine regions that the winds have not reached .",
    "panels c and d show the median and mean gas metallicities vs. overdensity for all six models .",
    "the shaded box indicates the rough range of metallicity found in most absorption systems for which metal lines are detected .",
    "the area with vertical lines indicates the region where the metallicity is agreed upon by independent groups ( e.g. , rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetzet 1997 ; dav et al .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate yet smaller overdensities to which this metallicity may extend ( e.g. , ellison et al . 2000 ; schaye et al .",
    "2000 ) . even if the observational results were complete , neither the mean nor the median particle metallicities we quote are directly comparable to the observational results , but should bracket the quantity that is comparable",
    ". the mean would be too high because ( especially in cases with inhomogeneous distributions ) it tends to be dominated by a small number of high - metallicity regions ; the median gives information about the _ number _ of lines that would be metal rich , but is an underestimate because an absorption line would generally probe more than one simulation gas particle , decreasing the scatter .",
    "in panel e the gas metallicity is multiplied by the fraction of gas at the given overdensity , showing what fraction of all cosmic metal lies at a given density . for the models that can plausibly account for the observed metal lines in the igm ,",
    "@xmath66 of all metal is extragalactic ( eg ) , i.e. is not in cooled gas or stars in galaxies    the curves show that the assumed wind velocity at inception is quite important in the resulting igm enrichment .",
    "slow winds tend to be confined , as can be seen from the small fraction ( @xmath67 ) of all metals outside of galaxies in the @xmath68 model ( see panel e ) .",
    "those that escape tend to stall at relatively small distances where the density is still high , and fail to effectively pollute the low - density igm .",
    "increasing @xmath31 both increases the total eg metal density ( raising the eg fraction to 50% for @xmath69 ) and shifts the metals to lower density regions ( increasing the @xmath70 mean enrichment by a factor of several hundred ) .",
    "changes in the entrainment fraction also have a fairly large effect .",
    "if ( instead of the fiducial 10% ) only 1% of the ambient gas were entrained , 20% of all metals would be outside of galaxies in our fiducial 300km / s model ; while only 4% would be extragalactic if all ambient gas were entrained .",
    "changing our other model parameters within a range of reasonable values has a smaller but still substantial effect ; doubling sfr@xmath39 or changing @xmath33 by a factor of two changes the ejection fraction by @xmath71 and changes the mean enrichment at @xmath70 by @xmath72 ( lowering sfr@xmath39 would have little effect since most galaxies at @xmath73 are already driving winds for our assumed value . )",
    "two methodological points concerning our results merit discussion .",
    "first , resolution tests reveal that galaxies with @xmath74 in baryons are well - resolved .",
    "galaxies below this limit exist ( and are used in the analysis ) but will be under - represented both in their number and in their star - formation rates ( weinberg et al .",
    "studies of dwarf galaxies at high @xmath75 have concluded that at @xmath76 , galaxies of baryon mass @xmath77 are suppressed by photo - evaporation ( e.g. , ferrara & tolstoy 1999 ) , leaving a ( redshift - dependent ) ` gap ' in mass where galaxies may exist but are not resolved by our simulations .",
    "second , our method necessarily neglects the effect of the outflows on the galaxies .",
    "galaxy formation studies with ineffective feedback generally predict more low - mass galaxies than are observed , and the simulations used here may over - estimate the cosmic sfr and stellar mass for this reason ( see weinberg et al .",
    "1999 and aguirre et al .",
    "while we can not quantify exactly the effect these two ( opposing ) inaccuracies will have on our results , comparison of the mass functions for different numerical resolutions indicates that we can probably hope to estimate the enrichment by @xmath76 galaxies to within a factor of a few .",
    "because igm enrichment is so sensitive to @xmath31 , we can set a lower limit on that quantity if the observed enrichment is primarily due to winds of the type discussed in this paper .",
    "to achieve the _",
    "mean _ metallicity of @xmath78 observed in @xmath79 absorbers , @xmath80 is necessary , and @xmath81 would be needed to enrich absorbers down to @xmath82 with a similar metallicity ( though this may _",
    "over_-enrich higher column density systems ) .",
    "a higher velocity is probably necessary if the observed enrichment is fairly uniform ; for a _",
    "median _ metallicity of @xmath83 down to @xmath84 , a wind speed of @xmath81 is probably required , though a more detailed analysis is necessary for a robust comparison .",
    "these conclusions depend on the assumed entrainment fraction ( and more weakly on the other parameters ) , but changing these assumptions can not increase the enrichment very much because enrichment is always limited by the available time between shell launch and @xmath85 thus if the observed enrichment turns out to be uniform at column densities @xmath86 , enrichment from smaller and/or higher redshift galaxies would be required .",
    "in addition to providing estimates of intergalactic enrichment , our calculations also shed light on the physics of wind escape .",
    "figure  [ fig - wqz3 ] gives information about the outflows propagating between @xmath87 and @xmath88 from individual galaxies in the @xmath89 model .",
    "panel a shows the shell stalling radius for each shell about a sample of 500 simulation galaxies ; each point corresponds to one propagation direction and each vertical ` stripe ' to a galaxy . at @xmath90 about half of all galaxies are driving winds that reach @xmath91kpc . the variation in @xmath92 for a given galaxy is due to anisotropies in the galaxy and igm ; variations in @xmath92 among galaxies of a given mass are due to combined variations in the outflow velocity , the sfr and the properties of the nearby igm . since we have assumed that wind velocity is independent of galaxy mass , the most massive galaxies drive winds ineffectively because of their relatively large potential wells .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath93kpc is due to the finite time between @xmath94 and @xmath88 ( where we stop each shell s integration ) .",
    "this is shown in panel b , which displays the stalling time for the shell segments ( one point for each angle ) .",
    "as shown in panel c , at @xmath95 almost all of the galaxies exceed the assumed critical sfr/(area ) .",
    "but as long as this threshold is satisfied , the areal sfr does not strongly influence how well winds escape .",
    "panel d allows a comparison of our results for wind escape with two other investigations .",
    "the points in the figure indicate the supernova energy injection rate for each galaxy in units of @xmath96ergs , converted from star formation rates by assuming that one supernova releasing @xmath97ergs forms per per @xmath98 of star formation .",
    "the vertically shaded region indicates the range of sfrs measured in bright , wind - driving lyman - break galaxies by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , converted in the same way .",
    "the solid line is a fit that extrapolates the simulation results to lower - mass galaxies , and the dotted line represents our fiducial critical sfr / area ( i.e. we assume that galaxies above the dotted line are driving winds coherently  though the winds may ultimately be retained as shown in panel a ) .",
    "mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ; see also ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) have studied galactic winds in dwarf galaxies using numerical simulations , for the range of galaxy masses and supernova energy injection rates shown by the shaded box .",
    "they find that only the lowest - mass galaxies ( @xmath99 ) can ` blow - away ' the bulk of their ism , though higher mass galaxies can allow ` blowout ' where hot , metal rich gas can escape .",
    "their results agree roughly with the estimates of silich & tenorio - tagle ( 2001 ) , who find that winds can only escape spherical galaxies ( corresponding to ` blowout ' ) for energy injection rates above the dashed line of panel d ; winds can escape flattened galaxies for rates above the dot - dashed line . according to our calculations , winds can escape the simulation galaxies ( which are not highly flattened ) , even for entrainment fraction unity , from galaxies with mass @xmath100 .",
    "this would seem to conflict with the findings of mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) , but the disagreement is probably due to the rather small energy injection rates they assume for their largest galaxies  @xmath101    times smaller than the rate indicated by the cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulated galaxy sfrs at high @xmath75 are high enough to fulfill the ( extrapolated ) ` blow - away ' criterion of silich & tenorio - tagle for all galaxy masses , as are the sfrs of the lyman - break galaxies ( unless the galaxies have masses @xmath102 . )    in figure  [ fig - forces ] we show plots of both igm enrichment and stalling radius vs. mass in the fiducial model with each effect on shell propagation turned off in turn .",
    "first ( panel d ) we remove the time constraint .",
    "this shows that some shell fragments from @xmath95 galaxies would ultimately    propagate to @xmath103mpc ( the cutoff comes from the distance @xmath104 at which @xmath105 ) .",
    "panel e shows the results if the wind is turned off @xmath106years after the shell launch .",
    "this is roughly the minimal interval @xmath107 over which a starburst ` event ' could drive the shell , since the energy deposition rate is roughly constant for @xmath108yr after a coeval starburst ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the wind ( or thermal pressure ) will still drive the shell for the time @xmath109 it takes the wind ( or sound ) to cross the shell radius . if the shell speed is comparable to the wind speed , @xmath110 so @xmath111 .",
    "the effect of truncating the wind is noticeable but slight . in panel",
    "f we have turned off gravity , and essentially all of the shells escape , showing that in this case gravity is the dominant effect in confining winds . of the shells that still do not escape ,",
    "about half are retained due to thermal pressure , and about half due to the sweeping up of matter .",
    "panel g shows the effect of very low mass entrainment : winds escape to slightly larger radii on average , but can actually increase the escape radius in some cases because higher entrainment adds more momentum to the shell .",
    "entrainment actually causes as much deceleration on the shell as gravity ; but since gravity also attenuates the wind ( decreasing the acceleration of the shell ) , it has a larger overall effect .",
    "panel h shows that taking into account infall from the igm is not very important , but tends to slightly decrease the stalling radius . in summary , we find that only the hot wind , the entrainment of ambient material and gravity are important in determining shell propagation in most cases at @xmath88 . more hot gas ( especially in clusters ) and stronger infall ,",
    "however , might make thermal pressure and ig infall more important at low @xmath75 .",
    "the most important factor limiting the enrichment of very low density regions is the time constraint as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - times ] .",
    "if we assume that the winds can propagate ` instantaneously ' into the igm , they reach quite low - density regions , and the enrichment at @xmath88 is only slightly higher and more uniform than at @xmath95 .",
    "but if the time limit is respected , the enrichment spreads to significantly lower - density regions between @xmath95 and @xmath88 due to the extra gyr of propagation time .",
    "metal enrichment of the @xmath112 igm has also been investigated by gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , gnedin ( 1998 ) and cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) using simulations that include chemical evolution .",
    "gnedin finds that supernova blow - apart of protogalaxies is ineffective , but that dynamical removal of metals can explain the metals in low - density regions  though this requires a metal formation rate at @xmath113 that is about 10 - 50 times that observationally inferred at @xmath114 ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1999 ) and implies more efficient dynamical removal of metals than found by aguirre et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) assume a fixed metal ejection fraction into regions of @xmath115 ( the resolution of their grid - based hydrodynamical treatment ; see cen & ostriker 2000 ) .",
    "their results for mean metallicity are similar to our @xmath116 model , though their metallicity distribution at fixed @xmath59 shows almost no scatter at @xmath88 ( but becomes more inhomogeneous with time ) .",
    "in contrast , our calculations find a highly inhomogeneous metallicity distribution , which becomes somewhat more uniform with time .",
    "this may be due to the rather low spatial resolution of their simulations or may indicate that stars are forming ( and expelling metals into the igm ) in very low density regions in cen & ostriker s simulations , in contrast to ours .",
    "comparison of quasar absorption spectra to simulated spectra shows that @xmath117 dex of scatter in gas metallicity ( among absorbers in which metals are detected ) may be necessary to explain the variation in observed civ / hi ratios ( rauch et al . 1997 ; hellsten et al .",
    "1997 ; dav et al .",
    "1998 ) , so this point merits further investigation , but will probably require the generation of synthetic spectra from our simulations .",
    "an important physical effect that is not addressed by our treatment is that of the outflowing winds on the igm : if metals are transported directly from galaxies to very low density regions by movement of large quantities of gas , then this kinetic energy must be absorbed by the igm . yet",
    "the widths of low - column density ly@xmath8 forest lines are typically @xmath118 , and line ratios indicate photoionization , not collisional ionization ( e.g. songaila & cowie 1996 )",
    ". our method does not allow us to assess the effects of winds on the igm ( see theuns , mo & schaye [ 2000 ] for some discussion ) , but we can make some general comments . if expanding shells of swept - up gas maintained their integrity and propagated to roughly the inter - galaxy spacing , they would completely re - make the structure of the ly@xmath8 forest , except perhaps in deep voids . but this is not the expected scenario : upon leaving a galaxy , the wind and ` shell ' will likely mix into a complex , multi - phase outflow consisting of fragmented shell(s ) , the hot wind , dense clouds of entrained ( but not swept - up ) ambient medium , etc .",
    "small , dense blobs might maintain fairly low temperature through efficient cooling , and could reach large radii before stalling and mixing with the igm ( and by definition when the wind stalls it has small local velocity and will not greatly heat the medium ) .",
    "in addition , the hot wind itself will not be observable in absorption , and will flow more more easily in low - density directions .",
    "hence it may not seriously disrupt the relatively dense filaments that give rise to much of the ly@xmath8 absorption .",
    "these issues merit further study because our results , combined with observations of high-@xmath75 galaxies , indicate that significant outflow from @xmath5 galaxies seems inevitable .",
    "essentially all of the simulated galaxies at @xmath5    display specific time - averaged sfrs exceeding the observed threshold for driving superwinds in local ( starburst ) galaxies  and stochastic star formation should result in much higher rates for short periods .",
    "moreover , available observations of @xmath0 galaxies reveal that they _ are _ driving winds , with characteristic velocities exceeding those of our fiducial model : pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that lyman break galaxies at @xmath119 with sfrs of @xmath120/yr drive winds at @xmath121 ( as measured by absorption lines ) or @xmath122 ( in ly@xmath8 emission ) .",
    "these galaxies correspond to the highest ( @xmath123 ) mass simulated galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - wqz3 ] and dav et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the outflow signatures in the spectra are quite similar to those in the nearby wind - driving starbursts upon which we base our method , so the observed velocities should roughly correspond to our assumed initial outflow velocities . in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lybr ] , the outflows tend to escape the galaxies even for an entrainment fraction unity , and propagate to large distances ",
    "none of the forces we include in our calculations would be capable of containing the outflow .",
    "thus we predict that winds from lyman - break galaxies do escape those galaxies potentials and enrich the igm , population . ] and expect that this would hold for lower mass galaxies as well .",
    "we have simulated the enrichment of the @xmath88 igm by galactic winds from @xmath124 galaxies , assuming that most drive winds with properties similar to those observed in local starbursts and in lyman - break galaxies .",
    "we find that for winds with outflow velocity @xmath125 enrichment is significant , and that if @xmath126 , the winds can ( roughly ) account for the metallicity of the low - column density ( @xmath127 ) ly@xmath8 forest .",
    "higher velocities could enrich yet lower - density components of the igm .",
    "our treatment of wind - driven outflows includes forces due to gravity , thermal pressure , ram pressure of the ambient medium , and the hot wind itself .",
    "we find that at @xmath112 thermal pressure and the the infall velocity of the igm are generally negligible , but that outflows can be confined by gravity or ambient material for sufficiently high mass galaxies and/or low velocity winds .",
    "our results suggest that the winds observed in lyman break galaxies should escape and travel to fairly large distances .",
    "if the lyman break galaxies represent high - mass , non - starburst galaxies , then the lower - mass @xmath88 galaxies should drive outflows to large distances as well , unless outflow velocity depends strongly on galaxy mass .",
    "the effect of such winds on the physical and thermal structure of the igm is essentially unknown .",
    "the good agreement between simulations like these and the observed statistical properties of the ly@xmath8 forest suggest that the effect can not be extremely large .",
    "we find that the main effect preventing the enrichment of very low - density regions of the igm is the time available for metal - rich material to propagate from galaxies ( which are concentrated in filaments ) into the voids .",
    "this leads to a picture in which a given set of galaxies enriches a progressively larger cosmic volume with decreasing redshift , and we predict that if low - density regions are enriched by winds from @xmath124 galaxies at @xmath76 , the median metallicity of low - density regions should be a very strong function of redshift .",
    "the scenario described here , enrichment of the igm by massive ( @xmath124 ) galaxies at modest ( @xmath76 ) redshift , is but one of several interpretations for the origin of metal in the ly@xmath8 forest .",
    "other possibilities , distinguished by epoch and mass scale , include enrichment by population iii stars at @xmath128 , or the disruption of low - mass protogalaxies at @xmath129 .",
    "how are we to decide which , if any , of these three scenarios is most relevant to the real universe ?    based on our modeling , we anticipate that these mechanisms will predict differences in the metal distribution of the igm that can be tested observationally .",
    "in addition to the mean enrichment , the dispersion in metallicity at a given overdensity and the trend of metallicity with overdensity can both be measured .",
    "it seems natural to expect that metal deposition at relatively higher redshift will lead to a rather different distribution of metals than that inferred from our analysis .",
    "thus , future modeling , combined with observational samples of increasingly large size , may discriminate between the various scenarios . to the extent that this goal can be realized , the metals discovered in the @xmath112 ly@xmath8",

    "<S> the primary effect limiting the enrichment of low - density ig gas in our scenario is then the travel time from high- to low - density regions , implying that the metallicity of low - density gas is a strong function of redshift . </S>"
