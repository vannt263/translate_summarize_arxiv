    "in a generic supergravity theory , the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses , gaugino masses and @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms are free parameters . on the other hand if the supergravity theory is the low energy limit of an orbifold compactificaion of the heterotic string then these parameters are calculable in principle @xcite since string theory has only one free parameter , namely the string scale .",
    "however , the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters depend on the moduli of the orbifold model ( including the dilaton expectation value ) and the values of the moduli can not be determined without a detailed knowledge of the non - peturbative superpotential probably responsible for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "one possible approach @xcite is to accept for the time being that we lack this detailed knowledge and to absorb this uncertainty into an angle , @xmath5 , which is a measure of the relative size of the auxiliary fields for the dilaton and the overall @xmath6 modulus ( with the vacuum energy taken to be zero ) .",
    "in such an approach @xcite the supersymmetric particle spectrum has been derived as a function of this angle @xmath5 when unification of gauge coupling constants at @xmath7 gev is due to large moduli dependent string loop corrections and also when it is due to extra matter states close to the unification scale . here , we shall explore the robustness of the qualitative features of the spectrum obtained in the former case when various assumptions about the orbifold model are varied .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the effect of making one or more of the following changes to the assumptions in brignole _",
    "et al_.  @xcite : using the modular weights allowed @xcite for states in the twisted sectors of those abelian orbifolds which possess three @xmath8 moduli , @xmath9 .",
    "then it is possible to adopt a single overall modulus model with @xmath10 as in ref.@xcite with all three moduli on the same footing if , as is the case in gaugino condensate models , only the @xmath8 moduli occur in the non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "the possible choices of modular weights are then further restricted by requiring that the string loop threshold corrections to the gauge coupling constants allow unification of all three observable sector gauge coupling constants at a single energy scale .",
    "the value of the overall modulus @xmath6 is determined by requiring that this energy scale is @xmath11 gev .",
    "this is an alternative to choosing the simplest set of modular weights @xcite which will achieve the gauge coupling unification without reference to any particular orbifold . adopting the values for the green - schwarz parameters , @xmath1 , suggested by the above orbifold models .",
    "taking account of the possible moduli dependence of the yukawa couplings when all three states are in twisted sectors of the orbifold . in the case",
    "that the @xmath2 parameter originates from khler potential mixing , using the moduli dependence of @xmath2 suggested by the discussion of ref.@xcite rather than taking @xmath2 to be moduli independent , and in addition , taking account of the radiative corrections to the tree level effective potential in calculating the higgs scalar expectaton values @xmath12 and @xmath13 which affect the supersymmetric particle spectrum and also in calculating the higgs scalar masses @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the effect of more than one independent modulus expectation value which has been considered elsewhere @xcite , nor do we consider the m - theory regime of strong ten dimensional string coupling @xcite for which gauge coupling constant unification at the ` observed ' energy scale may occur without large string loop threshold corrections if there is a large eleventh dimension @xcite .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "all possible choices of modular weights for the standard model states in abelian orbifold compactifications with three @xmath8 moduli @xmath9 are obtained .",
    "the choice is restricted by demanding consistency with gauge coupling constant unification with @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath6 is also given . in section 3 the soft supersymmetry breaking terms",
    "are presented as functions of the overall modulus @xmath6 and the angle @xmath5 introduced in ref.@xcite . in section 4 the relevant renormalisation group equations for the running of the coupling constants and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters from the unification scale to the electroweak scale are displayed and the strategy for choosing the various string theoretic parameters and ensuring the correct electroweak breaking scale is discussed . in section 5 the resulting supersymmetric particle spectrum",

    "further , the acceptable part of the spectrum is limited by the requirement of positive squared scalar masses at the string scale which confines it to the regions between the two pairs of vertical lines shown in the figure , centred on the dilaton dominated limits ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the part of the spectrum around @xmath149 is ruled out due to @xmath127 being unacceptably low and the electroweak symmetry is unbroken there .    as in ref.@xcite",
    ", there is a clear division of the spectrum into a heavy and a light group although now there is a far greater variation in masses as @xmath5 is varied than was the case in ref.@xcite .",
    "this latter effect is attributable directly to the magnitude of @xmath1 and the effect it has on the gaugino masses which feed through to all sparticles . at the dilaton",
    "dominated limit the spectrum is qualitatively similar to that in ref.@xcite but away from this limit we see that the gluino ( and squarks ) are often heavier than the heavy stop ( in @xcite the gluino mass was fixed ) . particularly noticeable , and attributable to @xmath150 , is the mass of the lightest neutralino ( which is mostly @xmath151 ) which often exceeds 100 gev .",
    "this is worth noting because , as seen in figure [ moda4 ] , on the left hand limit of the allowed region its role as the ` lightest supersymmetric particle ' is jeopardised in favour of the right selectron .",
    "this is why the d term has been included in @xmath140 ( it can add 10 gev or more ) .",
    "the lightest higgs , @xmath139 , is also in the region of 100 gev and the light chargino can be lighter than the sleptons .",
    "a change in @xmath111 will scale all masses ( except @xmath127 ) .",
    "decreasing @xmath111 narrows the allowed region by virtue of @xmath140 and @xmath135 becoming too light on the right hand edge , giving an approximate effective minimum of @xmath152 gev , below which the dilaton dominated limit is unreachable . increasing @xmath111 rapidly increases the gluino mass to way above the limit 1.5 tev . for @xmath153 gev",
    "even the dilaton dominated limit is excluded .",
    "the allowed regions may not be extended to the right significantly , even with a high gravitino mass because @xmath135 remains too light there .",
    "a variation in @xmath95 affects all masses due to its appearance in the one - loop effects and an increase in @xmath95 will increase all masses slightly .",
    "however adjustment of @xmath95 is restricted by @xmath127 and it may not deviate far from @xmath154 without pushing @xmath127 out of the experimental bounds .    a different choice of modular weights from table [ modws ] will not change the spectrum very much other than by changing the acceptable width at the string scale .",
    "the modular weights from line 3 of table [ modws ] are the least restrictive at the string scale , the ` heaviest ' weight being @xmath155 , and so the acceptable part of the spectrum is widened slightly , while lines 4 and 5 from table [ modws ] have the opposite effect .",
    "thus the spectrum displayed in figure [ moda4 ] is very typical and deviations from it are small .",
    "@xmath156    figure [ modb2 ] shows that spectrum obtained for a @xmath24 orbifold ( @xmath157 ) with @xmath78 as in ( [ muw ] ) has two valid regions .",
    "the inclusion of the derivatives of @xmath78 in @xmath74 is instrumental in obtaining this result , were they to be neglected we would obtain only one valid region similar to figure [ moda4 ] .",
    "each region is qualitatively similar to that shown in figure [ moda4 ] , although both regions are bounded on the right by @xmath127 becoming too low .",
    "the dilaton dominated limit is not reachable at @xmath158 for this reason , while that at @xmath149 is reachable .",
    "note that here @xmath95 can not deviate far from 0.9 without @xmath127 being pushed outside the experimental bounds .",
    "conversely , obtaining an acceptable @xmath127 beyond the displayed regions would require an unacceptably high value of @xmath95 .",
    "we also find @xmath159 gev for an acceptable spectrum , as before .    concerning the other form of the @xmath4 term , @xmath89 , which is only valid for the orbifold because it requires a @xmath16 plane ,",
    "an example is shown in figure [ modj2 ] .",
    "comparison with figure [ modb2 ] shows some differences . in the right hand region",
    "the @xmath138-@xmath139 splitting is increased and in both regions the @xmath136-@xmath137 splitting is reduced .",
    "there is near degeneracy between @xmath134 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the right hand region .",
    "the light group remains relatively unaffected , although the top quark is , on average , heavier in the left hand region than the right hand region . to obtain central values of @xmath127",
    "the left and right regions require @xmath160 respectively .",
    "the dilaton dominated limits at @xmath161 are respectively included and excluded as in figure [ modb2 ] .",
    "we have studied the supersymmetric particle spectrum in orbifold compactifications of string theory where unification of gauge coupling constants at @xmath162 gev is due to large moduli dependent string loop threshold corrections , making a number of changes to the assumptions in brignole _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in order to explore the robustness of the qualitative features of the spectrum obtained .",
    "the specific orbifold models considered here show that the inclusion of the derivatives of @xmath78 in @xmath74 is important in obtaining acceptable spectra in two separate regions and that it is also necessary for @xmath163 to obtain correct values for the top quark mass . for @xmath24 orbifold models",
    "there is then little resultant difference between the @xmath89 and @xmath74 mechanisms . for both mechanisms",
    "the gravitino mass is restricted approximately to the range 70 - 250 gev in order to satisfy the upper and lower mass limits imposed in @xmath164 .",
    "it is also apparent that the effects of the green - schwarz coefficient are not negligible . in the examples presented here ,",
    "@xmath150 is substantial enough to shift the spectrum away from the dilaton dominated limit and partly out of the regions allowed at the string scale resulting in a considerably narrower acceptable range for @xmath5 .",
    "the lightest neutralino is often heavier than usually assumed ( @xmath165100 gev as opposed to @xmath16550 gev @xcite ) , and can be of similar mass to ( or heavier than ) the light higgs and the right selectron .",
    "in addition @xmath150 induces a large variation in the masses as @xmath5 is varied , particularly for the heavy group . in principle",
    "this should make the goldstino angle , @xmath5 , easier to determine if sparticles are eventually discovered .",
    "we are grateful to george kraniotis for helpful discussions .",
    "this research was supported in part by pparc and p.s .",
    "was supported by a royal holloway studentship .",
