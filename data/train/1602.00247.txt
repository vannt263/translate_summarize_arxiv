    "simulation of dynamic fracture is a challenging problem because of the extremes of strain and strain - rate experienced by the material near a crack tip , and because of the inherent instabilities such as branching that characterize many applications .",
    "these considerations , as well as the incompatibility of partial differential equations ( pdes ) with discontinuities , have led to the formulation of specialized methods for the simulation of crack growth , especially in finite element analysis .",
    "these techniques include the extended finite element @xcite , @xcite , cohesive element @xcite , and phase field @xcite , @xcite , @xcite methods and have met with notable successes .",
    "the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics @xcite has been proposed as a generalization of the standard theory of solid mechanics that predicts the creation and growth of cracks . in this formulation crack dynamics is given directly by evolution equations for the deformation field eliminating the need for supplemental kinetic relations describing crack growth .",
    "the balance of linear momentum takes the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a neighborhood of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the density , @xmath4 is the displacement field , @xmath5 is the body force density field , and @xmath6 is a material - dependent function that represents the force density ( per unit volume squared ) that point @xmath7 exerts on @xmath2 as a result of the deformation .",
    "the radius @xmath8 of the neighborhood is referred to as the _",
    "the motivation for peridynamics is that all material points are subject to the same basic field equations , whether on or off of a discontinuity ; the equations also have a basis in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this paradigm , to the extent that it is successful , liberates analysts from the need to develop and implement supplementary equations that dictate the evolution of discontinuities .",
    "standard practice in peridynamics dictates that the nucleation and propagation of cracks requires the specification of a damage variable within the functional form of @xmath6 that irreversibly degrades or eliminates the pairwise force interaction between @xmath2 and its neighbor @xmath7 .",
    "this is referred to as breaking the _ bond _ between @xmath2 and @xmath7 . here",
    "the term `` bond '' is used only to indicate a force interaction between two material points @xmath2 and @xmath7 through some potential , whose value can depend on the deformations of other bonds as well . a wide variety of damage laws in peridynamics are possible , and often they contain parameters that can be calibrated to important experimental measurements such as critical energy release rate @xcite or the eshelby - rice @xmath9-integral @xcite .",
    "damage evolution in peridynamic mechanics can be cast in a consistent thermodynamic framework @xcite , including appropriate restrictions derived from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this general approach of using bond damage has met with notable successes in the simulation of dynamic fracture @xcite . however , because of the large number of bonds in a discrete formulation of , there is a cost associated with keeping track of bond damage , as well as the need to specify a bond damage evolution law .    in the present paper",
    ", we report on recent efforts to model cracks in peridynamics without a bond damage variable .",
    "the main innovation in the present paper is a nonconvex elastic material model for peridynamic mechanics that , under certain conditions , nucleates and evolves discontinuities spontaneously .",
    "this approach is rigorously shown to reproduce the most salient experimentally observed characteristic of brittle fracture  the nearly constant amount of energy consumed by a crack per unit area of crack growth ( the griffith crack model ) .",
    "our results further show that in spite of the strong nonlinearity of the material model , the resulting equation of motion is well - posed within a suitable function space , providing a mathematical context for which multiple interacting cracks can grow without recourse to supplemental kinetic relations . in the limit of small horizon @xmath8 ,",
    "the nonconvex peridynamic model recovers a limiting fracture evolution characterized by the classical pde of linear elasticity away from the cracks . the evolving fracture system for the limit dynamics is shown to have bounded griffith fracture energy described by a critical energy release rate obtained directly from the nonconvex peridynamic potential .",
    "these results bring the field of peridynamic mechanics closer to the goal of generalizing the conventional theory to model both continuous and discontinuous deformation using the same balance laws .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the _ bond strain _ , defined to be the change in the length of a bond as a result of deformation divided by its initial length .",
    "we assume that the displacements @xmath4 are small ( infinitesimal ) relative to the size of the body @xmath11 . under this hypothesis",
    "the strain between two points @xmath2 and @xmath7 under the displacement field @xmath4 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unit vector in the direction of the bond and @xmath14 is the dot product between two vectors .",
    "to describe the material response , assume that the force interaction between points @xmath2 and @xmath7 reversibly stores potential ( elastic ) energy , and that this energy depends only on the bond strain and the bond s undeformed length .",
    "the elastic energy density at a material point @xmath2 is assumed to be given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pairwise force potential per unit length between @xmath2 and @xmath7 and @xmath17 is the area ( in 2d ) or the volume ( in 3d ) of the neighborhood @xmath1 .",
    "the nonconvexity of the potential @xmath18 with respect to the strain @xmath10 distinguishes this material model from those previously considered in the peridynamic literature . by hamilton",
