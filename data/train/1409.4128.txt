    "let @xmath2 be a real random variable having no atom at 0 , zero mean and unit variance .",
    "our object of study is the random polynomial @xmath7 where @xmath1 are iid copies of @xmath2 .",
    "this polynomial is often referred to as kac s polynomial , and has been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "the study of real roots of random polynomials has a long history .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of real roots of @xmath4 , sometimes we use the notation @xmath9 to emphasize the dependence of @xmath8 on the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a random variable taking values in @xmath10 .",
    "the issue of estimating @xmath8 was already raised by waring as far back as 1782 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and has generated a large amount of literature , of which we give an ( incomplete and brief ) survey .",
    "one of the first estimates for @xmath8 was obtained by bloch and plya @xcite , who studied the case when @xmath2 is uniformly distributed in @xmath11 , and established the upper bound @xmath12 here and later we ll use the usual asymptotic notation @xmath13 or @xmath14 to denote the bound @xmath15 where @xmath6 is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the above bound of bloch and plya was not sharp , as it turned out later that @xmath3 has a remarkably small number of real roots . in a series of breakthrough papers @xcite in the early 1940s , littlewood and offord proved ( for many atom variables @xmath2 such as gaussian , bernoulli or uniform on @xmath17 $ ] ) that @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 , where we use @xmath20 to denote a quantity that goes to @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "around the same time , kac @xcite developed a general formula for the expectation of number of real roots @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability density for @xmath25 ad @xmath26 .",
    "in the gaussian case , one can easily evaluate the rhs and get @xmath27    for non - gaussian distributions , however , kac s formula is often very hard to evaluate and it took a considerable amount of work to extend to other distributions . in a subsequent paper @xcite ,",
    "kac himself handled the case when @xmath2 is uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath17 $ ] and stevens @xcite extended it further to cover a large class of @xmath2 having continuous and smooth distributions with certain regularity properties ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these papers relies on and the analytic properties of the distribution of @xmath2 .    for discrete distributions , does not appear useful and it took more than 10 years since kac s paper until erds and offord in 1956 @xcite found a completely new approach to handle the bernoulli case . for this case",
    ", they proved that with probability @xmath28 @xmath29    in the late 1960s and early 1970s , ibragimov and maslova @xcite successfully refined erds - offord s method to handle any variable @xmath2 with mean 0 .",
    "they proved that for any @xmath2 with mean zero which belong to the domain of attraction of the normal law , @xmath30    for related results , see also @xcite .",
    "few years later , maslova @xcite showed that if @xmath2 has mean zero and variance one and @xmath31 , then the variance of @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "other developments were made in the late 1980s by wilkins @xcite and in the early 1990s by edelman and kostlan @xcite , who evaluated the explicit integral in very carefully and provided a precise estimate for @xmath34 @xmath35    where @xmath36 is an explicit constant ( the value of an explicit , but complicated integral ) . as a matter of fact , one can even write @xmath20 as sum of explicit functions of @xmath37 , which gives a complete taylor expansion .",
    "the truly remarkable fact about is that the error term @xmath38 tends to a limit as @xmath37 tends to infinity .",
    "the question here is : is this a _ universal phenomenon _ , which holds for general random polynomials , or a special property of the gaussian one ?",
    "it is clear that the computation leading to is not applicable for general random polynomials , as the explicit formula in is available only in the gaussian case , thanks to the unitary invariance property of this particular distribution . for many natural variables , such as bernoulli ,",
    "there is little hope that such an explicit formula actually exists . as a matter of fact ,",
    "ibragimov - maslova s proof of their asymptotic result for general non - gaussian polynomials ( based on the earlier work of erds - offord ) is a tour - de - force . among others",
    ", they followed the erds - offord s idea of using the number of sign changes on a fixed sequence of points to approximate the number of roots .",
    "the error term in this approximation , by nature , has a be large ( at least a positive power of @xmath39 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", numerical evidence tends to support the conjecture that @xmath40 do go to a limit , as @xmath37 to tends to infinity .",
    "however , the situation is delicate as this limit seems to depend on the distribution of the atom variable @xmath2 and _ is not _",
    "universal ; see the numerical illustration below .     in all three cases .",
    "]     from the averages , and the curves seem to converge to different values . ]    in a recent work @xcite , the last two authors and oanh nguyen made a first step by showing that the error term in question is bounded .",
    "let @xmath2 be a random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 and bounded @xmath41-moment",
    ". then @xmath42 .    in this paper",
    ", we settle this problem in the affirmative for a large and natural class of distributions , as an application of a general theorem concerning the repulsion between real roots of kac s polynomials ( see the next section ) .",

    ". then @xmath51 where @xmath6 is an absolute constant depending on @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to mention that due to the abstract nature of our arguments , the exact value of @xmath6 is still unknown , and its determination remains a tantalizing question . in our favorite toy case",
    "when @xmath2 is bernoulli , computer simulation suggests that @xmath6 is around @xmath52 , but it looks already difficult to prove that @xmath53 ( say ) .",
    "now we are going to present the main technical contribution of our paper , which , together with some other tools , will yield theorem [ theorem : expectedvalue:2 ] as an application .",
    "the object of study here is the existence of double roots , or more generally , the repulsion between real roots of kac polynomials .",
    "multiple roots is a basic object in theoretical analysis .",
    "they also play an important role in practical computational problems .",
    "for example , it is a fundamental fact in numerical analysis that the running time of newton s method ( for finding real roots of a function ) decreases exponentially with the presence of a multiple or near multiple root ( i.e. , a place @xmath54 where both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are close to zero ) , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) .",
    "intuitively , one expects that a random polynomial does not have multiple or near multiple roots , with high probability .",
    "motivated by problems in complexity theory , researchers have confirmed this intuition for the case when @xmath2 is gaussian , in a more general setting ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the methods in these works rely on the invariance property of the gaussian distribution and do not extend to other natural distributions .",
    "we are going to introduce a new approach that enables us to fully understand the double root phenomenon , and consequently derive an optimal bound on the probability that a random polynomial has double or near double real roots .",
    "for the sake of presentation , let us first consider the toy case when @xmath2 is bernoulli .",
    "one expects that the probability of having double roots tends to 0 with @xmath37 ; the question is how fast ? to give a lower bound , let us consider @xmath57 , the probability that the polynomial has a double root at either @xmath58 or @xmath59 ( we stress that @xmath57 denotes one number ) .",
    "trivially , the double root probability is at least @xmath57 .",
    "a short consideration shows ( see appendix [ appendix:1 ] )    [ fact : arithmetic ] assume that @xmath60 s have the bernoulli distribution .",
    "then @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath21 otherwise .    we are now ready to state our first theorem , which asserts that in the @xmath62 case , the double root probability is dominating by @xmath57 , while in the other cases , this probability is very small .",
    "[ double roots of bernoully polynomials ] [ theorem : dbroot : ber ] let @xmath4 be a bernoulli polynomial .",
    "then @xmath63    theorem [ theorem : dbroot : ber ] is a special case of our main result below , which deals with near double roots of general random polynomials .",
    "[ main result : roots repulsion ] [ theorem : repulsion : uniform ] assume that @xmath64 are independent and all of them are either type i with the same fixed parameter @xmath43 , or type ii with uniform implicit constants ( which are fixed ) .",
    "then for any constant @xmath65 there exists a constant @xmath66 such that for all sufficiently large @xmath37 @xmath67 where @xmath57 denotes the probability that the polynomial has a double root at either @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear that in the type ii setting we have @xmath68 .",
    "also , it is not hard to show that @xmath69 for the type @xmath70 setting ( see claim  [ claim : anticoncentration ] . )",
    "our proof will provide more detailed information about the location of double and near double roots .",
    "for instance , in the discrete case , we will show that with overwhelming probability , any double ( or near double ) root , has to be very close to either 1 or @xmath59 .",
    "we present the precise statements in section [ section : prelim ] and with proofs in sections [ section : repulsion : general]-[section : repulsion : edge ] . as an application",
    ", we verify theorem [ theorem : expectedvalue:2 ] in section [ section : expectedvalue:2 ] .",

    "@xcite proved for random polynomials with the atom variable @xmath2 having support on @xmath71 that the probability of having double roots ( both real and complex ) is dominated by the probability of having double roots at @xmath72 .",
