    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in the lowest landau level ( ll ) at filling factors @xmath2 , with integral @xmath3 and @xmath4 , may be understood as an integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) in terms of composite fermions ( cfs ) .",
    "@xcite each cf consists of a bound state of one electron and a vortex - like excitation with vorticity @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 , in units of the electron charge .",
    "the cfs experience a reduced coupling @xmath7 to the external magnetic field @xmath8 and thus populate cf - lls with a cf filling factor @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the electronic density , and @xmath11 is the density of states of each cf - ll in terms of the cf magnetic length @xmath12 .",
    "the cf and electronic filling factors are related by @xmath13 .",
    "the fqhe arises when @xmath14 : because of the cf - ll separation , which is on the order of the characteristic coulomb energy @xmath15 , a finite energy is required to promote a particle to an upper cf - ll if the filling is changed .",
    "these particles become localized by residual impurities and therefore do not contribute to the electrical transport , giving rise to the observed plateaus in the hall resistance .",
    "experiments by pan _",
    "et al . _ have revealed a new class of fqhe states at filling factors such as @xmath16 , of which at least the 4/11 state is found to be spin - polarized .",
    "@xcite the existence of such states had been conjectured by mani and v.  klitzing based on the fractal structure and self - similarity of the hall resistance curve .",
    "@xcite it appears natural to interpret these states , found at cffilling factors @xmath17 , in terms of an iqhe of a second generation of cfs ( c@xmath18fs ) ; whereas the cfs in the lowest cf - ll ( @xmath19 ) remain inert , those in the partially filled @xmath20 level bind to some vortex - like excitation carrying @xmath21 additional flux quanta .",
    "this picture is reminiscent of the hierarchy scheme proposed by haldane and halperin , according to which laughlin quasiparticles @xcite might in principle form an incompressible liquid state if the interaction potential between these quasiparticles is sufficiently short - range . @xcite",
    "even though the new states may be classified within this scheme , theoretical studies seem to indicate that fully spin - polarized c@xmath18fs and even higher generations of cfs would not be stable .",
    "@xcite exact - diagonalization studies for the @xmath22 state show a gapped ground state only for @xmath23 electrons , which is at present the maximum electron number for such numerical investigations .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a numerical diagonalization with up to @xmath24 particles can be performed in the cf basis with a truncated hilbert space .",
    "@xcite within the latter formalism , a ground state with features of a fqhe state emerges for @xmath25 and @xmath26 particles , but not for @xmath27 , and @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is therefore ambiguous .",
    "lopez and fradkin investigated the topological stability of a fqhe state at @xmath28 in a chern - simons field - theory approach .",
    "@xcite in contrast to prior stability investigations by haldane , @xcite a spin - polarized state is found to be _ topologically stable _ , if interpreted in terms of c@xmath18fs .",
    "recently , we have derived a model of interacting cfs @xcite in the framework of the hamiltonian theory proposed by murthy and shankar .",
    "@xcite the involved transformations provide a mathematical basis for the self - similarity of the fqhe .",
    "@xcite here , we construct a c@xmath18f representation of this model , in analogy with the cf representation in the hamiltonian theory , by the restriction of the dynamics to the first excited cf - ll @xmath20 .",
    "we suppose the stability of fully spin - polarized c@xmath18f states and calculate their activation gaps as a function of the finite width of the two - dimensional electron system .",
    "in contrast to prior numerical analyses in the wave - function approach , the calculations are performed directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "inter - cf - ll excitations are taken into account and give rise to a screened effective interaction .",
    "the dielectric function , which is calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , is similar to the electronic case discussed by aleiner and glazman .",
    "@xcite    the structure of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "ii we present the model of interacting cfs and evaluate their effective interaction potential . the dielectric function due to inter - cf - ll excitations is derived in sec .",

    "iv we construct the c@xmath18f basis and calculate the activation gaps of the c@xmath18f states as a function of the finite width of the electron system .",
    "the resulting activation gap for @xmath28 is compared to the experimental estimate .",

    "the low - energy degrees of freedom are given by the hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "instead of representing the projected density operators @xmath32 in the usual electron basis , an alternative representation in terms of cfs is chosen in the hamiltonian theory of the fqhe : a `` preferred '' combination of the projected density and the density @xmath33 of the vortex - like object is introduced , @xmath34.@xcite this preferred combination plays the role of the cf density operator and may be expressed as @xmath35    where @xmath36 creates a cf in the @xmath37-th cf - ll with the guiding - center quantum number @xmath38 .",

    "one would simply need to replace the electronic by the cf interaction potential , @xmath54 , and take into account the renormalization of the magnetic length , @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast to the electronic case , inter - cf - ll excitations have to be considered explicitly in a dielectric function @xmath56 , which modifies the cf interaction potential , because the residual cf interactions are intrinsically on the same order of magnitude as the cf - ll separation - both energy scales are given by the coulomb interaction @xmath57 .    for the calculation of the dielectric function , we investigate inter - cf - ll excitations in the original hamiltonian ( [ equ001 ] ) in the cf basis .",
