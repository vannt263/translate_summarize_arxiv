    "our calculated value @xmath145 mev is comparable with that for the @xmath13 @xmath146 qbs , and is a factor of two larger than for the lowest @xmath143 qbs with @xmath147 and @xmath20 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath144 is bound by less than 10 mev with respect to the threshold for decay to a pair of @xmath15 @xmath17-like qbs .",
    "this apparent relatively weak binding of @xmath144 is owing to the restraining effect of handling self consistently the energy dependent @xmath21 interaction .",

    "in conclusion , we have performed calculations of three - body @xmath143 and four - body @xmath1 and @xmath9 qbs systems . using practically identical interactions to those used in the @xmath5 chiral model calculations by dot et al .",
    "@xcite , we were able to test our calculations for this qbs against theirs . given the low binding energy @xmath150 mev and sizable conversion width @xmath151 mev , it might be difficult to identify such a near - threshold qbs unambiguously in ongoing experimental searches .",
    "this situation gets further complicated by two additional factors : ( i ) the possible presence of a near - threshold @xmath6 qbs in the same charge state as the one in which @xmath5 is searched on , and ( ii ) additional two - nucleon absorption widths @xmath152 accounting for the poorly understood non - pionic processes @xmath153 . for @xmath5",

    "appreciable @xmath155-wave contributions to the @xmath5 width were also suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , but doubts have been recently expressed on the effectiveness of a @xmath155-wave @xmath124 interaction by testing its role in kaonic atoms @xcite .",
    "altogether , the widths of @xmath143 qbs are likely to be dominated by their conversion widths .    for the four - body qbs systems @xmath156 and @xmath12 we found relatively modest binding , of order 30 mev in both , with conversion widths ranging from about 30 mev for each of the @xmath156 qbs to about 80 mev for the lowest @xmath12 qbs .",
    "these systems , although somewhat more compact than @xmath5 , are not as compact as suggested by yamazaki et al . @xcite . their @xmath21 r.m.s .",
    "distances do not fall below that of the @xmath17-like @xmath21 qbs , and their @xmath3 r.m.s .",
    "distances exceed that of nuclear matter ( @xmath157 fm ) . for a conservative estimate of the absorption widths @xmath152 in these systems , we count the number of nucleons @xmath158 available to join a given @xmath21 correlated pair , one pair per each @xmath8 .",
    "this gives twice as large @xmath158 for each of the four - body systems ( @xmath159 ) with respect to @xmath5 ( @xmath160 ) .",

    "the energy dependence of the subthreshold @xmath21 effective interaction , constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite within a coupled channel chiral model , was found to be instrumental in restraining the binding of the four - body @xmath8 nuclear clusters through the self - consistency requirement derived here for these light systems .",
    "a strong @xmath21 interaction operates to form tightly bound compact structures , necessarily accompanied by large kinetic energies .",
    "this leads by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sqrts ] ) and ( [ eq : sqrtsnnkk ] ) to substantial values of the energy shift @xmath93 which give rise to weaker input @xmath21 interactions , resulting in less binding as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgl1 ] for @xmath12 .",
    "however , dispersive contributions to the binding energy of qbs can not be excluded .",
    "recent fits to kaonic atoms @xcite suggest that @xmath162 , so that these binding energies could reach values @xmath163 mev and @xmath164 mev . for heavier @xmath8-nuclear clusters where the nuclear density is closer to nuclear - matter density , a restraining mechanism similar to the one discussed here has been shown to be operative @xcite .",
    "other restraining , or saturation mechanisms are likely to be operative such as the increased @xmath98 repulsion upon adding @xmath8 mesons @xcite .",
