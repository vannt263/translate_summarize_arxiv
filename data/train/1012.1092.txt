    "it is widely believed that feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) during the epoch of galaxy formation is required to explain the relation between black hole and bulge mass / velocity dispersion @xcite , the deficit of bright galaxies in the galaxy luminosity function @xcite , and the completion of star formation in massive galaxies at epochs of redshift @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is envisaged that either radiation or outflows from a galactic nucleus impedes the infall of star - forming gas once the central black hole grows to a critical size .",
    "accordingly , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others , have appealed to the physics of either energy - driven or momentum - driven bubbles in order to explain the relationships between the mass of the black hole and the parameters of the host galaxy .    in order to model the galaxy luminosity function ,",
    "@xcite have utilized semi - analytic models based on the output of the millennium simulation , incorporating radio - mode feedback , coupled with a prescription for the accretion rate into the center of each evolving galaxy .",
    "their feedback prescription is motivated by the well - documented evidence for the effect of radio galaxies on cooling flow galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is also a growing literature on cosmological simulations in a @xmath3cdm cosmogony involving both dark matter and gas dynamics , which incorporate feedback from both supernovae ( sn ) and black holes , and which test scenarios of galaxy merging and growth @xcite . in simulations using the gadget-2 code",
    "@xcite the total number of sph particles representing the baryonic component exceeds 250 million , and the effective spatial dynamic range is an equally impressive @xmath4 per dimension .",
    "nevertheless , the best spatial resolution is about 2 kpc and does not resolve the spatial scales where important dynamical processes occur .",
    "this is highlighted by the prescriptions for black hole growth and feedback described , for example in the work by @xcite .",
    "accretion is described in terms of the bondi - hoyle accretion rate multiplied by a factor , which can be as large as @xmath5 .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that at sub - grid scales the density would be larger , and the real accretion rate would be appreciably higher . however , the higher densities and the consequent cooling and fragmentation on sub - grid kpc scales would create a multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) , the physics of which is not satisfactorily captured by the simulations . in particular , such a medium is porous , and the interaction between jets and the dense , potentially star - forming clouds of gas is complex , with radio - emitting plasma being able to channel through holes in the density distribution , rather than isotropically impacting a smooth distribution of dense gas as shown in previous work @xcite .    given that black - hole driven",
    "feedback occurs in bright galaxies , there does not appear to be a consensus on the type of feedback : how much agn power is involved , and does the feedback involve radiative or mechanical processes or both ? in their radio - mode model , @xcite",
    "attribute feedback to radio galaxies accreting at rates well below eddington , and for typical ellipticals , this means low - powered fanaroff - riley class i radio galaxies are the primary drivers of feedback . in @xcite the momentum for dispersing the circumnuclear gas comes from a quasar wind ; in @xcite the momentum of the outflow is provided by an eddington - limited radiation - driven wind ; in sph simulations the accretion rate , which is the ultimate power source for an outflow , can approach eddington values @xcite .    there is also an issue of what class of agn actually drives black hole feedback .",
    "the models by @xcite invoke low - powered radio galaxies .",
    "observers , however , have focused on powerful radio galaxies , mainly at @xmath6 ; in these galaxies there is evidence for substantial outflows of line - emitting gas and neutral gas driven by the radio jets @xcite .",
    "it is possible that there is a role for radio galaxies with a range of powers : powerful radio galaxies may be responsible for the establishment of the stellar mass at @xmath6 , and less powerful sources may be responsible for the maintenance of the stellar content through the inhibition of cooling flows @xcite .",
    "we also note that radio galaxies are mainly relevant to the elliptical galaxy population , and that the separate luminosity functions for early and late - type galaxies @xcite indicate the requirement for feedback in both populations .",
    "in this paper we consider the potential role of radio galaxies in agn feedback and address the following questions : ( 1 ) what jet power is required for the radio galaxy phase to have an important effect on inhibiting star formation in a given host , and ( 2 ) is the range of radio powers broad enough that radio galaxies could affect the entire distribution of bright ellipticals ? in this paper we present progress in answering these questions through simulations with a resolution of @xmath7 per computational cell .",
    "these simulations confront the sub - grid physics that current large scale sph simulations do not address . in particular , we consider the effect of powerful relativistic jets on a two - phase ism consisting of hot gas , in which is embedded a dense porous phase of warm gas .",
    "these simulations extend the simulations described in @xcite , in which a jet with a kinetic power of @xmath8 propagates through an inhomogeneous medium in the form of an almost keplerian fractal disk .",
    "it is evident from that simulation that in the geometry considered , jets of that power could not exert enough impact on the clouds to disperse them , and that the jets would not have a important effect on star formation in the core of the host galaxy . in the present simulations we consider jets with powers ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 propagating through a two - phase medium , in which the dense clouds are spherically distributed throughout a region @xmath9 in diameter .",
    "these initial data are meant to describe a typical protogalaxy , in which dense gas has accumulated in the core .",
    "the fractal distribution of the dense gas enables us to directly examine the effect of porosity on the evolution of potentially star - forming clouds .    in the following sections we describe the parameters of the simulations in more detail and then discuss our results",
    "in our simulations , we use the publicly available , open - source code flash @xcite version 3.2 , to which we have added code to incorporate radiative cooling of thermal gas and code to advance advected scalars in the relativistic hydrodynamic solver .",
    "details of the solver are in @xcite .",
    "we exploit the adaptive mesh capabilities of flash , utilizing up to seven levels of refinement ; this corresponds to a nominal cubical simulation grid of @xmath10 in physical dimensions , consisting of @xmath11 cells at maximum resolution .",
    "however , note that a restricted one parameter scaling of physical dimensions is possible @xcite .",
    "the relevant jet parameters , which are initiated and maintained constant at the boundary that is the jet inlet , are : the lorentz factor @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 is the jet velocity in units of the speed of light ; the proper density parameter , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the polytropic index , @xmath16 is the rest mass density , and @xmath17 is the pressure ; and the jet power . let @xmath18 be the jet cross - sectional area .",
    "the jet power is @xmath19 we adopt @xmath20 for both jet and ambient gas . in all simulations presented here , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the jet inlet is a circular region of area @xmath18 centered at @xmath23 with normal @xmath24 .",
    "the initial jet velocity is parallel to the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the boundary @xmath26 is reflective , apart from the jet inlet .",
    "all other boundaries of the simulation domain are designated as inflow / outflow boundaries .",
    "the two parameters describing the hot phase of the ism are the temperature , @xmath27 , which is fixed at @xmath28 , and the total number density @xmath29 .",
    "the pressure , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is boltzmann s constant , for the ism in each of the simulations is either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , typical of the ism in giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the distribution of dense , warm clouds is prescribed in similar fashion to that in @xcite , following work on terrestrial clouds by @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that , here , the average mass density is uniform , whereas in @xcite the average density is that of a near - keplerian disk . for completeness , we describe the other details of the cloud distribution used in this series of simulations :    1 .",
    "we begin by constructing a cube of density fluctuations in which the single point statistics of the density distribution are described by a log - normal distribution .",
    "the mean , @xmath34 , of the parent distribution is 1.0 , and the variance , @xmath35 , these values being consistent with starburst reddening and extinction models @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath36 is the same as that used in @xcite . in numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath37 and 35 for solenoidal ( divergence free ) and compressive ( curl free ) forcing respectively , so that our adopted value of 5 is closer to their solenoidal result .",
    "the power spectrum of the density distribution @xmath38 for the range of waves numbers @xmath39 and zero outside of this range . the parameter @xmath40 sets the maximum cloud size . for these simulations @xmath41 ( in cell units in fourier space ) and this value limits the maximum size of an individual cloud to approximately @xmath42 for 512 cells along each axis of the @xmath9 computational cube . limiting the cloud size to @xmath42 allows for appropriate coverage and variation of hot phase ism and warm phase ism along any path through the region of our simulation grid filled with clouds .",
    "this ensures that the spatial distribution of clouds is approximately isotropic , and that the jet plasma encounters a statistically significant numbers of clouds along its main axis of propagation . as a result ,",
    "the flow of the jet plasma through the hot phase is approximately isotropic .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is set by the resolution of the simulation .",
    "here @xmath44 and is equivalent to two computational cells . 3 .",
    "the parent , unit mean distribution is scaled by the mean particle density of warm clouds , @xmath45 ; this parameter is determined by the ratio of @xmath45 to @xmath29 .",
    "the temperature in each cell of the warm gas distribution is determined by pressure equilibrium with the hot gas .",
    "when the warm gas temperature exceeds @xmath46 ( in the lowest density parts of the distribution ) , it is deemed to be thermally unstable and is replaced by hot gas .",
    "this makes the gas porous .",
    "we can then define a volume filling factor , @xmath47 , of the warm phase by integrating over the log - normal density distribution above the critical density @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath50 is an atomic mass unit ( see also appendix  b of * ? ? ?",
    "+ for a given value of @xmath51 , the volume filling factor is determined by the ratio of the mean warm phase density to hot phase density , @xmath52 ; the larger this parameter the larger the filling factor .",
    "this log - normal , fractal , porous distribution of clouds is an important feature of the simulations presented here .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite identified porosity as a key parameter in their models of feedback - regulated star - formation , since the porosity determines the extent to which energy - driven bubbles generated by sn or agn activity are confined .",
    "the porosity in the two - phase ism employed in our simulations plays a similar role , in that it constrains the progress of the jet along its principal axis and ensures the confinement of the pressurized bubble for times much larger than the dynamical time of an unimpeded jet .",
    "+ the porosity of dense clouds is the primary reason for the differences in the evolution of the radio source and the differences in energy and momentum imparted by the jet to the ism between our simulations and those of a jet propagating into a uniform medium . 5 .",
    "the radial extent of the gas is truncated by a sphere of radius @xmath53 .",
    "hence , we are simulating the interaction of jets with warm gas within 12 core radii of the parent galaxy .",
    "this justifies the neglect of gravity .",
    "we include non - equilibrium , optically thin atomic cooling for @xmath54 @xcite ; for @xmath55 the cooling is set to zero .",
    "we use updated solar abundances @xcite .",
    "+ the non - equilibrium , cooling function is pre - calculated for a high temperature ( @xmath56 ) shock . the main reason for using such a function was outlined in   2.1 of @xcite and , for completeness , we summarize it here : following a shock there is a short - lived cooling spike as low - ionization material is suddenly shocked to a high temperature . in a numerically well - resolved shock",
    "this phase is short - lived and provides about 1% of the total cooling .",
    "however , in a simulation in which each shock is not well - resolved ( as is the case here ) this spike can dominate the cooling and the situation is exacerbated by the interpolation of intermediate temperatures at each cell . apart from the initial ( and unimportant ) cooling spike ,",
    "our adopted non - equilibrium cooling function is a good approximation to the cooling function of shocks for velocities above @xmath57 .",
    "since the cooling function is pre - calculated and interpolated within the code there are no additional computational costs associated with a non - equilibrium calculation .",
    "the utilization of an _ optically thin _",
    "cooling function also requires some comment , given the dense , reasonably extended regions that evolve within the simulations . consider a region with electron density @xmath58 and thickness @xmath59 .",
    "the electron scattering optical depth @xmath60 . in the simulations with the densest gas the initial average electron density @xmath61 so that the largest clouds with @xmath62 would be optically thin but verging on optically thick where the density is a factor of 10 above average . as a result of the radiative shocks , the electron density increases by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "hence , even some of the less dense regions could become optically thick to scattering .",
    "scattering alone is not enough to invalidate the assumption of optically thin cooling , and an admixture of dust is required to cause absorption . moreover , the cooling in such regions occurs before maximum density has been obtained , and photons emitted by cooling plasma following a radiative shock have an escape route through the lower density regions of the shock .",
    "in addition , the temperature of the gas in the cooling , optically thin region of a radiative shock would be so high that dust would be destroyed .",
    "hence , optically thin cooling is a reasonable first approximation , which _ may _ be limited in the largest clouds .",
    "more refined radiation hydrodynamic simulations , possibly involving larger clouds , may need to take optical depth effects into account .",

    "[ f : densitye ] ( simulation e ) is completely different : initially the jet is deflected in various directions as it floods through the porous screen of dense clouds , finding channels of least resistance and gradually dispersing the clouds through the effect of the ram pressure of the non - thermal plasma . in addition , the slower rate of progress of the jet traps the high pressure cocoon material ; a pseudo - spherical bubble is driven into the ism , and the dense clouds are driven outwards and dispersed as this bubble expands . some of the dispersed material is accelerated to speeds @xmath66 while the speed of the densest parts of the clouds reaches several hundred @xmath67 .",

    "a convenient approach for assessing the effects of agn feedback on galaxy formation is to examine the velocity imparted to gas , which could form new stars .",
    "the usual criterion for inhibition of further galaxy formation is that the velocities imparted to the clouds is greater than the velocity dispersion , @xmath68 , of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the clouds would be ejected to large radii but it does mean that the clouds would be highly dispersed within the potential well of the host galaxy .    in order to track the different gas components we use tracers , which are the mass concentration of that component in each cell .",

    "a number of patterns are immediately obvious from this diagram .",
    "consider first the sequence of simulations cefh .",
    "these have the same values of @xmath103 and warm cloud density , @xmath45 , and are ordered by decreasing jet power from @xmath1 down to @xmath104 .",

    "these simulations have a higher @xmath103 and the same ratio of cloud to ism densities and , thus , the same filling factor .",
    "the clouds are denser and harder to move , and in this sequence the critical value of the jet power to eddington ratio , @xmath81 , is higher at around @xmath107 .",
    "we have also conducted simulations , in which the filling factor is reduced by reducing the average density of the clouds for a fixed @xmath103 .",

    "the lower power jets do not break through as readily , and the confinement time of the non - thermal gas is sufficient to build up a large pressure , which accelerates the clouds .",
    "the results for even lower filling factors at all jet powers will be of interest but requires higher resolution simulations to prevent the clouds from becoming too pixelated .",

    "what is the effect on star formation when the ambient pressure increases as a result of the formation of the high - pressured radio lobe ?",
    "for example , in simulation f@xmath64 , the value of @xmath30 , within the lobe rises from @xmath123 to about @xmath124 , the critical mass decreases to about @xmath125 and jet induced starformation may be feasible .",
    "however , the overpressured radio lobe is a highly turbulent environment and it is also helpful to compare the collapse timescale of the cloud , @xmath126 to the ablation time scale @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the ablation velocity of cloud material .",
    "clouds are destroyed on a time scales of a few @xmath129 . if we allow the cloud density to increase by a maximal factor of 100 as a result of radiative shocks and adopt fiducial values for the other parameters we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 . for",
    "this extreme case one may expect star formation to occur . on the other hand ,",
    "a factor of 100 increase in density is high so that we expect that most clouds would be dispersed before they could gravitationally collapse to form stars .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite in their study of the effect of radio - lobes driven by jets with powers ranging from @xmath132 to @xmath1 interacting with a single cloud with a radius of @xmath133 .",
    "given these estimates , under what circumstances would we expect _ jet - induced _ rather that _ jet - inhibited _ star formation ? first",
    ", if the temperature of the clouds were lower than @xmath134 the critical mass for gravitational instability ( @xmath135 ) would also be lower .",
    "second , we can also speculate that the clouds towards the edge of the radio lobe would not be so strongly affected by the lower level of turbulence in that region but they are still initially affected by the overpressure of the radio lobe bow - shock .",
    "therefore it is possible that there may be some star formation in these regions .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this paper but they should be of interest in future work .      panels a and b in fig .",

    "the efficiency is quite high and , except for runs c@xmath64 and e@xmath64 , the efficiency is still increasing by the end of the simulation .",
    "all curves show a slight dip or inflection before steeply rising ; this feature occurs at the point where the jet plasma breaks out of the confining clouds .",
    "( in the simulations of lower powered jets , the break out is smoothed out because the non - thermal plasma breaks out everywhere almost simultaneously . )",
    "these curves show a decrease in efficiency with decreasing value of the ratio of jet power to cloud density ( @xmath136 ) . from the curves of @xmath91 as a function of time shown in panel c of fig .",
    "[ f : combi ] , we see that the maxima in @xmath91 occur just before jet break - out , which releases some of the pressure in the quasi - spherical bubble .",

    "these pairs of runs have the same values of @xmath136 and exhibit comparable maximum radial velocity dispersion .",
    "the rate of momentum transfer from the jet to the clouds can be an issue in this field , to which @xcite drew attention .",
    "for example , the range of cloud and jet parameters presented in @xcite indicates that the cloud momentum flux may exceed that of the jet .",
    "hence , it is useful to examine the momentum budget to see what can be expected from the observations .",
    "momentum is not as straightforward as energy since the momentum in a volume surrounding a moving cloud is affected by the pressure ( and magnetic stresses ) integrated over the bounding surface of that volume . in this case the shocked jet gas provides a large pressure as a result of the _ energy _ flux in the jet .",
    "therefore , in panel d of fig .",
    "[ f : combi ] , we present the mechanical advantage ( the ratio of the momentum in clouds to the jet momentum ) as a function of time in each simulation . in each case",
    "the mechanical advantage exceeds unity .",
    "note that the greatest mechanical advantage is achieved by the lowest power jets .",
    "low powered jets `` punch through '' the warm clouds more slowly , and the shocked jet gas spreads more effectively through the volume of warm clouds and has a greater relative effect on the cloud momentum .      in each of the simulations , the jet plasma , after a sufficiently long time , escapes the cloud region . the more powerful the jet is , and the lighter the clouds are , the more centrally collimated the outbreak of the plasma is .",
    "we end the simulations when the jet plasma reaches the domain boundaries , and boundary effects become noticeable .",
    "we may , nonetheless , speculate on the subsequent evolution of the system .    in the highest power jet simulations ,",
    "we see the jet breaking through along its principal propagation axis ( @xmath26 ) and piercing the energy bubble that was inflated during the flood - and - channel phase of evolution . except for runs g and h",
    ", the jets in all our simulations will eventually emerge in a similar fashion , inflating a second , more classically shaped radio lobe beyond the first quasi - spherical bubble to a distance depending on the jet power . in runs g and h",
    ", the jet may be trapped indefinitely in the cloud region .",
    "while the common notion is that hierarchical radio lobe structures are produced by recurrent jet activity @xcite , we note that they may also be produced by the randomized emergence of radio plasma from an inhomogeneous , porous ism .",
    "after the jet escapes along its principal propagation axis , the efficiencies in transfer of momentum and energy to the clouds drop quickly . this stage",
    "is already seen in runs c@xmath64 and e@xmath64 , and will occur at later times in the other runs ( except for g and h , if the jets in those runs remains trapped for the duration of their activity ) . while the clouds in our simulations are dispersed to high velocities , the host galaxy will retain most of the cloud material , except for a diffuse component comprising the high velocity tail in the distribution , which is concentrated along the jet axis near the region where the central jet breaks out . by the end of the runs , the clouds in all simulations have reached and passed their maximum value of @xmath91 .",
    "the suite of simulations presented in this paper strongly reinforce the importance of inhomogeneity in the consideration of jet interactions with the ism @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity has several important consequences : ( 1 ) it affects the early morphology of the radio source as a result of the interaction of the jet and lobe with the obstructing clouds .",
    "( 2 ) the radio source affects a much larger volume of the host galaxy because of the channeling of the jet flow in different directions .",
    "( 3 ) the shocked jet clouds are left in the wake of the non - thermal plasma and , as first noted by @xcite , would continue to emit shock excited line emission with the shocks driven by the high pressure gas in the non - thermal cocoon ; this shock - excited emission is in addition to the emission that may be driven by photoionization by the nucleus .",
    "( 4 ) the porosity of dense gas determines the ease with which a jet in a given host can disperse this gas , which is a potential source of new stars . in powerful sources , higher porosity gas is less easily dispersed but this trend is not evident for lower - powered ( @xmath138 ) jets .",
    "( 5 ) jets of all powers can exert a considerable feedback effect on their host galaxies , although lower - powered jets only play a role in the lower velocity dispersion hosts .",
    "brighter galaxies require more powerful jets to disperse dense clouds .",
    "( 6 ) the efficiency of transfer of kinetic energy from the jet to the dense gas is high .",
    "( 7 ) the efficiency of transfer of momentum to the clouds is also high with mechanical advantages considerably exceeding unity .",
    "inhomogeneity is therefore crucial when considering agn feedback on the kiloparsec scale , both for the interpretation of radio and optical emission - line morphology in radio sources , which may be generating feedback , and for incorporating the effect of jet - mediated feedback on host galaxies of different size into large scale simulations , in which the resolution @xmath139 .",
    "an important conclusion from these simulations is that jets with eddington efficiency @xmath106 are unlikely to have an effect on evolving galaxies when the pre - starforming gas exists in the form of clouds , which are relatively dense and cool compared to the hot ism .",
    "this critical value of @xmath81 is relevant for clouds with a high filling factor of 0.42 and a value of @xmath140 for the ism .",
    "we have shown that when the filling factor decreases or the pressure of the ism increases the critical value of @xmath81 increases , and values of @xmath141 are not unrealistic .",
    "the precise values of @xmath108 will have to await further higher resolution simulations with high porosity dense gas .",

    "<S> over cosmic time , galaxies grow through the hierarchical merging of smaller galaxies . however , the bright region of the galaxy luminosity function is incompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical merging , and it is believed that feedback from the central black hole in the host galaxies reduces the number of bright galaxies and regulates the co - evolution of black hole and host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> numerous simulations of galaxy evolution have attempted to include the physical effects of such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a kiloparsec . </S>",
    "<S> however , interactions between jets and the interstellar medium involve processes occurring on less than kiloparsec scales . in order to further the understanding of processes occurring on such scales , we present a suite of simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two - phase interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale of one kiloparsec . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer of energy and momentum to the interstellar medium is considerable , and we find that jets with powers in the range of @xmath0@xmath1 can inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the galaxy core . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of the ratio of the jet power to the eddington luminosity of the black hole , the pressure of the interstellar medium and the porosity of the dense gas . </S>"
