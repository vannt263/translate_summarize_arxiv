    "the exploitation of a high power coherent thz source as a part of the lcls - ii user facility has been proposed in the lcls - ii cdr @xcite .",
    "thz radiation pulses can be generated by the spent electron beam downstream of the x - ray undulator . in this way ,",
    "intrinsic synchronization with the x - ray pulses can be achieved .",
    "a first , natural application of this kind of photon beams is for the pump - probe experiments . through the combination of thz pump and x - ray probe , xfels would offer unique opportunities for studies of ultrafast surface chemistry and catalysis @xcite .",
    "also , the lcls team started an @xmath9 project on thz radiation production from the spent electron beam downstream of the lcls baseline undulator @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in that case , thz pulses are generated by inserting a thin beryllium foil into the electron beam . in this paper",
    "we describe a scheme for integrating such kind of radiation source at the european xfel facility @xcite .",
    "we begin our considerations with the generation of thz radiation from the spent electron beam downstream of the sase2 undulator in the electron beam - dump area .",
    "we then move to consider the transport of thz radiation pulses from the xfel beam dump - area to the experimental hall .",
    "this constitutes a challenge , because the thz output must propagate at least @xmath0 meters in the photon beam tunnel and in the experimental hall to reach the sase2 x - ray hutches .",
    "since thz beams are prone to significant diffraction , a suitable beam transport system must be provided to guide the beam along large distances maintaining it , at the same time , within a reasonable size .",
    "moreover , the thz beamline should be designed to obtain a large transmission efficiency for the radiation over a wide wavelength range .",
    "transmission of the thz beam can only be accomplished with quasi - optical techniques . in this paper , similarly as in @xcite , which focused on the lcls baseline , we propose to use an open beam waveguide such as an iris guide , that is made of periodically spaced metallic screens with holes , for transporting the thz beam at the european xfel .",
    "the eigenmodes of the iris guide have been calculated numerically for the first time by fox and li @xcite and later obtained analytically by vainstein @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we already presented a complete iris guide theory .",
    "in particular , the requirements on the accuracy of the iris alignment were studied . in order to efficiently couple radiation into the transmission line ,",
    "it is desirable to match the spatial pattern of the source radiation to the mode of the transmission line . to this end , it is advisable to generate radiation from the spent electron beam directly in the iris line with the same parameters used in transmission line . in this way , the source generates thz radiation pulses with a transverse mode that automatically matches the mode of the transmission line .",
    "the theory described in @xcite supports this choice of thz source .    in the present work we present a conceptual design for a thz edge radiation source at the european xfel .",
    "it includes an @xmath10 m - long electron beam vacuum chamber equipped with an iris line , and a @xmath0 m - long transmission line with the same parameters .",
    "the transmission line , which develops through the xtd7 distribution tunnel and field @xmath11 of the experimental hall , includes at least ten @xmath12-degrees turns with plane mirrors at @xmath13 degrees as functional components .",
    "it is possible to match incident and outgoing radiation without extra losses in these irregularities .",
    "the transport line introduces a path delay of about @xmath1 m between thz and x - ray pulses generated from the same electron bunch . since thz pump / x - ray probe experiments should be enabled , in order to cope with this delay we propose to exploit the unique bunch structure foreseen as baseline mode of operation at the european xfel , with @xmath2 ns electron bunch separation , together with an additional delay line in experimental hall fs ) rather than by the jitter between the electron bunches ( about @xmath14 fs ) . ] .",
    "the availability of any thz source at the european xfel facility should be complemented with the availability of a suitable thz beam transport system , which must guide the beam for distances in the @xmath15 meters range .",
    "the thz beam can only be transmitted with quasi - optical techniques . in particular , the idea of providing a periodic phase correction for the free- space beam , in order to compensate for its divergence , is very natural . in the 1960s",
    "numerous attempts of designing various quasi - optical transmission lines were reported .",
    "in particular , it was proposed to use open beam waveguides such as lens guides , mirror guides , and iris guides @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the competition among different proposals ended with the victory of mirror guides , still in use today for example for plasma heating @xcite .",
    "focusing of the thz beam can only be provided with reflective optics since lenses made of any material would reflect and absorb all radiation at long distances .",
    "[ t1 ] ( a ) shows the optical arrangement of the transport system based on the use of a mirror guide . each focusing unit is composed by two matched copper mirrors .",
    "the mirrors are separated in such a way that the incident angle is sufficiently small to minimize astigmatism .",
    "existing mirror guides are characterized by a maximal length of about 40 - 60 m @xcite . as discussed above , at",
    "european xfel facility scientists need a beam transport system working for significantly longer distances , and the advantages of a mirror - guide based transport system are not evident .    in this paper",
    "we propose , as an alternative to the mirror line solution , to use an iris line , fig .",
    "[ t1 ] ( b ) .",
    "iris lines are characterized by a low attenuation of the fundamental mode , self - filtering of high order modes , wide operational wavelength range and mechanical integrity of the structure .",
    "the first investigation of the influence of diffraction effects on the formation of the field eigenmodes in an iris line was carried out by fox and li using physical optics techniques @xcite .",
    "a very different and mathematically solid approach to the same problem was introduced by vainstein @xcite .",
    "his studies are based on direct solution of maxwell equations .",
    "an analysis of diffraction and reflection from the iris edges allowed vainstein to derive for the first time analytic expressions for field distribution and mode losses in iris guides .",
    "an infinite , discrete set of eigenfunctions with corresponding complex eigenvalues can be found .",
    "this set of modes comprises leaky modes which are similar albeit not identical to modes of microwave waveguide with resistive walls .",
    "for instance , one can find that iris line modes , in contrast with microwave waveguide leaky modes , are independent of the polarization of the radiation .",
    "consider an axially symmetric iris guide with inner radius @xmath16 and distance between the two screens @xmath17 , and call @xmath18 the temporal fourier transform of the transverse electric field of the radiation in the guide .",
    "since the transverse size of the radiation is much larger than the reduced wavelength @xmath19 , the field envelope @xmath20 $ ] turns out to be a slowly varying function of the longitudinal coordinate @xmath21 with respect to the wavelength , and it obeys the paraxial maxwell equation .",

    "we obtain the following expression for @xmath39 :    @xmath40    for the eigenmode with transverse wavenumber @xmath37 , the fraction of the radiation power losses per transit of one iris is given by    @xmath41    the relative loss of the @xmath34-th mode of order @xmath35 after traveling for a distance @xmath21 is therefore given by    @xmath42    due to the exponential dependence on @xmath43 , only the lower order modes tend to survive .",
    "note that the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ loss ] ) depends on the distance between two irises , @xmath17 , only weakly as @xmath44 , while there is a much stronger dependence on @xmath45 and @xmath16 .",
    "as already mentioned , an iris line constitutes a suitable thz beam transport system for the european xfel .",
    "for example , calculations indicate that the losses of the principal mode at @xmath46 m , @xmath47 cm and @xmath48 cm should be in the order of @xmath49 after traveling for a distance @xmath50 m. the transfer line pipe diameter is estimated to be @xmath1 cm .",
    "it is therefore technically feasible to install such transfer line inside the distribution tunnel xtd7 .",
    "however , as discussed before , in order to efficiently couple radiation into the transmission line , one needs to match the spatial pattern of the source radiation to the mode of the transmission line .",
    "let us consider a coherent edge radiation source in the thz range , which is relatively simple to implement at the european xfel .",
    "a setup where edge radiation is formed with the help of upstream and downstream metallic screens is shown in fig .",
    "the edge radiation from the upstream screen is extracted by the downstream screen , which acts as a mirror , and is sent to the iris transmission line .",
    "the length of straight section between upstream screen and mirror plays the role of the length of the insertion device for edge radiation ( see for example @xcite for a review on these matters ) . the matching problem is easily solved if the thz source is equipped with an iris line as well .",
    "when dealing with a setup where thz radiation from an ultra relativistic electron beam is extracted by a mirror , one usually talks about backward transition radiation ( btr ) .",
    "the main problem to solve is the specification of the electric field distribution at some position where the mirror is present . it should be stressed that the specification of the field at the mirror position must be considered as the first step to the specification of the field at the sample position .",
    "such first step is considered separately , because the field at the mirror position is independent of the type of mirror and outcoupling optics .",
    "once the field at the mirror position is known , the problem of specification of the field at the sample position can be solved for example with the help of physical optics techniques .",
    "let us discuss the problem of field characterization at the mirror position in more detail . when electrons are in unbounded space and come from an infinitely long straight line , the field distribution in the mirror plane can be calculated analytically following ginzburg and frank @xcite . in most practical cases , however , the ginzburg - frank equation is not applicable",
    "because two basic assumptions of the analytical derivation are not fulfilled : the electron beam is moving inside the metallic vacuum chamber , which effectively acts like an overmoded waveguide , and the straight line has a finite length with a bending magnet at the upstream end .",
    "it is known that ginzburg - frank theory is the limiting case of the more general theory of edge radiation in unbounded space . for a review on these matters",
    "see , among others , @xcite . for a very recent review on edge radiation and further references",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "emission of edge radiation in the presence of metallic boundaries has been a much less - treated subject in literature , compared to the unbounded space case . to the best of our knowledge , there is only one article reporting on edge radiation from electrons in a homogeneous metallic overmode waveguide , in particular with circular cross - section @xcite .",
    "the method described in @xcite is therefore capable of treating realistic experimental setups . in @xcite",
    "we applied the method described in @xcite to the case of an iris guide .    to fix ideas",
    "we focus our attention on the setup in fig .",
    "electrons travel through the usual edge radiation setup .",
    "the difference is that now we account for the presence of the iris guide along the straight section .",
    "since electrons pass through an upstream edge screen , one may assume that the iris guide starts at the upstream screen position .",
    "one should calculate the field distribution at the mirror position , which should be subsequently propagated to the experimental hall .",
    "the presence of an upstream edge screen seems at first glance not necessary , because electrons come in any case from the straight section .",
    "however , due to variations of the vacuum chamber cross - section upstream of the edge radiation setup , characterization of the field distribution at the upstream open - end of the iris guide is problematic . in spite of this",
    ", the electric field of the electron beam in the plane immediately behind the upstream screen can be well defined as zero , leading to extra simplifications . in this case",
    "we deal with a well - defined problem , and this allow us to characterize the field distribution at the end of the iris guide in the mirror plane .    in the case of the thz source at the european xfel ,",
    "the electron beam transverse size is much smaller than the diffraction size .",
    "this means that , as pertains the characterization of the thz pulses , the electron beam can be modeled as a filament beam . in this case",
    "the electron beam current is made up of moving electrons randomly arriving at the entrance of the iris guide , and obeying    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the dirac delta function , @xmath53 is the electron charge , @xmath54 is number of electrons in a bunch , and @xmath55 is the random arrival time of the @xmath56-th electron at the undulator entrance .",

    ". such solution consists in the extension of the proposed method to a higher charge mode of operation ( up to @xmath113 nc ) , which is within the possibilities of the european xfel accelerator complex .",
    "it is hoped that future research may extend the thz source performance to a few gw power level .",
