    "it is roughly a decade since the @xmath3 , now known as the @xmath4 , was discovered by the mark iii collaboration in @xmath9 radiative decays to @xmath10 and @xmath11 final states @xcite .",
    "its most interesting property , which attracted considerable attention , was its narrow width of roughly 30  mev . because the width was inconsistent with expectations for a conventional @xmath12 meson with such a large mass , the @xmath13 s discovery led to speculation that it might be a higgs boson @xcite , a bound state of coloured scalars @xcite , a four quark state @xcite , a @xmath14 bound state @xcite , a hybrid @xcite , or a glueball @xcite . despite the prevailing wisdom , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the properties of the @xmath3 could be consistent with those of a conventional meson : the l=3 @xmath2 meson with @xmath15 or @xmath16 .    in the original analysis of l=3 @xmath2 properties",
    "it was shown that of the @xmath12 states with the appropriate @xmath17 quantum numbers only the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 states of the first l=3 multiplet have masses consistent with the @xmath3 @xcite . according to this analysis",
    "these two states were exceptional in that they have a limited number of available decay modes which are all relatively weak .",
    "however , the analysis was not exhaustive in that it did not calculate the decay widths to all possible final states .",
    "in particular it made the assumption , which we will see to be incorrect , that the decays to an @xmath18 meson and a @xmath19 or @xmath20 were small on the basis of phase space arguments alone .",
    "to further complicate the discussion , more recent experiments have observed a hadronic state decaying to @xmath21 in different reactions and with different properties .",
    "the various experimental results relevant to the @xmath3 are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the most recent measurement of the @xmath3 properties by the bes collaboration @xcite indicates that its decays are approximately flavour symmetric giving support to the glueball interpretation . at the same time , although the narrow @xmath3 was not seen in @xmath9 radiative decays by the dm2 experiment despite the fact that dm2 has slightly higher statistics , dm2 did observe a broader state decaying into @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if all the experiments are taken at face value the overall picture is confused and contradictory .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the nature of the @xmath22 meson and calculate the partial widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 states to all ozi - allowed 2-body final states allowed by phase space . to give a measure of the reliability of our analysis we calculate the widths using both the @xmath23 decay model ( often referred to as the quark - pair creation decay model ) @xcite and the flux - tube breaking decay model @xcite . as an additional consistency check we calculated several partial widths using the pseudoscalar decay model @xcite .",
    "our goal is to shed some light on the nature of the @xmath3 by comparing the quark model predictions for the hadronic widths to the various experimental results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly outline the models of hadron decays and the fitting of the parameters of the models .",
    "we relegate the details to the appendices .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we present the results of our calculations for the @xmath24 mesons and discuss our results . in the final section we attempt to make sense of the various contradictory experimental results and put forward our interpretation along with some suggested measurements which may clear up the situation .",
    "the quark model has proven to be a useful tool to describe the properties of hadrons .",
    "the quark model has successfully described weak , electromagnetic , and strong couplings . in some cases",
    "we will use simplified meson wavefunctions which have been used elsewhere to describe hadronic decays @xcite while in other cases we will use more complicated wavefunctions from a relativized quark model which includes one - gluon exchange and a linear confining potential @xcite .",
    "the strong decay analysis was performed using the qcd based flux - tube breaking model @xcite .",
    "it has the attractive feature of describing decay rates to all possible final states in terms of just one fitted parameter .",
    "we also include results for the @xmath23 model , often referred to as the quark - pair creation model @xcite , which is a limiting case of the flux - tube breaking model and which greatly simplifies the calculations and gives similar results . as a final check we calculated some partial widths using the pseudoscalar emission model @xcite and confirmed that it also gave results similar to those of the flux - tube breaking model .",
    "the @xmath23 model @xcite is applicable to ozi - allowed strong decays of a meson into two other mesons , as well as the two - body strong decays of baryons and other hadrons .",
    "meson decay occurs when a quark - antiquark pair is produced from the vacuum in a state suitable for quark rearrangement to occur , as in fig .",
    "[ 3p0decay ] .",
    "the created pair will have the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath23 .",
    "there is one undetermined parameter @xmath25 in the model - it represents the probability that a quark - antiquark pair will be created from the vacuum .",
    "the rest of the model is just the description of the overlap of the initial meson ( a ) and the created pair with the two final mesons ( b , c ) , to calculate the probability that rearrangement ( and hence decay ) will occur .",
    "a brief description of the model is included in appendix [ appa ] , and the techniques by which the calculations were performed are discussed in appendices [ appc ] and [ appd ] .      in the flux - tube picture",
    "a meson consists of a quark and antiquark connected by a tube of chromoelectric flux , which is treated as a vibrating string . for mesons",
    "the string is in its vibrational ground state .",
    "vibrational excitations of the string would correspond to a type of meson hybrid , particles whose existence have not yet been confirmed .",
    "the flux - tube breaking decay model @xcite is similar to the @xmath23 model , but extends it by considering the actual dynamics of the flux - tubes .",
    "this is done by including a factor representing the overlap of the flux - tube of the initial meson with those of the two outgoing mesons .",
    "a brief review of the model is given in appendix [ appb ] , and the techniques by which the calculations were performed are discussed in appendices [ appc ] and [ appd ] .      the point of these calculations is to obtain a reliable estimate of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 meson decay widths .",
    "to do so we considered several variations of the flux - tube breaking model . by seeing how much the results vary under the various assumptions we can estimate the reliability of the predictions .",
    "the first variation lies with the normalization of the mock meson wavefunctions and the phase space used to calculate the decay widths @xcite . in the appendices we have normalized the mock meson wavefunctions relativistically to @xmath26 and used relativistic phase space , which leads to a factor of @xmath27 in the final expression for the width in the centre of mass frame .",
    "we will refer to this as relativistic phase space / normalization ( rpsn ) . however , there are arguments @xcite that heavy quark effective theory fixes the assumptions in the mock meson prescription and suggests that the energy factor be replaced by @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 are the calculated masses of the meson @xmath30 in a spin - independent quark - antiquark potential @xcite .",
    "( in other words @xmath29 is given by the hyperfine averaged mass that is equal to the centre of gravity of the triplet and singlet masses of a multiplet of given @xmath31 . )",
    "we will refer to this as the kokoski - isgur phase space / normalization ( kipsn ) .",
    "the second variation in our results is the choice of wavefunctions .",
    "we calculate decay widths for two cases . in the first we use simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wavefunctions with a common oscillator parameter for all mesons . in the second case",
    "we use the wavefunctions , calculated in a relativized quark model , of ref .",
    "@xcite which we will label rqm . in all we looked at six cases : the @xmath23 model using the sho wavefunctions , the flux - tube breaking model again using the sho wavefunctions , and the flux - tube breaking model using the rqm wavefunctions of ref .",
    "@xcite ; in all three cases we used both choices of phase space / normalization .",
    "some comments about the details of the calculations are in order . for the sho wavefunctions",
    ", we took for the oscillator parameter @xmath32  mev which is the value used by kokoski and isgur @xcite .",
    "however , different quark models find different values of @xmath33 so that there is the question of the sensitivity of our results to @xmath33 .",
    "we will address this issue below .",
    "we used quark masses in the ratio @xmath34  this differs from the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which ignored the strange - quark mass difference . in the rqm wavefunctions",
    "these parameters are already set  the values of @xmath33 were found individually for each meson , and the quark masses were fitted : @xmath35  mev , @xmath36  mev , and @xmath37  mev .",
    "we have treated all mesons as narrow resonances , and have ignored mass differences between members of the same isospin multiplet . where the charged and neutral kaon mass difference is significant to the phase space .",
    "] masses were taken from the review of particle properties 1994 @xcite if the state was included in their meson summary table .",
    "@xmath38 state  see table [ table4 ] . ] if it was not , then the masses predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite were used .",
    "( this includes the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 mesons : 2240  mev and 2200  mev respectively . )",
    "meson flavour wavefunctions were also taken from ref .",
    "@xcite - for the isoscalars we assumed ideal mixing ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , except for the radial ground state pseudoscalars , where we assumed perfect mixing ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "we fitted @xmath25 , the one undetermined parameter of the model , in a global least squares fit of 28 of the best known meson decays .",
    "( we minimized the quantity defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the experimental error . ) the experimental values for these decays and the fitted values for the six cases are listed in table [ table2 ] . to give a more descriptive picture of the results we plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , on a logarithmic scale , the ratio of the fitted values to the experimental values . from table [ table2 ] one can see that the results for the @xmath23 and flux - tube breaking models for the sho wavefunctions are very similar which seems particularly sensitive to the model . ] .",
    "we therefore only plotted the @xmath23 model results using the sho wavefunctions and the flux - tube breaking model results for the rqm wavefunctions .",
    "a reference line is drawn in each case for @xmath45 to guide the eye .",
    "since all the partial widths are proportional to @xmath46 , using a different fit strategy rescales @xmath25 .",
    "this is equivalent to simply shifting all points on the plot simultaneously making it easy to visualize any change in agreement for specific decays .",
    "the kipsn gives a better overall fit to the data .",
    "even so , certain decays , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for example , are fit much better using the rpsn .",
    "for both the rpsn and kipsn one can see in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] that a significant number of the decays differ from the experimental values by factors of two or more .",
    "decays with two pseudoscalars in the final state tend to do better with the kipsn but the kipsn generally underestimates decays of high l mesons with vector mesons in the final states . on the other hand the rpsn tends to overestimate decays with two pseudoscalars in the final states .",
    "similar observations can be made for the flux - tube breaking model using the rqm wavefunctions .",
    "having said all this we stress that these are only general observations and exceptions can be found to any of them in table [ table2 ] .",
    "one must therefore be very careful not to take the predictions at face value but should try if possible to compare the predicted decay to a similar one that is experimentally well known .",
    "finally , we consider the sensitivity of our results to @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to the fits discussed above , we performed simultaneous fits of both @xmath25 and @xmath33 to the 28 decay widths for both the rpsn and the kipsn .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath25 and @xmath33 are 13.4 and 481  mev respectively for rpsn and 5.60 and 371  mev respectively for kipsn . in both cases",
    "the overall fits improved slightly , with some widths in better agreement and some in worse agreement with experiment when compared to the fits for @xmath49  mev . however , the fitted widths of the most relevant @xmath6 decays improve slightly for rpsn but show mixed results for kipsn .",
    "we also redid our fits of @xmath25 to the decay widths for @xmath50  gev and @xmath51  gev .",
    "for @xmath50  mev the overall fit improves slightly for kipsn although the predicted @xmath52 decay widths are a little worse and the @xmath53 widths are a little better . for rpsn the overall fit is a little worse as are the @xmath6 decays . for @xmath51",
    "mev the overall fit with kipsn becomes a little worse as does the fitted @xmath6 widths while for rpsn the overall fit and fitted @xmath6 widths become a little better .",
    "we conclude that while there is some sensitivity to @xmath33 , the results for modest changes in @xmath33 ( including the @xmath33 we obtain by fitting @xmath25 and @xmath33 simultaneously ) are consistent with those for @xmath49  mev within the overall uncertainty we assign to our results .",
    "it should be stressed that it is not sufficient to simply change @xmath33 but that a new value of @xmath25 must be fitted to the experimental widths included in our fit .",
    "using the @xmath25 s obtained from our fit we calculated all kinematically allowed partial widths for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 meson decays .",
    "the results are given in tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "for the @xmath6 state the main decay modes are : @xmath55    for the kipsn and the sho wavefunctions the total width is 132  mev with the @xmath23 model . for this set of assumptions",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 modes are probably reasonably good estimates . however , the decay widths to @xmath7 and @xmath8 are likely to be larger than the predictions . on this basis",
    "it does not seem likely to us that the @xmath58 width is less than the predicted total width by a factor of two or more , i.e. we do not expect it to be less than about 70  mev . if anything , we would expect it to be larger than the predicted width , i.e. @xmath59  mev .    for the @xmath5 state we obtain results similar to the @xmath6 state for the @xmath21 , @xmath60 , and @xmath8 modes .",
    "however , the @xmath5 also has large partial widths to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 is the dominant decay mode .",
    "it is large in all variations of the calculation we give in table iv .",
    "the most closely related decay in our fit is the decay @xmath65 which is relatively large and is well reproduced by the ki normalization and sho wavefunction case .",
    "the total width for this case is @xmath66  mev .",
    "state with a large total width of @xmath67  mev which could be associated with the strange meson partner of the @xmath68 meson @xcite ] even if this width is overestimated by a factor of two , it would still be too large to identify with the @xmath3 .",
    "although this result appears surprising it has a straightforward explanation . examining table [ table4 ] ,",
    "the lowest angular momentum final states in @xmath69 decay are p - waves .",
    "all of these decays are relatively broad but the @xmath70 is the p - wave decay with the largest available phase space .",
    "in fact , one could almost order the p - wave decays using phase space alone .",
    "the analogous decay of the @xmath58 is in an f - wave and therefore is subject to a larger angular momentum barrier .",
    "the lowest angular momentum partial wave for @xmath58 decays is a d - wave which although it has the largest partial width of all @xmath58 decays is still smaller than the p - wave @xmath69 decay .    as another measure of the reliability of these predictions we calculated the widths of the @xmath71 and @xmath52 mesons ( the @xmath6 @xmath19-like and non - strange isovector mesons , respectively ) .",
    "the results for all significant kinematically allowed final states are given for the @xmath23 model using sho wavefunctions in tables [ table5 ] and [ table6 ] respectively .",
    "the results are consistent with the general fit results given in table [ table2 ] and fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . in general , the widths calculated using rpsn tend to be larger and those calculated using the kipsn tend to be smaller .",
    "more specifically , decays to two pseudoscalar mesons using rpsn are generally overestimated while the results calculated using kipsn are in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "there is no pattern for the decays to two vector final states . the decay @xmath72 is greatly overestimated using rpsn but is in good agreement using kipsn .",
    "in contrast , the predicted decay @xmath48 agrees well using rpsn but is greatly underestimated using kipsn .",
    "the total widths tend to be overestimated using rpsn but are underestimated using kipsn , both to varying degrees .",
    "the only conclusion we can draw from these results is that the total width probably lies between the two estimates but it is difficult to guess if it is closer to the lower or upper value .",
    "finally , in table vii we give the predicted total widths for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 states for the different values of @xmath33 considered in the previous section .",
    "although they vary considerably , by roughly a factor of 2 going from @xmath50  mev to @xmath51  gev ( except for the @xmath73 with rpsn which varies by a factor of 3 ) , these values are consistent within the large uncertainties we assign to our results .",
    "the motivation for this paper was to re - examine the possibility that the @xmath3 is an l=3 @xmath2 meson .",
    "this question is especially timely given the recent bes measurements of a narrow resonance with a mass of 2.2  gev seen in @xmath9 radiative decays .",
    "to do so we calculated all kinematically allowed hadronic decays of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2 states using several variations of the flux - tube breaking decay model .",
    "it appears very unlikely that the @xmath3 can be understood as the @xmath5 @xmath2 state .",
    "all variations of our calculation indicate that the @xmath5 @xmath2 is rather broad , @xmath74  mev .",
    "the dominant decay mode is the difficult to reconstruct @xmath61 final state .",
    "other final states with large branching ratios are @xmath75 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath63 , @xmath21 , and @xmath64 .",
    "it is more likely that the @xmath76 state can be associated with the @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated width is @xmath77  mev but given the uncertainties of the models it is possible , although perhaps unlikely , that the width could be small enough to be compatible with the width reported in the review of particle properties 1994 @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the largest decay modes are to @xmath8 , @xmath78 , @xmath7 , and @xmath79 .",
    "since only the @xmath21 final state has been observed an important test of this interpretation would be the observation of some of these other modes .",
    "there are , however , some problems with the @xmath76 identification of the @xmath3 . foremost is the flavour symmetric decay patterns recently measured by the bes collaboration @xcite .",
    "these results contradict the expectations for a conventional @xmath2 meson .",
    "second is the wide range of measured widths for this state .",
    "although the review of particle properties 1994 lists an average width of @xmath80  mev the widths measured in hadron production experiments , lass and e147 , are larger while those measured in @xmath9 radiative decay tend to be narrow .",
    "the exception is the dm2 experiment which does not see , in @xmath9 radiative decay , a narrow state in @xmath81 but does observe a relatively broad state at this mass .    to account for these contradictions",
    "we propose a second explanation of what is being observed in this mass region  that two different hadron states are observed , a narrow state produced in @xmath9 radiative decay and a broader state produced in hadron beam experiments .",
    "the broader state would be identified with the @xmath76 state .",
    "the predicted width is consistent with the quark model predictions and the lass collaboration shows evidence that its quantum numbers are @xmath16 .",
    "we would then identify the narrow hadron state observed in the gluon rich @xmath9 radiative decays as a glueball candidate predicted by lattice gauge theory results @xcite .",
    "recent lattice results indicate that glueballs may be narrower than one might naively expect @xcite .",
    "the scalar glueball width is expected to be less that 200 mev and one might expect a higher angular momentum state to be even narrower .",
    "the narrow state is not seen in hadron beam production because it is narrow , is produced weakly in these experiments through intermediate gluons , and is hidden by the @xmath2 state .",
    "conversely , the broader state is not seen in @xmath9 radiative decays since this mode preferentially produces states with a high glue content .",
    "crucial to this explanation is the experimental verification of the bes results on the flavour symmetric couplings of the state produced in @xmath9 radiative decay and the observation of other decay modes for the broader state in addition to the theoretical verification that the predicted tensor glueball is as narrow as the observed width .",
    "the @xmath3 has been a longstanding source of controversy .",
    "it is a dramatic reminder that there still is much that we do nt understand about hadron spectroscopy and demonstrates the need for further experimental results to better understand this subject and ultimately better understand non - abelian gauge theories , of which qcd is but one example .",

    "the result of a recoupling calculation is @xmath134 note that this can be done for any value of @xmath135 ; alternatively , one could sum over @xmath135 and divide by @xmath136 , on the right side .",
    "the jacob - wick formula relates the partial wave basis @xmath126 to the helicity basis @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the helicities of b and c , respectively . to use it",
    "we must first convert the basis that we calculate with to the helicity basis .",
    "this is done by first choosing @xmath140 to lie along the positive z axis ( in the cm frame still ) , so that @xmath141 and @xmath142 . then one can use another expression that relates the helicity basis to the basis @xmath143 .",
    "the final result is @xmath144 here @xmath135 in the calculated amplitude is replaced by @xmath145 .",
    "the decay amplitudes in the @xmath23 model were converted to partial wave amplitudes by means of a recoupling calculation .",
    "the whole expression for the amplitudes , including the integrals of eqs .",
    "[ integral ] and [ recoupling ] , was converted into a sum over angular momentum quantum numbers , using the techniques of roberts and silvestre - brac @xcite ( a result very similar to theirs was obtained ) .",
    "these techniques require that the radial portion of the meson wavefunctions be expressible in certain functional forms , which encompass simple harmonic oscillator wavefunctions .",
    "our simple wavefunctions obviously meet these requirements , and since the detailed wavefunctions of ref .",
    "@xcite are expansions in terms of sho wavefunctions , they do too .",
    "these expressions for the amplitudes were then computed symbolically using routines written for mathematica @xcite .",
    "these routines are usable for any meson decay where the radial portion of the wavefunctions can be expanded in terms of sho wavefunctions , and are limited only by the size of the symbolic problem that results , and the available computer resources .    in the flux - tube breaking model",
    "there are two 3-dimensional integrations before converting to partial wave amplitudes .",
    "the wish to be able to write general routines for any meson decay meant that only two of the six integrals could be done analytically ; the remaining four must be done numerically . in order to minimize the numerical integration , the jacob - wick formula , rather than a recoupling calculation , was used to convert to partial wave amplitudes since no further integrals are involved .",
    "an integrand for each partial wave amplitude was prepared symbolically and converted to fortran code using routines written for mathematica , and then integrated numerically using either adaptive monte carlo ( vegas @xcite ) or a combination of adaptive gaussian quadrature routines .",
    "again , these routines are usable for any meson decay where the radial portion of the wavefunctions can be expanded in terms of sho wavefunctions , and are limited only by the size of the problem and available computer resources .",
