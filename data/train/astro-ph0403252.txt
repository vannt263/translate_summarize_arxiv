    "this study combines the results of theoretical and observational studies to the life time of stellar clusters .",
    "it is of vital importance to understand how disruption processes influence a cluster population in order to get better understanding of the observed luminosity and mass distribution .",
    "a key question in studying cluster mass functions is whether the power law mass distribution of young clusters , as observed in interacting / merging and starburst galaxies , will evolve into a log - normal mass distribution as observed for old globular cluster populations .",
    "if so , a preferential depletion of low mass clusters is necessary .",
    "the two most important dynamical processes influencing the cluster mass function are 1 ) evaporation , which is due to internal relaxation of the cluster and 2 ) tidal shocking .",
    "the first is a result of two body interactions within the cluster which drive the low mass stars through interaction with higher mass stars to the edge of the cluster until they reach a velocity greater than the escape velocity and leave the cluster .",
    "tidal shocks can be caused by passing giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) or when the cluster travels through a disk , bulge or spiral arm .",
    "the stars in the cluster gain kinetic energy which causes the cluster to expand and become less gravitationally bound .",
    "the time scales involved for relaxation and shocks depend on the mass and the half - mass radius of the cluster : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "boutloukos & lamers ( 2003 ) ( bl03 ) and zepf et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have proposed that if a general dependence between the disruption time and the mass exists of the form @xmath8 , that there should be a relation between the mass and the radius of the cluster : @xmath5 in order to reduce both time scales to the simple expression @xmath9 .",
    "this shallow relation between radius and mass has been observed for clusters in ngc3256 ( zepf et al .",
    "1999 ) and several spiral galaxies ( larsen , these proceedings )",
    "bl03 propose a scaling law for the disruption time of a star cluster :    @xmath10    with @xmath2 the typical disruption time of a 10@xmath11 cluster and @xmath12 a dimensionless index .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath12 can be derived from the age and mass distributions of a cluster sample .",
    "bl03 did this for different galaxies and found that @xmath13 is varying per galaxy but that @xmath12 is remarkably constant with @xmath14 .",
    "disruption according to eq .",
    "1 is needed to explain the observed mass and age distribution of clusters in m51 ( see also gieles et al . , these proceedings )",
    "baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) have studied disruption of clusters of different mass and in different orbits in an external tidal field by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "a clear power - law relation between the disruption time and the initial mass is found .",
    "the mean predicted slope , corresponding to the @xmath12 value , is @xmath15 which agrees very well with the empirical value .",
    "the scaling value @xmath2 found in these simulations depends strongly on the distance to the galactic center and ranges between 2 gyr and 10 gyr for clusters in a spherical symmetric potential .",
    "this is much larger then the values found by bl03 ( @xmath161 gyr for the solar neighborhood ) .",
    "this can be explained by the different definitions of the empirical disruption time and the calculated life time and by the fact that the simulations did not include a disk , spiral arms and gmcs which all decrease the life time of the cluster in the disk of our galaxy ."
