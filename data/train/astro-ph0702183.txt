    "the lorentz and centrifugal forces play important roles in the star formation process . while gravity and thermal pressure are isotropic forces , the lorentz and centrifugal forces are anisotropic forces and are closely related to disk formation , outflow , and jets in collapsing clouds .",

    ", it is seen that the rotation and magnetic field in a cloud gradually increase as the cloud collapses .",
    "however , the magnetic field strength and angular velocity of observed protostars indicate that neither the magnetic flux nor angular momentum is conserved in collapsing clouds . in general , these anomalies are called the ` magnetic flux problem ' and ` angular momentum problem . '",
    "the former problem refers to the fact that the magnetic flux of a molecular cloud is much larger than that of a protostar with equivalent mass .",
    "the latter problem is that the specific angular momentum of a molecular cloud is much larger than that of a protostar .",
    "these problems imply that there must be mechanisms removing magnetic flux and angular momentum from a cloud core . in a collapsing cloud ,",
    "these two problems are mutually related .",
    "namely , the angular momentum is removed by magnetic effects ( i.e. , magnetic braking , outflow , and jets ) , while the magnetic field is amplified by the shearing motion caused by cloud rotation .",
    "hence , the magnetic field and rotation can not be treated independently in considering the magnetic flux and angular momentum problems .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to treat the evolution of the magnetic field and rotation analytically since the density ( @xmath12 ) and scale ( @xmath13au ) of molecular clouds are very different from those of protostars ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , numerical simulation is needed to study the magnetic field and rotation of protostars formed from molecular clouds .",
    "angular momentum is removed from a collapsing cloud by magnetic braking and outflow , as shown by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that about 70% of the total angular momentum is removed from the collapsing cloud core in the isothermal phase ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath1099% of the total angular momentum is transferred by outflow in the adiabatic phase ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , previous studies show that angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic effects .",
    "in contrast , there are relatively few studies of the evolution and removal process of magnetic flux in collapsing cloud cores , especially for high density ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite analytically investigated the dissipation process of the magnetic field in a collapsing cloud core and showed that it is expected that the magnetic flux is removed from the cloud core largely for @xmath19 .    to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field and rotation ( or the magnetic flux and angular momentum problems ) ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the cloud evolution of a cloud from the molecular cloud core ( @xmath20 ) to protostar formation ( @xmath21 ) while accounting for the magnetic field and rotation .",
    "the evolution of a magnetized cloud up to a central density of @xmath22 has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite calculated cloud evolution up till the formation of a protostar ( @xmath23 ) , and showed that the magnetic field plays important roles in the star - formation process .",
    "however , they adopted an ideal mhd approximation , which is valid in low - density gas regions ( @xmath24 ) , but is not valid in high - density gas regions ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a significant magnetic flux loss occurs for @xmath25 by ohmic dissipation @xcite and hence these studies overestimate the magnetic flux in a collapsing cloud , especially in high - density gas regions .",
    "following @xcite , we report detailed results of three - dimensional non - ideal mhd nested grid simulations . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the cloud evolution from the cloud core ( @xmath26 , @xmath27au ) to protostar formation ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and discuss the magnetic field and angular momentum of the formed protostar .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the frameworks of our models are given in  2 and the numerical method of our computations is shown in  3 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  4 .",
    "we discuss the magnetic field and angular momentum of a protostar and compare our results with observations in  5 .",
    "to study the cloud evolution , we use the three - dimensional resistive mhd nested grid code .",
    "we solve the resistive mhd equations , including self - gravity : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denote the density , velocity , pressure , magnetic flux density , resistivity , and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "the last term in equation ( 3 ) denotes the ohmic dissipation .",
    "although the dissipation term is expressed exactly by @xmath37 , we simplify it as shown in the equation ( 3 ) .",
    "this simplification allows us to reduce computational costs considerably , and we can follow the collapse of the cloud up to the stages of the stellar core formation .",
    "the deviation due to this simplification is examined by test calculations of typical models ; this simplification does not affect evolution of the cloud considerably , and the magnetic field strength deviates by a factor of two at most at the central region .    to mimic the temperature evolution calculated by @xcite",

    "the specific angular momentum at the end of the calculation is slightly smaller than that at the initial state , caused by angular momentum transfer by the non - axisymmetric pattern . in this model ,",
    "after a thin disk is formed , the disk is transformed into a bar , because bar mode instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is caused by rapid rotation .",
    "the specific angular momentum begins to decrease around the center of the cloud as the non - axisymmetric pattern grows .",
    "fragmentation in this unmagnetized model is observed for further calculations , as also shown by @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", fragmentation plays an important role in the angular momentum evolution , because the angular momentum is redistributed into the orbital and spin angular momentum of each fragment .",
    "we will discuss the fragmentation and redistribution of the angular momentum in subsequent papers .",
    "the specific angular momenta of magnetized clouds at the end of the calculation are plotted by the solid ( non - ideal mhd model 29 ) and thin broken lines ( ideal mhd model 30 ) in figure  [ fig:11]_c_. the specific angular momenta of both models 29 and 30 at the end of the calculation are smaller than those at the initial state . in these models ,",
    "the specific angular momentum decreases by vertical collapse , magnetic braking , outflow , and jets .",
    "when the initial cloud is magnetized strongly ( or rotates rapidly ) , the cloud collapses vertically along the magnetic field line ( i.e. , vertical collapse ) .",
    "gas with small specific angular momentum preferentially falls into the central region , and thus the central region gains specific angular momentum in the vertical collapse regime .",
    "note that vertical collapse does not transfer angular momentum , because this mechanism changes only the location of each fluid element and thus the gas keeps its specific angular momentum . for higher densities ( @xmath157 ) ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted , and outflow and jets appear .",
    "the angular momentum is effectively transferred by the outflow and jets , as already shown by @xcite .",
    "magnetic braking is also important for the angular momentum transfer . in principle , however , a reduction of the angular momentum due to magnetic braking can not be distinguished from that due to outflow and jets , because outflow and jets are consequences of the magnetic braking process .",
    "figure  [ fig:11]_d _ shows the evolution of the specific angular momentum @xmath329 in the inner region for models 29 , 30 , and 33 as a function of the central density .",
    "the angular momentum is integrated within @xmath330 at each timestep and averaged as @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the mass within @xmath333 . in this graph , the specific angular momenta in the magnetized clouds ( models 29 and 30 ) are smaller than that in the unmagnetized cloud ( model 33 ) for @xmath334 .",
    "the difference of the specific angular momentum for the isothermal phase ( @xmath149 ) is due to magnetic braking and vertical collapse , because no outflow appears in this phase .",
    "the specific angular momentum in model 30 ( ideal mhd model ) is smaller than that in model 29 ( non - ideal mhd model ) for @xmath255 , because magnetic braking is less effective due to magnetic dissipation for @xmath309 .    at the protostar formation epoch ( @xmath139 ) , protostars have specific angular momenta of @xmath335 for model 31 , @xmath336 for model 29 , and @xmath337 for model 30 .",
    "observations indicate that classical t tauri stars have specific angular momenta of the order of @xmath338 @xcite . at the end of our calculation ,",
    "the formed protostars have masses of only @xmath136 .",
    "since the spatial distribution of the specific angular momentum follows @xmath339 for rigid rotation , the region inside @xmath340 of t tauri stars has an average specific angular momentum of @xmath10@xmath341 .",
    "thus , the specific angular momenta in non - ideal mhd models such as model 29 are about one order of magnitude larger than those of observed protostars . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the angular momentum evolution only in the early star formation phase ( @xmath342 ) . in the later accretion phase , however , the angular momentum is transferred by star ",
    "disk interaction , stellar wind , and jets . to fully solve the angular momentum problem ,",
    "the evolution in the later phase must also be calculated .",
    "this paper focuses on the formation of single stars , and hence we have investigated the evolution of slowly rotating clouds . as shown in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "fragmentation occurs in a collapsing cloud core and binary or multiple stars are formed in initially rapidly rotating clouds . when binary or multiple stars are formed , the angular momentum is redistributed in the orbital and spin angular momenta of each star @xcite .",
    "thus , the binary or multiple star formation process is also important for the angular momentum problem .",
    "we will investigate the evolution in initially rapidly rotating clouds in subsequent papers .      in our calculation",
    ", the formed protostars have magnetic fields of @xmath343 ( model 16 ) to @xmath344 ( model 32 ) in models with @xmath345 ( non - ideal mhd models 16 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , and 28 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a surface magnetic field of the order of 13@xmath131 has been derived from zeeman broadening measurements of ctts photospheric lines @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetic fields derived from our calculation are consistent with observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotation periods of protostars in our calculation are slightly shorter than the observations .",
    "the formed protostars have rotation periods of @xmath346 days ( model 26 ) to 1.53 days ( model 32 ) in models with @xmath94 , while observed protostars have rotation periods of @xmath34710 days @xcite .    since our calculations show only the early star formation phase , in which the protostars have masses of @xmath348@xmath349 .",
    "the magnetic field strength and angular momentum of a protostar may change in subsequent gas accretion phase .",
    "the magnetic field may be amplified by magneto - rotational instability @xcite and by shearing motion between the star and the ambient medium .",
    "the angular momentum of a protostar may increase due to accretion of gas with large angular momentum , and decrease by jets or star  disk interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to fully describe the magnetic field and angular momentum of protostars",
    ", we must calculate the cloud evolution up to the later accretion phase .",
    "however , our results indicate that at its formation epoch , a protostar already has a magnetic field strength and rotation period almost of the same order of magnitude as observations .",
    "thus , the magnetic field and angular momentum of observed protostars may be largely determined by the early star formation phase before the main accretion phase .",
