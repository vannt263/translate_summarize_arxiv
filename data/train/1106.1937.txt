    "much of the underlying physics of a core collapse supernova remains unexplored , the mechanism leading to the explosion not well understood . though it is clear that neutrinos play a major role in the dynamics of the explosion , carrying away 99% of the energy emitted by the dying star .",
    "the observation of neutrinos in the provenance of sn 1987a in several experiments @xcite has confirmed the crucial role they play in the overall picture .",
    "the limited number of detected neutrinos , however , has not provided enough statistics to constrain current supernova models .",
    "this may only be achieved with a detector performing routine sn detection , about one per year .",
    "the idea of using icecube as a supernova detector was first discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the sudden increase in the photomultiplier count rate on a timescale of the order of @xmath3seconds : qualitatively , the release by a supernova at @xmath4kpc with a total amount of energy of @xmath5mev in neutrinos of about @xmath6mev corresponds to a flux of @xmath7 in its completed configuration and with its data acquisition system , icecube has about @xmath8mton effective detection volume and a reach of about @xmath9kpc at @xmath10 c.l .",
    "detection level . here",
    ", we extend that method and assess the potential of icecube and several prospective detector configurations by considering multiple hit detection in a single or neighboring sensors from individual neutrino interactions .",
    "we demonstrate that multi - hit modes enable the extraction of new observables related to the features of the neutrino emission spectrum and the supernova location , not accessible by means of the original method . this new data stream could help study questions related to supernova dynamics ( neutronization burst , accretion and cooling phase , see @xcite and references therein ) or fundamental questions of particle physics , related to the nature of the neutrino @xcite .",
    "the observation of electron neutrinos from the early neutronization burst could disentangle the neutrino hierarchy @xcite , provided a sufficiently large mixing angle @xmath11 as indicated recently @xcite .",
    "these new detection modes are conceptually situated between a full reconstruction of the events and the current search method balancing the simplicity of the latter with the richness in information of the former .",
    "we show that the loss of information in the current method is not necessary and that a very elementary reconstruction , implemented through the coincident hit methodology , can enhance the information obtained during a supernova explosion .",
    "in fact , it would appear natural to extend the new detection modes to a full reconstruction of supernova events in the case of a very densely instrumented volume .    according to  @xcite ,",
    "the estimated sn rate from our galaxy is about @xmath12 .",
    "it increases to @xmath13 within @xmath14mpc and about @xmath15 within @xmath16mpc .",
    "we will see that extending the reach of a future detector to such a large distance is quite challenging given the quick decrease of the interaction density with distance .",
    "superk , with its @xmath17kton fiducial volume , remains at the moment an instrument of choice @xcite .",
    "icecube @xcite with its 86 strings and this new detection methodology could become a serious competitor , even surpass it , provided a deep and denser core extension installation .",
    "there are several good reasons for such an extension beyond an enhanced potential for sn detection , mainly the detection of individual high energy neutrinos down to several gev related to multiple physics aspects , such as neutrino sources in the southern sky @xcite , indirect detection of dark matter down to lower mass @xcite and neutrino particle physics @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the potential of other projected @xmath18kton - class detectors , e.g.  liquid scintillator lena  @xcite or liquid argon detectors  @xcite , which will have an extended potential for sn detection but comparatively small fiducial volumes at energies beyond gev .",
    "especially the latter are complementary to water or ice - based cherenkov detectors , since they are more sensitive to the electron neutrino channel , providing a better access to the physics during the neutronization burst @xcite . combining the measurements from these detectors , which differ not only in their sensitive material , but in their geographic location , would enable the study of matter effects and neutrino hierarchy by observing neutrinos from the same supernova from different viewpoints with a high detection probability .",
    "finally , a large detector will not only increase the distance reach for sn but also provide large event statistics for galactic sn with possible resolution for their location , leading through a sn alert system ( snews  @xcite ) to the optical detection of obscured and otherwise missed galactic sne .    in section 2 , we define the studied configuration and the benchmark supernova neutrino flux .",
    "we present the effective volume analytical calculations in section 3 and their consequences in section 4 .",

    "for one , in water or ice , which are natural media for high energy neutrino telescopes , the ( anti-)electron neutrino interaction with oxygen has a much higher energy threshold and a quite significantly smaller cc cross section at the energies of interest @xcite .",
    "this largely makes this channel subdominant for the interaction rate in the detector compared to the ibd reaction yield .",
    "moreover , a large fraction of the neutrino energy is absorbed into binding energy , reducing the cherenkov light yield and dramatically suppressing the potential of this reaction channel given that our methodology relies on the coincident detection of cherenkov photons in neighboring sensors .",

    "although the average neutrino energies , @xmath116mev and @xmath117mev , are larger resulting in smaller flux than in the sf model , the interaction density is increased by more than 50% due the ibd cross section increase turning into a considerable increase in the coincidental hit rate ( by a factor @xmath118 ) as will be seen .",
    "we assess the discovery and learning potential by requesting the signal over square root of noise ratio @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the c.l . in @xmath121 unit , respectively , using the poissonian distribution @xmath122 : given a mean number of expected coincidental noise events @xmath123 , a minimum number of @xmath124 events is required to reach significance @xmath125 , @xmath126 the distance reach is therefore given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the distance in 10 kpc units and @xmath129 is the number of signal events from a sn explosion at 10 kpc .",
    "an advantage of the detection method relying on coincidental hits arises from a more gaussian distributed coincidental noise rate ( while the single hit noise rate distribution has non gaussian tails , requesting coincidences dilutes them ) . the false alarm rate ( assuming gaussianity ) for @xmath119 is roughly @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath120 is a requirement too weak and not adequate for icecube to trigger as a standalone detector , but where icecube may help establishing stronger constraints by enhancing the quality of an observation : it sets the distance scale for icecube to contribute in supplementing information to observations made by other instruments detecting e.g. a neutrino or an optical signal . in the latter case , of course",

    "the positron effective detection volume as a function of the neutrino energy is the product of the number of target protons in the interaction volume and of the fraction of uniformly distributed positrons leading to a detection .",
    "it is an important and well defined concept for our analysis because the positron tracks are nearly point - like with a path length of about 10 cm in average , a small distance compared to the mean distance between a positron and a sensor in which it leaves a signature .",

    "with the effective volumes estimated above , we now have all the ingredients to calculate the number of single and coincidental hit detections . in table  [ table - sf ] , we provide the number of detections and the distance reach for unit signal over background information and for a 5@xmath121 c.l",

    "a careful assessment and quantification of the resolution by studying the impact of the incoming direction on the induced distortion on the hit time difference distribution and the various coincidental hit ratios requires monte carlo studies .",
    "such a study should also take into account the elastic scattering channel .",
    "although we pointed out above that the low cross section of this channel will limit its contribution to the overall detection potential , the strong angular correlation and forward peaked cross section might result in a slight enhancement for the measurement of the incidence direction .",
    "in order to confirm the simple analytical calculations for single hit effective detection volume and to precisely study the new coincident hit detection methodology and the new observables to which it grants access , precise simulation should be performed . in particular , a precise assessment of the angular resolution in locating the sn from the asymmetric cherenkov emission can be reliably studied as a function of distance and which is only qualitatively stated in this paper .",
    "with such a tool , a dedicated work not focused only on ibd but implementing other neutrino interactions , e.g.  with oxygen , would permit the precise assessment of the potential of the novel analysis method for oscillations and matter effect , hierarchy and deleptonization neutrino emission phase studies .",
    "a significant increase in potential would be reached with the imagined ddc@xmath24 icecube extension , with sensors combining several improvements such as a larger and uniform collection surface and an increased photo - detection efficiency ( which is of specific interest as the distance reach scales linearly at first order with the q.e .  for @xmath191 and @xmath192 detection modes ) .",
    "sn detection up to @xmath204mpc would be at hand with the foreseen potential boost of this detector .",
    "such an extension , considerably cost effective compared to similar projects , would be motivated by a broader experimental interest , vastly enhancing the detection potential of low energy neutrinos , @xmath205gev , connected to physics of neutrino oscillations , dark matter neutrino signatures , astrophysical neutrinos in particular from the southern hemisphere , etc  @xcite .    to reach about @xmath204mton effective detection volume , thus granting access to sn at distance scales larger of about @xmath16mpc and guarantee routine sn detection",
    ", the ddc@xmath24 configuration is likely too modest and the number of modules should rather be about 10000 . also r&d and extensive simulations will be necessary in order to determine the optimal module arrangement , the sensor technology ( e.g.  the use of solid state detectors instead of pmt , see  @xcite for a review ) , and other hardware related parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning an interesting outcome of this analysis : the method described here can be readily applied to existing and future icecube data in the regular muon data acquisition mode : events of @xmath206s duration are recorded at a rate of about @xmath118 khz , _",
    "i.e. _ representing a lifetime fraction of about 5% , without the necessity of a dedicated data stream .",
    "numbers provided in this paper can readily be rescaled to obtain the reach in the baseline icecube configuration and its deepcore provided a corresponding rescaling of the distance reach ( by a factor of about 4 ) . concerning a dedicated data stream",
    ", we do not discuss here the possible hardware implications for the realistic implementations of the methodology , but it may well already be implementable within the current icecube data acquisition hardware .",
    "the methodology is natural for operating  @xcite and projected  @xcite water detectors , given a comparatively large noise rate ( based on  @xcite , we found in  @xcite a discussion based on a similar approach ) .",
    "we finally note that accounting for spin - flavor conversion and msw effect for neutrinos propagating outward the sn core @xcite , the @xmath207 flux is shifted to slightly higher average energy , improving the prospects of the coincidental hit method .",
