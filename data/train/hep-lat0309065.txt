    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) provide a means of parametrizing hadronic contributions to both exclusive and inclusive processes .",
    "they reduce in certain limits to form factors and to ( forward ) parton distributions . for a review on the nucleon axial structure see @xcite and for spin - dependent parton distributions consult @xcite .",
    "gpds depend on three independent kinematic variables and are therefore far more difficult to extract from experiments than forward parton distributions .",
    "lattice simulations provide a general , model - independent way to compute their moments directly .",
    "first results for spin - independent gpds have been presented in @xcite .",
    "these papers , however , concentrate on rather large quark masses .",
    "it is imperative to extend these studies down into the chiral regime .    in this talk , we will present a first study of spin - dependent gpds , both with wilson fermions at large quark masses and with staggered sea and domain - wall valence fermions at intermediate quark masses .",
    "spin - dependent gpds are specified by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , defined via @xmath3 the upper index f denotes the quark flavor , @xmath4 is the average longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck quark , and @xmath5 the longitudinal momentum transfer .",
    "the total invariant momentum transfer squared is given by @xmath6 , with the four - momentum transfer @xmath7 .",
    "the average hadron momentum is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "we also use the short - hand notation @xmath9 .    by taking moments with respect to @xmath4",
    ", we end up with a tower of local matrix elements of the form @xmath10    * 3c|c +   + num & & @xmath11 + @xmath12 & & @xmath13 + @xmath14 & & @xmath15 + @xmath16 & & @xmath17 +   +   + num & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath11 + @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 +   + @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 +    these matrix elements can then be computed by a lattice simulation .",
    "the parametrization of these matrix elements follows from their lorentz - structure in the continuum and is expressed in terms of the generalized form factors ( gffs ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for example , for @xmath27 : @xmath28 the moments of @xmath29 and @xmath2 are polynomials in @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 as coefficients , @xmath33 the reconstruction of the gpds is therefore possible by an inverse mellin transform .",
    "we use five samples of unquenched gauge field data in our simulations .",
    "the parameters of the lattices are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : latt - pars ] . as valence quarks we use wilson fermions on the sesam lattices and domain wall fermions with a height of @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the milc lattices . in the latter case we also use hyp - smearing @xcite with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "with @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the form factors have been normalized to one at @xmath41 and fitted by a dipole form . ]",
    "the domain - wall masses have been adjusted to keep the pseudoscalar lattice mass in the region of the lowest corresponding staggered one . for the wilson fermion",
    "renormalization constants we use the perturbative one - loop results quoted in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization constants for the domain - wall case are not yet calculated , so we use the tree - level value .",
    "hence , our results are preliminary .    .",
    "]    . ]",
    "we concentrate on the quark flavor combination u - d since the resulting matrix elements are free from disconnected contributions .",
    "the gff @xmath42 corresponds to the axial form factor , while @xmath43 is the first gff which is not directly accessible experimentally .",
    "both gffs are plotted with normalization @xmath44 for the heaviest quark mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : atilde - n ] .",
    "the curves provide dipole fits to the data points with the error bands representing one standard error .",
    "it is apparent that the dependencies on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath45 of @xmath46 do not factorize , a result that is very similar to the spin - independent case @xcite .",
    "however , the difference between the two moments appears to be smaller in the spin - dependent case .    the axial coupling as a function of the quark mass is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : axialcoup ] .",
    "one should note , however , that this quantity is highly sensitive to finite - volume effects @xcite . at least at the lightest mass ,",
    "a couple of simulations at larger lattice volumes need to be performed to achieve a conclusive result for the chiral behavior .",
    "the first moment of the forward parton distribution @xmath47 is displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : atilde - forw ] .",
    "although the measured values decrease in the chiral regime toward the experimental value , this result needs to be corroborated with better statistics .",
    "in this talk we have presented first results on spin - dependent generalized parton distributions . in the forward case",
    "we have presented preliminary results for light quark masses which eventually should allow us to bridge the gap to the chiral regime .",
