    "it is known that the standard model does not fix the number of fermion families .",
    "this number should be less than 9 in order to preserve asymptotic freedom and more than 2 in order to provide cp violation .",
    "according to the lep data on z decays , number of chiral families with light neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) is equal to 3 , whereas extra families with heavy neutrinos are not forbidden .",
    "the fourth chiral family was widely discussed thirty years ago ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , the topic was pushed off the agenda due to the misinterpretation of the lep data .",
    "twenty years later 3 workshops on the fourth sm family @xcite were held ( for summary of the first and third workshops see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "main motivation was flavor democracy @xcite which naturally provides heavy fourth family fermions including neutrino ( consequences of flavor democracy hypothesis for different models , including mssm and @xmath2 , have been considered in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , fourth family gives opportunity to explain baryon asymmetry of universe , it can accommodate emerging possible hints of new physics in rare decays of heavy mesons etc ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "phenomenological papers on direct production ( including anomalous resonant production ) of the sm4 fermions at different colliders are reviewed in @xcite ( see tables vi and vii in @xcite ) .",
    "this activity has almost ended due to misinterpretation of the lhc data on the higgs decays .",
    "it should be emphasized that these data exclude the minimal sm4 with one higgs doublet , whereas non - minimal sm4 with extended higgs sector are still allowed @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", partial wave unitarity puts an upper limit around 700 gev on the masses of fourth sm family quarks @xcite , which is almost excluded by the recent atlas and cms data on search for pair production .",
    "for example , atlas @xmath3 tev data with 20.3 @xmath4 integrated luminosity excludes new chiral quarks with mass below 690 gev at 95% confidence level assuming br(@xmath5)=1 @xcite .    even if sm4 may be excluded by the lhc soon , this is not the case for the general chiral fourth family ( c4f ) .",
    "therefore , atlas and cms should continue a search for c4f up to kinematical limits .",
    "concerning pair production , rescaling of the atlas lower bound using collider reach framework @xcite shows that lhc with @xmath6 tev will give opportunity to cover @xmath7 up to 0.94 , 1.25 , 1.50 , and 2.13 tev with integrated luminosities 20 , 100 , 300 and 3000 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this study is motivated by a recent paper @xcite , which shows that in order to interprete 125 gev scalar boson as dilaton the mass of the fourth family quarks should exceed 2 - 2.5 tev ; therefore fourth family quarks can not be observed at the lhc via pair production .",
    "for this reason , we consider possible resonant production of c4f quarks through their anomalous interactions with light quarks . in section",
    "ii standard and anomalous decays of the c4f quarks are considered .",
    "resonant production of fourth chiral family quarks is analyzed in section iii .",
    "finally , conclusions and recommendations are given in section iv .",

    ", we implement lagrangian ( [ eq:1 ] ) into calchep package @xcite .",
