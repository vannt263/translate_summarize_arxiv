    "the existence of high - energy extraterrestrial neutrinos is suggested by the observation of high - energy cosmic rays and gamma rays .",
    "observation of neutrinos could shed light on the production and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic - rays , which for energies above the `` knee '' ( @xmath2 ) remain not understood .",
    "cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated at the shock fronts of galactic objects like supernova remnants , micro - quasars , and in extragalactic sources such as the cores and jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "high energy protons accelerated in these objects may collide with the gas and radiation surrounding the acceleration region , or with matter or radiation between the source and the earth .",
    "charged pions , produced in the interaction , decay into highly energetic muon neutrinos and muons which further decay into electron neutrinos .",
    "fermi acceleration of charged particles in magnetic shocks naturally leads to power - law spectra , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is typically close to 2 .",
    "hence , the spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos is harder than the spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) potentially allowing to distinguish the origin of the flux ( see for example @xcite ) .    for a generic astrophysical neutrino source ,",
    "one expects a ratio of neutrino fluxes @xmath6 . due to",
    "neutrino vacuum oscillations this ratio changes to @xmath7 by the time the neutrinos reach the earth .",
    "recently a search with the amanda detector was reported @xcite , resulting in the most restrictive upper limit on the diffuse flux of muon neutrinos ( in the energy range 6 to 1000 tev ) .",
    "clearly , a high sensitivity to neutrinos of all neutrino flavors is desirable .",
    "the present paper reports on a search for a diffuse flux of neutrinos of all flavors performed using neutrino - induced cascades in amanda .",
    "amanda - ii @xcite is a cherenkov detector consisting of 677 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) arranged on 19 strings .",
    "it is frozen into the antarctic polar ice cap at a depth ranging mainly from 1500   to 2000  m. amanda detects high - energy neutrinos by observation of the cherenkov light from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "the detector was triggered when the number of pmts with signal ( hits ) reaches 24 within a time - window of 2.5  @xmath8s .",
    "the standard signatures are neutrino - induced muons from charged current ( cc ) @xmath9 interactions .",
    "the long range of high energy muons , which leads to large detectable signal event rates and good angular resolution results in restrictive bounds on neutrino point - sources @xcite .",
    "other signatures are hadronic and/or electro - magnetic cascades generated by cc interaction of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "additional cascade events from all neutrino flavors are obtained from neutral current interactions .",
    "good energy resolution , combined with low background from atmospheric neutrinos makes the study of cascades a feasible method to search for extraterrestrial high energy neutrinos .",
    "before the completion of amanda - ii , the detector was operated in a smaller configuration .",
    "the results for the search of neutrino induced cascades in 130.1 effective days of the 10-string amanda - b10 detector during 1997 have been reported before @xcite .",
    "the same analysis has been applied to 221.1 effective days of experimental data collected during 1999 .",
    "the amanda detector in 1999 had three more strings than in 1997 , yet data from these strings were not used in this analysis , so that the detector configuration used in the 1999 neutrino induced cascade search is very similar to that of 1997 .",
    "signal simulation for the analysis of 1999 data was improved to the standards reported in this letter .",
    "no events were found in the 1999 experimental data after all selection criteria had been applied .",
    "we will present results supposing a background of zero events .    using the procedure explained in this letter",
    "we obtain an upper limit on the number of signal events of @xmath12=2.75 at a 90% confidence level , from which we calculate the limit on the flux of all neutrino flavors . assuming a flux @xmath0 consisting of an equal mix of all flavors , one obtains an upper limit @xmath13 . in the calculation of this limit",
    "we included a systematic uncertainty on the signal detection efficiency of @xmath1432% .",
    "about 90% of the simulated signal events for this limit have energies between 5 and 300 tev , while 5% have lower and 5% have higher energy . differences between this result and the one obtained with 1997 experimental data @xcite are due to the larger live - time in 1999 and improved simulation .",
    "the data set of the first year of amanda - ii operation comprises @xmath15 triggered events collected over 238 days between february and november , 2000 , with 197 days live - time after correcting for detector dead - time .",
    "the background of atmospheric muons was simulated with the air - shower simulation program corsika  ( v5.7 )  @xcite using the average winter air density at the south pole and the qgsjet hadronic interaction model @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray composition was taken from @xcite .",
    "all muons were propagated through the ice using the muon propagation program mmc ( v1.0.5 )  @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the detector response includes the propagation of cherenkov photons through the ice as well as the response of the pmts and the surface electronics .    besides generating unbiased background events , the simulation chain was optimized to the higher energy threshold of this analysis . by demanding that atmospheric muons passing through the detector radiate a secondary with an energy of more than 3  tev ,",
    "the simulation speed is increased significantly .",
    "a sample equivalent to 920 days of atmospheric muon data was generated with the optimized simulation chain .",
    "the simulation of @xmath16 and @xmath11 events was done using the signal generation program anis ( v1.0 )  @xcite .",
    "the simulation includes cc and neutral current ( nc)interactions as well as @xmath17 production in the @xmath18 channel near 6.3  pev ( glashow resonance ) .",
    "all relevant neutrino propagation effects inside the earth , such as neutrino absorption or @xmath11 regeneration are included in the simulation .    the data were reconstructed with methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the time information of all hits , a likelihood fit results in a vertex resolution for cascade - like events of about 5  m in",
    "the transverse coordinates ( x , y ) and slightly better in the depth coordinate ( z ) .",
    "the reconstructed vertex position combined with a model for the energy dependent hit - pattern of cascades allows the reconstruction of the energy of the cascade using a likelihood method .",
    "the obtained energy resolution in @xmath19 lies between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the performance of the reconstruction methods have been verified using _ in situ _ light sources .    .",
    "cumulative fraction of triggered events passing the cuts of this analysis .",
    "values are given for experimental data , atmospheric muon background monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , atmospheric @xmath10 simulation and a @xmath10 signal simulation with an energy spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "the flavor @xmath10 was chosen to illustrate the filter efficiencies , since interactions of @xmath10 always lead to cascade - like events . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since no excess events have been observed above the expected backgrounds , upper limits on the flux of astrophysical neutrinos are calculated .",
    "the uncertainties in both background expectation and signal efficiency , as discussed above , are included in the calculation of the upper limits .",
    "we assume a mean background of 0.96 with a gaussian distributed relative error of 73% , and an error on the signal detection efficiency of 25% . for a 90% confidence level an upper limit on the number of signal events , @xmath20 ,",

    "table [ tab : model_limits ] summarizes the predicted event numbers for different models of hypothetical neutrino sources .",
    "thereby , the spectral forms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are assumed to be the same ( the validity of this approximation is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , full mixing of neutrino flavors is assumed , hence @xmath26 as well as a ratio @xmath27 .",
    "electron neutrinos contribute about 50% to the total event rate , tau neutrinos about 30% and muon neutrinos about 20% .",

    "no experimental event has been observed in that energy range , which results in an upper limit on the number of signal events of @xmath43 assuming @xmath1425  % uncertainties in the signal expectation and negligible background expectation .",
    "the limit on the flux at 6.3 pev is : @xmath44    the transformation of this limit to a limit on a total neutrino flux is not completely straightforward , since the fraction of @xmath45 produced in the source is unknown . in cases of neutrino production through @xmath30 collisions",
    "one expects a ratio @xmath46 .",
    "hence , one would expect that about 1/6 of all neutrinos are @xmath41 .",
    "however , the @xmath41 produced in the @xmath47 interaction through decay of the neutron carries only a very small fraction of the energy , and hence for most neutrino spectra contributes negligible to the high energy flux of neutrinos . for this case , a flux of @xmath41 results mainly from neutrino oscillations . for maximal neutrino",

    "results from the first phase of amanda , the 10-string sub - detector amanda - b10 , have been reported in @xcite and an update to the analysis was presented above .",
    "compared to amanda - b10 , the analysis presented here has a nearly ten times larger sensitivity , mainly achieved through using the larger volume of amanda - ii and by extending the search to neutrinos from all neutrino directions .",
    "the limits presented here are also more than a factor of two below the amanda - b10 limit obtained by searching for neutrino - induced muons @xcite and roughly as sensitive as the extension of that search using amanda - ii 2000 data @xcite .",
    "( assuming a neutrino flavor ratio of 1:1:1 , the numerical limits on the flux of neutrinos of a specific flavor ( e.q .",
    "@xmath9 ) reported in the literature are 1/3 of the limits on the total flux of neutrinos . )",
    "the limits obtained from a search for cascade - like events by the baikal collaboration @xcite are about 50% less restrictive than the limits presented here .    with the present analysis one obtains a large sensitivity to astrophysical neutrinos of all flavors and in particular to electron and tau neutrinos .",
