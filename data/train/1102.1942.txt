    "recursion operators @xmath4 play an important role in the theory of the nonlinear evolution equations ( nlee ) , integrable by the inverse scattering method .",
    "they have been constructed and analyzed for a wide class of lax operators @xmath5 and appeared to generate not only the lax representations , but also the hierarchy of nlee s related to a given lax operator @xmath5 , their conservation laws and their hierarchy of hamiltonian structures , see @xcite and the numerous references therein . such operators can be viewed also as the lax @xmath5 operator , taken in the adjoint representation of the relevant lie algebra @xmath6 .",
    "the construction of @xmath4 for lax operators , whose explicit dependence on the spectral parameter @xmath7 is comparatively simple ( say , linear , or quadratic ) has been done a long time ago @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the completeness property for the set of eigenfunctions of @xmath4 ( the ` squared solutions ' of @xmath5 ) is of paramount importance .",
    "the completeness of the ` squared solutions ' plays a fundamental role in proving that the ism is , in fact , a nonlinear analogue of the fourier transform , which allows one to linearize the nlee . using these relations",
    "one is able to derive all fundamental properties of the nlee on a common basis .",
    "an important tool of extracting new nlee from a known multi - component ones , is the the reduction group , introduced in @xcite .",
    "it led to the discovery of the 2-dimensional toda field theories @xcite .",
    "latest developments of the method led to the discovery of new automorphic lie algebras and their classification @xcite .",
    "the problem of deriving recursion operators becomes more difficult when we impose additional reductions on @xmath5 .",
    "if this additional reduction is compatible with @xmath5 , being linear or quadratic in @xmath7 , the construction of @xmath8 is not a difficult task , see @xcite .",
    "an alternative construction of @xmath8 as formal recursion operator is given in @xcite , see also the review papers @xcite .",
    "the effect of the @xmath9-reduction is as follows : i ) the relevant ` squared solutions ' have analyticity properties in sectors of the complex @xmath7-plane closing angles @xmath10 ; ii ) the grading of the lie algebra @xmath11 is more involved and as a consequence the recursion operator is factorized into a product of @xmath12 factors @xmath13 , and each of the factors @xmath14 maps @xmath15 .    the situation becomes more complicated if the additional reduction drastically changes the @xmath7-dependence of the lax operator .",
    "here we address this problem for one of the simplest nontrivial cases when the lax operator @xmath5 , due to an additional @xmath16-reduction changes its @xmath7-dependence from polynomial into rational one .",
    "the linear in @xmath7 lax operator @xmath17 was shown to give rise @xcite to the integrable system @xmath18 where @xmath19 is @xmath20 complex matrix and @xmath21 is the unit matrix .",

    "the corresponding recursion operators , relevant for the fundamental properties of eq .",

    "this reduction is among the simplest nontrivial ones , see @xcite .",
    "due to it , the relevant lax operator acquires a rational dependence of @xmath7 : @xmath27 and the simplest nlee take the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 subject to the condition : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : uv0 }    @xmath30 sweeps a @xmath34-dimensional sphere in @xmath35 .",
