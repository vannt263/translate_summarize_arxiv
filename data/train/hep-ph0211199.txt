    "the first published calculation of the phase of neutrino oscillations , on the assumption that neutrinos are massive , but ultra - relativistic , was made in 1969 by gribov and pontecorvo  @xcite .",
    "no details of the method used to obtain the phase were given .",
    "later publications used this result for phenomenology . in 1976",
    "a paper was published  @xcite in which an oscillation phase a factor of two smaller than the gribov - pontecorvo result was obtained .",
    "no comment was made , then or later , on this discrepancy , which remained unnoticed before a paper written recently by the present author  @xcite in which more bibliographic details of this ` missing controversy ' can be found . since the first derivation of the ` standard ' oscillation phase , as the result of reference  @xcite",
    "will be referred to in this paper , of the order of a hundred papers have been published devoted to the quantum mechanics ( qm ) of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the present paper has three aims .",
    "the first is to carefully review the kinematical and geometrical assumptions of previous calculations , particularly with regard to their consistency in terms of an expansion in powers of the neutrino masses .",
    "the second is to present a calculation of the oscillation phase , for sources at rest , using a covariant feynman path amplitude formulation  @xcite of qm the third is to critically discuss treatments , in the literature , of the qm of neutrino oscillations , in the light of both the kinematical and geometrical findings of the present paper and the physical insights provided by the path amplitude treatment .",
    "the calculations presented here are only a sub - set of those to be found in a previous paper by the present author  @xcite , results of which are also summarised in a short letter  @xcite .",
    "the calculations in reference  @xcite include neutrino oscillations following decay at rest pions , muons and @xmath0-unstable nuclei , muon oscillations following pion decay at rest , and neutrino and muon oscillations following decay in flight of ultra - relativistic pions .",
    "also discussed in reference  @xcite are different mechanisms ( both coherent and incoherent ) that may contribute to damping of the oscillations .",
    "an attempt has been made , in the present paper , to give a more pedagogical presentation in which the crucial underlying physical assumptions used are spelt out as clearly as possible .",
    "reference  @xcite contains already a extensive critical review of the previous literature . in the present paper ,",
    "the further discussion has been largely motivated and orientated by the reports of several anonymous reviewers of references  @xcite . since writing these papers i became aware of the important work of shrock  @xcite who pointed out , more than twenty years ago , the incoherent nature of the weak decay processes in which neutrino mass eigenstates are produced .",
    "this was indeed one of the crucial assumptions for the calculations presented in references  @xcite .",
    "i also now fully understand the ( simple ) reason why the standard oscillation phase has been obtained in essentially all published derivations since reference  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as will be demonstrated , the wrong ( standard ) instead of the correct ( gribov - pontecorvo ) neutrino propagation phase has been universally obtained due to the universal failure to use the correct description of the weak neutrino production processes as formulated by shrock  @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "only two - flavour mixing will be considered , so that the mixing amplitudes : @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 refers to neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath3 and @xmath4 refers to the flavour of the charged lepton participating in the weak interaction process ) may be taken to be real .",
    "unitarity then enables all mixing amplitudes to be described in terms of a single angular parameter , @xmath5 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "._values of the flavour - mass mixing amplitude @xmath6 _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that there are no ` neutrino flavour eigenstates ' .",
    "the amplitude @xmath7 , for example , is the amplitude to produce the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath8 in association with ( or in the decay of ) a muon .",
    "thus the flavour - mass mixing amplitudes fix the strength of the charged current couplings to the neutrino mass eigenstates  @xcite . for example , in the decays : @xmath9 the leptonic charged current is : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) to be compared with the quark currents : @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 is an element of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns )  @xcite lepton flavour / mass mixing matrix , and @xmath15 is an element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm )  @xcite flavour / mass mixing matrix in the quark sector .",
    "the couplings of antineutrinos to charged anti - leptons are the same as those of neutrinos to charged leptons in the two flavour mixing case .    the amplitude to produce a charged lepton of flavour @xmath0 by the interaction of a neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath16 produced in a decay involving a charged lepton , form a charged current that couples to a real or virtual w boson . ] of flavour @xmath17",
    "may , in general , be written as : @xmath18 the probability to observe a charged lepton of flavour @xmath0 , in the case that the neutrino mass eigenstates are not distinguished , is then , by superposition : @xmath19     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ` neutrino oscillation phase ' @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 the gribov - pomeranchuk value of the oscillation phase is : @xmath22 whereas the standard result is : @xmath23 in eqns(1.4 ) and ( 1.5 ) , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the neutrino masses , @xmath27 is the source - detector distance and and @xmath28 is the measured neutrino momentum .",
    "units with @xmath29 are used throughout this paper .",
    "the word ` neutrino ' , without further qualification , stands for ` neutrino mass eigenstate ' .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sections 2 , 3 and 4 various kinematical and geometrical approximations that have been used in neutrino oscillation calculations are discussed . in particular it will be examined whether particular approximations retain , or not , all the leading order o(@xmath30 ) terms , or contribute only negligible o(@xmath31 ) corrections .",
    "the lorentz invariant nature of the oscillation phase is fully exploited in these purely mathematical considerations .",
    "section 5 describes the calculation of the oscillation phase using the covariant feynman path amplitude method .",
    "section 6 is devoted to a discussion of previous treatments of the qm of neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , the physical basis of widely used gaussian wave packet models is questioned .",
    "section 7 contains a brief summary and outlook .",
    "in this case , the one - dimensional propagation amplitude for a particle of mass @xmath32 over space and time intervals : @xmath33 and @xmath34 is given by : @xmath35\\right\\ }      \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   p_0 \\exp\\left\\{-im_i \\delta \\tau_i\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\equiv &   p_0 \\exp\\left\\{-i\\delta \\phi_i\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is the proper time interval , in the rest frame of the particle , @xmath16 , corresponding to space and time intervals @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the laboratory frame , so that : @xmath37 the relativistic relation between energy , momentum and mass : @xmath38 implies a group velocity @xmath39 for the travelling wave represented by eqn(2.1 ) given by : @xmath40 in the following , it is assumed that the neutrino mass eigenstates whose propagation is described by eqn(2.1 ) , have velocity @xmath41 .",
    "as correctly emphasised in reference  @xcite particle oscillation experiments actually measure the spatial , not the temporal , dependence of quantum mechanical interference effects .",
    "therefore , throughout the kinematical discussions in the present and following sections , a fixed distance , @xmath42 , is assumed between the source particle ( at rest ) and the detection event . with the additional assumption that the propagating neutrino mass eigenstates are on - shell particles ,",
    "several different exact expressions may be written for the lorentz - invariant phase increment : @xmath43 where , in the last member of eqn(2.5 ) , the relation : @xmath44 has been used , and @xmath45 is the usual parameter of special relativity .",
    "the value of the oscillation phase : @xmath46 obtained using different kinematical approximations will now be considered . for this",
    "it is useful to introduce the quantity @xmath47 which is the limiting value of @xmath48 or @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "the following expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 may then be written : @xmath51\\right\\}+ o(m^4 )    \\\\",
    "e_i & = & p_0\\left\\{1 + \\left(\\frac{m_i}{m_s}\\right)^2\\left[\\frac{1 }   { 1-r_m^2}\\right]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the mass of the decaying source particle and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of the particle ( or system of particles ) recoiling against the neutrino in the decay process .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the average kinematical quantities for the neutrino mass eigenstates : @xmath56 if , as is usually done in the literature , common values of both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are assumed for both mass eigenstates , then : @xmath59 and @xmath60 it must be remarked at once that such an ` equal velocity ' hypothesis is in contradiction with the fundamental definitions in eqns(2.1)-(2.4 ) . for logical consistency , if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are assumed to be equal for the two mass eigenstates , then also @xmath49 and @xmath48 in eqn(2.1 ) should be replaced by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , evidently , no neutrino oscillations would be possible .",
    "in fact the equal velocity hypothesis assumes not only eqn(2.12 ) but also that the energy and momentum appearing in the 4-vector product in ( 2.1 ) are in accordance with energy momentum conservation in the decay process . since @xmath63",
    ", there is then an internal contradiction .",
    "also , because of eqn(2.12 ) , the corresponding space and time intervals do not respect the equations : @xmath64 , i.e. the neutrinos do not move along classical trajectories specified by the group velocities @xmath65 .",
    "thus the equal velocity hypothesis respects energy - momentum conservation , but not the constraints of space - time geometry , and contains an internal contradiction .",
    "the formula ( 2.1 ) combines the quantities ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) from space - time geometry and ( @xmath49 , @xmath48 ) from particle kinematics .",
    "the equal velocity hypothesis then treats , in an inconsistent manner , these two sets of quantities . introducing the notation @xmath66 for the approximate phase increment calculated with fixed velocity @xmath67 , according to eqns(2.9)-(2.13 ) , then : @xmath68 now denoting by the superscripts @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 the values of @xmath73 calculated using the successive members of eqn(2.14 ) the following results are obtained : @xmath74 the phases @xmath75 and @xmath76 are found to be equal and a factor of two larger than either @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "the different results obtained indicate that some inconsistent approximations must have been made in the passage from the exact expressions for the phase increment in ( 2.5 ) to the approximate ones in ( 2.14 ) . to see just where the inconsistency has occured , and which results , @xmath69 and @xmath70 or @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are correct",
    ", the calculation is now done using the exact formulae of eqn(2.5 ) and , for ease of comparison with the approximate expressions in eqn(2.14 ) the neutrino masses are written as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 thus @xmath81 are correction terms , relating the approximate relations in eqns(2.14 ) to the exact ones in eqn(2.5 ) . denoting by @xmath82 the interference phase calculated using eqn(2.5 ) then : @xmath83 thus the result obtained is in agreement , at o(@xmath30 ) , with the approximate calculations in cases iii and iv .",
    "using now eqns(2.19 ) and ( 2.20 ) : @xmath84l    = \\left[\\frac{(\\overline{m}+\\delta_1)^2-   ( \\overline{m}+\\delta_2)^2}{\\overline{p}}\\right]l    + o(m^4 ) \\nonumber   \\\\      & = & \\frac{(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)}{2\\overline{p}}l +   \\frac{(m_1-m_2)\\overline{m}}{\\overline{p}}l+ o(m^4 )        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing the second term on the rhs this equation with eqns(2.15 ) or ( 2.16 ) it can be seen that the correction terms in eqn(2.19 ) have the effect of doubling the approximate results @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus important o(@xmath30 ) contributions are neglected in eqns(2.15 ) and ( 2.16 ) .",
    "the reason why the constant velocity approximation is so poor in eqns(2.15 ) and ( 2.16 ) becomes evident on inspection of eqn(2.13 ) .",
    "unlike in the case of neutral kaons or b - mesons , the neutrino masses may be widely different , so that although , for highly relativistic neutrinos , the velocities of the mass eigenstates may be very similar , this is not the case for the lorentz-@xmath87 factors in eqn(2.13 ) that are inversely proportional to the neutrino masses .",
    "the important difference between the exact and approximate calculations occurs in the very first member of eqn(2.15 ) . indeed , as is shown by eqns(2.21 ) and ( 2.15 )",
    ": @xmath88 in fact , in eqns(2.17 ) and ( 2.18 ) , the approximate lorentz-@xmath87 factor @xmath89 is replaced by the still approximate but mass dependent @xmath87-factors @xmath90 which differ from the exact ones @xmath91 by corrections of only o(@xmath30 ) .",
    "thus , up to corrections of o(@xmath31 ) , the same result is obtained as the exact formula . on the other hand the difference between @xmath92 , used in eqn(2.16 ) , and @xmath93 or @xmath94 used in eqn(2.5 ) , is of o(@xmath95 ) and so can not be neglected in an o(@xmath30 ) calculation of the oscillation phase .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the oscillation phase directly in the laboratory system , using eqn(2.1 ) , rather than by lorentz transformation from the neutrino center of mass to the laboratory system as in eqns(2.5 ) and ( 2.14 ) .",
    "considering first the equal velocity case : @xmath96l     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the relations : @xmath97 and noting that , from eqns(2.6 ) and ( 2.10 ) that @xmath98 , eqn(2.24 ) may be written as : @xmath99 in agreement with eqns(2.15 ) and ( 2.16 ) .",
    "the exact formula gives : @xmath100l   \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\left[\\frac{m_1 ^ 2}{p_1 } -\\frac{m_2 ^ 2}{p_2 } \\right]l   \\nonumber",
    "\\\\    & = &    \\frac{(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)}{\\overline{p}}l + o(m^4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in agreement with eqns(2.17 ) and ( 2.18 ) . it can be seen that : @xmath101 again , the ` equal velocity ' formula is seen to neglect o(@xmath30 ) contributions that double the value of the oscillation phase .",
    "the neglect of important o(@xmath30 ) terms when the equal velocity hypothesis is made especially transparent on rewriting eqn(2.21 ) in the following way : @xmath102 since @xmath103 eqn(2.30 ) can be written as : @xmath104l+o(m^4)\\ ] ] the equal velocity hypothesis now implies :    * neglect of @xmath105 i.e. of the second term in the square brackets in eqn(2.32 ) . * making the replacement : @xmath106 in the remaining term of eqn(2.32 ) .",
    "it is now obvious that ( a ) and ( b ) neglect ( different ) o(@xmath30 ) terms ; a term @xmath107 for ( a ) and a term @xmath108 for ( b ) .",
    "the sum of these neglected terms is @xmath109 , equal to the terms retained by the equal velocity hypothesis .",
    "thus the essentially universally employed ` equal velocity ' assumption results in the neglect of o(@xmath30 ) terms in the calculation of the vacuum oscillation phase .",
    "the existence of these terms explains the factor of two difference between the original calculation of the oscillation phase by gribov and pontecorvo ( which is the correct o(@xmath30 ) result ) and the ` standard phase ' given by all calculations that make the ` equal velocity ' assumption .",
    "the calculation of the oscillation phase is now repeated assuming , instead of equal velocities for the neutrino mass eigenstates , either equal momenta or equal energies .",
    "for equal momenta the following relations hold : @xmath110 these yield , for the invariant phase increment : @xmath111 comparing with eqn(2.5 ) it can be seen that each member of the two equations differ only by terms of o(@xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , at o(@xmath30 ) the gribov - pontecorvo result ( 2.21 ) is obtained for the oscillation phase . for the equal energy case : @xmath112 @xmath113 again , all terms in last equation differ from the corresponding ones in the exact expression ( 2.5 ) only by terms of o(@xmath31 ) so that the oscillation phase agrees with the value in eqn(2.21 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that this result is also obtained in the case of either equal momenta or equal energies if the oscillation phase is calculated directly in the laboratory system as in eqn(2.28 ) .",
    "it may be shown , in a similar way , that once a constant value of @xmath58 is assumed , the standard oscillation phase is obtained independently of whether the energy and momentum are calculated on the assumption of exact energy - momentum conservation , or whether the equal momentum and different energy or different momentum and equal energy hypotheses are used .",
    "thus , the ` standard ' oscillation phase is obtained only in the case of the ` equal velocity ' hypothesis . in all cases :",
    "` equal velocity ' , ` equal momentum ' and ` equal energy ' an unphysical assumption is being made ( i.e. one that violates conservation of energy and momentum ) .",
    "the study just presented shows that in the latter two cases the error of the approximation is only of o(@xmath31 ) in the oscillation phase , and so is negligible at o(@xmath30 ) .",
    "however , in the former case , the neglected terms are of o(@xmath30 ) and so lead to an incorrect result at this order .    finally , in this section it will be found of interest for the subsequent discussion of independent temporal or spatial propagation to calculate the separate temporal ( @xmath114 ) and spatial ( @xmath115 ) parts , in the laboratory system , of the lorentz - invariant oscillation phase @xmath20 : @xmath116     \\frac{(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)}{p_0}l + o(m^4 )    \\\\",
    "\\phi_{12}^{lab}(s ) & = & -(p_1-p_2)l = \\frac{(1+r_m^2)}{4 p_0 }   ( m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)l   + o(m^4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on adding ( 2.43 ) to ( 2.44 ) it can be seen that the lorentz invariant oscillation phase originates entirely from the temporal part , the spatial part being exactly cancelled by a term in the temporal one .",
    "very often in the literature , following reference  @xcite , the plane wave propagator of eqn(2.1 ) has been modified by the introduction of a multiplicative gaussian spatial wave packet : @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is given in eqn(2.1 ) and : @xmath120\\ ] ] in this formulation the intervals @xmath57 and @xmath58 are assumed to be the same for all mass eigenstates , so that the equal velocity hypothesis is tacitly introduced . to calculate the oscillation phase , @xmath121 an integration over the transit time in the range @xmath122",
    "is performed , leading to the result  @xcite : @xmath123l\\ ] ] where @xmath124 it may be noted that the effective average velocity @xmath125 is _ lower _ than that of either mass eigenstate .",
    "this is presumably due to the contribution of the unphysical , for fixed source detector distance @xmath126 , assumed in this calculation , is at variance with the known space - time structure of the decay and detection events , i.e. an exponential distribution of decay times followed by a mass dependent propagation time @xmath34 . ]",
    "negative region in the integration over @xmath58 . using the relation : @xmath127 eqn(3.3 ) may be written : @xmath128\\left[1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_1 ^ 2}{p_1 ^ 2 } + \\frac{m_2 ^ 2}{p_2 ^ 2}\\right)\\right]-(p_1-p_2)\\right\\ } + o(m^4 ) \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_1 ^ 2}{p_1 } - \\frac{m_2 ^ 2}{p_2}\\right)+\\frac{(p_1-p_2)}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_1 ^ 2}{p_1 ^ 2 } + \\frac{m_2 ^ 2}{p_2 ^ 2}\\right)\\right]l + o(m^4 ) \\nonumber   \\\\   & = & \\frac{(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)}{2\\overline{p}}l   + o(m^4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eqn(2.6 ) has been used to write @xmath48 in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath32 .",
    "the ` wave - packeted ' propagator thus gives the same oscillation phase at o(@xmath30 ) as the unmodified invariant plane wave propagator when the same equal velocity hypothesis is made .",
    "in both cases important o(@xmath30 ) terms are neglected in comparison with the exact calculation .    in a more elaborate recent calculation",
    "@xcite where wave packets are associated not only with the neutrinos , but also with all particles participating in the production and decay processes , a formula for the phase increment identical to ( 3.1 ) was obtained except that the width of the spatial wavepacket @xmath129 is replaced by a parameter @xmath130 that depends on the widths of the wavepackets of all participating particles . since the oscillation phase ( 3.3 ) does not depend on this parameter the same ` standard ' result is obtained as in reference  @xcite .",
    "the result obtained with different mean velocities , @xmath67 given by eqns(2.9)-(2.12 ) and @xmath125 given by eqn(3.4 ) are the same .",
    "indeed , it is clear from the derivation of ( 3.6 ) from ( 3.3 ) that a mean velocity @xmath131 defined by any formula of the type : @xmath132 where @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath87 are arbitary coefficients of order unity , will yield the result ( 3.6 ) . however , in the derivation of the same formula in eqns(2.15 ) , ( 2.16 ) this result requires that @xmath133 . if instead the value @xmath134 , suggested by eqn(3.4 ) , is used , then a different result is obtained : @xmath135 thus , unlike in the case of the invariant plane wave , the wave - packet treatment gives inconsistent results for the oscillation phase in the neutrino centre - of - mass and laboratory systems .",
    "many descriptions of neutrino oscillations ( especially concise presentations in review articles concerned mainly with the description of experimental results , or theoretical models of neutrino masses ) do not use a lorentz invariant description but consider instead independent temporal ( te ) or spatial ( se ) evolution of the wavefunctions of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "it is in this way that the standard formula for the oscillation phase of eqn(1.5 ) was first derived in reference  @xcite .",
    "a simple schrdinger time evolution is used giving the temporal propagator : @xmath136\\ ] ] or @xmath137 to relate the time interval @xmath58 ( assumed to be the same for both neutrino mass eigenstates ) to the experimentally measured source - detector separation @xmath27 , it is further assumed that the neutrinos are ultra - relativistic and so move at the speed of light , i.e. @xmath126 . to derive the oscillation phase the eigenstates",
    "are then assumed to have equal momentum , @xmath28 , but different energies . as first pointed out in reference  @xcite",
    "this assumption is in contradiction with energy - momentum conservation in the decay process .",
    "this is easily seen by inspection of eqns(2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) above .",
    "indeed , the violation of energy - momentum conservation is an o(@xmath30 ) effect .",
    "still , making this assumption : @xmath138 so that eqn(4.2 ) gives : @xmath139 this calculation is wrong , firstly because it does not respect lorentz invariance and secondly because the kinematical approximations made ( neutrinos of equal momenta moving at the speed of light ) neglect important o(@xmath30 ) terms , as can be seen by comparing the exact expression of the temporal part @xmath140 in the laboratory system of the lorentz invariant oscillation phase in eqn(2.43 ) with eqn(4.4 ) .",
    "returning now to the question of the compatibility of eqn(4.1 ) with special relativity , such a formula is a reasonably good approximation to the exact , lorentz - invariant , result in the non - relativistic ( nr ) limit where @xmath141 . in this case : @xmath142 so that , up to a fractional correction @xmath143 , the non - relativistic result is the same as the exact one ( 2.5 ) , and the same result , eqn(2.21 ) , is obtained for @xmath20 .",
    "the different value obtained in eqn(4.4 ) evidently is a consequence of the ` equal time ' assumption @xmath144 , which results in the neglect of important o(@xmath30 ) terms .",
    "it should be stressed that the use of eqns(4.4 ) or ( 4.5 ) to describe ultra - relativistic neutrinos is wrong in just the same way that the use of the non - relativistic formula for the total energy of a particle , @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , is wrong when @xmath147 .",
    "other authors  @xcite motivated by the correct observation that flavour oscillation experiments actually measure quantum interference effects as a function of space , not time , have proposed to describe neutrino oscillations in terms of only a spatial evolution of the wavefunction : @xmath148\\ ] ] or @xmath149 now , making the additional assumption ( incompatible with energy - momentum conservation in the decay process ) of equal energies , @xmath150 , so that : @xmath151 eqn(4.7 ) gives : @xmath152 in agreement with eqn(4.4 ) .",
    "as in the case of independent time evolution , eqn(4.7 ) is wrong , firstly , because it does not repect lorentz invariance , and secondly kinematical assumptions are made ( equal energies and different momenta ) leading to a result differing by o(@xmath30 ) terms from the spatial part of the exact invariant result , as can be seen by comparing eqns(4.9 ) and ( 2.44 ) .",
    "unlike for the case of time evolution , there is no kinematical domain in which an equation similar to eqn(4.7 ) is a good approximation .",
    "it is tantamount to performing a kinematical calculation with 4-vectors , the temporal components of which have all been arbitarily set to zero . in all cases",
    "it yields a very bad approximation .",
    "actually , to derive eqn(4.6 )  @xcite the lorentz invariant plane wave was written down and equal velocities , i.e. @xmath153 , as well as equal energies were assumed for both mass eigenstates so that the temporal contributions cancel exactly in the interference phase .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming the purely spatial propagation of eqn(4.6 ) .",
    "the physical arguments given in references  @xcite to justify the equal energy hypothesis are further critically examined in section 6 below .",
    "it should be noted that both the te and se hypotheses contain a further internal contradiction , different from that of the equal velocity hypothesis discussed in sections 3 and 4 above . in the latter , the correct values of @xmath49 and @xmath48 , as given by energy - momentum conservation , are assigned in the plane wave propagator , only the geometrically inconsistent values @xmath154 are assumed . for the te and se hypotheses , not only are the values of @xmath34 inconsistent with the relation @xmath155 , but energy - momentum conservation is also violated by the ` equal momentum ' or ` equal energy ' hypotheses .",
    "the latter assumptions , however , only generate shifts of o(@xmath31 ) in the oscillation phase as compared to the result obtained assuming exact energy - momentum conservation .",
    "in this section , a general discussion of the underlying principles of flavour oscillation calculations in the feynman path amplitude formulation of qm is first given before deriving the oscillation phase for a simple two - flavour problem with the source particle at rest .",
    "more refined calculations performed in a similar manner may be found in reference  @xcite .    after the pioneering conceptual work of planck , einstein and bohr , qm was formulated in several independent ways ; most importantly , this was done by heisenberg , schrdinger and feynman .",
    "the heisenberg ( matrix mechanics ) and schrdinger ( wave mechanics ) formulations originally competed for the description of atomic physics .",
    "however , the greater similarity with classical physics , the less abstract nature and superior calculational power of the wave mechanics approach resulted in this soon being adopted as the standard one , both in atomic physics research and in text books on non - relativistic qm .",
    "wave mechanics is particularly well adapted to subjects such as atomic , molecular and nuclear physics , where the solution of bound state problems plays an important role ; a domain that may be called ` quantum statics ' . in the present writer",
    "s opinion it is , however , less well suited to ` quantum dynamics ' where predictions concerning measurements of events at different space - time points are required .",
    "flavour oscillation experiments are of just this latter type . the formulation of qm most naturally adapted to such problems is the feynman path integral .",
    "the story of this approach is really that of the re - introduction of space - time into microscopic physics after the quantum revolution of the early 20th century .",
    "bohr declared in his ` copenhagen interpretation ' talk at lake como  @xcite that space and time were outmoded classical categories in the quantum world .",
    "the first important step in the direction of the rehabilitation of space - time was dirac s seminal paper on the lagrangian in qm  @xcite , that was the basis feynman s formulation of the principles of qm specifically in terms of probability amplitudes corresponding to particles moving in space - time  @xcite .",
    "the essence of this approach is contained in a single formula , the importance of which , for a fundamental understanding of qm , had already been stressed by heisenberg in 1929  @xcite : @xmath156 this equation gives the probability of transitions between a group @xmath157 of initial states and a group @xmath158 of final states . the use of this formula to describe a quantum experiment requires knowledge of both the initial ( prepared ) and final ( measured ) states .",
    "indeed , the corresponding quantum experiment is defined by the experimenter s choice of these states . only when they are specified is a meaningful comparison of theory with experiment possible . since typical experimental conditions do not permit to either prepare or measure a single quantum state the ( incoherent ) sums over @xmath159 and @xmath95 in ( 5.1 ) are necessary .",
    "these sums are defined by purely experimental criteria ( detector sizes or resolution ) and are unrelated to microscopic , quantum level , parameters .",
    "the states @xmath160 ( of which , in the detailed description of any actual space - time quantum experiment , there are , actually , a multiple infinity ) represent _ unobserved _ intermediate states . in the case of particle trajectories in space - time , described by space - time coordinates , @xmath161 , of interest for the present discussion , the phase to be assigned to any given path amplitude , say , @xmath162 is given by the corresponding classical action divided by @xmath163 .",
    "that is , the integral of the classical lagrangian ( divided by @xmath163 ) along the classical particle trajectory corresponding to the sequence of space - time points @xmath164 , @xmath165, ... @xmath166 where @xmath167",
    ". an important feature of eqn(5.1 ) is that interference occurs only between amplitudes corresponding to _ different unobserved intermediate states _ never between different initial and final states .    for the flavour oscillation problem ,",
    "the general path integral formula ( 5.1 ) may be simplified considerably .",
    "the initial and final states correspond to the space - time positions   of the source particle and the detection event . as the particles propagate over macroscopic distances , in free space , they follow classical ( straight line ) trajectories .",
    "the corresponding feynman path integral then reduces to a green function , or propagator , that is the fourier transform of the well - known momentum space propagator of a free particle in quantum field theory . the explicit , general , expression for the invariant space - time propagator of a fermion",
    "was given in one of feynman s early papers on qed  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been rederived directly , from the covariant path integral , for an arbitary massive particle , by mohanty  @xcite .",
    "apart from solid angle correction factors , that are not relevant to the conventional 1-dimensional discussion of flavour oscillations , the propagator for on - shell particles , or for virtual particles over macroscopic time - like invariant intervals such that @xmath168 ( where @xmath169 is the pole mass of the particle ) is given , for a stable particle .",
    "] , up to constant factors , by the simple expression : @xmath170 .",
    "this means that it is mathematically identical to the ` lorentz invariant plane wave ' of eqn(2.1 ) .",
    "however , its physical meaning : a green function that gives the amplitude for a particle to be found at a given space - time point , when , at some prior time , the particle was situated at another , well defined , spatial position , is quite different to that of the ` plane waves ' ( energy momentum eigenstates ) of conventional schrdinger - born wave mechanics .",
    "the latter , interpreted as wavefunctions according to the born prescription , are not square integrable , and so are devoid of any information concerning the position of the particle . in the case of flavour oscillation experiments , on the other hand , the experimental knowledge that can be obtained concerning the position of the propagating particles , once they are created by the decay process , is essentially classical , i.e. , unaffected by uncertainties of a purely quantum mechanical nature .",
    "the meaning of this remark will be clarified by a concrete example to be given below .",
    "in fact ` quantum uncertainty ' as manifested in the heisenberg uncertainty relations results only in the uncertainty in the time at which the propagating particle is produced by the unstable source particle .",
    "the associated spread in the physical mass of the source particle , and of any unstable recoil particles , then produces , via energy - momentum conservation in the decay process , momentum or velocity smearing of the neutrino mass eigenstates .    to take a specific example ,",
    "consider the decay of a pion at rest : @xmath171 . as",
    "the pion is unstable , it has , in general , a physical mass @xmath172 that is different from the most likely physical mass , the pole mass , @xmath173 .",
    "similarly , the physical mass @xmath174 is different from the pole mass @xmath175 .",
    "the breit - wigner widths , @xmath176 , of the physical mass distributions are related to the particle mean lifetimes , @xmath177 , by the energy - time uncertainty relation @xmath178 .",
    "since the initial state of the path amplitudes , that of the source pion , is the same in all path amplitudes , the kinematical effects of the non - equality of @xmath172 and @xmath173 will be the same for all path amplitudes , i.e. the resultant velocity smearing of the neutrinos is incoherent .",
    "on the other hand , since the recoil muon is unobserved , its physical mass may be different in the paths corresponding to different mass eigenstates .",
    "the corresponding breit - wigner amplitudes will then create a coherent velocity ( or momentum ) wave packet for each eigenstate .",
    "this is a simple application of eqn(5.1 ) .",
    "the spatial trajectory , for fixed momentum , @xmath179 , yielding the path amplitude : @xmath180 is replaced by the sum of path amplitudes ( path integral ) : @xmath181 as shown in reference  @xcite , the effect of such wave - packets on the oscillation phenomenon is minute , in particular for the case of pion decay , as well as for neutrino oscillation experiments in general . as discussed below , it may , however , become more important for quark flavour oscillations where the spread in the physical masses of the propagating particles is of the same order as their mass difference .",
    "all the relevant constraints imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty relations have been taken into account in the above discussion .",
    "in particular , as will be considered in more detail in the following section , there is no ` spatial wave packet ' associated with the neutrinos , and the possibility , ( or not ) of interference between the path amplitudes does not depend upon the existence ( or not ) of such a hypothetical spatial wave packet .",
    "the momentum wave packet referred to above is not related , by a fourier transform , to any spatial wave packet with simple physical properties .",
    "the muon is an unstable particle with an exponential decay law and mean lifetime @xmath182 .",
    "the fourier transform of this exponential yields , in energy space , a breit - wigner amplitude with width parameter @xmath183 that describes the distribution of the physical mass , @xmath174 , of the muon . using energy - momentum conservation ,",
    "the corresponding spread in @xmath174 generates a spread in the momentum and energy of the neutrino .",
    "this spread , weighted by the breit - wigner amplitude , generates the momentum wave packet referred to previously .",
    "taking the fourier transform of the breit - wigner amplitude will give back the original exponential decay law , not a spatial wavepacket .",
    "the irrelevance of the momentum - space uncertainty relation to the problem under discussion is demonstrated by applying it to the neutrino momentum wave packet in pion decay just discussed .",
    "with @xmath184  @xcite the corresponding spatial uncertainty is @xmath185 km .",
    "does this give a limit on the possible knowledge of the spatial position of the neutrino ?",
    "by measuring the time of decay of the pion through detection of the decay muon , with the easily obtained precision of @xmath186 sec , the subsequent position of the neutrino is known with an uncertainty of @xmath187 cm , since the speed of light is precisely known .",
    "the known uncertainty in the position of the neutrino is then a factor @xmath188 smaller than @xmath189 as calculated from the uncertainty relation .",
    "the latter evidently has no relevance to the actual or possible knowledge of the spatial position of the neutrino . except for the spread in decay times of the parent pion ( described by the energy - time uncertainty relation ) there is then no ` quantum uncertainty ' on the position of the neutrino",
    ". once created , its position can be known with classical precision .",
    "the final state in eqn(5.1 ) , in its application to flavour oscillations , is the spatial wavefunction of the detection event . at the microscopic level , this can be considered as localised to within an uncertainty given by the spatial wavefunction of the target particle , which is of atomic dimensions ( say @xmath190 cm ) .",
    "this , however , does not reflect the experimental knowledge of the position of the detection event , that is limited , by considerations of experimental resolution , to the group of states @xmath191 in eqn(5.1 ) . in a typical experiment",
    ", the experimental resolution might be of the order of a centimetre , seven or eight orders of magnitude larger than the microscopic localisation of the target particle .",
    "thus , to a very good approximation , the states @xmath192 can be assumed to be spatial eigenstates .",
    "the correction for the actual distribution of detection events is then included by performing a suitable average over the oscillation probability , as the contribution of different final states is incoherent , requiring classical addition of probabilities .",
    "an exactly similar argument applies to the initial states @xmath193 corresponding to the spatial position of the source particle at some well defined time .",
    "these states also can be assumed , for calculational convenience , to be spatial eigenstates .",
    "it is important to stress that this _ does not imply _ that the momentum uncertainty of the source particle is infinite ( inconsistent with the assumption that it is rest ) .",
    "this is a gross misinterpretation of the meaning of the momentum - space uncertainty relation .",
    "consider the case that the source particle is bound in an atom . the actual quantum positional uncertainty , at the time chosen to define the initial state ,",
    "could be included by writing its spatial wavefunction explicitly in the path amplitude .",
    "however this distance is so much smaller than the experimenter s actual knowledge of the position of the source , which is all that matters to accurately evaluate @xmath194 , that it is evident that the same result will be obtained if , for simplicity , a spatial eigenstate is assumed for the source particle . in an analagous way",
    ", energy - momentum eigenstates are conventionally assumed for all initial and final state particles in the momentum space calculatation of invariant amplitudes in quantum field theory .",
    "this in no way affects the correctness of the results obtained . a naive application of the momentum - space uncertainty relation , as done above for the path amplitude calculation , to this case would imply an infinite uncertainty on the space - time position of the scattering event or decaying particle .",
    "actually the space - time parts of the wavefunctions of the incoming and outgoing particles play no role in a momentum space calculation except for imposing the constraints of exact energy and momentum conservation .",
    "if this is assumed _ ab initio _ the space - time parts of the wavefunctions can be omitted completely without changing the results of the calculations .",
    "of course , in any actual experiment , the source particle is not at rest .",
    "if it is negatively charged and forms an atomic bound state it will have some fermi motion . if it is positively charged , and remains unbound , it will be subject to random thermal motion .",
    "corrections for these effects can be included in the calculation of the oscillation frequency by a suitable averaging procedure .",
    "since they affect only the definition of the group @xmath69 of initial states , these corrections are incoherent , and , just as in the case of the positions of the source particle and detection event , the averaging must be done at the level of probabilities , not amplitudes .",
    "in fact averaging the source momentum distribution at the amplitude , rather than probability , level will result in the generation of a spurious ` momentum wavepacket ' with parameters characteristic of the initial momentum _ wavefunction_.",
    "as discussed in the following section , just such a mistake has been made in many papers on the qm of neutrino oscillations in the literature .    before defining the intermediate states",
    "@xmath195 in eqn(5.1 ) for the case of lepton flavour oscillations , it is important to consider the nature of the decay process in which the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath196 and @xmath197 are produced , as already mentioned in section 1 . in the standard electroweak model ,",
    "these states are created by diagrams containing real or virtual w bosons . in the case",
    "that neutrinos are massive , and the different eigenstates have different masses , there is a non - diagonal , unitary , flavour / mass mixing matrix , the mns  @xcite matrix , that is strictly analgous to the better - known ckm  @xcite quark flavour / mass mixing matrix .",
    "the existence of such a non - diagonal matrix implies that lepton ( or generation ) number is not conserved in transitions in the lepton sector just as generation number is not conserved in the quark sector because of the non - diagonal nature of the ckm matrix .",
    "for example , the decays : @xmath198 where @xmath199 denotes a virtual w@xmath200 boson , are strictly analagous to the quark sector processes , where an on - shell w@xmath200 boson decays into quarks : @xmath201 in which the first ( second ) transitions in eqn(5.5 ) are cabibbo allowed ( suppressed ) .",
    "the neutrino mass / flavour mixing angle @xmath5 in table 1 plays the same role in ( 5.4 ) as the cabibbo angle @xmath202 in ( 5.5 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath203 in ( 5.4 ) and the c quark in ( 5.5 ) are both second generation particles , whereas the decay antiquarks are either first or second generation .",
    "this suggests that the neutrino mass eigenstates should also be associated , as are the quark mass eigenstates , to different generations . just as the w decays in ( 5.5 ) are _ independent physical processes _ , so also are the pion decays in ( 5.4 ) .",
    "this has the important consequence , for the following discussion , that @xmath196 and @xmath197 may be produced at _ different times _ in the corresponding path amplitudes .",
    "as will be seen , this leads to an important new contribution to the oscillation phase .",
    "the incoherent nature , as in ( 5.4 ) above , of decays into different mass eigenstates has been previously pointed out by shrock  @xcite .",
    "what has been assumed until now in all discussions of the qm of neutrino oscillations in the literature is that is that lepton number is conserved in pion decay , so that the unique physical process is @xmath204 .",
    "thus the ` flavour momentum eigenstate ' @xmath205 is assumed to be produced at a fixed time .",
    "it is then rewritten , at this time , in terms of @xmath196 and @xmath197 using the mixing amplitudes given in table 1 .",
    "these mass eigenstates subsequently evolve in time according to the different propagators discussed in sections 2 , 3 and 4 above .",
    "the present writer s opinion is that this procedure is wrong .",
    "if neutrinos of different generations have different masses , lepton number _ can not _",
    "be conserved at charged current weak vertices , just as , in the quark sector , generation number is not conserved at such vertices .",
    "the non - existence of a consistent theoretical description of ` flavour momentum eigenstates ' has been previously stressed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "once the incoherent nature of , for example , the two processes in ( 5.4 ) , is recognised , it will be seen that the conceptual problems that have beset the treatment of the qm of neutrino osillations in the past , as evidenced by the many kinematical and geometrical inconsistencies discussed above , all disappear .",
    "the neutrino oscillation phenomenon occurs even when the constraints of of both exact energy - momentum conservation and space - time geometry are imposed .",
    "the latter is simply the condition that the source particle is defined and the detection event observed , each at a unique space time point , and that both the source particle and the neutrinos follow classical space - time trajectories that , together , link these two points .    the detailed application of eqn(5.1 ) to the derivation of the oscillation probability for a simple two - flavour problem , with the source at rest , will now be discussed .",
    "a specific example is given by ` @xmath206 '' is only a shorthand notation to indicate that a muon is involved in the production process and that a electron is observed in the detection event .",

    "@xmath211 or @xmath212 the source particle may decay into the eigenstates @xmath196 or @xmath197 respectively .",
    "these two possiblities are , of course , in classical physics , mutually exclusive . in qm however , as the two different decay modes are indistinguishable , when only the detection event is observed , the corresponding amplitudes , not probabilities , must be added .",

    "historically , as will be seen , the failure to notice ( i ) , leading to the universal assumption that the different neutrino mass eigenstates are produced coherently and at the same time , required the introduction of a spatial wave packet , since otherwise the neutrino mass eigenstates , produced at the same time and propagating with different velocities could not produce the detection event at a well - defined space - time point . only , it was argued , by introducing the spatial ` fuzziness ' associated with the hypothetical spatial wave - packet would interference be possible . in the feynman path description",
    "there is no such spatial ` fuzziness ' .",
    "the detection event can be produced by the interaction of either ( indistinguishable ) neutrino mass eigenstate with the target particle in the detector .",
    "since the space - time trajectories of the neutrinos are essentially classical , with different velocities , this implies different production times for the neutrinos in the alternative interfering amplitudes . in view of ( i ) and the long lifetimes of typical neutrino sources different decay times are allowed .",
    "this is the fundamental reason for the possible occurence of the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "the propagator of the source particle contributes to the path amplitudes associated with each neutrino mass eigenstate , and , as a consequence of the different decay times , gives an important contribution to the interference phase , as demonstrated by the calculations presented in section 5 above .",
    "the important point ( i ) above was pointed out many years ago by shrock @xcite but was never , to the author s best knowledge , applied before the work reported in this paper and references  @xcite to the neutrino oscillation problem .",
    "indeed , the contrary , incorrect , hypothesis of an initial ` lepton flavour eigenstate ' , that is a coherent superposition of different mass eigenstates , has , instead , been universally assumed in the treatment of neutrino oscillations .",
    "a brief historical review of the introduction of the ` wave - packet ' concept into the description of neutrino oscillations will now be made .",
    "the first descriptions of neutrino oscillations were based on plane - wave propagators either ( tacitly ) covariant in the case of gribov and pontecorvo  @xcite , or , temporal only , as in the case , for example , of fritsch and minkowski  @xcite who were the first to derive the standard oscillation phase . the wave - packet concept in the context of neutrino oscillations",
    "was first introduced by nussinov  @xcite , together with the idea of a ` coherence length ' for neutrino oscillations .",
    "nussinov discussed the effect analagous to collision broadening of atomic spectral lines for neutrino sources in the sun .",
    "both the ` wave - packet ' and ` coherence - length ' concepts are related to a classical wave rather than a quantum mechanical description of the associated phenomena .",
    "a source of classical waves of finite duration will evidently produce a wave - train of finite length .",
    "fourier analysis of this spatial wave - train will result in a spread in the momentum of the associated plane - waves described by a coherent momentum wave - packet .",
    "this classical description does not match the sequence of spatio - temporal phenomena underlying the line broadening effect as described by quantum mechanics .",
    "actually , the unstable source produces particles ( photons or neutrinos ) in a process that has a characteristic time much shorter than the mean decay time of the source .",
    "interference effects will occur if some process , intitiated by a decay particle , can correspond to different production times of the latter . in the case of , say , atomic line broadening as observed in the interference - fringe contrast in a michelson interferometer , this time difference results from the different propagation times of the photon in the different arms of the interferometer . in the case of neutrino oscillations , with a source at rest",
    ", it results from different times - of - flight of the different mass eigenstates over the same spatial distance . in both cases",
    "the line broadening effect results from perturbation of the coherent source during the time interval between the two emission times corresponding to the quantum interference condition .",
    "thus the fundamental physical parameter governing the interference damping is the effective lifetime of the coherent source , due either to its spontaneous decay rate or to collision processes .",
    "nussinov correctly identified this parameter , @xmath307 , as the one controlling the damping of the oscillations , but then introduced a hypothetical ` spatial wave packet ' of length @xmath308 .",
    "this is actually a classical wave analogue of the series of spatio - temporal quantum processes just described .",
    "as is well - known from atomic radiative transitions the classical wave and qm calculation both lead to a lorentzian line - shape and so are equivalent if only a description of the momentum distribution of the produced particles is required . of the analagous classical wave packet . ] as shown in the calculations in section 5 , a correct description of interference damping requires the spatio - temporal sequence of quantum events to be properly taken into account .",
    "this is not possible in the classical wave description in which a hypothetical spatial wave packet is introduced .",
    "it must be stressed that in the quantum mechanical description of atomic radiative transitions there is no wave packet associated with photon propagation .",
    "the fourier transform of the exponential decay law of the initial atom produces a lorentzian distribution in the energy of this atom .",
    "when it decays by photon emission , energy conservation then produces a smearing in the energy ( or wavelength ) of the photon that reflects the energy uncertainties of both the initial and final atoms .",
    "but the photon propagates in space - time like a particle with velocity c. there is no associated spatial , or momentum , wave packet . indeed , a photon is a particle and not a classical wave .",
    "krauss and wilczek  @xcite who also estimated the effect of collision broadening on solar neutrino sources , although also mentioning the wave packet description , understood that neutrino oscillations require different emission times in the interfering amplitudes :    ` since these mass eigenstates propagate with different velocities ( for fixed energy ) the desired interference is between neutrinos emitted at _",
    "different times_. '    actually , the mass eigenstates do not have fixed energy ( or momentum ) but certainly have different velocities , so that the above assertion concerning the interference mechanism underlying neutrino oscillations is correct .",
    "the first extended discussion of the qm of neutrino oscillations in terms of wave packets was made by kayser  @xcite . in contradiction with the conclusions of shrock published in the previous year  @xcite",
    "the initial state of the neutrinos was assumed to be a superposition of mass eigenstates with definite lepton flavour , and the propagating neutrinos were assumed to have equal momenta and different energies .",
    "thus energy - momentum conservation is violated in the neutrino production process .",
    "kayser claimed , that in order for the neutrino oscillation phenomenon to be possible , the uncertainty in the momentum of the neutrinos must satisfy the condition : @xmath309 where @xmath310 .",
    "it was then proposed to realise this condition by introducing a hypothetical coherent momentum wave packet with a width consistent with the condition ( 6.1 ) .",
    "this condition was derived from the momentum - space uncertainty relation as follows : it was assumed that the uncertainty , @xmath189 in the position of the neutrino is related to its spread in momentum , @xmath311 , by the relation : @xmath312 . the requirement : @xmath313 , where @xmath314 is the neutrino oscillation length",
    ", then leads to eqn(6.1 ) , it being assumed that if @xmath315 it will be impossible to observe neutrino oscillations .",
    "although this latter condition is evidently correct if @xmath189 refers to the experimental uncertainty in the observed position the neutrino detection event , it is easily shown to be completely false if , instead , it refers to the theoretical uncertainty calculated using the momentum - space uncertainty relation . for example , in the case of pion decay at rest the width of the coherent momentum wave packet associated with the spread in physical mass of the decay muon is @xmath316 mev .",
    "taking @xmath317 , @xmath274 and @xmath318 mev , eqn(6.1 ) gives the limit @xmath319 as compared to the width of the coherent momentum wave packet in pion decay at rest of @xmath320 .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude lower than kayser s lower limit for the possibility of neutrino oscillations , ( 6.1 ) .",
    "yet explicit calculation of the corresponding damping of the interference term  @xcite shows it to be completely negligible .",
    "as discussed in reference  @xcite the momentum spread of the neutrinos due to smearing of the physical mass of the decaying pion , or its thermal motion , are much larger than that associated with the physical mass of the decay muon .",
    "the two former sources are , however , incoherent , and so have no associated wave packets .",
    "in fact , kayser assumes that the mass eigenstates are both produced and detected at the same times i.e. the equal velocity hypothesis is made , in contradiction with the different velocities resulting from the equal momentum and unequal energy hypothesis .",
    "this procedure is justified by the hope that the effect of this logical inconsistency will be annulled by the space - time fuzziness introduced by the hypothetical wave packet :    ` the wave packet treatment eliminates the need to make some idealising assumption by taking both momentum and energy variations properly into account '    the ` idealising assumption ' referred to is actually the exact conservation of energy and momentum that is automatic in all covariant calculations of decay or scattering processes .",
    "the real purpose of the wave packet is , however , rather to enable the neutrinos , incorrectly assumed to be always produced at the same time , but separating spatially due to their different velocities , to be detected at the same time .",
    "this is clearly impossible when , as is in fact the case , they move along essentially classical space - time trajectories .    like nussinov , kayser introduces a hypothetical spatial wave packet of length @xmath321 where @xmath177 is the lifetime of the decaying state .",
    "this wave packet , which , as explained above , is only a classical wave theory analogue of the finite source lifetime , does not exist in the qm calculation .",
    "the fourier transform of the exponential decay amplitude yields a breit - wigner amplitude describing the distribution of the physical mass of the unstable source particle . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "as this mass is a property of the source particle , any resulting momentum smearing of the produced neutrinos is then an incoherent effect .",
    "the only coherent momentum smearing ( yielding a momentum , not a spatial , wave packet ) is that associated with the physical masses of any unobserved , unstable , recoil particles .",
    "kayser then argues that the length of the spatial wave packet must be much shorter than @xmath321 :    ` if we are interested in a neutrino emitted at time @xmath322 , but we can learn only that the emitter was somewhere in a region of length @xmath323 , then the amplitude for the emission to have ocurred at @xmath322 at the various points in this region must be added coherently . thus the neutrino wave packet will have a length @xmath324 . '",
    "the false assumption is made that both neutrinos must be created at the same time , @xmath322 .",
    "it is then assumed , in contradiction with eqn(5.1 ) above , for the case of a neutrino source at rest , that the amplitudes of neutrinos created at different spatial positions must be added coherently .",
    "it corresponds to performing the sums over @xmath95 and @xmath159 in eqn(5.1 ) in a coherent manner , i.e. with @xmath325 inside the modulus squared .",
    "an extended criticism of this assumption may be found in reference  @xcite . in kayser",
    "s interpretation the spatial wave packet is needed to ` delocalise ' the neutrinos , that , because of the assumption of a common production time , become spatially separated due to their different velocities . in fact , the neutrinos can arrive at the detector at the same time because they may be produced at different times in the alternative histories corresponding to the different path amplitudes .",
    "there is then no need for the hypothetical spatial wave packet introduced by kayser .",
    "there are no physical parameters in the qm calculation governing the size of such a wave packet .",
    "it does not exist except in an analagous classical wave theory calculation .",
    "the space - time structure of particle propagation can not be described by such a calculation .    because equal velocities are assumed , i.e. that both neutrinos are produced at one space time point and both detected at another , kayser obtains the standard oscillation phase , a result shown to be unmodified  @xcite by convolution with a narrow momentum wave packet .",
    "ten years after kayser s paper on wave packets in neutrino oscillations the first of many papers where spatial wave packets , as suggested by kayser , were implemented using gaussian functions , was written by giunti kim and lee  @xcite .",
    "this paper starts with the statement :    ` if neutrinos are massive particles and mixed , a flavour neutrino is created by a weak - interaction process as a coherent superposition of mass eigenstates . '",
    "this statement is in contradiction with the findings of shrock  @xcite that , if non - degenerate massive neutrinos exist , lepton flavour is not conserved by the weak interaction , so that the different mass eigenstates are produced incoherently in different physical processes .",
    "it implies that , as previously assumed by kayser ( and all subsequent authors of papers on the qm of neutrino oscillations ) that all neutrinos are produced at the same time . therefore they must satisfy the equal velocity hypothesis of section 2 above , and independently of the introduction , or not , of spatial wave packets , or the assumption , or not , of exact energy - momentum conservation in the production process",
    ", the standard result for the oscillation phase must be obtained .",
    "the introduction of reference  @xcite contained a list of issues that it was claimed should be addressed in order to provide a ` complete ' treatment of the qm of neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is instructive to review this list from the perspective of the work presented in the present paper and references  @xcite .",
    "the four issues were :    * `",
    "a necessary condition for neutrino oscillations to occur is that the neutrino source and detector are localised within a region much smaller than the oscillation length ; then the neutrino momentum has at least the corresponding spread given by the uncertainty principle  @xcite . '",
    "* ` the energy - momentum conservation in the process in which the neutrino is created implies that different mass - eigenstate components have different momenta as well as different energies  @xcite . '",
    "* ` the different mass eigenstates must be produced and detected coherently ; this is possible only if the other particles associated with the production and decay processes have energy momentum spreads larger than the energy momentum differences of the mass eigenstates . '",
    "* ` the wave function of the propagating neutrino must be a superposition of the wavefunctions of the mass eigenstates with proper coefficients given by the amplitudes of the processes in which the mass eigenstate neutrinos are produced . '",
    "the following comments ( c ) may be made made on these points :    * the first sentence is trivially correct , but is unrelated to the quantum mechanical aspects of the problem .",
    "the last phrase , based as it is on the arguments of kayser ( eqn(6.1 ) ) is , as argued above , demonstrably without physical foundation .",
    "* this is indeed an essential ingredient of a correct treatment , in qm , of neutrino oscillations .",
    "a corollary is that the neutrinos , propagating over macroscopic distances , do so as classical particles  @xcite .",
    "this condition is violated by the universal equal velocity assumption of eqn(2.12 ) .",
    "* properly interpreted , the first sentence is correct .",
    "it means that the amplitudes describing the temporal sequence of events : a ) propagation of the source , b ) decay of the source , c ) propagation of a neutrino mass eigenstate and d ) production of the detection event must be added coherently .",
    "it does not mean that the mass eigenstates are part of a coherent ` flavour eigenstate ' in either the detection or production processes . the last phrase , as shown explictly for the case of pion decay at rest in section 5 above , is false .",
    "* the ` wavefunction ' referred to here is presumably a lepton flavour eigenstate propagating in space - time .",
    "as previously pointed out by shrock  @xcite and shown later by giunti , kim and lee themselves  @xcite ,",
    "such a state does not exist .",
    "the effect of the gaussian wave packet introduced in reference  @xcite on the oscillation phase is described in section 3 above . for a critical discussion of the ` spatial coherence length ' and ` momentum damping factor ' generated by such wave packets",
    "see reference  @xcite .",
    "the point of view , explained there , of the present author is that , as the coherent spatial wave packet from which they are derived does not exist , they also are without any physical foundation .",
    "the oscillations are damped by the source lifetime , as shown in eqn(5.20 ) , and also by the width of the coherent momentum wave packet associated with the different possible physical masses of unobserved recoil particles produced in the production process . as shown in reference  @xcite ,",
    "both effects are expected to be vanishingly small in any forseeable neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "an influential paper on the qm of heavy quark flavour oscillations was written by lipkin  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were applied to neutrino oscillations in reference  @xcite and in an unpublished pre - print  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of reference  @xcite was the correct observation that all experiments measuring flavour oscillations actually observe only a spatially varying interference effect .",
    "this implies that all decay and detection times should be integrated over in order to derive the quantum mechanical probability to be compared with experiment .",
    "this is done , for example , in the derivation of eqn(5.20 ) above .",
    "lipkin interpreted this correct statement about the nature of the experiments as implying that time should not appear at all in the theoretical description of the experiments .",
    "formulae containing the time were referred to as describing ` non experiments ' . in all three papers cited above the initial state",
    "is incorrectly assumed to be in a pure flavour eigenstate that is a superposition of mass eigenstates .",
    "thus , for example the @xmath326 and the @xmath327 , or the different neutrino mass eigenstates are assumed to be produced at the same time . since they must be detected at the same time , as only one detection event",
    "is observed , the equal velocity hypothesis ( 2.12 ) is thus assumed . since the additional assumption of equal energies and different momenta of the particles is made ( of course in logical contradiction with the equal velocity hypothesis ) the temporal part of the lorentz invariant plane wave does not contribute to the oscillation phase .",
    "the latter is then entirely determined by the spatial part , as described in section 4 above . the standard result for the oscillation phase",
    "is then obtained .",
    "the arguments given by lipkin to justify the choice of equal energies and different momenta of the propagating mass eigenstates are unconvincing . in the process @xmath328 lipkin states that ` energy conservation requires the @xmath329 to have a definite energy .",
    "when it is split into @xmath330 and @xmath331 components with different masses the two states have the same energy but different momenta ' .",
    "there would seem to be no physical justification for this apodictic statement .",
    "momentum conservation requires the @xmath329 to be produced with a definite momentum .",
    "why should it not then ` split ' into two states with the same momentum , and different energies ?",
    "later lipkin gives an argument based on non - relativistic kinematics ( eqn(2b ) of reference  @xcite ) as applied to the process @xmath328 to justify the neglect of the energy difference between the @xmath330 and @xmath331 . repeating the calculation using relativistic kinematics , as more appropriate to typical experimental conditions , shows instead that @xmath332 , so that there is , in this case , no kinematical justification for the equal energy hypothesis .",
    "actually the @xmath330 and @xmath331 , like the different neutrino mass eigenstates , are produced incoherently , in different physical processes , so that there is no production of the state ` @xmath333 ' .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum then shows that they must have different energies , different momenta and different velocities .",
    "in reference  @xcite a calculation of the oscillation phase for the @xmath334 system is performed in the laboratory system using temporal evolution , and allowing different propagation times for the different mass eigenstates ( eqn 9b of reference  @xcite ) . as discussed in section 4 above , this corresponds to the full lorentz invariant phase in the non - relativistic limit where @xmath335 . in this limit the complete o(@xmath30 ) gribov - pontecorvo result , with the oscillation phase a factor two larger than the standard result , is obtained .",
    "lipkin noticed this difference but rejected the correct result given , in the appropriate kinematical limit , by his eqn 9b on the grounds that , as the time appeared explicitly in its derivation , it corresponded to a ` non - experiment ' .    in reference",
    "@xcite , similar arguments are applied to the neutrino oscillation case . again",
    ", equal energies and different momenta and the ( contradictory ) equal velocity hypotheses are assumed , leading to the standard oscillation phase .",
    "the initial state is required to be a superposition of different mass eigenstates with pure flavour .",
    "for example , in the case of say @xmath336 , the probability of detecting a @xmath208 is zero , and of detecting a @xmath207 is unity , at @xmath337 .",
    "these conditions are used to fix the coefficients of the mass eigenstate superposition at @xmath337 .",
    "however , as is shown by inspection of eqn(5.21 ) above , exactly the same boundary condition is respected by the result of the feynman path amplitude calculation where the @xmath209 decays incoherently into the different mass eigenstates at different times and no unphysical ` flavour eigenstate wavefunction ' is introduced .",
    "it was claimed in reference  @xcite that the energy - momentum and space - time descriptions of flavour oscillations are ` complementary ' and that including them both leads to ` double counting ' of the oscillation phase by a factor of two .",
    "in fact , the lorentz invariant oscillation phase contains ( except in the rest frame of the propagating particle ) both energy - momentum and space - time contributions that must both be included to obtain the correct result .",
    "the detailed considerations of sections 2 - 4 above show that attempts to use only energy - momentum or space - time descriptions in inappropriate kinematical regions leads instead to ` half counting ' of the correct lorentz invariant phase .",
    "in reference  @xcite , lipkin justified the ` equal energy ' hypothesis by reference to a paper by stodolsky  @xcite which attempted a non relativistic density matrix description of flavour oscillations .",
    "it was proposed to use ` stationary ' beams of fixed energy to describe the system of propagating mass eigenstates . in this way",
    "the introduction of spatial wave packets was avoided .",
    "the present writer s opinion is that such an approach is ill - founded .",
    "in fact , the propagating particles describe classical trajectories , the detailed spatio - temporal structure of which is essential for the correct qm description of the phenomenon .",
    "this information is not available in the non - relativistic density matrix approach , which in any case , is not appropriate to describe ultra - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "the ` stationary ' source and target description with equal energies and different momenta for the neutrinos as well as gaussian spatial wave packets for both the source and detector was used more recently by ioannisian and pilaftsis  @xcite . as the equal velocity assumption ( 2.12 )",
    "was also made the standard oscillation phase was obtained .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in an earlier paper , written together with kayser  @xcite stodolsky proposed a covariant feynman path amplitude approach , akin to that of the present paper and references  @xcite , to the description of ` entangled ' systems such as @xmath338 . in this case , in contradiction to reference  @xcite , and as previously assumed by kayser  @xcite , equal momenta and different energies were proposed .",
    "the treatment of reference  @xcite differs from that of the present paper and references  @xcite in that the equal velocity hypothesis ( 2.12 ) was assumed , so that the standard oscillation formula was obtained and the contribution to the oscillation phase of the coherent source was neglected .",
    "also , unphysical spatial wave packets were introduced and the potentially important velocity smearing effects due to variations of order @xmath339 in the physical mass of the @xmath331 , as discussed in section 5 above , were neglected .",
    "the present writer is in agreement with the main conclusion of this paper , that the ` collapse of the wavefunction ' often discussed in connection with entangled states , is only the collapse of a mathematical abstraction , that is actually irrelevant to the qm description of the experiment .",
    "it is perhaps , however , going a little too far to state , as in the last sentence of reference  @xcite that : ` the best answer , finally to the ` question of the collapse of the wavefunction ' is that there is no wavefunction . ' indeed , the qm of flavour oscillations is better described in terms of feynman path amplitudes , as proposed in reference  @xcite , however , the wavefunction does remain an important and useful concept in the description of ` static ' bound systems such as the hydrogen atom .",
    "following rich  @xcite several authors  @xcite have used a non - relativistic wigner - weisskopf type formalism to describe the complete production - propagation - detection process .",
    "the propagating virtual neutrinos are assigned the same energy and different momenta . in all cases",
    "the equal velocity assumption is made leading to the standard oscillation phase .",
    "the present writer s opinion is that such treatments take properly into account neither the ultra - relativistic nature of the propagating neutrinos nor the sequence of spatio - temporal production and detection events necessary for a correct calculation of the oscillation phase . in one paper using this non - relativistic approach  @xcite , the effect of the source lifetime was discussed .",
    "although it was correctly concluded that the damping effect due to the finite source lifetime is negligible , it was proposed that the characterstic momentum spread in the gaussian wave packet , related to the source , for muon decay at rest ( actually the fourier transform of a gaussian spatial wave packet as proposed by giunti kim and lee  @xcite following the suggestion of kayser  @xcite ) should be @xmath340 mev .",
    "this is the typical momentum due to thermal motion at room temperature .",
    "as discussed above , any momentum smearing due to this source or to the physical mass of the decaying muon is incoherent and not associated with any wave packet . indeed , in the case of muon decay , since all recoil particles are stable , then , unlike in the case of pion decay , there is is no momentum wavepacket associated with neutrino propagation .    the equal energy , different momentum , hypothesis was also made by the authors of reference  @xcite .",
    "this was justified by assuming that both production and detection of neutrinos resulted from inelastic scattering on an infinitely heavy target .",
    "although such an assumption guarantees the kinematical correctness of the equal energy hypothesis , it evidently does not correspond to actual neutrino experiments where the neutrinos are produced by the decay of an unstable source , and where energy - momentum conservation always requires ( see eqns(2.6),(2.7 ) above ) that both momenta and energies and , hence the velocities , are different .",
    "the equal velocity hypothesis ( in contradiction with the different momenta of the neutrinos ) was also made so that the neutrino propagator is purely spatial , giving , as shown in section 4 above , the standard oscillation phase .",
    "many of the features of the covariant path amplitude calculation of section 5 above and references  @xcite have been previously introduced into the discussion of neutrino oscillations .",
    "for example , the lorentz invariant feynman propagator for the neutrinos has been used in references  @xcite . the only author to introduce explicitly the invariant propagator of the source particle was campagne  @xcite .",
    "as the equal velocity hypothesis was also made there is no contribution to the oscillation phase from this propagator and the standard result was obtained for the oscillation phase .",
    "the authors of reference  @xcite recognised that the derivation of the standard formula required the equal velocity hypothesis , and that if exact energy - momentum conservation is imposed , so that the neutrinos have different times - of - flight , an oscillation phase a factor of two larger is obtained . in spite of noting that neutrinos of widely differing masses , as expected theoretically , can not have equal velocities ,",
    "the use of the equal velocity hypothesis was , nevertheless , recommended .",
    "a short note of okun and tsukerman  @xcite pointed out the kinematical impossibility of the equal velocity assumption for neutrinos with different masses .    a paper by giunti  @xcite considering the analogy between the interference effects in the young double slit experiment and in neutrino oscillations , claimed to demonstrate that the extra factor of two in the oscillation phase , due to neutrino propagation , obtained when the different neutrino velocities are correctly taken into account  @xcite , is incorrect .",
    "this argument was based on the correct observation that in the young double slit experiment with photons , photon propagation gives no contribution to the interference phase .",
    "that this must be so is evident by setting @xmath341 in eqn(5.9 ) above .",
    "giunti then claimed to have rejected the different velocity hypothesis  @xcite and the path amplitude calculations of reference  @xcite by _ reductio ad absurdum _ since , in the analagous young double slit experiment , a vanishing interference phase , clearly excluded by experiment , is apparently predicted .",
    "however , giunti neglects the contribution to the interference phase of the coherent source ( the excited atom that produces the photon ) .",
    "the contribution of the source to the interference phase is , using the formula analagous to eqn(5.7 ) above , for an atomic radiative transition : @xmath342 where @xmath343 , and @xmath344 are respectively the atomic excitation energy and the photon energy , while @xmath345 and @xmath346 are defined in reference  @xcite .",
    "this formula is identical to eqn(8 ) of reference  @xcite , and since the contributions from the photon propagators vanish , the path amplitude calculation gives the usual result obtained in the classical wave theory of light .",
    "having wrongly concluded that the photon is produced at a unique time , giunti introduces a hypothetical gaussian spatial wave packet ( unphysical , because it has no relation to the physics of the photon production process ) and demonstrates that the space - time smearing provided by the wave packet allows to recover the same interference phase as in eqn(6.2 ) above .",
    "also the interference term is found to be damped by a factor dependent on the length of the wave packet . as discussed in reference  @xcite , as well as above in the present paper ,",
    "this damping factor , derived from the spurious spatial wave packet is also without any physical foundation .",
    "the damping of the interference term is actually produced by the finite lifetime of the coherent source that limits the value of @xmath347 in eqn(6.2 ) .",
    "a recent paper by de leo , nishi and rotelli  @xcite has also considered the effect on the oscillation phase of different kinematical assumptions . as in reference",
    "@xcite it was realised that only in the case of the equal velocity hypothesis is the standard oscillation phase obtained ; in any other case the phase is a factor of two larger .",
    "this agrees with the conclusions of sections 2 , 3 and 4 of the present paper .",
    "the difference between the kinematical discussions of the present paper and those of reference  @xcite is that in the former case , in accordance with the experimental conditions , and as previously pointed out in reference  @xcite , a constant distance , @xmath27 , is assumed between the source and the detection event . in the latter case",
    "this distance is allowed to vary , and also different creation times are allowed for the mass eigenstates . in the general kinematical discussion of section ii of reference  @xcite , which may be compared to section 2 above ( since both discuss the lorentz invariant oscillation phase ) it is assumed that @xmath58 is the same , but that @xmath57 is different for the different neutrinos .",
    "this is in complete disagreement with the experimental conditions of typical neutrino oscillation experiments . in order to permit different source - detector separations ,",
    "a gaussian spatial wave packet was introduced .",
    "it was concluded that by a suitable choice of creation times a pure flavour eigenstate can be obtained at creation . indeed",
    "the necessary existence of such a state is the initial hypothesis on which the arguments given in the paper are based .",
    "it may be commented that , firstly , as pointed out long ago by shrock  @xcite no such flavour eigenstate exists since the neutrinos are created in separate , incoherent , processes , and secondly , the distance @xmath27 must be constant , since the source is assumed to be at rest . finally , although it is true that the different neutrinos may be created at different times , the spatial wave packet introduced to allow the possibility of different source - detector distances does not , as argued above , have any physical basis .    a very recent paper by beuthe  @xcite makes the same basic assumptions as an earlier paper by giunti _ et al _  @xcite . both equal energy and equal energy hypotheses",
    "are considered , but the equal velocity condition ( 2.12 ) is always assumed so that the standard oscillation phase is always recovered , and the important contribution to the oscillation phase of the coherent source particle is neglected . there is a lengthy discussion of the effects of hypothetical gaussian wave packets used to describe both the source and detector particles .",
    "further critical discussion of different treatments in the literature of the qm of neutrino oscillations may be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the same paper also describes briefly two atomic physics experiments , the ` quantum beat ' experiment  @xcite and the ` photodetachment microscope '  @xcite where the feynman path amplitude description has been successfully tested in experiments where spatially varying interference effects , very similar to particle flavour oscillations , have been observed .",
    "the kinematical and geometrical discussion of sections 2 , 3 and 4 above shows that the standard formula ( 1.5 ) , for the contribution of neutrino propagation to the oscillation phase , is a consequence of the equal velocity hypothesis where it is assumed that both interfering neutrinos are produced at the same space - time point .",
    "this hypothesis is incompatible with the propagation of the neutrinos along classical space - time trajectories if they have different masses .",
    "the oscillation phase , calculated at o(@xmath30 ) , using the equal velocity hypothesis is found to be a factor of two smaller than the result first obtained by gribov and pontecorvo  @xcite .",
    "the latter is obtained by imposing both exact energy - momentum conservation and a consistent geometrical propagation in space - time , taking properly into account the different neutrino velocities .",
    "it is referred to above as the ` exact ' o(@xmath30 ) formula .",
    "thus the standard formula neglects numerically important o(@xmath30 ) terms as compared to the exact one .",
    "this conclusion remains the same whether the neutrino propagator is described in a lorentz invariant manner using plane waves ( section 2 ) , whether convolution with a gaussian wave packet is performed ( section 3 ) or whether only temporal or spatial evolution of the neutrino wave function is considered ( section 4 ) .",
    "in contrast , the assumptions of equal momenta and different energies or of equal energies but different momenta give only negligible o(@xmath31 ) corrections to the exact formula , or to the standard formula , as compared to the phase calculated assuming exact energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the feynman path amplitude calculation of section 5 is based on the use of the exact lorentz invariant plane wave formula ( or , equivalently , the invariant feynman space - time propagator ) for the contribution of neutrino propagation to the oscillation phase .",
    "since the different neutrino mass eigenstates are produced in independent physical processes  @xcite the decay of the source can occur at different times in the amplitudes describing the propagation of different neutrinos .",
    "the oscillation phenomenon then occurs respecting the constraints of both exact energy - momentum conservation and exact space - time geometry .",
    "the different decay times of the source in the interfering amplitudes then lead to an important contribution to the oscillation phase from the space - time propagator of the source .",
    "damping of the interference term due to the finite source lifetime or momentum smearing related to the off - shell nature of the source or recoil particles has been previously found to be completely negligible in all foreseeable neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "all previous calculations in the literature in which the standard oscillation phase is obtained assume the production of a coherent ` neutrino flavour eigenstate ' in the decay process , that is a quantum superposition of mass eigenstates .",
    "this enforces equal production times for the all mass eigenstates and hence the equal velocity condition .",
    "as pointed out in references  @xcite such a ` neutrino flavour eigenstate ' does not exist .",
    "the different neutrino mass eigenstates are produced incoherently in different physical processes .",
    "this universal , incorrect , assumption concerning the nature of the initial state of the neutrinos thus explains why the standard oscillation phase has been , hitherto , universally obtained .",
    "thus the contribution to the oscillation phase of neutrino propagation has been generally underestimated by a factor of two , and the important contribution to the phase of the coherent source ( resulting from different source decay times in the interfering amplitudes ) has been universally neglected .    as discussed in some detail in section 6 , in order to enable the interference phenomenon , leading to ` neutrino oscillations ' to occur when the different mass eigenstates are produced at the same time inside the ` neutrino flavour eigenstate ' it was proposed  @xcite to introduce a spatial wave packet to delocalise the neutrinos . moving with different velocities along classical trajectories , and produced at the same space time - point ,",
    "it is clear the neutrinos can never arrive together at the unique space - time point of the detection event .",
    "the spatial ` fuzziness ' introduced by the hypothetical wave packets , associated with each neutrino , was conjectured to enable them both to have non - vanishing amplitudes at the position of the detection event , so that neutrino oscillations can occur .",
    "in fact , because the interfering neutrinos can be produced at different times there is no need , to produce neutrino oscillations , for the spatial fuzziness introduced by the hypothetical wave packets .",
    "the hypothetical wave packet suggested in reference  @xcite does not exist in the qm calculation of the neutrino production process .",
    "the neutrinos ( particles ) are produced in space - time according to an exponential decay law .",
    "a ` wave packet ' is only a ( very loose ) analogy in classical wave theory to the effect of the lifetime of an unstable particle on the energy ( or mass ) distribution of its decay products . in the analogy",
    "this distribution is given by the fourier transform of the spatial wave packet , but no there is no such wave packet in the qm calculation itself .",
    "thus the ( mathematically convenient ) gaussian wave packets that abound in the literature on the qm of neutrino oscillations have no physical foundation within qm . the relevant ( related ) parameter , in the quantum mechanical calculation , is the mean lifetime of the source .",
    "there is no physical connection between this parameter and the length of a loosely analagous wave packet with an arbitary gaussian form .",
    "the introduction of such wave packets in the qm calculation mixes up in a confused way concepts from qm and a classical wave theory that contains no information on the space - time evolution of particle positions .",
    "the most important additional features of the present paper as compared to references  @xcite are , first , the realisation that the standard oscillation phase follows _ only _ from the manifestly unphysical equal velocity hypothsis and is quite unrelated to the use of gaussian wave packets or any of the other kinematical assumptions made in the derivations . the misleading impression may have been given in references  @xcite that the standard oscillation phase , when obtained in covariant calculations , was a consequence of the use of wave packets . the second is the realisation that the incoherent nature of the neutrino production process , which is the physical basis of the calculations presented in references  @xcite and section 5 above , was aleady pointed out more than twenty years ago by shrock  @xcite in the published literature .",
    "i was not aware of this work at the time of writing references  @xcite .    in closing a few remarks",
    "are made on phenomenology and experimental tests .",
    "the mass difference , @xmath348 , derived from experimental results using the standard formula , is related to that , @xmath349 , given by the feynman path amplitude calculation , by the formula ( valid for any source at rest ) : @xmath350 while for neutrino oscillations following two body decays in flight of ultra - relativistic charged pions or kaons  @xcite : @xmath351 where @xmath352 is defined after eqn(2.8 ) . in the case of experiments involving neutrino production in pion , kaon or muon decay",
    "the conversion is straightforward .",
    "however , for neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors the effective oscillation phase will require a suitable average , with appropriate weighting factors , over the decays of all @xmath0-unstable nuclei contributing to the neutrino flux . for a given nuclear species",
    "the correction factor , @xmath353 , to the standard oscillation phase is given , by eqn(7.1 ) , as @xmath354 , where @xmath227 is the total energy release in the decay .",
    "this is evidently an immense undertaking for any actual reactor - based experiment .",
    "any phenomeological conclusions hitherto drawn from the results of such experiments , using the standard formula , must therefore be discarded if the oscillation phase is correctly given by the path amplitude calculation .    of particular interest , in view of the recent results of the kamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite collaborations ,",
    "are the @xmath0-decay processes : @xmath355 contributing to the flux of high energy solar neutrinos .",
    "the correction factor , @xmath353 , in eqn(7.1 ) , is plotted in the range : @xmath356 in fig.1 . for @xmath357 @xmath0-decay , @xmath358 mev .",
    "the correction factor is unity when @xmath359 , corresponding to @xmath360 mev . near the kinematical end - point at @xmath361 mev , @xmath353 rises steeply , reaching a maximum value of about 1500 .",
    "thus neutrino oscillations , observable when @xmath362 , are strongly suppressed in the near end - point region . for the case of the electron capture reactions : @xmath363 contributing line spectra to the solar neutrino flux , @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the excitation energy of the unstable @xmath366 atom and @xmath367 , so that the oscillation phase of the path amplitude calculation is the same as that given by the standard formula .",
    "as already mentioned in reference  @xcite , evidence for neutrino oscillations in short baseline experiments such as lnsd  @xcite and karmen  @xcite can be confirmed or invalidated by a search for muon oscillations following pion decay at rest , since , the muon oscillation phase is found  @xcite to be identical to that of the associated neutrinos given in eqn(5.21 ) above .",
    "evidently the event rate in such muon oscillation experiments can exceed that possible in the search for the associated neutrino oscillations by many orders of magnitude .",
