    "spectroscopic studies of the solar corona indicate that its hot plasma is subject to chemical fractionation processes in which element abundances can be significantly modified with respect to the photospheric mixture .",
    "the abundance anomalies in the solar coronal plasma appear to be a function of the element s first ionization potential ( fip ) , with low fip elements ( @xmath0  ev ) found to be enhanced in the corona typically by a factor @xmath1 , and high fip elements ( @xmath2  ev ) having coronal abundances close to their photospheric values ( see _ left panel _ of fig .

    "there is no evidence supporting a mass dependence of the abundance variations @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the chemical composition of solar plasmas have shown that this `` fip effect '' varies in different types of solar features  with , e.g. , coronal holes , fast solar wind , and newly emerged active regions showing abundances close to photospheric , from structure to structure , and in time , as shown for instance by @xcite for active regions during their evolution ( see _ right panel _ of figure  [ fig : ab_sun ] ) .",
    "element abundances for the sun as a star , i.e. from full - disk integrated measurements , are surprisingly scarce ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and it is therefore challenging to estimate the abundances of integrated solar disk spectra from findings concerning specific solar features .",
    "@xcite , reanalyzing full - disk quiet sun spectra from @xcite , recovered the coronal fip effect for the million degree and hotter plasma , while the cooler plasma shows substantially smaller fractionation .",
    "they interpret this result as suggestion of a fip effect as a function of coronal height .",
    "abundances also appear to vary during flares ( see e.g. , @xcite ; and references in @xcite ) , and in particular there is considerable evidence of ne - enriched plasma in several flares ( see e.g. , review by @xcite , and references in @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are also flares where abundances appear to be coronal , i.e.  showing the typical fip effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "generally it is not straightforward to determine whether the observed anomalies correspond to an enhancement of low fip elements in the corona compared to their photospheric abundances , or whether on the contrary the high fip elements are depleted in the corona . the comparison of the intensity of coronal spectral lines with the underlying continuum emission , which for a solar - like composition arises primarily from h , allows investigation of this issue .",
    "@xcite reviews some results of analyses of solar x - ray spectra : although some studies seem to indicate a depletion of high fip elements ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most results appear to point to enrichment of low fip elements ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .    abundance patterns and their variations in different conditions are important because they provide insights into the physical processes leading to the chemical fractionation of the coronal plasmas , which are likely linked to the elusive heating mechanisms ( see  [ ssec : models ] where we briefly review the status of modeling of the abundance properties in the solar and stellar coronae ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the robustness of these findings was however difficult to assess because of several intrinsic limitations of the data .",
    "for instance , in low - resolution spectra , typically fitted with a few ( 1 - 3 ) isothermal components , emission lines and continuum are entangled and therefore thermal structure and abundances of single elements can not be tightly constrained .",
    "also in the higher resolution spectra obtained with _",
    "the determination of element abundances was somewhat hampered by the lack of strong lines of a large number of elements for a wide range of coronal thermal properties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "atomic data applied in global model fitting procedures were also largely untested against high resolution benchmarks , and suspicions of significant deficiencies in terms of completeness in some species were well - founded ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another fundamental issue to keep in mind when considering abundance anomalies in stellar coronae , is the fact that stellar photospheric abundances are often unknown , and stellar coronal values are compared with _ solar",
    "_ photospheric abundances .",
    "the determination of photospheric abundances is particularly difficult for active stars due to their typical rapid rotation , and subsequent line broadening .",
    "this caveat holds true not only for the early results discussed above , and we will discuss it in some more detail in the following .    in the past decade the high spectral resolution provided by the x - ray spectrometers onboard _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  has provided new , much more accurate , tools for abundance diagnostics . in these spectra , strong , relatively unblended emission lines of several elements ( e.g. , c , n ,",
    "o , ne , mg , si , s , fe ) formed over a wide temperature range provide accurate line - based abundance diagnostics .",
    "the first light spectrum of the active rs cvn binary system hr  1099 clearly showed significant abundance anomalies , in particular with evident fe underabundance and ne overabundance , and the overall indication of an `` inverse '' fip effect ( ifip ; @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : hr1099 ] ) , with coronal depletion of low fip elements and enhancement of high fip elements .",
    "studies of increasingly larger samples of high - resolution x - ray spectra of stellar coronae with different characteristics have fleshed out trends of abundance patterns as a function of stellar parameters . in particular",
    ", the abundance anomalies appear to change as a function of stellar activity .",
    "@xcite had shown the presence of ifip in several active stars ( see also e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hinted at a transition from ifip to fip effect for decreasing stellar activity .",
    "this effect is evident in large samples of stars when looking at the abundance ratio of the low - fip element fe over the high - fip element o , as a function of the fractional x - ray to bolometric luminosity ( @xmath6 ) , which is a measure of the activity level ( e.g. , @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : feoneo ] ) .",
    "the fe / o observed ratios span a wide range , varying by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite have recently carried out a study of the `` sun in time '' analyzing high - resolution x - ray spectra of six solar analogs at different evolutionary stages ( and ages from 0.1 to 1.6  gyr ) , and studying the evolution of the characteristics of x - ray emission .",
    "they found a decline of x - ray activity in all its aspects x - ray luminosity , flare rate , peak coronal temperature and also found indication of a corresponding evolution of coronal abundances from an ifip effect , in the early active stages , to a solar - like fip effect on short timescales ( @xmath7  myr , much smaller than the main - sequence lifetime of solar - like stars ) .",
    "studies of the ne / o abundance ratio in stellar coronae , compared to the sun , have brought about interesting results and some heated debate .",
    "as shown for instance in figure  [ fig : feoneo ] ( _ right panel _ ; see also @xcite ) , the ne / o ratio is rather constant over a wide range of activity levels for a discussion about abundance anomalies in pre - main sequence low - mass stars . ] . this is not surprising as ne and o both have high fip , and therefore no strong relative fractionation is expected for these two elements .",
    "it is however intriguing that the ne / o ratio in stellar coronae appears systematically higher ( by roughly a factor 2 ) than the assumed solar photospheric value and typical solar coronal measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this might have important repercussions on an outstanding issue in the modeling of the solar interior .",
    "recently , the use of new realistic 3d time - dependent hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere ( accounting for the effects of , e.g. , convective flows and granulation ) , together with improvements of atomic data , and relaxation of local thermal equilibrium conditions , has led to a significant downward revision of abundances of several abundant elements , such as c , n , o @xcite , with respect to the widely used compilation of @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , broke the previous agreement between helioseismology data and models of the solar interior @xcite , because of the reduction of opacity due to the lower c , n , o abundances .",
    "an accurate determination of the ne abundance is potentially important for this issue , because ne is an abundant element and it contributes significantly to the opacity in the solar interior .",
    "unfortunately , the ne abundance can not be measured in the solar photosphere because of a lack of photospheric lines ( due to its high ionization potential ) . as a result",
    ", its abundance needs to be inferred indirectly , and it is typically scaled from measurements of solar corona and solar wind by assuming the same ne / o ratio . if the higher ne / o of stellar coronae is assumed to reflect the underlying photospheric abundance , and the lower solar coronal ne / o ( and a few other very low activity stars , @xcite ) is explained in terms of depletion of ne with respect to the photospheric composition as also predicted by some models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see discussion about models in  [ ssec : models ] ) , the higher photospheric ne might provide enough opacity to help resolve the `` solar model problem '' @xcite .",
    "however , it now seems unlikely that neon can provide the full solution @xcite . also , recent studies of b - type stars , which have photospheric ne lines because of their hotter photospheric temperatures with respect to solar - like stars , suggest that for those stars the ne abundance might be higher than the adopted solar photospheric value but not quite as high a observed in active coronae ( see e.g. , @xcite , and also @xcite who find ne / o values only slightly higher than the solar adopted value ; see also @xcite for studies on pne ) .",
    "the scenario depicted above , while likely holding in general terms , can break down significantly when looking at specific cases .",
    "one very interesting and puzzling case is presented by the binary system 70  oph studied by @xcite : the nearly identical stellar components ( age , spectral type , activity level , rotation period ) have somewhat different properties of their coronal abundances : one component , 70  oph  a ( @xmath8 ) , shows a prominent solar - like fip effect , whereas the other component , 70  oph  b ( @xmath9 ) , is characterized by no evident fip or maybe a even mild ifip effect .",
    "@xcite analyze a sample of solar - like stars with low to moderate activity ( @xmath10  erg / s ) and find a good correlation of fip effect with spectral type ( see _ left panel _ of figure  [ fig : fip_spectype ] ; we note that for this sample no clear correlation is present between fip bias and activity level ) .",
    "they find that this correlation considerably weakens when more active stars are included and argue that the rapid stellar rotation in these higher activity stars induces modifications to the fundamental stellar properties to which the fractionation processes might be sensitive .",
    "this might be in line with some evidence obtained through the study of young pre - main sequence stars : @xcite and @xcite have studied t tauri stars and found some indication of a possible dependence of the fip effect on the stellar spectral type ( see _ right panel _ of figure  [ fig : fip_spectype ] , and also  [ sec : tts ] , and @xcite ) .",
    "abundance variations in stellar coronae during flares are difficult to establish .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy requires a large number of photons , and with the limited effective areas of the present - day x - ray observatories it is still difficult to carry out detailed time - resolved spectroscopic analysis .",
    "another potential difficulty in deriving abundances reliably from flare spectra is the fact that departures from ionization equilibrium conditions are more likely in flare conditions , whereas spectral modeling usually assumes equilibrium conditions .",
    "previously , analysis of low resolution spectra of a few large flares in active stars provided evidence for an increase in low - fip element abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for these spectra , fe often has the better constrained abundance , and uncertainties on derived abundances are generally large ) .",
    "the studies carried out so far on high - resolution spectra suggest in most cases that during flares the abundance anomalies get milder , i.e. , abundances appear to get closer to photospheric values during the flare , no matter whether the `` quiescent '' spectrum is characterized by the fip or ifip effect @xcite .",
    "this effect , if confirmed , is consistent with the chromospheric evaporation scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it also supports that the observed abundance trends are a real coronal phenomenon and are not simply reflecting photospheric abundance peculiarities .",
    "the sample is however biased towards high - activity stars , and therefore further investigations are needed to confirm this finding .",
    "it is also worth noting that there are examples of large flares where no significant abundance changes are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "gravity , temperature gradients , electric and magnetic fields , are all expected to affect the chemical composition of the coronal plasma by acting selectively on the elements depending on either the mass of the ion ( e.g. , gravitational settling , thermal diffusion ) , or on the charge of the ion ( e.g. , frictional drag ) , or on its charge - to - mass ratio ( e.g. , ambipolar diffusion ) . at the same time",

    "this finding suggests that , in general , accretion related processes are not modifying significantly the chemical composition of the coronae of young active stars .",
    "studies of abundances from large samples of x - ray spectra of tts have yielded results sometimes not easily reconciled with the findings for more evolved late - type stars .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied ccd - resolution _ chandra _  spectra of 146 bright orion sources and find that for the sample as a whole , and using a set of stellar photospheric abundances or abundances of the orion nebula as a reference , only fe appears significantly fractionated , depleted by a factor 1.5 - 3 .",
    "this result might either indicate that the abundances used as the photospheric reference do not represent accurately the photospheric composition of this sample , or it might point instead to an actual absence of a clear ifip effect at variance with the results discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : stars ] for more evolved stars with similar activity levels .",
    "this latter case would imply significant differences in the fractionation processes at work in these young stars with respect to their more evolved counterparts .",
    "@xcite from the high resolution _",
    "xmm - newton _  spectra of 9 tts find that a fip dependent fractionation effect is present and seems to change as a function of the stellar spectral type .",
    "specifically ne is overabundant ( ne / fe @xmath28 times solar ) in k and m - type stars , while earlier type have higher fe abundance ( see right panel of figure  [ fig : fip_spectype ] ) . stellar mass and gravity do not appear to influence the coronal abundances .",
    "although this result echoes the results found by @xcite for solar - like main sequence stars ( as discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : stars ] ) , the young stars studied by @xcite are much more active , with typical luminosities above @xmath29  erg / s , i.e.  in the range of activity where the correlation of fip bias and spectral type found by @xcite breaks . in summary ,",
    "the possible dependence of element fractionation mechanisms on the spectral type and evolutionary phase is an open issue to be addressed through the study of larger samples of stars , both in early evolutionary stages and in main sequence .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed recent advances in our understanding of the chemical composition of x - ray emitting plasma in stars brought about in the past decade .",
    "in particular , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy with _",
    "chandra _  and",
    "_ xmm - newton_has allowed robust determination of the element abundances from x - ray spectra indicating that the abundance anomalies in stellar coronae are real and not an artifact of the modeling of low and medium resolution spectra .",
    "abundance anomalies in coronae of cool stars are largely described by fractionation processes dependent on the element s first ionization potential , and they appear to be a function of the stellar x - ray activity level . a solar - like fip effect ( abundance enhancement of low - fip elements in coronal plasma ) is typically observed in other low to intermediate activity stars similar to the sun , whereas high activity stars are characterized by an inverse fip effect ( depletion of low - fip elements in the corona ) .",
    "these findings , however , heavily rely on the assumption that the often unknown underlying stellar photospheric abundances are similar to the solar photospheric abundances .",
    "more photospheric abundance studies are needed in order to uncover the true coronal abundance anomalies in a more reliable way and firmly establish the validity of the apparent trends .",
    "the abundance of neon shows an interesting pattern with active stars showing a ne / o abundance ratio significantly larger than the sun and other low activity stars",
    ". this might point to a fractionation of ne in coronal plasma , either depletion in solar - like activity stars or enhancement in active stars , and raises the issue of what the photospheric ne abundance is in the sun and in nearby stars .",
    "studies of flares suggest significant abundance variations compared to quiescent conditions , though the limited quality of the time - resolved spectroscopy achievable at present , and the effects of non - equilibrium , which are difficult to model and constrain , cast some doubts on the robustness of these findings .",
    "improved capabilities for temporally resolved spectral diagnostics are required to be able to confirm these results .",
    "recent studies also suggest that the chemical fractionation of coronal plasma might depend on the stellar spectral type .",
    "this dependence , however , appears to apply only to low to intermediate activity stars , with possibly important consequences in the context of developing a theoretical framework to interpret the abundance anomalies .",
    "in fact , this finding can put significant constraints on the models as it might suggest that instead of a unique mechanism of fractionation for all coronae , different processes might be dominant in stars similar to the sun and in stars with higher activity level .    for massive stars , an accurate knowledge of the abundances of their x - ray emitting plasmas is still lacking .",
    "however , recent investigations with high - resolution spectra have produced interesting results , suggesting subsolar fe abundance for several early - type stars , and a possible temperature dependent solar - like fip effect in some sources with hard x - ray spectra .    in young low - mass stars",
    "the chemical composition of x - ray plasmas typically shows characteristics analogous to more evolved stars with similar activity levels , i.e. , an inverse fip effect , in particular with low fe abundance and high ne .",
    "also for pre - main sequence stars more reliable photospheric abundances need to be determined in order to establish the actual extent of these apparent coronal abundance anomalies .",
    "the coronal abundances of t tauri stars do not appear to depend on the presence of ongoing accretion or lack thereof .",
    "a few unusually old accreting t tauri stars show peculiarly high ne / o abundance ratio in their x - ray emission ; this anomalous chemical composition is suggestive of advanced evolution of the circumstellar disk yielding depletion of grain - forming elements , compared to ne which is volatile .",
    "these abundance peculiarities , however , are not found consistently in other old accreting t tauri stars therefore questioning the validity of this scenario .",
    "although the study of the element abundances in stellar x - ray plasmas has recently yielded significant progress , substantial improvements on both the observational constraints and theoretical models are required to begin understanding the physics of chemical fractionation in stars .",
    "this process is likely connected to the yet poorly understood mechanism(s ) of mass and energy transport to the corona , which are among the most fundamental open issues in astrophysics ."
