    "the knowledge of the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of small magnetic systems such as magnetic molecules is indispensable for a complete understanding of their spectroscopic , dynamic , and thermodynamic properties . in this respect",
    "the numerical exact diagonalization of the appropriate quantum hamiltonian is the method of choice .",
    "nevertheless , such an attempt is very often severely restricted due to the huge dimension of the underlying hilbert space . for a magnetic system of @xmath0 spins of spin quantum number @xmath1",
    "the dimension is @xmath2 which grows exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "group theoretical methods can help to ease this numerical problem .",
    "along these lines much effort has been put into the development of an efficient numerical diagonalization technique of the heisenberg model @xmath3 using irreducible tensor operators and thus employing su(2 ) symmetry of angular momenta @xcite . a combination of this meanwhile well established technique with point - group symmetries could be developed over the past years , first for those point - group symmetries that are compatible with the spin coupling scheme , i.e. avoid complicated basis transforms between different coupling schemes @xcite , later also for general point groups @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if the dimension of the largest hilbert subspace exceeds about @xmath4 complete numerically exact diagonalization is no longer possible with current computers and programs .",
    "fortunately , a few very accurate approximations have been developed that can be applied to quantum spin systems . in this article",
    "we are going to discuss the finite temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and its dynamical variant as well as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) .    for problems with hilbert space dimensions of up to roughly @xmath5  the finite temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) provides a very accurate and astonishingly easy to program method @xcite . in recent publications we demonstrated that this method is indeed capable of evaluating thermodynamic observables for magnetic molecules with an accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from exact results @xcite .",
    "so far we encountered only one problem where achieving a satisfying accuracy posed a problem ",
    "the fe@xmath6 ferric wheel @xcite .",
    "mathematically this methods relies on the idea of trace estimators @xcite ; it is not restricted to spin systems and for instance also applied in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method is a variational method that approximates the true eigenstates by so - called matrix - product states @xcite .",
    "these states are iteratively constructed , thus the method allows to treat the full heisenberg hamiltonian but in a reduced hilbert space .",
    "the hilbert space is truncated in a controlled way and the accuracy of the method can be estimated with the help of a truncation error . in the field of molecular magnetism dmrg has been applied for instance to the heisenberg icosidodecahedron with @xmath7 @xcite , i.e. a model of the mo@xmath8fe@xmath9keplerate @xcite .",
    "dmrg can be extended in order to evaluate transition matrix elements .",
    "this variant is called dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) ; it aims at the calculation of dynamical correlation functions as needed for the description of inelastic neutron scattering cross sections @xcite . in a recent article",
    "we could show that ddmrg is able to model ins spectra of the very large magnetic ring molecule fe@xmath10 with unprecedented accuracy and thus allows to determine model parameters which would be impossible using only observables such as susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this extension is not discussed in this article .",
    "finally we would like to provide examples for the application of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite to magnetic molecules .",
    "this approximate method which works accurately only for non - frustrated quantum spin systems @xcite , has already been applied to several molecular systems by larry engelhardt @xcite .",
    "he also provides a very popular program ",
    "fit - mart  with which one can deduce heisenberg exchange parameters from susceptibility data @xcite .",
    "some of the discussed methods are freely available as program packages . besides fit - mart the program magpack @xcite can be used for complete diagonalization .",
    "approximate methods such as dmrg and qmc are provided by the alps package @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec-2 ]",
    "the finite - temperature lanczos method is introduced .",
    "section [ sec-3 ] discusses the application of quantum monte carlo , and section [ sec-4 ] briefly introduces to the density matrix renormalization group .",

    "the experimental magnetic studies of the \\{gd@xmath14mo@xmath11 } were accompanied on the theoretical side by calculations that replaced the gd spin of @xmath15 by fictitious spins @xmath7 since otherwise the calculation would not have been feasible in a reasonable time ( of several weeks [ sic ! ] ) .",
    "now , after a few months , the calculations using the finite - temperature lanczos method for @xmath16 spins @xmath15 are completed . before presenting the results a short reminder of the method shall be given which in detail is explained elsewhere @xcite .    for the evaluation of thermodynamic properties in the canonical ensemble the exact partition function @xmath17 depending on temperature @xmath18 and magnetic field @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes an orthonormal basis of the respective hilbert space . following the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite the unknown matrix elements are approximated as @xmath22 which yields for the partition function @xmath23 for this procedure @xmath24 is taken as the initial vector of a lanczos iteration .",
    "this iteration consists of @xmath25 lanczos steps , which span a respective krylow space , in which the hamiltonian is diagonalized .",

    "they are enumerated by @xmath28 .",
    "the number of lanczos steps @xmath25 is a parameter of the approximation ; @xmath29 is usually a good value .",
    "in addition , the complete and thus very large sum over all states @xmath24 is replaced by a summation over a subset of @xmath30 random vectors , where @xmath30 is the second parameter of the method . for many cases",
    "@xmath30 can be rather small , e.g. @xmath31 , whereas for other systems convergence is achieved only for @xmath32 .",

    "the entropy differences are rather large at low temperature as expected for a weakly couple gadolinium system .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite is a very powerful method for non - frustrated , i.e. bipartite quantum spin systems . for a discussion of frustration see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the method can easily deal with up to 100 or more spins . in the field of molecule - based magnetism",
    "is was applied to several spin systems , e.g. homo- and heterometallic rings @xcite as well as to a one - dimensional spin tube @xcite . in the latter publication",
    "the heat capacity of a system of @xmath43 spins with @xmath44 was calculated with the help of qmc .",

    "the solid curve displays the result of complete matrix diagonalization @xcite whereas the dotted curve depicts the qmc result.,width=302 ]",
    "dmrg is a technically rather involved method .",
    "one should however keep in mind that it is a variational method that constructs trial states in a certain way . being variational",
    "means that a lower energy for the trial ground state corresponds to having obtained a better approximation since the energy is bounded from below by the true value ( ritz s variational principle ) .",
    "a maybe helpful ( mis- ) conception of the idea of the method could be the following : assume that you want to describe an eight - membered spin chain as depicted in fig .",
    "[ am - fig-5 ] . one starts with a small subsystem of two spins , diagonalizes the hamiltonian and keeps only the lowest @xmath45 eigenstates .",
    "then one adds spins sequentially and every time sets up a new basis built of the old kept states and the states representing the added spin , diagonalizes the hamiltonian and again keeps the lowest @xmath45 states .",
    "this idea is brilliant ( and called numerical renormalization group ) , except that it does not work in this naive fashion .",
    "steve white found out , that instead of keeping the lowest @xmath45 eigenstates of the hamiltonian it is much better to keep @xmath45 eigenstates of a reduced density matrix in order to iteratively built up the system and to represent the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the density matrix is given by the target state , e.g. the ground state @xmath51 , as @xmath52 and to reduce it means to trace over a part of the system , i.e. one of the colored parts in fig .",
    "[ am - fig-5 ] .",
    "the representation can be further improved by running a so - called sweep algorithm in which the system is subdivided into unequal blocks for which the hamiltonian is diagonalized and the density matrix calculated .    for the non - expert",
    "this seems to be rather obscure , but contrary to several other methods , dmrg is ( 1 ) variational , ( 2 ) a controlled approximation , i.e. with @xmath46 one approaches the exact result , and ( 3 ) offers accuracy estimators in the form of the truncated weight or the entanglement entropy .",
    "an extrapolation to the exact result is thus possible by using these measures .",
    "although dmrg is best suited for open one - dimensional chain systems it can be applied to finite - size clusters , too .",
    "the resulting convergence , which is exponential in @xmath45 for one - dimensional chains , is somewhat slower , e.g. like @xmath53 for a spin cluster such as the icosidodecahedron @xcite .",
    "here we would like to demonstrate the power of the method by showing theoretical magnetization curves for another ferric wheel , this time an fe@xmath10 ring of @xmath54 spins with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space for this system is about @xmath55 which again renders an exact treatment impossible .",
    "the molecule was investigated by means of dmrg and ddmrg @xcite , the later results were compared to ins data and utilized to fix the parameters of the model .    , @xmath7 spin ring .",
    "we have kept up to 3000 density matrix eigenstates for the @xmath56 model and up to 1200 for the @xmath57 models .",
    "the truncated weights are smaller than @xmath58.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ am - fig-6 ] we present the @xmath59 magnetization curves for the three parameterizations discussed in @xcite .",
    "the results are very interesting .",
    "the magnetization curves are virtually identical up to 25  tesla .",
    "the step widths of the magnetization curve for a @xmath60-symmetric ring ( single @xmath61 ) are approximately the same for all steps ( apart from the very last steps ) , as would also be the case for the rotational band approximation @xcite .",
    "the magnetization curves for the other two models ( @xmath62-symmetric : @xmath12@xmath12@xmath13 ) deviate from this behavior .",
    "up to approximately 100  t , the two models with @xmath57 give very similar magnetization curves and considerable differences appear only at even higher fields . the magnetization curve for @xmath63  mev and @xmath64  mev shows two magnetization plateaus at higher fields .",
    "plateaus in zero - temperature magnetization curves usually emerge in geometrically frustrated spin systems @xcite .",
    "this system is , however , not geometrically frustrated so that the emergence of a plateau is an interesting effect .",
    "-component of the local magnetization ( which is proportional to @xmath65 ) for two different parameter sets as a function of an external magnetic field @xmath66 .",
    "the results were obtained using standard dmrg and @xmath67 .",
