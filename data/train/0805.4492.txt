    "resolving the emission regions of distant quasars is beyond the current capabilities of present - day telescopes , as direct imaging of accretion disks requires angular resolutions on the order of tens of nanoarcseconds at @xmath7 @xmath1 1 . until the spatial resolution of telescopes reaches this limit",

    "we observe microlensing as uncorrelated variability in the brightnesses of the images of a lensed quasar , where the amplitude of the variability is determined by the size of the emission regions ( e.g. , lewis et al .",
    "1998 ; popovic & chartas 2005 ) .",
    "the largest components , the radio , dust and optical line emission regions , should show little or no microlensing variability .",
    "the thermal continuum emission from the disk should show greater variability at shorter wavelengths corresponding to smaller disk radii and higher temperatures , and this has been observed by poindexter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and anguita et al .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission is thought to be dominated by inverse compton scattering of uv photons from the disk ( e.g. , reynolds & nowak 2003 ) , some of which is reprocessed into fe  k@xmath8 line emission ( e.g. , george & fabian 1991 ; mushotzky et al .",

    "( 2007 ) used observed x - ray and optical flux ratios for ten four - image lensed quasars to show that the x - ray source is much more strongly microlensed than the optical source , indicating that the x - ray emission region is more compact than the optical .",

    "( 2007 ) result that these sizes , both microlensing and theoretical , are larger than expected given the observed optical flux and the same disk model .",
    "accurate microlensing estimates of the sizes of the x - ray emission regions requires x - ray light curves rather than isolated epochs .",
    "first , the absolute magnifications of lensed images are not well understood because substructure in the lens galaxy can modify the fluxes from the predictions of lens models ( e.g. , mao & schneider 1998 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ) . while comparing optical and x - ray flux ratios",
    "provides estimates for the difference in size between the emission regions , the lack of a secure estimate of the intrinsic flux ratios makes it difficult to set an absolute scale .",
    "second , quasars have intrinsic variability that appears in the images with relative time delays , which means that instantaneous flux ratios are contaminated by the effects of time variability modulated by the delays .",
    "third , while the source size ultimately determines the amplitude of microlensing variability , the instantaneous values are a combination of the source size and the location of the source in the complex microlensing magnification patterns . monitoring the variability minimizes these problems and should lead to far more accurate estimates of the sizes .",

    "the microlenses were given a power - law mass distribution @xmath72 with a dynamic range in mass of a factor of 50 , roughly matching the galactic disk mass function of gould ( 2000 ) , and we use a uniform prior on the mean microlens mass of @xmath73 . we modeled the probability distribution for the physical velocities as in poindexter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) where our projected velocity onto the lens plane is @xmath74  km / s , the velocity dispersion of the lens is @xmath75  km / s based on the critical radius of the mass model , and the lens and source have rms peculiar velocities of @xmath76 and @xmath77  km / s respectively .",
    "the data were then modeled using the bayesian monte carlo method of kochanek ( 2004 ) .",
    "the microlensing data constrains the source velocity and size in `` einstein '' length units of @xmath78  cm .",
    "we can determine the true sizes using the prior on the microlens masses , the prior on the physical velocities or both .",
    "figure 7 shows the probability distribution found for @xmath79 assuming the prior on the physical velocities . while the distribution peaks at somewhat lower mass ( @xmath80 ) than the range of our prior ( @xmath81 to @xmath82 ) , the distribution is so broad ( @xmath83 to @xmath84 at 1-@xmath6 ) that we can view them as statistically consistent .",
    "for example , none of the results depend significantly on the inclusion of the mass prior .",
    "since the mass scales as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the physical velocity from the prior and @xmath87 is the einstein - unit velocity estimated from the microlensing models , it is difficult to tightly constrain the mean mass with a single lens given the unknown peculiar velocities of the lens and source even with perfect knowledge of the einstein - unit velocity .    figure 8 shows the raw estimates of the source sizes @xmath88 in einstein units , where @xmath89 . both of these are scaled source sizes @xmath90 defined by the emission profile presented earlier in this section . the consequence of adding the prior on the microlens masses is to drive the source sizes @xmath88 to be modestly smaller .",
    "in essence , a given level of microlensing variability can be created by a large source moving rapidly ( big @xmath88 and @xmath87 ) or a small source moving more slowly ( small @xmath88 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "but high effective velocities correspond to small mass scales given a fixed physical velocity , so imposing the mass prior given the distribution seen in figure 7 will favor lower velocities @xmath87 and smaller sources @xmath88 .",
    "it will have less effect on the physical source size @xmath89 because the smaller size @xmath88 is balanced by the larger mass scale @xmath91 ( see kochanek 2004 ) . while figure 8 truncates the probability distribution for the x - ray source at the pixel scale of the magnification patterns",
    ", it would not converge to zero if we used magnification patterns with smaller pixel scales to extend the distribution to smaller source sizes .",
    "this is a consequence of not having a well - sampled x - ray light curve .",
    "the source must be small enough to allow the x - ray flux ratio to differ from the optical , but still smaller sources are disfavored because even more discrepant flux ratios become more likely .",
    "however , reducing the size still further has no effect on the probabilities because it converges to the likelihood of the data points avoiding precise caustic crossings .",
    "unfortunately , this does mean that we will obtain robust upper limits on the x - ray source size but not lower limits .",
    "figure 9 shows the results for the rest - frame uv and x - ray source sizes @xmath90 assuming either uniform or logarithmic priors for the size .",
    "we used @xmath90 for both so that the sizes are easily compared .",
    "if we regard the source size at 2000  as measuring a projected area , then @xmath90 scales as @xmath92 for inclination angle @xmath93 of a thin inclined accretion disk .",
    "similarly , the x - ray size in figure 9 should be increased by a factor of @xmath94 to convert from @xmath90 to the half - light radius @xmath95 .",
    "the disk size at 2000  ( @xmath50-band in the rest frame at @xmath96 ) is @xmath97 for a logarithmic prior on the size and @xmath98 for a linear prior on the size .",
    "this agrees well with our earlier estimates in poindexter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and morgan et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "the x - ray size is less certain and more prior - dependent , with an estimated half - light radius @xmath99 for a logarithmic prior on the size and @xmath100 for the linear prior on the size .",
    "we note that the difference in the sizes is entirely driven by the significant differences between the x - ray and optical flux ratios at the time of the x - ray observation .",
    "the microlensing data also prefer lens models with low stellar mass fractions , as shown in figure 10.the probability distribution peaks at @xmath101 , in relatively good agreement with the value of @xmath102 that agrees best with the measured time delay and a hubble constant of @xmath103  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 . while this preliminary result does not lead to a microlensing constraint on @xmath104 that is tight enough to break the degeneracies between the radial mass distribution and the hubble constant ( see kochanek 2002 ) , it is encouraging that there is agreement with the time delays given the expected value of @xmath105 and that the microlensing requires a dark matter - dominated mass distribution .",
    "a detailed microlensing analysis of rx  j1131@xmath01231  that provides similar constraints on the structure of the lens and the structure of the quasar is presented in dai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "figures 11 and 12 show an example of a trial that fits the data well . in this trial",
    "the einstein unit source sizes are @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the x - ray and uv rest - frame sources respectively and the effective velocity corresponds to a sensible microlens mass scale .",
    "we chose this solution mainly because of the curious origin of the initial @xmath50-band peak , where what might be interpreted as a single heavily smoothed caustic crossing is actually a pair of competing caustic crossings in the a and b images , where the a image dominates because of its shallower magnification gradients .",
    "the x - ray epoch then corresponds to time when the source is in a valley between caustics in both images .",
    "we note that this particular solution probably would not reproduce the wavelength dependence of the optical and ir flux ratios in he  1104@xmath01805 discussed and modeled poindexter et al .",
    "while there is a consensus that the origin of the kev x - ray continuum emission from quasars is inverse compton scattering ( e.g. , see the review of reynolds & nowak 2003 ) , the extent and geometric configuration of the emission region is less clear . in the standard disk - corona model ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ; merloni 2003 ) , it is produced in a hot , extended corona surrounding the disk . in the general relativistic mhd simulations of hirose et al .",
    "( 2004 , also machida & matsumoto 2003 ) the region of the corona with the highest current densities lies close to the inner edge of the disk . under the assumption that these are also the regions with the highest dissipation rates for heating the corona ( see hirose et al .",
    "2004 ) , they will dominate the x - ray emission and we would expect the x - ray source size to track the inner edge of the disk .",
    "microlensing of the x - ray source allows us to observationally measure the size of the x - ray emission region .",
    "we start with well - sampled optical light curves that allow us to determine the size of the accretion disk .",
    "morgan et al .",
    "( 2008a ) found a clear scaling of the disk size with black hole mass that is consistent with the @xmath108 scaling of simple thin disk theory for a fixed eddington accretion rate ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we can estimate the disk size by two routes other than microlensing .",
    "first we can estimate it from the observed flux at some wavelength .",
    "size estimates from the observed flux do not depend on the black hole mass but depend only on the assumed temperature profile and the assumption that the disk radiates as a black body at that temperature .",
    "second , thin disk theory predicts the scale length through the expression we presented in the beginning of  3 .",
    "size estimates from thin disk theory depend on the black - hole mass , the eddington factor and the wavelength .",
    "the disk size from our microlensing analysis is roughly consistent with thin disk theory if the accretion efficiency is relatively low , but both the microlensing and theoretical sizes are significantly larger than that estimated from the observed optical flux of the quasar and the same disk model .",
    "this mismatch between the sizes estimated from microlensing and from the flux was first pointed out by pooley et al .",
    "one solution to this problem may be to use a shallower temperature profile than the @xmath109 of simple thin disk theory , and poindexter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found some evidence for a shallower profile in he  1104@xmath01805  by examining the optical / near - ir wavelength dependence of microlensing in this system .",
    "our x - ray monitoring observations of rx  j1131@xmath01231  and he  1104@xmath01805  show significant flux variability in all images of both quasars .",
    "the factor of @xmath110 x - ray flux variability in image a of rx  j1131@xmath01231  is interesting not only because of the high amplitude but also because it is a highly magnified saddle point image .",
    "schechter & wambsganss ( 2002 ) pointed out that in a dark matter dominated galaxy , microlensing is in a regime where images at minima and saddle points of the time - delay surface behave differently . in particular , the saddle point images should show significantly higher variability amplitudes , just as we observe in rx  j1131@xmath01231 .",
    "the relatively large sizes of accretion disks in the optical relative to the typical einstein radius of the stars seems to have masked much of this effect in the optical signatures of microlensing  for example , where the x - ray flux ratio @xmath111 changed by a factor of 4 during our monitoring period , the optical flux ratio changed by only a factor of 1.4 .",
    "the differences between the x - ray and optical flux ratios of he  1104@xmath01805  also imply the presence of x - ray microlensing .",
    "neither system shows evidence for soft x - ray or dust absorption that could explain the differences .",
    "while we measure the source sizes by modeling the data in detail , the essence of the measurement is comparing the amplitude of the x - ray microlensing variability to that in the optical .",
    "if the amplitude for the x - ray microlensing is larger than in the optical , then the x - ray source must be more compact , and this is what we observed in both rx  j1131@xmath01231  and he  1104@xmath01805 . given the estimated black hole mass of @xmath112 ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ) , our fits to the x - ray and optical light curves using the microlensing model described in  2.5 indicate that the x - ray emission in he  1104@xmath01805  comes from a region smaller than @xmath113 and the uv emission region has a size of @xmath114 .",
    "we note that the source sizes of he  1104@xmath01805  were derived using a bayesian analysis which requires a prior .",
    "as shown in figures 8 and 9 our upper limit on the x - ray source size is robust to prior selection but not the lower limit .",
    "obtaining a more precise x - ray size estimate requires a more extensive x - ray light curve for the system .",
    "this is somewhat challenging for he  1104@xmath01805  because the long time delay of he  1104@xmath01805   ( 162 days , morgan et al .",
    "2008a ) and the intrinsic variability we observe here means that this lens requires observations separated by the time delay in order to correct for intrinsic variability .",
    "this is less of a problem for almost all other candidates for x - ray monitoring because they have far shorter time delays .",
    "for example , in rx  j1131@xmath01231  we observe some intrinsic variability but it is significant only on time scales much longer than the delays between the a / b / c images .",
    "given the morgan et al .",
    "( 2008b ) estimates for pg  1115 + 080 , the dai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) results for rx  j1131@xmath01231 , and our present results for he  1104@xmath01805 , the x - ray microlensing results suggest that the size of the x - ray emission arises from close to the inner edge of the disk .",
    "thus , our estimated sizes for the x - ray and uv emission regions place significant constraints on agn models that assume extended coronal envelopes around accretion disks . reducing the uncertainties in these measurements and measuring the scaling of the size with the estimated masses of the black holes",
    "requires longer x - ray time series and more systems , but there is clearly no technical barrier to making the measurements and extending them to the dependence of the size on x - ray energy .",
    "combining the data from the time series also allows us to search for extended emission from groups or clusters near the lens , which can be important for lens models ( e.g. williams et al .",
    "2006 , fassnacht et al .",
    "2007 ) . here",

    "( 2006 ) in more detail , and set limits on the presence of any other clusters near both systems ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "we also used the combined images to search for central or odd images , although this is challenging given the resolution of _ chandra _ and the expected faintness of the images . while we reached 1@xmath6 limits on the flux ratios of @xmath115 , significant constraints on the central images",
