    "nonlinear chaotic systems pose several challenges both for state estimation and for parameter estimation . chaos as a phenomenon implies sensitive dependence on initial condition : initially nearby states will eventually diverge in the future .",
    "the bifurcations of various chaotic systems  @xcite reveal how the behavior of the system differs as a parameter value changes .",
    "one might think that likelihood and bayesian analysis should be able to obtain good estimation both of initial conditions and of parameter values without much trouble .",
    "berliner  @xcite examined the log - likelihood function of estimates of initial conditions and parameter values for the logistic map .",
    "he pointed out that chaotic systems can lead to `` chaotic likelihood functions '' , suggesting that bayesian analysis would require prohibitively intensive computing .",
    "the failure of variational approaches , when applied to long window observations of chaotic systems  @xcite , supports his point .",
    "sensitivity to initial condition also suggests that information in the observations ( even over a relatively short range ) can lead to good estimates of the initial condition  @xcite .",
    "an importance sampling approach for extracting such information without `` intensive computing '' is deployed in this paper . adopting the pseudo - orbit data assimilation ( pda ) approach  @xcite recasts the task into a higher dimensional sequence space , where truly high likelihood states are successfully located near the trajectory manifold .",
    "although statisticians often fail to make a strong distinction between initial conditions and parameter values , the challenges of initial condition estimation and parameter estimation are dissimilar for chaotic systems .",
    "pda does not easily generalize to parameter estimation , as it is unclear how to mathematically define a relevant subspace of parameter space in which high likelihood trajectories might exist .",
    "thus challenges remain in identifying high likelihood parameter values given the initial condition ; this asymmetry is used to discuss differences between the initial conditions and parameter values . in terms of estimating initial conditions given the parameter values ,",
    "however , berliner s challenge is met and resolved without prohibitively intensive computing .",
    "following berliner  @xcite the logistic map is adopted as the system , assuming that the parameter @xmath0 is known but the true initial state @xmath1 is not . in that case , the experiment is said to fall within the perfect model scenario.the evolution of system states @xmath2 is then governed by the nonlinear dynamics @xmath3 , where for the logistic map , the state @xmath4 is a scalar . ]",
    "@xmath5 assuming additive observational noise @xmath6 yields observations , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the true system state ( truth ) and the observational noise , @xmath6 , is independent normally distributed ( ind , @xmath9 ) . under this normality assumption ,",
    "the log - likelihood ( llik ) function is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 iteration of @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the @xmath12 observation , and @xmath15 is the duration of observations considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : lliknormal ] shows the chaotic likelihood structure of 1024 samples from @xmath16 .",
    "panel ( a ) plots the log - likelihood for @xmath17 , this can be contrasted with various panels in berliner  @xcite figure 3 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the log - likelihood ( rllik ) relative to that of the true trajectory of the system states . for the convenience of illustration ,",
    "the same normalization is applied in the following three figures in this paper . from figure",
    "[ fig : lliknormal ] , it is clear that no high likelihood states are identified .",
    "this is not a case of equifinality .",
    "given the observational noise distribution , one can add random draws from the inverse of the observational noise distribution to the observation to obtain candidate estimates of initial condition .",
    "figure  [ fig : llikzoom]a shows the relative log - likelihood of 1024 samples from inverse observational noise .",
    "no high likelihood states are identified in this way . to illustrate the impact of making much more precise observations ,",
    "consider a case where @xmath1 is known to be within a region of radius only @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : llikzoom]b shows the rllik of 1024 uniformly sampled states in the region around the truth with @xmath18 radius . yet again , no high likelihood state are identified .",
    "this difficulty here has nothing to do with the likelihood approaches as there are high likelihood states other than truth .",
    "one may demonstrate that such high likelihood states exist by sampling the points on a logarithmic spiral approaching the truth ( to machine precision ) where @xmath19 is random drawn from @xmath16 . ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : llikblue ] shows that other than truth there exist high likelihood states , i.e. some of the blue points .",
    "a smooth curve of the log - likelihood function is only observed within a radius of @xmath1 smaller than @xmath20 , see figure  [ fig : llikblue]b .    without knowing the truth , of course",
    ", this approach to identifying the blue points is inaccessible .",
    "the likelihood function is extremely jagged ; as berliner  @xcite stressed such chaotic likelihoods suggests that finding even one high likelihood state by sampling the state space would be prohibitively costly , making the approach inapplicable .",
    "that said there is no sense in which `` sensitivity to the initial conditions '' can be taken to imply that the information in the initial condition is `` forgotten '' or  lost \" .",
    "there is sufficient information in the observation segment to identify high likelihood initial states .",
    "candidate states with non vanishing rllik can be found by extracting the information from the system dynamics using a relatively new approach to data assimilation , which will be interpreted as an importance sampling .",
    "to locate high likelihood states , simply sampling in state space is inefficient .",
    "as the dimension of the system increases , this inefficiency makes the task computationally impractical .",
    "importance sampling ( is ) locates high likelihood states in the trajectory manifold by adopting the pseudo - orbit data assimilation approach  @xcite .",

    "the mismatch cost function is then given by : @xmath31 _ pseudo - orbit data assimilation _ minimizes the mismatch cost function for @xmath29 in the @xmath23 dimensional sequence space .",
    "if a gradient descent ( gd ) approach is adopted , then a minimum of the mismatch cost function can be obtained by solving the ordinary differential equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes algorithmic time . a sequence of observations in the system state space define an initial pseudo - orbit , so called _ observation - based pseudo - orbit _ , @xmath34 , which with probability one will not be a trajectory .",
    "in practice , the minimization is initialized with the observation - based pseudo - orbit , i.e. @xmath35 where the pre - super - script @xmath36 on @xmath29 denotes the initial stage of the gd .",
    "the pseudo - orbit is a point in sequence space , under equation  [ eq : odegd ] this point moves towards the manifold of all trajectories .",
    "the mismatch cost function has no local minima other than on the manifold , for which @xmath37 , ( i.e. the trajectory manifold ) and every segment of trajectory lies on this manifold  @xcite . let the result of the gd minimization at time @xmath38 be @xmath39 . here",

    "@xmath41 approaches a trajectory of the model asymptotically .",
    "in other words , the gd minimization takes us from the observation - based pseudo - orbit towards a system trajectory ( a point in sequence space , @xmath42 , which is on the trajectory manifold ) . in practice",
    ", the gd minimization is run for a finite time and thus a trajectory is not obtained .",
    "the result of these large @xmath38 gd runs , @xmath43 provide candidates for the initial state , based on information from the observations with @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , the @xmath46-step preimage of the relevant component of @xmath47 are calculated to obtain additional candidates for the initial state .",
    "the logistic map is a two - to - one map , and in most cases only one of the two preimages for each @xmath47 is relevant to @xmath48 . in practice a criteria to discard irrelevant preimages must be defined , a simple example would be to discard ( with high probability ) those preimages whose distance from the corresponding previous observation exceeds some threshold based on the standard deviation of the observational noise ( a @xmath49 criteria is used to generate the results presented in the following section ) .",
    "the green points in figure  [ fig : llikgreen ] are located using the is approach ; note that some have rllik close to @xmath50 . as expected , the observations do not contain sufficient information to identify the state of the system at the time of the final observation with the same degree of precision .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the green points are much less close to the true state at time @xmath51 ( figure  [ fig : llikgreen]b ) than those at time @xmath50 ( figure  [ fig : llikgreen]a ) .",
    "two experiments were conducted to test the robustness of the is approach .",

    "table  [ tab : lliko ] and table  [ tab : lliks ] shows the results .    given uncertain observations , one can never identify the truth of a chaotic system unambiguously as was noted by lalley  @xcite and later explored by judd and smith  @xcite . using the is approach , high likelihood states (",
    "is states ) are indeed found , as the states whose rllik@xmath54 are found in every single experimental run . the fact that some is states have greater likelihood than the truth supports the expectation that the truth is not expected to be the most likely system state given the observations .    for each experimental run ,",
    "the minimum distance between those is states ( whose rllik@xmath54 ) and the truth is recorded .",
    "the minimum , maximum and median statistical values of the minimum distance from the truth are reported in table  [ tab : lliko ] and [ tab : lliks ] .",
    "it is clear that the quality of the is states improves ( the minimum distance from the truth decreases ) as the observation window length increases .",
    "this is expected inasmuch as more information from the system dynamics becomes available when using a longer window .",
    "it is shown in table  [ tab : lliko ] that the maximum value of the minimum distance among the @xmath52 different realizations is @xmath55 for a window length of 32 and in table  [ tab : lliks ] the maximum value of the minimum distance among different true initial conditions is @xmath56 .",
    "pda importance sampling appears both robust and efficient of truth would require @xmath57 candidates in order to find a candidate within @xmath58 of truth . such a procedure need not identify any high likelihood states .",

    ", the calculation of preimages becomes straightforward .",
    "the experiments above demonstrate that truly high likelihood points can be located using dynamical information .",
    "this eases berliner s identification problem of initial condition with the appearance of chaotic likelihoods . selecting an ensemble from this high likelihood set",
    "allows for informative forecasts which do not become useless until long after those from the point forecasts illustrated by berliner  @xcite become uninformative .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation has been widely used for estimation  @xcite since it was introduced by fisher  @xcite in 1922 .",

    "where it is observed that all traditional candidate states have vanishingly small log - likelihood relative to the expected log - likelihood of the truth , approaches like those suggested above might prove valuable .",
    "statisticians often treat estimating initial conditions and estimating parameter values as similar problems .",
    "although similar behaviors of likelihood functions of initial conditions and that of parameter values are observed  @xcite , there are fundamental differences in the information available to address these two distinct estimation problems .",
    "given the structure of the model class , the model parameter value determines the dynamical behaviour of the model ( e.g. the natural measure ) which is not changed by the initial condition . given the model and its parameter value(s ) , the invariant measure constrains the relevant set(s ) of initial conditions in the state space ( and thereby trajectories in the sequence space ) .",
    "it is unclear how to construct similar constraints ( if they exist ) on the parameter values in the parameter space given the `` true '' initial state .",
    "uncertainty in initial state differs from uncertainty in the parameter value .",
    "the information in a measurement of the initial condition uncertainty will decay with time and eventually becomes statistically indistinguishable from a random sample of the natural measure , while the information on each member from an ensemble under parameter uncertainty is preserved ( and can be straight forwardly extracted given a trajectory segment ) , arguably forever .",
    "while assuming the parameter value is perfect may not be ideal , it is not so nonsensical given that one has already assumed that the model structure is perfect . assuming the initial state is perfect indicates a noise free observation is possible .",

    "if one noise free observation is obtainable , obtaining only a few more noise free observations would define the true parameter value precisely . a more realistic way to put",
    "the problem is to estimate the parameter value(s ) given the observations without assuming the `` true '' initial condition is known or even exists . in that case",

    "unfortunately it is not clear how to solve such a problem .",
    "in fact , it is not clear how to constrain the solution in the parameter space in a manner that reflects the constraints in the space of initial condition achieved by using trajectory manifold in the state space .    given a perfect model structure and knowing the true parameter value(s ) , the true initial state is a well defined goal of the identification . inasmuch as structural model errors imply no true parameter value exists  @xcite , it is unclear how one might define `` true '' initial state and the goal of estimation must be rethought .    despite the importance of model parameters , there is no general method of parameter estimation outside linear systems .",
    "methods have been developed to obtain useful parameter values with some success : mcsharry and smith  @xcite estimate model parameters by incorporating the global behaviour of the model into the selection criteria ; creveling et al .",
    "@xcite have exploited synchronization for parameter estimation ; smith et al .",
    "@xcite focused on the geometric properties of trajectories ; du and smith  @xcite select parameter values based on the ignorance score of ensemble forecasts .",

    "berliner illustrated that even in the perfect model scenario traditional likelihood methods are unable to provide good estimates of the initial condition for nonlinear chaotic systems .",
    "in large part , the failure is due to the inability of those approaches to skillfully meld the information in the dynamics of the nonlinear system itself with that in the observations .",
