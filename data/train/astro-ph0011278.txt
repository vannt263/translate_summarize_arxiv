    "spiral galaxies typically contain magnetic fields with strength of about @xmath2 g that are aligned with the spiral density waves @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation is that these fields have been produced via a galactic dynamo mechanism , in which a weak seed field was amplified by the differential rotation of the galaxy in conjunction with magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the required strength of the seed field is subject to large uncertainties ; for a flat , critical - density universe , estimates lie in the range @xmath3@xmath4 g at the time of completed galaxy formation .",
    "this lower bound can be relaxed @xcite to about @xmath5 g for a universe with a dark - energy component ( e.g. a cosmological constant or quintessence ) , which appears to be favoured by recent results from supernova observations and balloon experiments . for the dynamo to work",
    ", the galactic seed field should be correlated on a scale of @xmath6 pc , corresponding to the largest turbulent eddy . because the magnetic field strength @xmath7 and correlation length @xmath1 scale as @xmath8 during the collapse of matter into a galaxy , where @xmath9 is the matter density , the required comoving correlation length is @xmath10 kpc @xcite . on this scale ,",
    "the lower bounds for the seed field are @xmath11 g for a critical - density universe , and @xmath12 g for a flat , dark - energy dominated , low - density universe .",
    "many proposals have been put forward regarding the origin of the seed field @xcite . among the most interesting",
    "is the possibility that the field is primordial and was generated in the early universe through one of several field - theoretic mechanisms that occur in models of particle physics .",
    "such a mechanism must occur out of equilibrium , which limits the choice to either inflation or a phase transition . in phase transitions , however , it is difficult to explain the large correlation length .",
    "for instance , the comoving scale corresponding to the _ horizon _ at any time before the last ( qcd ) phase transition is much smaller than 10 kpc , so the seed field is unlikely to have been produced by _",
    "causal _ processes in a phase transition in the early universe .",
    "inflationary models solve problems with causality ( such as the horizon problem ) by stretching space itself , without changing the speed of light rays relative to a local , inertial frame .",
    "for example , it is well known that long - wavelength vacuum fluctuations of scalar fields grow during inflation and provide the seeds for large - scale structure in the form of density perturbations @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", one might expect inflation to be able to produce magnetic fields correlated on scales that are beyond causality bounds .",
    "in a conformal metric @xmath13 $ ] ( which characterises de sitter inflation and flat frw eras ) , gauge fields @xmath14 are conformally invariant and do not couple gravitationally .",
    "in fact , the equation of motion can be reduced to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the minkowski - space dalembertian .",
    "this equation has only harmonic solutions , and thus the amplitude of vacuum fluctuations of @xmath14 is a constant function of ( conformal ) time @xmath17 .    in order to have a changing amplitude of vacuum fluctuations",
    ", one must somehow break conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "a simple way would be to add , by hand , a mass term @xmath18 to the lagrangian .",
    "this gives rise to the following equation for a ( transverse ) fourier mode @xmath19 : @xmath20 where we have used that the scale factor @xmath21 in de  sitter inflation with hubble parameter @xmath22 .",
    "it is obvious that the addition of such a positive mass term will not lead to growth in the amplitude @xmath23 ; on the contrary , the amplitude of long - wavelength vacuum fluctuations decreases during inflation . to see this in detail ,",
    "we investigate the exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ modeeq ] ) , which are @xmath24 where @xmath25 are hankel functions . towards the beginning of inflation ( @xmath26 )",
    ", the solutions behave as @xmath27 [ up to a phase ] such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 . at the end of inflation , which in our parametrisation occurs at @xmath30",
    ", we have for long wavelengths ( @xmath31 ) that @xmath32 and @xmath33 . because @xmath34 , the amplitude has decreased .",
    "note , however , that the electric - field amplitude @xmath35 has increased enormously for very long wavelengths @xmath36 .",
    "this is a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "we shall see next how such a large electric field is converted into a magnetic field when the mass @xmath37 suddenly drops to zero at the end of inflation .",
    "in order to understand the concept of non - adiabaticity , consider a quantum particle in the ground state of a one - dimensional infinite well . if the walls of the well are suddenly moved apart (",
    "so quickly that the particle has no time to exchange energy with its surroundings ) , the particle will find itself in a quantum state which is , in general , a linear superposition of excited states of the new , larger well . in the case of a quantum field",
    ", such an excited state corresponds to a physical observable field , distinct from the vacuum . in our scenario @xcite , we propose that the photon mass @xmath37 goes non - adiabatically to zero at the end of inflation , so that the massive - photon mode functions described by eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) are suddenly projected onto mode functions @xmath38 that are solutions of the massless equation . in the quantum language , this can be expressed as a bogoliubov transformation @xmath39 between annihilation operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the quantum fields with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are found by matching the quantum field and its time derivative at the transition . through this matching ,",
    "the large time derivative of the massive mode is converted into a large amplitude of the massless mode .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath45 indicates particle creation . in our case ,",
    "@xmath46 for @xmath36 , showing that long - wavelength modes are created with large amplitude .",
    "this occurs also if @xmath37 goes to zero smoothly @xcite , provided that it does so non - adiabatically , i.e.@xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "let us now consider several models which exhibit this behaviour @xcite .",
    "first , consider inflation with two scalar fields , @xmath49 real and @xmath50 complex , where @xmath50 couples minimally to the photon field @xmath14 , giving it a mass @xmath51 .",
    "the potential is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an increasing function . during inflation ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath54 decrease as they roll along the curve @xmath55 until @xmath56 , after which @xmath57 . in order for our mechanism to be efficient ,",
    "we require @xmath58 and thus @xmath59 .",
    "such values arise naturally in supergravity models , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the second possibility is through the back reaction of the vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field , @xmath62 , on the equation of motion of a minimally coupled gauge field .",
    "we know that @xmath62 grows during inflation , and thus would give a mass @xmath63 to the photon .",
    "the mass goes to zero if @xmath64 decays soon after the end of inflation , which would be the case if @xmath64 is , e.g. , a heavy squark field , or if @xmath64 is the electroweak higgs field and the electroweak symmetry is restored by reheating . in the latter case , the electroweak @xmath65 field would play the role of the gauge field .",
    "there is some controversy about this ; in a different talk at this conference , shaposhnikov argues that the effective transverse ( so - called magnetic ) mass of the gauge field is zero both during inflation and after inflation .",
    "however , when a quantum operator evolves non - adiabatically , one should employ out - of - equilibrium methods to calculate its expectation value , and there is no reason that it should be zero .",
    "all these mechanisms result in a gauge - field spectrum @xmath66 , corresponding to a magnetic field @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is the relevant coherence scale and @xmath68 .",
    "this spectrum is displayed below .",
    "pairs of parallel lines indicate spectra with and without amplification by a factor @xmath69 during preheating .",
    "we see that the lower bounds for the dynamo seed field can be met with our mechanism .",
