    "<S> we introduce a tomography approach to describe the optical response of a cavity quantum electrodynamics device , beyond the semiclassical image of polarization rotation , by analyzing the polarization density matrix of the reflected photons in the poincar sphere . applying this approach to an electrically - controlled quantum dot - cavity device </S>",

    "<S> , the output photonic field includes a contribution from the resonance fluorescence emitted by the natural or artificial atom , which can be partially incoherent with respect to the incoming laser @xcite . in quantum optics this is described by an output field operator @xmath2 which can not be reduced to its expectation value @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent contribution is governed by the average field @xmath4 , which keeps a defined phase with respect to the incoming field ; the incoherent component , however , arises from quantum fluctuations around the average field , and has no specific phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a direct consequence of this is that the optical response of a device can not , in general , be solely described by a reflection coefficient with a well - defined amplitude and phase . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a general output polarization is not necessarily a pure polarization state .    </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between coherent and incoherent responses is especially important in solid - state quantum technologies , where artificial atoms , such as semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , interact with a fluctuating environment . </S>",

    "<S> a peak in @xmath46 is observed at @xmath34 , indicating that up to 7@xmath1 of the incident light has been reconverted by the quantum dot into @xmath13-polarized resonance fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14-polarized output intensity also presents a peak at @xmath31 , though superposed to the broader reflectivity dip of the @xmath14-polarized cavity mode . </S>",

    "<S> the high qd - induced peak is thus related to the @xmath14-polarized resonance fluorescence , emitted by the @xmath20 exciton , which is large enough to strongly change the amount of intracavity light , and thus the resulting output field .    to perform a complete polarization tomography we now analyse our device in the other two bases . by adjusting the waveplates of the polarization analyzer introduced in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , however , the incoherent resonance fluorescence emitted by the quantum dot modifies this situation . </S>",
    "<S> as displayed in figs  [ fig : fig4](b - d ) , the exact calculation predicts a significant degradation of the polarization purity at increasing powers . at higher powers </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot transition becomes saturated and the polarization purity is restored , as would be the case with an empty cavity . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b - d ) we note the strong discrepancy between the exact calculation and the semiclassical approximation , which only predicts coherent outputs and , thus , pure polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> the semiclassical image should thus , by no means , be considered as a complete description of the optical response for a cqed device ; it can be fruitfully used , however , in the absence of pure dephasing and for experiments in the low - excitation regime .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , polarization tomography allows probing the optical response of a cqed device beyond the semiclassical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the superposition of @xmath13-polarized single photons with a @xmath14-polarized reflected field can be partially coherent , leading to a polarization rotation whose degree of purity can be decreased by dephasing processes . the tomography approach will provide a comprehensive measurement tool for polarization - encoded protocols : in particular , a single electron spin described in the bloch sphere can be monitored by , or entangled with , a photon polarization qubit described in the poincar sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this would constitute the heart of future quantum networks , where cqed devices interact by exchanging polarization - encoded photonic qubits @xcite .    </S>",
