    "to begin , we outline the typical approach to deriving hubbard models for ultracold atoms with mass @xmath0 in an optical lattice . for simplicity we assume the atoms to be spinless bosons ; extensions to fermionic atoms , multi - component gases including bose - fermi mixtures with different lattice potentials , atom - molecular interactions and finite - range interactions are straightforward @xcite .",
    "standing waves of laser light , tuned out of resonance , exert a spatially - periodic ac stark shift on the ground internal state of the bosons .",
    "for sufficiently low atom energies and densities @xmath1 the interactions between the atoms are well - approximated by a contact interaction of strength @xmath2 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then of the form @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4 annihilates a boson of mass @xmath0 and the single - particle hamiltonian is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lattice potential induced by the ac stark shift .",
    "we expand the field operators in terms of a complete basis of orthonormal mode functions @xmath7 , corresponding to single - particle states @xmath8 obeying the translational equivalence @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a direct lattice vector for which @xmath11 is satisfied , and which indicates the lattice site where @xmath12 is localized , relative to some origin .",
    "the integer @xmath13 is commonly called the band number , although as we shall see shortly it will index modes which may comprise of mixtures of several bands .",
    "an atom occupying the mode @xmath12 is often said to be in the @xmath13-th excited state or mode of lattice site @xmath10 .",
    "the expansion thus takes the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 annihilates a boson in mode @xmath12 , such that the hamiltonian @xmath16 may be re - expressed as @xmath17 with hopping and interaction parameters @xmath18 due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : translation ] ) , these parameters are invariant under a simultaneous translation in the direct lattice vectors that label them .",
    "the hamiltonian simplifies in two ways .",
    "first , for sufficiently small kinetic @xmath19 and interaction energies @xmath20 , we can ignore all but some number @xmath21 of the bands .",
    "second , @xmath22 are chosen such that they are well localized , meaning that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to hopping or interaction between distant states are negligible . this leaves the hubbard model @xmath25 where the angular brackets indicate that the sum is restricted to local terms , e.g. , same - site , nearest - neighbor , or next - nearest - neighbor etc .",
    "the range of the terms that need to be kept will depend on how local the @xmath12 can be , which in turn is dependent on the form of the potential @xmath6 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the choice of wavefunctions @xmath12 used in the above procedure .",
    "a complete basis of orthonormal functions is provided by the bloch states @xmath26 , corresponding to eigenfunctions of @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 are cell - periodic functions  @xcite .",
    "the bloch states of a given band @xmath30 are uniquely labeled by a wave - vector @xmath31 that runs over the first brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "any band @xmath30 with energies @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 for all @xmath31 will not contribute to the physics and may be ignored .",
    "for all optical lattice potentials we consider here it is possible to focus solely on a small number @xmath21 of the lowest - energy bands which may be degenerate amongst themselves but are separated in energy from the others .    to describe local interactions within this @xmath21-band subspace , a good choice of basis are states of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume of the primitive cell of the @xmath36-dimensional direct lattice , and @xmath37 is a unitary matrix that mixes the bloch bands . in the case that @xmath37 is diagonal , i.e.",
    ", there is no band mixing , these states are exactly those first considered by wannier  @xcite . thus the states appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wannier_generalized ] ) are commonly referred to as generalized wannier states .",
    "the separation in energy of the @xmath21 lowest bands from the others ensures that some states @xmath38 exist with mode functions @xmath12 that are exponentially localized at lattice site @xmath10 in coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "this exponential localization occurs if and only if the bloch superpositions @xmath39 are analytic ( infinitely differentiable ) in @xmath31 across the whole brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "this is a rigorous way of saying that only smoothed - out bloch superpositions will lead to localization when fourier transformed .",
    "when there are no degeneracies between bands can one simply use the phases of elements of a diagonal @xmath37 ( representing the freedom in the phase of each @xmath26 ) to ensure the smoothness of the bloch states @xmath40 .",
    "hence simple wannier states provide an exponentially localized basis in such cases .",
    "however , this is no longer the case when degeneracies and crossings in the band structure lead to non - analytic @xmath26 .",
    "in this situation band mixing and therefore a non - diagonal @xmath37 are required to obtain smooth bloch superpositions and an exponentially - localized basis .",
    "the ` only if ' case highlights the importance of the generalization of wannier states to include non - diagonal @xmath37 .",
    "even when exponential localization is possible using simple wannier states , generalized wannier states may still significantly improve the localization .",
    "we will give examples of this in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "generalized wannier states therefore have the potential to provide a well - localized basis for the derivation of a hubbard model .",
    "however , generalized wannier states are highly non - unique and so it remains to find and choose a single exponentially - localized basis .",
    "several criteria have been proposed as a means of selecting a specific basis of generalized wannier states  @xcite . here , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we seek the generalized wannier states with a minimal combined spatial variance , henceforth called spread , defined as @xmath41 \\nonumber\\\\ = & \\sum_{n=1}^{j }    \\left [   \\langle { \\mathbf{r}}^2 \\rangle_n - \\bar{{\\mathbf{r}}}_n^2 \\right ] = \\sum_{n=1}^{j } \\omega^n .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the minimizing states are called the maximally - localized generalized wannier states .",
    "it is known that the maximally - localized generalized wannier states are indeed exponentially localized  @xcite .",
    "they do not necessarily provide the optimal approximation to @xmath16 when restricting the number of terms kept in @xmath42 but can be expected to be close to optimal . finding a set of generalized wannier states which makes the hubbard model approximation optimal is challenging . hence minimizing the spread of the generalized wannier functions",
    "is both an effective and practical choice with the added benefit of having a straightforward interpretation in terms of a particle occupying a specific lattice site .",
    "note that it has been hypothesized that the maximally - localized generalized wannier states always correspond to real functions , up to a global phase , when dealing with an isolated group of @xmath21 bands  @xcite .",
    "all of our calculations support this hypothesis .",
    "to obtain maximally localized wannier states we must first calculate the band structure @xmath43 and bloch states @xmath26 .",
    "such calculations are well - understood and we include our procedure here only for completeness and to introduce notation required later",
    ". then we must find the gauge @xmath37 such that the resulting generalized wannier states @xmath38 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wannier_generalized ] ) , minimize the spread , defined by eq .",
    "( [ spread_total ] ) .",
    "this usually consists of several steps : initially , we choose the gauge @xmath44 to be the @xmath45 identity matrix . then the gauge is transformed iteratively @xmath46 according to a unitary @xmath47 .",
    "these transformations accumulate until they converge to the desired gauge @xmath37 , corresponding to the minimum spread . from this",
    ", the maximally - localized generalized wannier states may be calculated together with the hopping and interaction parameters .",
    "in the strategy devised by mazari and vanderbilt  @xcite an initial unitary @xmath47 is constructed via projections of @xmath21 localized trial orbitals onto the bloch states .",
    "this transformation leads to a gauge @xmath48 corresponding to an analytic set of bloch superpositions @xmath40 and thus exponentially - localized generalized wannier states @xmath38 .",
    "subsequently , other unitary transformations @xmath47 are iteratively applied as part of a steepest - descent algorithm , in the hope that the cumulative gauge @xmath37 converges towards the spread - minimizing gauge .",
    "unfortunately when applying this strategy to investigate common optical - lattice potentials , we found that the gauge corresponding to the maximally - localized generalized wannier states is rarely obtained .",
    "instead the spread often converges to some non - global minimum",
    ". therefore we adopt a different initialization procedure , to precede the same steepest - descent algorithm .",
    "contrastingly , we find that , for the optical - lattice potentials considered , our strategy converges quite consistently to the global minimum , and thus the maximally - localized generalized wannier states are reliably obtained . while proving convergence to the global minimum is difficult , we test numerically both that the same solution is found when starting from two bloch states differing by random permutations of the bands at each @xmath31 , and that the final generalized wannier states are real .    in this section",
    "we begin by outlining the band structure calculation , and the representation of quantities , such as the spread , in reciprocal space .",
    "we then briefly describe mazari and vanderbilt s steepest - descent algorithm , before outlining two methods we will use as our initialization procedure . to end the section ,",
    "we describe our full procedure for calculating the maximally - localized generalized wannier states .",
    "( a ) the reciprocal lattice points for a two - dimensional oblique lattice .",
    "the black circle has a radius of @xmath49 and is centered on @xmath50 .",
    "fourier components corresponding to reciprocal lattice points within the circle ( red points ) are included in the truncated basis set , while those outside ( blue points ) are not .",
    "( b ) a mesh of wave - vectors @xmath31 for a hexagonal two - dimensional lattice used to interpolate values of functions of @xmath31 over the brillouin zone , which is shown by the black hexagon .",
    ", width=321 ]    we work with the fourier space representation of the potential and cell - periodic functions @xmath51 where the integral is over a primitive cell of the direct lattice . in this representation the single - particle schrdinger equation @xmath52 may be written as @xmath53 the full band structure is obtained by solving this equation for all wave - vectors @xmath54 in the brillouin zone and all reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath55  @xcite .    to make this calculation tractable on a computer , we firstly truncate the fourier expansions to include some finite number @xmath56 of terms ,",
    "corresponding to reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath55 with magnitudes @xmath57 less than @xmath49 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k - mesh](a ) .",
    "then we only solve eq .",
    "( [ coeff_eqn ] ) for a @xmath36-dimensional uniform discrete mesh of @xmath58 wave - vectors @xmath59 contained within some primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice , and interpolate between these wave - vectors .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k - mesh](b ) , this primitive cell need not be the first brillouin zone since the corresponding bloch states are invariant when translated by a reciprocal lattice vector into the brillouin zone . for each @xmath31 in the mesh , solving the set of eqs .",
    "( [ coeff_eqn ] ) then reduces to an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the justification of the truncation and mesh discretization , as well as the values of @xmath49 and @xmath60 we use are discussed in appendix  [ sec : discretization ] .    note that various symmetries guarantee certain properties of the coefficients @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "for a given @xmath30 and @xmath31 , time - reversal symmetry implies that we may choose @xmath62 .",
    "the addition of inversion symmetry allows us to set @xmath63 and @xmath64 as real up to a common phase factor and ensures @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that , when both symmetries are present , we may both reduce our mesh of reciprocal lattice vectors by nearly half , as the coefficients for @xmath66 may be inferred from those for @xmath55 , and restrict all quantities in the eigenvalue equation ( [ coeff_eqn ] ) to be real , thus speeding up computations for each @xmath31 .",
    "following mazari and vanderbilt , the spread @xmath67 can be conveniently decomposed into two positive definite parts , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the latter depends on the choice of gauge @xmath37 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wannier_generalized ] ) , while the former does not .",
    "the gauge - independent part @xmath68 depends only on the smoothness in @xmath31-space of the underlying manifold of bloch states , while the gauge - dependent part @xmath69 depends on the additional smoothing achieved by applying phases to and mixing the bloch states . in preparation for what follows , it is useful to further decompose @xmath70 and @xmath71 into band - diagonal and band - off - diagonal terms . for the diagonal terms",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 it makes sense to break them down into positive - definite contributions from each band .",
    "the decomposition is expressed neatly as @xmath74 our minimization method will of course leave @xmath75 invariant , while minimizing @xmath69 .",
    "the mazari and vanderbilt steepest - descent algorithm iteratively minimizes @xmath69 directly , while our initialization procedure is divided into two stages , one which reduces @xmath76 and another which minimizes @xmath77 .    in terms of generalized wannier states , the contributions to the spread",
    "are written    [ eq : spread_realspace ] @xmath78    again , for computational tractability , we move to the truncated fourier representation with a discretized mesh . in this , all integrals over the brillouin zone are replaced by summations over the mesh , @xmath79 and gradients represented by finite differences ( the gradients in reciprocal space arise from moments in position space ) .",
    "we use the finite - difference expressions recommended by marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite , which have the property of transforming correctly under translations of the generalized wannier states by a direct lattice vector . in this way",
    ", contributions to the spread are re - expressed as    [ eq : spread_kspace ] @xmath80 + \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\overline{\\mathbf{r}}_n \\right)^2 , \\label{eq : spread_d_kspace } \\\\",

    "these elements are initialized to @xmath90 when @xmath44 . then under a gauge transformation @xmath91",
    "they undergo the computationally simple transformation @xmath92 .",
    "the gradient @xmath93 , embodying the change in spread due to a gauge transformation @xmath94 , with @xmath95 an infinitesimal anti - hermitian matrix , can be efficiently calculated from the matrices @xmath96 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . the steepest - descent approach , as used in refs .",
    "@xcite , then implements the gauge transformation @xmath94 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 a small positive number .",
    "these steps are repeated until convergence is achieved .    to a large extent ,",
    "the steepest - descent algorithm is only as good as its initialization procedure , since starting from an arbitrary set of generalized wannier states , the algorithm is likely to drive the set towards one of the many local minima in the spread , rather than the global minimum .",
    "we do not discuss here the commonly used projection - based initialization procedure ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for information on this ) that we found to struggle for optical - lattice potentials .",
    "instead we now discuss two other approaches for reducing the spread , which together will form the initialization procedure we use successfully for optical - lattice potentials .",
    "we break down the task of finding the maximally - localized wannier states into two stages .",
    "the first stage is to mix the bands to create a new set of pseudo - bands from which a maximally - localized ordinary wannier states calculation is optimal ( i.e.  leading to the smallest possible spread ) .",
    "the second stage is to calculate the maximally - localized ordinary wannier states using these pre - mixed bands as a starting point .",
    "the first stage corresponds to minimizing the off - diagonal term @xmath76 , and the second to minimizing the diagonal term @xmath77 .",
    "our initialization procedure is split accordingly : first we reduce ( but not necessarily minimize ) @xmath76 , as described in this subsection ; second we minimize @xmath77 , as described in the next subsection .    our first goal is then to reduce the band - off - diagonal term @xmath76 , which is equivalent to reducing @xmath99 .",
    "this equivalence is clear from the interpretation above , that reducing @xmath76 corresponds to optimizing the bands from which to perform a maximally - localized ordinary wannier states calculation .",
    "mathematically , it follows from observing that the band - off - diagonal parts of the gauge - invariant spread @xmath68 and the gauge - dependent spread @xmath69 are the negative of each other ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spread_realspace]b ) , ( [ eq : spread_realspace]d ) and ( [ eq : spread_kspace]b ) , ( [ eq : spread_kspace]d ) ) : reducing @xmath76 is achieved by increasing the band - off - diagonal part @xmath100 of the gauge - invariant spread or , equivalently , reducing its diagonal part @xmath99 .    to reduce @xmath99",
    ", we use a method devised by souza , mazari and vanderbilt  @xcite . for @xmath101 degenerate bands ,",
    "their minimizes the contributions to @xmath68 from a subset @xmath102 bands obtained through a unitary mixing of these bands .",
    "the aim of this approach is then to construct the @xmath103 bands with the smoothest @xmath31-space such that they provide the optimal set of @xmath103 bands from which to construct localized generalized wannier states ( optimal in the sense of having the smallest possible gauge - invariant contribution to the spread ) .",
    "we use their approach to reduce @xmath99 in the following way : first , we use the souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "method to minimize @xmath104 and therefore construct , from the @xmath105 bands , a single ( @xmath106 ) band whose smoothness in @xmath31-space is optimum for constructing a localized wannier state .",
    "then , keeping this band fixed , we use the souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "method again to minimize @xmath107 and construct from the @xmath108 remaining bands a single ( @xmath109 ) band that is optimum for constructing a localized wannier state .",
    "this is repeated in a similar fashion to obtain a third , fourth , etc .",
    "band until finally we use the souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "method to minimize @xmath110 and construct an optimized @xmath111-th band out of the two remaining bands , with all lower bands fixed .",
    "our approach therefore consists of @xmath112 applications of the souza _",
    "_  method , in each case optimally extracting a single ( @xmath106 ) band from @xmath113 others .",
    "note that this does not necessarily minimize @xmath99 and therefore @xmath76 , but we find that following this procedure @xmath76 is very small .",
    "details of the souza _",
    "_  method and our use of it can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix  [ app : our_algorithm ] , respectively . here",
    "we simply note that the souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "method proceeds via several iterations , each of which applies a transformation @xmath47 over all @xmath31-space that would have minimized the contribution to the spread from any given point in @xmath31-space had there been no transformation applied at the other points in @xmath31-space .",
    "the desired gauge must be left unchanged by such an iteration and thus it is a possible point of convergence . to protect against false convergences , we initialize the whole procedure above by applying a transformation @xmath114 , where at each @xmath82 we take a @xmath45 identity matrix and randomly permute its rows .",
    "we find that in practice , following this initialization , the desired gauge is nearly always obtained .",
    "we next present a method that reduces the intra - band contribution @xmath77 to the spread , while leaving the inter - band contribution @xmath76 invariant . to ensure this invariance , in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to gauge transformations @xmath47 that are diagonal , i.e. , while we allow changes to the phases of the bloch superpositions @xmath40 , we do not allow any transformations that further mix the bands .",
    "hence the task splits into @xmath21 independent parts , each to reduce @xmath115 by applying phases to the bloch superpositions @xmath40 .",
    "one may interpret this as constructing the maximally - localized ordinary wannier states from a set of bands comprising the mixed bloch states @xmath40 .",
    "such single - band tasks are usually described in terms of the berry connection @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "integrals ( berry phases @xmath117 ) of the berry connection around closed paths @xmath118 in the brillouin zone are invariant under changes to the phases of the bloch states @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that @xmath119 , equal to the average value of @xmath120 across the brillouin zone , is also invariant  @xcite .",
    "a further invariant quantity is given by @xmath121 , called the berry curvature .",
    "local values of @xmath120 , however , depend on the phases of the bloch states , which determine the phase - dependent part of the spread @xmath115 . it is known that this spread is minimized when the divergence of the connection vanishes , @xmath122 , and the minimum possible spread depends only on the berry curvature @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath124 , then the minimum possible spread @xmath115 is zero .",
    "it follows that all berry phases are zero and it is possible to smooth @xmath120 such that it is uniform , at which point @xmath125 . to smooth the connection @xmath120",
    ", we use a progressive phase update method : it consists of taking a succession of closed loops through the brillouin zone , and , for each , altering the bloch phases at points along the loop such that the projections of @xmath120 along it are constant .",
    "this constant value is fixed by their integral around the loop , the berry phase , which is invariant .",
    "adjusting the phases in this way for several loops , given in appendix  [ app : our_algorithm2 ] , will result in a flattened connection , if possible .    for non - zero @xmath123 , absolute uniformity of the connection",
    "@xmath120 is not possible .",
    "however , in an attempt to suppress the divergence of the connection and therefore approach the minimum spread @xmath115 , we still choose to smooth out @xmath120 using the progressive phase update method and find this greatly reduces @xmath115 . to achieve the minimum , we follow the progressive phase updates with the steepest - descent minimization algorithm of marzari and vanderbilt ( cf . sec .  [ sec : steepest_descent ] ) , when only terms corresponding to @xmath115 contribute to the gradient @xmath126 .",
    "a particular case of interest is a system with inversion symmetry and a current gauge @xmath37 that is diagonal , i.e. , the bands have not been mixed . as a result of the symmetry",
    ", the mode functions @xmath127 must be real up to a global phase , at which point the berry curvature and thus the spread @xmath115 vanishes .",
    "note that optical - lattice potentials usually possess inversion symmetry since this is inherited from the lasers that created them ; superlattice techniques are required to break this .",
    "we found that even if @xmath37 is not diagonal , e.g. , after the inter - band spread is reduced , the output of the disentangling procedure often still had zero berry curvature for each band and the progressive phase update method reduced @xmath115 to zero .",
    "specifically , this occurred whenever the degeneracies in our @xmath21-band subspace were a result of purely geometric symmetries .",
    "we hypothesize this is a general feature , also hinted at in the results of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "having described the elements of our computational approach , we now describe how they are pieced together .",
    "the full procedure for calculating the maximally - localized generalized wannier states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannier - flow - diagram ] .",
    "first we calculate the band structure",
    ". then we minimize the intra - band spread via a progressive phase update , followed by a restricted version of the steepest - descent method ( for potentials with inversion symmetry , the steepest - descent part is unnecessary ) . at this point we are at the gauge corresponding to the maximally - localized ordinary wannier states .",
    "we then reduce the inter - band spread using the method adapted from souza _ et al . _",
    "the inter - band spread reduction usually has the side - effect of increasing the intra - band spread slightly , so we again apply a progressive phase update , followed by the restricted version of the steepest - descent method to minimize the intra - band spread .",
    "the above forms our initialization procedure .",
    "if this has not already found the global minimum of spread , we find that it is sufficiently close that the full steepest - descent algorithm  @xcite returns the maximally - localized generalized wannier states with a close to perfect success rate .    .",
    "second , it minimizes @xmath115 for each band as far as possible without mixing the bands .",
    "third , it reduces @xmath76 .",
    "fourth , it again minimizes @xmath115 for each band as far as possible without further mixing the bands .",
    "fifth , it minimizes the total @xmath128 to its global minimum via steepest - descent minimization .",
    "last , we compute the hubbard parameters and construct the maximally localized generalized wannier states.,width=321 ]",
    "we next use the above procedure to derive _ ab initio _ the hubbard hamiltonians realized by bosons in a variety of optical - lattice potentials .",
    "the reasons are four - fold .",
    "first , we test the accuracy of our procedure .",
    "second , we compare the procedure against others , e.g. , methods using ordinary rather than generalized wannier states .",
    "third , we demonstrate that local hubbard hamiltonians can be justified for several experimentally - important cold - atom optical - lattice systems .",
    "fourth , we provide the relevant model parameters accurately in terms of well known control parameters like the laser intensity .    for the testing",
    ", we use the hopping parameters from our derived hubbard hamiltonian to calculate an interpolated band - structure according to the tight - binding model . the legitimacy of our approximations",
    "can then be considered by comparing the interpolated band - structure to the original .",
    "note that this only allows us to determine the accuracy of the hopping parameters , not the interaction terms . since we are unable to directly verify the accuracy of discarding interaction parameters ,",
    "we only discard those of magnitude equal to , or less than , that of the discarded hopping parameters for some typical range of interaction strengths @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the recoil energy , and @xmath131 is the ` averaged ' wavelength of the laser beams creating the optical lattice  .",

    "<S> [ sec : problem ] we discuss the derivation of hubbard models for cold atoms in optical lattices , introducing generalized wannier states as a basis for this derivation and outlining the problem of finding the states with minimum combined spread . </S>",
    "<S> our approach for obtaining the maximally - localized basis is then described in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : methods ] . </S>",
    "<S> we include an outline of marzari and vanderbilt s steepest - descent algorithm , discuss the steps of our initialization procedure and then summarize how we combine these elements . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : results ] we derive hubbard models for bosons in several optical - lattice potentials , first in one dimension then in two , verifying the accuracy of our calculations on each occasion . finally , we conclude in sec .  [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : conclusions ] before presenting computational details in the appendices . </S>"
