    "unconventional superconductors are one of the most important materials in the modern condensed matter physics , as a key to understanding strong electron correlation effect . a number of superconductors , high - t@xmath3 cuprates , heavy - fermion metals , ruthenates , and organic compounds exhibit unconventionality in the sense that the superconducting gap vanishes somewhere on the fermi surface , resulting in power - law behaviors in various thermodynamic quantities . however , while many superconductors were found unconventional , detailed gap structures are still unexplored except for the cuprates .",
    "one of the difficulties in clarifying the gap structures seem to lie in the lack of experimental probes sensitive to quasiparticle momentum distribution .",
    "recently the vortex states have been attracting much interest , because the positions of gap nodes can be detected . when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the superconducting plane(ab - plane )",
    ", various physical quantities depend on the angle between the magnetic field and the superconducting gap nodes .",
    "hence , by rotating the field within the plane and tracing the change of physical quantities , one can obtain the information of the gap nodes .",
    "so far , thermal conductivity@xcite and specific heat@xcite have been measured in the vortex state for a number of layered unconventional superconductors including sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2@xcite , cecoin@xmath4@xcite , @xmath5(et)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1@xcite , yni@xmath1b@xmath1c@xcite and pros@xmath2sb@xmath6@xcite .",
    "however , it is found that some of these experiments show the behaviors incompatible with the results of theoretical analyses .",
    "for example , microscopic calculations show an existence of vertical line nodes in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2@xcite , while the experiments suggest line nodes run horizontally@xcite .",
    "probably these discrepancies are attributed to the lack of firm theoretical basis in analyzing the experimental data . actually , experimental data have been interpreted based on a phenomenological doppler - shift method , which has been claimed to be quite unreliable in some cases@xcite .",
    "so far , there have been few microscopic analyses on quasiparticle states under a magnetic field parallel to the ab - plane . in particular , no microscopic analysis has been done on layered unconventional superconductors .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to establish a reliable theory in these systems , and give a correct interpretation of the experiments .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of quasiparticle density of states in a layered superconductor under a magnetic field .",
    "we will focus on sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , in which positions of the line nodes are still controversial . a cylindrical fermi surface with vertical line nodes of f - wave symmetry is assumed , and a magnetic field is applied parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "we concentrate on the two cases where a magnetic field is in the nodal direction , and in the antinodal direction .",
    "we investigate the low - energy quasiparticle states , and apply the results to the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "our analysis is based on the microscopic bogoliubov de gennes equation and an approximate analytical method invented by pesch and recently developped by dahm .    in the next section",
    ", calculational formulation is described . in section [ secre ]",
    ", we will show our results and discussion on the experiments .",
    "section [ seccon ] contains conclusion .",
    "first , we introduce some general features of our model . we study a quasi - two - dimensional layered superconductor which has a cylindrical fermi surface with small c - axis dispersion .",
    "thus we assume a dispersion relation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the momentum in the ab - plane and the c - axis wave number _",
    "k_@xmath9 varies in the interval [ @xmath10 . in this system",
    ", the fermi velocity can be written in the following form , @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . here , the azimuthal angle @xmath14 varies between [ 0,@xmath15 .",
    "the c - axis dispersion @xmath16 exists due to a small inter - layer hopping .    in this paper , we consider a spin - triplet superconducting order parameter with its * d*-vector directed parallel to the c - axis @xmath17 we fix the momentum part of the order parameter as @xmath18 and ignore field - induced symmetry change of the order parameter .",
    "this is the simplest model of chiral state with four - fold symmetric vertical line nodes . in this model , nodes exist at @xmath19 .",
    "however , exact positions of nodes are not important in the following discussion . qualitative behavior of low - energy density of states is determined by the relation between applied field and line nodes .    in order to study the vortex state under a magnetic field parallel to the ab - plane",
    ", we assume a spatial variation of the order parameter , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is described by the abrikosov vortex square lattice with anisotropic superconducting coherence lengths , @xmath22 where , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the superconducting coherence lengths in the c - axis and the ab - plane directions , respectively , and r@xmath25 denotes the coordinate for an axis which is in the ab - plane and is perpendicular to the magnetic field . for example , @xmath21 is equal to zero at the position @xmath26 and @xmath27 , representing the center of a vortex . in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the prefactor @xmath28 is a normalization factor to let the cell average of @xmath29 equal to 1 .",
    "we have adopted the landau gauge for the vector potential as @xmath30    it is apparent that @xmath21 has a periodicity with respect to @xmath31 , which corresponds to the vortex unit cell . the spatial periods @xmath32(c - axis direction ) and @xmath33(ab - plane direction ) are related to q as @xmath34 @xmath35 we choose q so that the ratio @xmath36 is equal to @xmath37 in the whole range of magnetic field .",
    "then , @xmath21 can be rewritten as @xmath38 since the size of a vortex unit cell is inversely proportional to the average induction b , we have the following relation @xmath39    finally , we introduce parameters and physical quantities of interest .",
    "most properties in our system are determined by a single parameter , namely the reduced order parameter @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a spatial average of the order parameter .",
    "note that @xmath43 monotonically decreases as increasing magnetic field h and becomes 0 when h reaches h@xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in how the density of states(dos ) depend on the angle @xmath44 between the field and the line node when a field rotates within the plane .",
    "it is expected that the density of states oscillates with the period @xmath45 , reflecting the fourfold symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "therefore , we can concentrate on the two cases : when a field is applied in the nodal direction(@xmath46 ) , and in the antinodal direction ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "dos is considered to take its minimum and maximum in one and the other of these two cases , respectively .",
    "using above dispersion relations and spatially inhomogeneous superconducting order parameter , we solve the bogoliubov - de gennes(bdg ) equation , which is considered to be the most reliable approach@xcite . @xmath48\\big|_{\\mathbf{r'}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{r } } \\nonumber\\\\    = e u_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r } ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49\\big|_{\\mathbf{r'}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{r } } - \\hat{h_0^*}v_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\nonumber\\\\   = e v_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r } ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 here we assumed @xmath51 , and neglected the effect of the c - axis dispersion . this prescription corresponds to neglecting a coherence along the c - axis direction , or in the quasiclassical sense , to taking account of only the trajectories parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "we will discuss the details of this prescription later in the next section .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) can be decoupled into 2@xmath522 matrix equation for ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54 ) . since both the pairs",
    "satisfy the same equation , we can work on only one of them , say , ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we numerically diagonalize eqs .  ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) by descretizing the coordinate @xmath31 , and obtain sets of eigenvalues @xmath55 and eigenfunctions ( @xmath56,@xmath57 ) . using the obtained eigenfunctions , we calculate dos @xmath58 : @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the translational symmetry along the magnetic field , momentum parallel to the vortices , @xmath60 , becomes a good quantum number .",
    "hence , for each eigenfunction , we can define an angle between the magnetic field and quasiparticle momentum as @xmath61 where we limit the range of @xmath62 to [ 0,@xmath63 due to the reflectional symmetry about the magnetic field . since momentum normal to the magnetic field @xmath64 is not a conserved quantity",
    ", @xmath64 has a finite width @xmath65 for each eigenstate .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath66 is much smaller than 1 ( of the order of @xmath67 ) , not too much below @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , we can consider @xmath62 as a well - defined quantity in the quasiclassical meaning . using this @xmath62 , we discuss the momentum distribution of the quasiparticles contributing to zero - energy density of states .      before showing our results of bdg equations , let us introduce an approximate analytical method , invented by pesch@xcite , and developped by dahm@xcite .",
    "we will compare the obtained results with this approximation .",
    "near h@xmath0 , spatial variation of order parameter is small .",
    "hence , in the eilenberger equations , it is allowed to replace normal component of quasiclassical green functions @xmath69 by its spatial average over a vortex unit cell . with this",
    "averaged quasiclassical green function , we can calculate various observable quantities ( e.g. dos ) in the averaged form over a vortex unit cell . according to dahm@xcite , even much below h@xmath0",
    ", this approximation gives the result quantitatively in agreement with that from the rigorous eilenberger equation .    here",
    ", we summarize the main results of this method . for details , see ref .. we assume that a spatial variation of the order parameter is described by @xmath21 , abrikosov vortex lattice introduced in the section [ secform]a . then",
    ", the averaged density of states @xmath70(in the unit of dos for the normal state @xmath71 ) can be written in the following form , @xmath72 where @xmath73 means averaging on the fermi surface , and in our system , @xmath74 is written as @xmath75,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the projection of the scaled fermi velocity onto the plane normal to the magnetic field , @xmath77 the momentum distribution of zero - energy quasiparticles is simply given by @xmath78",

    "let us see the momentum distribution of quasiparticles contributing to the zero - energy density of states .",
    "figure 2 shows the angle - resolved zedos obtained with the bdg method for several values of @xmath43 . in a low field region",
    "2(a ) ) , it is found that narrow regions in fermi surface are responsible for zedos . in the case of @xmath84 node(@xmath46 ) , a sharp peak appears at @xmath90 which corresponds to the nodal direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the nodal quasiparticles running parallel to the field ( @xmath91 ) give much smaller contribution to zedos .",
    "in the case of @xmath84 antinode(@xmath82 ) , we can observe nodal peaks of the same height at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    with increasing magnetic field ( decreasing @xmath43)(fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , nodal peaks become broader , and the contribution from the core states increases by a large amount , commonly for both @xmath44 . this is because the decrease of order parameter amplitude makes it easier for low - energy quasiparticles to propagate independent of @xmath44 . however , as for the quasi - particles running parallel to the field(i.e .",
    "@xmath94 ) , we can see a big difference between the two cases . in the case of @xmath84 node ,",
    "contribution from the field direction becomes larger with increasing field strength , while in the case of @xmath84 antinode , contribution from this direction remains small .",
    "when the field strength is increased ( @xmath43 is decreased ) furthur ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , nodal peaks become too broad to be identified . in most part of the fermi surface ,",
    "the angle - resolved zedos recover the normal - state value .",
    "nevertheless , appreciable difference still exists for the quasiparticles running parallel to the field",
    ".    we can understand the nature of this difference by using the idea of quasi - classical trajectories . in the quasi - classical theory ,",
    "a trajetory is determined from the fermi velocity and an impact parameter .",
    "zedos can be obtained by summing over contributions from those trajectories . roughly saying , if the sign of order paramter changes on a trajectory , finite contribution to zedos arises due to the formation of andreev bound states .",
    "now let us consider the trajectories parallel to the field . in the case of @xmath84 node ,",
    "quasiparticles propagating along such trajectories feel no superconducting gap due to the gap node irrespective of impact parameter . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath84 antinode ,",
    "those quasiparticles feel finite and spatially uniform gap , because they propagate along the vortices and never cross vortex cores .",
    "( only part of the quasiparticles run right through a vortex core and feel no superconducting gap .",
    "however , contributions from such trajectories are considerably small . )",
    "hence , in the latter case , those quasiparticles are hampered by finite and uniform order parameter and can not contribute to zedos , no matter how small(high ) order parameter amplitude(magnetic field ) is .",

    "however , as for the quasiparticles running in the field direction(@xmath94 ) , the pd method gives larger angle - resolved zedos than that in bdg method .",

    ", we will show our results for the density of states at finite energy .",
    "dos at finite energy is particularly important when we discuss the experimental data , because it depends on the density of states at @xmath105 . in figs .  5 and 6",
    ", we show dos obtained with the bdg and the pd methods , respectively .",
    "let us first discuss the high magnetic field region ( figs .",

    "this character of dos reflects the behavior of the quasiparticles running parallel to the field .",
    "since they feel finite order parameter in the case of @xmath84 antinode , they tend to form a coherence peak .",
    "this coherence - peak like structure appears more clearly in the bdg result due to our prescription as discussed in the previous subsection .    in this high magnetic field region , we observe @xmath107 for @xmath108 independent of the calculational methods .",
    "therefore , if the thermal conductivity or the specific heat is measured in this field region with a rotating magnetic field , maximum will be observed when the field is applied in the nodal direction .",

    "5(a ) and 6(a ) . in this field region , as we have discussed in the previous subsection , @xmath89 at zero - energy",

    "5(a ) and 6(a ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 cross at @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 we have the opposite inequality @xmath113 .",
    "this means that when we take experimental data at a temparature @xmath114 with a rotating magnetic field within the plane , we will observe very small angle variation , because the effects of lower - energy dos and higher - energy dos cancel each other .",

    "so far the thermal conductivity@xcite and the specific heat@xcite of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 have been measured under a rotating in - plane field by several groups . in the experiments of the magnetothermal conductivity , they found no angle variation , except in the vicinity of h@xmath0 .",
    "they attributed the angle variation near h@xmath0 to the anisotropy of h@xmath0 itself , and denied the existence of vertical line nodes in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , in the experiment of the specific heat , fourfold oscillation is found at a lower field , in addition to the angle variation near h@xmath0 .",
    "for the angle variation at the lower field , the specific heat shows maximum at @xmath115[110 ] , while near h@xmath0 maximum is observed at @xmath115[100 ] .",
    "these measurements seem to provide incompatible results .",
    "however , our theoretical analysis gives an answer to this contradiction in the following way .",
    "here we discuss why the thermal conductivity does not show the fourfold oscillation in the low field region . as we show in the previous subsection",
    ", the reversal of @xmath110 and @xmath109 occurs in this field region at @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in order to observe the anisotropy of zedos in this field region , contribution from higher energy part of dos must be removed . however , the thermal conductivity is measured at rather high temperatures @xmath117 , where the effect of high energy part of dos mixes inevitably as we note in the previous subsection .",
    "hence , it is no wonder that the anisotropy of zedos can not be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of the specific heat was conducted at a lower temperature @xmath118 , where the specific heat is sensitive to zedos .",
    "furthurmore , note that the specific heat is more sensitive to the low energy part of dos than the thermal conductivity",
    ". these will be the reason why they can observe the fourfold oscillation .    combining the above considerations",
    ", we can determine the position of line nodes .",
    "in the measurement of the specific heat , the maximum was found at @xmath84[110 ] , while from our calculations we have @xmath119 in a low magnetic field region .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the line nodes exist in the direction [ @xmath120100 ] and [ 0@xmath12010 ] .    in sections [ secre]a and [ secre]b , we have shown that @xmath113 for @xmath121 in a high magnetic field region . therefore , in this field region , there is a possibility that we can observe a fourfold oscillation both in the thermal conductivity and the specific heat , aside from the effect of the anisotropy in @xmath87 .    in summary",
    ", we can explain the data of specific heat and thermal conductivity simultaneously by assuming the vertical lines nodes along [ @xmath120100 ] axis .",
    "the line nodes in this direction is expected in the @xmath122-band from the relation between the fermi surface and crystal symmetry ( ref . ) , and has been confirmed in microscopic analysis ( ref . ) .",
    "strictly speaking , these are not line nodes , because excitation gap is small but finite .",
    "however , tiny gaps serve as line nodes in the finite temperature .",
    "we studied the density of states in the vortex state of a layered superconductor with vertical line nodes on the cylindrical fermi surface under a field parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "we investigated the angle variation of dos with changing field strength .",
    "bogoliubov - de gennes equation and an approximate analytical method due to pesch and dahm were solved .",
    "we found that a field in the nodal direction gives larger zero - energy density of states in a higher magnetic field region , whereas a field in the anti - nodal direction results in larger zero - energy density of states in a lower magnetic field region .",
    "this crossover phenomenon is naturally understood in terms of the momentum distribution of quasiparticles . in a higher field region , under a field applied in the anti - nodal direction , quasiparticles running parallel to the field is hampered by spatially uniform order parameter , and thus gives a smaller contribution to zedos compared with the case in which the field is applied in other directions . in a lower field region ,",
    "nodal quasiparticles not parallel to the field contribute to zedos significantly .",
    "therefore , when the field is applied in the anti - nodal direction , four such nodes are available , which leads to the larger zedos compared with the case of @xmath84 node , where only two such nodes are available .",
    "we investigated the angle variation of the density of states at finite energy .",
    "we found that in a low magnetic field region , dos at @xmath123 shows maximum when the field is parallel to the node , while zedos shows minimum for this field direction . on the basis of this fine structure of dos",

    "<S> we study the vortex state of a layered superconductor with vertical line nodes on its fermi surface when a magnetic field is applied in the ab - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> we rotate the magnetic field within the plane , and analyze the change of low - energy excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the microscopic bogoliubov - de gennes equation and a convenient approximate analytical method developped by pesch and dahm . </S>",
    "<S> both methods give a consistent result . near the upper critical field h@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a larger zero - energy density of states(zedos ) when the magnetic field is applied in the nodal direction , while much below h@xmath0 , larger zedos is observed under a field in the anti - nodal direction . </S>",
    "<S> we give a natural interpretation to this crossover behavior in terms of momentum distribution of low - energy quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the recent field angle variation experiments of thermal conductivity and specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with our results suggest that special care should be taken to derive the position of line nodes from the experimental data . combining the experimental data of the specific heat and our analyses , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 has vertical line nodes in the direction of the a - axis and the b - axis . </S>"
