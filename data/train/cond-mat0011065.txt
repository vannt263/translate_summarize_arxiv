    "the study of coupled dynamics of fast ising spins and slow couplings has received considerable interest recently ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , stimulated by considerations of simultaneous learning and retrieval in recurrent neural networks and the influence of slow atomic diffusion processes in disordered magnetic systems .",
    "generalizing spin systems by taking their interactions to be ( slowly ) time dependent was first considered in @xcite , as a mechanism with which to restore broken ergodicity at low temperature in the sk  model @xcite .",
    "another conceptually similar process , but now describing slow and deterministic synaptic modification in neural systems , driven by averages over neuron states , was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "explicit stochastic dynamical laws for the interactions were defined in @xcite , where spin - glass models with coupled dynamics were studied within replica mean - field theory .",
    "it turned out that the replica dimension in such models has a direct physical interpretation as the ratio of two temperatures characterizing the stochasticity in the spin dynamics and the coupling dynamics , respectively .",
    "later it was shown that the case of negative replica dimension represents an over - frustrated system @xcite . in a similar spirit ,",
    "neural network models with a coupled dynamics of fast neurons and slow neuronal connections were treated in @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "the results previously obtained by others for ising spin models are further extended to a classical xy spin glass with dynamic couplings , whose continuous spin variables are physically more realistic than ising ones .",
    "moreover , the xy model is closely related to models of coupled oscillators @xcite , of which the neural network version @xcite provides a phenomenological description of neuronal firing synchronization in brain tissue .",
    "in particular , we examine the effects of including an explicit frozen randomness into the dynamics of the interaction weights .",
    "the model is solved using the replica formalism .",
    "relevant order parameters are defined and a phase diagram is obtained upon making the replica - symmetric ansatz .",
    "similarly to the ising case , we find two different spin glass phases in addition to a paramagnetic phase .",
    "one spin - glass phase exhibits freezing of the spins in random directions , but on the time - scale of the coupling dynamics these ` frozen directions ' still continue to change .",
    "a second spin - glass phase exhibits freezing of the spins as well as of the couplings , such that even on the large time - scales the ` frozen directions ' of the spins remain stationary .",
    "we perform a detailed stability analysis and calculate the de  almeida - thouless ( at ) lines @xcite ( of which here there are two types ) , where continuous transitions occur to phases of broken replica symmetry .",
    "a brief preliminary account of the first part of the present work has been presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss and tackle the problem of simulating this model numerically .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the classical xy spin glass model with coupled dynamics",
    "is defined . in section 3",
    "the order parameters are calculated in the replica symmetric ( rs ) ansatz and a phase diagram is presented .",
    "as is well known , the solutions of this ansatz are not always stable against replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "therefore , the lines of instability are calculated in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 presents the results of the numerical simultions of this model , followed by a concluding discussion in section 6 .",
    "the appendix describes _ all _ eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the hessian matrix determining the stability of the replica symmetric solutions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 classical two - component spin variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with symmetric couplings ( or exchange interactions ) @xmath3 , taken to be of infinite range .",
    "in contrast to the standard xy spin glass , these couplings are not static but are allowed to evolve in time , albeit slowly . the spins",
    "are taken to have a stochastic glauber - type dynamics such that for _ stationary _ choices of the couplings the microscopic spin probability density would evolve towards a boltzmann distribution @xmath4     \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] with the standard hamiltonian @xmath5 and with inverse temperature @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , and where , at least for the purpose of the dynamics of the spins , the @xmath8 are to be considered as quenched variables .",
    "we remark that this system is equivalent to a system of @xmath0 coupled oscillators with phases @xmath9 @xcite , whose time evolution is described by a langevin equation @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are defined as independent white noise variables , drawn from a gaussian probability distribution with @xmath12    in our model , the couplings also evolve in a stochastic manner , partially in response to the states of the spins and to externally imposed biases .",
    "however , we assume that the spin dynamics is very fast compared to that of the couplings , such that on the time - scales of the couplings the spins are effectively in equilibrium ( i.e. we take the adiabatic limit ) . for the dynamics of the couplings the following langevin form",
    "is proposed : @xmath13 the term @xmath14 , representing local spin correlations associated with the coupling @xmath3 , is a thermodynamic average over the boltzmann distribution ( [ eq : prob ] ) of the spins , given the instantaneous couplings @xmath15 .",
    "no other spins are involved , in order to retain the local character of the couplings .",
    "we remark that only the thermal averages ( or long time averages ) of the spin correlations play a role , rather than the instantaneous correlations , since the dynamics of the couplings is ( by definition ) sufficiently slow .",
    "external biases @xmath16 serve to steer the weights to some preferred values .",
    "the @xmath17 are chosen to be quenched random variables , drawn independently from a gaussian probability distribution with mean @xmath18 and variance @xmath19 : @xmath20          \\label{eqoscill : bij}\\ ] ] and are thus reminiscent of the couplings in the original sk model @xcite . here , in contrast , the @xmath21 generate frozen disorder in the dynamics of the couplings .",
    "the decay term @xmath22 in ( [ def : evcouplings ] ) is added in order to limit the magnitude of the couplings .",
    "finally , the terms @xmath23 represent gaussian white noise contributions , of zero mean and covariance @xmath24 , with associated temperature @xmath25 .",
    "appropriate factors of @xmath0 are introduced in order to ensure non - trivial behaviour in the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 .",
    "the model exhibits three independent global symmetries , which can be expressed efficiently in terms of the pauli spin matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 upon using algebraic relations such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 we see that in the high @xmath32 ( ergodic ) regime these three global symmetries generate the following local identities , respectively : @xmath33    we note that the stochastic equation ( [ def : evcouplings ] ) for the couplings is conservative , i.e. it can be written as @xmath34 with the following effective hamiltionian for the couplings : @xmath35 the term @xmath36 $ ] in this expression is the partition function of the xy spins with instantaneous couplings @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : conservative ] ) that the stationary probability density for the couplings is also of a boltzmann form , with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : couplinghamiltonian ] ) , and that the thermodynamics of the slow system ( the couplings ) are generated by the partition function @xmath37 $ ] , leading to ( modulo irrelevant prefactors ) : @xmath38^n \\exp\\left[\\mu \\tilde\\beta n   \\sum_{k<\\ell}b_{k\\ell}j_{k\\ell } -\\frac{1}{2}~\\mu \\tilde \\beta n\\sum_{k<\\ell}j_{k\\ell}^2 \\right ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : partition function}\\ ] ] in contrast to the more conventional spin systems with frozen disorder , where the replica dimension @xmath39 is a dummy variable , here we find that @xmath39 is given by the ratio @xmath40 , and can take any real non - negative value .",
    "the limit @xmath41 corresponds to a situation in which the coupling dynamics is driven purely by the gaussian white noise , rather than by the spin correlations .",
    "therefore , in this limit the model is equivalent to the xy model with stationary couplings formulated , as in @xcite . for @xmath42",
    "the two characteristic temperatures are the same , and the theory reduces to that corresponding to the exchange interactions being annealed variables . in the limit",
    "@xmath43 the influence of spin correlations on the coupling dynamics dominates , and the couplings @xmath3 only fluctuate modestly ( if at all ) around their mean values @xmath44 .",
    "we define the disorder - averaged free energy per site @xmath45 in which @xmath46 denotes an average over the @xmath21 .",
    "we carry out this average using the identity @xmath47 $ ] , evaluating the latter by analytic continuation from integer @xmath48 .",
    "our system , characterized by the partition function @xmath49 , is thus replicated @xmath48 times ; we label each replica by a roman index .",
    "each of the @xmath48 functions @xmath49 , in turn , is given by ( [ eq : partition function ] ) , and involves @xmath50 which is replaced by the product of @xmath39 further replicas , labeled by greek indices .",

    "we have considered a population of xy spins , evolving according to the coupled langevin equations ( [ def : evspins ] ) and ( [ def : evcouplings ] ) , which were discretised according to a standard euler method , with iteration time step @xmath147 .",
    "several interesting and subtle aspects arise when one attempts to carry out numerical simulations of models of the type studied here , with its widely disparate time - scales .",
    "firstly , it will be clear that the presence of two adiabatically separated time - scales induce extremely large computing times , which prevent us from numerical exploration of the equilibrium regime for large system sizes .",
    "this is a general and systematic constraint , which causes important finite size effects , mainly near the phase transitions . in all our numerical studies we have , as a result , been forced to restrict ourselves to relatively modest systems of @xmath148 spins .",
    "a second point concerns the evolution of the relevant quantities of the problem , spins and couplings , in view of the need to calculate the two main observables of the problem through an averaging process .",
    "this will have to be done very carefully , in order for the measured objects to indeed be identical to ( or at least an acceptable approximation of ) those calculated in the theory . again",
    "the problem is related to having a finite system size : this narrows the time window where , on the one hand , the fast processes can be assumed to have been equilibrated , yet , on the other hand , the slow processes can be assumed not to have taken place .",
    "thirdly , there is the fundamental problem that in regions where replica symmetry no longer holds ( beyond either of the two at lines ) already the spin dynamics will exhibit the traditional phenomena associated with ageing , including extremely slow relaxation towards equilibrium ; even without the additional superimposed slow dynamics of the couplings , it would have been extremely difficult to carry out numerical simulations that would probe the true equilibrium regime .",
    "we have dealt with these practical problems by adopting the following strategy . for a given set of couplings we first let spins to relax to their stationary state",
    "; then we perform the average @xmath149 over a number of time steps sufficiently large to have a statistically reliable measurement .",
    "we subsequently modify the interactions @xmath8 for a certain number of time steps , completing what we call a dual iteration step. this dual process is repeated until the global equilibrium state is reached .",
    "the key questions in the adequate employment of this strategy is to quantify rationally the various durations .",
    "according to the theory , since the time - scale associated with the couplings is infinitely slow compared to that of the fast variables ( the spins ) , in each dual updating step we should modify the interactions @xmath8 only very slightly ( and during only a small number of update steps @xmath150 ) . however , there are limits in practice to the extent to which one can proceed in this manner , in view of the danger of the simulations becoming so slow that they exceed by far one s computing resources . in our simulations",
    "we have updated the interactions during several hundred steps @xmath150 ( after having satisfied ourselves experimentally that a duration somewhere between 500 and 1000 iteration steps is quite appropriate ) before , in turn , allowing the spin states to evolve . in this manner",
    "we have managed to speed up the convergence process towards global equilibrium , whilst continually verifying that the stationary values of the order parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 , thus obtained , are not significantly affected .",
    "even more delicate is deciding on the amount of time during which to evaluate the spin averages occurring in the stochastic equations for the interactions .",
    "if the number of time steps used to calculate these averages is too large , the spins will have enough time to diffuse over the whole circle ( due to finite size fluctuations which would have been absent in an infinitely large system ) , leading to an underestimation of @xmath94 .",
    "our experiments indicate that averaging over a period of between 2000 and 3000 iteration steps ( of duration @xmath150 each ) gives reliable results .",
    "finally , we have to decide on the window size ( the number of dual updating steps ) which we have to average over in order to compute the observables of the system .",
    "the logical approach would appear to be to monitor the evolution of quantities such as the energy ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , starting from the initial state , until the stationary state has been ( or at least appears to have been ) reached .",
    "figure [ energy ] shows a typical numerical experiment .",
    "the dynamics towards equilibrium on this time - scale is ultimately controlled by the slow variables , the couplings .",
    "the spins respond to changes in the couplings in a stochastic master / slave fashion , and only when the slow variables ( the couplings ) have reached a stationary stationary state can we speak about global ( thermal ) equilibrium . in figure [ energy ]",
    "we see that 200 dual steps suffice to ensure the absence of the main transient effects .",
    "the observed dependence on temperature of the two spin - glass order parameters , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , is illustrated in figures [ observables_n2 ] and [ observables ] , together with the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "we have carried out these numerical simulations for the temperature ratios @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "for the smaller temperature ratio @xmath153 we observe that our simulations indeed confirm the existence of two spin - glass phases ; one exhibiting freezing only on spin time - scales , and a second spin - glass phase where freezing is observed on all time scales .",
    "however , quantitative agreement between theory and simulations is extremely difficult to achieve , due to the practical problems outlined above . for @xmath154",
    "the system is in the region where the theory predicts that a first order phase transition from a paramagnetic phase to a second - spin glass phase should be found .",
    "we observe a good agreement between theory and simulations , except for temperatures close to the transition , where finite size effects are obviously increasingly important .",
    "in addition to the above equilibrium observables , we have investigated other , non - equilibrium , aspects of our model , by way of further illustration .",
    "we have measured , for instance , the distribution @xmath155 $ ] of phases @xmath156 , defined via @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ phase ] shows this distribution at three different stages during the evolution towards equilibrium , for system parameters identical to those of figure [ observables ] .",
    "initially the phases were distributed uniformly ; one observes this distribution to deform spontaneously into a bi - modal one , driven in conjunction with the feedback provided by the ( slow ) dynamics of the couplings .",
    "in this paper we have discussed and solved a version of the classical xy  spin - glass model in which both the spins and their couplings evolve stochastically , according to coupled equations , but on widely disparate time - scales .",
    "the spins play the role of fast variables , whereas the couplings evolve only very slowly , but according to local stochastic laws which involve the states of the spins . in the context of disordered magnetic systems",
    "this model describes a situation where one takes into account the possible effects of slow diffusion of the magnetic impurities , without necessarily assuming energy equi - partitioning between the slow variables ( the impurity locations ) and the spins ( hence the potentially different temperatures associated with each ) .",
    "alternatively , in the context of neural systems this model would describe coupled neural oscillators @xcite with autonomous stochastic hebbian - type synaptic adaptation on the basis of the degree of firing synchrony of pairs of neurons .",
    "we have solved our model within the replica - symmetric ( rs ) mean - field theory , involving two levels of replicas : one level related to the ( slow ) couplings , and one related to the disorder in the problem ( the symmetry breaking terms in the dynamics of the couplings , representing preferred random values of the latter ) . the solution of our model , in rs ansatz , is mathematically similar to that of the xy model with static couplings , but with one - step rsb .",
    "this is reminiscent of the general connection between the breaking of replica symmetry and the existence of dynamics on many time scales @xcite .",
    "we have discussed in detail the stability of the rs - solutions , including the calculation of _ all _ eigenvalues and their multiplicities ( details of which can be found in the appendices ) .",
    "it turns out that two distinct replicon eigenvalues determine the region of stability , and thus the region of validity of the rs solution .",
    "the thermodynamic phase diagram is found to exhibit two different spin - glass phases , one where freezing occurs on all time - scales , and one where freezing occurs only on the ( fast ) time - scale of the spin dynamics .",
    "we also find both first- and second - order transitions ; the origin of the first order ones is the positive feedback in the system ( compared to a system with stationary spin - couplings ) which is induced by the super - imposed coupling dynamics .",
    "as could have been expected , the physics of the present model resembles that of the sk  model with dynamic couplings , apart from a re - scaling in temperature and provided an appropriate adjustment of the calculation of the at  lines in @xcite is made .",
    "our calculations show how the methods used for solving the ising case can be easily adapted to deal with more complicated spin types , and in addition illustrates further the robustness of the phase diagrams describing the behaviour of large spin systems with dynamic couplings .",
    "numerical simulations present further interesting technical challenges , due to the existence of adiabatically separated time scales ( which requires equilibration of two different nested stochastic processes in order to test the theory ) , in addition to the already highly non - trivial and extremely slow dynamics of the fast ( spin ) system . in spite of the important finite size effects , which are inevitable given the practical constraints on available cpu time , our results show good agreement with the theory and confirm the main characteristics of the predicted behaviour .",
