    "massive elliptical galaxies with similar optical luminosities have hot gas x - ray luminosities that range over two orders of magnitude .",
    "the origin of this scatter , shown in figure 1 , has received much attention but a full understanding remains elusive .",
    "there is evidence that gas loss by ram pressure ( and tidal ) stripping has reduced @xmath0 in elliptical galaxies or groups orbiting within rich clusters of galaxies ( biller et al .",
    "2004 ; machacek et al .",
    "2005 ; sun et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , an enormous range in @xmath0 also prevails among non - interacting ellipticals that are isolated or at the centers of isolated galaxy groups .",
    "the correlation between the spatial extent of the x - ray emission and @xmath0 suggests that the driver for this scatter is a variation in the virial mass @xmath7 of the halo that surrounds otherwise similar elliptical galaxies ( mathews & brighenti 1998 ) .",
    "the virial mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 are found by fitting dark nfw halos to the total mass distribution derived from x - ray observations of the hot gas density and temperature in @xmath9 , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .    to gain further insight into the broad range of x - ray emission from optically similar galaxies ,",
    "we draw attention here to those ellipticals with the largest x - ray luminosities .",
    "these isolated galaxy / groups have been variously referred to as `` [ x - ray ] overluminous elliptical galaxies ( olegs ) '' ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1999 ) or `` fossil groups '' ( ponman et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the concept of fossilized groups is meant to imply that they are relics of merging among galaxies in a group environment , although all elliptical galaxies may qualify for this designation .",
    "jones et al . ( 2003 ) provide an operational definition for fossil groups in terms of the magnitude difference between the first and second brightest group galaxies . for our purposes here we simply consider those elliptical galaxies with the largest @xmath0 in the @xmath10 plot , many of which have been previously regarded as fossils or olegs .",
    "we then note that several of the best studied of these galaxies have nearly the same baryon mass fraction as the most massive galaxy clusters and the _ wmap _ value , @xmath3 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) , i.e. they appear to be baryonically closed .",
    "most baryons are in the hot intragroup gas .",
    "the data in figure 1 are mostly taken from osullivan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( open squares ) , but we have added additional x - ray luminous ellipticals assembled from more recent observations ( filled symbols ) with properties listed in table 1 .",
    "these x - ray luminous systems define the upper envelope of the luminosity distribution in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "while all estimates of the baryon mass fraction @xmath11 require uncertain extrapolations beyond the observations to the virial radius @xmath8 , @xmath11 for several x - ray luminous groups in table 1 indicate near or complete baryon closure .",
    "all data have been scaled to @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "galaxy groups and poor clusters with @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 kev are known to deviate systematically below the @xmath4 relation established by more massive clusters , suggesting additional non - gravitational energy by cosmic preheating or agn activity ( as reviewed by voit 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , it is remarkable that groups in table 1 with @xmath17 kev have survived with most or all of their baryonic component intact .",
    "ngc 5044 is a good example of such a group . for the purpose of this discussion ,",
    "we have made a preliminary mass model of ngc 5044 based on gas density and temperature profiles observed to @xmath18 kpc from buote et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 , & 2006 in prep . ) . in the central regions",
    "the azimuthally averaged gas density @xmath19 was replaced with @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( buote et al . 2003 ) is the filling factor of the denser gas component at each radius responsible for most of the observed emission .",
    "the model was constructed by first setting the stellar parameters  a de vaucouleurs profile with luminosity @xmath22 @xmath23 , effective radiius @xmath24 kpc and stellar mass to light ratio @xmath25  that establish the total stellar mass @xmath26 @xmath15 and potential .",
    "the dark halo is assumed to have an nfw mass profile with an adjustable virial mass @xmath7 and concentration @xmath27 expected for this mass ( bullock et al .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is integrated for @xmath28 , fixing the gas temperature @xmath29 to fit observations and extrapolating to larger radii in a @xmath30 plot . @xmath7 and",
    "the innermost gas density are varied until an excellent fit is achieved to the @xmath31 profile throughout the observed region .",
    "the resulting virial mass , @xmath32 @xmath15 , is similar to our previous estimate ( buote et al .",
    "2004 ) and the virial radius @xmath33 kpc with @xmath34 and @xmath35 gm @xmath36 . when the observed gas density profile in ngc 5044 is extrapolated to @xmath8 ( buote et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 in prep . ) , maintaining the same power law @xmath37 @xmath36 observed in the region @xmath38 kpc , we find that the total gas mass is @xmath39 @xmath15 , in agreement with the mass model . the mass fraction in gas is @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to a baryon ratio @xmath41 , assuming a ( conservative ) star formation efficiency of @xmath42% ( lin & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "at least @xmath43% of the initial baryons in ngc 5044 is still bound to the group . evidently , the non - gravitational heating received by the gas is @xmath44% of the gas binding energy , @xmath45 ergs . where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the gas density and gravitational acceleration from our mass model for ngc 5044 . ] for simplicity we assume that the percentage difference between the observed @xmath48 and the value @xmath49 expected from wmap is proportional to the amount of non - gravitational energy that the gas received as a percentage of @xmath50",
    ".    the gas heating efficiency associated with accretion onto the central black hole in ngc 5044 must be consistent with gas retention .",
    "the central galaxy with mass @xmath51 @xmath15 is expected to contain a black hole of mass @xmath52 @xmath15 ( haering & rix 2004 ) . during the accretion history of the central black hole ,",
    "suppose that a fraction @xmath53 of the rest energy @xmath54 heats the intragroup gas , then gas retention at the 80% level suggests that @xmath55 , although some of this energy will be radiated away .",
    "the energy radiated by ngc 5044 during several gyrs is @xmath56 ergs and , since no gas is observed to cool below @xmath57 in ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "2003 ) , the minimum accretion heating efficiency is @xmath58 .",
    "evidently only a tiny fraction of the accretion energy released by the central black hole ( @xmath59 ) can have heated the intragroup gas in ngc 5044 .",
    "nevertheless , substantial ongoing agn - related heating is currently observed near the center of the ngc 5044 group ( buote et al .",
    "2003 ; mathews , brighenti & buote 2004 ) .",
    "the non - gravitational energy received by the hot intracluster gas from supernovae can be estimated from the total mass of iron observed in the ngc 5044 group , @xmath60 where the estimated total gas mass is @xmath61 @xmath15 , @xmath62 is the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass including helium , and the total stellar mass in the group is @xmath63 times larger than @xmath64 .",
    "the mass - weighted gas iron abundance in the ngc 5044 group is @xmath65 and we adopt a mean stellar abundance @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . the total iron mass can be expressed in terms of supernova yields ( @xmath68 @xmath15 and @xmath69 @xmath15 ) and @xmath70 , the number of supernovae per @xmath15 of initial stars formed , @xmath71 we assume that none of the supernova iron either cooled ( brighenti & mathews 2005 ) or was buoyantly expelled to @xmath72 . if all stars formed at high redshift with a salpeter imf between 0.08 and 100 @xmath15 the number of stars with mass above @xmath73 that become type ii supernovae is @xmath74 per @xmath15 . if @xmath75 is the current stellar mass in the group , the initial mass is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the fraction of the original stellar mass ejected from stars ( brighenti & mathews 1999 ) . if the iron mass @xmath78 is eliminated between the two equations above , we find that the number of type ia supernova per @xmath15 of initial stars is @xmath79 . the total energy released by both types of supernovae is @xmath80 where we assume @xmath81 ergs per supernova and @xmath82 . since @xmath83 it is possible that supernovae energy could eject @xmath84% of the baryons from the group .",
    "but our assumption that all of the snii energy is communicated to the hot gas may not be plausible since it makes no allowance for radiation losses in snii remnants .",
    "of course a flatter imf ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999 ; nagashima et al .",
    "2005 ) could generate enough snii energy to eject 20% of the gas ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 2001 ) .",
    "clearly , the large baryon fraction @xmath11 observed in ngc 5044 and other x - ray luminous groups imposes a significant constraint on non - gravitational heating .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the groups with filled symbols in figure 1 along the upper envelope of the @xmath10 distribution correlates with @xmath86 as @xmath87 erg s@xmath13 ( also see jones et al .",
    "2003 ) . if these groups are essentially baryonically closed , as we propose here , then @xmath86 for the group - centered e galaxy should also increase with the virial mass .",
    "this correlation is shown in figure 2a where we plot those groups from table 1 having known estimated @xmath7 .",
    "similar @xmath88 correlations have been found from the 2mass survey ( lin & mohr 2004 ) and the galaxy - galaxy lensing data of cooray & milosavljevic ( 2005 ) who find @xmath5 , which agrees well with the group data in figure 2a . for ngc 6482 ( the leftmost point in figure 2a )",
    "may be significantly underestimated since the x - ray observations extend only to @xmath89 kpc , close to the expected transition between the influence of the dark halo mass and the much smaller stellar mass . ]",
    "the @xmath88 correlation arises because group - centered elliptical galaxies grow by mergers as massive satellite group galaxies undergo dynamical friction in the dark halos .",
    "progressively more massive halos contain more mergeable galaxies so the final @xmath86 of the group - centered elliptical increases with @xmath7 until @xmath90 @xmath15 where dynamical friction is reduced by the small galaxy / halo mass ratio .",
    "all baryonically closed groups have been dynamically processed in this way .",
    "the ratio of the total halo mass to that of the central galaxy @xmath91 is of particular interest .",
    "the correlation @xmath92 @xmath15 shown in figure 2a ( dashed line ) , when combined with the stellar mass to light ratio @xmath93 ( trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) , results in @xmath94 .",
    "this ratio is larger than the dynamical masses determined from the sloan digital sky survey : @xmath95 ( based on @xmath96 from prada et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath97 ( padmanabhan et al . 2004 ) for e galaxies comparable to those in table 1 .",
    "this suggests that optically similar elliptical galaxies with larger @xmath98 may have somewhat more massive dark halos .",
    "the mean gas temperature for these groups plotted in figure 2b also correlates with optical luminosity of the group - centered galaxy as indicated by the dotted line with slope @xmath99 . since @xmath100 from the table 1 data in figure 1 ,",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath101 also correlate with @xmath98 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of baryonically closed groups ( @xmath104 ) scales approximately as @xmath105 [ for the mean gas temperatures of the groups in table 1 , @xmath106 kev , the bolometric x - ray emissivity is insensitive to temperature ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) ] .",
    "however , the @xmath107 relation also depends on the nfw concentration @xmath108 ( bullock et al .",
    "we estimate @xmath109 for closed groups ( @xmath110 ) by filling nfw potentials with isothermal gas with @xmath111 k taken from shimizu et al .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity within @xmath8 is @xmath112 erg s@xmath13 for @xmath113 , where we assume @xmath5 from figure 2a ( dashed line ) .",
    "this locus of maximum x - ray luminosity , @xmath1 erg s@xmath13 , is shown with a dotted line in figure 1 . if the gas temperature @xmath114 then @xmath115 suggests that @xmath116 similar to kaiser ( 1986 ) .",
    "we propose that galaxy groups lying near the upper envelope of the @xmath10 distribution in figure 1 are nearly or completely baryonically closed boxes similar to more massive clusters .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the baryon fraction estimates listed in table 1 and the proximity of the observations in figure 1 to the approximate dotted line locus for the maximum @xmath98 expected from baryonically closed groups observed to @xmath8 .",
    "the projected x - ray luminosity of our mass model for ngc 5044 beyond @xmath117 varies as @xmath118 so we expect that @xmath98 for galaxies with filled symbol points in figure 1 will creep upward toward the dotted line when observed with larger apertures and more sensitive detectors .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect to find galaxy / groups in the future that lie significantly above the filled circles and squares in figure 1 .",
    "baryonically closed groups provide interesting constraints on the amount of non - gravitational heating acquired by the intragroup gas . to retain most or all of the gas in these groups , the gas heating by the central black hole ( agn ) must be @xmath119 or @xmath120 kev per particle , consistent with typical values @xmath121 kev per particle required to account for deviations from self - similarity in the @xmath4 plot for clusters ( e.g. tornatore et al .",
    "2003 ; voit 2005 ) .",
    "we also find that the combined energy of all past supernovae is insufficient to remove significant amounts of intragroup gas unless the imf is flatter than salpeter ( brighenti & mathews 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "another necessary attribute of baryonically closed groups is that they are spatially isolated , i.e. they have not lost mass by ram - stripping during mergers with comparable or larger systems .",
    "spatially isolated e galaxies and groups are of particular interest because of the strong limits they impose on non - gravitational heating .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that some isolated e galaxies have much lower @xmath98 than ellipticals in baryonically closed groups .",
    "for example , in figure 1 we mark with + symbols two isolated e galaxies found recently by reda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that are near the bottom of the distribution .",
    "this large variation of @xmath98 for isolated es of similar @xmath86 in figure 1 may result from normal cosmic variance .",
    "it would be interesting to determine if these and other isolated galaxies have unusually undermassive dark halos ( allowing winds ) , if they contain more energetically active ( and massive ) black holes or if their star formation efficiencies are unusually large , since such variations could help explain why these isolated galaxy / groups are not baryonically closed . by this means it will eventually be possible to determine if the non - gravitational heating arises primarily from the central black hole .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to assemble @xmath7 , @xmath122 and optical luminosities for all isolated e galaxies and groups throughout the @xmath10 plane .",
    "finally , we have shown that baryonically closed groups can inform us about the important relationship between the optical luminosity and mass of the group - centered galaxy and the mass of the surrounding ( group ) dark halo .",
    "the preliminary data currently available suggest that the dark halos are about @xmath123 times more massive than the central ( non - cd ) elliptical galaxy .",
    "these conclusions can be explored further in the @xmath10 plane by considering all elliptical galaxies for which x - ray observations provide accurate @xmath7 .",
