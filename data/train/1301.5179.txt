    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) was introduced in physics by wigner to describe the spectral properties of heavy nuclei .",
    "it is now a huge subject with applications in areas as varied as mesoscopic physics , quantum field theory , number theory , wireless communications and econophysics  @xcite .",
    "the statistics of eigenvalues plays a crucial role in the study of random matrix ensembles ( rme ) .",
    "it not only encodes valuable information about a given ensemble but also enables one to calculate important observables related to the eigenvalues .",
    "quite often one needs to evaluate the eigenvalue densities numerically .",
    "this is because the analytical expressions for the densities are available only for certain special ensembles and/or in asymptotic limits .",
    "in addition , the numerical simulation of spectra facilitates the verification of known analytical results .",
    "the conventional numerical schemes for generating eignvalue densities rely on either the diagonalisation approach using the matrix model whenever available , or implementing the boltzmann - sampling - based monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "the latter uses dyson s log - gas picture for the eigenvalues of rme  @xcite .",
    "we propose here a method based on wang - landau algorithm ( wla )  @xcite which serves as a powerful alternative to these approaches .",
    "our proposed method relies on calculating the microcanonical density of states of the dyson log gas associated with the given random matrix ensemble .",
    "the density of eigenvalues or distribution of any related observable ( function of eigenvalues ) can be obtained from this information .",
    "rme are characterised by the dyson index @xmath0 which plays the role of inverse temperature in the log - gas thermodynamics .",
    "the superiority of wla over the conventional schemes lies in that one can evaluate the spectral density as well as the distributions of related observables for multiple @xmath0 values in a single simulation .",
    "the method , therefore , can be viewed as a natural tool in exploring the @xmath0-ensembles  @xcite .",
    "moreover , wla provides the additional advantage of producing density of states of the log gas during the simulation , which can be used to investigate its thermodynamic properties  @xcite .",
    "wang - landau algorithm  @xcite is a non - boltzmann sampling method which was originally applied to standard statistical systems like ising and potts models which exhibit discrete energy states .",
    "wla aims at estimating accurately the microcanonical density of states @xmath1 ( up to a multiplicative constant ) by performing a random walk in the energy space . the key idea behind this algorithm",
    "is that if during the random walk the configurations @xmath2 with associated energy @xmath3 are sampled with a probability proportional to @xmath4 , the corresponding histogram @xmath5 of visited configurations becomes flat .",
    "the density of states being unknown at the beginning of the simulation , one starts with an initial guess for @xmath1 which is converged towards the true density in an iterative manner .",
    "since the method gives direct access to the density of states of the system , which is independent of the temperature , one can calculate various thermodynamic averages by canonical reweighting at arbitrary nonzero temperature  @xcite .",
    "there has been several improvements and refinements to the wla by various authors  @xcite , consequently it has been successfully applied to systems possessing continuous energy spectra also , e.g. , liquid crystals , polymers , biomolecules etc .",
    "see for example  @xcite , where the authors propose a hybrid algorithm based on the wang - landau and transition matrix monte carlo methods . in our calculations",
    "we implement the @xmath6 variant  @xcite of wla which facilitates , in general , a faster convergence rate than the conventional scheme .    from the information of @xmath1 we can immediately evaluate the canonical probability at arbitrary nonzero temperature @xmath7 as @xmath8 @xmath9 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "the sum in the above equation runs over the sampled energy points in the energy window of interest .",
    "the canonical average of an observable depending explicitly on energy , say @xmath10 , can then be easily calculated as @xmath11 for example , the moments of energy @xmath12 can be evaluated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . by definition",
    "we have @xmath15 .",
    "the average energy is given by the first moment , @xmath16 .",
    "the specific heat , which is related to the second cumulant of energy , is obtained using @xmath17 .    for evaluation of the quantities which do not depend explicitly on @xmath3 ,",
    "say @xmath18 , there are two ways one can proceed .",
    "the first approach is based on an extension , where instead of performing the random walk in only @xmath3-space , one performs the random walk in two - dimensional @xmath19 space with probability proportional to @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the two - dimensional density of states  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of observable @xmath18 can be calculated at the end of simulation using @xmath22 which can be further used to calculate the average @xmath23 using @xmath24 . however , performing the random walk in two - dimensional space is usually computationally expensive , being plagued with convergence issues etc .",
    "the alternative approach relies on estimating @xmath1 first and then performing a production run  @xcite .",
    "the production run comprises a post - simulation employing  wang - landau resampling \" using the already converged @xmath1 . during this run ,",
    "a histogram @xmath25 of the visits in the @xmath19 space is generated .",
    "the joint density @xmath21 can then be obtained using  @xcite @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) can finally be used to study the desired observable .",
    "dyson in his pioneering work provided a physical picture to the eigenvalues of rme  @xcite .",
    "he showed that the eigenvalues can be identified with the positions of charged particles interacting via two - dimensional coulombic repulsion and executing brownian motion .",
    "in addition a position dependent potential may be present .",
    "dyson s log - gas model  @xcite is of fundamental importance to the field of rmt and has been applied in various contexts  @xcite . under this formalism the three invariant ensembles of random matrices , viz .",
    "orthogonal , unitary and symplectic  @xcite , turn out to be the equilibrium states of this system at three special temperatures @xmath27 , @xmath9 being set equal to 1 .",
    "dumitriu and edelman , by dropping the invariance requirement , proposed matrix models which correspond to general @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "moreover , very recently it has been shown that by considering a special diffusive matrix model , invariant @xmath0-ensembles ( @xmath0 restricted to certain continuous domains ) may be realised  @xcite .    in rmt one",
    "usually deals with the ensembles of unitary matrices and hermitian matrices , which share the following generic structure for the joint probability density ( jpd ) of eigenvalues ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the partition function , @xmath33 being the appropriate domain of integration .",
    "@xmath34 is the characteristic random matrix eigenvalue - repulsion term , and @xmath35 is the weight function which decides specific features of a given ensemble . note that , for brevity , we use the term hermitian to refer to real symmetric and self - dual quaternion matrices also .     and @xmath36 .",
    "solid lines are the result of wand - landau simulation . for comparison",
    "we also show the boltzmann - sampling based monte carlo results ( symbols ) .",
    "wla gives the densities for arbitrary @xmath28 in a single simulation whereas the conventional monte carlo needs separate simulation for each @xmath0 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the unitary case the eigenvalues are located on a unit circle in the complex plane , i.e. , they are of the form @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] being the eigenangles ( or eigenphases ) .",
    "we will use @xmath2 below to refer interchangeably to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the important case of dyson s ( uniform ) circular ensemble  @xcite . in the hermitian case",
    "@xmath42 are positions on the real line .",
    "jacobi family of rme is obtained when @xmath43 is chosen as weight functions associated with the classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "for example , @xmath44 , @xmath45 lead to the gaussian , laguerre and jacobi ensembles of random matrices  @xcite . in these three cases",
    "the @xmath46 lie in @xmath47 and @xmath48 $ ] respectively . the restrictions on @xmath49 are determined from the normalisability of the weight functions .",
    "the jpd of eigenvalues can be used to extract important information about the ensemble .",
    "for example , we can calculate the ( marginal ) density of eigenvalues , viz .",
    ", @xmath50 .",
    "here @xmath51 represents the ensemble average with respect to the jpd in eq .  .",
    "@xmath52 provides the information about average behaviour of the eigenvalues and therefore reveals the general features of a given ensemble .",
    "similarly , the distribution of an observable @xmath53 depending on @xmath2 s can be obtained using @xmath54 .",
    "the jpd of eigenvalues in eq . can be recast as a canonical boltzmann - gibbs probability density : @xmath55 here @xmath3 represents potential energy of the system , @xmath56 in the log - gas picture the first term in the above equation represents the two - dimensional coulombic repulsion between the charges , while @xmath57 represents the local binding potential seen by the charges  @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is related to the weight function @xmath35 in eq .   as @xmath58 eq .",
    "provides the energy function which we use in wla to perform the random walk in @xmath3-space and to derive the density of states @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 can eventually be used to generate the density of eigenvalues and distributions of related observables .",
    "we give the details in the next section .",
    "it can be shown that for the above mentioned _ classical _ weight functions , @xmath3 is bounded from below , i.e. , there exists an @xmath59 such that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 @xcite . for the dyson s circular ensemble",
    ", minimum energy configuration corresponds to the case when the angular separation between any two adjacent charges on the unit circle is equal . in this case",
    "we have @xcite @xmath62          in the above examples for the classical ensembles we have chosen @xmath35 in a way that @xmath57 in eq .",
    "is @xmath0-independent .",
    "however , often this is not the case  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the density of transmission eigenvalues , which govern the statistics of conductance ( or transmission ) in chaotic cavities , is given by  @xcite @xmath71 here @xmath72 , and @xmath73 represent the number of modes in the two ideal leads connected to the cavity .",
    "@xmath74 in this case is @xmath75 , which makes the energy @xmath3 in eq .",
    "@xmath0-dependent too . as a consequence , for each @xmath0 we will need to do a separate simulation .",
    "this completely nullifies the usefulness of wla over the conventional monte carlo scheme .",
    "however , we can circumvent this problem by considering the transformation @xmath76 .",
    "the factor coming from the jacobian of transformation gets rid of the unwanted @xmath77 in the exponent and we obtain @xmath78 wla can now be implemented using the @xmath0-independent energy function , eq .   with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , in this case @xmath81 the term @xmath82 in the sum above should be taken ( in a limiting sense ) as 0 for @xmath83 . with the @xmath0-independent energy function",
    "we can obtain the density @xmath84 for multiple values of @xmath0 in a single simulation .",
    "the density of @xmath85 s can then be trivially obtained using the relation @xmath86 .    as our next example",
    "we consider the jpd for @xmath0-wishart ensemble as derived in @xcite : @xmath87 here @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it has been shown that for large @xmath90 , a crossover between marenko - pastur and the gamma distribution @xmath91 is observed for @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "similar to the previous example , the above jpd as such is not suitable for the implementation of wla .",
    "we therefore carry out the transformation @xmath93 .",
    "this gives us the following equation for jpd of @xmath94 s : @xmath95 this is essentially the laguerre jpd in variables @xmath96 with @xmath97 in the effective weight function @xmath98 identified as @xmath99 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath3-function is given by eq .",
    "with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the ground energy @xmath59 follows from eq .   by setting @xmath102 .",
    "the expression of density in original variables can be obtained as @xmath103 .",
    "we would like to remark that one can also consider the case @xmath104 in eq .",
    ", for which the jpd corresponds to the classical wishart ensemble . in this case",
    "we carry out the transformation @xmath105 , similar to the one considered in transmission eigenvalue jpd above .",
    "while investigation of the thermodynamic behaviour of these ensembles is interesting in itself  @xcite , our focus here is on the evaluation of density of eigenvalues .    a successful implementation of wla using the energy function , eq",
    ".   relies primarily on a reasonable choice of the @xmath106 space to be explored , i.e. , the range ( windows ) for eigenvalues / eigenangles and energy . for the energy window ( @xmath107 ) , it is advantageous to shift @xmath3 in eq .",
    "as @xmath108 if @xmath59 is a priori known .",
    "thus we perform the simulation with @xmath109 as the energy function with the lower end of @xmath107 set to zero .",
    "the energy being unbounded from above , fixing a reasonable upper cut off for the @xmath107 requires some hit and trial .",
    "we can get some idea from a pre monte carlo run where energies are generated for random configurations .",
    "this is also helpful when there is no a - priori information about @xmath59 , and one has to set a reasonable lower cut off also .",
    "as an example of such a case we have considered the weight function @xmath110 in eq .  .",
    "another option is to implement the self - adaptive method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-window @xmath111 can be trivially fixed for ensembles which have a finite support for the eigenvalues / eigenangles , e.g. , jacobi ( @xmath112 $ ] ) and circular ( @xmath38 $ ] ) ensembles . however , when the eigenvalues do not have a finite support , e.g. in gaussian and laguerre ensembles , we have to carefully choose the window .",
    "the choice of @xmath113 in these cases should be such that the @xmath1 in the @xmath107 does not change appreciably with further increase in the @xmath113 width .",
    "one can also get a crude estimate using the large @xmath114-asymptotic result , if available .",
    "for example , in the case of gaussian weight @xmath115 in eq .  , the eigenvalues give rise to wigner semicircle of radius @xmath116 in the large @xmath114 limit .",
    "therefore we can restrict the @xmath113 size to be of this order .",
    "afterwards , the windows are divided into reasonable number of bins for sampling in the @xmath106 space . in general , too many bins will hinder the convergence , while too little bins will lead to poor results .    as mentioned before",
    ", we implement the @xmath6 variant of wla for the simulation  @xcite .",
    "once the @xmath1 has converged to the desired accuracy  @xcite , we perform the production run to obtain the joint histogram @xmath117 . owing to the symmetry of @xmath2 s we update @xmath117 by simultaneously tracking all the eigenvalues instead of just one .",
    "this speeds up building of the histogram .",
    "the density of @xmath2 s can finally be obtained using eqs .   and  .",
    "we can also obtain the distributions or averages of multiple observables which depend on the eigenvalues by maintaining joint histogram for each of them ; as has been done in some of the examples considered .",
