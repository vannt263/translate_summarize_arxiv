    "<S> we report results of a wang - landau study of the random bond square ising model with nearest- ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) antiferromagnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case @xmath2 for which the competitive nature of interactions produces a sublattice ordering known as superantiferromagnetism and the pure system undergoes a second - order transition with a positive specific heat exponent @xmath3 . for a particular disorder strength we study the effects of bond randomness and we find that , while the critical exponents of the correlation length @xmath4 , magnetization @xmath5 , and magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 increase when compared to the pure model , the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the disordered system obeys weak universality and hyperscaling similarly to other two - dimensional disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the specific heat exhibits an unusually strong saturating behavior which distinguishes the present case of competing interactions from other two - dimensional random bond systems studied previously .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : classical monte carlo simulations , classical phase transitions ( theory ) , finite - size scaling , disordered systems ( theory )    in the last three decades , the effect of quenched randomness to the critical behavior of statistical models in two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensions ( 3d ) has been the subject of intense studies . </S>",
    "<S> first - order transitions are known to be dramatically softened under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite , while continuous transitions may have their exponents altered under random fields or random bonds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are some very useful phenomenological arguments and some , perturbative in nature , theoretical results , pertaining to the occurrence and nature of phase transitions under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most celebrated criterion is that suggested by harris  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion relates directly the persistence , under random bonds , of the non random behavior to the specific heat exponent @xmath9 of the corresponding pure system . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 is positive , then the disorder will be relevant , i.e. , under the effect of the disorder , the system will reach a new critical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , if @xmath10 is negative , disorder is irrelevant and the critical behavior will not change . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath11 is an inconclusive , marginal case . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d ising model falls into this category and although it is the most studied case , it is still controversial  @xcite . in general and despite the intense efforts of the last years on several different models , our current understanding of the quenched randomness effects is rather limited and the situation appears still unclear for both cases of first- and second - order phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the present letter is the first investigation of the bond disorder effects on an interesting 2d model with competing interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the square ising model with nearest- ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) antiferromagnetic interactions for a certain value of the coupling ratio @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for this value of @xmath12 , the pure system undergoes a clear second - order phase transition ( from the superantiferromagnetic ( saf ) state to the paramagnetic state ) and accurate estimates of critical exponents have recently been reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the value for the critical exponent @xmath9 of the specific heat of this generalized ising model is very close ( almost identical , see the discussion below ) to that of the 2d three - state potts model ( @xmath13 ) our choice of studying this case , closely follows the motivation of similar numerical studies performed earlier by kim  @xcite and picco  @xcite on the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , due to the difficulties and possible crossover effects in the marginal case of @xmath11 ( 2d ising model ) it is desirable to study here the critical behavior induced by disorder in a case where the pure model has a positive specific heat exponent and according to the harris criterion  @xcite is expected to reach a new critical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> our results will be therefore profitably compared to those of kim  @xcite and picco  @xcite for the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet and possible interesting differences may reflect aspects that are due to the different microscopic interactions .    in zero field , </S>",
    "<S> the pure system under consideration , is governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath14 where here both nearest- </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) interactions are assumed to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the model develops at low temperatures saf order for @xmath15  @xcite and by symmetry the critical behavior associated with the saf ordering is the same under @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider here only the case @xmath2 , with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> for this case ( @xmath18 ) , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition , in accordance with the commonly accepted scenario for many years of a non - universal critical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent wang - landau  @xcite study of malakis  @xcite has refined earlier estimates  @xcite for the correlation length exponent @xmath4 and values very close to those of the 2d three - state potts model @xmath19(potts)@xmath20  @xcite were obtained . from the finite - size scaling ( fss ) of the pseudocritical temperatures  @xcite it was found that @xmath19(saf;@xmath18)@xmath21 and the subsequent study of monroe and kim  @xcite , using the fisher zeroes of the partition function , yielded a quite matching estimate : @xmath19(saf;@xmath18)@xmath22 . furthermore , from the fss of the specific heat data an estimate for the ratio @xmath23 was also found  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , from the magnetic data and in accordance with an earlier conjecture of binder and landau  @xcite , malakis  @xcite found additional evidence of the weak universality scenario  @xcite and obtained the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the above three ratios of exponents satisfy the rushbrook relation , assuming that @xmath26 , which is very close to the estimate obtained from the shift behavior of the saf @xmath18 model , thus providing self consistency to the estimation scheme . from these results , it is tempting to conjecture that the saf model with @xmath18 obeys the same thermal exponents with the 2d three - state potts model ( @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite ) , but the respective values of the magnetic critical exponents are different ( @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite ) .    in the present study , we consider a particular type of bond disorder , the same for both nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor spins @xmath31 and @xmath32 according to the following bimodal distribution @xmath33;\\;\\ ; \\frac{j_{1}+j_{2}}{2}=1;\\;\\;r=\\frac{j_{2}}{j_{1}}=0.6.\\ ] ]    size dependence of the maxima of the specific heat for the pure ( filled squares ; data taken from reference  @xcite ) and the random bond model ( filled circles).,width=12 ]    the resulting disordered ( random bond ) version of the hamiltonian defined in equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) reads now as @xmath34 this particular choice of the disorder strength @xmath35 is strong enough , as will be shown below , to observe dramatic saturation effects on the originally diverging behavior of the specific heat of the pure model . </S>",
    "<S> only this case will be considered in this letter ; the more general case for other values of the disorder strength together with a comparative study with the 2d random bond ising model and also details of our numerical scheme will be presented in a longer paper . </S>",
    "<S> the present wang - landau study  @xcite closely follows our recent implementations of an energy restricted sampling , known as critical minimum energy subspace ( crmes )  @xcite appropriately adapted to the study of systems with complicated free - energy landscapes , such as the random - field ising model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we impose periodic boundary conditions on square lattices with linear sizes @xmath36 in the range @xmath37 and simulate relatively large ensembles of @xmath38 disorder realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> each disorder realization is repeatedly simulated up to @xmath39 times with different initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in our implementation of the wang - landau repetition process thermal properties are calculated at two different wang - landau levels and this practice enabled us to estimate statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical errors of the wang - landau method ( wl - errors ) used for the estimation of thermal and magnetic properties of a particular realization were found much smaller than the statistical errors coming from the fact that we used , for disorder averaging , a finite number of @xmath38 realizations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the wl - errors are not shown in our graphs , since in all cases , they are much smaller than the symbol sizes , whereas the latter errors of `` finite disorder sampling '' ( fds - errors ) are considerable and are presented in all our figures as error bars . the mean values over disorder </S>",
    "<S> are denoted as @xmath40_{av}$ ] , the corresponding maxima as @xmath40^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] , and the individual maxima as @xmath41_{av}$ ] . since in our fitting attempts </S>",
    "<S> we have used mainly data from the peaks of the disorder averaged curves ( i.e. @xmath42^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] ) , their fds - errors are the relevant statistical errors and have been determined by two similar methods . </S>",
    "<S> using our runs , organized in @xmath39 groups of @xmath43 realizations for each lattice size , an application of the jackknife method  @xcite and a straightforward @xmath39-point variance calculation ( blocking method )  @xcite were undertaken using the corresponding @xmath39 peaks of the averaged curves , for all thermal and magnetic properties studied . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the jackknife method yields some reasonably conservative errors , that are about @xmath44 larger than the corresponding calculated standard deviations .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) simultaneous fitting of the pseudocritical temperatures of the average specific heat ( filled squares ) and magnetic susceptibility ( filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) log - log plot of the maxima of the average logarithmic derivatives defined in equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> linear fits are applied for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> error bars are explained in the text.,width=16 ]    these jackknife errors are shown as error bars in all our figures and have been used in all our fits . </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us point out that sample - to - sample fluctuations for the individual maxima ( such as @xmath46_{av}$ ] ) become very large with the lattice size . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the order - parameter follows reference  @xcite , using the four sublattice magnetizations : @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start the presentation of our results with the most striking effect of the bond randomness on the specific heat of the square saf model . in figure  [ fig:1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we contrast the size dependence of the specific heat maxima of the pure ( filled squares ) and the random bond model ( filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the specific heat maxima is clear for the disordered case , even for the smaller sizes shown and this behavior should be compared with the behavior of the specific heat of the above mentioned previous studies concerning the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will then be observed from these comparisons that , in full disagreement to our finding of a strong saturating specific heat for the saf @xmath18 model , in the case of the 2d random bond three - state potts model one obtains a still diverging behavior for disorder strengths @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50  @xcite and an increasing but progressively saturating behavior is obtained only for the very strong disorder @xmath51  @xcite . on the other hand , for the random bond saf @xmath18 model , </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from figure  [ fig:1 ] that the data of the average specific heat saturate to a value already from the size of @xmath52 and any small variation around this value is mainly coming from the fds - errors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the estimation of the ratio @xmath53 for this model is not possible from the specific heat data and the alternative route via the rushbrook relation will be implemented later .    in figure  [ fig:2](a ) </S>",
    "<S> we present the fss behavior of two pseudocritical temperatures of the model @xmath54^{\\ast}_{av}}$ ] , i.e. the temperatures corresponding to the average specific heat ( @xmath55 : filled squares ) and the average magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath56 : filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines show a simultaneous fit on both data according to the relation @xmath57^{\\ast}_{av}}=t_{c}+bl^{-1/\\nu},\\ ] ] giving @xmath58 for the critical temperature of the disordered model , which is to be compared with the corresponding critical temperature @xmath59 of the pure system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value for @xmath60/dof of the above fit , using the jackknife errors , is @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the values of @xmath60/dof for all our fits vary in the range @xmath62 . on the other hand , using the smaller simple standard deviation errors , one would obtain for @xmath60/dof values in the range @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the above ranges for the ratios @xmath60/dof reflect the goodness of our fits . </S>",
    "<S> one could also use the fss of the pseudocritical temperatures defined with the help of the average of the individual maxima of the specific heat and susceptibility , i.e. the @xmath64_{av}}$ ] , but this choice gives similar results and it is not shown here for brevity . </S>",
    "<S> a first estimation of the critical exponent @xmath4 of the correlation length is obtained from the above shift behavior and is @xmath65 , as illustrated in the graph . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative estimation of the exponent @xmath4 is attempted now from the fss analysis of the logarithmic derivatives of several powers of the order - parameter with respect to the temperature  @xcite @xmath66 which scale as @xmath67 with the system size . in figure  [ fig:2](b ) </S>",
    "<S> we consider in double logarithmic scale the size dependence of the first- ( filled squares ) , second- ( filled circles ) , and fourth - order ( filled triangles ) maxima of the average over the ensemble of realizations logarithmic derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines shown are corresponding linear fits whose slopes provide respectively estimates for @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates in figure  [ fig:2](b ) have an average for the correlation length exponent of the order of @xmath69 . combining all the above estimates we propose an error bound for @xmath4 of the order of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in comparison with its value of the pure model , the exponent @xmath4 for the disordered model shows an increase of the order of @xmath71 , reflecting the strong influence of the disorder on the thermal properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to point our here that , our estimate is in agreement with the inequality @xmath72 derived by chayes  @xcite for disordered systems .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) log - log plot of the average magnetization at the estimated critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the log - log plot of the maxima of the average absolute order - parameter derivative . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) log - lop plot of the size dependence of the maxima of the magnetic susceptibilities : @xmath73^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] ( filled squares ) and @xmath46_{av}$ ] ( filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> sample - to - sample fluctuations of @xmath46_{av}$ ] become much larger than the fds - errors of @xmath73^{\\ast}_{av}$].,width=16 ]    turning now the magnetic properties of the model we begin by presenting the behavior of the order - parameter at the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we present in figure  [ fig:3](a ) in a log - log scale the fss behavior of the average order - parameter at the estimated critical temperature @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the straight line shows a linear fit for @xmath45 with a slope of @xmath75 which is a first manifestation that the ratio @xmath7 has within error bars the value of the pure model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the inset of panel ( a ) we plot in a log - log plot the size dependence of the maxima of the average absolute order - parameter derivative , defined as @xmath76 which is expected to scale as @xmath77 with the system size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the slope of the straight line , which is again a linear fit for @xmath45 , provides the estimate @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate when combined with the value for @xmath69 gives a value for @xmath7 of the order of @xmath79 and using the earlier error bounds for @xmath4 we propose again an error bound of the order of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two estimations are self - consistent and our results indicate that although the exponent @xmath5 increases in the disordered case , the ratio @xmath7 remains unchanged to its pure value , i.e. @xmath80  @xcite . in the sequel , </S>",
    "<S> we show in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:3 ] the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility of the model in order to provide estimates for the ratio @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we present two data points : the filled squares refer to the the maxima of the average curve @xmath73^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] , while the filled circles to the average of the individual maxima @xmath46_{av}$ ] . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the error bars shown reflect the sample - to - sample fluctuations , which are , as already pointed out , larger than the fds - errors of the corresponding averaged curves and of course much larger than the statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> the solid and dotted lines are linear fits for @xmath73^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] and @xmath46_{av}$ ] respectively , giving the values @xmath81 and @xmath82 , thus providing convincing evidence that @xmath83  @xcite , i.e. the ratio @xmath8 maintains the value of the pure model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the disordered square saf model appear to be the same with the corresponding ratios of the pure square saf model but different from those of the 2d three - state potts model . therefore , our results reinforce both the weak universality scenario for the pure saf model , as first predicted by binder and landau  @xcite , as well as the generalized statement of weak universality in the presence of bond randomness , given by kim  @xcite and concerning also the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , as discussed above , it is not possible to directly estimate the specific heat exponent from fss of the specific heat data . yet , </S>",
    "<S> having estimated the values for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 , we may estimate @xmath3 using either the rushbrook ( @xmath84 ) or equivalently , since @xmath85 , the hyperscaling ( @xmath86 ) relation . </S>",
    "<S> both relations provide a negative value for the specific heat exponent @xmath87 , reflecting the early saturation effect . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath3 differs significantly from the values estimated for relevant , and even stronger , to ours randomness strength for the 2d random bond potts ferromagnet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may attribute this strongly saturating behavior of the specific heat to the competitive nature of interactions which is supposedly responsible for the observed sensitivity of the saf model to bond randomness , since the disorder effects in this case are much more dramatic in comparison with the effects observed in other 2d models with simple ferromagnetic interactions , such as the 2d three - state potts ferromagnet  @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the wang - landau algorithm to investigate the interesting effects caused by the presence of quenched bond randomness on the critical behavior of the square ising model with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions . using standard finite - size scaling techniques , on high accuracy numerical data , </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the critical temperature of the disordered model to be well below the value of the corresponding pure model and we have extracted values for all critical exponents of the random bond square saf model . </S>",
    "<S> these values verify hyperscaling and also satisfy the chayes inequality  @xcite and the weak universality scenario for disordered systems , as stated by kim  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed unusual strong saturating behavior of the specific heat with a negative exponent @xmath3 , distinguishes the present case of competing interactions from other 2d random bond systems studied previously . </S>"
