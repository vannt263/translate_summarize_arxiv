    "as we eagerly await the coming operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , many in the collider phenomenology community are actively scrutinizing what we will be able to learn from such a machine .",
    "the tev energy scale appears extremely likely to contain yet undiscovered physics .",
    "the fact that the higgs mass is quadratically sensitive to new physics suggests that , in order to satisfy constraints from electroweak precision measurements , some kind of new physics must provide a cutoff to these contributions near the tev scale .",
    "the most studied of these possibilities is that of low energy supersymmetry , in which the quadratic divergences from the particles of the standard model are canceled by their superpartners , with masses below or not far above 1 tev .",
    "alternatively , so - called little higgs theories have been proposed to stabilize the higgs mass though collective symmetry breaking @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the only contributions to the higgs mass occur through diagrams involving multiple couplings in the theory , and thus are limited to the 2-loop level and higher . much like as in supersymmetry , little higgs models contain new particles near the tev scale .",
    "although the precise particle content of little higgs theories varies from model to model , they generically contain new gauge bosons , scalars and fermions , each of which have masses near or below 1 tev @xcite .",
    "another interesting class of new phenomena at the tev scale is the appearance of kaluza - klein modes , in particular within the context of models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) @xcite . in such models ,",
    "all of the fields of the standard model are free to propagate in the bulk of extra dimensional space , which is compactified to a radius of @xmath1 tev@xmath2 .",
    "particles traveling through the higher dimensionality of space appear to four dimensional observers as heavy copies of standard model particles  kaluza - klein modes .",
    "if any of these frameworks are manifest in nature , the lhc will be very likely to discover a number of new particles , whether superpartners , little higgs partners , or kaluza - klein states . despite the ability of the lhc to detect such particles , however , it is not at all clear that it will be able to determine enough about their detailed properties to distinguish between these various theories .",
    "in particular , a critical confirmation of supersymmetry would be to determine that the newly discovered particles are of differing spin from their standard model counterparts .",
    "if the spins of newly discovered particles are not determined at the lhc , it will be difficult to distinguish whether they are in fact superparticles , or other entities , such as kaluza - klein states , for example .",
    "the problem of distinguishing superpartners from kaluza - klein states at the lhc has been given quite some attention recently , in particular within the context of ued  @xcite .",
    "determining spins using the lepton charge asymmetry is a promising technique  @xcite , but appears to fail in the case of a quasi - degenerate spectrum of the sort expected in ued models @xcite .",
    "level 2 kaluza - klein modes could potentially be discovered at the lhc if they are lighter than about 2 tev .",
    "such a detection would bolster the case for ued , although a second kaluza - klein photon or @xmath3-boson could also be confused with a @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similar challenges would be expected for distinguishing supersymmetry from little higgs scenarios .",
    "if superpartners , little higgs partners or kaluza - klein modes are light enough to be studied at a future linear collider , the problem of distinguishing these scenarios will become much easier  @xcite . until that time",
    ", however , understanding the findings of the lhc will likely be quite challenging .    given the challenges involved in distinguishing between the various varieties of new physics that may be discovered at the lhc , it is important to consider other experimental discriminators that will likely be available .",
    "in particular , supersymmetry , ued and little higgs scenarios can each provide a stable , weakly - interacting particle , suitable as a dark matter candidate .",
    "a wide range of dark matter experiments have been developed to search for such particles @xcite .",
    "these efforts include direct dark matter experiments which attempt to observe the elastic scatterings of wimps with nuclei in a detector , and indirect detection efforts which search for the products of wimp annihilations , including neutrinos , gamma - rays and anti - matter .",
    "the signatures in direct and indirect dark matter experiments depend on the particle nature of the wimp being studied . in this paper , we focus on three specific particle dark matter candidates :    * for the case of supersymmetry , we consider the lightest neutralino , @xmath5 , within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we assume that r - parity is conserved , and do not introduce any cp - violating phases . * for the case of ued ,",
    "we consider the 5-dimensional case , and study the first kk excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "although we do not we d ourselves to a specific kk spectrum , we assume that radiative corrections do not radically alter the quasi - degenerate spectrum which is generally expected @xcite .",
    "we also assume that kk - parity is conserved . * in little higgs theories",
    ", we consider the t - parity conserving model of cheng and low  @xcite . for our dark matter candidate",
    ", we consider the lightest new heavy neutral gauge boson , @xmath7 .",
    "while each of these scenarios can yield a particle with the features required of a dark matter candidate ( the mass and annihilation cross section needed to generate the observed relic abundance , for example ) , their footprints in dark matter experiments may be sufficiently distinctive to provide substantial discriminating power . in this article",
    ", we explore the ability of direct and indirect dark matter experiments to distinguish a neutralino from a stable little higgs gauge boson or a kaluza - klein dark matter state .",
    "we find that in many cases , dark matter observations can effectively differentiate between supersymmetry , little higgs and ued models .",
    "direct dark matter detection experiments , such as cdms @xcite , zeplin @xcite , edelweiss @xcite , cresst @xcite , xenon @xcite and warp @xcite , are designed to detect dark matter particles through their elastic scattering with nuclei .",
    "although wimps scatter with nuclei through scalar ( spin - independent ) and axial - vector ( spin - dependent ) interactions , current direct detection experiments are far more sensitive to scalar interactions .",

    "@xmath33 whereas for down - type quarks : @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the higgs mixing angle .    for the case of kaluza - klein dark matter , @xmath6 ,",
    "the coupling is given by @xcite : @xmath36 corresponding to contributions from kk quark exchange , and higgs exchange diagrams , respectively . the first term in this expression",
    "is only included for the light quarks ( @xmath37 ) , while the second term contributes for both light and heavy species .",
    "finally , in the little higgs case , the coupling is given by @xcite : @xmath38 although this is similar to the ued case , the standard model hypercharge values are replaced with the hypercharge of the left - handed copy of the standard model quarks , @xmath39 . additionally , the mass splitting between the @xmath7 and @xmath40 are generally larger than between the @xmath6 and @xmath41 in ued , leading to further suppression .",
    "for these reasons , scattering in ued is generally dominated by kk quark exchange , while in little higgs models , the higgs exchange contribution is typically larger .    although the complete expression for the neutralino s elastic scattering cross section is rather complicated , there are a few simple limiting cases of particular interest .",
    "first , the largest cross sections are found in the case of large @xmath42 and light @xmath43 , and are the result of @xmath44 exchange , coupled to down - type quarks . for a bino or higgsino - like neutralino and @xmath45 , this contribution is approximately given by @xcite : @xmath46 if @xmath44 is heavy and/or @xmath42 is small , @xmath47 exchange can dominate . the contribution from @xmath47 exchange",

    "firstly , the contribution from higgs exchange in the ued and little higgs cases can be approximately related to the contribution from light higgs ( @xmath47 ) exchange in supersymmetry by : @xmath55 so , even if heavy higgs ( @xmath44 ) exchange is negligible , we expect a larger cross section in supersymmetry than in the case of ued or little higgs dark matter unless @xmath56 is light and/or the lightest neutralino is a highly pure bino or higgsino .",
    "of course if @xmath42 has a large or moderate value and @xmath43 is not very heavy , then @xmath44 exchange will dominate over @xmath47 exchange for neutralino scattering , leading to an even larger ratio than found in eq .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "we can imagine that this conclusion could be modified in the case of kaluza - klein dark matter if the splittings between the kk quark masses and the lkp mass were very small .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev , for example , the contribution to the elastic scattering cross section from kk exchange becomes comparable to that from higgs exchange , leading to a somewhat smaller ratio of approximately @xmath59 .",
    "to further study the case of neutralino dark matter , we have performed a scan over the following supersymmetric parameters : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , sfermion masses , @xmath62 , @xmath42 and the trilinear couplings .",
    "each of the masses was allowed to be as large as 4 tev , and @xmath42 as large as 60 .",
    "the range of neutralino masses and spin - independent elastic scattering cross sections with nucleons found in this scan are shown as a shaded region in fig .",
    "this region shows the range of models found which do not violate any direct collider constraints , violate the constraints on the @xmath63 branching fraction , and do not overproduce the abundance of neutralino dark matter , as measured by wmap @xcite . from this scan ,",
    "we find that the neutralino - nucleon cross section can vary by more than 10 orders of magnitude . the lower bound to this result is largely a consequence of the maximum values we have allowed @xmath61 and the squark masses to take on in our parameter scan .",
    "models with larger ( and more unnatural ) values of @xmath61 and/or squark masses would be expected to have even smaller elastic cross sections than shown in the figure .    in fig .",
    "[ dir ] , we also show the spin - independent elastic scattering cross sections of wimps in ued and little higgs models .",
    "as expected , the results are somewhat different than in the case of neutralino dark matter . for the case of ued ,",
    "we have plotted ( as thick solid lines ) rather extreme cases .",
    "the lowest most curve uses kk quark masses 30% larger than the lkp mass and a higgs mass as large as is allowed by electroweak precision data ( varying from @xmath64 gev for @xmath65 gev to @xmath66 gev for @xmath67 tev ) @xcite .",
    "the middle curve was calculated using kk quark masses 10% larger than the lkp mass and a higgs mass as low as is allowed by electroweak precision data ( varying from @xmath64 gev for @xmath65 gev to @xmath68 gev for @xmath69 gev ) @xcite .",
    "these two curves can be thought of as reasonable upper and lower limits to the spin - independent elastic scattering cross section of the @xmath6 with nucleons .",
    "if we imagine that the kk quarks might be even more degenerate with the lkp , then the cross section could be somewhat larger .",
    "the upper thick solid line again uses the minimum possible higgs mass , but only a 5% splitting between the kk quark and lkp masses .    the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath7 in t - parity conserving little higgs models",
    "are shown as dotted lines in fig .",
    "the upper line is for the case of @xmath40 5% heavier than @xmath7 and a higgs mass of 114 gev .",
    "the lower line is for the case of a heavy ( decoupled ) @xmath40 and a 1 tev higgs mass .",
    "considering the range of possible cross sections we have calculated in these models , we see that in some cases it may be possible to use the rate in a direct dark matter detection experiment to differentiate supersymmetry from ued or little higgs scenarios . in many supersymmetric models , for example ,",
    "planned direct dark matter detection experiments will measure an elastic scattering cross section above the range predicted in ued or little higgs models .",
    "in particular , supersymmetric models with large @xmath42 or light @xmath43 generally produce direct detection rates above the range possible in ued or little higgs theories .",
    "also , neutralinos with a mixed gaugino - higgsino composition can often generate very high direct detection rates .",
    "on the other hand , there is a range of cross sections in which these models will not be distinguishable by direct detection experiments alone . in many of these models , however , combining information from direct and indirect dark matter experiments can enable one to discriminate between supersymmetry , ued and little higgs theories .",

    "@xcite .    in both the ued and little higgs cases , the prospects for dark matter detection with positrons",
    "is enhanced by the fact that s - wave annihilation terms dominate the freeze - out process ( @xmath133 constant ) .",
    "this means that the entire annihilation cross section of the wimp at freeze - out will also be present in the low velocity limit , leading to @xmath138 @xmath132/s in most cases , in the absence of coannihilations .",
    "this can also be the case for neutralinos , although this depends on which annihilation channels dominate .",
    "annihilation diagrams through cp - odd higgs exchange , for example , generate s - wave contributions , while processes such as annihilation through sfermion exchange can lead to @xmath139 .",
    "dark matter annihilations in high density regions could potentially result in an observable flux of gamma - rays .",

    "satellite - based ( glast @xcite ) and ground - based ( hess @xcite , magic @xcite , and veritas @xcite ) experiments have been designed to search for such a signal .",
    "the differential flux of gamma - rays produced by dark matter annihilation can be written as ,    = _ los ^2(l ) dl , [ flux2 ] where @xmath140 is dark matter mass , @xmath141 is thermally averaged dark matter self - annihilation cross section , @xmath142 is the density of dark matter , and the integral is performed over the line - of - sight .",

    "neutralinos generally annihilate through @xmath109 channel only a few percent of the time or less , however .",
    "regardless of the supersymmetric parameters used , the continuum gamma - ray emission from neutralino dark matter annihilation will be indistinguishable from the spectrum from heavy quarks or gauge / higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "similarly , little higgs dark matter annihilate predominantly into @xmath147 and @xmath3 pairs @xcite , and thus can not be distinguished from neutralinos from the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "kaluza - klein dark matter , in contrast , annihilates dominantly to charged leptons pairs ( 20%25% to each generation ) .",
    "this leads to a harder gamma - ray spectrum than from supersymmetric or little higgs dark matter due to the role of tau decays , and final state radiation .",

    "n - body simulations suggest that dense cusps should be present in such objects , although observations allow for a wide range of possible densities .",
    "baryonic effects , in particular , may lead to the destruction of a dark matter cusp in the center of our galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", the effects of adiabatic compression @xcite or the adiabatic accretion of dark matter onto the center supermassive black hole @xcite could lead to extremely high densities in the inner galaxy .    for the case of the center of our galaxy , we consider two possible dark matter distributions , known as the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) @xcite and moore _ et al .",

    "given the challenges involved with observing dark matter in the galactic center , we will also consider the possibility of detecting gamma - rays from dark matter annihilations in a class of companion galaxies of the milky way , called dwarf spheroidals @xcite .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are highly dark matter dominated , and are not expected to produce significant backgrounds in their inner regions .",
    "draco is one of the closest and most massive dwarf galaxies , and even though it is not expected to be the brightest gamma - ray source among them , its dark matter density profile is the most tightly constrained by observations , which makes it an interesting candidate for gamma - ray detection .",

    "the usefulness of this channel will depend critically on the unknown local dark matter annihilation rate . * the neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections can , for some parameters , be larger than is found in either ued or little higgs models . if such a large cross section is observed , it would strongly disfavor ued and little higgs scenarios . on the other hand ,",
    "if a smaller cross section is measured in future direct detection experiments , it could not easily be used to distinguish between these scenarios ( see fig .  [ dir ] ) .",
    "* the flux of neutrinos from dark matter annihilations in the sun is very large in the case of ued .",

    "the neutrino flux from supersymmetric dark matter can vary over this entire range of possibilities ( see fig .",
