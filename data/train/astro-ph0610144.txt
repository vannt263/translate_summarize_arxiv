    "magnetic fields are believed to play a key role in the dynamics of the gas of the galaxy , including the formation of stars and related phenomena .",
    "dispersions in the molecular velocities are observed that exceed the thermal dispersion , and are suggestive of turbulence .",
    "since the gas in astronomical environments tends to have high electrical conductivity , the turbulence is expected to be `` mhd turbulence'' with correlated irregularities between the velocity fields , the magnetic fields , and the matter distributions .",
    "inferences about the structure of the magnetic fields in the interstellar medium are based mostly on polarimetric observations of the attenuation of starlight by dust and of the thermal emission by dust , and tend to reflect the results of averaging over dimensions larger than those at which mhd turbulence may be evident .",
    "@xcite recognized that , if anisotropies in the optical depths do occur for the spectral lines of molecules in the interstellar gas , they could cause a fractional linear polarization of a few percent in the observed spectral line radiation .",
    "more importantly , the direction of the polarization would indicate the projected direction of the magnetic field , and would serve to map the directions of the magnetic field lines .",
    "@xcite perform calculations for anisotropic optical depths due to assumed anisotropies in the molecular velocities .",
    "no specific cause for the anisotropic velocities is given by @xcite .",
    "anisotropic optical depths could clearly have various origins  including , simply the proximity of the edge of the gas cloud .",
    "the anisotropy due to a strong source of continuum radiation external to the gas cloud could also have a similar effect in causing linear polarization of the spectral line radiation emitted by the gas .",
    "the first effort to detect this polarization was unsuccessful .",
    "@xcite attempted to measure the linear polarization of thermal lines of co , cs , and hcn in 14 sources .",
    "although , their upper limits were above the maximum likely polarization calculated for the co lines , these upper limits were below ( by factors of a few ) the maximum likely polarizations calculated for the cs and hcn lines .",
    "@xcite attributed the lack of observed polarization to the unresolved structure of the magnetic and/or velocity field .",
    "however , @xcite subsequently searched for polarization in an nh@xmath1 line at higher resolution using the vla  also without success .",
    "further , no polarization was detected for hco@xmath2 lines by @xcite in four dark clouds , with an upper limit of 2% .",
    "@xcite attempted to measure the polarization of hco@xmath2 lines in dr  21 , but also obtained only an upper limit ( 0.4% ) .",
    "again , the absence of detectable polarization was attributed to likely unresolved structure of the magnetic / velocity fields on scales smaller than the telescope beamsize .    stimulated by these non - detections",
    ", @xcite performed multilevel calculations that included states of higher angular momentum and demonstrated that the polarization of a ( 10 ) transition is reduced by about a factor of two .",
    "this and other considerations discussed by @xcite reduce the expected polarization of the thermal lines to near the upper limits of 12% from the non - detections cited above .",
    "the linear polarization of thermal lines was finally detected by @xcite .",
    "polarization of a spectral line of molecular cs was detected at a level of a few percent toward two evolved stars .",
    "@xcite argued that this success was a result of improved detector sensitivity and by the relatively smooth structure of the gas in the vicinity of the evolved star ",
    "in contrast to the clumpiness of gas in star forming regions .",
    "linear polarization of thermal spectral lines from the interstellar gas was subsequently detected by @xcite .",
    "the co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) transitions in three different locations were found to have polarizations ranging from 0.5% to 2.4% .",
    "the detection toward the dr  21 star forming region was tentative , but was later confirmed by @xcite for dr  21(oh ) . at this time ,",
    "polarization of thermal co lines has also been detected ( or confirmed ) in the star forming regions ngc  1333 @xcite , ngc  2024 @xcite , the galactic center @xcite , and the orion kl region @xcite .",
    "@xcite report the striking observation that the polarizations of the co ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) transitions tend to be orthogonal in dr  21(oh ) , with the polarization of the ( 1 - 0 ) being parallel to the polarization of the emission by the dust grains",
    ".    the polarization of the spectral lines of molecules may be useful as a diagnostic , not only for the magnetic fields themselves , but also for the mhd nature of the gas .",
    "one of the prominent features of mhd turbulence is its strong anisotropy @xcite , which will enhance the magnitude of the optical depths of spectral lines parallel to the magnetic field in comparison with the optical depths perpendicular to the magnetic field @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we considered oh maser radiation that is created in the presence of mildly supersonic mhd turbulence .",
    "we showed that this anisotropy in the maser optical depths resulting from the anisotropy of mhd turbulent velocities can suppress the zeeman @xmath0-components of mainline oh masers as observed  a longstanding puzzle , dating back to the first detections of masers in astronomy .",
    "maser radiation probes ( at least directly ) only the tiny fraction of the entire volume of a region in which maser spots are observed .",
    "in contrast , thermal spectral lines of molecules tend to be observed over most of the volume of molecular gas clouds .",
    "there is less doubt than for masers that the information obtained from these spectral lines is representative of a significant component of the gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of anisotropic optical depths are much more easily recognized for the oh mainline masers because the zeeman @xmath0- and @xmath3-components of these spectral lines are well separated in frequency from one another and can ordinarily be identified as @xmath3 s or ( if they were present ) @xmath0 s . for spectral lines of other interstellar molecules ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is much less than the spectral linebreadth .",
    "the zeeman components then overlap nearly completely and are essentially indistinguishable from one another . nevertheless , an anisotropy in the optical depths is the origin of the goldreich - kylafis effect and , though its effect is small , can be detected .",
    "the goal of this paper is to assess whether the anisotropy of plausible mhd turbulence is sufficient to cause the observed linear polarization of the spectral lines of co from interstellar gas clouds that is observed . in our calculation for the oh masers , it was only necessary to integrate through a gas in which the molecular populations are independently specified in order to obtain the intensities of the maser rays .",
    "calculating the polarization of the thermal lines of co is more challenging .",
    "the populations of the magnetic substates must first be found by solving rate equations with the anisotropic fluxes derived from the anisotropic optical depths .    in   2 , we calculate the velocity gradients within representative examples of turbulent mhd gas that are obtained from numerical simulations of decaying turbulence and demonstrate the anisotropy as a function of the relevant parameter here  the ratio of the alfvn velocity to the sound speed of the gas .",
    "the existing calculational methods for the goldreich - kylafis effect must be augmented somewhat because of the variation in the properties of the gas from point to point , which we wish to consider .",
    "we describe how the calculations are performed in   3 .",
    "calculations are performed , not only for the average polarization , but also to indicate how the polarization can change in direction and magnitude across the face of a gas cloud and across the profile of the spectral line .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in   4 .",
    "a summarizing discussion is provided in   5 where we relate the results here to our previous calculations for the polarization of continuum emission from dust grains aligned by irregular magnetic fields .",
    "our quantitative analysis of the anisotropy is based on a numerical model of decaying mhd turbulence .",
    "we use the same results of simulations as were used in @xcite .",
    "only a brief description of these simulations is provided here , and we refer the reader to the earlier paper and to references therein for details . velocity fields and magnetic fields were obtained there by integrating the equations of compressible , ideal mhd turbulence in a cubic , periodic domain on a uniform grid with @xmath4 cells .",
    "the key parameter that characterizes these simulations is the ratio of the alfvn velocity to the speed of sound @xmath5 .",
    "this alfvn velocity is calculated from the average magnetic field in the mhd cube  which remains constant during the time evolution of the simulation .",
    "three values of @xmath5 are considered1 , 3 and 10 .",
    "as is standard for such simulations , the computations begin with plausible , initial velocity perturbations and evolve with time . to verify that our conclusions do not depend upon a particular statistical choice for these initial perturbations , computations were performed for three independent choices for these initial velocity perturbations for each of the values of @xmath5 . in these simulations ,",
    "the turbulent velocities evolve from supersonic ( mach number @xmath6 ) to subsonic ( @xmath7 ) . for each combination of initial perturbations and value for @xmath5",
    ", we have analyzed the fields at nine time steps separated in time by intervals of @xmath8where @xmath9 is the physical length to be associated with the 128 grid points along the edge of the computational cube .",

    "the length is measured in units of the number of grid cells .",
    "the subscripts @xmath11 or @xmath12 indicate directions parallel or perpendicular to the average magnetic field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    anisotropy in the optical depths of spectral lines in an mhd gas has already been demonstrated in @xcite . here",
    "we delineate the anisotropy of the medium more explicitly and in more detail .",
    "there are different , approximate ways to characterize this anisotropy .",
    "we might assume that , in a supersonically turbulent medium , only the nearby region influences the populations at a given location so that the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation is appropriate .",
    "at each of the grid points of the mhd cubes , the anisotropy can then be visualized in terms of the angular distribution of the radial ( relative to the location of the particular grid point ) gradients of the radial component of the turbulent velocity @xmath13 to examine the anisotropy in this approximation , we compute these gradients ( using linear interpolations of velocities at neighboring locations ) at a large number of grid points and in a large number of directions at each grid point . to simplify the computations , we only consider directions at each grid point that lie within a single plane .",
    "a plane is specified as containing the direction of the average magnetic field and the particular grid point .",
    "the planes associated with the various grid points are all parallel . the results for all grid points are then combined to obtain averaged gradients that are a function of the angle of inclination relative to the direction of the average magnetic field in the cube .",
    "these gradients are presented in figure  [ butterfly ] ( top panel ) for the three representative time steps and for the three values of @xmath5 that we consider .",
    "the gradients in figure  [ butterfly ] are based on only a single sequence of time steps ( resulting from one of the three ensembles of initial perturbations ) for each of the values of @xmath5 .",
    "for the same @xmath5 and the same time step , the averaged gradients for the other mhd cubes differ negligibly from those that are presented .    in a statistical sense , the properties of such mhd cubes should be symmetric about the direction of the average magnetic field .",
    "the curves in figure  [ butterfly ] deviate slightly from this exact symmetry because they are based on only a single mhd cube , and hence , on only a single ensemble of initial perturbations .",
    "the direction of the average magnetic field is parallel to the horizontal axis in figure  [ butterfly ] .",
    "as expected , the velocity gradients are smallest in directions parallel to the magnetic field and largest in directions that are at large angles to the magnetic field .",
    "the angular variations of the gradients in figure  [ butterfly ] can be seen to be similar at all times in the simulation for a specific value of @xmath5 . in decaying turbulence ,",
    "the turbulent velocities decrease with time , and hence the magnitudes of these gradients also decrease .",
    "anisotropy is clearly evident in figure  [ butterfly ] for @xmath14 and 10 , though not for @xmath15 .",
    "note that the magnitudes of the velocity gradients in figure  [ butterfly ] are given in terms of the thermal velocity of the gas @xmath10 ( @xmath16)the thermal velocity of the dominant atomic or molecular component of the gas .",
    "the gas is mainly h@xmath17 in the astronomical environments where our calculations are expected to be applied and the molecules such as co from which the spectral line radiation of interest arises are much heavier than h@xmath17 .",
    "hence , the numerical values of the velocity gradients in figure  [ butterfly ] ( top panel ) should be divided , for example , by the ratio ( co mass / h@xmath17 mass)@xmath18 to obtain the quantities that are relevant for the radiative transport of the spectral lines of the co molecule in the lvg approximation ( see , e.g. , equation [ lomega ] ) .",
    "note also that the dimensionless distance scale is the separation between grid points so that the gradients in figure  [ butterfly ] should be divided by ( @xmath19 ) to express them in terms of ordinary units for distance .    in a turbulent medium",
    ", we may expect that some remote points ( as well as the nearby points ) contribute to the average intensity of radiation at a given location and thus , influence the populations at this location .",
    "in contrast , in the lvg approximation where only ` local ' interactions are considered , the extent of the region that influences the populations at a given location is assumed to be proportional to the inverse of the velocity gradient .",
    "that is , in the lvg approximation the ` interaction length ' is assumed to be the distance over which the velocity would change by @xmath10 in a given direction if its gradient were constant along this direction . in order to characterize the non - local , radiative coupling of the molecular populations and to see whether the anisotropy is preserved in the ` non - local ' case as well ,",
    "we introduce ` effective ' interaction lengths @xmath20 ,   \\label{leff}\\ ] ] which are computed in particular directions from the specified location . here",
    "@xmath21 is the component of the local turbulent velocity in the direction of the integration path , @xmath22 is this component of the turbulent velocity at a distance @xmath23 from the relevant point , and the factor 14 is the ratio of molecular masses co / h@xmath17 . in the local case ,",
    "the interaction length is defined by the velocity gradient and all locations along the length of the ray have equal weight . in the non - local case",
    ", we define a length @xmath24 of a ray along which the optical depths are to be calculated .",
    "locations along this ray have different weights as determined by the gaussian profile function in the integrand of equation ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "the cube - averaged , angular distributions of @xmath25 are also shown in figure  [ butterfly ] ( bottom panel ) for the choice @xmath26 grid spacings . again",
    ", there is almost no anisotropy in the @xmath15 case , whereas the anisotropy is evident in the plots for the @xmath14 and 10 cases . since the interaction length is similar to the inverse of the velocity gradient , it is the largest in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the size of the interaction region increases with time as the velocity dispersion in the cube decreases .",
    "the degree of anisotropy also increases somewhat . despite the smooth appearance of the averaged curves ,",
    "there are significant irregularities at individual locations as we will show in ",
    "just as for the average velocity gradients , the interaction lengths in figure  [ butterfly ] are not exactly symmetric about the direction of the average magnetic field because figure  [ butterfly ] is based on the evolution of an individual mhd cube .",
    "the goal here is to calculate the linear polarization of spectral line radiation that emerges from a gas cloud with irregular magnetic and velocity fields represented by the mhd fields from the simulations described above .",
    "the focus is on incorporating the variations in the fields from location to location within the gas . that is , instead of using a single , averaged angular distribution for the entire cube ( such as those in figure [ butterfly ] ) to represent the anisotropy caused by the magnetic fields and velocities in the gas , we calculate the relevant angular distribution at each grid point using the actual magnetic fields and velocities from the simulations at the particular grid point .",
    "in addition to being more realistic , this will allow us to assess what differences in the polarization characteristics can be expected for radiation that emerges from different locations on the surface of a gas cloud .",
    "the calculations are performed for the specific case of the @xmath27 rotational transition of the co molecule with the usual assumption that the results will be indicative for other transitions .",
    "the radiative transfer equations for the stokes parameters are integrated through the cube for specific rays of spectral line radiation that emerge from the mhd cube and represent the observed radiation . for a @xmath27 transition with a resonant frequency @xmath28 ,",
    "these can be expressed as @xmath29 \\phi ( \\nu -\\nu _ { 0}\\frac{v_{s}}{c } ) ,   \\label{transfer}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the normalized , gaussian line profile caused by the doppler shifts associated with a thermal distribution of molecular velocities , @xmath32 is the line - of - sight component of the turbulent velocity at the location @xmath33 along the ray , and the absorption coefficients and source functions ( @xmath34 ) are obtained from the populations of the magnetic substates .",
    "explicit expressions for ( @xmath34 ) can be found e.g. , in @xcite [ but see @xcite for some typographical corrections ] .",
    "the populations @xmath35 of the magnetic substates at a particular location along a ray are found by solving the usual rate equations in steady state @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the einstein `` a - coefficient '' for spontaneous emission , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) refer to the magnetic substates of the upper @xmath42 and lower @xmath43 energy levels , respectively . in writing the above equations , the quantization axis and the axis for defining the polarizations are both assumed to be along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this simplification is appropriate when the zeeman splitting is much less than the inverse lifetime of the excited molecular state ",
    "a requirement that is well satisfied for co and most molecules in the interstellar gas .",
    "while the average magnetic field is always parallel to one of the sides of the cube , the local magnetic field fluctuates around this average direction .",
    "thus , in solving equations ( [ transfer ] ) and ( [ pops ] ) , it is necessary to transform stokes @xmath44 and @xmath45 by a coordinate rotation at each grid point so that they are defined relative to the direction of the local magnetic field .",
    "note also that the circular polarization is assumed to be negligible .",
    "circular polarization is negligible when the zeeman splitting is much less than the spectral linebreadth and the fractional linear polarization is small .",
    "we will find the intensities to be used in calculating the @xmath46 by two separate methods .",
    "both are approximate and , especially for the second method , are in the spirit of approximations introduced recently by others @xcite .",

    "the intensities at each grid point must be determined in a large number of directions to perform the integration over angles .",
    "so that the calculations are manageable for us , we make the approximation that the populations that enter into the calculation of the intensities for the @xmath46 are the same as at the specific grid point for which the @xmath46 are being calculated .",
    "then , stokes @xmath47 is zero for the intensities that enter into the @xmath46 , and the @xmath46 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "to apply the approximation it must be assumed that the turbulence creates large , macroscopic velocity variations in most parts of a cube , and hence that remote points of the gas do not interact significantly with each other through the emission and absorption of spectral line radiation .",

    "explicit expressions for the polarized intensities in the lvg approximation can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .    in the second approximate method  which we designate as the non - local approximation , we take into account possible radiative coupling between distant points .",

    "since the mhd simulations adopt periodic boundary conditions , we use the periodicity to extend the mhd cube when necessary so that all integrals for the @xmath68 can be computed for @xmath69 . just as in the first ( the lvg ) approximate method ,",
    "the rate equations are then solved iteratively to find the populations @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that equation ( [ formal ] ) must be solved in detail at each point in this non - local approximation for a number of frequencies @xmath72 ( typically , 31 and up to 91 in some test cases ) , as well as angles @xmath53 ( typically , 600 at each grid point ) , to perform the integrations in equations ( [ r0 ] ) and ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the non - local method requires considerably more effort than does the lvg approximation , for which a detailed calculation at a number of frequencies is not required .",
    "the populations at the grid points of the mhd cube obtained with either the first or the second method described above are then used in the radiative transfer equation ( [ transfer ] ) , which is integrated to obtain the intensities for a number of parallel rays that pass through the mhd cube and emerge at the locations of grid points on the surface .",

    "we have verified that , as expected , no significant polarization is produced in our calculations when the line of sight is parallel to the average magnetic field ( the polarization is not exactly zero because of the irregularities in the magnetic field ) .    once the specific mhd cube is selected , the calculations depend on only two additional quantities  the gas density and the average column density of co molecules through the cube @xmath74",

    "we tried other values for @xmath67 as well , ranging from approximately half the cube size to @xmath82 , and found that the fractional polarizations for specific rays are changed by no more than 30% .",

    "the dash - dotted line is obtained with the lvg approximation . ]    the overall dependence of the magnitude of the fractional polarization on the co column density is indicated in figure  [ pvstau ] . there , the fractional polarization at the peak intensity for the brightest ray of the ( 128)@xmath83 rays that emerge from the grid points on the face of the cube is shown .",
    "the maximum degree of polarization occurs at a column density of @xmath84  @xmath85 which at this density and temperature corresponds roughly to @xmath86the value usually assumed to be most favorable for the godreich - kylafis effect .",
    "optical depth enters into the expressions for the radiative rates @xmath46 in the rate equations , as well as in the integration of equation ( [ transfer ] ) along the line of sight for the emergent intensities .",
    "the curves in figure  [ pvstau ] are reminiscent of similar diagrams for the pure lvg computations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the fractional polarization is higher for the lower @xmath79 , reaching 3% at @xmath87 and 8% at @xmath80 for the strong magnetic field case .",
    "when the average magnetic field is lower , the fractional polarization also is smaller ( by about a factor of 2 here ) as expected , indicating less anisotropy in the medium .",
    "another manifestation of the increase in anisotropy with stronger average magnetic fields is provided by a comparison of the representative maps of the fractional polarization at the three values @xmath15 , 3 , and 10 for three representative time steps in the evolution of the turbulence ( figure  [ vecmapnl ] and [ vecmaplvg ] ) .",
    "the linear dimension of the cube is taken to be 0.12  pc , which corresponds to @xmath88  @xmath85 for the adopted values of @xmath89 and the assumed co abundance ( @xmath90 relative to h@xmath17 ) .",
    "we use this column density , which is an order of magnitude higher than the density that provides the highest fractional polarization ( see figure  [ pvstau ] ) , because it produces brighter lines .",
    "these lines will be more easily observable , and will still have appreciable fractional polarization .",
    "the figures differ in that the non - local approximation is used in figure  [ vecmapnl ] to calculate the molecular populations at each grid point whereas the lvg approximation is used to calculate the populations in figure  [ vecmaplvg ] . in the regime here where the zeeman shift is much greater than the collision rate @xmath77 or the radiative decay rate @xmath37 , the direction of the spectral line polarization that is generated at a grid point will tend to be either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field  at that grid point . whether the polarization is parallel or perpendicular is , in the absence of a strong external source of radiation , determined by the angle between the local velocity gradients and the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the appearance of the polarization maps is defined by both the magnetic field structure and the velocity field structure . since we know from figure  [ butterfly ] that the average velocity gradients are strongest perpendicular to the magnetic field , the preferred direction for the polarization vectors should be perpendicular to the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "relative to the direction of the average magnetic field , this is exactly what is seen in our computations . because of the turbulence",
    ", the actual magnetic fields at many grid points will be in directions that are different from the average .",
    "we might then expect that the direction of the polarization of the radiation that is generated at these grid points will be neither parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of the average magnetic field . as a result , polarization directions might be expected in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] that are neither exactly parallel or perpendicular to the average magnetic field in the cube , which is along the horizontal axes in the figures .",
    "that such polarization directions are not more common in these figures is then noteworthy  especially for @xmath15 where the variation in the directions of the local magnetic fields are greatest since the turbulent component of the magnetic field is strongest in comparison with the average magnetic field .",
    "values ( 1 , 3 , and 10 from left to right ) and time steps ( 3rd , 5th , and 9th from top to bottom , in units of @xmath91 ) obtained with the non - local approximation . the labels for the axes refer to directions parallel and perpendicular to the average magnetic field .",
    "the longest vector corresponds to the fractional polarization of 5.4% . each 16th ray in both directions",
    "a circle marks the ray , for which line profiles are shown in figure  [ prof015 ] . ]    , but obtained with the lvg approximation .",
    "the longest vector corresponds to the fractional polarization of 4.0% . ]",
    "a few trends are evident in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] .",
    "the fractional polarizations are greater in models with stronger magnetic fields , where we expect the anisotropy related to the mhd turbulence to be greatest .",
    "also , the pattern of the polarization directions is more regular in the models with the stronger magnetic fields . in the @xmath92 case",
    ", the polarization vectors do reflect the presence of the significant , irregular component of the magnetic field . in models with the stronger average magnetic fields",
    "( i.e. , larger @xmath73 ) , the only variations in the directions of the polarization that persist are at locations where the polarization directions are parallel to the average magnetic field , instead of perpendicular to it .",
    "the number of these polarization `` reversals''where the polarization direction is parallel rather than perpendicular to the average magnetic field  constitutes almost one third of the total number of rays that are considered for the non - local computations when @xmath93 , while only a few reversals are seen the @xmath94 case .",
    "also , in the latter case the number of reversals decreases with time .",
    "reversals indicate that , despite the general tendency for the velocity gradients to be perpendicular to the average direction of the magnetic field , there are some locations where they are mostly parallel to the average magnetic field .",
    "we have performed computations in which the irregularities in the magnetic fields ( but not in the velocities ) are artificially removed , and obtained essentially the same results .",
    "we thus conclude that the reversals are mainly due to the changes in direction of the velocity gradients .",
    "figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] do not agree well in detail on a point - by - point basis .",
    "the lvg maps are more regular , and have a smaller number of reversals .",
    "the profiles for the emergent intensities that are calculated for the lvg approximation and for the non - local approximation are somewhat different when the line is optically thin , even though they almost coincide when the column density exceeds @xmath95",
    "@xmath85 ( @xmath96 ) . while the stokes - q profiles for the two approximations are also similar at most locations , there are some points where the specific velocity structure causes the polarization vector to be parallel to the average magnetic field in the non - local case and perpendicular to it in the lvg case or vice versa .",
    "we nevertheless interpret the general agreement in the character and in the average magnitude of the polarization obtained with the two approximations as support for our working hypothesis that these approximate methods provide useful results .",
    "( 5th time step ) .",
    "profiles are presented for several values of the column density @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) of co molecules as indicated by the line types . ]",
    "( arbitrary units ) in the plane of the sky for two locations along the ray where the contributions to the polarization are orthogonal to one another .",
    "an arrow indicates the direction of the average magnetic field and @xmath99 is the distance along the ray measured from the far side of the cube . ]",
    "the two methods are further compared in figure  [ prof015 ] , where the line profiles for a single ray of radiation ( the intensity that emerges from a single grid point on the surface ) are given for several values of @xmath74 .",
    "the specific ray shown is the ray marked with a circle in figure  [ vecmapnl ] .",
    "this is one of the cases where the polarization vector ( representing the polarization at the peak of the intensity profile ) is parallel to the average magnetic field in the non - local case and perpendicular to it in the lvg case .",
    "this ray is , thus , not typical but instead represents a case where the differences between the results with the two approximate methods are greatest .",
    "the reason for this behavior is indicated in figure  [ tauphi ] , where we show the variations in the los component of the turbulent velocity along this ray .",
    "profiles for stokes-@xmath100 and @xmath101 of the emergent radiation are shown in figure  [ prof015 ] .",
    "the spectral line consists of two components with mutually perpendicular polarizations , as indicated by the sign of @xmath101 in bottom left panel ( in this paper , negative @xmath101 corresponds to polarization that is perpendicular to the direction of the average magnetic field ) .",
    "orthogonal polarizations originate in these two velocity components because of the detailed behavior of the velocity field along the ray .",
    "the component at the line - of - sight ( los ) velocities between about @xmath102 and @xmath103 which occurs at distances @xmath99 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 from the far side of the cube , has polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the component with los velocities near @xmath106 originates from gas at two locations along the ray , specifically , at @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the region at the far side of the cube generates emission that is polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field because the effective interaction length ( eq .  [ [ leff ] ] ) is largest there along the direction of the average magnetic field ( solid line in figure  [ tauphi]b ) .",
    "this is also the case in the intermediate part of the ray .",
    "consequently , the optical depth is larger along the magnetic field .",
    "this creates the necessary conditions for overpopulation of the @xmath109 substates , resulting in stronger @xmath3 transitions and hence polarization that is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "closer to the near surface of the cube , the structure of the velocity field changes so that the effective interaction length and the optical depth are greater in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( figure  [ tauphi]b ; dotted line ) .",
    "this causes overpopulation of the @xmath110 substate , enhanced @xmath0 transitions , and hence a net polarization that is parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "when the emergent radiation consists of two ( or more ) velocity components with different polarizations , the resultant polarization direction is determined by the stronger of the components . as the region with the `` wrong '' velocity structure occupies a shorter portion of the ray that does the region with the common velocity structure , it shows up as a polarization reversal only when the optical depth along the ray is sufficiently large**. * * that is , there are no reversals",
    "if @xmath74 is smaller than some critical value ( stokes - q is negative for all profiles with @xmath111  @xmath85 on bottom left panel of figure  [ prof015 ] ) . the number of reversals in a particular cube increases with increasing @xmath74 ( at the same time , the percentage polarization decreases ) . in the case of the ray in figure  [ tauphi ] , the angular distribution of @xmath25 shown with the dotted line in figure  [",
    "tauphi]b is only created when the radiative coupling with remote locations is taken into account .",
    "it is not evident from the angular distribution of the local velocity gradients .",
    "hence , the polarization reversal does not appear in the lvg approximation ( bottom right panel of figure  [ prof015 ] ) .",
    "the polarizations shown in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] are quite high .",
    "however , the vectors plotted in these maps represent single rays and do not reflect the possible effects of averaging over the finite size for the beam of a realistic telescope .",
    "realistic averaging may cause a cancellation of the polarization vectors and a decrease in the observed polarization percentage .",
    "such averaging may also lead to a disappearance of the reversals in polarization direction that are observed ( even for the strongest magnetic fields ) in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] .",
    "another concern is whether there is some substructure between the rays in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] that is being missed .",
    "we have thus computed higher resolution maps for selected , representative regions of the surfaces of the cubes .    in the upper left panel of figure",
    "[ hires ] , we present a high resolution map for the region centered on the reversed ray that is marked with a circle in figure  [ vecmapnl ] .",
    "the map shows the polarization vectors for all @xmath112 rays emerging from the region of @xmath112 grid points . in lower left panel of figure",
    "[ hires ] we show the same map , but averaged over rays within @xmath113 squares to simulate the effect of finite beam size .",
    "because the initial perturbations include wavelengths that are a significant fraction of @xmath9 , the regions exhibiting reversed polarizations can occur over an appreciable fraction of the surface of the cube , even in the case of the stronger magnetic field .",
    "their effect on the observational data will be reduced because of the finite size of the telescope beam , though the effects will tend to persist until the beam size reaches approximately @xmath114 . in the case of the stronger magnetic field ,",
    "the regions where these reversals occur are quite localized and beam averaging will not necessarily reduce the overall polarization when the telescope beam is centered on most locations on the surface of the mhd cube .    in the case of @xmath93 where the fraction of reversed polarization vectors is about one third , mutually perpendicular polarizations within one beam are common and the resulting , observed polarization is decreased significantly by cancellation .",
    "this cancellation is even greater in the case of @xmath92 . in the center and right",
    "panels of figure  [ hires ] , we present high resolution maps for the lower left corner areas of the maps in figures  [ vecmapnl ] and  [ vecmaplvg ] for the @xmath92 case .",
    "the vectors in the center panels of figure  [ hires ] are computed with the non - local approximation , while the vectors in left panels are computed in the lvg approximation .",
    "again , the maps in the lower panels are obtained by averaging the rays of the upper panels within @xmath113 squares .",
    "the polarization structure obtained in the lvg calculation is more regular , and the polarization percentage is higher , than in the non - local calculation .",
    "this difference occurs because the non - local integration encompasses a significant fraction of the cube , and the probability is high that integration paths will encounter regions with the `` wrong '' velocity gradients  which are plentiful in the computations with the weak magnetic fields . on a significant portion of the surface of these mhd cubes ,",
    "the percentage polarization of the emerging rays is negligible .",
    "however , there are still some localized regions with the polarization at a level of 1% . the directions of the polarization vectors in these regions reflect the large - scale structure in the magnetic and velocity fields , rather than the reversed direction discussed above .    the percentage polarization is decreased by the finite beam size and averages almost to zero when the beam size is greater than @xmath115 . the polarization is higher in the lvg ( than in the non - local ) approximation and tends to be perpendicular to the average magnetic field even in the @xmath92 case . hence , the effect of the beam averaging is less dramatic in the lvg approximation .    in summary",
    ", we see that the percentage polarization is not reduced significantly for modest beam sizes in either the non - local approximation or in the lvg approximation , and persists at a level of @xmath116 even for the weakest magnetic field case that we have considered .",
    "there are now two prevailing views on the evolution of molecular clouds . according to the so called `` standard '' star formation scenario , molecular clouds are rather long - lived entities supported against gravity by the magnetic field @xcite",
    "this support is gradually lost due to ambipolar diffusion , so that some dense clumps within a parent cloud become gravitationally unstable and collapse to form protostars . in the alternative turbulent scenario ,",
    "molecular clouds are dynamic transient objects  being formed and destroyed on a timescale which can be only slightly longer than the dynamical time @xcite .",
    "the existing observational data seem to favor the turbulent scenario , though the evidence can be ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the polarimetry of molecular lines offers further insights into the nature of chaotic motions and magnetic fields in star - forming regions as well as in other astronomical phenomena .",
    "the anisotropy of the decaying mhd turbulence has previously been shown by @xcite to reproduce observed polarization characteristics of oh masers . in this paper , we demonstrate that this anisotropy can also cause a linear polarization of thermal molecular lines that is similar in magnitude to what is observed .",
    "the highest fractional polarization is obtained in our calculations when the average magnetic field is strongest  where the polarization pattern also is most regular .",
    "the number of polarization reversals is greater for magnetic fields of intermediate strength , and is approximately equal to the number of polarization vectors in the `` standard '' direction when @xmath15 .    to see how this result can relate to our previous studies , we consider the polarization of the far infrared emission by dust that would result from the same magnetic field distrubutions . in figure  [ dustpol ]",
    "we reproduce the left panel of figure  6 from @xcite , and plot the dispersion @xmath117 in the position angles of the polarization vectors versus the polarization reduction factor @xmath118 ( which is a relative measure of the percentage polarization ) using the turbulent mhd fields from the co calculations to compute the emission by dust . in our previous studies , we were mainly interested in the relationship between the regular and irregular components of the magnetic field .",
    "hence , we used the ratio of the strength of the random ( rms ) to the uniform magnetic field @xmath119 as a main parameter . in the current study , @xmath120 is a function of both time and @xmath5 .",
    "we simulated the dust polarization in the data cubes using the same methods as in @xcite .",
    "the location of a specific point in figure  [ dustpol ] depends on @xmath120 and on the number of correlation lengths across the cube .",
    "the correlation length does not change significantly during the time evolution in the current simulations .",
    "thus , the @xmath121 and @xmath118 computed here depend only on @xmath120 and lie along a single curve , denoted with the thick gray band in figure  [ dustpol ] .",
    "the bottom part of the band corresponds to lower @xmath5 and/or earlier timesteps .",
    "the upper part of the band corresponds to higher @xmath5 and/or later timesteps .",
    "it can be seen in figure  [ dustpol ] that the turbulent mhd models in our current study lead to polarization characteristics for emission by dust that overlap with the results of our computations in @xcite only for the smallest values of @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the directions of the polarization vectors of the observed co emission tend to be aligned or are smoothly varying  behavior that occurs in our models for which the regular magnetic fields are stronger ( values @xmath122 are typical for models with @xmath123 ) than those considered in our dust polarimetry project .",
    "however , it must be stressed that thermal emission by dust and polarized co emission trace regions that are dramatically different .",
    "the optical depth of  @xmath124 that produces the highest co polarization corresponds to @xmath125  @xmath85 , which is equivalent to molecular hydrogen column density @xmath126  @xmath85 ( or @xmath127 .",
    "this extinction is much smaller than is required to produce observable dust emission .",
    "thus , even when the dust and the polarized co emission are observed in the same object , the dust emission preferentially probes the inner part of the object while the polarized co emission traces the magnetic field in the outer envelope .",
    "our results then tend to indicate that the magnetic field is more uniform in the outer parts of such gas clouds than in the more dense core region which is responsible for the thermal emission by dust .",
    "so far , observations provide only limited opportunities to check our predictions about the polarization of the co lines . unfortunately , some objects where the polarization of thermal lines has been observed are too complex to represent a case of `` pure '' mhd turbulence .",
    "the most appropriate is the dataset obtained for dr  21(oh ) .",
    "data for the dust emission and for the co(21 ) transition have been obtained by @xcite , and for dust emission and the co(10 ) transition by @xcite .",
    "the polarization vectors for the co(10 ) tend to be parallel to the polarization vectors for the dust emission , whereas the polarization vectors for the co(21 ) tend to be perpendicular to both the dust emission and the co(10 ) vectors .",
    "@xcite argued that the co(21 ) polarization can reflect the influence of the external radiation and can then be directed parallel to the magnetic field . at the same time , the co(10 ) polarization reflects the influence of the velocity structure and is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this is exactly the situation that is expected from our current computations . in the absence of a ( strong enough ) source of continuum radiation , the polarization vectors for the dust and",
    "the co should be parallel to one another and perpendicular to the average magnetic field .",
    "moreover , while we have no way to relate the magnetic fields in our mhd cubes to the gravitational stability of the objects that they may represent , our results are in general agreement with the @xcite conclusion that the envelope of dr  21(oh ) is highly subcritical .",
    "the observation that the directions of the polarization vectors of the dust and the co(10 ) are parallel in this object indicates that they trace the same average magnetic field and are thus correlated .",
    "however , the location of dr  21(oh ) in the @xmath128 diagram ( marked in figure  [ dustpol ] ) implies the value of @xmath120 is near 1 .",
    "the presence of a significant irregular component as well as large scale variations in the magnetic field suggests that the field is not very dynamically important in the dense part of dr  21(oh ) , which is traced by the dust emission . on the other hand , the small position angle dispersion for the co(10 ) polarization vectors corresponds to much smaller @xmath120 values and , thus , to a regular magnetic field structure that is not affected by gas motions at either large or small scales .",
    "another detail in the observations of dr  21(oh ) presented by @xcite that resembles features in the current computations is the @xmath129 change in the direction of the co(10 ) polarization just to the west of the main polarization peak at @xmath130  km s@xmath131 ( their figure  4 ) .",
    "however , since these `` rotated '' vectors are parallel to those of the co(21 ) polarization they may just indicate the influence of a compact continuum source rather than the occurence of the `` reversals '' found in this study .",
    "because of the low density of the gas traced by polarized co emission , it can be used to probe the nature of the turbulence in molecular clouds more widely than just in regions of star formation .",
    "such observations are beyond the reach of current instruments , but may be possible with alma  provided that alma has the necessary polarimetric capabilities .",
    "when these data become available , and are combined with the polarimetry data from starlight , a coherent picture of the large scale velocity and magnetic field structure in the molecular ism may emerge .",
