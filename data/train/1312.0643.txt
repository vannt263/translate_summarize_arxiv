    "the production of newborn stars in galaxies is regulated by a sequence of interstellar processes that span a range of spatial scales , environmental conditions , and gas phases .",
    "the development of molecular clouds from the diffuse , atomic , interstellar medium is impacted by spiral density waves , mid - plane pressures owing to the overlying weight of stars and gas , the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field , magneto - turbulence , and expanding shells from the cumulative effects of supernovae and hii regions .",
    "jeans and thermal instabilities , ambipolar diffusion , and shocks from converging , super - alfvenic flows are drivers of the fragmentation of molecular clouds into dense ( @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath9 ) filaments and clumps . from these filament structures ,",
    "even higher density ( @xmath10 @xmath9 ) , compact structures emerge from the actions of gravity , ambipolar diffusion , instabilities , and turbulent shocks .",
    "such high volume density configurations are the basic unit from which newborn stars form . given the large range of scales and physical processes , a composite view of star formation is required , which includes information from nearby galaxies and well - resolved star forming regions in the milky way @xcite .",
    "star formation in galaxies is frequently parameterized by the scaling relationship between the rate of star formation , @xmath11 , and the mass of available neutral , interstellar gas , @xmath12 .",
    "more typically , the relationship is cast between the surface density of the star formation rate , @xmath13 , and gas surface density , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the supplies of atomic and molecular gas mass are respectively traced by hi  21  cm line emission and the low - j rotational lines of co. the relationship between @xmath13  and @xmath14  is well described by a power law with an index , @xmath15 ranging from sub - linear @xcite , to linear @xcite to super - linear @xcite .",
    "comparable indices are found if one only considers the molecular gas surface density as derived from co , which primarily tracks the low density substrate of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "followup studies that examine the surface density of dense gas using hcn @xmath16 emission or the higher rotational transitions of co identify a linear correlation with @xmath13  @xcite , which emphasizes that star formation is regulated by the development of dense gas configurations within molecular clouds .    in recent years",
    ", there have been several efforts to connect the star formation properties of resolved , galactic star forming regions to these extragalactic scaling relationships .",

    "therefore , sources with @xmath38 or @xmath39@xmath18 -10  km  s@xmath6  are excluded .",
    "these provisions limit our study to the population of molecular clouds residing within the disk of the milky way and galactocentric radii , @xmath40  kpc .",

    "the velocity of dense gas selects which @xmath0co  velocity component along the line of sight ( if more than one ) is linked to the 1.1 mm source and facilitates the isolation of the parent molecular cloud from the extended @xmath0co  emission .",
    "in addition , these detections confirm the presence of high density ( @xmath41  @xmath9 ) gas that is necessary to excite these transitions .",
    "such densities are comparable to values inferred by @xcite from zones with k - band extinctions in excess of 0.8 magnitudes in a sample of nearby star forming regions .",
    "while the detection of these tracers indicates the presence of dense gas , the mean gas density may be lower if material is inhomogenously distributed .",
    "the gmcs linked to each selected bgps source are identified by regions of @xmath0co  @xmath16 emission . in the galactic plane",
    ", the isolation of co emission from a singular cloud is frequently complicated by the blending of signal from nearby or unrelated clouds at or near the same velocity .",
    "such crowding is particularly severe near the maximum velocity for a given line of sight through the inner galaxy .",
    "a cloud identification algorithm is necessary to uniformly isolate the co emission from the target cloud linked to the bgps source .",
    "given the prior information of the dust source position and velocity , we have decomposed the @xmath0co  @xmath16 emission centered on each bgps source in our sample .",
    "the algorithm ` cprops ` @xcite is applied to an extracted @xmath0co  data cube with an area typically @xmath42  deg@xmath43 in angular extent centered on the position of the bgps source and @xmath3420  km  s@xmath6  of the velocity of the dense gas tracer .",
    "the temperature threshold , @xmath44 , is varied for each cloud to best isolate its emission from other nearby clouds or clouds at a similar velocity . since our intent is to define the global properties of the cloud based on @xmath0co  @xmath16 emission and not the hierarchical structure of the cloud , we do not decompose the cloud further into constituent clumps or fragments .",
    "a three - dimensional ( @xmath45 ,  @xmath46 ,  @xmath39 ) mask is generated from the set of voxels that define the cloud at a given threshold .",
    "based on this mask , ` cprops ` calculates the positional and velocity moments and integrated @xmath0co  emission while also accounting for the finite resolutions of the antenna beam and spectrometer . while the cloud mask is defined at a given threshold of antenna temperature , the cloud properties are extrapolated to a common threshold of @xmath47  k. since there is subjectivity in the precise threshold that defines the cloud , which leads to uncertainties in the properties , we identify each cloud over a sequence of intensity thresholds that reasonably isolates the cloud .",
    "the tabulated cloud properties and errors are assigned to the average and standard deviation of values calculated for the threshold sequence .",
    "the gmc properties and errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "the bgps source that links the @xmath0co  cloud as a region of interest , is labeled the primary source for the cloud .",
    "since we are interested in all sources of dense gas in the cloud , any bgps source from the catalog with a voxel position within the cloud mask is linked to that cloud . in some cases",
    ", a secondary sources may not have a flux greater than the flux limit in the initial selection requirement but are included in the mass estimate of dense gas .",
    "bgps sources without velocity measurements but with fluxes @xmath1 0.75  jy and coincident with a local @xmath0co  intensity peak , are also linked to the cloud .      in order to transform observed properties of clouds and bgps sources ( column density , angular size ) into physical properties ( mass , physical size ) ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the distance to each cloud . in this study",
    ", we use kinematic distances , @xmath48 , derived from the rotation curve of @xcite . for locations in the inner galaxy , there are two kinematic distances equally spaced on either side of the tangent point which have the same radial velocity along any line of sight .",
    "the ambiguity is resolved using the presence or absence of hi self - absorption and the size - velocity dispersion relation for molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the utility of the presence ( absence ) of self - absorption of hi 21  cm line profiles to discriminate near ( far ) side clouds .",
    "all molecular clouds retain a residual amount of cold ( @xmath49  k ) atomic hydrogen gas owing to the equilibrium between  formation and destruction by cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "in addition , molecular clouds are circumscribed by a layer of atomic gas , that may be cold ( @xmath50  k ) or warm ( @xmath51  k ) @xcite . the cold , neutral atomic gas within a molecular cloud or circumscribing the cloud absorbs 21  cm line emission from the near ubiquitous , warm , neutral atomic component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) over the narrow velocity range of the cloud .",
    "accordingly , for a near - side molecular cloud , one would expect to observe self - absorption in the 21  cm line as there is a significant background of warm neutral gas at the velocity of the cloud near the far side location .",
    "however , for a far - side cloud , there is warm neutral gas at the near side location between the cloud and the observer .",
    "so any self - absorption from the far side cloud itself is `` filled - in '' by warm , neutral gas at the near side velocity .",
    "therefore , for far - side clouds , the expectation is the absence of a self - absorption feature at the velocity of the molecular cloud .    for each cloud identified by @xmath0co , the 21  cm line emission from the very large array ( vla ) galactic plane survey ( vgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is examined for the presence or absence of self - absorption .",
    "an average , 21  cm line `` on '' profile is calculated from all spectra that lie within the @xmath0co - defined mask of the cloud . a corresponding , mean `` off '' profile is derived from all spectra circumscribing the @xmath0co  mask with the same size area as the defined cloud .",
    "the presence of self - absorption at the velocity of the molecular cloud is visually assessed independently by the authors in this study for consistency and reliability .    a secondary discriminator to resolve the distance ambiguity relies on the size - velocity dispersion relationship for molecular clouds .",
    "the cloud - to - cloud relationship between cloud size , @xmath52 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath53 , results from the co - linear , or universal , velocity structure functions of clouds such that the quantity @xmath54 is nearly constant for clouds residing within the disk of the milky way .",
    "the near - invariance of @xmath55 enables an estimate of the distance to the cloud , @xmath56 , based on the measured velocity dispersion , surface density , and the angular radius of the cloud , @xmath57 , in radians , @xmath58 where @xmath59 km  s@xmath6  pc@xmath60 @xcite . while the fractional population variance precludes its use as an absolute measure of distance",
    ", it is sufficient to discriminate a near - side cloud from a far - side cloud for velocities well displaced from the terminal velocity for most longitudes . for each cloud",
    "harboring a bgps source , the @xmath0co  velocity dispersion and cloud size , evaluated at both the near and far side distances , are examined in relation to the constant value of @xmath55 .",
    "the cloud distance is assigned to the kinematic distance , @xmath48 , that most closely agrees with the constant , @xmath55 .    both the hi self - absorption and size - velocity dispersion methods are applied to resolve the near / far side distance ambiguity . however",
    ", a higher weight is assigned to the hi self - absorption measure to establish a distance .",
    "sources for which the measured cloud velocity is within 10  km  s@xmath6  of the terminal velocity of the rotation curve for the source longitude , are assigned a distance corresponding to the tangent point position .",
    "we have compared our distance assignments to those derived by @xcite and @xcite . for common sources ,",
    "our near and far side assignments agree with 83% and 88% of the assignments made by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "while these methods to resolve the near / far side ambiguity are not infallible , the consistency between three independent groups provides confidence that these assignments are not the limiting error in our results .      to calculate the gmc mass from @xmath0co  emission , we assume optically thin emission , a constant excitation temperature of 10  k , and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions to account for population of molecules in the higher excitation states",
    "this provides a direct conversion from the @xmath0co  luminosity , @xmath61 , in units of k  kms@xmath6  pc@xmath43 , to gmc mass @xmath62 l_{13 } \\;\\;\\ ; m_\\odot\\ ] ] where the term in square brackets accounts for the varying @xmath31c to @xmath0c abundance ratio with galactocentric radius , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a constant  to @xmath31co  abundance of 2@xmath6410@xmath65 is assumed @xcite and a mean molecular weight of 1.36 is applied to account for the contribution from helium .",
    "the gmc masses and estimated random errors are shown in table  1 .",
    "our assumptions of a constant excitation temperature , constant abundance , and optically thin @xmath0co  emission are clearly a simplification of the complex thermal and density structure of molecular clouds along the line of site that can lead to systematic errors .",
    "@xcite show that deviations from lte conditions can cause underestimations of the @xmath0co  true column densities by a factor ranging from 1.3 to 7 .",
    "an excitation temperature of 10  k provides a reasonable reference value .",
    "it is motivated by the distributions of @xmath31co  excitation temperatures which peaks at a value of 7  k @xcite . for densities less than the critical density of the @xmath16 transition ( @xmath66  @xmath9 ) ,",
    "@xmath0co  is likely subthermally excited . in this regime ,",
    "which may contain a significant fraction of the cloud mass , the column densities derived using the thermalized excitation temperature underestimate the true column density @xcite . for example , if the true excitation temperature is 5  k , then the calculated column density assuming @xmath67  k is @xmath68 the value using the correct measure of excitation .",
    "similarly , our assumption of optically thin emission for all lines of sight leads to an underestimation of the true column density by the factor @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite find the mean opacity integrated over the position - position - velocity volume of gmcs is 1.5 .",
    "this mean opacity corresponds to a column density 1.9 times larger than the column density assuming @xmath70 .",
    "the application of a constant abundance for all clouds and all lines of sight within clouds introduces additional errors .",
    "the assumed relative  to @xmath0co  abundances are only valid in the strongly self - shielded interior of the cloud . a recent study by @xcite shows that the @xmath0co  self - shielded regime accounts for only 50% of the total  mass of the orion molecular cloud . given our assumptions and the described effects , the derived values for @xmath71",
    "should be considered lower limits .",
    "finally , the use of kinematic distances can also impact the reliability of cloud mass measurements .",
    "non - circular motions induced by a spiral arm potential or random cloud motions can also lead to uncertainties of order 50% in the mass estimates but these are expected to be random .",
    "a more complex error to quantify is the identification of the gmc at a given threshold .",
    "the error assigned to @xmath71 and listed in table  1 is the standard deviation of mass values determined from the sequence of antenna temperature thresholds for which the cloud is well distinguished from extended signal .",
    "if the number of thresholds is less than 3 , then the assigned error is the statistical error calculated by ` cprops ` through the bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "the surface density of the gmc is calculated from the expression , @xmath72 and the mean volume density is estimated by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the effective radius of the cloud .",
    "the mass of each bgps source , @xmath75 , can be estimated from its integrated flux density , @xmath76 , assuming that the dust emission at 1.1  mm is optically thin and well characterized by a single temperature and opacity , @xmath77 where @xmath48  is the distance to the cloud harboring the bgps source , @xmath78 is the planck function evaluated at @xmath79  mm and dust temperature , @xmath80 , and @xmath81  cm@xmath43  g@xmath6 is the dust opacity per gram of gas @xcite and includes a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "the dust column density , mass and respective uncertainties are determined from a monte - carlo simulation of equation  5 that samples a temperature distribution and source flux density distribution based on the measured flux density and flux density error listed in the bgps catalog and assumed to follow a gaussian function .",
    "all dust masses and estimated random errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution of dust temperatures centered on @xmath83  k with a dispersion of 4  k , which approximates the variation of dust temperatures found in bgps sources by @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge a single dust temperature oversimplifies the distribution of thermal energy within a dust source .",
    "temperature gradients along the line of sight arise from external and internal heating sources that can bias the estimate of a mean dust temperature along the line of sight to higher values and lead to an underestimation of the dust column density @xcite . for the bgps sources studied here",
    ", an embedded massive protostar or young stellar cluster can raise the local dust temperature to 40 - 100 k within a limited volume of the dust source . by assuming a lower dust temperature throughout the source , the derived mass from the dust continuum emission overestimates the true mass . also , we do not include uncertainties or a finite range of values in @xmath84 when calculating dust masses .",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath84 should not vary by more than a factor of two , which would similarly impact the dust mass error .    the mass surface density and mean volume density are @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the effective radius of the dust continuum source . for those sources that are unresolved along one or both of the source axes , the radius is assigned an upper limit corresponding to angular size of 14  at the distance of the source .",

    "152 contain a singular dust source , 81 contain 2 dust sources , 43 contain 3 sources , and 68 contain 4 or more sources .",
    "the nature of the selected bgps sources and isolated clouds is revealed , in part , by the distributions of mass surface densities , mean volume densities , and masses .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the distributions of mass surface density for the gmcs , and all dust sources , @xmath91 . the sharp lower cutoff for @xmath92 is a result of the surface brightness threshold used to define the cloud ,",

    "the mass surface densities for this sample of clouds are comparable to those determined by @xcite but higher than the values derived by @xcite , who used the more extended cloud boundaries defined by @xcite based on @xmath31co  emission . in these cases , @xmath0co  emission does not fill the area resulting in lower surface densities . surprisingly , the dust surface densities are comparable to the corresponding cloud surface densities . for gmcs with small angular sizes ,",
    "this equivalence is due to the median filtering of the bolocam pipeline to remove atmospheric signal ( discussed in more detail in  4 ) that simply recovers the cloud mass . for",
    "other dust sources the condition @xmath93 may reflect a clumpy distribution of dense sub - fragments .",
    "the clumpy nature of the dust sources is supported by the derived mean volume densities shown in figure  [ fig2 ] and those tabulated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the volume densities of the dust sources are larger than those of the gmcs by factors of 3 - 5 yet smaller than the excitation requirements of hco@xmath23 @xmath24 line and the nh@xmath26 inversion lines .",
    "the detection of one or more of these high density tracers attest to the presence of gas with volume densities in excess of @xmath94  @xmath9 .",
    "the gas in this set of dust sources responsible for high excitation line emission is likely distributed within high density fragments that are unresolved by the bolocam 33  angular resolution .",
    "such inhomogeneous conditions are present in the sample of dust sources analyzed by @xcite in which the mean volume densities range are @xmath9510@xmath96  @xmath9  but gas with volume densities of 10@xmath97  @xmath9  are inferred from multi - level transitions of cs .",

    "therefore , the dust masses derived from the bgps 1.1  mm dust emission are upper limits to the amount of high density material within the cloud .    to further isolate regions of high density within the cloud that are more coupled to the production of stars , we examined the bgps surface brightness images of 1.1  mm dust continuum emission and the images of source masks that link pixels to a cataloged source @xcite .",

    "therefore , our estimates of @xmath103 and @xmath105 are upper limits to the true mass fractions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these mass ratios are unaffected by uncertainties associated with our distance determination , since the distance terms cancel out of the ratio .",

    ", the median filtering removes the atmospheric contribution and recovers all or some large fraction of the cloud column density @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the derived dust masses are comparable to the @xmath0co - derived cloud masses .",
    "the median filtering is responsible for the results of @xcite who found decreasing volume densities with distance , which in most cases , corresponds to the decreasing angular size of the clouds .",
    "for gmcs with sizes greater than 6  ( filled points ) , this effective median filtering removes atmospheric and the extended cloud emission and recovers compact regions within the cloud with enhanced column density .",
    "the distributions of @xmath103 and @xmath105 are asymmetrically skewed towards higher values .",
    "the median value of @xmath103 is @xmath4 where the errors correspond to 1@xmath37 offsets that encompass 68% of the sample .",
    "values of @xmath105 are our best estimate for the dense gas mass fraction , @xmath21 , in gmcs .",
    "the median value and 1@xmath37 spread of the measured @xmath105 distribution for gmcs with angular sizes greater than 3  are @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement errors of these ratios are 0.06 and 0.04 for @xmath103 and @xmath105 respectively with the largest contribution from the dust mass uncertainties .",
    "we re - emphasize that the derived ratios are limited by systematic errors that overestimate the true values of these mass fractions .",
    "recent studies by @xcite have analyzed the same data sets to derive @xmath103 in a sample of clouds within varying environments in the galactic plane .",
    "they found no systematic variation of mean @xmath103 values between near side , far side , and tangent point clouds , although values range from 1 - 20% .",
    "@xcite considered the variation of this ratio between arm and inter - arm regions along the lines of sight over the range @xmath106 .",
    "they found no significant difference in clouds that lie within a spiral feature and those located between arms .",
    "however , they did identify a very large value ( 36% ) for the perseus arm , which is located on the far - side of the tangent point for these lines of sight .",
    "this large value is most likely due to the small angular size of clouds at these distances and the effective median filtering of the bgps processing that recovers the cloud column density and mass rather than sub - regions of high volume or column density .",
    "excluding the distant , perseus arm sample , their mean @xmath103 values are 5% .",
    "the factor of two difference between our results may lie in our application of a flux limit which biases our sample to larger dust masses or in the different cloud identification methods .",
    "our results for @xmath107 can be further compared to other studies which estimate the dense gas fraction using infrared - derived extinctions of background stars as measures of gas column density .",
    "when possible , such extinction studies are more reliable to evaluate a dense gas fraction than the method used in this study as the full range of cloud column density is derived with a singular tracer of gas column density and is not dependent on local , molecular chemistry or dust temperature .",
    "however , such extinction studies are challenging for more distance clouds owing to contamination by foreground stars as well as foreground extinctions . to date , such studies are limited to a small number of local clouds and even a smaller number of gmcs in the molecular ring of the galaxy , ( although , see @xcite ) . from their sample of 11 local clouds ,",

    "this function provides a concise description of the mass distribution in a cloud .",
    "evaluated at 200 m@xmath2pc@xmath3 , they find low values ( @xmath950.02 ) in starless clouds and higher values 0.05 - 0.2 in star forming clouds like cep  a , perseus , taurus , and orion .",

    "first , figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] demonstrate that @xmath21  is independent of the mass and surface density of the host gmc .",
    "this invariance excludes the suggestion by @xcite that the extragalactic , super - linear kennicutt - schmidt scaling relationship emerges from a dependence of @xmath21  on @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the area filling factor of gmcs within the extragalactic aperture and @xmath115 is the average mass surface density of gmcs .",
    "furthermore , the mean value of the dense gas mass fraction can be compared to the fraction of cloud material converted into stars over a free - fall time , @xmath116 , which provides an important constraint to theoretical descriptions of star formation .",
    "for a volumetric star formation law , @xcite calculate the range @xmath117 that describes the composite measurements of the kennicutt - schmidt scaling relationship from resolved gmcs in the galaxy and nearby galaxies to more distant starbursts and high redshift systems .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] demonstrate a small amount of a cloud s mass resides within a dense configuration to form newborn stars .",
    "recalling that these are likely upper limits and only a fraction of the dense gas will develop into stars , the small values of @xmath116 can be attributed to the deficiency of high volume density gas as measured by @xmath21 , rather than some process _ within _ the dense gas that inhibits infall or the presence of a diffuse , molecular component that is inert to the production of stars .",
    "star formation is therefore limited by the processes responsible for the formation of dense , compact structures within magneto - turbulent clouds .",
    "the kinematic relationship between the dense gas and the low density substrate , as traced by @xmath0co  emission , offers insight to processes responsible for clump and filament formation in gmcs .",
    "many recent studies have proposed that dense filamentary structures develop at the stagnation points of supersonic , converging or collapsing gas streams in gmcs @xcite . in such cases",
    ", there should be a velocity offset between the dense gas and the converging , low density material @xcite . to evaluate the velocity displacement between the bgps source and the surrounding , low density material , we calculate the difference between the centroid velocity of the dense gas tracer from @xcite or @xcite and the centroid velocity of the @xmath0co  spectrum averaged over a 3@xmath643 arcmin@xmath43 area centered on the bgps source .",
    "we restrict the sample to primary bgps sources residing within gmcs with angular extents larger than 3  so that the @xmath0co  velocity centroid is representative of local motions about the bgps source rather than the entire cloud .",
    "the distribution of velocity centroid differences for our sample is shown in figure  [ fig6]a .",
    "it is strongly peaked on zero velocity displacement .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite find similar distributions of velocity differences between the velocity centroids of @xmath0co  and high density tracers in the nearby perseus molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite also derive a centrally peaked distribution of velocity differences centered on zero between @xmath0co  and nh@xmath26 line centroids for a flux limited sample of atlasgal sources throughout the inner galaxy .",
    "the small velocity centroid differences found in these distributions do not necessarily indicate small velocity displacements between the dense gas and overlying material or that these two components are co - moving .",
    "each velocity centroid measures the line of sight component of the respective gas motions . since it is reasonable to assume that any relative motion between the dense gas and low density medium is randomly oriented with respect to the observer , true velocity displacements are necessarily diluted by orientation .",
    "we model the observed distribution of velocity differences in the context of converging , radial flows with varying velocity offsets that are randomly oriented .",
    "while such converging flows are not a unique description of the velocity differences between the dense gas and lower density medium , these models can constrain the mean flow velocity in the limiting case that the @xmath0co  @xmath16 emission primarily originates within a converging or collapsing parcel of low density gas centered on the bgps source .",
    "two simple flow configurations are considered : a single , one sided flow , and a two - sided , converging , yet misaligned flow .",
    "the flow velocity is referenced to the velocity of the dense gas and is taken as the average projected velocity to the observed line of sight . in practice , the mean projected velocity also depends on the density of the flows being considered as this impacts the line excitation .    for a one - sided , radial flow of low density gas moving relative to the dense gas with a random inclination angle ,",
    "the radial velocity is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the velocity amplitude of the flow , @xmath57 is the angle of the flow off the x - y plane and @xmath120 is the polar angle within the x - y plane .",
    "the observer s line of sight is along the x axis .",
    "the value of @xmath121 is selected randomly from a uniform distribution range @xmath122 .",
    "the value of @xmath120 is selected randomly from a uniform distribution between @xmath123 .",
    "the cumulative distributions of relative velocities for 3 different values of @xmath119 are shown in figure [ fig6]b along with the observed cumulative distribution .",
    "the model distributions are centered on zero with widths dependent on the value of @xmath119 . the observed distribution",
    "is well bounded by flow velocities of 1 - 3  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "models with @xmath124 and 3  km  s@xmath6  respectively under - predict and over - predict the frequency of large velocity centroid differences .",
    "the model with @xmath125  km  s@xmath6  offers a reasonable approximation of the measured distribution .",
    "the second set of models considers radially converging flows that are misaligned with respect to each other .",
    "such misaligned flows are present in the computational simulations of supersonic turbulent flows in gmcs @xcite .",
    "the projected velocity is determined from equation for the front , ( f ) , and back,(b ) , hemispheres such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "the model projected velocity of the low density gas is the average of the radial velocity of the two flows , @xmath128 .",
    "the cumulative distributions of relative velocities for three different velocity amplitudes are shown in figure [ fig6]c along with the observed distribution .",
    "the distribution of relative velocities in this case is narrower than the one - sided flow case for the same value of @xmath119 . when the two - sided , radial flows are nearly aligned , the velocity difference is always close to zero as the receding frontside and approaching backside velocities nearly cancel .",
    "for the two - sided , misaligned flow , the velocity amplitude of @xmath129  km  s@xmath6  best matches the observed distribution of velocity differences .    in the context that the measured distribution of velocity displacements results from converging or infalling material towards a dense , central clump or core , these simple models constrain the velocity of the converging gas to be 2 - 4  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a statistical measure of the velocity difference averaged over random orientations to the line of sight .",
    "it is not possible to derive a true velocity displacement between the dense gas and low density material circumscribing the dense gas for any single target .",
    "the converging gas motions inferred from the models imply a mach number of 10 - 20 for a gas temperature of 10  k. for an for isothermal gas , such converging , supersonic motions should produce very large density fluctuations in shocks .",
    "however , on the spatial scales resolved by these observations , such shocks would be difficult to detect .",
    "indeed , we measure no systematic variation of the dense gas fraction or a contrast ratio , ( @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) , with velocity dispersion .",
    "recent computational studies have examined the role of converging flows in the formation of molecular clouds and the development of cloud sub - structure and turbulence @xcite .",
    "a common feature in the simulations is the development of massive filaments as material accumulates within the post - shock regions due to gravity , turbulence , and thermal instabilities .",
    "the filaments are gravitationally unstable and undergo further collapse and fragmentation into localized cores . @xcite carried out a parameter study of converging , supersonic flows for mach numbers ranging from 1 to 9 .",
    "they find higher mach number flows generate a larger range of core masses and a smaller median core mass due to the reduced jeans mass in the post shock region .",
    "our estimate of the converging flow mach number is comparable to their largest mach number used in their parameter study .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum mass from their simulation is 50  m@xmath2 , which is much smaller than the typical dust mass listed in table 1 .    in the case of converging streams of warm , neutral",
    ", atomic gas ( wnm ) studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite the formation of filaments is a downstream process resulting from instabilities and turbulence generated from the large scale collision and occurring 1 - 2@xmath132 years after the initial interaction .",
    "the clumps and filaments have mach numbers and surface densities comparable to the bgps sources studied here but with maximum masses of @xmath133  m@xmath2 , which are much smaller than the typical mass of a bgps source @xcite .",
    "more massive filaments may result from the continued accumulation of material from the large scale collapse of the clouds predicted by these simulations .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparisons between the gas properties and kinematics associated with these regions to our results is not possible or straightforward as the simulations focus on mass distributions of the densest regions ( cores ) in the simulations , which we do not resolve , and the true velocities of large scale flows , which we can not determine .",
    "despite this , the results of @xcite suggest low fractions of dense gas in colliding flows , consistent with our findings . at the onset of star formation in their simulations they find",

    "we have examined the properties of the host giant molecular clouds associated with a flux limited sample of 1.1  mm dust continuum sources from the bolocam galactic plane survey .",
    "these dust sources are representative of massive clumps in gmcs from which stellar clusters and massive stars ultimately form .",

    "the fraction of gmc mass residing within the dust sources with mass surface densities greater than 200 m@xmath2pc@xmath3  is @xmath5 .",

    "the distribution of velocity differences between the dense gas and surrounding lower density material is centrally peaked on zero displacement .",

    "<S> the mass fraction of dense gas within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) of the milky way is investigated using @xmath0co  data from the fcrao galactic plane surveys and the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ) of 1.1  mm dust continuum emission . a sample of 860 compact dust sources are selected from the bgps catalog and kinematically linked to 344 clouds of extended ( @xmath13 ) @xmath0co  j=1 - 0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> gas masses are tabulated for the full dust source and subregions within the dust sources with mass surface densities greater than 200 m@xmath2pc@xmath3 , which are assumed to be regions of enhanced volume density . </S>",
    "<S> masses of the parent gmcs are calculated assuming optically thin @xmath0co  </S>",
    "<S> j=1 - 0 emission and lte conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean fractional mass of dust sources to host gmc mass is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the high column density subregions comprise @xmath5 of the mass of the cloud . owing to our assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> these values are upper limits to the true mass fractions . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional mass of dense gas is independent of gmc mass and gas surface density . </S>",
    "<S> the low dense gas mass fraction suggests that the formation of dense structures within gmcs is the primary bottleneck for star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of velocity differences between the dense gas and the low density material along the line of sight is also examined . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong , centrally peaked distribution centered on zero velocity displacement . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution of velocity differences is modeled with radially converging flows towards the dense gas position that are randomly oriented with respect to the observed line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> these models constrain the infall velocities to be 2 - 4 km  s@xmath6  for various flow configurations . </S>"
