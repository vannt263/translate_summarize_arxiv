    "gravitational microlensing is an important method to detect extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "the method is sensitive to planets not easily accessible to other methods , in particular cool and small planets at or beyond the snow line @xcite , and free - floating planets @xcite .",
    "the snow line represents the location in the protoplanetary disk beyond which ices can exist @xcite and thus the surface density of solids is highest @xcite .",
    "according to the core accretion theory of planet formation @xcite , the snow line plays a crucial role because giant planets are thought to form in the region immediately beyond the snow line .",
    "therefore , microlensing planets can provide important constraints on planet formation theories , in particular by measuring the mass function beyond the snow line @xcite .",
    "a major component of current planetary microlensing experiments is being carried out in survey and follow - up mode , where survey experiments are conducted in order to maximize the event rate by monitoring a large area of the sky one or several times per night , while follow - up experiments are focused on events alerted by survey observations to densely cover planet - induced perturbations . in this mode , high - magnification events are important targets for follow - up observations .",
    "this is because the source trajectories of these events always pass close to the central perturbation region and thus the sensitivity to planets is extremely high @xcite .",
    "in addition , the time of the perturbation can be predicted in advance so that intensive follow - up observation can be prepared .",
    "this leads to an observational strategy of monitoring high - magnification events as intensively as possible , regardless of whether or not they show evidence of planets . as a result",
    ", the strategy allows one to construct an unbiased sample to derive the frequency of planets beyond snow line @xcite . for the alternative low - magnification channel of detection ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of a giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of a high - magnification microlensing event moa  2010-blg-477 . due to the high magnification of the event ,",
    "the perturbation was very densely covered , enabling us to place constraints on the physical parameters from the higher - order effects in the lensing light curve induced by finite source effects as well as the orbital motion of both the lens and the earth .",
    "we provide the most probable physical parameters of the planetary system , corresponding to a jupiter - mass planet orbiting a k  dwarf at about 2  au , the system lying at about 2  kpc from earth .",
    "the event moa  2010-blg-477 at coordinates ( ra , dec)=(@xmath8 ( j2000.0 ) , @xmath9 was detected and announced as a microlensing alert event by the microlensing observations in astrophysics @xcite collaboration on 2010 august 2 ( @xmath10 ) using the 1.8 m telescope of mt .",
    "john observatory in new zealand .",
    "the event was also observed by the optical gravitational lensing experiment @xcite using the 1.3 m warsaw telescope of las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "real - time modeling based on the rising part of the light curve indicated that the event would reach very high magnification and enabled us to predict the time of the peak .",
    "followed by this second alert , the peak of the light curve was densely covered by follow - up groups of the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ) @xcite , microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath11fun ) @xcite , robonet @xcite , and microlensing network for the detection of small terrestrial exoplanets ( mindstep ) @xcite .",
    "more than twenty telescopes were used for the follow - up observations , including planet 1.0 m of south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in south africa , planet 1.0 m of mt .",

    "unfortunately , the data quality of these pioneering observations was not high enough to be included into the models , but we give a short overview in appendix  [ app : astep ] . in order to better constrain the second - order effects ,",
    "new observations were taken at the @xmath11fun 1.3 m smarts telescope at ctio during the 2011 campaign .    to better characterize the lensed source star ,",
    "spectroscopic observations were conducted near the peak of the event ( @xmath12 ) by using the b&c spectrograph on the 2.5 m du pont telescope at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the resolution was @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath14   .",
    "a comparison between the observed spectrum and synthetic ones was conducted to derive the effective temperature , gravity and metallicity of the source star .",
    "the usable part of the spectrum is only @xmath15     due to some scattered light issues with the instrument , particularly a problem for this faint star .",
    "we started by fitting standard stars using h@xmath16 , mgb , and nad , but found that fits with h@xmath16 alone resulted in the most accurate temperatures , so this is the diagnostic we used .",
    "the derived parameters of the source star are @xmath17  k for @xmath18 and a solar metallicity .",
    "the corresponding fit to the h@xmath16 line is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the data collected by the individual groups were initially reduced using various photometry codes developed by the individual groups . for the data sets from saao , fts , possum , canopus , perth , danish and monet north , we use photometry from rereductions obtained with the pysis package , described in more details in appendix  [ app : pysis ] .    figure  [ fig : lcurve ] shows the light curve of the event . the event is highly magnified with a peak magnification @xmath19 . outside of the region @xmath20 $ ] , the light curve is consistent with a standard single - lens curve @xcite .",
    "the perturbation is composed of two spikes at @xmath21 and 5420.9 and two bumps at @xmath22 and 5422.4 .",
    "as in the great majority of planetary microlensing events , we are able to measure the `` angular einstein radius '' ( projected on the sky ) @xmath23 , but not the projected einstein radius ( projected on the observer plane ) @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , it is challenging to estimate the physical parameters of the lens .",
    "the two radius quantities are related to those ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see ) by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the lens mass in @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the lens - source relative parallax ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the lens and source distances ) . since @xmath23 is well measured , the product @xmath32 is also well determined , but in the present case , the ratio @xmath33 is poorly constrained , and so it is difficult to estimate @xmath27 alone . in this section ,",
    "we provide an overview of the various techniques that we use to place constraints on the individual quantities @xmath34 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that here @xmath23 is large enough to enable a substantial constraint from upper limits on the lens flux .",
    "that is , from equation  ( [ eqn : theta_e+pi_e ] ) , large @xmath23 implies large @xmath27 or @xmath34 , both of which lead to brighter lenses .",
    "this will lead to the unambiguous conclusion that the lens is nearby , @xmath35kpc , with mass @xmath36 .",
    "the light curve of this event enables stronger constraints than is usually the case because we are able to obtain a measurement of one of the microlens parallax component .",
    "the microlens parallax is actually a vector , @xmath37 , with the magnitude given by equation  ( [ eqn : theta_e+pi_e ] ) and the direction by the lens - source relative motion @xcite .",
    "one component of the parallax only weakly constrains the scalar @xmath38 , but it constrains the direction of proper motion , which will be very important for future observations ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , one parallax component actually does provide a robust lower limit on the mass @xmath39 and distance @xmath40kpc .    to proceed further",
    ", we must apply a bayesian analysis , but here as elsewhere we are more fortunate than is typical . as always , there are bayesian priors from a galactic model , and in this case these strongly prefer the upper end of the mass / distance range permitted by the light curve .",
    "but in addition , the reason that only one dimension of @xmath37 can be robustly measured is that the other dimension is degenerate with orbital motion of the planet @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary to fit simultaneously for both parallax and orbital motion .",
    "bayesian priors on the orbital motion then _ independently _ also prefer the upper end of the allowed mass / distance parameter space .",
    "finally , we predict that high - resolution imaging could measure the mass and distance of the lens through two independent effects , photometry and astrometry .",
    "the first is obvious : different mass / distance combinations yield different color / magnitude measurement .",
    "the main point here is that the large value of @xmath23 virtually guarantees that the lens will be detectable .",
    "the second is less obvious : different mass / distance combinations also predict different _ directions _ of source - lens relative proper motion , which can be measured as the lens and source are separated over the next several years .",
    "the photometric error bars of the various data sets from individual observatories are generally not accurate enough to be taken at face value .",
    "they need a rescaling to reproduce the dispersion of contiguous data points in a given night . at the same time",
    ", outliers must be identified and removed .",
    "these are important preliminary steps to modeling , because the weight of a given data set to constrain the model depends on how large its error bars are , compared to other data sets .",
    "we describe our adopted noise model and rescaling factors for each observatory data set in appendix  [ app : rescaling ] .",
    "we first test a static binary lens model .",
    "the corresponding parameter set includes the three single lens parameters : the einstein time scale , @xmath41 , the time of the closest lens - source approach , @xmath42 , and the lens - source separation at that moment , @xmath43 , and it also includes the three binary parameters : the mass ratio of the companion to its host star , @xmath44 , the projected separation between the lens components in units of the einstein radius , @xmath45 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath16 .",
    "since the light curve exhibits caustic - crossing features , we need to consider the modification of magnifications caused by the finite - source effect @xcite .",
    "this requires us to include an additional parameter : the normalized source radius @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the angular source radius .",
    "evaluation of @xmath48 from the model together with the measurement of @xmath47 ( see section  [ sec : source ] ) will then yield @xmath23 and thus the product @xmath32 ( see equation  [ [ eqn : theta_e+pi_e ] ] ) .      since the event moa  2010-blg-477 involves caustic crossings and approaches , one must compute magnification affected by the finite - source effect .",
    "computation of finite magnifications is based on the numerical ray - shooting method . in this method ,",
    "a large number of rays are uniformly shot from the image plane , bent according to the lens equation , and land on the source plane .",
    "the lens equation is represented by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the complex notations of the source , lens , and image positions , respectively , @xmath53 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the masses of the individual lens components , and @xmath27 is the total mass of the lens system .",
    "then , the magnification is computed as the ratio of the number density of rays on the source plane to the density of the image plane . for the initial search for solutions in the space of the grid parameters ,",
    "we accelerate the computation by using the `` map making '' method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a magnification map is made for a given set of @xmath56 and then it is used to produce numerous light curves resulting from different source trajectories instead of re - shooting rays all over again .",
    "we further accelerate the computation by using a semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation for finite - magnification computation @xcite in the region where the source location is not very close to the caustic .",
    "in computing finite magnifications , we consider the effect of limb darkening of the source star surface by modeling the specific intensity as @xcite @xmath57 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a limb - darkening coefficient ( hereafter ldc ) , @xmath59 is the total flux from the source star , @xmath60 is the angle between the direction toward the observer and the normal to the stellar surface . from the @xmath61 improvement",
    "we find that the limb - darkening effect is clearly detected .",
    "we compute the ldcs for equation  [ eqn : eq4 ] as accurately as possible , including a proper treatment of the effect of extinction .",
    "we refer the interested reader to appendix  [ app : lldc ] for details .",
    "we then test if second - order effects are present in the residuals of the light curve .",
    "these effects may have several origins : orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite , which induces a deviation of the lens - source motion from rectilinear , orbital motion of the planet about the lens star , orbital motion of the source star if it is a binary , and possible additional objects ( planets or stars ) in the lens system .",
    "in fact we will limit our study to the first two effects , namely microlens parallax and planet orbital motion . a binary source in which the companion is either not lensed or too faint to contribute to the light curve can mimic the parallax effect due to the acceleration of the source , in a so - called `` xallarap '' effect .",
    "this effect is described for instance in @xcite and tested in @xcite .",
    "however , it implies in its simplest form 5 additional parameters versus 2 each for parallax and planet orbital motion .",
    "given the fact that our detection of second - order effects , although clear , remains relatively marginal , it would be difficult to trust 5 additional parameters constrained by the light curve residuals from a standard model .",
    "moreover , binary stars generally have long periods , the effect of which will remain undetected in the short lapse of time when our events are observed ( months versus years ) .",
    "testing for a third body , either from a circumbinary planet or a second planet orbiting the lens star , is beyond the scope of this paper , and again would imply a large number of additional parameters to fit , without any guarantee to obtain meaningful results . in the short history of planetary microlensing , it has been evidenced only once @xcite , and in that case only because a feature in the light curve could not be fitted by a single planet model .",
    "there is no such feature in the present light curve . as the domain of possible configurations to test if we add a third body is vast , the effort expended would be incommensurate with the potential scientific return , at least until we get independent evidence that such a modeling effort is necessary : see section  [ sec : highres ] .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : overview ] , the microlens parallax is characterized by a 2-dimensional vector @xmath37 whose magnitude is given by equation  ( [ eqn : theta_e+pi_e ] ) and whose direction is that of the lens - source relative motion on the plane of the sky . hence , there are two parameters @xmath62 , the components of this vector in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the planet orbital motion affects the light curve in two different ways .",
    "first , it causes the binary axis to rotate or , equivalently , makes the source trajectory angle change in time @xcite .",
    "second , it causes the projected binary separation , and thus the magnification pattern , to change in time .",
    "considering that the time scale of the lensing event is of order a month while the orbital period of typical microlensing planets is of order years , the rates of change in @xmath16 and @xmath45 can be approximated as uniform during the event and thus the orbital effect is parameterized by @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the rates of change in the source trajectory angle and projected binary separation in units of @xmath67 , respectively , and @xmath68 is a reference time . as explained in @xcite , the effect of planet orbital motion is similar to the microlensing parallax effect in the sense that the deviations caused by both effects are smooth and long lasting .",
    "then , if the deviation caused by the planet orbital motion is modeled by the parallax effect alone , the measured parallax would differ from the correct value .",
    "therefore , the orbital motion effect is important not only to constrain the orbital properties of the lens , but also to precisely constrain the lens parallax and thus the physical parameters of the lens system .",

    ", the value of @xmath73 does not have an influence on the light curve model @xmath61 values .",
    "however , @xmath73 is still useful because it can be used to help constrain the other orbital parameters to values consistent with a physical orbit .",
    "( this is an issue because it is quite possible to have @xmath75 and @xmath65 values that are not consistent with a bound orbit , and this is a simple way to ensure that this is not the case ) .",

    "in table  [ tab : one ] , we present the results of modeling along with the best - fit parameters for the 3 tested models .",
    "the best - fit light curve is presented in figure  [ fig : lcurve ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : geom ] , we also present the geometry of the lens system .",
    "it is found that the perturbation near the peak of the light curve was caused by the source crossings and approaches of the caustic produced by the binary system with a low - mass companion .",
    "the measured mass ratio between the lens components is @xmath0 and thus the companion is very likely to be a planet .",
    "the measured projected separation between the lens components is @xmath1 , which is close to the einstein radius . as a result ,",
    "the caustic is resonant , implying that the caustic forms a single closed curve composed of 6 cusps .",
    "the perturbations at @xmath82 and @xmath83 are produced by the source crossings of one of the star - side tips of the caustic .",
    "the bumps at @xmath84 and @xmath85 are caused by the source s approach close to the weak and strong cusps on the side of the host star , respectively .",
    "the most important constraints on the lens mass and distance come from the measurement of @xmath23 , which can be rewritten from equation  ( [ eqn : rhodef ] ) as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the intrinsic ( dereddened ) flux of the source and @xmath88 is its intrinsic @xmath89-band surface brightness .",
    "a key point is that the surface brightness does not depend at all on the microlens model ( just on the source color and/or spectrum ) .",

    "the biggest uncertainties are therefore in measuring the surface brightness and measuring the offset between the instrumental flux @xmath69 and the dereddened source flux @xmath87 .",
    "traditionally , these are measured simultaneously by determining the offsets of the color and magnitude , respectively , of the source from the clump on an instrumental cmd @xcite .",
    "an instrumental cmd from ctio is shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] . from it",
    ", we can read instrumental magnitude in @xmath89 of 19.07 .",
    "the instrumental @xmath91 color is measured more accurately from a regression of @xmath92 flux vs. @xmath89 flux , and gives @xmath93 .",
    "comparing to the instrumental clump position , we find @xmath94 and @xmath95 , assuming @xmath96_{0,\\rm clump } = ( 1.06,14.42)$ ] . the color error is determined empirically from a sample of microlensed dwarfs with spectra @xcite , while the magnitude error comes primarily from the error in fitting the clump centroid and the assumed galactocentric distance of 8  kpc ( both about 0.1 mag ) .",
    "these lead to an estimate @xmath97 .",
    "we can compare the dereddened color estimate to the color deduced from the high - resolution spectrum reported in section  [ sec : obs ] , from which we measured an effective temperature of @xmath98k , which corresponds to @xmath99 .",
    "these determinations are marginally consistent .",
    "we adopt the first to maintain the general practice of microlensing papers , but note that if we adopted the mean of the two estimates , the inferred value of @xmath47 ( and so @xmath23 ) would rise by 2% .",
    "finally , we evaluate @xmath100 this value is unusually large and implies that the lens must be very massive or very close .",
    "specifically @xmath101      the model gives a measurement of the light coming not only from the source , but also from any other stars in the same point spread function , generally called blended light .",
    "this light may come from the lens itself , a companion to the lens , a companion to the source , or any unrelated star on the same line of sight , but not participating to the amplification process .",
    "the ogle - iii image of this field , displayed in figure  [ fig : ogle ] , shows two stars at the target position .",
    "their @xmath89-band magnitudes in the ogle - iii photometric catalogue is @xmath102 for the brighter star , numbered 119416 , and @xmath103 for the fainter one with number 119534 .",
    "they are separated by @xmath104 , enough to be separated by psf photometry at good sites such as ctio or las campanas ( ogle ) in chile . a difference image analysis ( dia ) made on ctio images",
    "shows that the microlensed star does not correspond to the position of either star ( red circle in figure  [ fig : ogle ] ) , but is displaced by 1 ctio pixel ( @xmath105 ) from the brighter star .",
    "now , the blended light in @xmath89-band as measured from dophot ctio photometry by the model is @xmath106 , and this corresponds precisely to the flux from the brighter star among the two ogle stars , which is not separated from the microlensed target at the scale of the ctio seeing ( typically @xmath107 ) . knowing that the blended flux comes from an unrelated blended star ,",
    "the light from the lens must be smaller .",
    "we can rigorously conclude that the lens has less than half the light in the observed blend .",
    "otherwise , the lens and blend would be separated by at least @xmath108 in the ogle image , and so would have been at least marginally resolved .",
    "an additional argument showing that the lens is faint enough to remain undetected comes from its large relative proper motion ( @xmath109  mas / yr ) .",
    "dia analysis of ogle - iii good seeing images separated by 3.3 years shows no residual at the target position , which proves that no detected star has moved during this period .    combining this limit with equation  ( [ eqn : thetae2 ] )",
    "yields strong constraints on the lens .",
    "the lens must be closer than the source , and so be at or closer than the galactocentric distance , and suffer the same or less extinction .",
    "these imply @xmath110 , and so @xmath111 , which corresponds to @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "then , even the @xmath113 limit from equation  ( [ eqn : thetae2 ] ) implies @xmath114  mas and so @xmath115kpc .",
    "but @xmath116 then implies @xmath117 , which corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "cycling through this argument one more time yields @xmath119kpc , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "if the lens were in front of some of the dust , this argument would become still stronger .",
    "however , at the relatively high latitude of this field ( @xmath122 ) , most of the dust probably lies in front of 3  kpc , and in any case , there is no basis for adopting a more optimistic assumption about the dust .",
    "table  [ tab : one ] shows that parallax alone improves the fit by @xmath123 , while including both parallax and lens orbital motion improves it by @xmath124 .",
    "however , while _ detection _ of these effects is therefore unambiguous , we can not fully disentangle one from the other . for each effect ,",
    "one of its two parameters is well determined while the other is highly degenerate with one parameter from the other effect .",
    "as first discovered by @xcite and further analyzed by @xcite , weak detections of parallax and orbital motion lead to a strong degeneracy between @xmath125 ( the component of @xmath37 perpendicular to the projected position of the sun ) and @xmath65 ( the component of orbital motion perpendicular to planet - star axis ) , while @xmath126 and @xmath75 are well constrained .",
    "the impact of this is illustrated in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : bayes1 ] , which shows @xmath61 values by color as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "first , it is clear that the parallax vector is almost completely degenerate along a line that is @xmath128 west of north , within @xmath129 of the predicted orientation of @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "second , the light curve excludes @xmath132 at @xmath133 .",
    "as we have @xmath134 this corresponds to @xmath135 .",
    "thus , combining constraints from this section and from section  [ sec : flux ] , and using equation  ( [ eqn : thetae2 ] ) , we have @xmath136 note that , because the parallax contours pass through the origin , parallax provides no additional constraint at low @xmath38 , i.e. , at high mass .",
    "a similar diagram is given for the slightly disfavored @xmath137 solution in figure  [ fig : bayes2 ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : massdistlims ] ) defines the limits of what can be said rigorously about the lens mass and distance based on current data . as we discuss in section  [ sec : highres ] , the lens could almost certainly be detected by high - resolution imaging , which would probably completely resolve the uncertainty in equation  ( [ eqn : massdistlims ] ) . in the meantime , we can perform a bayesian analysis based on a galactic model and constraints from a keplerian orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : bayes1 ] shows that each of these constraints separately favors small values of @xmath38 and hence , relatively large masses and distances ( within the limits set by equation  [ [ eqn : massdistlims ] ] ) , and so tend to reinforce each other .",
    "panel  ( a ) shows the raw results of the mcmc .",
    "panel  ( b ) shows the same chain , post - weighted by the bayesian prior due to the galactic model and the flux constraint .",
    "the latter , which implies @xmath118 ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) is responsible for the circular `` holes '' at the centers of panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite this includes terms not only reflecting the density of lenses along the sight and the expected distribution of proper motions , but also a jacobian transforming from the `` natural microlensing variables '' to the physical system of the galaxy .",
    "it is this last term that actually dominates , particularly in the `` near field '' ( @xmath138kpc ) permitted by the constraints , and is roughly @xmath139 ( @xcite , equation  [ 18 ] ) .",
    "this weighting is so severe that one must ask whether the result of the weighting is plausibly compatible with the raw @xmath61 from the light curve . in this case , the solutions favored by the bayesian post - weighting are compatible with the raw @xmath61 minimum at better than @xmath113 , so there is no major conflict .",
    "panel  ( c ) shows the results of post - weighting the chain only by the orbital jacobian .",
    "this is described in detail by @xcite for the case of chains with complete orbital solutions .",
    "these contain two orbital parameters ( called @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) in addition to the two first - order orbital parameters considered here ( @xmath75 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "these higher order parameters would be completely unconstrained in the present problem , so we simply resample the chain with a uniform integration over these two parameters",
    ". panel  ( c ) clearly also favors more massive , more distant lenses ( although not the most massive ) , but it is not immediately obvious why .",
    "appendix  [ app : jacobi ] details the reasons behind this result .",
    "finally , we note that , as expected , the combined effect of these two priors shown in panel  ( d ) is stronger than either separately .",
    "why do the galactic model and kepler constraints each favor more distant ( and more massive lenses ) than the light curve alone ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bayes1 ] ) ?",
    "the galactic model constraint is virtually guaranteed to favor more distant lenses because , as mentioned above , most of the weighting is simply due to a coordinate transformation from microlensing to physical coordinates , and there is more phase space at larger distances . since the distance errors are fairly large , this effect will be relatively strong .",
    "by contrast , the kepler constraint could have just as easily favored more - distant as less - distant lenses .",
    "the most likely explanation is then , simply , that the light curve prediction of the distance is too close by 1.7 sigma , and the constrained value ( panel d ) is a better estimate .",
    "this conjecture is testable by future observations , as described in the next section .",
    "follow - up observations are important to check the predictions of our models . in the microlensing field ,",
    "the idea of doing follow - up observations preceded the detection of planets , going back at least to 1998 in the case of macho - lmc-5 , with the corresponding hst observations published in @xcite .",
    "then , it was successfully applied to derive more accurate parameters of the planetary systems , using hst or adaptive optics systems at keck or vlt , for instance in @xcite . in the future , it could be used to study planets in the habitable zones of nearby dwarf stars , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "while the bayesian analysis strongly favors a lens close to @xmath142 , i.e , the upper limit permitted by the measurements , there is no airtight evidence against lower - mass lenses .",
    "fortunately , this question can almost certainly be resolved by high - resolution imaging .",
    "the @xmath143 source magnitudes are @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "these come from ctio @xmath147-band measurements , taken simultaneously with @xmath89 and @xmath92-band observations .",
    "a linear regression between both fluxes gives a very accurate instrumental color of @xmath148 .",
    "after converting @xmath147 to the 2mass photometric system and @xmath89 to the ogle - iii system by use of common stars in the ctio field , the color becomes @xmath149 .",
    "subtracting this color from the @xmath89 magnitude of the source in the ogle - iii system ( @xmath150 ) returns the above value for @xmath147 .",
    "as we now show , the lens brightness must be similar to the source brightness .",
    "as can be judged from figure  [ fig : ogle ] , the field is relatively sparse , at a galactic latitude of @xmath151 , so these two stars ( for the moment superposed ) will very likely be the only two stars in their immediate high - resolution neighborhood .",
    "let us consider three examples consistent with equation  ( [ eqn : thetae2 ] ) , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "these would have lens absolute magnitudes @xmath155 according to @xcite and so @xmath156 .",
    "of course , the extinction would be different at these different distances , but the entire column to the source is only @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , a 0.5  @xmath28 lens star will be as bright as the source , and even a lens star at the bottom of the main sequence will produce an easily detectable amount of light ( @xmath158  mag ) over the expected source magnitude .",
    "since all @xmath159 combinations produce similar @xmath147 magnitudes , such a measurement would , by itself , have little predictive power .",
    "but these various scenarios would yield substantially different @xmath160 colors , which would add discriminatory power .",
    "time has been allocated on various large telescopes to observe the field of this event , detect and measure the light coming from the source and lens stars .",
    "in addition , because of the relatively large proper motion , @xmath161  mas / yr the lens and source could be separately resolved within about 5 years .",
    "this would then yield the angle of proper motion ( @xmath162 ) and so ( from figure  [ fig : bayes1 ] ) the amplitude of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we can also consider follow - up observations with the hubble space telescope , which will be able to detect the lens - source relative proper motion as early as 2012 @xcite .",
    "the implied absolute magnitudes for the three examples given above ( @xmath163 , 0.5 , and @xmath164 ) are @xmath165 , and the implied extinction free magnitudes are @xmath166 . since the extinction in the foreground of the lens is @xmath167 , this implies that the host star should be detectable with at least 9% of the @xmath89-band flux of the source star over the full range of main sequence host star masses .    finally , the esa satellite gaia to be launched in 2013 will image the galactic bulge down to @xmath168  mag , so it may detect the lensing object and will certainly measure its proper motion if it does .    in conclusion , these additional observations should reveal whether our choice of second - order effects ( microlensing parallax and planet orbital motion ) correspond to the reality .",
    "if we find contradictory results to our predictions , then it will be a strong argument to conduct the modeling of additional effects mentioned in section  [ sec : second ] , such as xallarap effect from a binary source , or involvement of a third body .",
    "in order to select the best among the three competing models ( standard , parallax only , orbital motion and parallax ) , a simple comparison of @xmath61 values is not enough , because more refined models use more parameters .",
    "taking into account these additional parameters by normalizing the @xmath61 estimate by the number of degree of freedom is not the proper way to select the best model .",
    "a vast literature exists about model selection , and an application of different criteria to astrophysics is described in @xcite . a simple way to take care of",
    "the larger number of parameters is to use the akaike information criterion ( aic ) @xcite , which introduces a penalty to the @xmath61 by adding twice the number of additional parameters .",
    "different criteria , such as the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite or the deviation information criterion , introduced by @xcite , can also be used .",
    "formulas are given below , where @xmath169 is the number of additional parameters , @xmath170 the number of data points , and @xmath171 the @xmath61 of the average parameter set @xmath172 .",
    "@xmath173    as there are 7 parameters in the standard model , 9 in the parallax only model and 11 in the orbital motion and parallax model , we see that our observed difference in @xmath61 of 8.6 in the parallax only model is only marginally significant according to the aic ( the expected difference is 4 ) , while the observed difference of 54.4 ( for the @xmath174 ) or 50.7 ( for the @xmath137 ) is clearly an improvement of the orbital motion and parallax model over the standard one ( the expected difference is 8) .",
    "similar results are obtained using dic , while the difference between models returned by bic is less significant",
    ".    however , it is important to note that @xmath169 strictly corresponds to the number of additional parameters only in the case of a linear regression problem . here , we clearly have non - linear fits , so we should compute an `` effective '' number of parameters , which is difficult to estimate .",
    "the above conclusion should therefore not be taken as a quantitative one .",
    "a confirmation of the detection of second - order effects comes from the fact that in the orbital motion and parallax model , the degeneracy between @xmath137 and @xmath174 models is clearly broken .",
    "it is instructive to plot both second - order effects vs each other , separately for the @xmath137 and @xmath174 solutions .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig : secorder ] , where the orbital motion @xmath175 is plotted vs. the parallax effect @xmath38 .",
    "if we remember that the ratio of the projected kinetic to potential energy must be smaller than 1 to get bound orbits , and that this ratio is proportional to @xmath176 , where the proportionality constant depends on @xmath38 as given by equation  [ eqn : gamma0 ] , it is easy to interpret these diagrams .",
    "when @xmath38 increases , the proportionality factor decreases , so that if @xmath175 remains small enough , the bound orbit condition is respected . in the @xmath174 diagram ( left side ) , small values of @xmath38 ( say below 0.17 ) have a proportionality factor larger than 1 . as @xmath175 is nearly 1 for these solutions , they are ruled out , and the light curve confirms it , as few small @xmath61 solutions ( black and red points ) lie there .",
    "larger @xmath38 are also excluded , as they correspond to large @xmath175 values , although the light curve would favor such solutions .",
    "the only surviving region in this diagram is around @xmath177 , corresponding to lens masses of half a solar mass , where the proportionality factor is about 0.4 and @xmath175 slightly exceeds 1 .    in the @xmath137 diagram ( right side ) , although this is slightly disfavored by the light curve ( @xmath178 for the best chain without the circular orbit constraint ) , there is a region where @xmath175 is about constant at 0.7 for @xmath38 varying from 0 to 0.4 .",
    "the bound solutions correspond to the larger values of the @xmath38 domain ( smaller proportionality factor ) , and they therefore agree with the range found in the @xmath174 diagram .",
    "we therefore conclude that both solutions agree , and give bound orbits when the lens mass is about half solar , corresponding to a lens distance of about 1.6  kpc .",
    "if we now move to the post - bayesian analysis , we see that this solution favored by the light curve has some tension with the galactic model constraint , because nearby lenses are rarer than more distant ones .",
    "but if we move to more distant lenses , we get many chains with unbound orbits or high eccentricities . by the way , the @xmath174 solution , which has a lower @xmath61 than the alternate @xmath137 solution , is also the one where more chains correspond to unbound orbits .",
    "there is therefore a tension between galactic and keplerian priors , and the issue will only be solved photometrically , by measuring the light coming from the source and the lens .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming article about this event .",
    "we conclude by giving the 1-d distributions of lens mass , lens distance , and planet orbit semi - major axis .",
    "the mass function for the lenses involved in these plots include main - sequence stars , brown dwarfs , but also white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , which may have large masses without violating the lens flux limit constraint . for the ms and bd stars , we adopt the following slopes of the present - day mass function @xmath179 : @xmath180 between 0.03 and 0.7 @xmath28 , @xmath181 between 0.7 and 1.0 @xmath28 , and @xmath182 above . for the remnants ,",
    "we adopt gaussian distributions , whose mean value , standard deviation , and fraction of total mass with respect to ms and bd stars below @xmath183 are given in table  [ tab : massdist ] .",
    "lllr wd & 0.6 & 0.07 & 22/69 + ns & 1.35 & 0.04 & 6/69 + bh & 5.0 & 1.0 & 3/69    for details about the choice of these numbers , please refer to @xcite .    in each diagram",
    "( see figure  [ fig:1dplots1 ] for mass and flux , and figure  [ fig:1dplots2 ] for distance and semi - major axis ) , the black curves show the full mass function , while the red curves show the mass function truncated at @xmath184 . for ms stars ,",
    "this limit is imposed by the lens flux constraint , and will be refined once we obtain the adaptive optics photometry of the individual stars in the field .",
    "wd at this mass are extremely rare ; jovian planets around pulsars ( ns ) have not been found , despite very extensive searches ; and super - jupiter planets orbiting bh are a priori unlikely .",
    "let us first consider the lens mass distribution : the no - flux - limit ( black ) curve shows a huge spike at expected ns position and a smaller bump corresponding to bh .",
    "note that for these bumps , the @xmath137 solution dominates , despite its @xmath61 handicap .",
    "this is because the galactic model very strongly favors distant lenses , primarily because of the volume factor , and this overwhelms the modest preference of the light curve for nearby lenses . because @xmath23 is roughly fixed , these distant lenses are massive .",
    "this preference is much stronger in the @xmath137 solution , which can be seen in its rapid rise beginning at @xmath185 .",
    "note that the wd peak ( at @xmath186 ) is clearly visible , especially in the @xmath174 solution .",
    "the lens distance distribution basically looks at this same situation from the standpoint of distance .",
    "the new notable feature is that both ms and ns peaks are in the disk , while the bh bump is in the bulge . and the semi - major axis distribution peaks at about 2 - 3 au .",
    "> from these diagrams , we can estimate a most probable value of lens mass , distance and semi - major axis , and an asymmetric standard deviation read at 50% of the distribution corresponding to the red bold curves .",
    "we get a star and planet mass of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , at a distance of @xmath6  kpc , and with a semi - major axis of @xmath7  au .    as a final note",
    ", it could be said that more complex models are worth exploring : the geometry of the caustic crossing , where the source passes close to the three - cusps tail of the caustic , is extremely sensitive to a third body ( second planet or binary companion to the lens star ) .",
    "a similar geometry where two planets were detected is described in @xcite .",

    "the numerical kernel has been introduced in image subtraction by @xcite .",
    "one of the regular problems encountered in difference image analysis is the choice of the best possible reference image",
    ". for astrometry , the best seeing image is generally a good choice , if the sky background is not too high . for photometry",
    ", it is our experience that stacking good images improves the result , but only if these images have been acquired during a short time slot , to avoid light variations of the target and slow variations due for instance to small changes in the flat - field . in order to choose good reference images",
    ", we use a suite of astromatic software @xcite , namely sextractor and psfex .",
    "sextractor builds catalogues of sources from all images of a given telescope , with their characteristics , and psfex derives a model of the psf of these images , from which we extract a few numbers to estimate the image quality ( seeing , ellipticity , number of stars ) .",
    "this allows an almost automatic selection of the templates , with a final verification by eye to check the selected images .",
    "once the images have been subtracted using these templates , the photometry of the target is done by iteratively centering the psf on the light maximum close to the center of the image .",
    "this method enables the photometering of faint stars in the glare of nearby much brighter stars .",
    "the standard procedure of rescaling error bars so that the @xmath187 of each telescope data set is of order unity is acceptable if the resulting error bars roughly correspond to the dispersion of the data points at a given time for this data set .",
    "there is therefore an interplay between finding the correct model and rescaling the error bars , because a too large rescaling factor reduces the constraint from a given data set and allows the model to shift from the correct one .",
    "our procedure has been to use rescaling factors which look plausible given the telescope size and site quality , trying to get a @xmath187 of order unity only if the dispersion in successive data points is well reproduced by this rescaling scheme .",
    "this generally involves two parameters to modify the original photometric error bars @xmath188 .",
    "one is a minimal error @xmath189 to reproduce the dispersion of very bright ( or in this case , highly magnified ) sources due to fundamental limitations of the photometry , such as flat fielding errors .",
    "the other is the classical multiplicative rescaling factor @xmath190 .",
    "the adopted formula is : @xmath191    the balance between both rescaling factors is given by comparing the cumulative distribution of @xmath187 , ordered from magnification given by the model , to a standard cumulative distribution for gaussian errors .",
    "an example for ogle and moa distributions is given in figure  [ fig : cumul ] .",
    "table  [ tab : two ] gives the adopted values of both parameters for each telescope .",
    "it must also be noted that for some amateur telescopes , data were binned before this rescaling process .",
    "finally , after the initial modeling was conducted , it was realized that three data sets could not accommodate the condition @xmath192 ( auckland and vlo ) or a positive source flux ( perth ) .",
    "they were therefore removed and the final models are based on 16 data sets .",
    "it is generally difficult to treat the limb - darkening effect accurately , because it varies from one telescope data set to the other , primarily due to the different photometric bands involved .",
    "second - order effects include hardware - specific variations of the spectral response ( filters , ccds ) , and for very broad bands , the atmospheric and interstellar extinctions .",

    "since @xmath202 is very similar to @xmath125 , this reflects the degeneracy between the perpendicular components of earth orbital motion ( parallax ) and lens orbital motion , which is analyzed in some detail by @xcite and @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the correlation is quite tight .",
    "the top panel shows the lens mass @xmath204 . since @xmath23 is nearly constant for different links in the chain , the mass scales @xmath205 and so is peaked near @xmath206 where @xmath38 is near its minimum ( see figure  [ fig : bayes1 ] ) .      note that @xmath210 is the ratio of the so - called projected kinetic to projected potential energy , which has a strict upper limit of unity for bound orbits .",
    "we do enforce this limit , but the main impact of the orbital motion is more subtle .",
    "first look at @xmath208 . in the region",
    "away from @xmath211 , we have both @xmath212 ( equation  [ eqn : gamma0 ] ) and ( very roughly ) @xmath213 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "hence , @xmath208 is approximately constant in these two regimes .",
    "much of the @xmath214 region is at or above the physical limit @xmath215 , which is why these values are disfavored in figure  [ fig : bayes1](c ) .",
    "now examine @xmath207 . by itself",
    ", @xmath216 does not vary much with @xmath202 , so the form of the structure is basically just @xmath217 , which scales @xmath218 away from zero .",
    "the point is , however , that the overall scale ( which is set by the measurement of @xmath216 ) is small , so that except near @xmath211 , @xmath207 is extremely close to zero .",
    "naively , this would seem to be disfavored by the virial theorem , but how does the jacobian `` know '' about this ?",
    "for simplicity of exposition let us consider circular orbits .",
    "for these , @xmath219 implies that the planet is exactly in the plane of the sky : either the orbit is exactly face - on ( so this is always true ) , or the orbit just happens to be passing through the plane of the sky at the time of the event peak .",
    "the jacobian is `` unhappy '' about either alternative because there is very little kepler - parameter space relative to chain - variable space at such orbital configurations .",
    "finally , note that in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath211 ( where @xmath27 reaches its highest values ) , @xmath220 is frequently at or above its physical limit ( @xmath221 ) , which is exacerbated by the relatively high values of @xmath216 .",
    "this is reponsible for the modest suppression of extremely low parallaxes ( high masses ) in figure  [ fig : bayes1 ] .",
    "thus , both kepler and galactic+flux priors separately predict a relatively high lens mass , near the limit of what is permitted by the flux constraint ."
