    "it is clear from this figure that the effect of the on - site interaction at this temperature is just to introduce damping .",
    "since this is a region where isdw appear at low temperature , the fermi surface can be destroyed by lowering the temperature or increasing @xmath0 .    , @xmath58 , @xmath64 , @xmath26 and @xmath66 .",
    "the dashed green line is the brillouin zone . ]    for better understanding , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_16 ] the spectral function as a function of frequency at different wave vectors for the same parameters as in the previous figure .",
    "these are energy dispersion curves ( edc ) .",
    "one can clearly observe the quasi - particle dispersion relation , the effect of @xmath0 appearing as damping .",
    "the extra features at higher frequency are precursors of extra bands that would appear in the ordered state .",
    "indeed , the edc are plotted in a regime where the correlation length associated with incommensurate fluctuations is three to four lattice spacings ( @xmath97 ) , enough to enter the renormalized classical regime . a simple generalization of an argument presented earlier  @xcite shows that in that regime , the self - energy can be approximated by @xmath98 where the sum runs over all the equivalent maxima of the susceptibility , six of them for the present case .",
    "substituting this expression into the general result for the spectral weight@xmath99 one can reproduce qualitatively the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig_16 ] . with larger correlation length ( larger @xmath100 ) , the spectrum clearly splits into more bands .",
    "the spin fluctuation induced precursor effects are also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_18 ] that displays the density of states for various values of @xmath0 and for densities near @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath101 curve is close to the non - interacting result . for stronger interaction , the extra band of states",
    "can be understood as a precursor effect by drawing the density of states for a static modulation .     for @xmath26 , @xmath66 .",
    "]    the fact that renormalized classical spin fluctuations can create a pseudogap on the fermi surface in two dimensions is well documented so we do not show a figure corresponding to this case . we present the case of a fermi surface pseudogap that originates from charge fluctuations . increasing @xmath1 enough that cdw1 fluctuations become important , one can observe a pseudogap , as seen in @xmath96 for @xmath58 , @xmath64 , @xmath102 and @xmath66 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_15 ] .",
    "the pseudogap opens up at the @xmath103 point , in other words the spectral function at this point is suppressed . by analogy with the spin - fluctuation induced pseudogap , the symmetry equivalent @xmath103 points are nearly connected by the symmetry equivalent wave vectors @xmath104 of the cdw1 charge instability .    , @xmath58 , @xmath64 , @xmath102 and @xmath66 ]    the edc corresponding to this situation",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_17 ] .",
    "it is clear again from this figure that the pseudogap opens up around the @xmath103 point where the suppression occurs in the mdc of fig .",
    "[ fig_15 ] . for other points",
    "the peak positions change only slightly .",
    "we have used etpsc to clarify the leading instabilities of the extended hubbard model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the method is valid from weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "it satisfies the mermin - wagner theorem , includes quantum ( kanamori - bruckner ) renormalization of the vertices and does not assume a migdal theorem for the self - energy .",
    "we interpret the entry into the renormalized classical regime ( exponential growth of the correlation length ) as an indication of the phase that acquires long - range order at zero temperature .",
    "since we scan all wave vectors for both spin and charge instabilities , our method is not biased towards a restricted set of instabilities as most other studies .",
    "superconducting instabilities , however , have not been explored .",
    "the range of possible phases as a function of on - site interaction @xmath0 , nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath1 and filling @xmath91 is quite rich . notwithstanding superconducting instabilities , negative values of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "favor charge instabilities either at zero wave vector ( phase separation ) when @xmath0 dominates , or at the cdw1 and cdw2 wave vectors when @xmath1 dominates .",
    "in the physically more relevant regime where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both positive , spin instabilities are favored when @xmath0 dominates and they occur at wave vectors that are essentially determined by the fermi surface .",
    "that is particularly clear at large fillings where the shape of the fermi surface is non - trivial .",
    "larger @xmath1 , on the other hand , favors charge instabilities that are generally determined by the vertex itself instead of by details of the fermi surface .",
    "this is particularly clear at small filling where the fermi surface is essentially circular .",
    "that predominance of the vertex is why the cdw2 ( @xmath2 ) phase , for example , exists over a wide range of fillings and is not favored by commensurate fillings .",
    "we find that this cdw2 phase can compete with spin instabilities , especially ferromagnetism , when @xmath0 is large as well .",
    "ferromagnetic fluctuations appear in a range of doping similar to that observed for the cobaltates . that competition with ferromagnetism has not been taken into account in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "all the phases , except the fermi liquid one , appear at large values of the interactions when filling is small , somewhat outside the regime of validity of our approach . nevertheless , agreement with other approaches suggest that etpsc extrapolates in a reasonable way towards strong coupling . the disappearance of all phases except the fermi liquid one at small coupling and small fillings ( @xmath14 ) on the triangular lattice is a clear manifestation of the effects of frustration , as can be seen by contrasting with the square lattice case  @xcite ( @xmath68 ) where this does not occur .",
    "finally , we also showed that charge - density wave thermal fluctuations can also induce a pseudogap .",
    "a pseudogap associated with cdw is observed  @xcite experimentally . if its origin is the one discussed in the present paper , it should disappear as temperature rises above that where the charge correlation length becomes of the order of the thermal de broglie wave length  @xcite , as observed in the spin fluctuation case in electron - doped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "further studies should include the competition with superconducting fluctuations as well as more realistic modeling of the specific materials to which one wishes to apply our results .",
    "for example , the @xmath106 case is relevant for the layered organics .",
    "computations were performed on the elix2 beowulf cluster in sherbrooke and on the ms cluster of the rseau qubcois de calcul haute performance ( rqchp ) .",

    "<S> several new classes of compounds can be modeled in first approximation by electrons on the triangular lattice that interact through on - site repulsion @xmath0 as well as nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath1 . this extended hubbard model on a triangular lattice has been studied mostly in the strong coupling limit for only a few types of instabilities . using the extended two - particle self consistent approach ( etpsc ) , that is valid at weak to intermediate coupling , we present an unbiased study of the density and interaction dependent crossover diagram for spin and charge density wave instabilities of the normal state at arbitrary wave vector . when @xmath0 dominates over @xmath1 and electron filling is large , instabilities are chiefly in the spin sector and are controlled mostly by fermi surface properties . </S>",
