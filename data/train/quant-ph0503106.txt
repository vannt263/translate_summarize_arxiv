    "compared to entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics , and is profoundly important in quantum information .",
    "to identify the fundamentally inequivalent ways quantum systems can be entangled is a major goal of quantum information theory [ 3 ] . it might be thought that there is nothing new to be said about bipartite entanglement if the shared state is pure , but in a recent paper [ 4 ] it has been shown that exact coherence of the atom is in general never regained for a two - level model with a general initial pure quantum state of the radiation field",
    "also , it has been shown that the purification of the atomic state is actually independent of the nature of the initial pure state of the radiation field .    from the viewpoint of the phoenix - knight",
    "[ 5 ] entropy formalism , the quantum field entropy and entanglement of a coherent field interacting with a three - level systems have been investigated [ 6 ] .",
    "however , the method used in those papers can not be applied when the system is taken to be initially in a mixed state . a method using quantum mutual entropy to measure",
    "the degree of entanglement in the time development of the two - level system model has been adopted in [ 7 ] .",
    "the question of how mixed a two - level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in the course of the time evolution according to a jaynes - cummings type interaction has been considered [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "it is important to point out that further insights into the dynamics of the multi - level systems may be helpful in developing quantum information theory [ 12 ] .",
    "recently , there is much interest in multi - level quantum systems to represent information [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "it was demonstrated that key distributions based on multi - level quantum systems are more secure against eavesdropping than those based on two - level systems [ 13 ] .",
    "key distribution protocols based on entangled three - level systems were also proposed [ 16 ] .",
    "the security of these protocols is related to the violation of the bell inequality .",
    "the multi - level system provides in this context a much smaller level of noise [ 17,18 ] .",
    "rydberg atoms crossing superconductive cavities are an almost ideal system to generate entangled states , and to perform small scale quantum information processing [ 19 ] . in this context entanglement generation of multi - level quantum systems",
    "was also reported [ 12,20 - 23 ] .    motivated by recent experiments we analyze the entanglement degree of a multi - level system . using an appropriate representation and without using the diagonal approximation , an explicit expression for a mixed state entanglement is derived . in the present work we consider the situation for which the multi - level system is initially in a mixed state .",
    "we essentially generalize the entanglement degree due to the quasi - mutual entropy , usually employed in the two - level system , to the multi - level system interacting with a cavity field . the physical situation which we shall refer to",
    ", belongs to the experimental domains of cavity quantum electrodynamics .",
    "nd give exact expression for the unitary operator @xmath0 involved",
    "we start by devoting this section to a brief discussion onbeing it the model describing the interaction between a single multi - level atom and a quantized cavity field . to set the stage , we first begin by describing the multilevel - atom model .",
    "therefore , the physical system on which we focus is an @xmath1-level .",
    "the atom interacts with a high q - cavity which sustain a number of modes of the field with frequencies @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the annihilation and creation operators for the field mode j , and @xmath5 is the frequency associated with the level of the atom .",
    "we assume that the mode i affects the transition between the upper atomic level and the level ( i+1 ) . therefore in the rotating wave approximation",
    "we can cast the hamiltonian of the system in the form [ 24 ] ( @xmath6 @xmath7 where the hamiltonian for the interacting system @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 the interaction hamiltonian between the atomic system and the cavity field is given by @xmath10 the transition in the @xmath1-level atom is characterized by the coupling @xmath11 .",
    "the operator @xmath12 describes the atomic population of level @xmath13 describes the transition from level @xmath14 to level @xmath15 .",
    "we have applied the rotating wave approximation discarding the rapidly oscillating terms and selecting the terms that oscillate with minimum frequency .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian may be written as @xmath16 we have used @xmath17 . here",
    "we assume that the detuning parameter @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 it can be shown that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants of motion , @xmath22=[\\hat{h},\\hat{h}_{0}]=0.\\ ] ] we assume that , before entering the cavity , the atom is prepared in a mixed state .",
    "mixed states arise when there is some ignorance with respect to the system , so that consideration has to be given to the possibility that the system is in any one of several possible states , @xmath23 , each with some probability , @xmath24 , of being realized . to this end",
    ", the initial state of the atom can be written in the following form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of quantum information processes , an understanding of mixed states is essential , as it is almost inevitable that the ideal pure states will interact with the environment at some stage .",
    "also we suppose that the initial state of the field is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the probability distribution of photon number for the initial state . the continuous map @xmath31 describing the time evolution between the atom and the field is defined by the unitary operator generated by @xmath32 such that @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "bearing these facts in mind we find that the evolution operator @xmath35 takes the next from @xmath36 \\exp \\left ( -i\\int_{0}^{t}\\hat{h}_{1}dt\\right ) .\\ ] ] where @xmath37 the first two factors in equation ( 11 ) produce phases that will not affect the results that follow , while calculations of the third factor show that it takes the following compact matrix form    @xmath38 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the single element matrix @xmath40 which takes the following form @xmath41 the matrix @xmath42 is the @xmath43 row matrix @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 its hermitian conjugate . finally the matrix @xmath47 is the @xmath48 square matrix @xmath49 of which the elements can be written as @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 having obtained the explicit form of the unitary operator @xmath0 , we are therefore able to discuss the entanglement of the system .",
    "entanglement is recognized nowadays as a key ingredient for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and as a basic resource of quantum information processing [ 1 ] .",
    "quantifying the amount of entanglement between quantum systems is a recent pursuit that has attracted a diverse range of researchers [ 5 - 15 ] .",
    "when we look at the entanglement of the mixed state as a whole , can we still calculate the relative entropy of entanglement ?",
    "this is in general very difficult to do for multipartite mixed states , and some partial methods for upper bounds have only been presented recently . in this section",
    ", we will apply the results obtained previously to derive the entanglement degree for a single multi - level atom interacting with a cavity field without using the diagonal approximation method adapted in [ 8,9 ] . with a certain unitary operator ,",
    "the final state after the interaction between the atom and the field is given by @xmath53 therefore the von neumann entropy of the total system is given by @xmath54 taking the partial trace over the atomic system , we obtain @xmath55 then the von neumann entropy for the reduced state @xmath56 is computed by @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the solutions of @xmath59=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 matrices having the following elements @xmath63 _ { ij } & \\equiv & \\langle \\psi _ { i}(t)|\\rho _ { t}^{f}|\\psi _ { j}(t)\\rangle , \\quad ( i , j=1,2,3, ... m^{2 } ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\hat{n(t)}\\right ] _ { ij } & \\equiv & \\langle \\psi _ { i}(t)|\\psi _ { j}(t)\\rangle , \\quad ( i , j=1,2,3, ... m^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath64 are the eigenfunctions of the following eigenvalue problem @xmath65    on the other hand , the final state of the atomic system is given by taking the partial trace over the field system : @xmath66 then the von neumann entropy for the reduced state @xmath67 is computed by @xmath68 where @xmath69 can be calculated by obtaining the eigenvalues of the reduced atomic state . using the above equations , the final expression for the entanglement degree in the @xmath1-level system takes the following form @xmath70 with the help of equation ( 23 ) it is possible to study the entanglement degree of any @xmath1-level system when the system starts from its mixed state .",
    "as a function of the scaled time .",
    "the mean photon number @xmath71 , and the detuning parameter @xmath18 has zero value , where , from bottom to top depicts three- , four- and five - level atom , respectively .",
    ", width=415 ]    .",
    ", width=415 ]    this seems significant , and one then wonders whether the trend might continue with the general multi - atom ( or ions ) case .",
    "that is , whether one might be able to consider more than one atom and still be able to measure the entanglement degree using quasi - mutual entropy .",
    "also , one might wonder whether a similar effect could carry over to different field states .",
    "that would be very nice because one could contemplate different protocols for different initial states of the field . to go a step further towards a deterministic entanglement degree , we note a peculiar effect in the present paper :",
    "we get more entanglement with increasing @xmath1 ( number of levels ) . indeed in the limit that @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath73 the entanglement degree is only twice of the quantum field ( atomic ) entropy . in the general case ( @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 )",
    ", the final state does not necessarily become a pure state , so that we need to make use of @xmath77 in order to measure the degree of entanglement in the present model .",
    "thus our initial setting enables us to discuss the variation of the entanglement degree for different values of the parameter @xmath78 of the initial atomic system .",
    "@xmath79 has been discussed in [ 8,9 ]    in figure 1 , we plot the function @xmath77 which describes the entanglement degree in the case when the field is initially in a coherent state squeezed state with a mean photon number @xmath80 and the mixed state parameters @xmath81 . in this case",
    "we see that , the entanglement degree function oscillates around values nearly equals the maximum values ( 2@xmath82 ) .",
    "let us remark that , in the pure state case , the von neumann entropy is limited by @xmath82 , and then @xmath83 reduces to 2@xmath82 . from this figure",
    "we can say that the maximum value of entanglement degree @xmath77 is increased as the number of levels is increased .    nevertheless , the minimum values lie within the region between the two maximum values occurring in a similar way for different number of levels , such that with higher @xmath1 the minimum values of the entanglement degree occur at earlier times .",
    "in fact , for some higher values of @xmath1 there were no persisting periods found to lie between the maximum and minimum values .",
    "these results strongly indicate that the higher number of levels give higher entanglement as well as more oscillations .",
    "figure 2 , indicates that when the mean photon number is increased further the minimum values of the entanglement occur at later times .     as a function of the scaled time . in this figure",
    "we consider the fock state with @xmath84 , where , from bottom to top depicts three- , four- and five - level atom , respectively .",
    ", width=415 ]    in figure 3 , we consider the entanglement degree as a function of the scaled time with the field initially in a fock state .",
    "the fock state of the electromagnetic field is very difficult to produce in experiments .",
    "nevertheless , these states are very important in quantum optics because of their intrinsic quantum nature .",
    "this case is quite interesting because the entanglement degree function oscillates around the maximum and minimum values in time .",
    "we have shown here a new phenomena where the periodic oscillations occur irrespective of number of atomic levels involved .",
    "this reflects the various influences of the initial states of the field . a slight change in @xmath85 therefore , dramatically alters the entanglement .",
    "it should be noted that for a special choice of the initial state setting , the situation becomes interesting where we find that a higher multi - level atom interacting with an initially coherent field exhibits superstructures instead of the usual first - order revivals .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dynamics of quantum multi - level systems has always been of interest , but has recently attracted even more attention because of application in quantum computing .",
    "several systems have been suggested as physical realizations of quantum bits allowing for the needed control manipulations , and for some of them the first elementary steps have been demonstrated in experiments [ .",
    "summarizing , we have shown how to determine the maximum and minimum possible values of the entanglement degree for multi - level atoms interacting with a cavity field .",
    "the forms of states that achieve these maximum and minimum values are the same as those for the case of the von neumann entropy if we consider the pure state case .",
    "these results are applicable for measuring the entanglement for mixed states in any multi - level systems .",
    "we have identified the relation between the entanglement measures that is necessary for these mixed states setting .",
    "this relation holds between the quasi - mutual entropy and von neumann entropy .",
    "the general formula we have derived may carry over to any multi - level system .",
    "for the examples we have examined the entanglement degree for three- , four- and five - level atoms , we have found that as the number of levels increases the maximum values of the entanglement degree also increases , but these values are achieved for earlier times when the number of levels is increased accordingly .",
    "an open and very interesting question is whether the quasi - mutual entropy technique that we have described here can be transferred to other systems in which atomic and cavity decays are present . in those systems it may be possible to augment or simplify the definition of the quasi - mutual entropy making its applications more accessible .",
