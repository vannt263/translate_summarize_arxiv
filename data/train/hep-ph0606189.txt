    "very recently , the precise di - muon measurement in heavy ion indium - indium collisions by na60 @xcite collaboration provided an exceptional probe to observe vector mesons in excited vacua .",
    "the masses of vector mesons in excited vacua , have been extensively modelled , with different results , since brown and rho @xcite proposed the scaling of the light - light vector mesons with the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "notice that tachyons may also occur .",
    "when there are only mesons in the vacuum , the vacuum is a minimum .",
    "it is then stable when the minimum is absolute , or metastable when the minimum is local because then the vacuum can decay through tunnelling .",
    "however when both mesons and tachyons occur , the vacuum is a saddle point .",
    "the tachyons indicate the decay directions of the vacuum , and thus the vacuum is unstable , it is a false vacuum . here",
    "i compare the mesons and tachyons in the false chiral invariant vacuum and in the true vacuum , in the framework of a chiral invariant and confining potential .",
    "notice that , in the true vacuum of qcd , quarks are confined . on the other hand , in the excited vacuum , chiral restoration is expected .",
    "therefore a framework with a confining and chiral invariant quark interaction is convenient to study mesons and tachyons in the two vacua .",
    "the present study , with confinement , upgrades our knowledge of vacua and of vacuum fluctuations in hadronic models .",
    "for instance vacua properties of the non - confining sigma model @xcite and nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite have been explored in detail @xcite , including suprising unstabilities led by the t hooft @xmath0 breaking determinant @xcite . in the simplest scenarios ,",
    "the vacua manifold of these models has the well known mexican hat shape , where the chiral invariant unstable vacuum has a finite number of tachyons .",
    "the tachyons in the flavour su(2 ) sigma model occur in the scalar @xmath1 and in the pseudoscalar @xmath2 channels .",
    "so in the sigma model there are four tachyons in the false chiral invariant vacuum , while in the true chiral symmetry breaking vacuum there is one massive meson , the scalar @xmath1 and three pseudoscalar mesons @xmath2 . in the chiral limit",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are goldstone bosons , in the borderline between mesons and tachyons .",
    "however , when quarks suffer a confining potential , the tachyon structure of the false chiral invariant vacuum possibly differs from the one of the sigma model or the one of the nambu and jona - lasinio model . in the true vacuum ,",
    "the confining quark models have an infinite number of states in each channel , while the sigma model of the nambu and jona - lasinio model only have a finite number of mesons . other differences also occur .",
    "le yaouanc et al .",
    "@xcite found that , even at high temperatures , the confining potential prevents a phase transition from the chiral symmetry breaking vacuum to the chiral invariant vacuum .",
    "le yaouanc , oliver , ono , pne and raynal , @xcite also found that , with a harmonic confinement , there is an infinite tower of excited vacua , interpolating between the true chiral symmetry breaking vacuum to the highest chiral invariant vacuum .",
    "this result was recently generalized to any confining potential by pb and nefediev @xcite .",
    "the existence of tachyons in the chiral invariant vacuum of a confining quark model was already signalled by le yaouanc , oliver , ono , pne and raynal , @xcite . here",
    "these tachyons are studied in detail .    because the present problem is quite technical , and because it is not clear yet what is the best chiral invariant and confining quark model , for clarity i now use the framework of the simplest confining and chiral invariant quark model @xcite .",
    "notice that a calibration problem exists in chiral computations .",
    "the full hadron spectrum remains to be correctly reproduced .",
    "when the quarks were discovered , it was realized that the main difficulty of the quark model consisted in understanding the low pion mass .",
    "but nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite had already shown that the spontaneous dynamical breaking of global chiral symmetry provides a mechanism for the generation of the constituent fermion mass and for the almost vanishing mass of the pion .",
    "this mechanism was extended to the quark model by le yaouanc , oliver , ono , pne and raynal with the salpeter equations in dirac structure @xcite and by pb and ribeiro with the equivalent salpeter equations in a form @xcite identical to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) equations of llanes - estrada and cotanch @xcite",
    ". these chiral quark models also comply with the pcac theorems , say the gell - mann oakes and renner relation @xcite , the adler zero @xcite , the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , or the weinberg theorem @xcite .",
    "possibly a chiral quark model with the correct spin - tensor potentials will eventually reproduce the full spectrum of hadrons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this is only a quantitative problem , qualitatively the simple model used here is sufficient to study several implications of chiral symmetry and confinement .",
    "recently , the full mesonic spin - tensor potentials of the present simple model were determined for a quark and an antiquark with different isospin @xcite . here",
    "i exactly solve these boundstate equations of mesons and tachyons in different vacua .",
    "importantly , the hamiltonian of this model can be approximately derived from qcd , @xmath3 up to the first cumulant order , of two gluons @xcite , which can be evaluated in the modified coordinate gauge , @xmath4 \\label{potential}\\ ] ] and this is a simple density - density harmonic effective confining interaction .",
    "@xmath5 is the current mass of the quark .",
    "the infrared constant @xmath6 confines the quarks but the meson spectrum is completely insensitive to it .",
    "the important parameter is the potential strength @xmath7 , the only physical scale in the interaction . in the true chiral symmetry breaking",
    "vacuum @xmath8 gev fits reasonably the hadron spectra .",
    "however in the chiral invariant vacuum the potential strength @xmath7 is supposed to be greatly suppressed . for simplicity ,",
    "i will consider a vanishing light quark @xmath5 and all physical results will scale only with the potential strength @xmath7 .",
    "i now address the meson and tachyon spectrum in different vacua . in section",
    "ii the quark mass gap equation and the bound state quark - antiquark equation are reviewed . in section",
    "iii the mass gap and boundstate equations are solved numerically and the spectrum is studied in an arbitrary interpolation between the true and the chiral invariant vacuum . in section",
    "iv the tachyons solutions of the boundstate equation are analytically studied .",
    "these first studies are performed at vanishing temperature .",
    "however in heavy ion collisions finite temperatures are reached , sufficient for a qcd phase transition .",
    "the conclusion is presented in section v , including the estimation of temperature effects on the spectra .",
    ".[algebraic ] matrix elements of the spin - dependent potentials [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "assuming a confining potential , the mass @xmath9 spectrum of mesons is studied in the true chiral symmetry breaking vacuum and in the unstable vacuum where chiral symmetry restoration occurs .",
    "the only parameter is the strength @xmath7 of the potential .",
    "chiral models have the same number of meson states in the spectrum as the normal quark model .",
    "the mass splittings can de related , as usual , to spin - tensor potentials . in the limit of vanishing constituent quark masses , all spin - dependent potentials are quite simple , proportional to @xmath10 .    in the chiral limit",
    "the mesons suffer small @xmath11 changes from one vacuum to the other , except for the @xmath12 pseudoscalars and scalars .",
    "all the @xmath12 mesons , including all possible radial excitations , are transformed in tachyons with infinite imaginary masses , when the true vacuum is replaced by the chiral invariant vacuum . an detailed analytical proof and a precise numerical study of the tachyons",
    "are also presented here .",
    "my first comment concerns the calibration problem of any chiral symmetric model .",
    "the sigma model , the nambu and jona - lasinio model and chiral lagrangian estimations are not confining and thus are not expected to address correctly hadrons with spin , angular or radial excitations .",
    "the present model is adequate to study the angular or radial excitations of hadrons , and in this sense it already upgrades previous estimations of the meson spectra in the chiral restored vacuum .",
    "nevertheless the present density - density interaction suffers from uncalibrated spin - tensor potentials .",
    "but i submit that the under development chiral invariant quark models with a confining funnel interaction @xcite a vector interaction @xcite , or long range scalar interactions @xcite , can be correctly calibrated .",
    "nevertheless , for a qualitative study , the present density - density harmonic confining interaction should be sufficient , since pb and nefediev @xcite have shown that this interaction has similar mass gap solutions to the other possible confining potentials in coulomb gauge qcd .",
    "my second comment concerns the parameters of the present model .",
    "the potential strength @xmath7 , the dominant scale of the present study , is expected to change from the ordinary qcd vacuum to the deconfined phase of qcd . this is quite important because the meson masses scale with @xmath7 .",
    "mys first conclusion concerns corrections due to the current quark mass .",
    "the light current quark mass is small but not vanishing .",
    "the @xmath13 or @xmath14 quarks correspond to and increase the chiral limit quark constituent mass by 1% to 2% of @xmath15 , while the @xmath16 quark amounts to increase the chiral limit quark constituent mass by up to 50% .",
    "for instance in the true vacuum the @xmath16 constituent quark mass is of the order of 1.5 @xmath15 , while in the chiral restored vacuum the @xmath16 constituent quark mass is of the order of 0.5 @xmath15 .",
    "these simple factors are sufficient to estimate from the figs .",
    "[ light - light ps ] , [ light - light va ] , [ heavy - light ps ] and [ heavy - light va ] , the masses of the vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , or of the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath20 and @xmath21 , relevant for the new di - muon measurements of na60 . in the light - light systems , with a @xmath13 or @xmath14 quark and a @xmath22 or @xmath23 antiquark , the number and the imaginary mass of pseudoscalar and scalar tachyons are not infinite , nevertheless they are very large .",
    "interestingly , in fig .",
    "[ light - light va ] the vector meson has real mass for zero quark masses , but for a small mass the vector meson is a tachyon . thus it is possible that the @xmath17 meson , or the @xmath18 meson , simply disappear in the chiral restored vacuum . because the quark mass interval , where the vector meson is a tachyon , is quite small , it is plausible that the @xmath17 meson and the @xmath18 meson may have a different tachyonic behaviour , although the present study can not explore the differences between the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 .",
    "notice that the na60 collaboration saw differences between the production rate of the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 @xcite , but this may also be due to @xmath17 interactions with @xmath24 at the periphery of the deconfined qcd bubble @xcite .",
    "my second conclusion is that the chiral invariant vacuum is too unstable to be reached , unless confinement is lost .",
    "this is clearly signalled by the infinite , ( or very large ) number of infinite ( or very large ) imaginary mass of tachyons in the pseudoscalar and scalar channels .",
    "this extreme unstability confirms a result of le yaouanc et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the deconfinement transition , using the present confining potential , and concluded that the transition does not occur for any finite temperature .",
    "therefore a change in the potential must happen before the chiral restoration transition occurs .",
    "this also confirms the lattice qcd simulations initiated by kogut , wyld , karsch and sinclair @xcite , and the schwinger - dyson calculations initiated by bender , blaschke , kalinovsky and roberts , @xcite who also found a restoration of chiral symmetry coincident with the loss of confinement at temperatures of the order of 150 mev .",
    "the third conclusion of this paper is that all the meson masses are much smaller in the high temperature chiral invariant vacuum , than they are in the low temperature symmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "notice for instance that the apparently constant vector and axialvector masses of fig .",
    "[ heavy - light va ] are proportional to the potential strength @xmath7 , thus they decrease when the potential strength decreases .",
    "this is an educated conclusion , based on lattice qcd simulations of the dependence of the confining potential with temperature and also with dynamical fermions .",
    "when confinement is lost , @xcite at temperatures of the order of 150 mev , the strength of the potential is also decreased .",
    "these two effects are necessary for chiral symmetry restoration .    assuming these two changes , both in shape and strength of the potential , the spectra computed in this paper can be reinterpreted .",
    "assuming that confinement disappears , the infinite number of infinite imaginary mass tachyons go away .",
    "moreover , a smaller strength of the potential is also necessary to remove any tachyon in the chiral symmetric vacuum .",
    "then the chiral symmetric vacuum is the only and true vacuum .",
    "notice that , for light quarks , the largely dominant scale , including the scale ruling the constituent quark mass , is the strength of the potential .",
    "all the spectra are proportional to the strength of the potential , see figs [ light - light ps ] , [ light - light va ] , [ heavy - light ps ] and [ heavy - light va ] .",
    "then , with a much weaker potential , the masses and widths of any possible mesons are much smaller ( except for the contribution of the heavy quark mass , say the @xmath25 mass in @xmath20 or @xmath21 mesons ) than the masses of ordinary mesons listed by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "thus the vector mesons identified by the na60 collaboration , with masses close to the ordinary masses , are not expected to be probed inside the deconfined phase of qcd , where all mesons , if any , are much lighter .",
