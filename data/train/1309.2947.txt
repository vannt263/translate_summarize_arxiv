    "galactic synchrotron radiation is produced by cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and positrons propagating in interstellar magnetic fields ( b - fields ) .",
    "synchrotron emission is one of the major galactic components from several hundred mhz to several hundred ghz . in the microwave band",
    "free - free and dust emission tend to dominate making more difficult the separation of the components .",
    "advanced modelling of the different emissions , both total and polarized components is important for separating synchrotron emission from other components .",
    "synchrotron modelling requires a knowledge of the galactic b - fields and cr electrons in the galaxy .",
    "hence , observations of this diffuse emission and comparison with models is a fundamental tool for studying b - field , cr electrons and their propagation and distribution in the galaxy .",
    "it is known that there are at least two components of the galactic b - field : regular and random @xcite .",
    "however its intensity and configuration are still uncertain , despite large amounts of rotation measure ( rm ) data for pulsars and extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "information on the b - field using synchrotron emission came from early studies @xcite , followed by more recent ones @xcite .",
    "@xcite used radio surveys of total synchrotron emission , polarized synchrotron emission in the galactic plane and rms , and constrained the relative contributions of the coherent , ordered random and isotropic random components of the magnetic field , constructing a new model of some complexity . @xcite selected two benchmark models , fitting different b - fields to the observed rms .",
    "@xcite , instead , derived their best - fitting model including also a striated component .",
    "@xcite produced 3d models of the galactic magnetic field including regular and turbulent components only .",
    "recently , @xcite produced a model of the all - sky emission in the _ planck _ satellite frequency ranges with a regular component following a bi - symmetrical spiral formulation and a turbulent component .",
    "the additional component , in addition to the random and the regular b - fields , has been included by several authors in recent works .",
    "this anisotropic random component refers to a large scale ordering of the b - field , which originates by stretching or compression of the random field @xcite .",
    "this component is expected to be aligned to the large scale regular field , with frequent reversal of its direction on small scales @xcite .",
    "radio observations of galaxies suggest that its intensity is stronger in the regions between the optical spiral arms @xcite , due to the shifting of the dynamo field with respect to the density wave producing the spiral arms .",
    "however the proof of its existence is model dependent and its structure is still not known .",
    "this component is not traced by rms , but it contributes both to the polarized and unpolarized synchrotron emission .    constraining random and anisotropic random b - fields",
    "is possible using the combination of polarized and unpolarized observation of the synchrotron emission , realistic cr electron spectra and distributions , and models of the b - field , combined with rms of pulsars and extragalactic sources .    in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "hereafter soj2011 , we focussed on the total synchrotron spectrum only at high galactic latitudes , from which we derived information on the electron spectrum and the total b - field .",
    "we tested propagation models based on cosmic - ray and gamma - ray data against synchrotron data from 22 mhz to 94 ghz .",
    "we were thus able to put constraints on the total b - field intensity and propagation parameters .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum from this paper was used by @xcite as a foreground in deriving the final nine - year _ wmap _ cosmological parameters .    here , we start from the implementation of synchrotron emission in galprop as described in soj2011 , and we extend the study to the whole galaxy .",
    "the novelty in this paper is the modelling and use of polarization , as well as the treatment of absorption and free - free emission .",
    "spectral and spatial studies are performed . for our spatial study and for the estimation of polarized emission ,",
    "the 3d propagation scheme is necessary .",
    "this is the first time the 3d option has been extensively used with the galprop code ( most previous works assumed radial dependence only , hence symmetry in x and y ) .",
    "in addition to the description of the modelling improvements , in this paper we use galprop to calculate the radio emission of some illustrative models .",
    "the models are created using existing b - field models and realistic propagation models that are adjusted to match cr observations and gamma - ray data .",
    "we compare our prediction to radio data and investigate how a few selected parameters affect our results .",
    "we present galactic profiles and skymaps , changing one parameter at a time , so that we fully understand the effects of different parameters and their degeneracy .",
    "we address the following three main questions : do such models resemble the data ? what can be learned from simple modifications of the parameters ?",
    "how degenerate are they ?",
    "we use recent cr electron and positron measurements by _ fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite and realistic cr source distributions in the galaxy based on recent gamma - ray data analyses @xcite .",
    "no energy equipartition approximation between cr electron density and strength of the b - field is assumed .",
    "for the first time , models of both total and polarized synchrotron emission have been investigated in the context of cr propagation in a self consistent manner , with other recent observations such as gamma rays and cr measurements . for a given b - field and propagation model",
    "we start with a cr source distribution and follow the propagation of all the particles , primary protons , helium , electrons and positrons , taking into account secondary production , and diffusion of particles and their energy losses throughout the whole galaxy .",
    "we then compare the model results with cr measurements at earth and radio data .",
    "the contribution of secondary electron and positrons to synchrotron is included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we introduce new developments in the galprop code and give a description of the implemented b - field models .",
    "then , we describe the method , present the results and discuss the effects of varying different model parameters .",
    "galprop is a numerical code for modelling the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy and calculating the diffuse emissions produced during their interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) and radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "its objective is to assist in interpreting observations of gamma rays , crs , and theism in a self - consistent way .",
    "description of the galprop software can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the galprop explanatory supplement is available at the dedicated websitegalprop.stanford.edu ] ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "galprop is also used by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration for interpreting the observations of the galactic interstellar gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "it simultaneously predicts crs , gamma rays , and also synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "galprop solves the transport equation for all required cr species , given a cr source distribution and boundary conditions .",
    "it takes into account diffusion , convection , energy losses and diffusive reacceleration processes .",
    "secondary crs produced by collisions in the ism and decay of radiative isotopes are included .",
    "the propagation equation is solved numerically on a user - defined spatial grid in 2d or in 3d , and energy grid .",
    "the solution proceeds until a steady - state solution is obtained from the heaviest primary nucleus to electrons .",
    "positrons and anti - protons are then computed as well .",
    "galprop models gamma - ray emission of pion decay , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton for a user - defined cr source distribution and cr spectra .",
    "gas maps and isrf are provided and updated to the most recent observations @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we describe the implementations on the galprop code for calculating both polarized and unpolarized synchrotron radiation in the radio band .",
    "we also include radio absorption and a preliminary free - free emission model , so that , with respect to soj2011 , we are now able to model the emission also in the plane , where absorption at low frequencies is important . all the calculations reported here are performed with the 3d mode of galprop .",
    "given a spectrum of electrons or positrons computed at all points on the 3d grid and a b - field , galprop integrates over particle energy to get the synchrotron emissivity .",
    "the emissivity as seen by an observer at the solar position is computed and output as a function of ( x , y , z , @xmath0 ) ( for the 3d case ) .",
    "the spectrum and distribution of the emissivity depend on the form of the regular and random components of the b - field , and the spectrum and distribution of cr leptons . to obtain the synchrotron intensity galprop integrates over the line - of - sight the calculated emissivity on the sky grid .",
    "the resulting synchrotron sky maps for a user - defined grid of frequencies are output in galactic coordinates either as cartesian projection ( car ) or in healpix .",
    "we have implemented the stokes parameters in galprop following the description for the formulae as in the hammurabi software @xcite .",
    "the emissivities for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the total emissivity , @xmath5 is the polarized emissivity , @xmath6 is the unpolarized emissivity . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the perpendicular and parallel components , relative to * b * , of the synchrotron emissivity , as described in soj2011 .",
    "@xmath9 is the angle between the polarization direction of the electric vector and the galactic longitude meridian ( n - s ) , computed from the geometry of * b * at each point .",
    "unpolarized radiation has @xmath10 , totally polarized has @xmath11 .",
    "we integrate the emissivities over the line of sight to produce the corresponding synchrotron sky maps of @xmath12 and @xmath2 ; @xmath13 is computed from @xmath14 , and the polarization angle from @xmath15 .",
    "we use the same convention for @xmath16 and @xmath2 as in @xcite .    because the emission is polarized perpendicular to the projection of * b * onto the line of sight , the polarization vector is directed along @xmath17 ( n.b . @xmath18 for synchrotron radiation ) . with this definition of @xmath9 , * b * parallel to the galactic plane has @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while a projected * b * pointing towards the north galactic pole has @xmath21 and @xmath20 . *",
    "b * at @xmath22 to the meridian has @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and at @xmath25 to the meridian @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the formulation here is more general than that often used , which gives the stokes parameters directly in terms of the components of * b * ( e.g. , @xcite , _ wmap _ ) .",
    "the latter is valid only under the assumption of a power - law cr electron spectrum with an index of 3 , while ours is valid for any electron spectrum .",
    "the simplified formulae are useful for understanding the relation between the topology of * b * and the stokes parameters , and for checking the software .",
    "these relations are as follows :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 are the horizontal and vertical components respectively of the projection of * b * on to the plane perpendicular to the line of sight to the observer , @xmath30 is the line - of - sight distance and @xmath31 is the cr electron flux at @xmath30 .",
    "the projection of * b * implies that @xmath32 is non - zero for latitudes @xmath33",
    "even if there is no vertical component of * b * ; a consequence is that @xmath2 changes sign from positive to negative latitudes .",
    "note that polarized emission is not sensitive to b - reversals , and hence neither is galprop .      in soj2011",
    ", we extended galprop with a 3d description of the galactic b - field , for regular and random components . in our model",
    "of the galactic b - field , @xmath34 is galactocentric distance ( @xmath35 kpc is the location of the sun ) and @xmath36 is the azimuth angle measured anticlockwise from the galactic centre - sun direction .",
    "our reference system is right - handed , with the galactic centre at @xmath37 and the sun in the @xmath38 direction .    in the galprop coordinate system ,",
    "the components of the b - field projected on to the @xmath39- and @xmath40- axes are @xmath41    the radial and azimuth components are defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the pitch angle .      our knowledge of the galactic b - field is still very limited . the b - field intensity is measured using zeeman spectral - line splitting , optical polarization data and faraday rms of pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "rms depend on the regular b - field component and the thermal electron density along the line of sight .",
    "the thermal electron distribution is usually based on the ne2001 model @xcite , which is known be an inadequate approximation @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach is to use information from synchrotron emission both polarized and total .",
    "this is dependent on the knowledge of cr spectra and distribution in the galaxy .",
    "another more physical approach is based on galactic dynamo models @xcite .",
    "the regular b - field models used here are a few sample of simple models from the literature and based on rms , where the analytical formulation is given in the original papers , so that it can easily be included in our code . for illustration",
    ", we show the three regular b - field models used in this work .",
    "* model 1 : as in @xcite and @xcite for disc and halo components . in their papers , the disc field was constrained by rms near the galactic plane ( @xmath44 ) and the halo field by an all - sky compilation of rms of extragalactic sources . for the disc field",
    ", we took their axisymmetric spiral ( ass ) model plus reversals in rings ( ass+ring ) , which best fitted their data . * model 2 and model 3 : as the logarithmic spiral models of the disc component from @xcite and their benchmark parameters .",
    "after fitting different b - field models ( based on sun s models ) to the latest set of rms , they found that a spiral disk and an asymmetric halo fits the data best , while the ring model is disfavoured .",
    "we consider both their best - fitting ass ( defined here as model 2 ) and bisymmetric spiral ( bss ) ( defined here as model 3 ) models and their halo fields with their benchmark parameters .",
    "model 2 has pitch angle @xmath45 , while model 3 has @xmath46 .",
    "model 2 has the same b - field intensity for the halo component in the northern and southern hemispheres , while in model 3 the intensity in the southern hemisphere it is half of the one in the north ( which is the the same as in model 2 ) .    for all these three disc models ,",
    "the local b - field intensity is the same , @xmath47  @xmath48 g , as constrained by rms . for the halo b - field",
    ", we used @xcite for model 1 and @xcite for model 2 and 3 with their best - fitting parameters .",
    "their halo field follows the double - torus field as described in @xcite .",
    "generating and maintaining a disc and a halo field of different parity in the same galaxy is under debate @xcite .",
    "even if polarized emission is not sensitive to reversals , we used the models exactly as in the literature .",
    "the models are illustrated in figures  [ fig_halo ] and [ fig_disc ] .",
    "note that they all have zero vertical component of the field .",
    "for the regular disc component ( fig .",
    "[ fig_disc ] ) , for the same b - field local intensity @xmath49 , there corresponds a different maximum value for each model , which affects the modelled synchrotron intensity distribution .",
    "the intensity of the random field is assumed to have the form @xmath50 where the values of the parameters ( @xmath51 ) can be freely chosen . in soj2011",
    "we were able to constrain the @xmath52 field on the basis of the unpolarized synchrotron data , radio survey data and the measurement of the electron spectrum by _",
    "fermi_-lat @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameters ( @xmath51 ) found to fit the 408 mhz synchrotron longitude and latitude profiles were @xmath53 g for the local b - field and the scalelengths were 30  kpc in @xmath34 and 4  kpc in @xmath54 .",
    "these values were obtained adopting the @xcite and @xcite models for the regular b - field , with no attempt to fit the polarization data .",
    "in fact the original @xcite value of @xmath55 g everywhere underestimated the total synchrotron emission .",
    "the shape of the random b - field is chosen to better resemble the intensity of the galactic synchrotron emission as already introduced in soj2011 .",
    "we have also included an anisotropic random component , which follows the same topology of the regular field , as in @xcite .",
    "we assume here the anisotropic random component to be aligned with the local regular field but changing direction randomly on small scales .",
    "this component contributes to the polarized and total synchrotron emission , but not to the rms .",
    "synchrotron emission is affected by absorption by ionized hydrogen .",
    "this is important at lower frequencies , but it also slightly affects the 408 mhz data in the galactic plane .",
    "hence , in our computation with galprop , we have also introduced a model for absorption . as a result",
    ", we can produce a synchrotron model for the whole sky and compare it with data for each frequency used .",
    "we use the formulae given in @xcite ( chapter 5.9 ) for the free - free opacity ( k@xmath56 ) and emissivity ( e@xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 with g@xmath56(@xmath0 , t@xmath58)=10.6  +  1.9  log(t@xmath58 )  -  1.26  log@xmath59(@xmath0 ) .",
    "absorption is a function of the electron temperature t@xmath58 and the clumping factor since it depends on the square of the electron density .",
    "the clumping factor is related to the filling factor : for equal - size clouds , clumping factor = 1/filling factor .",
    "clumping factors in the range 10 - 100 are typically based on a variety of data ( pulsar dispersion measures , h@xmath60 emission , free - free emission and synchrotron absorption )",
    ". estimates for t@xmath58 vary between 1000 and 9000 k @xcite .",
    "note that free - free absorption follows the same function of the temperature and the clumping factor as free - free emission .",
    "free - free emission contributes to unpolarized radio emission at frequencies above few ghz in the galactic plane .",
    "hence , in order to model the total radio emission , a template of free - free emission is necessary .",
    "even though available to estimate this emission component , the _ wmap _ free - free template is not suitable , because it overestimates the free - free emission , presumably due to contamination by the anomalous dust emission , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we have introduced our preliminary model for free - free emission in galprop , which will be constrained together with the synchrotron emission itself in future studies .",
    "the free electron density implemented in galprop uses the model described in @xcite and @xcite , with the broad ionized component updated according to @xcite .",
    "we use the smooth part of the model only and do not model the spiral structure aspects .",
    "future developments should include a more sophisticated model of the warm ionized medium , e.g. @xcite . in this paper an electron temperature of 7000 k and a clumping factor of 100 are assumed .",
    "this clumping factor was chosen so that the model resembles the total _",
    "intensity in the inner galaxy , in the presence of the other emission components .",
    "we use the free - free emission model for completeness and illustration only .",
    "no attempt is made to study in detail its parameters , and our conclusions are not affected by different choice of the parameters .",
    "note also that free - free emission is subject to absorption as well as the synchrotron emission , and this is included in our model .",
    "radio surveys used throughout this paper are extensively described in soj2011 .",
    "we provide here a brief summary .",
    "we use the full - sky 408 mhz survey ( haslam et al .",
    "1982 ) , after correcting it for cmb , extragalactic non - thermal component and zero - level by subtracting 3.7k , as found by @xcite .",
    "other surveys were obtained directly from their authors , and others from the bonn and lambda websites .",
    "the combined zero - level and extragalactic / cmb corrections were taken from the literature as stated here : 22  mhz - dominion radio astrophysical observatory northern hemisphere survey : .",
    "45  mhz - north : , south : , combined all sky : @xcite .",
    "an offset of 550k was subtracted @xcite .",
    "150  mhz - parkes - jodrell bank all - sky survey : @xcite .",
    "1420  mhz - stockert - villa eliza all - sky survey .",
    "north : , south : .",
    "an offset  of 2.8k was subtracted @xcite .",
    "2326 mhz - rhodes southern hemisphere survey : @xcite .",
    "in addition to these data , total and polarized data at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94 ghz _",
    "wmap _ seven - year data were obtained from the lambda website @xcite ; see the appendix for the identification and properties of the datasets actually used here .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "mcmc templates are used for dust and spinning dust .",
    "the @xcite total synchrotron maps are used to compare our model to the total synchrotron .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "synchrotron templates were used as a cross - check .",
    "we use @xmath13 to constrain the magnitude of the ordered ( regular plus anisotropic random ) b - field induced by noise in @xmath16 and @xmath2 is addressed in the appendix . ] ; however , separation into @xmath16 and @xmath2 stokes parameters is also presented , since this is useful to probe the field topology . above 23  ghz ,",
    "the polarized emission has both synchrotron and thermal dust contributions .",
    "hence , for completeness we include also the template of polarized dust from _ wmap _ in our plots .",
    "however , we use only 23  ghz to draw conclusions on the polarized synchrotron emission , since at this frequency the polarized dust emission is much less than the synchrotron .",
    "the total @xmath61 also requires the inclusion of other components : free - free , dust and spinning dust .",
    "hence , _ wmap",
    "_ templates for the dust and spinning - dust emission are used , since they are important especially in the galactic plane .",
    "we use @xmath61 in the _ wmap _ frequency ranges for illustration only , since it is not used to draw conclusions on the b - field .    for our spatial analysis",
    "we focus mainly on the 408  mhz and 23  ghz data ; the 408  mhz map traces the total b - field and reflects mainly the synchrotron component , while the free - free emission is a minor component .",
    "the 23  ghz polarized map traces the synchrotron emission related to the ordered ( regular plus anisotropic random ) b - field , while the polarized dust component is minor .",
    "we start by using the plain diffusion model of cr propagation as in soj2011 .",
    "this propagation model describes both cr , gamma - ray and synchrotron spectral data @xcite .",
    "the initial model has a halo height of 4 kpc , and is based on injected spectra and cr source distribution from @xcite .",
    "cr injection spectra for nuclei and primary electrons are the same as those used in @xcite for their plain diffusion model ( lmpds ) , as given in the supplementary material of that paper .    for the original models described in section [ bregular ] with intensities of the regular b - field fixed to the values given in the cited publications , our computed synchrotron emission does not match the polarized data at 23 ghz , where the emission can be considered totally synchrotron . in fact ,",
    "the expected emission is largely underestimated for all three b - field models described above .",
    "figure [ fig_sun_original ] shows as an example , the polarized spectra for model 1 for the inner galaxy and high latitudes .",
    "the energies of cr electrons responsible for synchrotron emission at that frequency are essentially exempt from the effect of solar modulation . hence , assuming that cr electrons throughout the galaxy are reasonably modelled by galprop , this provides evidence for the presence of an additional synchrotron component .",
    "we attribute this emission to be produced by an anisotropic random component , in agreement with recent work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the electron spectrum used by @xcite and @xcite is a factor of 2 higher than the one used in our analysis .",
    "this could partly explain why they obtained agreement with the polarized synchrotron data with no inclusion of the anisotropic random b - field .",
    "note that , the inclusion of an additional component of the ordered ( regular plus anisotropic random ) b - field is tested in the 23 ghz map , where solar modulation is negligible , so the electron spectrum is known from direct measurements .",
    "we investigate the contribution of the anisotropic random component and quantify it in section [ results ] .",
    "we consider the intensity of the regular b - field fixed to the values reported in the respective papers .",
    "no attempt is made to scan over all the parameters or to construct new b - field models .",
    "initially , we compute each model with reference values for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 derived by approximate eye fits to polarized spectra in the inner galaxy , where the p - bias is lower ( see the appendix for discussion of p - bias ) .",
    "the intensity of the halo field is adjusted maintaining the original scaling factor between the disc and the halo components of the regular b - field .",
    "the initial random b - field is then adjusted to match the 408 mhz map in the plane .",
    "after a first approximation given by eye fitting , we started the fitting as follows .",
    "although , the fitting could be performed by using multiple galprop runs with varying parameters , this is not necessary , and a simpler approach is fast and flexible , giving the same results .",
    "the sum of the regular and anisotropic random field scaling is determined using @xmath13 at 23 ghz .",
    "then , the random field scaling is determined using @xmath61 at 408 mhz , accounting for the part @xmath65 attributed to the fitted regular plus anisotropic random b - field ( polarized fraction from regular field @xmath66 ) .",
    "the free - free contribution at 408 mhz ( around 10% in the inner galaxy ) is also subtracted from the @xmath61 data before fitting .",
    "an offset term accounts for zero level uncertainties , and p - bias in the case of polarized intensity . also for the 408 mhz data",
    "an offset has been fit . after the intensity normalization for @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath61 has been fitted , the corresponding b - field is obtained using the fact that @xmath67 , @xmath68 ; the @xmath69 relation is a good approximation for an electron spectral index 3 , which is the case for electron energies ( @xmath7010 gev ) producing the synchrotron at these frequencies .",
    "we then rerun the models with the best - fitting values to provide a check on the procedure , with further fitting iterations if required .",
    "we use a simple @xmath71 minimization , in order to make the fit and obtain the best values .",
    "this is done on a healpix grid , which has uniform solid angle bins not requiring any weighting .",
    "the measurement error on the data points is assumed constant .",
    "for the 408 mhz analysis , the data were sampled on the galprop model order-6 healpix grid , with 49152 data points , resolution @xmath72 . for _ wmap _ , the number of data points is 3145728 , corresponding to the order-9 healpix ( pixel size 6 ) data provided by _",
    "wmap_. since we use the @xmath73 smoothed _",
    "data , @xmath71 is effectively scaled up by a constant relative to independent pixels , but this was considered more reliable than resampling on the galprop model grid .",
