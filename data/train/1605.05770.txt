    "as an electro - optical modulator we consider a nonlinear crystal of the length @xmath3 placed between the metal electrodes parallel to the direction of propagation ( the @xmath4 axis ) . radio frequency wave ( microwave ) excited between the electrodes propagates through the crystal along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the microwave mode is characterized by the wavenumber @xmath5 and the frequency @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the phase velocity of the mode .    as is illustrated in fig .",

    ", the well - known picture suggests that , owing to the linear electro - optic effect in the nonlinear crystal , the externally applied microwave field modulates the phase of the optical wave producing a multimode output observed as the multiple sidebands that a single optical carrier develops after modulation  @xcite .",
    "the modulation process thus involves interaction of different optical modes mediated by the microwave field and the traveling modes appear to be coupled .",
    "the strength of the microwave - field - induced intermode coupling is mainly determined by the two factors : ( a )  the electro - optic coefficient and ( b )  the overlapping coefficients represented by the averages of a product of the spatial distributions of the modes and the microwave field over the volume of interaction .",

    "the electro - optically induced interactions generally falls within the realms of the parametric processes in nonlinear quantum systems and the theoretical technique developed in early studies on this subject  @xcite can be invoked to model them .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian of the photons written in the following form : @xmath15 where a dagger will denote hermitian conjugation , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the photons in the microwave mode , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the optical photons numbered by the mode number @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the bare intermode coupling constant ( interaction parameter ) and @xmath22 is the normalized function describing the mode number dependence of the intermode interaction strength , @xmath23 . note that in our notations the polarization index has been dropped .",
    "it implies that all the modes are assumed to be linearly polarized along a principal axis of the crystal and we shall restrict our considerations to the geometry where the state of polarization remains intact .",
    "formula   presents the hamiltonian with the three - boson interaction written in the rotating wave approximation .",
    "this approximation assumes that the intermode interaction is dominated by the quasiresonant terms that commute with the operator of the linear momentum : @xmath24 and are slowly varying in the representation of interaction ( they are proportional to @xmath25t)$ ] ) , whereas the non - resonant terms are of minor importance .",
    "they produce negligibly small effects and hence can be disregarded .",
    "another key assumption taken in our model is that the intensity of the microwave mode is sufficiently high for its quantum properties to be ignored .",

    "<S> the model assumes that the number of interacting modes is finite and effects of the mode overlapping coefficient on the strength of the intermode interaction can be taken into account through dependence of the coupling coefficient on the mode characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , under certain conditions , the model is exactly solvable and , in the semiclassical approximation where the microwave field is treated as a classical mode , can be analyzed using the technique of the jordan mappings for the @xmath0 lie algebra . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are applied to study effects of light modulation on the frequency dependence of the photon counting rate . in the limiting case of infinitely large number of interacting modes , we find that these effects can be described in terms of the well - known modulating phase factor and the intensities of sidebands computed as a function of the coupling constant demonstrate depletion of the initially pumped mode with the photons spreading over the large number of the photonic states . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , when the number of interacting modes is finite , the sideband intensities reveal strongly non - monotonic behavior supplemented with asymmetry of the intensity distribution provided the pumped mode is not central . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish the conditions of validity of the semiclassical approximation by applying the methods of polynomially deformed lie algebras for analysis of the model with quantized microwave field . </S>"
