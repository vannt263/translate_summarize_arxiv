    "lattice qcd calculations predict a transition from confined hadronic matter to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons at a critical energy density @xmath1 around 0.6  gev/@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such energy densities are believed to be reached at cern sps energies and indeed evidence for a new state of matter created in pb - induced reactions at the sps has been announced recently  @xcite . it is expected that the reaction dynamics could differ considerably if energy densities close to or above @xmath1 are reached , and that the existence of a phase transition could manifest itself in the space - time evolution of the system  @xcite . in particular , the beam energy dependence of quantities characterizing the space - time evolution may give hints to the onset of deconfinement in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition , the beam energy range available at the sps provides an important link between the nucleon dominated domain at the ags and the pionic regime at collider energies , leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms relevant for thermal freeze - out .    while single particle momentum distributions are also determined by the space - time evolution , the lifetime and the spatial extent of the system as well as the existence of collective velocity fields at the time of thermal freeze - out can be disentangled by the study of bose - einstein ( be ) momentum correlations of identical pions via hanbury - brown and twiss interferometry ( hbt ) .",
    "the width of the correlation peak at vanishing relative momenta reflects the so - called length of homogeneity of the pion emitting source . only in static sources",
    "can the length of homogeneity , in the following also called ` source radius ' , be interpreted as the true geometrical size of the system . in a dynamic system , the occurence of space - momentum correlations of the emitted particles due to collective expansion generally leads to a reduction of the observed source radii .",
    "the degree of reduction depends on the gradients of the collective expansion velocity and the thermal velocity of the pions at thermal freeze - out .",
    "a differential analysis of the hbt correlations in bins of the pair transverse momentum thus provides valuable information not only on the spatial extent but also on the properties of the collective expansion of the system  @xcite .",

    "this opening angle corresponds to a spatial distance of about 3  cm at the entrance of the tpc .",
    "our studies have shown that the extracted source radii change only within their statistical errors if the two - track separation cut is varied between 6 and 10  mrad .",
    "correlations in momentum space are caused not only by quantum statistics but also by final state interactions , the most important one being the mutual coulomb repulsion .",
    "since this is a two - body process , it depends only on the relative momentum of the pair in its rest frame @xmath37=@xmath38 . to account for this ,",
    "we parametrized the @xmath37-dependent coulomb correlation function @xmath39 derived by integration of the coulomb wave functions over a gaussian source of 5  fm size  @xcite . in the next step , the impact of the finite detector resolution of @xmath40=5 - 10  mev / c ( see below ) on @xmath39 was evaluated using a monte - carlo simulation .",

    "[ coulomb ] .     as function of @xmath37 before and after smearing with the momentum resolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    in most of the previous hbt analyses",
    "the coulomb correction was carried out by applying @xmath37-dependent weights to each pair in the background distribution @xmath35 .",
    "afterwards , the coulomb - corrected correlation function @xmath32=@xmath41 was normalized in the region of large @xmath26 and fit by a gaussian parametrization , which then should describe the pure be correlation peak .",
    "this approach assumes that all particle pairs in the signal distribution are subject to the coulomb correlation , which is in general not true under realistic physical and experimental conditions . in the following , we argue that physics and detector related effects lead to a reduction of the observed be correlation strength , usually expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath15 , and that the same effects also lead to a similar reduction of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the strength of the coulomb correction applied to the data should be linked to the experimentally observed @xmath15 parameter .",
    "a reduction of the observed be correlation from its theoretical value of two at vanishing relative momentum can be caused by coherent pion production , pions from long - lived resonances and weak decays , particle misidentification , and finite momentum resolution .",
    "we assume that the contribution from coherent pion production is negligible because the observed pion phase space densities at sps energies  @xcite are too low to expect a significant degree of coherence of pion production .",
    "pions from long - lived resonances such as the @xmath42(782 ) add a tail to the density distribution of the pion source , which then results in a narrow spike of the correlation function at very small relative momentum . due to the finite momentum resolution of the detector the spike can not be resolved .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the observed @xmath15 parameter .",
    "since the effective source size of pions emerging from these resonances is large , their mutual coulomb interaction can be assumed to be negligible .",
    "the same arguments apply for pions from weak decays of e.g.  @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a contamination of the track sample by particles other than pions leads to pairs of like - sign non - identical particles .",
    "they obviously do not contribute to the be correlation , but they experience coulomb repulsion .",
    "however , due to their different masses , the strongest coulomb correlation for those pairs does in general not occur at @xmath26=0 in the lcms , which is calculated assuming the pion mass , but at finite @xmath26 away from the pion be peak .",
    "we have evaluated this for the ceres acceptance and @xmath43 and @xmath44 pairs . in any case , we conclude that the contribution to coulomb correlation of non - identical pairs is weak , since the measured correlation functions are flat around the corresponding @xmath37 .",
    "note that pairs containing electrons or positrons do not contribute to coulomb correlations because most of them stem from decays or conversions far away from the interaction region .",
    "pairs of identical particles which are not pions can give rise to be and coulomb correlations .",
    "however , a detailed comparison of the correlation functions of positive and negative like - sign pairs showed no significant difference of the extracted source radii and of the shape of the correlation functions at large @xmath26 , although the level of contamination by non - pion pairs is very different in the positive and negative pair sample ( see fig .  [ dedx ] ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the contribution of non - pion pairs to coulomb repulsion and be correlation is negligible .",
    "in essence , we argue that only those pairs which contribute to the measured be correlation strength also contribute to coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the applied coulomb correction should be scaled according to the observed @xmath15 parameter .",
    "since the value of the @xmath15 parameter is _ a priori _ unknown , we construct the correlation function from the signal and background distributions without coulomb correction , and include the effect of coulomb repulsion into the fit function : @xmath45 ,     \\label{c2para}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 the fit function contains the usual gaussian parametrization @xmath47 , with the gaussian source radii @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , and the cross - term @xmath51 which appears as a consequence of space - time correlations in non - boost - invariant systems  @xcite .",

    "the coulomb term @xmath53 contains the two - pion coulomb correlation function @xmath39 which was derived as described before .",
    "its application requires supplementary information about the average @xmath37 in each of the 10  mev / c @xmath27-bins , which was stored in separate arrays of the same bin size . following the above argumentation",
    ", the strength of the coulomb correction needs to be adjusted to the @xmath15 parameter . at this point",
    ", an additional complication arises due to the finite momentum resolution , which leads to a @xmath0 dependent reduction of @xmath15 by 13% to 45% , i.e.  @xmath15=@xmath54@xmath55@xmath56 .",

    "the parameter @xmath48 is approximately constant from ags to the lower sps energies , but starts to increase significantly within the sps regime and towards rhic , indicating a smooth increase of the lifetime .",
    "@xmath49 is gradually decreasing at small @xmath57 up to top sps energy , connected with a continuous flattening of the @xmath57-dependence . at rhic , @xmath49 is again larger than at the sps while the shape is not yet well measured .",
    "in fact , the @xmath128 sample indicates further flattening . naively , the flattening would indicate a decrease of the radial flow velocity as function of beam energy",
    "this is in contradiction to the present interpretation of single particle transverse mass spectra , which indicate an increase of radial flow with beam energy  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 shows a rather weak energy dependence and a slight minimum around the lowest sps energy , where we find @xmath50/@xmath49@xmath31 .",
    "an investigation of the freeze - out conditions can be performed by relating the measured source parameters to an effective freeze - out volume : @xmath129 computed for gaussian density distributions in all three spatial dimensions . in the presence of collective expansion , @xmath130 does not comprise the total volume of the pion source at freeze - out but rather reflects a volume of homogeneity .",

    "an approximately linear scaling with @xmath131 is indeed observed at all three energies . since the number of charged particles was found to scale close to linear with @xmath131 at sps  @xcite ,",
    "this is consistent with the assumption of a constant freeze - out density at a given beam energy .",
    "however , the observed beam energy dependence is at first glance surprising : the increase of pion multiplicity at midrapidity by about 70% from 40  agev to 158  agev  @xcite is not reflected in a corresponding increase of @xmath130 .",
    "obviously , the freeze - out volume scales with multiplicity as long as multiplicity is controlled via centrality , but it does not scale accordingly as multiplicity changes with beam energy .",
    "we note that , according to experimental results , the ratios of particle species change very little with centrality for not too peripheral collisions , whereas they change significantly with beam energy . in a separate publication",
    "@xcite we show that thermal pion freeze - out in general does not occur at constant density @xmath132@xmath133@xmath52/@xmath130 , if relative abundancies of hadrons change .",
    "this is due to the different cross sections of pions with e.g.  pions and protons , which explains that freeze - out occurs rather at constant mean free path @xmath134=@xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the effective cross - section of the system with pions , averaged over all particle species in the final state : @xmath136=1/@xmath137 .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of two - pion interferometry data at sps energies .",
    "we observe a smooth centrality and beam energy dependence of all hbt parameters ; no indications for drastic changes of the space - time evolution have been found .",
    "the data at all centralities and beam energies under investigation suggest the existence of a pion source which rapidly expands in longitudinal and transverse direction . assuming longitudinal boost - invariance , a duration of expansion of about 6 - 8  fm / c can be determined from the pair transverse momentum dependence of the longitudinal radius parameter @xmath48 , smoothly increasing with centrality and beam energy .",
    "the expansion is followed by a rather sudden freeze - out with a short duration of pion emission . at the time of freeze - out , the transverse r.m.s .",
    "radius of the system has increased by about a factor two compared to the dimension of the initial overlap region of the two colliding nuclei .",
    "this implies that the transverse area of the reaction has quadrupled .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of the parameter @xmath49 indicates a high degree of collectivity and a radial flow velocity of about @xmath75@xmath1250.55@xmath89 in the most central collisions .",
    "studying the beam energy dependence of @xmath48 , there is a monotonic increase from top ags energies to rhic . over the same range of beam energies",
    "there is a subtle but systematic flattening of the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath49 .",
    "more studies are needed to understand the origin of this effect .",
    "the centrality dependence of the effective freeze - out volume @xmath138 is consistent with the assumption of pion freeze - out at constant particle density .",
    "however , this simple picture breaks down if different beam energies are compared .",
    "the key to understand this effect is in the consideration of the cross sections of different particle species with pions , as the relative abundances change with beam energy .",
