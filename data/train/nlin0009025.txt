    "one of the most beautiful instances of statistical laws in biology is the species - area law , which relates the area @xmath0 of a habitat and the number of different species @xmath1 coexisting there . in its qualitative form , this law has already been stated by alexander von humboldt in the 19th - century : larger areas harbor more species than smaller ones ( see rosenzweig , 1999 ) .",
    "the most commonly used quantitative relation between number of species and area has the form of a power - law , [ saz ] s a^z .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 depends on the geographical characteristics of the region under consideration and on the taxon considered ( see , however , he & legendre , 1996 for a different view ) .    despite the large number of studies on biodiversity patterns , their relationship to underlying population dynamic models",
    "has hardly been explored until now .",
    "this is the scope of the present paper .",
    "we obtain scaling laws for biodiversity as a function of external control parameters like the immigration rate and the total amount of abiotic resources .",
    "relating these external parameters to the area of our model island , we obtain a species area relationship that compares favorably simplifito field data .    in this approach",
    ", biodiversity is established and mantained by an immigration flux , much like in the phenomenological theory of island biogeography ( macarthur & wilson , 1963 ) . at long times , the system always evolves to a statistically _ stationary state _ where immigrations and local extinctions balance .",
    "it is then characterized by a constant turnover of species , but global quantities do not change on the average , and ecological variables like the number of species , the number of trophic levels , the number of links per species or the species abundances attain a time - independent distribution .",
    "this state can be called a dynamical equilibrium ( macarthur & wilson , 1963 ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that a biosystem in this state is _ strongly driven _ : its biodiversity depends on a nonzero flux of immigrations .",
    "it can not be described by a given fixed point of population dynamics .",
    "the static description of ecosystems , very common in classical population dynamics , seems thus inadequate to model biodiversity .",
    "a large number of field studies support the functional relation given by eq .",
    "( [ saz ] ) , with exponents which range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 for nested areas in the mainland , in the interval @xmath5 for groups of nearby islands , go up to @xmath6 for archipelagoes , and range in @xmath7 for habitat islands ( rosenzweig , 1995 , begon _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "searching for an explanation of insular biodiversity patterns , macarthur and wilson ( macarthur & wilson , 1963 ) proposed in the sixties an equilibrium theory of island biogeography . according to this theory , the number of species on islands is the result of a dynamical balance between the arrival of new species ( immigration ) and local extinction .",
    "many field studies and statistical analysis of data have been carried out to define the applicability limits of the theory .",
    "they range from island defaunation experiments ( simberloff & wilson , 1969 ) and subsequent analysis ( simberloff , 1969 , heatwole & levins , 1972 ) to the study of insular biodiversity patterns ( gilpin & diamond , 1976 ) and of fluctuations of the number of species ( gilpin & diamond , 1980 , 1981 ; manne _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) . on the other hand , the lack of explanatory power of macarthur and wilson s theory has been criticized ( williamson , 1989 ; whittaker , 1992 ) , and corrections hav been proposed ( simberloff , 1969 ) .",
    "the major shortcoming in our view is that the approach is not explicitly founded on ecological dynamics .",
    "many authors have investigated the species - area relationship without relying on the equilibrium theory of island biogeography .",
    "a classical model was proposed by preston ( preston , 1962 ) , who derived a power - law relationship from the assumption that the abundance of species is characterized by a log - normal distribution .",
    "this assumption however has been questioned , since field study support broader distributions .",
    "recently , harte and collaborators obtained a power - law relationship between species diversity and area from the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of individuals is self similar with respect to the operation of cutting a small area from a larger one ( harte _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "thus their model applies to continental nested subareas .",
    "an analytical relation between the scale - invariant spatial distribution and the species distribution was subsequently derived ( banavar _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "still , the hypothesis of a self - similar distribution of abundances is a strong assumption , even if it seems supported by some field data .",
    "several recent models combine immigration or speciation and ecological dynamics , trying to overcome the major shortcoming of the previous approaches .",
    "wissel modelled an ecosystem of similar species ( wissel , 1992 ) .",
    "he combined the effects of environmental and demographic stochasticity together with interspecies competition thus obtaining a power law species - area relationship .",
    "durrett and levin proposed a model where speciation is coupled to contact dynamics to mimic ecological processes , obtaining nearly power law species area relationships ( durrett & levin , 1996 ) .",
    "( 1998 ) and drossel _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) coupled population dynamics to speciation and immigration processes to simulate changes in biodiversity over evolutionary times .",
    "loreau and moquet modelled immigrations of plant species from a large pool to an island ( loreau & mouquet , 1999 ) .",
    "they included explicit competition for space in the framework of the equilibrium theory . a recent model for species",
    "turnover has reproduced power law distributions for species abundances and species lifetimes as observed in field studies , providing moreover a mechanism for switching from power - law to log - normal distributions as parameters are changed ( sol _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the combination of a diffusion mechanism coupled to spatial noise ( and leading to local extinctions ) generates a power law relationship between number of species and area with exponent @xmath8 , even if interaction among species is not explicitly represented ( pelletier , 1999 ) .",
    "another class of models which combine immigrations and population dynamics is that of species assembly ( post & pimm , 1983 ; drake , 1990 ; case , 1990 ; morton & law , 1997 ; happel & stadler , 1998 ; schreiber & gutierrez , 1998 ) . in these models , a community is constructed through local immigrations from a regional species pool . after every immigration",
    ", the new community is tested for persistence ( _ i.e. _ , the property that no species gets extinct even in the limit of infinite time ) . imposing the condition of persistence",
    "bounds these models to the limit of very rare immigrations , while in our model the immigration rate plays the role of the essential control parameter .",
    "the classical view of ecosystems represents them as static ensembles of species at a stable fixed point of population dynamics . in this framework ,",
    "a key result is constituted by may s theorem ( may , 1972 ) .",
    "he showed that a large ecological system formed by @xmath1 species with a total number of @xmath9 random connections with average value zero and dispersion @xmath10 will have , with probability one , no stable fixed point if the variance of the interactions verifies @xmath11 . this result , which has been slightly corrected in more recent years ( cohen & newman , 1985 ) , sets an upper limit to the amount of complexity allowed by the stability condition , and breaks the traditional view of complexity as a force increasing ( static ) stability .    the representation of ecosystems as static entities was already challenged by macarthur and wilson s theory . according to them",
    "ecosystems are ever changing ensembles of species , evolving in a stationary state where the average number of species remains constant in time . in the same spirit , we take a dynamical view of ecological processes .",
    "we model immigrations to an insular ecosystem as a flux of species coming from a continent . starting from an empty island ,",
    "new species arrive at random and build the model food webs .",
    "this is a possible way of assembling the ecological community ( see also drake , 1990 ) .",
    "population dynamics leads ultimately to species extinctions , but the ecosystem stays in general far from any fixed point of the dynamics .    after a transient period , a statistically stationary state where extinctions balance new immigrations is reached . as will be seen ,",
    "this stationary state is rather far from static equilibrium : in fact , if the immigration rate is switched off , we observe that several species go rapidly extinct and the ecosystem reaches , more and more slowly as more species go extinct , a static fixed point with a very small number of species .",
    "although we used different models to describe immigrations and population dynamics , we observed that the main statistical features of the equilibrium state are the same for different descriptions .",
    "this makes us confident that our results are robust and fairly independent of the details of the modellization .",
    "the relationship between the time scale of the external driving ( the immigration rate ) and that of the internal ecological dynamics assumes in this context a key importance .",
    "if the typical time scale for immigrations is very large compared to the time scale for equilibration of the ecological dynamics , then a new fixed point is reached after every new arrival . in this case , immigrations act only as proposal of new species , but do not shape the ecosystem , whose properties will be independent of the immigration rate .",
    "if , on the other hand , the immigration of new species is very fast compared to the ecological dynamics , the ecosystem will be determined only by immigrations and will resemble a random assemblage of species . at intermediate time",
    "scales non trivial equilibria emerge and both immigrations and ecological dynamics play an important role . in this regime ,",
    "the average number of species in the stationary state , @xmath1 , increases as a power law of the immigration rate @xmath12 , si^a , [ s - i ] with values for the exponent typically in a narrow range , @xmath13 , depending on the system parameters",
    ".    we shall relate eq .",
    "( [ s - i ] ) to the species - area relationship in sec .",
    "[ area ] , where we assume that the immigration rate is proportional to the linear size of the island ( macarthur & wilson , 1963 ) .",
    "the corresponding exponent @xmath2 depends on parameter values , but is typically comprised in a narrow range , from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "these values are very close to those observed for biodiversity in whole archipelagos , when one single source of immigrants is considered .",
    "since our model does not consider spatial structure , it is implicitely assumed that our  island \" is either isolated or corresponds to a whole archipelago . in this case ,",
    "our results show a remarkable agreement with experimental data .",
    "it is thus tempting to speculate that the effect of area on biodiversity is largely due to the immigration rate , and that the exponent @xmath2 observed for islands of the same archipelago is smaller because also interchanges of species have to be considered .",
    "we shall argue that an approximately power law species - area relationship could be a generic feature arising from the ecological dynamics and the existence of a statistical stationary state , therefore independent of the details of the system .",
    "the immigration rate influences also other properties of the food webs : the number of trophic levels increases with @xmath12 , consistently with the observation that food chain length is positively correlated to the size of the ecosystem ( schoener , 1989 ) and with a recent simulation ( spencer , 1997 ) . also the number of links per species and the total biomass change with the immigration rate .",
    "the distribution of species abundances has a power - law shape , with an exponent close to @xmath16 and slowly decreasing with the immigration rate .",
    "the first result is in agreement with field observations ( pielou , 1969 ) , considerations based on the theory of multiplicative processes ( kerner , 1957 ; sornette , 1998 ; biham _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) and results from the simulations of a similar model ( sol _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) , and seems to be rather general .",
    "the distribution of species lifetimes has also , in an intermediate range , almost power law shape , with an exponent close to @xmath17 slowly decreasing with the immigration rate , as it should be expected .",
    "also in this case this is in agreement with field observations ( keitt & marquet , 1996 ; keitt & stanley , 1998 ) and with the results of the model by ( sol _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ibm ] we introduce an individual based model of ecological dynamics based on stochastic dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ l - v ] we present a formulation of ecological dynamics based on continuous deterministic models .",
    "since we are interested in the comparison between these two description levels , the results will be presented together in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "we conclude with an overall discussion .",
    "recently , population ecology has started to use individual based ( or individual oriented ) models ( ibm ) as a complementary tool in the study of ecological dynamics ( omnicki , 1999 ; grimm _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "one of the main interests of such approach is that it allows the explicit modelization of individual characteristics , like the age of the individuals in a population ( influencing the time of breeding or the moment at which they die ) , or the energy that they store and require to move and survive ( bascompte _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) .",
    "most ibm studies refer to concrete problems where a few species of known characteristics interact to produce a well defined behaviour or pattern , which the ibm should recover or predict ( fahse _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; spencer , 1997 ) .",
    "another interest of ibm is in what has been termed _ virtual ecology _ : the comparison between real data and simulated data obtained from a system where realistic restrictions have been considered might allow the design of better protocols for recruitment and observation ( berger _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; hall & halle , 1999 )",
    ".    simulations of very large systems with many individuals and/or many species have not been undertaken until recently because of computational limitations .",
    "thus the ibm approach was restricted to few species in relatively small lattices representing real space , with one to few individuals per lattice site .",
    "more ambitious problems , like the relation between theoretical results for deterministic continuous models and their ibm counterpart , were addressed only recently ( keitt , 1997 ) . some authors derived time - continuous models from the more basic description of the flow of energy between constituents ( svirezhev , 1997 ) or among individuals ( wilson , 1998 ; sol _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "this is indeed a very relevant point .",
    "one would expect that the coarse - grained higher - level description represented by deterministic models captures the essential features of lower - level individual - based models .",
    "this is in fact the phylosophy behind our approach : in the ibm , as well as in the higher - level models to be introduced in the forthcoming sections , we study the predictions of the model from a statistical point of view , ignoring details that will necessarily be different in different models .      consider a large area @xmath18 on which a maximum number @xmath19 of basal species coexist and up to @xmath20 animal species compete for resources .",
    "the ecological interactions in this community will be defined through a matrix with entries @xmath21 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 we will determine the trophic relationship between individual @xmath23 of species @xmath24 and individual @xmath25 of species @xmath26 , as we shall explain later .",
    "we have considered two possible algorithms to determine the non - zero elements of the interaction matrix .",
    "our first election corresponds to the cascade model ( cohen _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) , which returns a network with topological properties comparable to those of real ecosystems .",
    "in this case , the distinction between basal and animal species automatically arises from the ecological relationships given by the interaction matrix .",
    "we define @xmath27 to be the total number of species in the system .",
    "if the number @xmath28 specifies a peching order for feeding , the algorithm works as follows : any species @xmath24 can feed only on species @xmath26 which is lower in the order , that is , @xmath29 .",
    "this avoids the formation of loops .",
    "a link to any of the potential prey species is established with probability @xmath30 .",
    "if the value of @xmath31 is fixed ( according to real observations ) to be around four , this model returns the correct proportions of basal , intermediate , and top species , a maximum number of levels typically around ten , and a distribution of the number of predators per prey which agrees with field observations ( cohen _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) .    a second possibility for the interaction matrix consists in randomly assigning @xmath31 preys to each of the @xmath20 animal species",
    "this would correspond to a disordered situation where no processes have acted in order to select the topology of the ecological network . in this case , and only for implementation purposes , basal species occupy positions @xmath32 , and animal species occupy @xmath33 .",
    "the interaction matrix has the form    @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 indicate basal species and animals , respectively .",
    "the statistical properties of the system do not depend on the form chosen for the interaction matrix .",
    "as we will see , the relevant quantities take the same form in the cascade model case ( cm ) and in the random matrix case ( rm ) . for both algorithms , the values of the matrix elements",
    "are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 $ ] ( see table i ) .",
    "the value of the matrix coefficients is proportional to the energy gained by individual @xmath23 when feeding on individual @xmath25 and represents a sort of assimilation efficiency ( see below ) .    in determining the matrix @xmath9 ,",
    "we have essentially defined a structured ecosystem in a very large area with many species .",
    "this is what we consider to be the continent , which will be the source of immigration of propagules to an island of area @xmath39 .",
    "this last quantity can be understood as the maximum number of patches covered by grass , for instance , and acts as a limiting value ( together with the basal growth , to be defined ) for the number of animals that will inhabit the island .",
    "as time proceeds , and once we properly define the immigration mechanism , we will have a number @xmath40 of individuals in basal species present on the island and a number @xmath41 of individuals belonging to animal species .",
    "the total number of individuals in a wide sense ( say patches of grass plus animals ) is @xmath42 .",
    "each individual is characterized by an energy @xmath43 .",
    "individuals reproduce provided their value of @xmath43 is large enough .",
    "basal species increase their energy at a constant rate .",
    "animals dissipate energy as time elapses , and increase the value of @xmath43 through predation , which happens stochastically . at each time - step the following rules are implemented :    1",
    ".   * pair formation .",
    "* at each time step , we randomly form @xmath44 pairs of individuals , independently of their specific affiliation .",
    "if @xmath45 is odd , one individual remains without partner .",
    "this rule can be understood as a mean field picture of a space - explicit approach .",
    "different possibilities are i ) @xmath46 pair : the two grass patches are not consumed by animals and keep their energy , ii ) @xmath47 pair : if the matrix element @xmath48 is positive ( meaning that the individual @xmath49 feeds on @xmath50 ) , predation is possible , iii ) @xmath51 pair , allowing predation between different animal species depending on the matrix coefficients .",

    "no qualitative differences were observed for comparable sets of parameters .",
    "the initial quenched matrix @xmath21 can be thought of as the pool of species in the continent , where a very large area ( with its resources ) allows the coexistence of all possible species , in our case @xmath27 .",

    "if @xmath75 , one individual is introduced every @xmath74 time steps .",
    "other situations , which imply a less smooth flux are excluded in the following .",
    "our simulations show that the average number of species coexisting on the island depends very strongly on the vertical transmission of resources , as is well known to happen in real ecosystems ( rosenzweig , 1995 ) .",
    "high dissipation relatively to basal growth ( @xmath63 close to @xmath60 ) turns into few species on the island . for @xmath76 ( a factor of 2 or 3 may suffice ) the average number of species coexisting when @xmath12 is large enough approaches the maximum number @xmath71 .    with the addition of a constant flux of species from the continent to the island",
    ", the system is poised to a state of dynamical equilibrium , where the number of species that disappear due to the ecological interactions or to demographic stochasticity is balanced by the new incoming species .",
    "the immigration rate might produce a rescue effect for species with few individuals , close to extinction , and at the same time includes in a natural way one form of environmental stochasticity .",
    "thus , the incoming flux of individuals from the continent , the immigration rate , becomes our main variable . by changing its intensity",
    ", we can calculate the average number of species @xmath1 present in the statistically stable regime on an area @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , assuming a relation between the immigration rate @xmath12 and the area @xmath0 , we shall derive the species - area law resulting from the ecological dynamics of the ibm and compare it with field measurements .",
    "in this section we present the deterministic continuous models of population dynamics adopted in our simulations .",

    "species with biomass less than a predefined threshold value @xmath82 go extinct and are eliminated from the system .",
    "this mimics the effect of demographic stochasticity and the fact that species are made of discrete entities .",
    "the term @xmath83 stands for the dissipation of energy following from the biological activity of the members of species @xmath23 ( movement , extraction of nutrients , basal metabolism ) , as well as the death rate of individuals , and corresponds to the quantities @xmath63 and @xmath69 of the ibm .",
    "the term @xmath84 is known as self - damping .",
    "it expresses a negative feedback of @xmath85 on its own growth rate , which has been shown in some circumstances to be necessary in order to stabilize the model .",
    "the terms @xmath86 represent the biomass transfered per unit time from species @xmath25 to species @xmath23 if the sign is positive , and from species @xmath23 to species @xmath25 if it is negative , thus modelling prey - predator interactions .",
    "they are the counterpart of the matrix @xmath21 in the ibm .",

    "the quantity @xmath90 , equal to the energy transfer from prey species @xmath25 to predator species @xmath23 per unit of predator , is called the predator s functional response to prey @xmath25 .",

    "this means that new species are not related to species already on the island , that is , the continental pool is considered infinite respect to the number of species on the island .",

    "the dissipation parameters are the same for all species @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "colonizing species arrive with very small populations .",
    "this assures that they are rapidly eliminated if they are not fit for the island ecosystem .",
    "we used initial values @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "reducing the initial size reduces spurious effects due to species with very short permanence in the system , and has only a very small influence on the statistical patterns described later .      the choice that new species have preys but not predators on the island has to be justified .",
    "this rule is aimed at forbidding the formation of ecological loops . moreover",
    ", we want that newcomers have considerable chances of surviving , otherwise the rate of arrival of species with non vanishing permanence time would have large fluctuations , increasing the fluctuations of all ecological variables . with this rule ,",
    "the resulting ecological networks resemble very much those obtained with the application of the cascade algorithm , used in the ibm model .    our simulations considered several representations of the ecological dynamics at the individual and at the population level .",
    "although our consistent results let us believe that the models capture generic properties of ecological networks , there are a number of alternative ( and equally plausible ) dynamical rules or generalizations of our rules that would be interesting to consider .",
    "we shortly discuss some of them .",
    "this is of course a strong simplification . on the other hand , extracting at random for each species parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 would lead the average value of these parameters to decrease towards zero , due to the advantage conferred by small dissipation rates and self - damping . in order to avoid this effect , we believe that it is necessary to model a trade - off between dissipation , @xmath128 , and predation efficiency @xmath91 , in such a way that the latter is an increasing function of the former .",
    "another critical point is that all pairs of coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath130 have , in our model , opposite sign , so that symbiotic relationships are not represented .",
    "concerning the network structure , it is certainly a big simplification to build links independently one of each other . for a more realistic model one needs some measure of the distance among species in some multidimensional space .",
    "it would then be possible , for instance , to extract at random the first prey of a new species , and then to extract the remaining preys with a probability depending on the distance from the first prey .",
    "another simplification , in the framework of the continuous model , is that a new species has only preys and not predators .",
    "this was imposed in order to avoid the formation of ecological loops , and is very similar to the procedure adopted in the cascade model for network formation .",
    "it is thus conforting that ecological networks constructed both using the cascade model and random matrices containing loops ( in the ibm framework ) returned the same qualitative behaviour .",
    "for very long times , coevolution of species would become relevant .",
    "this might be taking into account by making appropriate modifications in the ecological network or in the interaction parameters .",
    "discarding coevolution is justified if the time scale of the simulation is much shorter than the time after which at least one species in the ecosystem mutates .",
    "nevertheless , the latter time scale is expected to decrease as the number of species in the ecosystem , @xmath114 , increases , until a point where it is not anymore possible to neglect coevolution .",
    "such a situation is worth considering and will be the subject of future work .",
    "for every set of observations , we shall present both results obtained with the continuous model and results obtained with the ibm , when available . in fact the two descriptions produce the same qualitative behavior , even if simulations are much faster for the continuous model , so that it is possible to simulate larger systems and to obtain better statistics .    when we extract at random an ecological network with a high number of species ( up to 1000 ) and a low number of links per species ( for instance four ) , the ecological dynamics leads to the extinction of most of the species , until only very few ones are represented in the system .",
    "this result does not seem to depend on the way in which the links have been extracted ( either using random matrices or through the cascade model ) , on the parameter values , or on the kind of ecological dynamics represented ( individual based or continuous , with constant @xmath91 or with ratio dependent response functions ) .",
    "in presence of a constant flux of immigrant species , the ecosystem , initially empty , increases very fast in diversity until it reaches a number of species which remains on the average stationary in time , although characterized by large fluctuations .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ] .",
    "the system differs significantly from a static network : in fact , if we stop immigrations we notice an abrupt decrease in the number of species until a fixed point of much lower diversity is reached ( see fig .  [",

    "choosing as time unity the quantity @xmath131 and as biomass unity the external resources @xmath89 , the dynamical equations can be written as a function of four dimensionless parameters . for model",

    "[ parab ] together with @xmath111 , the maximal number of preys for a colonizing species , these parameters determine the model ecosystem .",
    "we observe turnover of species in the system , and even a complete change in the species composition of the island in the course of time . in the ibm model , where we use a fixed continental pool of species ,",
    "the presence of different basal species determines the intermediate and top species allowed by the subnetwork on the island .",
    "due to stochastic effects , we observe an alternation between different basal species ( often after a long time interval ) , and consequently a complete renewal of the island ecosystem ( see fig .  [",

    "this picture agrees qualitatively with experiments on island repopulation ( simberloff & wilson , 1969 ; heatwole & levins , 1972 ; simberloff , 1969 ) , where , after defaunation , a different specific composition was obtained .",

    "indeed , if we assume that    ia^s , e_0a^- , we find sa^z , z = s+1+b . for the population models , we assumed @xmath206 ( the immigration rate is considered proportional to the linear size of the island ) , and we obtained @xmath207 ( in fact , the number of species increases as the logarithm of @xmath143 at fixed @xmath110 , both in the ibm and in the continuous model ( b ) ) .",
    "we remark that here , as in the explicit population models , we are assuming that the only source of immigrants is a continent far apart .",
    "the exponents that we find should then be compared to the exponents observed for isolated islands or archipelagos , while the exponent computed among islands of the same archipelago is expected to be lower , due to a reduced dependence of immigration rate on area .",
    "another point to remark is that the immigration rate @xmath12 measures the flux of new species arriving on the island .",
    "if this flux is assumed to originate from a ` continent ' of @xmath71 species , @xmath12 can be related to the total immigration flux @xmath159 by correcting for the immigrations already present on the island .",
    "the simplest ansatz is @xmath208 ( macarthur and wilson , 1963 , 1967 ) .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath159 , the average number of species @xmath1 reaches a saturation value of order @xmath71 .",
    "( the pool of immigrant species is indeed finite in our ibm , but infinite in the continuum models .",
    "hence , this correction becomes important in comparing results of the different models ) .",
    "we have presented a study of biodiversity in an insular ecosystem at the individual and the population level .",
    "our interest has been focused on the statistical properties of the dynamical stationary state and on the scaling relations between the system variables . instead of describing detailed situations",
    "in which some particular species and their exact interactions with their known preys and predators are included , we let ecological networks self - organize through random assemblage of species , ecological dynamics and possible extinctions .",
    "our main result is that , in a broad range of parameters , biodiversity scales approximately as a power law of the immigration rate .",
    "the value of the exponent varies slightly when the parameters of the models are changed , but the qualitative features of the stationary state are quite robust .",
    "the behavior of biodiversity with immigration rate allows to derive a species area relationship with a power law shape , if we assume that the immigration rate is proportional to the linear size of the island .",
    "such a model of immigration considers as unique source of diversity a flux of species from a continent far apart , thus it should be compared to observations relative to isolated islands or to whole archipelagos .",
    "the agreement is in this case rather good : the observed value of the effective exponent @xmath2 on archipelagos is @xmath188 ( adler , 1992 ; rosenzweig , 1995 ) , while we typically get , with the continuous model , values between @xmath209 and @xmath15 and , with the individual based model , values between @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "thus , the comparison of our two description levels points out to species - area law of the type ( [ saz ] ) as a generic feature of a broad set of ecological models with random interactions .",
    "our models reproduce qualitatively other features observed in real ecosystems .",
    "we observe a power law distribution of population abundances , _",
    "i.e. _ the number @xmath191 of species with @xmath190 individuals approximately decreases as @xmath212 .",
    "this is expected to be a general consequence of the multiplicative nature of population dynamics equations .",
    "the exponent @xmath195 found in our simulations is close to unity , in favourable comparison with field data , and increases with the immigration rate .",
    "we also observe a broad distribution of the time of permanence of species in the system @xmath213 , as it has been observed in the field ( keitt & marquet , 1996 ; keitt & stanley , 1998 ) and in a related model ( sol _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the average permanence time is proportional to the number of species and inversely proportional to the immigration rate , @xmath214 , so that it decreases with the immigration rate .",
    "the fact that it is observed , both in field studies and in models , that its distribution is broad , could help to reconcile the apparent dichotomy between fugitive species and permanent species : these groups of species could correspond to the two extreme cases of a unique distribution of permanence times ( schoener & spiller , 1987 ) . the approximate power law shape of the distribution of times of permanence in the island is reminiscent of the analogous distribution of the lifetime of genera in the fossil record , which is approximately given by @xmath215 , with @xmath216 , close to what is observed in our model for very small immigration rates and also close to ecological observations .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this similarity points out at similar mechanisms acting on the time scales of ecosystem dynamics as on the timescales of macroevolution .",
    "the number of trophic levels in the food web is also strongly influenced by the immigration rate .",
    "we typically find from four to ten trophic levels , depending on parameters , and with a tendency for the number of levels to increase with immigration rate .",
    "hints to the correlation between immigration rate and number of levels can be found in the fact that the length of food chains appears to be positively correlated to habitat area , although the data are quite poor ( schoener , 1989 ; spencer , 1997 ) .",
    "our results suggest that one of the factors limiting the length of food chains is the immigration or speciation rate .",
    "notice that in our model no other limitations to the length of food chains exist : energetic considerations would limit the number of levels to a value @xmath217 , much larger than the one observed .",
    "an important result of our study is that the observed statistical patterns are rather robust with respect to changes in the dynamical rules of the model .",
    "one example is the representation of space in the ibm model . although one could think that in this case explicit space is needed , we modelled space only in an effective way , increasing the immigration rate and the resources with the area .",
    "we believe that this effective approach captures the main features of the behavior of biodiversity with area , even if important issues , like for instance the presence of many different habitats , are not represented in the model .    as pimm poses it , _ ( ... ) it is pointless to try to justify models equations biologically  their assumptions are almost bound to be wrong .",
    "( ... ) the concern should not be whether the assumptions are wrong ( they are ! ) , but whether it matters that they are wrong . _ ( pimm , 1991 ) .",
    "it seems that the statistical laws and the scaling relationships that we observed are generic properties of complex ecosystems , that is an unavoidable results of a minimal set of rules governing population dynamics and immigrations . thus the strategy is to look for the simplest set of rules which appear sensible and which allow to derive the observed statistical patterns of biodiversity .",
    "discussions with david alonso , lloyd demetrius , barbara drossel , lorenz fahse and martin rost are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in the case of model ( a ) of continuous dynamics , we observed that only basal species could survive on the long run for parameter values in a certain range . in this case , observing the system on a very long time scale , we did not see any stationary state ( although a stationary state was reached for a much smaller system ) , but we saw a number of species steadily and slowly increasing in time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : garden ] ) .",
    "we call such a regime the _ garden regime _ , since predators are absent .",
    "its statistical properties are peculiar : the distribution of biomasses is narrow and peaked at very low values , and the distribution of lifetimes is bimodal , with a high peak for very short lifetimes corresponding to non - basal species , and a shorter one for large lifetimes , corresponding to basal species .",
    "( even if at any moment there are many more basal species than predators , the number of predators passing through the system and almost immediately going extinct is much larger than the corresponding number of basal species . ) finally , the distribution of the transfer rate @xmath218 from the external resources to species @xmath23 is strongly peaked close to the maximum allowed value @xmath151 .",
    "all these features can be easily rationalized as follows .",
    "let us consider a situation where @xmath1 basal species coexist feeding on the abiotic resources @xmath87 .",
    "our calculations ( unpublished ) show that at the static fixed point of the corresponding ecological equations , eqs .",
    "( [ equ ] ) and ( [ res2 ] ) , all biomasses are positive if and only if all differences in the coefficients @xmath218 are smaller than @xmath219 , where @xmath220 . thus , as @xmath1 increases ,",
    "the coupling constants between the basal species and the environment deviate from the initial distribution and become more and more similar . notice that , if @xmath221 , the coefficients @xmath218 s should be exactly equal to guarantee coexistence ( this expresses in this context the `` principle of competitive exclusion '' ) .",
    "this conclusion does not vary qualitatively if one considers eq .",
    "( [ denom ] ) instead of the model with constant coefficients @xmath91 .",
    "thus , in a system without predators and high immigration of basal species , we would expect to find many basal species with very similar biomasses , all of order @xmath222 ( @xmath1 should be smaller than @xmath143 ) and coefficients @xmath218 very close one to each other in value .      r_=__--n_c . since @xmath222 is larger than @xmath82",
    ", we find that , for large @xmath1 , a non - basal species can colonize only if _",

    "( [ denom ] ) , @xmath223 equals @xmath224 .",
