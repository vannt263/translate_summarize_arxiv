    "on studying the vast amount of literature @xcite dealing with the phenomena observed in @xmath3-wave meson - meson scattering , one may wonder whether the question _  what is a resonance ? \" _ has any answer at all .",
    "different theoretical considerations even come to opposite conclusions @xcite for the same phenomenon . _",
    "_    one reason for the difficulty to unambiguously explain meson - meson - scattering phenomena , may stem from the following . in atomic physics ,",
    "the perturbative approach towards electromagnetic ( em ) transitions is justified , since the em binding forces are apparently more decisive for the energy - level splittings than photon radiation .",
    "we may thus predict the radiation frequencies for atomic transitions to a good accuracy , by just determining the atomic levels of the binding forces .",
    "atomic states have lifetimes which are large as compared with the internal em frequencies .",
    "hence , electrons complete many revolutions about the nucleus before the system decays .",
    "such systems can be considered stable , like planetary ones .",
    "we may , therefore , determine the masses of excited atoms , without making a drastic approximation , just from the em bound - state spectrum , which procedure is only correct for stable systems .",
    "the wave functions for very unstable systems have to be determined by different methods .",
    "most probably , they can be expressed as linear combinations of the bound - state solutions , in which case not just one , but all excitations contribute to the transition amplitude .    in table",
    "[ stability ] we express the stability of quark - antiquark systems by estimating the number of complete cycles of the system before decay . for the internal frequency of @xmath11 systems , we take the universal frequency @xmath12 of the nijmegen model ( see table  [ parameters ] ) .",
    ".the ratios of internal frequency and width , @xmath12/@xmath13 , for some stable and less stable mesons .",
    "[ stability ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "on applying the flavour - independence relations ( [ flavorinvariance ] ) also to @xmath3-wave @xmath14 scattering , we obtained an interesting result , which we shall report here .    in our initial analysis @xcite",
    ", we identified the @xmath4 meson with the lowest - lying extra pole , which stems from the background , whereas the higher resonance at about 2.9 gev , with a width of some 150 mev , was linked to the confinement ground state .",
    "however , if we choose for the delta - shell radius @xmath15 its corrected flavour - independent value , then we find that the roles of these two poles get interchanged .",
    "this phenomenon is depicted in fig .",
    "[ crossing ] , where , upon a very small variation in @xmath15 , the pole trajectories interchange their physically relevant limiting points , which nevertheless change only very little themselves .    as a consequence",
    ", we must conclude that the `` identity '' of a pole can not always be inferred with certainty . while in the small - coupling situation ( see e.g.  the @xmath16 case in fig .",
    "[ crkpi ] ) it is unquestionable which poles are to be associated with the confinement spectrum , for intermediate and large couplings one can always find other parameters in eq .",
    "( [ partialpshift ] ) that , when varied simultaneously with the coupling , lead to an identity change .",
    "since intermediate - size couplings are typical for strong hadronic decay , one must conclude that such processes are inherently nonperturbative , and thus must be treated accordingly .",
    "we should mention , moreover , that the flavour - independence relation  ( [ flavorinvariance ] ) mildly alters our previous results .",
    "the @xmath4 pole now comes out at 2.32 gev ( actually very close to the experimental mass ) , instead of at the published @xcite value of 2.28 gev .",
    "furthermore , we find that the higher resonance shifts even more considerably . here",
    "we obtain a width of some 400 mev instead of 150 mev , and a central mass around 2.8 gev , roughly 100 mev below the initially proposed value .",
    "the main issue of this paper is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ import ] , where we show how the various sectors of meson physics contribute to resonances in meson - meson scattering .",
    "glue is probably dominant for the dynamics of meson - meson scattering .",
    "it provides confinement , contributes dominantly to the effective masses of the light quarks , and is also involved , though in a complicated and not entirely understood fashion , in the creation of quark - antiquark pairs with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the degrees of freedom of mesons are given by their @xmath11 content .",
    "higher - order configurations of @xmath11 pairs mediate the transitions of a mesonic state to multi - meson states .",
    "figure  [ import ] also indicates schematically the origin of deformation of the confinement sector by the multi - meson sector , which results in mass shifts , resonance widths , extra resonances , and bound states .",
    "for all that , processes involving the creation of one or more @xmath11 pairs are generally strong , and should _ not _ be handled perturbatively . _ _        we wish to thank the organisers of the workshop , in particular ldia ferreira , for the warm hospitality .",
    "we are also indebted to david bugg and frieder kleefeld for very useful discussions .",
