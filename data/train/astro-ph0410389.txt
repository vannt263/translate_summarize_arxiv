    "the idea of passing starlight through an absorption medium to superimpose a set of reference lines and subsequently precisely measure radial velocities was first proposed by @xcite . at that time",
    ", @xcite used the atmosphere and the telluric h@xmath4o and o@xmath4 lines . in order to overcome systematic errors in velocities caused by , among others , the atmospheric pressure changes and hence shifts in the position of the telluric lines",
    ", @xcite introduced for the first time an absorption cell ( containing a toxic hydrogen fluoride gas ) .",
    "this technique was subsequently used to carry out a pioneering precision radial velocity survey of 16 stars over the period of six years ( 1981 - 1987 ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is conceivable that @xcite would have detected the first extrasolar planet if they targeted a larger number of stars as their average velocity precision was @xmath113  ms@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite took the absorption cell technique to a new level by introducing an iodine ( i@xmath4 ) absorption cell with the modeling of a spectrograph point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the gaseous iodine , besides being much less toxic , has a strong line absorption coefficient ( and hence requires a path length of only a few centimeters ) and offers a dense forest of absorption lines over the wavelength range of 500 - 630 nm . in their approach ,",
    "the doppler shift of a star spectrum @xmath5 is determined by solving the following equation @xcite @xmath6 \\,\\otimes\\,psf\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the shift of the star spectrum , @xmath8 is the shift of the iodine transmission function @xmath9 , @xmath10 represents a convolution and @xmath11 a spectrograph psf .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 as well as parameters describing the psf are determined by performing a least - squares fit to the observed ( through the iodine cell ) spectrum @xmath13 . to this end",
    ", one also needs a high snr star spectrum taken without the cell @xmath14 which serves as a template for all the spectra observed through the cell and the i@xmath0 transmission function @xmath9 obtained with the fourier transform spectrometer at the kitt peak national observatory . the doppler shift of a star spectrum is then given by @xmath15 .",
    "to date , the iodine technique has been successfully used to detect @xmath180 out of @xmath1130 known extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "most of these detections were accomplished by the california - carnegie group @xcite .",
    "the iodine technique  thanks to its conceptual simplicity  is the most commonly adopted way to obtain precision radial velocities .",
    "iodine absorption cells are available on many spectrographs  hires at the 10 m keck i ( keck observatory ) , hamilton at the 3 m shane ( lick observatory ) , ucles at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( anglo - australian observatory ) , hrs at the 9 m het ( mcdonald observatory ) , mike at the 6.5 m magellan ( las campanas observatory ) , uves at the 8 m kueyen ( cerro paranal ) , hds at the 8.2 m subaru ( national astronomical observatory of japan ) and many others  and are used for planet detections .",
    "unfortunately , in its classical version the iodine technique can only be applied to single stars or spectroscopic binaries whose secondaries are so faint that their spectral lines are undetectable .",
    "this is dictated by the need to supply an observed template spectrum of each binary component for eq .  , but in the case of double - lined spectroscopic binaries it can not be accomplished since their spectra are obviously always composite and time variable .    in this paper , we present a novel technique which employs an i@xmath0 absorption cell to obtain precision radial velocities of both components of double - lined spectroscopic binaries . the technique and its tests are described in section 2 and its applications to stellar astronomy and searches for planets in binary and multiple stellar systems are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we can measure precise radial velocities of both components of a spectroscopic binary with an i@xmath0 absorption cell in the following way .",
    "first , we always take two subsequent exposures of each ( binary ) target  one with and the other without the i@xmath0 cell .",
    "this is contrary to the standard approach for single stars where an exposure without the cell ( a template ) is taken only once .",
    "this way we obtain an instantaneous template which is used to model only the adjacent exposure taken with the cell .",
    "next , we perform the usual least - squares fit and obtain the parameters described in eq .  .",
    "obviously , the derived doppler shift , @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 denotes the epoch of the observation ) , carries no meaning since each time a different template is used ( besides it describes a doppler  shift \" of a composite spectrum that is typically different at each epoch ) .",
    "however , the parameters ( in particular the wavelength solution and the parameters describing psf ) are accurately determined and can be used to extract the star spectrum , @xmath18 , for each epoch @xmath17 , by inverting the equation   @xmath19 /t_{i_{2}}(\\lambda)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes deconvolution ( carried out using a modified jansson technique ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath21 , symbolically , the set of parameters describing psf at the epoch @xmath17 .",
    "such a star spectrum has an accurate wavelength solution , is free of the i@xmath0 lines and the influence of a varying psf . in the final step",
    ", the velocities of both components of a binary target can be measured with the well known two - dimensional cross - correlation technique todcor @xcite using as templates the synthetic spectra derived with the atlas  9 and atlas  12 programs @xcite and matched to the observed spectrum , @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "the formal errors of the velocities can be derived from the scatter between the velocities from different echelle orders or using the formalism of todcor @xcite .",
    "the above approach will produce radial velocities that may suffer from two possible sources of systematic errors .",
    "( 1 ) the numerical procedure of extracting a star spectrum from an exposure taken with the i@xmath0 cell could imaginably introduce systematic errors .",
    "( 2 ) todcor itself could also produce systematic errors .",
    "it has never been tested at a high velocity precision ( let us say , @xmath110  ms@xmath2 ) and the use of synthetic spectra could be a source of systematic errors .    in order to demonstrate our method and investigate the systematic errors , we have observed a number of targets with hires spectrograph at the keck i telescope .",
    "hires equipped with an i@xmath0 absorption cell has been successfully used to detect many extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "we have observed hd  209458 ( a single star with a known short period extrasolar planet , v=7.6 mag ) , hd  109358 ( a velocity standard , v=4.3 mag ) , hd  4676 and hd  282975 ( double - lined spectroscopic binaries in pleiades , v=5.0 and 10.0 mag , respectively ) and hd  206901 ( a triple system , v=4.2 mag ) .",
    "the data span is approximately two years for hd  209458 ( from mid 2002 to mid 2004 ) , one year for hd  4676 , hd  282975 and hd  206901 ( from mid 2003 to mid 2004 ) and @xmath110 minutes for hd  109358 ( on 29 mar 2004 ) . with the exception of hd  209458",
    "whose spectra had a typical snr of 40 - 80 ( hd  209458 was initially used as a standard star for a separate transiting planet search and was observed with moderate exposure times ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the snr of all other spectra was typically in the range of 150 - 300 .",
    "since in our approach we do not assume that an observed object must have a composite spectrum , the method can be applied to single stars as well .",
    "obviously , there is no need to analyze the spectra of single stars in such a way but the velocities computed in both ways ( eqs 1 and 2 ) can be compared and used to explore possible additional errors originating in the proposed procedure .",
    "two such comparisons are presented in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the first figure shows 6 velocity measurements of hd  109358 over the period of about 10 minutes .",
    "hd  109358 is a high - precision radial velocity standard proposed by the geneva group @xcite .",
    "clearly , the two velocity sets have very similar scatter and no additional errors at the 3 ms@xmath2 can be seen . the second test ( fig .",
    "2 ) concerns hd  209458 ( the data span is two years ) , a well known star harboring a transiting giant planet with the orbital period of 3.52 days .",
    "its orbital parameters are very accurately known @xcite and hence were fixed in this test .",
    "the only parameter for which we fit was a velocity offset .",
    "the test does not reveal any additional errors either .",
    "in fact , the velocities computed using a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) have a smaller rms ( 10 vs 14 ms@xmath2 ) than the velocities computed with the traditional iodine approach  most likely due to a mediocre snr of the spectra of hd  209458 ( the iodine technique with psf modeling works best on high snr spectra ) .",
    "in order to test our method on a truly binary spectrum we have observed hd  4676 ( 64 psc )  a nearby ( 23 pc ) binary star composed of two f8 dwarfs .",
    "hd  4676ab has the orbital period of 13.8 days and the brightness ratio of @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite were the first to determine its spectroscopic orbit which was later improved by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , its astrometric orbit is known from the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has important consequences for our work as such astrometric data can be used to verify our precision radial velocities  orbital models for astrometric and spectroscopic measurements share most of the orbital parameters and can be used together to perform a combined least - squares fit ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have observed hd  4676 over the period of one year on five occasions ( 11 aug 2003 , 12 aug 2003 , 17 nov 2003 , 18 nov 2003 and 18 jul 2004 ) and obtained 24 radial velocity ( rv ) measurements for each component .",
    "the average formal rv error is 25 ms@xmath2 for the primary and 28 ms@xmath2 for the secondary .",
    "the quality of the data was verified by performing a combined fit to our rvs and the astrometric data published by @xcite .",
    "the details of the fit are presented in figure  3 .",
    "the post - fit rms of 24 ms@xmath2 is in a very reasonable agreement with the formal rv errors and is 27 times smaller than the rms reported by @xcite .",
    "it obviously results in a much better determination of the orbital and physical parameters of the system .",
    "we discuss it in detail in section 3.1 .",
    "the most important remaining issue is whether todcor and the use of synthetic spectra could introduce any systematic errors to rvs .",
    "while errors that simply increase the post - fit rms are not particularly troubling , one can in principle expect errors that may depend on the orbital phase and possibly affect the best - fit values of the orbital parameters . a common sense way to detect such errors",
    "is to apply our method to simulated spectra of hd  4676 and try to recover the rvs assumed in the simulation . we have performed such tests and have not detected any systematic errors .",
    "there is however an even better way to control these errors .",
    "as already mentioned , thanks to a high precision astrometry of hd  4676 from pti @xcite , one can perform a combined fit to the astrometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "if there existed any significant phase - dependent systematic variations of the velocities , they would be detectable in the post - fit residuals from the combined solution .",
    "clearly , these are absent in our solution ( fig .  3 ) and @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "it should be noted that the best - fit rms of 24 ms@xmath2 for the rvs of the primary and secondary is clearly larger than one would expect if the rv errors were photon - limited ( 2 - 3 ms@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible sources of additional errors include : a mismatch between the synthetic templates and observed spectra and astrophysical phenomena ( e.g. starspots , convective inhomogeneities , see * ? ? ?",
    "we do not have yet enough data for other binaries to fully address this issue .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect that for later type stars ( with more spectral lines ) , the velocity precision will be higher .",
    "this appears to be confirmed by our velocities of hd  282975 , a double - lined spectroscopic binary from pleiades ( @xmath26 ) , which is composed of two g6 dwarfs .",
    "the post - fit rms is 11 ms@xmath2 for the primary and 13 ms@xmath2 for the secondary and is @xmath27 times smaller than the rms reported by @xcite .",
    "the best fit is based on only 8 rvs but from our experience with hd  4676 we know that early accuracy is later confirmed by a larger data set .    finally , let us note that the iodine technique for single stars typically produces rvs which have an arbitrary offset ( unless special steps are undertaken , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our approach which employs synthetic spectra one can in principle calibrate and",
    "refer the velocities to a standard system of stars .",
    "we plan to do it once we collect enough observations of the rv standards .",
    "modern tests of stellar structure and evolution models require stellar masses accurate to @xmath28 or better @xcite .",
    "stellar masses are traditionally derived from the observations of binary stars by combining ( 1 ) photometric ( light curves ) and spectroscopic data ( rvs ) for double - lined eclipsing binaries , ( 2 ) relative astrometry and spectroscopic data for double - lined binaries , ( 3 ) from spectroscopy , relative astrometry and parallax for single - lined binaries and ( 4 ) absolute astrometry .",
    "there are currently known about @xmath29 binaries with masses of the components accurate at the level of @xmath28 or better ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "almost all of them are eclipsing binaries and most of them have components with the masses in the 1 - 3 m@xmath30 range ( more massive and hence larger stars are more likely to be eclipsing , for a given orbital period )",
    ".    optical interferometry offers the unique opportunity to determine visual orbits of double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( apparent semi - major axes at the milliarcsecond level ; for a recent discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and subsequently masses of the components , regardless of their size . up to date , about twenty spectroscopic binaries have had their orbits determined with optical interferometers @xcite . in a few cases , when combined with radial velocity measurements , they already produced component masses accurate at the level of 1 - 2@xmath3 .",
    "our rvs constitute an excellent complement to precise astrometric orbits from optical interferometers .",
    "this is demonstrated well by hd  4676 .",
    "@xcite combined their interferometric data of hd  4676 from pti with the radial velocity measurements of @xcite .",
    "they have determined the masses to be @xmath31m@xmath30 ( 1.7@xmath3 ) , @xmath32m@xmath30 ( 1.5@xmath3 ) , the velocity amplitudes @xmath33 kms@xmath2 , @xmath34 kms@xmath2 and the inclination , @xmath35 deg . the relative error in the masses ( @xmath36 )",
    "is dominated by the error in the orbital inclination , @xmath37 , but the errors in the velocity amplitudes also contribute . in order to make the best out of pti data",
    ", we used our rvs and performed a new combined fit .",
    "the best - fit orbital and physical parameters of the system are presented in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the relative error in the masses is now @xmath38 and the overall quality of the fit has improved . in this specific case",
    ", the ultimate accuracy of the masses is still limited by the accuracy of the orbital inclination . however , since the radial velocities are so precise , one can simply take more astrometric data with pti and improve the masses even more .",
    "clearly , our approach will be of great use for all those binaries that have orbital inclinations closer to an edge - on configuration .",
    "in particular , light curves of eclipsing binaries combined with precise rvs should produce masses accurate at the @xmath39 level on a regular basis .",
    "precise rvs can obviously be used not only to determine the masses of the companions but the distance to the binary as well .",
    "for example , the parallax of hd4676 is formally very accurate , @xmath40 mas ( the distance of @xmath41  pc ; the final accuracy will depend on how well the brightness ratio of the binary components is known ) . in this context ,",
    "hd  282975 ( fig .",
    "4 ) appears as a particularly interesting binary as it can be used to derive a very precise distance to pleiades . to this end",
    ", one needs interferometric - astrometry of hd  282975 which should be easy to obtain with the keck interferometer ( hd  282975 is too faint for pti ) .",
    "finally , precise rvs can be used to explore the regime of circular or almost circular orbits ( the error of the eccentricity of hd  4676 is only @xmath42 , tab .  1 ) and the cut - off period below which orbits are circularized",
    ".      @xcite have demonstrated that the frequency of binaries ( bf ) among field stars older than 1 gyr is 57% .",
    "the studies of multiplicity of pre main - sequence stars ( pms ) in the taurus and ophiuchus star forming regions show that bf for systems in the separation range 1 to 150 au is twice as large as that of the older field stars @xcite .",
    "further investigations have concluded that bf is lower for young stellar clusters ( and similar to bf of the field stars ) and that the binary frequency for pms seems to be anti - correlated with the stellar density @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , bf is very high for both field and pre main - sequence stars and one can argue that it may not be possible to assess the overall frequency and properties of extrasolar planets without addressing binary ( and multiple ) stellar systems .",
    "supporting arguments come from the presence of circumstellar and circumbinary disks around binaries .",
    "one of the prime examples of the circumstellar disks in a binary system is the case of l1551  irs  5 .",
    "@xcite show that l1551  irs  5 is a binary pms with the separation of 45 au in which each component is surrounded by a disk .",
    "the radii of the disks are 10 au and the estimated masses are 0.06 and 0.03 @xmath43 , supposedly enough to produce planets .",
    "recently , @xcite have spatially resolved mid - infrared scattered light from the protoplanetary disk around the secondary of the pms binary hk tau ab .",
    "the inferred sizes of the dust grains are in the range 1.5 - 3 @xmath44 m which suggests that the first step in the planet formation , the dust grain growth , has occurred in this disk .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter measurements of the dust continuum emission enable us to measure the total masses of disks .",
    "these observations show that the circumbinary disks may be reduced in size and mass but still are present even in close systems .",
    "the circumbinary disks are observed at millimeter wavelengths around many pms spectroscopic binaries .",
    "such massive disks are however rare around wide binaries with separations of 1 - 100 au .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical works that predict circumstellar and circumbinary disks truncated by the companions @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar disks have the outer radii 0.2 - 0.5 times the binary separation while the circumbinary disks have the inner radii 2 - 3 times the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "finally , the measurements of the infrared excess emission show no difference in frequency of the excess among binaries and single stars .",
    "it indicates that the circumstellar material in binary systems may be similar in temperature and surface density to that in the disks surrounding single stars @xcite .",
    "the problem of stability of the planetary orbits in binaries was recognized a long time ago .",
    "it was mostly approached with the numerical studies of the elliptic restricted three - body problem .",
    "the orbital configurations considered include the so - called p - type ( planet - type , circumbinary orbits ) , s - type ( satellite - type , circumprimary or circumsecondary orbits ) and l - type orbits ( librator - type , orbits around stable lagrangian points l4 or l5 for the mass ratios @xmath45 ) .",
    "there are many papers concerning the stability of s - type motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they aimed at developing empirical stability criteria in the framework of the circular three - body problem ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the stability of periodic orbits and the stability of the test particles in binary systems as a function of the eccentricity of the binary .",
    "the p - type motions were also investigated @xcite ; as were the l - type orbits ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of the analytical papers deal only with circular binary orbits , numerical studies are confined to special mass ratios and the integration times used are relatively short .",
    "also , they are almost exclusively restricted to the framework of the three body problem .",
    "some of these issues are addressed by @xcite who studied a range of mass ratios , eccentricities and used long integration times ( at least @xmath46 periods of the binary ) .",
    "nonetheless , we can safely conclude that planets in binary stellar systems , once formed , would enjoy a wide range of stable orbits .",
    "however , the theories of planet formation in binary stellar systems are still at early stages . @xcite studied terrestrial planet growth in the circumprimary habitable zones in a binary system .",
    "they considered a 4-body system of 2 stars and 2 planetesimals for which by varying the orbital parameters of the binary ( the semi - major axis , eccentricity and mass ratio ) they were able to determine a critical semi - major axis of the binary below which the secondary does not allow a growth of the planetesimals ( planetesimals are accelerated by the secondary , their relative velocity is larger than critical and their collisions become destructive ) . based on this criterion , they concluded that about 60% of nearby solar - type binaries can not be excluded from having a habitable planet .",
    "@xcite analyzed @xmath47  cen  ab ( the semi - major axis of 23 au , eccentricity of 0.52 , mass ratio 1.1/0.92 ) , a prototype close binary system , and demonstrated that the planetesimals can accrete into planetary embryos .",
    "@xcite continued the study and showed that planetary embryos can grow into terrestrial planets in about 50 myr . somewhat contrary to this result",
    ", @xcite , who analyzed a binary system similar to l1551  irs  5 , found that the planet formation is unlikely in equal mass binary systems with the separation of about 50 au .",
    "yet another result by @xcite claims that a stellar companion can induce a multi - jupiter - mass planet formation .",
    "clearly , there is a lack of consensus and the planet formation theories would certainly benefit from observational constraints .    unfortunately , current rv searches for extrasolar planets have been limited to single stars or binaries with large apparent separations . despite that prejudice out of @xmath1130 extrasolar planets ,",
    "eighteen belong to stars which have also stellar companions @xcite .",
    "they even seem to posses characteristics different from those orbiting single stars .",
    "as recently pointed out by @xcite , ( 1 ) the most massive short period planets orbit stars from multiple stellar systems and ( 2 ) all these planets ( @xmath48 days ) tend to have very low eccentricities .",
    "it is a surprisingly interesting result given that current rv surveys suffer from a selection effect  the binary stars with separations smaller than @xmath12 arcsec have been excluded from the surveys .",
    "the exception here is hd  41004ab which has a separation of 0.5 arcsec . presumably , this star entered the geneva rv program as a single star and was later found to be a triple ( sic ! ) system in which the primary has apparently a giant planet @xcite and the secondary and tertiary are very faint ( an m star and a putative brown dwarf ) . thus these stars from binary or multiple stellar systems which we know that harbor planets have a distant or / and a faint stellar companion .",
    "there is a need to perform an unbiased survey for extrasolar planets and substellar companions to stars from multiple systems which will probe different physical separations and brightness ratios .    to this end ,",
    "two years ago we have initiated a survey to detect planets in binary stellar systems with the keck  i and het telescopes .",
    "our survey covers about @xmath1450 binary stars from the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "preliminary results for one of our representative targets , @xmath49  peg are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath49  peg ( hr  8315 , hd  206901 , hip  107354 ) is a known triple system of which the spectral lines of the two brightest components ab ( apparent semi - major axis 0.4 arcsec ) can be easily identified ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) and the component b is itself a single - lined spectroscopic binary with the orbital period of @xmath15.97 days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the radial velocities of the primary do not reveal any interesting variations and are of inferior quality due to a large @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rvs of the sharp - lined secondary are more than acceptable ( given an early spectral type of the star , f3iv ) with the rms of @xmath53 .",
    "it is an improvement of 30 times in the rms compared to the work of @xcite and demonstrates the usefulness of our approach . since the iodine cells are available on many high - resolution spectrographs , our method clearly opens exciting opportunities in the studies of other multiple systems .",
    "we have introduced a new method to measure precision radial velocities of double - lined spectroscopic binaries with an iodine absorption cell .",
    "our initial data sets demonstrate 20 - 30 ms@xmath2 velocity precision for  early \" ( f3-f8 ) type and @xmath110  ms@xmath2 for later type binaries .",
    "if combined with interferometric astrometry , such velocities enable us to determine the masses of the components of binary stars accurate at least at the level of @xmath54 .",
    "our method also makes it possible to perform a search for extrasolar planets in binary and multiple stellar systems where the brightness of the primary and the secondary is comparable .",

    "<S> we discuss applications of the technique to stellar astronomy and searches for extrasolar planets in binary systems . in particular , we combine the interferometric data collected with the palomar testbed interferometer with our preliminary precision velocities of the spectroscopic double - lined binary hd  4676 to demonstrate that with such a combination one can routinely obtain masses of the binary components accurate at least at the level of 1.0@xmath3 . </S>"
