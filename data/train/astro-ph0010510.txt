    "young supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the prime accelerators of cosmic rays , at least up to the `` knee '' of the cosmic ray spectrum at energies of @xmath2  tev , beyond which the spectrum steepens . however , the direct evidence for particle acceleration to such energies is scarce .",
    "radio emission from shell - type snrs is the result of synchrotron radiation from shock accelerated electrons , but these electrons have typical energies of order 10  gev .",
    "it is only the recent discoveries of nonthermal x - ray emission from shell - type snrs that have finally provided evidence of particles at energies of 10100  tev .",
    "the x - ray emission from sn  1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) and g347.3@xmath00.5 ( koyama et al . 1997 , slane et al . 1999 ) is _ predominantly _ nonthermal , while that from cas  a , kepler , tycho , and rcw 86 ( allen , gotthelf , & petre 1999 ) is predominantly thermal , but contains a nonthermal component as well .",
    "however , it may also be the x - ray emission that poses the most significant constraint on accepting snrs as the source of cosmic rays at energies near the knee .",
    "the x - ray fluxes from all remnants fall below the extrapolation of their radio spectra , implying a steepening or cut - off of the electron spectrum at higher energies .",
    "the implied spectral cut - off energies appear to be well below the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum ( reynolds & keohane 1999 ) .",
    "it is thus of considerable importance to identify new examples of shell - type snrs for which the x - ray emission is largely nonthermal .",
    "rx  j0852.0 - 0462 was discovered by aschenbach ( 1998 ) using data from the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "situated along the line of sight to the vela snr , the emission stands out above the soft thermal emission from vela only at energies above @xmath3  kev .",
    "data from the rosat pspc indicates a hard spectrum with either a hot thermal component with @xmath4  kev or a power law component with photon index @xmath5 ( aschenbach 1998 ) .",
    "the remnant is circular with a diameter of @xmath6 ; the emission is particularly enhanced along the northern , western , and southeastern limbs .",
    "hereafter , we use the designation g266.2@xmath01.2  for this newly identified snr .    as first noted by aschenbach ( 1998 )",
    "the radio emission from g266.2@xmath01.2  is quite weak ( @xmath7 jy at 1 ghz ) with faint , limb - brightened emission similar to the x - ray morphology ( combi , romero , & benaglia 1999 ; duncan & green 2000 ) .",
    "sn1006 and g347 are also faint radio emitters , perhaps suggesting a general characteristic of remnants for which the x - ray flux is dominated by nonthermal processes .",
    "iyudin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported the comptel detection of @xmath1ti from the source gro  j0852 - 4642 , which was tentatively associated with g266.2@xmath01.2 .",
    "if correct , this association would be profound ; the very short @xmath1ti lifetime ( @xmath8  y ) would imply a very young snr , and the large observed size would require that the remnant be very nearby as well .",
    "estimates based on the x - ray diameter and @xmath9-ray flux of @xmath1ti indicate an age of @xmath10  y and a distance of @xmath11  pc ( aschenbach , iyudin , & schnfelder 1999 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum would seem to support this scenario as well .",
    "the inferred temperature would imply a rapid shock that is consistent with a young snr .",
    "however , as we show here , the hard x - ray emission is not from hot , shock - heated gas ; it is nonthermal .",
    "further , separate reanalysis of the comptel data finds that the detection of g266.2@xmath01.2  as a @xmath1ti source is only significant at the @xmath12 confidence level ( schnfelder et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the absence of such emission , and given that the x - ray emission is nonthermal , the nearby distance and young age may need to be reexamined .",

    "the image consists of a mosaic of 7 individual fields .",
    "contours represent the outline of the vela snr as seen in rosat survey data with the pspc .",
    "we have carried out x - ray observations of g266.2@xmath01.2  with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( asca ) .",
    "the remnant was mapped in 7 distinct pointings , each of @xmath14  ks duration . the resulting image from the asca gis detectors",
    "is illustrated in figure 1 ( see also tsunemi et al .",
    "bright emission along the northern and western shell is accompanied by a compact central source surrounded by diffuse emission .",
    "additional enhanced emission along the southeast shell is seen in the rosat image ( aschenbach 1998 ) but was inadvertently missed in the mapping carried out here .",
    "contours in figure 1 correspond to soft emission ( @xmath15  kev ) from the vela snr , as observed in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "standard screening processes were applied to data from both the gis and sis detectors , and spectra were extracted from distinct regions of the remnant .",
    "regions outside the snr shell in the northwestern pointing were used for background subtraction for the gis and for sis chips s0c1,2 and s1c0,3 . for the other sis chips , for which no local background was available , we extracted background spectra from the blank sky fields available from the asca guest observer facility .",
    "although these fields are at high galactic latitude , and are thus not representative of our viewing direction ( particularly given the contribution from vela itself ) , we find that results from spectral fitting are quite similar with either background source .    in figure 2 we present plots of the x - ray spectra from three regions along the rim of the remnant using the gis detectors : 1 ) the bright northwest rim ; 2 ) the northeast rim ; and 3 ) the western rim .",
    "spectra were extracted from circular regions with radius @xmath16  arcmin centered on the location of maximum brightness . unlike the line - dominated thermal emission that one expects from a young remnant , the spectra are featureless and well described by a power law of index @xmath17 .",
    "this is remarkably similar to that observed for g347.3@xmath00.5 ( koyama et al .",
    "1997 , slane et al .",
    "1999 ) , another shell - type snr dominated by nonthermal emission .",
    "the index is flatter than that observed for sn  1006 ( @xmath18 ) , the prototype of this class of nonthermal shell - type snrs ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) , although this value was derived for only a portion of the remnant shell .",
    "due to the smaller field of view and the difficulty of merging spectra from different ccds , the spectra from the sis are somewhat sparse .",
    "however , there is still a clear lack of emission line features .",
    "the spectra are still adequately described by an absorbed power law , although the best - fit parameters differ somewhat from those derived from the gis observations . due to the better overall statistics , and the higher sensitivity to the high energy end of the spectrum , we use the results from the gis",
    "spectral fits in the discussion below .",
    "although we have applied a background subtraction to the gis spectra , the soft thermal emission from the vela snr is spatially variable , and there is significant residual soft flux in some of the regions , as seen in figure 2 .",
    "we have modeled the emission with two components . a thermal model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) was used to account for the soft emission , with the column density fixed at @xmath19 , a typical value for the vela snr ( bocchino , maggio , & sciortino 1999 ; aschenbach , egger , & trmper 1985 ) . an absorbed power law was used for the hard emission .",
    "to emphasize the contribution from vela , we have not included the thermal component in the spectral plots shown here .    the best - fit spectral parameters for",
    "g266.2@xmath01.2  are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the temperature of the thermal component is similar to that observed for the hotter component of vela ( bocchino , maggio , & sciortino 1999 ) , as expected since the gis response is not well - suited to detected the softer component at @xmath20  kev .",
    "the spectral indices for the emission regions along the shell of g266.2@xmath01.2  are all consistent with a value of @xmath21    = 3.5 mm fig .  2. asca spectra from both gis detectors for regions of g266.21.2 . the featureless spectrum is well described by a power law . excess flux at low energies is presumably associated with soft thermal emission from the vela snr .",
    "the column density for the power law component summarized in table 1 is significantly higher than that for vela .",
    "while simple scaling of the column density to estimate the distance to g266.2@xmath01.2  is clearly rather uncertain , it would appear that the remnant is at least several times more distant than vela . to provide some measure of the scaling of quantities , in discussions below",

    "we present the gis spectrum for both ax  j0851.9 - 4617.4 and the diffuse central region of the remnant .",
    "the diffuse emission is well described by a power law of spectral index @xmath60 , again accompanied by a soft thermal component that we associate with vela . given the nonthermal nature of the shell emission , however , it is quite possible that the diffuse central emission is just associated with emission from the shell projected along the central line of sight .",
    "we note that the spectrum of this central emission appears somewhat harder than that from the rest of the remnant , perhaps suggesting a plerionic nature , but more sensitive observations are required to clarify this .",

    "the @xmath62  ks gis exposure ( after screening ) thus yields roughly 500 counts in each detector .",

    "two of particular interest are blackbody emission , as might be expected from the surface of a cooling neutron star or from the polar caps of a neutron star heated through particle acceleration in the magnetosphere , and a power law spectrum that might result from emission directly from a neutron star magnetosphere .",

    "the prevalence of nonthermal x - ray emission in g266.2@xmath01.2  suggests that the remnant is an efficient accelerator of particles .",
    "while thermal emission from swept - up material and shocked ejecta typically dominates the emission of shell - type snrs , there are conditions which can lead to enhanced nonthermal x - ray emission .",
    "recent models for nonlinear shock acceleration in snrs ( e.g. ellison , berezhko , & baring 2000 ) show that the ambient density and magnetic field are critical parameters in determining the relative contributions of thermal and nonthermal electrons in the x - ray emission .",
    "low values of both quantities can yield a synchrotron - dominated remnant in x - rays , while a low magnetic field , in particular , also leads to an increased ratio of the tev @xmath9-ray to radio flux ratio .",
    "this scenario appears consistent with both sn1006 and g347.3@xmath00.5 .",
    "the former is the remnant of a type ia explosion , for which the ejecta mass and ambient density are expected to be relatively low , and is located at a relatively high galactic latitude which is consistent with a low magnetic field .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , is in the galactic plane and appears consistent with a massive star progenitor if the association with surrounding molecular clouds and a nearby region suggested by slane et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is correct .",
    "this , too , would then imply a low ambient density if the remnant has evolved in a stellar wind cavity , which is likely in such a scenario .",
    "both remnants are observed in tev @xmath9-rays ( tanimori et al .",
    "1998 , muraishi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and both are weak radio remnants ( stephenson et al . 1977 , aschenbach 1998 , combi et al .",
    "we note , however , that the circumstances which lead to a dominant nonthermal contribution in the soft x - ray band are complicated .",
    "reynolds ( 1998 ) has shown that the maximum nonthermal x - ray emission relative to the radio emission occurs when the remnant age is comparable to the electron loss time in the postshock magnetic field . however",

    "our limit on the density of any thermally emitting material in the northwest region , where the emission is brightest , is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the filling factor of a sphere taken as the emitting volume in the region extracted .",
    "here we have assumed an equilibrium thermal model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) .",
    "nonequilibrium ionization models can yield higher emissivities , which would lower the derived limit on the density .",
    "we note that this limit is restricted to gas with temperatures above 1  kev because of the severe contributions of soft thermal emission from the vela snr ; higher densities of cooler material in g266.2@xmath01.2  can not be ruled out .",
    "observations of the brightest shell regions with high angular resolution , so as to minimize these contributions , are of considerable interest to further constrain the ratio of thermal to nonthermal emission .    if g266.2@xmath01.2  is actually a source of @xmath1ti at levels indicated by the comptel measurements , so that the age and distance estimates suggested by aschenbach et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and others are correct , then the ambient density is extremely low . the reported @xmath9-ray line flux would indicate a massive star progenitor , and the low density would then imply the presence of a stellar - wind cavity such as that inferred for g347.3@xmath00.5 .",

    "the presence of ob and r associations , as well as  regions , demonstrate that these clouds are sites of recent star formation .",
    "the bulk of the co emission along the line of sight to g266.2@xmath01.2  is concentrated in a velocity range @xmath67 ( murphy & may 1991 ) , and extends down to a galactic latitude of @xmath68 .",
    "the total column density through the ridge is in excess of @xmath69 , with the northeast rim of g266.2@xmath01.2  ( nearest the galactic plane ) falling along the steeply increasing column density region of the ridge while the western rim lies along a line of much lower column density ( figure 4 ) ; the co column density varies by more than a factor of 6 between these regions .",

    "this is consistent with an interpretation in which g266.2@xmath01.2  is the product of a massive progenitor from this star - forming region , and that the remnant evolution has proceeded in the presence of a wind cavity , leading to a low ambient density much like that indicated for g347.3@xmath00.5 .",
    "the angular size of g266.2@xmath01.2  gives a free - expansion age of @xmath71  yr , where @xmath72 is the expansion velocity in units of @xmath73 .",
    "alternatively , using the limit on the preshock density derived above , the sedov age of the remnant is @xmath74  yr , where @xmath75 is the kinetic energy from the explosion in units of @xmath76  erg . in either case",
    ", the remnant is relatively young , although ages as young as those based on the @xmath1ti lifetime would require either an extremely large expansion velocity or an extremely low ambient density unless the remnant distance is actually much less than 1 kpc .",
    "we note that the @xmath77  mev @xmath9-rays that announce the presence of @xmath1ti are actually secondary products .",
    "the decay of @xmath1ti proceeds via electron capture to form @xmath1sc which then decays rapidly to @xmath1ca , producing the observed @xmath9-rays .",
    "as electrons fill the vacancy created by the electron capture , we expect sc - k emission of x - rays at @xmath78  kev . using the fluorescence efficiency of @xmath79 ( krause 1979 )",
    ", we expect a flux @xmath80 based on the @xmath1ti flux of iyudin et al .",
    "we have searched the asca sis data for evidence of such a line feature , but have found no compelling evidence to support its presence .",
    "the sis0 spectrum of one region along the nw rim contains a feature at @xmath81  kev ( figure 5 ) , but is not seen in the sis1 spectrum of the same region , nor in adjacent regions with either detector . using our power law fits , the inclusion of the additional feature is not significant according to the f - test ; the thermal fits of tsunemi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that the feature is significant at the @xmath82 confidence level .",
    "we derive a @xmath83 upper limit of @xmath84 for sc - k emission from this region , which is not inconsistent with the expected result , particularly since additional contributions could come from elsewhere in the remnant .",
    "higher sensitivity searches for such emission are clearly of interest to provide an independent method for obtaining evidence of the presence of @xmath1ti .    the nature of the central compact x - ray source in g266.2@xmath01.2  is poorly constrained by the asca and rosat data .",
    "there are two bright stars ( @xmath85 ) located within the large positional uncertainty ( aschenbach 1998 ) , but neither is a compelling counterpart .",
    "the first star , wray  16 - 30 ( iras 08502 - 4606 ) , is a be star whose position is within 2  arcmin of ax  j0851.9 - 4617.4 . using a thermal model appropriate for",
