    "in fact , an extension of the original lemaitre - eddington model can be termed as emergent universe .",
    "there are several features for the emergent universe viz . @xmath3",
    "the universe is almost static at the infinite past , @xmath4 there is no timelike singularity , @xmath5 the universe is always large enough so that classical description of space time is adequate @xmath6 the universe has accelerated expansion , etc .    however , there was singularity - free solution in the literature since 1967 - harrison described a closed model of the universe with radiation , which coincides with einstein static model in infinite past . but actual search for emergent model of the universe was started ( about 40 years back ) by ellis and collaborators ( 2004 , 2004 ) .",
    "they formulated a closed model of the universe filled with two non - interacting fluids - one is a minimally coupled scalar field having self - interaction potential and the other is a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , they studied only the asymptotic behaviour to characterize the emergent scenario without finding exact analytic solutions .",
    "then mukherjee et .",
    "( 2005 ) solved semi - classical equations in the starobinsky model for flat frw space - time and examined the features of emergent scenario .",
    "subsequently , mukherjee and others ( 2006 ) were able to obtain nonsingular ( i.e. geodesically complete ) inflationary solution where a part of the matter is in exotic form .",
    "mulryne et .",
    "( 2005 ) have discussed the existence and stability of emergent models in the context of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "debnath ( 2008 ) has formulated an emergent model of the universe for exotic matter in the form of phantom or tachyonic field .",
    "banerjee et .",
    "al . ( 2007 , 2008 ) have shown a model of emergent universe in brane scenario while campo et.al .",
    "( 2007)have studied a model of emergent universe for self- interacting brans - dicke theory .",
    "recently , mukerji et.al .",
    "( 2010 , 2010 ) have formulated an emergent universe model in the context of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory and in horava gravity .    in section 2 , we consider a homogeneous and anisotropic space time models described by the line element @xmath8 where the scale factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of time @xmath11 alone .",
    "we note that @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the scalar curvature and the above three types are characterized by thorne ( 1967 ) as flat , closed and open respectively .",

    "the ltb model is one of the most wellknown sphercally symmetric models in general relativity .",
    "it was described by lemaitre ( 1933 ) , tolman ( 1934 ) and bondi ( 1947 ) during the period of time from 1933 to 1947 .",
    "the exact solution have been obtained by bonnor ( 1972 , 1974 ) .",
    "this simple inhomogeneous cosmological model agrees with current supernova and some other data ( moffat 2005 ; moffat 2006 ; alnes 2006 ; alnes 2007 ; romano 2010 , 2010 ) .",
    "also very recently clarkson and marteens ( 2010 ) give a justification for inhomogeneous model from the point of view of perturbation analysis .    the inhomogeneous spherically symmetric ltb space - time model is described by the metric ansatz in a co - moving frame as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the area radius of the spherical surfaces and @xmath25 is the curvature scalar that classifies the space - time as    \\(i ) bounded , if , @xmath26 ,    ( ii)marginally bounded , if , @xmath27 ,    ( iii)unbounded if @xmath28 .    the energy - momentum tensor for perfect fluid is given by @xmath29 where the fluid 4-velocity @xmath30 has normalization @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are respectively the usual matter density and pressure of the fluid .",
    "finally , the paper ends with a brief discussion in section 4 .",
    "the einstein field equations for homogeneous and anisotropic model of the universe with non - interacting two fluid system can be written as : @xmath34\\ ] ] and @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the energy density and pressure of a perfect fluid having equation of state @xmath38 , ( @xmath1,a constant ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the energy - density and pressure of a scalar field @xmath41 having expressions    @xmath42    @xmath43    here @xmath44 is the potential for the scalar field @xmath41 and @xmath45 corresponds to normal or phantom scalar field .",
    "as the two components of the matter field are non - interacting , so the energy conservation equations are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47    for emergent scenario the appropriate form of the scale factors will be according to debnath ( 2008 ) @xmath48^{n}\\ ] ] and @xmath49^{m}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are positive constants .",
