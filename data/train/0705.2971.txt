    "the radio source rc j0311 + 0507 ( the ratan cold catalog ; parijskij et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ) was dis covered in 19801981 observations during the first deep survey of a sky strip with the ratan-600 multifrequency complex ( berlin et al .",
    "the catalog included more than 1145 radio sources with a flux density limit higher than 10 mjy at 7.6 cm .",
    "the ratan-600 observations at various azimuths allowed a positional accuracy of @xmath515to be obtained .",
    "this accuracy is not enough for deep optical identi- fications , but is quite sufficient for deep vla observations .",
    "the absence of catalogs with an adequate sensitivity in those years made it difficult to identify them with known objects .",
    "the first catalog of a high positional accuracy with a sensitivity up to 200 mjy was the utrao ( texas ) catalog at @xmath580 cm ( douglas et al .",
    "douglas kindly provided us data on our surveyed area long before the publication of this catalog .",
    "this allowed us to identify at least the objects of the rc catalog with fairly steep spectra .",
    "there were about one - third of these sources .",
    "rc j0311 + 0507 was one of them .",
    "since its spectral index ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath7 , it was included in the subsample of candidates for distant objects of the big trio project ( goss et al .",
    "1994 ; kopylov et al .",
    "1995 ; parijskij et al .",
    "1999 ; verkhodanov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "note that rc j0311 + 0507 is a fairly bright low - frequency radio source .",
    "it was first detected at a frequency of 85 mhz ( mills et al .",
    "1958 ) and was then reliably recorded at 178 mhz ( gower et al .",
    "1967 ) as the object 4c+04.11 with a flux density of 5.5jy .",
    "rttgering et al .",
    "( 1994 ) independently selected rcj0311 + 0507 to be included in their sample of objects with steep radio spectra ( 365b b0309 + 049 ) .",
    "however , subsequently they did not study it in the optical range , possibly because of an uncertain spectral index .",
    "rcj0311 + 0507 also closely corresponds in its parameters to the objects of the sample of steep - spectrum radio sources by tielens et al .",
    "( 1979 ) .",
    "analysis of this sample revealed the then most distant radio galaxy , 4c+41.17 ( z=3.80 , chambers et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "we have studied the object on vla with a resolution of 1.4 at 21 cm as part of the big trio project ( ratan  vla  bta ) .",
    "the radio source turned out to be compact , about 2  , with an ad ( asymmetric double ) structure .",
    "the vla archival data with a resolution of 0.4 at 6 cm show the presence of a third , very weak component of small angular size .",
    "below , we provide the main data on this object , including the radio data and optical studies with the 6-m bta telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) ( identification , multicolor photometry , and spectroscopy ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the radio spectrum of rc j0311 + 0507 with all of the available measurements collected in the cats database ( verkhodanov et al .",
    "1997 ) , including the ratan-600 multifrequency data .",
    "we also added the measurements at 38 and 178mhz from williams et al .",
    "the curve in fig.1 corresponds to the equation @xmath8 that was obtained by fitting a parabola to all measurements ( 31 data points ) . in the frequency range 3654850mhz",
    ", the object has an ultrasteep spectrum ( @xmath0=1.31 ) , which is the first signature of a high redshift .",
    "the increase in the spectral slope from low to high frequencies is also a characteristic property of distant compact powerful radio sources .    the vla observations carried out by w.m .",
    "goss in june 1995 with a resolution of 1.4 at 1425mhz provided evidence for a compact two - component structure ( parijskij et al .",
    "1996 ) . based on their vla observations with a similar resolution , rottgering et al .",
    "( 1994 ) determined the radio source as an extended one with a size of 1.6 . with the kind permission of b.burke",
    ", we found the image of this object obtained by j.hewitt in 1985 at 4860mhz with a resolution of 0.4 in the vla archive where a linear triplet structure with a total angular size of 2.8 is seen .",
    "based on these data , we can classify rcj0311 + 0507 as a compact steep - spectrum ( css ) object .",
    "it is distinguished by a large flux density asymmetry ( @xmath520 times ) between the two extreme components , which is much more commonly observed in quasars than in radio galaxies .      based on the direct bta image with an exposure time of 400s at 2  seeing obtained in september 1995 with a 580@xmath9520 isd015 ccd array ( pixel size 0.205@xmath90.154 )",
    ", we identified the radio source ( parijskij et al .",
    "1996 ) with a faint galaxy ( r@xmath1022.9 in a 5  aperture ) .",
    "the optical - to - radio luminosity ratio turned out to be the standard one for the population of luminous radio galaxies ( mccarthy 1993 ; parijskij et al .",
    "figure 2 shows the optical object with the superimposed vla 4860mhz isophotes .      in november 1999 , we performed the next observations with the pmccd instrument ( a tx1024a array with 0.206@xmath90.206 pixels ) .",
    "we obtained b , v , r , and i images with exposure times of 600 , 1000 , 400 , and 1000s , respectively , at @xmath52  seeing . the photometric measurements with a 5  aperture corrected for the extinction in the galaxy",
    "( @xmath11=0.83 , @xmath12=0.64 , @xmath13=0.51 , and @xmath14=0.37 ) yielded magnitudes of @xmath1524.9 , 24.8@xmath160.6 , 22.6@xmath160.15 , and 22.3@xmath160.4 , respectively .",
    "the color characteristics are close to those expected for massive galaxies at @xmath17 , and the complete absence of the object in the b band does not contradict to the emission cutoff beyond the lyman 912limit .",
    "the r - band size of the galaxy slightly exceeds its i - band size .",
    "this may suggest the presence of a hydrogen halo around the host galaxy that is commonly observed in distant radio galaxies .",
    "the presence of a halo can lead to a considerable increase in the object s size if the strong ly@xmath0 line falls not far from the passband maximum of the corresponding filter ( see , e.g. , rcj0105 + 0501 ; soboleva et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the ly@xmath0 line increases significantly the v - band size of the object ) .      in september and november 2004",
    ", we obtained bta spectra of the host galaxy .",
    "the observations were carried out with the scorpio universal focal reducer that was put into operation on bta late in 2003 as the main multipurpose , high - efficiency instrument ( afanasiev and moiseev 2005 ) . on november 89 , 2004",
    ", we were able to obtain the best - quality spectrum of the host galaxy with a total exposure time of 3600s in long - slit observations at 1  seeing .",
    "the gr300 g grating provided the entire spectral range accessible to the instrument ( 38009400 ) with a resolution of @xmath520 , which is commonly used to study objects of this type .",
    "the slit width was 1  and the position angle was @xmath1811 .",
    "the spectrum was reduced using the scorpio data reduction and analysis software package ( afanasiev and moiseev 2005 ) and is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the size of the region of integration over the slit height was 1.6 .",
    "the absolute spectrum calibration was performed using the spectrophotometric standard hiltner 600 and is given in units of 10@xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath21@xmath21 .",
    "an intense line is seen at a wavelength of 6703 .",
    "the line flux is @xmath105@xmath22erg @xmath20s@xmath21 , the @xmath23 is @xmath51500 km s@xmath21 , and the equivalent width is @xmath51000 . we interpret it as ly@xmath0 with a redshift of 4.514@xmath160.001 .",
    "the luminosity in this line is close to the ( r - band ) continuum luminosity , which is observed in steep - spectrum radio galaxies only for the ly@xmath0 line ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "the alternative interpretation ( [ o ii ] 3727with @xmath24 ) is highly unlikely because of the complete absence of [ o iii ] 5007 , which is usually twice as intense as [ o ii ] 3727for this population of objects .",
    "the identification with ly@xmath0 is consistent with the weakness of other lines falling into the spectral range studied of which only the c iv 1549line is detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath52 at 10% of the ly@xmath0 intensity .",
    "the ratio of the continuum levels in 400  wide intervals on both sides of ly@xmath0 is @xmath53 .",
    "the lowering of the continuum at wavelengths shortward of ly@xmath0 is attributable to the absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest and is in agreement with the data for quasars at @xmath25(songaila 2004 ) .",
    "in general , the spectrum of rcj0311 + 0507 is similar in its characteristics to the spectra of high - redshift radio galaxies ( see , e.g. , 8c1435 + 63 , @xmath26 , fig.1 in spinrad et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) .",
    "although @xmath1 is considerably lower than the limiting redshifts detected to date , for galaxies ( malhotra and rhoads 2005 ; stanway et al . 2003 ; pello et al . 2004 ) and quasars ( fan et al . 2003 ; walter et al .",
    "2004 ) , rcj0311 + 0507 is only the second luminous radio galaxy detected at a redshift higher than 4.5 .",
    "let us compare the main parameters of rcj0311 + 0507 with those of other radio galaxies at @xmath27 .",
    "only seven such galaxies are known and almost all of them have been studied more or less adequately .",
    "table 1 successively lists the names of the radio galaxies , their redshifts , optical r ( or i ) magnitudes , infrared k magnitudes , 1400-mhz flux densities ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) ( except the object vlaj123642 + 621331 , for which the data were taken from richards ( 2000 ) ) , two - frequency spectral indices @xmath0 from the texas survey ( 365mhz ) and nvss ( with the exception of vla j123642 + 621331 , for which only 1.4 and 8.5ghz measurements are available ; richards 2000 ) , the largest angular sizes ( las ) in arcseconds , and morphology of the radio galaxies in the standard notation ( s  single , d ",
    "double , ad  asymmetric double , c  core , and e  extended ) .",
    "the last column gives references to the publications from which the redshifts , optical magnitudes , infrared magnitudes , and las of the radio sources were taken .    in three cases ( vla j123642 + 621331 , tn j11232154 , and 7c1814 + 670 )",
    ", only a weak ly@xmath0 line was detected ; in the remaining cases , the ly@xmath0 line is very intense . the color data ( after the subtraction of the ly@xmath0 contribution , @xmath507 ) are consistent with new models for evolution of large galaxies .",
    "thus , for example , for the galev2 model ( bicker et al .",
    "2004 ) with the assumed epoch of primary star formation ( @xmath28 ) , the expected colors of the stellar population of an elliptical galaxy are given in table2 .",
    "this table once again confirms that the case with a high redshift is correct . in its redshift ,",
    "rc j0311 + 0507 is second only to the object tn j09242201 ( @xmath29 ) , but this source exceeds it in radio luminosity . having determined the flux density 3.5 jy at 254 mhz ( which corresponds to the emission frequency 1400 mhz at @xmath1 ) using interpolation over the spectrum , we obtain the power of the radio source , 1.3@xmath30w hz@xmath21 ( for @xmath31=70 km s@xmath21mpc@xmath21 , @xmath32=0.3 , and @xmath33=0.7 ) .",
    "rcj0311 + 0507 and 8c1435 + 63 turn out to be similar in their parameters to superpowerful radio galaxies at @xmath27 , which exceed in luminosity cyga , the most powerful nearby radio galaxy , by a factor of @xmath510 .",
    "an ultrahigh radio luminosity is a signature of a supermassive black hole ( @xmath34 ) at the center of the host galaxy .",
    "however , in the standard model , the time scale of its growth from the time of secondary ionization from @xmath35 to @xmath34 is only @xmath50.5 gyr . therefore , the object can be of interest in connection with the problem of age crisis ( cunha and santos 2004 ; loeb and barcana 2001 ) .",
    "not all of the models for the formation of supermassive black holes admit such a fast growth of their masses from several solar masses to @xmath36 ; either severe con straints on the rate of their growth are needed or one must accept the version of primordial ( pregalactic ) large black holes forming stellar systems around themselves that have been often discussed in recent years .",
    "the weakness of other lines in the spectrum ( fig.3 ) suggests that the main emission in the ly@xmath0 line is attributable to a halo that is poorly enriched with heii ( 1640 ) and civ ( 1549 ) . the upper limit on heii and civ obtained by dawson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for distant ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies is 15% ( our value is 10% ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that their conclusion about the primordial nature of the hydrogen gas halo not enriched with nuclear reactions in stars of the host galaxy or population iii stars ( @xmath37 ) ( loeb and barcana 2001 ) for this object is also applicable to rcj0311 + 0507 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to draw the attention of astronomers that are interested in objects of the early universe to the source rcj0311 + 0507 .    with expanding capabilities of the bta optical facilities and with refinement of the selection criteria by taking into account the international experience ,",
