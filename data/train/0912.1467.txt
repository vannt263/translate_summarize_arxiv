    "though real magnetic systems were supposed to be heisenberg - like , the ising model was originally introduced @xcite as a simplified model of magnetic ordering , because its relative simplicity offers better possibilities for a theoretical analysis . in later years , it was found , however , that ising - like magnetic systems do exist .",
    "this is because real systems consist of spins embedded in a crystal lattice , and the resulting anisotropy field due to the neighboring charges may lift the o(3 ) symmetry of an unperturbed spin .",
    "depending on the character of the perturbation , the spin may have an ` easy axis ' or an ` easy plane ' . here",
    "we consider the former case , which leads to ising - like behavior .    in many cases ,",
    "the perturbation is relatively small and the system will approximately behave heisenberg - like , except near an ordering transition where the paramagnetic state transforms into a long - range ordered one . near the transition ,",
    "crossover @xcite occurs to ising - like behavior .",
    "the critical singularities are then described by the ising set of critical exponents . in some other cases ,",
    "the perturbation due to the crystal field is so strong that the magnetic spins assume a true ising character .",
    "this situation occurs when the ionic angular momentum @xmath0 is described by a spin quantum number @xmath1 , and the crystal field lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath2 eigenstates such that the @xmath3 doublet is lowest in energy , with the higher levels so far away that they play no role , even in the presence of exchange interactions between neighboring spins",
    ". then the low - lying doublet can be described by an effective spin-1/2 ising hamiltonian .",
    "this situation is known to occur for the co@xmath4 ion in a tetrahedral coordination .",
    "it occurs also for some rare - earth ions like dy@xmath5 and yb@xmath5 in a sufficiently strong crystal field , with the provision that here the magnetic moments are due to spin as well as orbital angular momentum , and should thus be denoted @xmath6 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "if such ions are embedded in a crystal structure for which theoretical predictions for the thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat exist , comparison with experiments may be possible @xcite .",
    "such comparisons were made for dysprosium phosphate @xcite and for some alkali cobalt halides @xcite .",
    "these systems were found to behave , at least approximately , as the ising models on the diamond lattice and the simple - cubic lattice respectively .",
    "the best way to obtain theoretical results for the thermodynamic properties of these models would obviously be an exact solution , but this is known to be a very difficult problem .",
    "it is thus noteworthy that it was claimed recently by zhang @xcite that a conjectured exact solution was found for the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "however , perk @xcite and wu et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that zhang s result for the free energy and the underlying arguments are flawed . here",
    "it may be added that zhang s result for the critical point of the simple - cubic ising models is not compatible with independent and mutually consistent numerical estimates @xcite . the difference with zhang s result exceeds the estimated numerical accuracies @xcite by several orders of magnitude .    in the absence of an exact solution",
    ", one may still resort to approximations . at temperatures sufficiently far above and below the critical point ,",
    "excellent approximations exist in the form of series expansion of the partition function or the free energy , such as given in refs .   and for the model on the simple - cubic lattice . in the critical region ,",
    "the series of a finite length become inaccurate , and a method to extrapolate these series on the basis of a critical scaling assumption , such as used by butera and comi @xcite , is needed . in the case of rb@xmath7cocl@xmath8 ( rubidium cobalt chloride ) @xcite the required theoretical prediction for the specific heat near criticality was also obtained this way .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed for the specific heat of dypo@xmath9 ( dysprosium phosphate ) @xcite , which was instead compared with series expansions for the diamond lattice .",
    "however , these specific - heat analyses were conducted at a time that the value of the critical exponent @xmath10 was not well known , for instance , @xmath10 was set to zero in ref .  .",
    "moreover , wegner s correction to scaling @xcite was not included .    in order to obtain accurate predictions for the heat capacity in the critical region",
    ", one may apply monte carlo simulations .",
    "cluster simulation methods @xcite , which strongly reduce critical slowing down , allow statistically accurate simulations in the critical region .",
    "extrapolation of the finite - size simulation data to the thermodynamic limit is possible if the simulations cover a range of finite sizes exceeding the correlation length . whereas this still excludes , as a result of the divergence of the correlation length , a narrow temperature range about the critical point ,",
    "one may attempt to describe the extrapolated data by means of a scaling formula .",
    "the present work reports our efforts along this line for the case of the energy and the specific heat of the ising model on the simple - cubic lattice .    in sec .",
    "[ secnum ] we describe our monte carlo simulations , and the extrapolation to infinite system size .",
    "the derivation of scaling formulas for the energy and the specific heat , and the data analysis in terms of these formulas , are presented in sec .",
    "[ secsca ] .",
    "section [ secdis ] discusses the numerical accuracies , provides comparisons with results from series expansions and with a set of experimental results , and ends with a few concluding remarks .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian ( hamiltonian divided by @xmath11 ) of the ising model is denoted @xmath12 where the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 label nearest - neighbor lattice sites on the simple - cubic lattice .",
    "the sum is on all nearest - neighbor pairs , and the spins @xmath15 can assume values @xmath16 .",
    "the coupling is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is minus the energy of a pair of parallel nearest - neighbor spins , @xmath19 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath20 the temperature . the canonical reduced free energy density @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the partition function , @xmath24 the number of spins , and the sum is on all spin configurations @xmath25 .",
    "the energy @xmath26 and the specific heat @xmath27 per particle , as expressed in dimensionless units , follow from the derivatives of @xmath21 to @xmath28 : @xmath29      substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ fr ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ ec ] ) leads to @xmath30 and @xmath31 where the ensemble averages @xmath32 , which are defined as @xmath33 can be sampled directly using importance sampling .",
    "the simulations involved the sampling of the energy , as well as its square , for @xmath34 ising systems on simple - cubic lattices , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the system sizes were chosen as powers of 2 in the range @xmath35 , and in addition as @xmath36 and 12 .",
    "about @xmath37 samples were taken for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "each sample was preceded by a number or wolff cluster steps and/or metropolis sweeps , depending on the value of @xmath28 in comparison with the critical coupling @xmath45 @xcite . for @xmath46 ,",
    "wolff clusters tend to be very small and only metropolis sweeps were applied , and for @xmath47 only wolff cluster steps . in the intermediate range , a few metropolis sweeps were supplemented with a number of wolff cluster steps .",
    "the number of wolff clusters was chosen roughly equal to the inverse of the relative wolff cluster size .",
    "the coupling @xmath28 was given some 50 different values chosen to cover a wide range about the critical point .",
    "the analysis of the numerical finite - size data was done on the basis of well - documented finite - size scaling methods @xcite . for non - critical systems with sizes @xmath48 exceeding the correlation length , the data for the energy should approximately behave as @xmath49 from which the extrapolated energy @xmath50 was obtained by means of a least - squares analysis .",
    "a small - system - size cutoff was applied when necessary to obtain a satisfactory residual @xmath51 .",
    "this cutoff varied between @xmath36 far away from the critical point , and @xmath40 at a distance @xmath52 from the critical point .",
    "no reliable extrapolations were obtained for @xmath53 less than a few times @xmath54 , with the exception of @xmath55 , where one expects that the finite - size - dependent energy converges as a power of @xmath48 , which again enables extrapolation to @xmath56 .",
    "typical estimated accuracies of the extrapolated results for @xmath57 are in the order of @xmath58 .    the same extrapolation procedure was applied to the finite - size data for the specific heat with @xmath59 .",
    "typical accuracies of the extrapolated results for @xmath60 are estimated as at most a few times @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , up to a few times @xmath54 in the vicinity @xmath64 .",
    "the extrapolated data are listed in the appendix .",
    "the analysis of the extrapolated data was done on the basis of scaling as derived from renormalization theory .",
    "the relevant equations follow from the assumptions that the picture described in the following paragraph is valid .",
    "the free energy density @xmath65 of the infinite system , expressed as a function of thermodynamic parameters @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , can be written as the sum of an analytic part @xmath68 and a singular part @xmath69 .",
    "the singular part can be written @xmath70 as a function of wegner s @xcite nonlinear scaling fields @xmath71 , which are analytic functions of the @xmath66 in a neighborhood of a critical point under investigation .",
    "thus @xmath72 the singular part satisfies the scaling equation as implied by the renormalization theory .",
    "a rescaling of the linear dimensions by a factor @xmath73 thus leads to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dimensionality and the @xmath76 are the renormalization exponents associated with the scaling fields @xmath71 , with the temperature exponent @xmath77 positive , and the other exponents negative .",
    "the choice @xmath78 thus yields @xmath79 where @xmath16 has the sign of @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath81 is an analytic function in a neighborhood of the @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .    on the basis of this set of assumptions",
    ", we may taylor expand the free energy in powers of the arguments @xmath66 and @xmath71 , and then expand the @xmath71 s in the @xmath66 s , resulting in an expression depending only on the physical temperature fields , but with expansion coefficients that remain to be determined .",
    "we follow this procedure , restricting number of scaling fields in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ scfs ] ) to two , namely the temperature field @xmath86 and the irrelevant field @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding exponents are denoted @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "the temperature exponent @xmath88 determines the leading singularity in the temperature - induced ordering transition , while the irrelevant exponent @xmath89 generates wegner s correction to scaling @xcite .",
    "expansion of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ scfs ] ) thus yields @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the @xmath14th derivative of @xmath69 to its second argument .",
    "the scaling fields are expanded as analytic power series in the temperature - like parameter @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 the analytic part of the free energy @xmath94 can be expanded directly in powers of @xmath95 . the resulting expansion of the total free energy density in powers of @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be expressed in @xmath28 , the only variable physical temperature parameter in our problem , as given by the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "differentiation of the resulting expansion of the free energy density to @xmath28 yields the dimensionless energy @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath97 dimensions , the leading terms are included in @xmath98 @xmath99 where we have included the first three terms in the sum on @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ fsex ] ) , and @xmath100 is an analytic function of @xmath92 related to @xmath101 by @xmath102 the dimensionless specific heat @xmath60 of the model ( [ h0 ] ) satisfies @xmath103 and its expansion thus follows by differentiation of the energy , eq .",
    "( [ eexp ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath104 @xmath105 the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath100 , and their derivatives as they appear in eqs .",

    "( [ fsex ] ) includes , in principle , infinitely many terms , for numerical work it is necessary to truncate the expansion of @xmath69 , as well as those of @xmath94 and the scaling fields , at a finite order .",
    "expression ( [ eexp ] ) for the energy already contains the implicit simplification that there is only one irrelevant field , and that the expansion of @xmath112 is truncated at second order .",
    "moreover , higher orders in the expansion of the temperature derivative of the irrelevant field were neglected .",
    "we shall reconsider these simplifications in sec .",
    "[ errdis ] .",
    "no further simplifications were made in the derivation of eq .",

    "( [ eexp ] ) and ( [ sphex ] ) depend on the same parameters , the data for the energy and the heat capacity were simultaneously fitted by one set of parameters .",
    "a fit was considered satisfactory if it met three criteria : first , the residual @xmath51 has to be compatible with the number of degrees of freedom ; second , there should be sufficiently large ranges of overlap with the accurate predictions from the low- and high - temperature series expansions ; and third , at least the amplitudes of the leading terms in the fit formulas should be reasonably stable under variations of the @xmath28-interval and of the number of correction terms in the temperature field and the analytic background . in table [ tab : parms ] we list the smallest satisfactory set of parameters thus obtained .",
    "we skipped the ellipses in eqs .",
    "( [ eexp ] ) and ( [ sphex ] ) , and included terms up to order @xmath113 in the expansion of @xmath96 , up to @xmath114 in that of @xmath100 , and up to @xmath115 in the analytic parts expressed by the first sums in eqs .",
    "( [ eexp ] ) and ( [ sphex ] ) .",
    "the residual of this fit was @xmath116 , to be compared with the number of degrees of freedom @xmath117 .",
    "since possible correlations between specific heat and energy data could influence the estimation of the errors in the fitted parameters , we have analyzed the correlations between the deviations of the energy and of the specific heat with respect to the fit formula .",
