    "dynamical modeling of the kinematic data of numerous nearby galaxies has revealed that central dark objects of @xmath6@xmath7 @xmath3  are nearly ubiquitous .",
    "these central dark objects are generally assumed to be supermassive black holes , the remnants of quasars which were much more numerous in the past .",
    "another population of black holes , those with masses of @xmath0320 @xmath3 , is known from determinations of the binary parameters of 18 x - ray binaries in the milky way and magellanic clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bridging the gap between these two populations , i.e. , finding intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , has been a long - standing goal .",
    "some evidence for imbhs has come from application of the dynamical modeling technique to globular clusters , which has found central dark objects in a couple of cases . @xcite and @xcite claimed that the milky way globular cluster m15 hosted a central imbh with a mass of @xmath8  @xmath3 , and @xcite argued that the andromeda cluster g1 hosted an imbh of @xmath9  @xmath3 .",
    "both of these claims were challenged by @xcite .    the case for m15 hosting a central imbh",
    "was weakened by the discovery of a mislabeling of axes @xcite , but the case for g1 has recently been strengthened by new , high - quality data @xcite .",
    "some relevant physical parameters for g1 are given in table  [ tab : g1 ] .",
    "@xcite have suggested that g1 could be the stripped core of a dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "if a globular cluster does indeed host a central imbh , and if it contains some amount of ionized gas ( as has been observed in 47 tuc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one might reasonably expect the imbh to accrete the gas via a bondi - hoyle - lyttleton process @xcite and become an observable x - ray and/or radio source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite reported that a search for a central x - ray source in a _",
    "chandra _",
    "observation of m15 yielded a null result .",
    "we report here on the detection of x - rays from g1 with _ xmm - newton_. this x - ray detection may be emission from a central imbh but is also consistent with emission from a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "the observations are described in  [ sec : obs ] and the analysis in  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the possible interpretations in  [ sec : discuss ] and briefly conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "_ xmm _  has observed g1 on three occasions .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "we downloaded the reprocessed european photon imaging camera ( epic ) data for each observation from the _ xmm _  science archive .",
    "epic consists of three separate cameras : one pn ccd array and two mos ccd arrays .",
    "the first observation had g1 at the aimpoint , but the other two included g1 at a considerable off - axis angle , which reduced the effective area due to vignetting . to give a sense of this , we list in table  [ tab : obslog ] the effective area of the pn instrument at 1 kev , as determined from the ancillary response files .",
    "the _ xmm _  optical monitor was off for the first observation and did not include g1 in the field of view for the other two observations .",
    "we used the _ xmm _  science analysis system ( sas ) version 6.5.0 ( obtained from the _ xmm _   science operations centre ) for the reduction of the data .",
    "the second observation suffered from intense background flaring , and we filtered out the worst flaring periods to use only a few timeframes which were relatively unaffected .",
    "this resulted in a significantly reduced exposure time .",
    "we extracted spectra from the location of g1 for each instrument for each observation and constructed response matrices and ancillary response files using sas .",
    "we used large , nearby , source - free regions to extract background spectra .",
    "the photometry based on these extractions is given in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "we have combined the detected counts from the pn and both mos instruments . because the exposure time and effective area vary greatly between instruments and observations , we report both net counts and net count flux .",
    "we use the mean effective areas over 0.2 to 10 kev to calculate the fluxes .",
    "an image of the first observation is shown in figure  [ fig : xmmhst ] in which the photons have been color - coded according to energy .",
    "we also show a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "image of g1 taken with the advanced camera for surveys with the f555w filter .",
    "this multidrizzled image was downloaded from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute .",
    "since the count fluxes of all three observations are consistent with each other , we use only the first for spectral analysis because it has the best signal to noise ratio .",
    "we jointly fit the three spectra ( from the pn and both mos instruments ) from the first observation in sherpa @xcite using an absorbed power law model .",
    "we considered only the 0.210 kev band , and the spectra were grouped to contain at least 3 counts per bin .",
    "we used @xmath10 statistics with the @xcite estimate of the standard deviation of each bin .",
    "the column density was constrained to be at least equal to the galactic value of @xmath11  @xmath12  .",
    "the parameters of the best fit are given in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "they are not well constrained .",

    "( of course , the fraction of the energy emitted in the x - ray band may be considerably smaller than unity . ) in order for hydrodynamic accretion to take place , the gas most likely has to be ionized ( for mean free paths to be shorter than the accretion radius ) , and an ionized state may be achieved by the uv from only one or two post - agb stars in the cluster .",
    "@xcite argued that the wind from cluster agb stars could maintain the intercluster gas density at @xmath00.11 @xmath28 , even after the cluster is completely stripped of its gas upon passing through the galactic plane of the host galaxy .",
    "direct empirical evidence for a substantial ionized gas density in 47 tuc , via observations of differential dispersion measures of the resident radio pulsars @xcite , yields a value of @xmath29 @xmath28 which confirms the possibility that globular clusters may indeed contain a non - negligible density of ionized gas .",
    "the case of bondi - hoyle accretion by an imbh is complicated by the large number of field stars that are likely to be contained within an accretion radius . the accretion radius used to derive eq.(1 )",
    "is : @xmath30 according to fig.6 of @xcite , there are more than @xmath31 stars within @xmath00.4 pc of the center of g1 .",
    "thus , we should consider both the dynamical effect of such stars on any gas present and the direct injection of gas into the accretion volume via the stellar winds of these stars .",
    "we start by considering the collective effects of the stellar wind from the stars neighboring the imbh .",
    "each star has a stellar wind intensity and speed that depend sensitively on its evolutionary state .",
    "we assume that these winds collide and their bulk kinetic energies are thermalized .",

    "we take the evolution of this one star to represent an ensemble of stars in different evolutionary states .",
    "we utilized a simplified evolution code @xcite with a wind loss prescription that is a modified version of reimers ( 1975 ) expression .",
    "the reimers wind is enhanced as a function of the star s mass and radius ( see eq.[15 ] in soker & rappaport 2000 ) so as to reproduce the initial - final mass relation for the production of white dwarfs in single stars @xcite .",
    "we take the terminal wind speed , @xmath45 , to be equal to the escape speed from the stellar surface . during the evolution of our representative cluster star we tabulated two integrals : @xmath46 from these",
    "we compute the mass - weighted mean specific kinetic energy and the mean mass - loss rate from the winds : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the evolution time from the zams to the end of the agb phase .    from these calculations",
    "we find the rms wind speed after collisional thermalization to be @xmath49 km s@xmath50 , while the average value of @xmath51 yr@xmath50 .",
    "of course , the bulk of the wind loss contribution comes from stars on the giant branch or agb .",
    "if we utilize this wind speed in eq.(4 ) we estimate @xmath52 pc . based on the central density @xmath34",
    ", there are @xmath0425 @xmath3  of stars in this volume , the bulk of which should be composed of the most massive cluster stars , near the turnoff or in the giant phase , which will have preferentially sunk to the cluster center .",
    "these @xmath0500 stars could produce a total mass injection rate , via stellar winds , @xmath53@xmath54 yr@xmath50 .",
    "this is approximately 100 times more than is needed to power the observed @xmath55 from the vicinity of g1 . finally , we point out that since the rms speed of the cluster stars is lower than the rms thermal velocities that we estimate ( @xmath56 km s@xmath50 ) , the dynamical effects of the stars on the gas are probably negligible",
    ".      in the milky way , we know of 13 lmxbs in twelve globular clusters with @xmath57  @xmath5  ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "five of these sources are recurrent transients , and the other seven are persistently luminous . @xcite",
    "have shown that the number of globular cluster close binaries observable as faint x - ray sources ( e.g. , lmxbs in quiescence , cataclysmic variables , active main - sequence binaries ) scales as the `` encounter frequency '' of the cluster , which goes roughly as @xmath58 . in their units , g1 has an encounter frequency of @xmath07500 and would be expected to host @xmath075 lmxbs , the vast majority in quiescence . if some small number of those lmxbs were in outburst during each of the three _ xmm _  observations , it could explain the observed x - ray emission .",

    "the first is by its location with respect to the cluster center , where the more massive the object the closer it is likely to be found to the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "near the cluster core , the stellar density approaches a constant value , and the cluster potential grows as @xmath60 .",
    "if black holes ( bhs ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and field stars are in rough energy equipartition , then we expect the rms black hole velocity to scale as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are typical neutron star masses and velocities .",
    "thus , we would anticipate that any imbh would be confined within a radius of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the radius containing about half the neutron stars in the cluster ( for a more detailed discussion see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , the neutron star distribution in clusters follows that of the field stars , but with a characteristic radial scale that is @xmath060% that of the field stars . therefore",
    ", we expect half of the lmxbs in g1 to be within @xmath0@xmath66 of the center , but a 20,000 @xmath3  imbh to be within 50 milliarcsec of the center .",
    "unfortunately , the spatial resolution of _ xmm _  does not allow for such a test , but a _ chandra _  observation could easily localize the x - ray emission to a fraction of an arcsecond .",
    "if there are at least a few x - ray / optical coincidences in the _ chandra _  field of view , it should be possible to register the _ chandra _  and _ hst _  frames to 0102 accuracy .",
    "with such a registration , an imbh should be essentially coincident with the center of g1 , and there is a good chance that any detected lmxb would be certifiably removed from the center .",

    "it has been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that a cool multicolor disk spectral component , indicating a relatively low inner disk temperature , might indicate the presence of an imbh .",
