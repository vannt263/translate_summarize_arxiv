    "<S> in this letter we update our predictions for exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction in proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions at the run 2 lhc energies obtained with the color dipole formalism and considering the impact parameter color glass condensate model ( bcgc ) for the forward dipole - target scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the lhcb data on rapidity distributions and photon - hadron cross sections is presented . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the current data can be quite well described by the bcgc model , which takes into account nonlinear effects in the qcd dynamics and reproduces the very precise hera data , without introducing any additional effect or free parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of photon - induced processes in hadronic collisions @xcite became a reality in the last years @xcite and new data associated to the run 2 of the lhc are expected to be released soon . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , we expect that these new data allow us to get answers for several important open questions of the standard model ( sm ) as well as to shed some light on possible beyond sm physics ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one these questions is related to the treatment of the qcd dynamics at high energies and large nuclei @xcite , which is probed in exclusive vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions @xcite . in the last years , this process was studied by several theoretical groups considering different formalisms and underlying assumptions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we estimated the exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction in hadronic collisions within the dipole formalism considering different models for the vector meson wave functions and/or for the forward dipole - hadron scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have presented a comparison with the run 1 lhc data and demonstrated that our predictions were able to describe those data if the nonlinear effects in the qcd dynamics are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> although in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have presented some predictions for future runs of the lhc , they were calculated for center of mass energies different from those that are being considered for the run 2 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the motivations for this letter , is to present predictions that can be directly compared with the expected run 2 data . </S>",
    "<S> another one is to present for the first time a comparison between our predictions and the data on the energy dependence of the total @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) cross section , which have been extracted from the data on rapidity distributions of the vector mesons photoproduced in hadronic collisions . finally , as a by product </S>",
    "<S> , we also present a comparison of our prediction @xcite for the exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 tev with the lhcb data @xcite that have been released after the publication of our previous paper .    </S>",
    "<S> initially , let us present a brief review of the main concepts needed to describe the photon  induced interactions in hadronic collisions and the formalism used in our calculations ( for a detailed discussion see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea in photon - induced processes is that an ultra relativistic charged hadron ( proton or nucleus ) gives rise to strong electromagnetic fields , such that the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( photon - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) @xcite . in these processes </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target cross section . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on exclusive vector meson production in photon  </S>",
    "<S> hadron interactions in hadronic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section for the production of a vector meson @xmath6 at rapidity @xmath7 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath8}{dy }   =   \\left[\\omega \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_1}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_2   \\rightarrow v \\otimes h_2}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_l }    +   \\left[\\omega \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_2}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_1 \\rightarrow v \\otimes h_1}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_r}\\ , \\label{dsigdy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the rapidity ( @xmath7 ) of the vector meson in the final state is determined by the photon energy @xmath9 in the collider frame and by the mass @xmath10 of the vector meson [ @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath12 is the total cross section of exclusive vector meson photoproduction , with the symbol @xmath13 representing the presence of a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath14 and @xmath15 denoting photons from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 hadrons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath18 denotes the equivalent photon spectrum of the relativistic incident hadron , with the flux of a nucleus being enhanced by a factor @xmath19 in comparison to the proton one . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsigdy ] ) takes into account the fact that both incident hadrons can be sources of the photons which will interact with the other hadron , with the first term on the right - hand side of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsigdy ] ) being dominant at positive rapidities while the second term dominating at negative rapidities due to the fact that the photon flux has support at small values of @xmath9 , decreasing exponentially at large @xmath9 . as in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we will assume that the photon flux associated to the proton and nucleus can be described by the dress - zeppenfeld @xcite and the relativistic point  </S>",
    "<S> like charge@xcite models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , in our calculations of exclusive vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions we will assume that the rapidity gap survival probability @xmath20 ( associated to probability of the scattered proton not to dissociate due to secondary interactions ) is equal to the unity . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of these absorption effects in @xmath21 interactions is still a subject of intense debate @xcite .    the main input in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsigdy ] ) is the @xmath22 cross section , which can be written as @xmath23 with the amplitude for producing an exclusive vector meson diffractively being given in the color dipole formalism by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the wave function overlap between the photon and vector meson wave functions , @xmath26 is the momentum transfer and @xmath27 is the impact parameter of the dipole relative to the hadron target . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the dipole transverse radius and the momentum fraction of the photon carried by a quark ( an antiquark carries then @xmath30 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is the forward dipole - target scattering amplitude ( for a dipole at impact parameter @xmath27 ) which encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the nonlinear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the @xmath21 center - of - mass reaction energy , @xmath32^{1/2}$ ] , through the variable @xmath33 . as in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in what follows we will consider the boosted gaussian model @xcite for the overlap function and the impact parameter color glass condensate ( bcgc ) model @xcite for the dipole  </S>",
    "<S> proton scattering amplitude @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these models allow us to successfully describe the high precision combined hera data on inclusive and exclusive processes . in the case of a nuclear target </S>",
    "<S> , we will assume that the forward dipole - nucleus amplitude can be expressed as follows @xmath35 \\,\\ , , \\label{enenuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the nuclear profile function , which is obtained from a 3-parameter fermi distribution for the nuclear density normalized to @xmath37 , and the @xmath38 is the dipole - proton cross section is expressed by @xmath39 with @xmath34 given by the bcgc model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , as in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we also include in our calculations the corrections associated to the real part of the amplitude and the skewness factor , which is related to the fact that the gluons attached to the @xmath40 pair can carry different light - cone momentum fractions @xmath41 , @xmath42 of the target .     and @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath4 ( left panel ) and @xmath43 ( right panel ) collisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath4 ( left panel ) and @xmath43 ( right panel ) collisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .total cross sections for the exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath4 and @xmath43 collisions at the run 2 lhc energies . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] we present our predictions for the rapidity distributions for exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath4 ( upper panel ) and @xmath43 ( lower panel ) collisions considering the center of mass energies of the run 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the corresponding cross sections are show in table [ tab1 ] . in comparison with our previous predictions </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we observe that the values are smaller by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that the bcgc predictions for the @xmath1 production in @xmath43 collisions are being presented for the first time , since in our previous paper @xcite this scenario was not considered .     </S>",

    "<S> data from lhcb collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    in what follows we will concentrate our analysis on exclusive vector meson photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions , which was studied by the lhcb collaboration and allows us to do a more detailed comparison of our predictions with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the lhcb collaboration has recently released @xcite the first ( preliminary ) data on exclusive @xmath0 production at @xmath45 tev . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we compare our predictions for the rapidity distributions measured in exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 ( upper panel ) and 13 tev ( lower panel ) with the corresponding lhcb data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the bcgc predictions describe these data quite well , without the need of modifying the original parameters of the model or introducing any additional physical effect . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( upper panel ) we present our predictions for exclusive @xmath1 production and compare them with the lhcb data for @xmath5 tev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that also for this final state , the bcgc model successfully describes the data . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction for @xmath45 tev , which is expected to be reached in the run 2 , is also presented ( lower panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of our prediction with future experimental data will be an important check of the bcgc model , since @xmath1 production probes smaller dipole separations in comparison to @xmath0 production . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath0 photoproduction is expected to probe the nonlinear regime of the qcd dynamics , the @xmath1 should be sensitive to the transition between the linear and nonlinear regimes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we believe that a unified description of the exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction is one important test of the underlying dynamics .     </S>",

    "<S> data from hera @xcite and lhcb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]   ( upper panel ) and @xmath1 ( lower panel ) @xmath46 cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> data from hera @xcite and lhcb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    one of the main motivations to study the rapidity distributions is that they allow us to access the energy dependence of the @xmath22 cross sections in a new kinematical range , which was not probed e.g. in @xmath47 collisions at hera . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of nonlinear effects in the qcd dynamics is predicted to modify the energy behavior of the cross sections , since the growth of the energy implies that smaller values of @xmath48 are probed in the forward dipole  </S>",
    "<S> target scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the difference of masses between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the studies of both mesons are complementary . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we compare our predictions with the lhcb data derived following the procedure presented in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , in the upper panel we can see that our predictions describe quite well the preliminary lhcb data on the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath45 tev , which can not be described by a simple power - law fit of the hera data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar agreement is also observed in the case of the @xmath1 production , shown in the lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions are not unexpected , since the bcgc model describes the data for the rapidity distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us summarize our main conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental results have demonstrated that the study of hadronic physics using photon induced interactions in @xmath49 colliders is feasible . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath21 interactions at lhc probe a kinematical range unexplored by previous colliders . the outcoming data on exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction in hadronic collisions probe a kinematical range where nonlinear effects are expected to strongly affect the qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in our previous studies , we have shown that using the dipole framework and taking into account saturation effects ( as in the bcgc model ) we are able to describe the run 1 lhc data . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have updated our comparison with the run 1 lhcb data and we present our predictions for the energies considered in the run 2 . our results demonstrated that the bcgc model reproduces the run 1 data as well as the preliminary data on @xmath4 collisions at @xmath45 tev . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have shown that the model also is able to describe the current data on the @xmath2 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the bcgc model is also able to describe the inclusive and exclusive hera data , these results suggest that in order to understand @xmath21 interactions at high energies we need to take into account qcd nonlinear effects . </S>",
    "<S> we strongly believe that a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data on exclusive light and heavy vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions at the run 2 will allow to discriminate between the different approaches to the qcd dynamics . </S>"
