    "this is an exciting time to tackle these question , because cosmological observations are finally becoming sensitive enough to help answer them .",
    "all inflation models solve the above - mentioned pre-1980 problems ( the flatness problem , the horizon problem , ) .",
    "in addition , as illustrated in and elaborated in @xcite , inflation may explain the values of as many as eight observable cosmological parameters ( the last eight in table 1 ) , including those associated with dark energy . in the last few years",
    ", an avalanche of new cosmological data has revolutionized our ability to measure these parameters using tools such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy clustering , gravitational lensing , the lyman alpha forest , cluster abundances and type ia supernovae @xcite , and i have worked hard to help carry this out in practice . in one suite of papers , i developed methods for analyzing cosmological data sets using information theory ( , @xcite and applied them to various cmb experiments and galaxy redshift surveys ( , @xcite ) , often in collaboration with the experimentalists / observers who had gathered the data .",
    "another series of papers tackled various `` dirty laundry '' issues such as microwave foregrounds and mass - to - light bias ( , @xcite ) .",
    "other papers developed and applied techniques for clarifying the big picture in cosmology : comparing and combining diverse cosmological probes , cross - checking for consistency and constraining cosmological models and their free parameters ( , @xcite ) .    -1.5",
    "cm    a robust prediction common to essentially all inflation models is that we should measure negligible curvature @xmath9 , strikingly confirmed by recent precision measurements such as @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "most models also predict approximately scale - invariant seed fluctuations ( @xmath12 ) , in good agreement with the recent measurement @xmath13 @xcite ( ) .",
    "however , data are now getting sensitive enough to look for small departures from `` vanilla '' ( scale - invariant , scalar , adiabatic and gaussian ) fluctuations , at least one of which is expected for essentially all published inflation models , so it is important and timely to work out the detailed predictions of competing models .    -4.1",
    "cm    =    -1 cm    =    however , this theoretical calculation is proving surprisingly difficult !",
    "the reason is that most models predict a complicated spacetime with infinitely many observers @xcite , some of which measure different parameter values from others .",
    "the first 25 parameters in table 1 will at least be constant within each level ii universe , but the last 5 can vary even between level i universes , depending not only on which potential energy minimum the so - called inflaton field(s ) rolled down into , but also on the path by which it got there . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this means that generic inflation models ( all models except ones that are perfectly symmetric around a single unique minimum ) will predict not definite parameter values , but merely a probability distribution as in .",
    "moreover , as elaborated in @xcite , computing this probability distribution for what an observer should expect to measure ( and hence making inflation testable ) requires solving technical problems directly involving the more philosophical - sounding aspects of inflation :    1 .",
    "the answer depends on the definition of `` observer '' ( whether we compute the parameter distribution seen from a random point , a random proton , a random galaxy , a random planet , ) .",
    "2 .   the answer depends on the order ( ! ) in which the infinitely many observers are counted .",
    "3 .   the answer may depend on pre - inflationary initial conditions .    in spite of early difficulties , the daunting problem of how to predict probabilities",
    "was successfully overcome in both classical statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics , making me hopeful that inflation will follow suit .",
    "building on @xcite , i am currently tacking these problems on several fronts , together with colleagues , as well as pursuing more hands - on calculations .",
    "in the endevour to understand where everything comes from , two partial answers have in my opinion been found :    * q : where does the observed _ matter _ come from ? + a : inflation can produce it all from almost nothing . *",
    "q : where does the observed _ complexity _ come from ? + a : parallel universes can produce it all from almost nothing , with the fundamental laws being simple and almost all the complexity existing only in the mind of the beholder , since the individual parallel universes require vastly more information to describe than the multiverse as a whole @xcite .    in conclusion , the age - old question `` how did it all begin '' has been dramatically refined in recent years , transformed into a quest to understand cosmological inflation and physics at the highest energies .",
    "in this quest , parallel experimental and theoretical progress has fruitfully connected mainstream empirical work to fundamental theoretical research that in turn has profound philosophical implications regarding our cosmic origin , our cosmic future , fundamental / environmental laws and parallel universes . in other words , looking ahead , if has never been more interesting than now to ask how it all began .",

    "<S> = 8.5 cm    first , the notion of `` it all '' was dramatically expanded by edwin hubble s 1925 discovery that the contemporary `` universe '' of nearby stars was merely part of one galaxy among countless others @xcite . today </S>",
    "<S> , most astronomers casually use the word `` universe '' to denote the spherical volume shown in , the cosmic event horizon containing about @xmath3 atoms and everything else we can in principle observe .    </S>",
    "<S> second , it has become clear that this universe is not static , but dynamic and evolving . </S>",
    "<S> spectacular recent measurements enabled by detector , computer and space technology have brought us a consistent quantitative picture of how our universe expanded and evolved from a hot , fiery event known as the big bang some 14 billion years ago . </S>",
    "<S> our universe has expanded ever since the big bang , and this continuous stretching of space has both diluted and cooled the particles permeating it ( ) . as everything cooled , particles combined into progressively more complex structures . </S>",
    "<S> quarks combined to form protons and neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> later , when the cosmic temperature was comparable to the core of a star , fusion reactions combined neutrons and some of the protons into light elements like helium , deuterium and lithium . </S>",
    "<S> about 400,000 years after the big bang , the leftover protons combined with electrons to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms , making the cosmos essentially transparent to light . up until this point , matter was extremely uniform , with only tiny @xmath4-level density variations from place to place , but gravitational attraction gradually clumped atoms together into galaxies , stars and planets , allowing atoms to form complex structures like molecules , cells , people and societies .    by the time i was born , </S>",
    "<S> the question `` how did it all begin ? '' had thus been refined to inquiring about what happened when our universe was less than a second old . </S>",
    "<S> this included some particularly disturbing sub - questions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , why is space so big , so old and so flat , when generic initial conditions predict the curvature to grow over time and the density to fast approach either zero or infinity ( the `` flatness problem '' ) ? what mechanism generated the @xmath4 level `` seed '' fluctuations ( visible as cosmic microwave background fluctuations in ) out of which all cosmic structure grew , and what conspiracy caused these fluctuations to have nearly identical amplitude in regions of space that had never been in causal contact ( the `` horizon problem '' ) ?      =    around when i started high school in 1982 , it was discovered that a process known as _ inflation _ , involving a nearly exponential stretching of space , could solve these and other problems in one fell swoop @xcite , and it soon emerged as the most popular theory for what happened very early on . </S>",
    "<S> inflation is simple and elegant , requiring merely the existence of some form of matter that stubbornly refuses to have its density diluted as space expands ( see @xcite for reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic density fluctuations are explained as the quantum fluctuations required by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , magnified by the stretching of space and amplified by gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> previous breakthroughs in theoretical physics like relativity theory and quantum mechanics not only solved old problems , but also transformed and deepened our understanding of the nature of physical reality . </S>",
    "<S> inflation did the same . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it soon became clear that inflation is generically eternal @xcite , so that even though inflation has ended in the part of space that we inhabit ( ) , it still continues elsewhere and will ultimately produce an infinite number of other post - inflationary volumes as large as ours , forming a cosmic fractal of sorts .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as illustrated in , independent progress in theoretical physics has gradually shifted the borderline between `` laws of physics '' and `` initial conditions '' at the expense of the former . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a common feature of much string theory related model building is that there is a `` landscape '' of solutions , corresponding to spacetime configurations involving different dimensionality , different types of fundamental particles and different values for certain physical `` constants '' . as an example , table 1 lists the 30 parameters specifying the standard models of particle physics and cosmology , some or all of which may vary across the landscape . </S>",
    "<S> eternal inflation transforms such potentiality into reality , actually creating regions of space realizing each of these possibilities . however , each such region where inflation has ended is generically infinite in size , making it impossible for any inhabitants to travel to other regions where these apparent laws of physics are different .    table  1 : the 19 parameters of the @xmath5 standard model of particle physics , compiled from @xcite , followed by 11 cosmological parameters as compiled in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> massive neutrinos require additional parameters . </S>",
    "<S> planck units are used , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined so that the higgs potential is @xmath8 .    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we define parallel universes as regions that are for all practical purposes disconnected ( outside of causal contact for much longer than the lifetime of any observers ) , then these post - inflationary regions are an example thereof . </S>",
    "<S> they are labeled as  level ii \" in figure  , which is my attempt from @xcite to classify various types of parallel universes that have been discussed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> since each such level 2 parallel universe is infinite in size , it consists of infinitely many spheres as in  this level i multiverse is much less diverse , with the only difference between the spheres being the initial matter distribution ( the initial conditions in the limited sense of classical physics  see ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the inflationary fluctuations are of quantum origin , inflation also populates the level iii multiverse ( if quantum mechanics is applicable to this multiverse as a whole ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will return to level iv below .    </S>",
    "<S> so how did it all begin ? </S>",
    "<S> although inflation gives a beautifully unified answer to the conundra of the 1970 s , we have seen that it still only refines the initial query further , leaving us with a number of questions :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> how can we test whether inflation really happened ? 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> what is the physics underlying inflation ? </S>",
    "<S> ( what is this hard - to - dilute substance ? ) 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> why has inflation recently restarted ? </S>",
    "<S> ( what is the dark energy currently accelerating our universe ? ) 4 .   how did inflation begin ? </S>",
    "<S> or did it ?    </S>",
    "<S> thus addressing the question of how it all began is highly relevant also to other key questions in physics , such as the quest for the correct theory at the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> probing inflation might offer our best hope to test string theory and other quantum gravity candidates , since the early universe is an unmanned physics experiment probing energy scales vastly exceeding those accessible in laboratories . </S>"
