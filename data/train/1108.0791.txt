    "those points shift their positions toward the center of the brillouin zone with increasing pressure @xcite . in the vicinity of each contact point ,",

    "the massless dirac electron system has been also found in graphene which is a single layer of graphite @xcite .",

    "since the conductive layers are separated by the insulating layers , interlayer transfer energy is sufficiently small and thus this system has a strong 2d nature .",
    "it has theoretically been explained by osada @xcite that the experimentally observed negative interlayer magnetoresistance @xcite is due to the zero - mode landau level of the massless dirac fermion .",

    "two dirac cone locations in the brillouin - zone also move by pressure , therefore the distance between valleys would be changed .",
    "this feature is very intriguing , because the inter - valley scattering effect would be affected by the change of dirac cone locations .    in this paper",
