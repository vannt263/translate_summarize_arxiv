    "the relative simplicity of the implementation and theoretical analysis of gaussian states and operations comes at a prize @xcite : distillation is provably not possible ! in order to distil the entanglement of gaussian states , one must carry out non - gaussian operations and , at least for a while , leave the set of gaussian states @xcite . although distillation of quantum entanglement is not possible with gaussian states and operations , distillation of a quantum key for cryptography",

    "given the current experimental interest and the relative simplicity , it is worth while to investigate how well one may use gaussian states and operations to entangle remote continuous variable quantum systems , coupled by a lossy quantum channel , and to address the related question about how well one may teleport an unknown quantum state by use of the entangled channel .",

    "it is an interesting observation , that the no - distillation theorem precludes us from establishing several such entangled ensemble pairs and concentrating the entanglement into a single system , whereas during the optical probing of the atomic samples , the atomic entanglement _ is _ indeed increasing due to the sequential transmission of more and more segments of the light beam , which are also continuous variable quantum systems .",

    "these results mean that no matter the loss it is always possible ( assuming that the appropriate squeezed probe light source is available ) to entangle the two gases to a high level .    the crossed curve is given by eq .   for the symmetric epr light source operated at a finite degree of squeezing @xmath181 .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] that the atom - light setup leads to a higher degree of entanglement than the epr light source except in a narrow range around @xmath179 .",
    "in particular for losses exceeding @xmath183 40 % , the asymmetric setup presents an efficient way to generate a high and constant degree of entanglement .",
    "in summary , we have studied the effects of ( light ) losses on the achievable entanglement between two locations coupled by a lossy transmission line .",
    "we characterize the entanglement by the argument @xmath29 of the logarithmic negativity @xmath0 .",
    "the entanglement of atomic samples by optical probing is experimentally interesting because it works with classical optical sources and because the entangled states are stored in stationary media for potential later use .",
    "if only coherent light is available , the entanglement obtained with light being sent in both directions between the gases and with probing of suitable combinations of both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 atomic variables yields @xmath184 , and the gases become entangled as long as the losses are below 80 % .",
    "when squeezed light is available , we both have the possibility to simply prepare and send entangled light pulses over the transmission channel and we may use the squeezed light to improve the atomic probing schemes . for low losses , and with no limits to the degree of squeezing , the mere emission of entangled light pulses yields the largest entanglement , but if the degree of available optical squeezing is limited , it becomes advantageous to use probed atomic samples , and , quite surprisingly we showed that for large losses , a one - way probing scheme with anti - squeezed light leads to a finite negativity @xmath1 and a logarithmic negativity as large as @xmath185 for any value of the loss .",
    "when the loss approaches unity , the required degree of anti - squeezing and probing time get larger , but as shown in fig .",
    "realistic squeezing levels suffice to give surprisingly small @xmath29 for large losses .",
    "entangled states have been proposed for various quantum communication tasks , and since losses set a practical limit on the distance over which these tasks can be carried out , a scheme that attains high entanglement despite losses is of course interesting . to investigate",
    "if our entanglement is useful , we present a brief analysis of the achievements of the entangled gases for continuous variables teleportation  @xcite .",
    "we have recently presented a general analysis of fidelities for gaussian state transformations , including teleportation  @xcite , and for an entangled channel of the form ( 3 ) , we reproduced the known fidelity for teleportation of an unknown coherent state @xmath186 this result applies to the case of symmetric probing , and with optimum use of squeezed probing light the fidelity gets as high as @xmath187 approaching the classical limit of @xmath188  @xcite when the whole light field is lost .",
    "the entangled state obtained from the asymmetric probing can also be applied in the braunstein - kimble teleportation protocol , in which case the fidelity is expressed in terms of the variances of the non - local variables of the entangled channel @xmath189 and @xmath190 : @xmath191 the theory in sec .  [",
    "sec : asymmetric ] provides the values @xmath192 , @xmath193 with @xmath194 and @xmath195 , and instead of applying the protocol directly we suggest to locally anti - squeeze the @xmath3 s , and hence @xmath196 , and squeeze the @xmath2 s , and hence @xmath197 , so that @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "the maximum value of ( [ f - channel1 ] ) is obtained for @xmath200 , @xmath201 this expression is always less than or equal to @xmath202 , the optimum in the case of symmetric probing with squeezed light , and equality is obtained for probing with squeezed / anti - squeezed light with a finite squeezing factor , @xmath203 , which is incidentally also the optimal optical squeezing in the case of symmetric probing . for large @xmath5 , e.g. , @xmath204 , this value of @xmath46 does indeed lead to significant entanglement , cf .",
    "fig.4 , but the teleportation fidelity behaves `` normally '' and approaches the classical value of @xmath205 when @xmath206 . the surprisingly high entanglement does not provide a scheme for high fidelity teleportation !    we note that we have not really proven that we made optimum use of the entangled state by the straightforward use of the braunstein - kimble protocol , but we can give an independent argument for why ( [ eq : fopt ] ) must be the optimum teleportation fidelity in the case of the asymmetric probing scheme : imagine a modified physical setup where the transmission line and the second gas of our analysis is replaced by a loss less beam splitter arrangement and @xmath207 separate gases , which each receive a fraction @xmath208 of the field after transmission through the first gas .",
    "any one of these gases will become entangled with the first gas as described by the above theory , if we identify the transmitted fraction @xmath82 with @xmath208 .",
    "the teleportation of an unknown coherent state is accomplished by performing a joint measurement on the incident state and the first gas , and communicating the outcome to the other site , where a local operation on the quantum system establishes the output state .",
    "since we share the entangled state with @xmath207 different sites , we are thus able to teleport the same state to @xmath207 different sites , i.e. , produce @xmath207 approximate clones of the incoming state .",
    "the fidelity for each of these clones , however , has been shown by a different argument to be limited by the value @xmath209",
    "@xcite , which therefore must also be the upper limit of our teleportation fidelity .",
    "in conclusion , without violating fundamental results on the achievements of distillation , purification and cloning of gaussian states , we have identified a protocol , that leads to finite entanglement between systems which are coupled by even very lossy transmission lines . if the probing field is split and distributed evenly between a number of partners , our analysis identifies instead a new kind of `` entanglement polygamy '' , where a single system can share finite entanglement with an unlimited number of other systems . unlike a recent proposals for multi - partite gaussian ghz - type states  @xcite , where the entanglement can be concentrated and used for high - fidelity teleportation between any pair by measurements on all the other systems , our entanglement is already sizable , but not correspondingly useful for teleportation .",
    "the logarithmic negativity has been criticized for not always giving a reliable characterization of the entanglement of quantum systems . in our case , however , we have observed that also the more involved gaussian entanglement of formation  @xcite is finite for large losses . rather than demonstrating a weakness of specific entanglement measures",
