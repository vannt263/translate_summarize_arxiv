    "in the late phase of stellar evolution the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star takes place in which a huge amount of energy is released over a period of few tens of seconds .",
    "the energy carriers are mainly neutrinos and thus called supernova neutrinos .",
    "this constitutes almost equal proportion of all the flavor of neutrinos . the average energy for @xmath1 : @xmath2 = 12 mev , @xmath3:@xmath4 = 15 mev and for all other flavors @xmath5,@xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 : @xmath9= 25 mev .",
    "it is expected that these neutrinos may provide valuable information about the stellar core , its equation of state and the dynamics of core collapse and supernova explosion mechanism .",
    "these neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can be detected in terrestrial detectors .",
    "there are presently various detectors like super - k , miniboone , icecube which are capable of detecting supernova neutrinos .",
    "the various detectors@xcite like halo , icarus , lbne lar , lbne wc , memphys , hyper - k , lena , glacier are planned in future which will also be sensitive to supernova neutrino detection .",
    "most of these detectors are using nuclear targets like @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we have calculated event rates for neutral current neutrino induced process @xmath12 for the reaction taking place in the @xmath0 target .",
    "these events are presented for 1kt of target material .",
    "when the above process takes place inside the nucleus various nuclear medium effects comes into play .",
    "we have calculated the cross section in the fermi gas model using the local density approximation and took into account pauli blocking , fermi motion , renormalization of the weak transition strength in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "the effects of fermi motion and pauli blocking are taking into account through the imaginary part of the lindhard function for the particle hole excitations in the nuclear medium .",
    "the renormalization of the weak transition strengths are calculated in the random phase approximation(rpa ) through the interaction of the p - h excitations as they propagate in the nuclear medium using a nucleon - nucleon potential described by pion and rho exchanges .",
    "the expression of total scattering cross section in the local density approximation inside the nucleus is given by  @xcite @xmath13 here @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the leptonic tensor = @xmath16 where the leptonic current @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the hadronic tensor = @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hadronic current given by @xmath21u(p)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the vector , axial and pseudoscalar form factors , respectively .",
    "these form factors are in turn defined in terms of the standard dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon @xmath25 and @xmath26 and a strange component @xmath27 , in the following way @xmath28 where @xmath29 as the weak mixing angle .    for simplicity",
    "we have taken @xmath30=0 in our calculation .",
    "axial form factors @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33(=1.1gev ) is axial dipole mass , @xmath34 denotes the strange contribution to the nucleon spin taken as @xmath34 = -0.15 .",
    "the expression for the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are taken from the ref.@xcite .",
    "the consideration of renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium leads to modified hadronic tensor @xmath39 , the expression for which is given in ref .",
    "in fig.1 , we have presented the results for the scattering cross section @xmath40 as a function of neutrino and antineutrino energies , for the free case as well as in @xmath0 target obtained using the local density approximation(lda ) with and without the random phase approximation(rpa ) correlations .",
    "we find that the inclusion of pauli blocking & fermi motion effects reduces the cross section from the free case which is around 90@xmath41 at e@xmath42 = 10 - 20 mev , 82@xmath41 at e@xmath42 = 50 mev & 65@xmath41 at e@xmath42 = 100 mev .",
    "the cross section further reduces by about 60 - 65@xmath41 in the energy range 10 - 100 mev when rpa effects are taken into account .",
    "the reduction in the case of antineutrino is a bit larger .",
    "the event rates are calculated using the numerical value for the flux averaged cross section @xmath44 where @xmath43 is the cross section shown in fig.1 , @xmath45 is the supernova neutrino flux taken from refs.@xcite .",
    "for the 1 kt target and time taken to be 1 second , the event rates are obtained and have been shown in table 1 .",
    "we find that with the inclusion of rpa correlations the event rate reduces by about 65@xmath41 .",
    "besides the nuclear medium effects the uncertainity in event rates is also due to the flux given by various groups . the use of different fluxes@xcite effect the event rates a lot",
