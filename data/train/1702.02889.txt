    "a common example is the population of a single species whose members are differentiated by their age group , where , e.g. @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent , respectively the population densities of adults and juveniles in time period @xmath0 . in this",

    "the time dependent parameters @xmath11 may be periodic in the presence of periodic factors such as seasonal variations in the environment , migration , harvesting , predation , etc .",

    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) indicates that the juvenile density in each period is adversely affected by adults present in the same period .",
    "causes include competition with adults for scarce resources like food or in some cases , cannibalization of juveniles by adults .",
    "the system ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) is not in the standard form that can be represented by a planar map .",
    "its standard form is obtained by substituting @xmath13 from ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath14 in ( [ 2 ] ) and rearranging terms to obtain the standard planar system@xmath15    in this form , the system is a special case of the age - structured model    [ c]@xmath16 introduced in @xcite . in this general case ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are population densities of adults and juveniles respectively , remaining after @xmath19 periods .",
    "the function @xmath20 is exponential in ( [ 2b ] ) but other choices may be considered for modeling different types of population dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the allee effect describes the positive correlation between population density and its per capita birth rate .",
    "the greater the size of the population , the better it fares .",
    "the increase in the overall fitness of the population at greater densities is attributed to cooperation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the allee principle was first introduced by w. allee ( @xcite , @xcite ) at the time when the prevailing focus was on the effects of overcrowding and competition on the survival of the species .",
    "the allee principle focuses on how low population density , or under - crowding , affects the survival or extinction of the species .",
    "a distinction is made between the weak and strong allee effects .",
    "the effect is weak if per capita population growth is low but positive at lower densities compared to that at higher densities . in the presence of the strong allee effect , population rate below a critical threshold",
    "is negative ( @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , the map that defines the dynamical system that exhibits a strong allee effect is characterized by three fixed points - the extinction or zero fixed point ; a small positive fixed point referred to as the allee threshold ; and a bigger positive fixed point called the carrying capacity ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the population size is at or above the allee threshold , growth in population density is observed , whereas beneath the threshold , population density declines . when the population size is at or above the allee threshold , per capita growth in the population is positive , whereas beneath the threshold , population density declines . for more details on the allee effect and",

    "we study the system in ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) by first folding it into the second - order scalar equation ( [ 3 ] ) below .",
    "the strong allee effect is exhibited when @xmath21 , as might be expected .",
    "however , when @xmath12 the details of the allee effect such as the nature of the extinction region and its boundary are not fully understood in the case of ( [ 3 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "in the autonomous case the extinction region is smaller than expected if @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we establish this fact for a special case of ( [ 3 ] ) and also obtain general conditions for the convergence of solutions of ( [ 3 ] ) to zero when @xmath21 and @xmath22    the main results of this paper are as follows : theorem [ bc0 ] and its immediate corollary state that when @xmath21 extinction occurs for all values of the system parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 if the initial values @xmath26 are suitably restricted .",
    "alternatively , extinction occurs for _ all _ non - negative initial values if the system parameters are sufficiently restricted .",
    "while these results are in line with what is known in the literature about ricker - type systems , lemma [ eoz ] and theorem [ nfpa ] and their immediate corollaries contain results that are not as predictable .",
    "they establish for the case @xmath27 for all @xmath0 ( e.g. a semelparous species ) that the population may become extinct or alternatively , its size may oscillate depending on whether orbits enter , or avoid certain regions of the positive quadrant .",
    "in particular , we find that if the interaction parameter @xmath23 is positive then survival may occur for open regions of the parameter space even if the system contains no positive fixed points ; this is rather unexpected ( and false if @xmath28 ) .",
    "the standard planar form ( [ 1b])-([2b ] ) has additional time - dependent parameters in the exponential function ( [ 2b ] ) that did not exist in the original system .",
    "for this reason and others seen below , we find it more convenient to study ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) using the alternative folding method discussed in @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) may be folded into a scalar second - order difference equation by first solving ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath8 to obtain :    @xmath29    next , back - shifting the indices in ( [ 2 ] ) and substituting the result in ( [ 1 ] ) yields@xmath30 or equivalently,@xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
