    "exploring the properties of nuclei with unusual proton to neutron ratios is nowadays one of the major tasks and most active topics in nuclear structure physics , both theoretical and experimentally @xcite . in this context , the beta - decay properties of these exotic objects are of extreme importance in two different aspects .",
    "first , most nuclei of astrophysical interest @xcite are those far from stability and their beta - decay rates have to be estimated theoretically .",
    "second , beta - decay properties and nuclear structure are intimately related .",
    "it is clear that a precise and reliable description of the ground state of the parent nucleus and of the states populated in the daughter nucleus is necessary to obtain a good description of the @xmath3strength distribution , and vice versa , failures to describe such distributions would indicate that an improvement of the theoretical formalism is needed .",
    "microscopic models to describe the @xmath4-strength based on spherical single - particle wave functions and energies with pairing and residual interactions treated in random phase approximation ( rpa ) or quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) were first studied in ref .",
    "extensions of these models to deal with deformed nuclei were done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a nilsson potential was used to generate single - particle orbitals .",
    "subsequent extensions including woods - saxon type potentials @xcite , residual interactions in the particle - particle channel @xcite , consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field with residual interactions treated in tamm dancoff approximation @xcite , selfconsistent approaches in spherical neutron - rich nuclei @xcite and based on an energy - density functional @xcite , can be also found in the literature .    in a previous work @xcite we studied ground state and @xmath4-decay properties of exotic nuclei on the basis of a deformed selfconsistent hf+bcs+qrpa calculation with density dependent effective interactions of skyrme type .",
    "this is a well founded approach that has been very successful in the description of spherical and deformed nuclei within the valley of stability @xcite . in this method",
    "once the parameters of the effective skyrme interaction are determined , basically by fits to global properties in spherical nuclei over the nuclear chart , and the gap parameters of the pairing force are specified , there are no free parameters left . both the residual interaction and the mean field",
    "are consistently obtained from the same 2-body force .",
    "this is therefore a reliable method , suitable for extrapolations into the unstable regions approaching the drip lines .",
    "it is worth investigating whether these powerful tools designed to account for the properties of stable nuclei are still valid when approaching the drip lines .",
    "the residual interaction introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , consistent with the mean field , acts in the particle - hole channel ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) that for a complete description of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 strengths , the inclusion of the particle - particle ( @xmath8 ) residual interaction is required .",
    "we gave in @xcite an example of the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of such a force but a complete calculation within our formalism including this force is still missing .",
    "one of the purposes of this work is to extend our previous calculations by including a residual separable force in the @xmath8 channel and to study its effect in a systematic way to distinguish what is general and what is particular in the behavior of the nuclear response . to this end",
    "we include in the qrpa calculation a separable neutron - proton pairing force as part of the residual interaction .",
    "following the same criteria as in our previous work @xcite , we apply this formalism to the study of a series of proton rich isotopes approaching @xmath9 in the mass region @xmath10 .",
    "there are several reasons why this is a region of special interest to study @xmath4-decay .",
    "one is that the @xmath11-value of the decay ( @xmath12 ) is quite large in proton rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "this means that a large fraction of the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength is contained within the @xmath12 window .",
    "therefore , one can investigate directly the structure of the gt strength distribution by @xmath4-decay measurements without dealing with other indirect methods to extract the gt strength such as @xmath13 or @xmath14 charge exchange reactions .",
    "another aspect to stress is that the mass region @xmath15 is at the border or beyond the scope of the full shell model calculations .",
    "predictions for the strength distributions , half - lives , and other decay properties obtained from the present formalism are of special relevance in this mass region since they may be at the moment the most reliable calculations .",
    "the present results can then be used as a guidance to further experimental searches .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that this mass region is known to present particular structure effects , such as shape coexistence , which are the result of a delicate balance of competing nuclear shapes @xcite .",
    "it is then important to explore whether the dependence of the beta - decay properties on the deformation of the parent nucleus could be used as an additional piece of information to elucidate the shape of the nucleus . as a last point",
    ", we mention that , by approaching systematically the @xmath9 isotopes in various isotopic chains , we are placed in optimum conditions to observe whether agreement with experiment breaks down at some point as we approach @xmath9 .",
    "these isotopic chains are a laboratory to test the validity of our formalism and to look for failures related to the appearance of new physics such as neutron - proton pairing correlations not taken into account explicitly in the present mean field calculations , that may be important in @xmath9 nuclei . in this work",
    "we extend the study of refs .",
    "@xcite by including a residual neutron - proton pairing interaction in the @xmath16 channel , by studying the influence of usual bcs pairing correlations in the @xmath9 isotopes , and by discussing the similarities between the gt strength distributions and the spin @xmath2 strength distributions , which are the @xmath17 isospin counterparts of the @xmath18 gt transitions .    in section 2",
    ", we present a brief summary containing the basic points in our theoretical description .",
    "section 3 contains the results obtained for the gt strength distributions with a discussion of the dependence on the residual interaction , pairing correlations , and deformation .",
    "we also compare our results to the experimental available information .",
    "spin @xmath2 strength distributions are studied in section 4 discussing their analogies with the gt strength distributions .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in this section we summarize briefly the theory involved in the microscopic calculations presented in the next sections . more details can be found in refs .",
    "our method consists in a selfconsistent formalism based on a deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with a skyrme interaction including pairing correlations in the bcs approximation .",
    "we consider in this paper the force sg2 @xcite of van giai and sagawa , that has been successfully tested against spin and isospin excitations in spherical @xcite and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "comparison to calculations obtained with other skyrme forces have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite , showing that the results do not differ in a significant way .",
    "the single particle energies , wave functions , and occupations probabilities are generated from this mean field .",
    "for the solution of the hf equations we follow the mcmaster procedure that is based in the formalism developed in ref.@xcite as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "time reversal and axial symmetry are assumed .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we use eleven major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in the bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons @xmath19 and neutrons @xmath20 , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences through a symmetric five term formula involving the experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "the values used in this work are the same as those given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we analyzed the energy surfaces as a function of deformation for all the isotopes under study here .",
    "for that purpose , we performed constrained hf calculations with a quadrupole constraint @xcite and we minimized the hf energy under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations in this paper are performed for the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which we obtained minima in the energy surfaces .",
    "most of these nuclei present oblate and prolate equilibrium shapes @xcite that are very close in energy .",
    "we add to the mean field a spin - isospin residual interaction , which is expected to be the most important residual interaction to describe gt transitions .",
    "this interaction contains two parts .",
    "the particle - hole part is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and is derived selfconsistently from the same energy density functional ( and skyrme interaction ) as the hf equation , in terms of the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities @xcite .",
    "the residual interaction is finally written in a separable form by averaging the landau - migdal resulting force over the nuclear volume ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 the coupling strength is given by @xcite    @xmath23    and it is completely determined by the skyrme parameters @xmath24 , the nuclear radius @xmath25 , and the fermi momentum @xmath26 , obtained with the same skyrme force for the given nucleus .    the particle - particle part is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath16 coupling channel .",
    "we introduce this interaction in the usual way @xcite , that is , in terms of a separable force with a coupling constant @xmath27 , which is fitted to the phenomenology ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29    the two forces @xmath5 and @xmath8 in eqs .",
    "( [ vph ] ) and ( [ vpp ] ) are defined with a positive and a negative sign , respectively , according to their repulsive and attractive character , so that the coupling strengths @xmath30 and @xmath31 take positive values .",
    "the peak of the gt resonance is almost insensitive to the @xmath8 force and @xmath27 is usually adjusted to reproduce the half - lives @xcite .",
    "however , one should be careful with the choice of this coupling constant . since the @xmath8 force is introduced independently of the mean field",
    ", if @xmath27 is strong enough it may happen that the qrpa collapses , because the condition that the ground state be stable against the corresponding mode is not fulfilled .",
    "this happens because the @xmath8 force , being an attractive force , makes the gt strength to be pushed down to lower energies with increasing values of @xmath27 .",
    "a careful search of the optimal strength can certainly be done for each particular case , but this is not our purpose here .",
    "instead , we have chosen the same coupling constant for all nuclei considered here .",
    "this value has been obtained under the requirements of improving in general the agreement with the experimental half - lives while being still far from the values leading to the collapse .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the next section .    the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) phonon operator for gt excitations in even - even nuclei is written as    @xmath32\\ , ,   \\label{phon}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 are quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath34 are the excitation energies , and @xmath35 the forward and backward amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion are solved in the proton - neutron qrpa .    from the qrpa equations",
    "the forward and backward amplitudes are obtained as @xcite @xmath36 \\ , ,    \\label{xwa}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 \\ , , \\label{ywa}\\ ] ]    with @xmath38 the two - quasiparticle excitation energy in terms of the quasiparticle energies @xmath39 .",

    "the bulk properties of the isotope chains considered here were already studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "binding energies , charge radii , quadrupole moments , and moments of inertia were discussed and compared successfully to available experimental data . here",
    "we will concentrate on the decay properties .    in this section",
    "we discuss the results obtained for the gt strength distributions , half - lives , and summed strengths in the proton rich isotopes belonging to the @xmath15 mass region .",
    "the results correspond to qrpa calculations with the skyrme force sg2 and they have been performed for the nuclear shapes that minimize the hf energy .    figures showing the gt strength distributions are plotted versus the excitation energy of daughter nucleus .",
    "the distributions of the gt strength have been folded with @xmath57 mev width gaussians to facilitate the comparison among the various calculations , so that the original discrete spectrum is transformed into a continuous profile .",
    "these distributions are given in units of @xmath58 and one should keep in mind that a quenching of the @xmath59 factor , typically @xmath60 is expected on the basis of the observed quenching in charge exchange reactions and spin @xmath2 transitions in stable nuclei , where @xmath61 is also known to be approximately @xmath62 . therefore , a reduction factor of about two is expected in these strength distributions in order to compare with experiment .",
    "this factor is of course taken into account when comparing to experimental half - lives .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the effect of the residual interactions on the uncorrelated 2-quasiparticle calculation .",
    "the calculations are done for the oblate and prolate shapes of @xmath63kr",
    ". the coupling strength of the @xmath5 residual interaction @xmath64 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ chiph ] ) , and its value for @xmath65 and skyrme force sg2 is @xmath66 mev .",
    "the coupling strength of the @xmath8 residual interaction is varied from @xmath67 to @xmath68 mev .",
    "if we compare first the calculation with only the @xmath5 residual interaction ( dotted line ) to the uncorrelated one ( thin solid line ) , we can see that the repulsive @xmath5 force introduces two types of effects .",
    "one is a shift of the gt strength to higher excitation energies with the corresponding displacement of the position of the gt resonance .",
    "the other is a reduction of the total gt strength",
    ". obviously these effects are more pronounced as we increase the value of the coupling strength @xmath64 .",
    "if we now introduce a @xmath8 residual interaction ( dashed and solid lines ) , we can see that its effect , being an attractive force , is to shift the strength to lower excitation energies , reducing the total gt strength as well .",
    "the shift and reduction of strength is more pronounced at high excitation energies and the position of the gt resonance is hardly affected by this interaction .",
    "the gt strength is also pushed a bit by the @xmath8 interaction to lower energies in the low energy excitation region .",
    "this effect , although small , is of great relevance in the calculation of the @xmath69 half - lives , which are only sensitive to the distribution of the strength contained in the energy region below the @xmath12 window . by comparing the curves obtained from @xmath70 mev ( dashed line ) and @xmath68 mev ( solid line )",
    ", we can also see how these effects are more pronounced as we increase the value of the coupling strength .",
    "this is the reason why the usual procedure to fit these two coupling strengths @xmath64 and @xmath27 is as follows : first one chooses @xmath64 to reproduce the position of the gt resonance , usually determined from charge exchange reactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and then one chooses @xmath27 to reproduce the half - life . in our work , since the value of @xmath64 is determined selfconsistently and the known gt resonances are reasonably well described @xcite , we do not carry out this case by case fitting procedure .",
    "however , to determine the value of @xmath27 , we calculate first gt strength distributions and half - lives and compare the latter with experiment to extract a value that producing a reasonable agreement is still within the range of values compatible with the correct treatment of the qrpa .",
    "in figure 2 we can see the result of the calculation of the half - lives in @xmath71sr as a function of the coupling strength @xmath27 .",
    "the half - lives are obtained from the familiar expression ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 are the fermi integrals .",
    "note that in our previous work @xcite , we used for these integrals the values tabulated in @xcite . in the present calculations we compute the fermi integrals numerically for each @xmath74 values . by this procedure",
    "we get more accurate results .",
    "we use @xmath75 s and include standard effective factors    @xmath76 ^{2}=\\left [ 0.77\\left ( g_{a}/g_{v}\\right ) _ { free}\\right ]",
    "^{2}=0.90 \\ , . \\label{quen}\\ ] ]    the half - life decreases with increasing values of @xmath27 .",
    "this is clear because as @xmath27 increases the strength becomes more concentrated at low excitation energies below @xmath12 and therefore the half - lives are smaller .",
    "this is true up to values around @xmath77 mev , where the collapse of the qrpa takes place . in the case of @xmath71sr , we get an optimum value of @xmath78 mev and @xmath79 mev for the oblate and prolate shapes , respectively",
    ". this value will of course depend , among other factors , on the nucleus , shape , and skyrme interaction and a case by case fitting procedure could be carried out .",
    "nevertheless , we have done calculations for other cases and found that , in general , values around @xmath80 mev improve the agreement with experiment in most cases and since this is a valid value far from collapse , we have chosen @xmath80 mev as the value of the coupling constant of the @xmath8 residual interaction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite homma and collaborators studied @xmath3decay properties using nilsson+bcs+qrpa with @xmath5 and @xmath8 separable residual interactions .",
    "they considered a wide range of nuclei to extract phenomenologically the coupling strength of such residual interactions by fits to experimental half - lives .",
    "they obtained the following dependence on the mass number : @xmath81 mev , @xmath82 mev . for @xmath10",
    "this gives a @xmath5 strength @xmath83 mev and a @xmath8 strength @xmath78 mev .",
    "the @xmath5 strength is somewhat smaller than the one obtained from eq .",
    "( [ chiph ] ) , derived selfconsistently from our mean field .",
    "the @xmath8 strength is also smaller than the value adopted here .",
    "this is consistent with the trend observed in fig . 1 of homma _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that shows that for decreasing values of @xmath64 one needs smaller values of @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "a discussion of the adequacy of our @xmath5 strength is also demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we compared our results on the position of the gt resonance with experimental data from @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions in this mass region .",
    "the fact that our @xmath5 and @xmath8 strengths are somewhat different from those in ref .",
    "@xcite is not surprising since the mean fields are also different .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , our theoretical treatment does not explicitly include neutron - proton pairing correlations in the mean field .",
    "thus , our quasiparticle basis only includes neutron - neutron and proton - proton pairing correlations in the bcs approach . in principle",
    ", one could extend the bcs treatment to include also neutron - proton pairing correlations in the mean field .",
    "this may be important particularly for n = z nuclei .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied bulk properties ( binding energies , charge radii , quadrupole moments , moments of inertia , ... ) of the nuclei considered here and found that the agreement between theory and experiment is as good for the @xmath9 as for the @xmath84 isotopes .",
    "we concluded that the effect of neutron - proton pairing correlations on these bulk properties is roughly taken into account by the use of the phenomenological gap parameters @xmath85    the main effect of taking into account neutron - proton pairing in the hf+bcs calculation would be to increase the diffuseness of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "this diffuseness is proportional to the gap parameters .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the sensitivity of the gt strength to the gap parameters in the @xmath9 nuclei @xmath86ge , @xmath87se , @xmath88kr , and @xmath71sr . to this end",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "3 the qrpa results obtained with the sg2 force in those nuclei for various values of the gap parameters differing by @xmath89 mev from the values extracted from the phenomenology . to make the discussion easier we did not include the @xmath8 residual interaction in those figures .    the main effect of the bcs correlations is to create new transitions that were forbidden in the absence of such correlations . since the occupation probabilities are now different from 0 or 1 , the already existing peaks at @xmath90 will decrease when @xmath91 , while new strength will appear at other energies and will increase with increasing gap parameters .",
    "this new strength is in general located at high excitation energy , while the strength already present at @xmath90 is mainly concentrated at lower energy . as a consequence , the main effect of increasing the fermi diffuseness is to smooth out the profile of the gt strength distribution , increasing the strength at high energies and decreasing the strength at low energies .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that each particular case has its own peculiarities but the general trend described above plays the major role .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that in the high energy tail beyond the gt resonance , the effects of increasing @xmath92 and increasing @xmath27 are opposite . as we mentioned before ,",
    "increasing @xmath27 tends to deplete those tails .",
    "the role of deformation on the gt strength distributions can be summarized , in general , in two types of effects .",
    "first , deformation breaks down the degeneracy of the spherical shells and this implies that the gt strength distributions corresponding to deformed nuclear shapes will be much more fragmented than the corresponding spherical ones .",
    "second , the energy levels of deformed orbitals coming from different spherical shells cross each other in a way that depends on the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation as well as on the oblate or prolate character .",
    "this level crossing may lead in some instances to similar profiles in the gt strength distributions of the various coexisting nuclear shapes but in other cases it may lead to sizeable differences between the gt strength distributions corresponding to different shapes of the same parent nucleus .",
    "this fact can be exploited to gain information on what is the nuclear shape of a nucleus by just looking at the structure of its @xmath4-decay .",
    "4 summarizes the main results of this work .",
    "they correspond to the gt strength distributions obtained from our hf+bcs+qrpa with sg2 in the isotope chains of ge , se , kr , and sr .",
    "we can see in this figure the results obtained for the possible nuclear shapes of the isotopes ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath93 . as usual the strengths are in units of @xmath58 and are plotted versus the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus .",
    "we can see that in general the @xmath9 isotopes of each chain contain the maximum strength as it corresponds to the most unstable nuclei .",
    "this strength becomes smaller and smaller as we increase the number of neutrons approaching the stable isotopes .",
    "the excitation energy of the gt resonance also decreases with the number of neutrons .    if we look in fig .",
    "3 the case of ge and se isotopes , we can see that there are no signatures of the actual character , oblate or prolate , of the deformation of the parent nucleus : both equilibrium shapes produce similar gt profiles independently of whether it is oblate or prolate .",
    "then , it can be concluded that in these isotopes one can not use gt distributions to distinguish between the two coexistent shapes predicted by the theory .",
    "on the other hand , the figures corresponding to kr and sr isotopes , show differences in the gt profiles of the various shapes for each isotope that can be easily identified even within the @xmath12 window .",
    "a case by case analysis allows one to conclude that the most favorable candidates to look for deformation effects based on @xmath4-decay measurements are @xmath63kr and @xmath94sr . in these isotopes",
    "the gt strengths within the @xmath12 window are different enough to distinguish between different equilibrium shapes . on the contrary , there are cases like @xmath88kr where though the large @xmath12 value ( @xmath95 mev ) make it worth to investigate experimentally , the measured strength may not be conclusive on the shape because oblate and prolate shapes produce similar profiles .",
    "other isotopes like @xmath96kr have small @xmath12 values that will not allow a clear conclusion either , while @xmath63kr seems to be the best kr candidate .",
    "it has a @xmath12 window ( 3.1 mev ) big enough to distinguish between a continuously increasing profile , as the prolate shape predicts , or a completely developed bump structure peaked at around 1.5 mev and vanishing at about the @xmath12 value , as the oblate shape predicts .",
    "a similar situation happens in the case of @xmath71sr ( @xmath97 mev ) .",
    "the oblate shape produces a peak centered at around 1 mev and a second one centered at 6 mev , while the prolate shape produces a gt distribution that increases almost continuously up to 6 mev .",
    "the case of @xmath98sr ( @xmath99 mev ) is again a clear case where one can distinguish between the bump structure generated by the spherical shape or the continuously increasing pattern of the prolate case .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath100sr isotope , although in this case @xmath12 is not so big ( @xmath101 mev ) .      in this subsection",
    "we compare to experiment our calculated @xmath12 and total @xmath102 half - lives @xmath103 , as well as a few cases where the gt strength distribution have been partially measured by @xmath104-decay .",
    "we also discuss the gt strengths contained within the @xmath12 windows .",
    "the difference with respect to the values quoted in our previous work @xcite is that now the @xmath8 interaction is included .",
    "there is also a minor difference in the calculation of @xmath12 , @xmath105 the @xmath12 values in tables 1 - 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite were calculated approximating the lowest quasiparticle energies @xmath106 and @xmath107 by the gap parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , while @xmath12 values in table 1 here are calculated using their actual values @xmath110 .",
    "we can see in table 1 these results obtained from qrpa calculations with the skyrme force sg2 and for the different shapes , oblate , prolate or spherical , where the minima occur for each isotope .",
    "we did not include the stable nuclei , all having @xmath12 less than zero and infinite half - lives .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the total gt strength below @xmath12 has been reduced by a quenching factor 0.6 to be consistent with the same quenching used in the calculation of the half - lives in eq .",
    "( [ t12 ] ) .",
    "we get a very good agreement with the measured @xmath12 values in practically all cases and the values obtained with the various shapes are quite similar .",
    "the half - lives are also well reproduced in most cases . only in the most stable isotopes , where the half - lives are very large , we find some noticeable discrepancies but this is not so relevant because in these cases the @xmath12 values are very small and therefore , the half - lives are only sensitive to a tiny region of the gt tail at low energies . in other cases",
    "the agreement is very reasonable .",
    "the sums of the gt strength up to the @xmath12 value do not differ much from one shape to another although this does not mean that the structure of the profiles are equivalent . as we have seen in the last subsection , there are cases , @xmath63kr and @xmath94sr , whose profiles can be easily distinguished although the final summed strength is very similar",
    ".    table 2 contains experimental information on gt summed strengths in the @xmath9 nuclei @xmath88kr @xcite and @xmath71sr @xcite up to different values of the excitation energy , always below @xmath12 .",
    "they are compared to our theoretical calculations for the two equilibrium shapes using the same quenching factor as in eq .",
    "( [ quen ] ) . from this comparison",
    "an oblate shape for @xmath88kr and a prolate shape for @xmath71sr seems to be favored , but this is not yet sufficient for a conclusive answer .    in any case",
    "it would be worth to extend the measurements in @xmath71sr to higher excitation energies because it is a very good example where deformation effects are visible ( see fig . 4 for @xmath71sr ) .",
    "on the other hand , the extension of these measurements to the case of @xmath88kr may not be so relevant since one could not distinguish one shape from another ( see fig . 4 for @xmath88kr ) .",
    "the spin @xmath2 transitions are the @xmath111 isospin counterparts of the @xmath112 gt transitions .",
    "the study carried out in @xcite for several isotope chains showed that the @xmath2 strength depends on deformation , not only for orbital but also for spin excitations .",
    "thus , on general grounds , one may argue that the deformation dependence of the gt strength discussed earlier should be comparable to that of the spin @xmath2 strength considered in @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be particularly the case when @xmath9 .    in a similar way to fig . 4 for the gt distributions , we show in fig .",
    "5 the profiles of the spin @xmath2 strength distributions for the same isotope chains .",
    "the results correspond to the selfconsistent hf+bcs+qrpa calculations with the sg2 interaction .",
    "the details of these calculations are described in @xcite and closely follow those of the gt strength except for the @xmath111 character of the @xmath2 operator .",
    "similarly to the gt strength distributions in the ge and se isotope chains in fig .",
    "4 , we can see that the @xmath113 strength distributions for these two isotopes in fig .",
    "5 have similar structures for the oblate and prolate shapes .",
    "they have a big resonance located at the same energy around 10 mev and a small bump at about 5 mev .",
    "however , the strength contained in the prolate peak is always larger than the oblate one , contrary to what happened with the gt strengths that were comparable .",
    "the spherical shape in @xmath63se produces much less strength than the deformed shapes .",
    "we can also see in fig . 5 for kr and sr isotopes that the profiles of the @xmath2 strengths corresponding to the prolate and oblate distributions can be clearly distinguished , similarly to the case of the gt distributions in fig .",
    "the strength corresponding to the prolate shape is again the largest .",
    "therefore , clear similarities between the gt and @xmath2 strength distributions are observed , but some differences can be seen as well . in particular , for spin @xmath2 strength distributions the position and strength of the resonance are practically the same in all nuclei in a given isotope chain .",
    "this is different to what happened with the gt strength distributions , where the @xmath114-gt strength decreases very fast with increasing @xmath115 due to pauli blocking , while @xmath2 strengths are not affected by this .",
    "we studied @xmath0-decay in various isotopic chains of medium - mass proton - rich nuclei within the framework of the selfconsistent deformed hf+bcs+qrpa with skyrme interactions .",
    "our spin - isospin residual interaction contains a particle - hole part , which is derived selfconsistently from the skyrme force , and a particle - particle part , which is a separable force representing a neutron - proton pairing force .",
    "compared to previous calculations , where the latter residual interaction was not considered , we obtain in general better agreement with experiment for half - lives .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the n = z isotopes this agreement is comparable to that achieved for the other isotopes with an excess of neutrons .",
    "this indicates that using the phenomenological gap values for neutrons and protons , as well as the neutron - proton pairing correlations as a residual force in qrpa , is sufficient to account at least for this experimental information .    from our study of the dependence on the shape of the gt strength distributions",
    "we conclude that there are some interesting cases that are worth to explore experimentally such as @xmath63kr and @xmath94sr . in these examples",
    "the measured @xmath0 strengths below @xmath12 could be used to identify their equilibrium shapes . in particular ,",
    "we have observed in @xmath71sr various compatible indications pointing out towards the same conclusion : a strong prolate component in the ground state that is suggested from the comparison to experiment of half - lives and gt strength measured at low excitation energies .",
    "nevertheless , more experimental information is still needed to reach a conclusive answer .",
    "we also studied the energy distributions of the spin @xmath2 strength and the similarities and differences with their gt counterparts .",
    "we conclude that the main features of gt and spin @xmath2 strength distributions are similar .",
    "this suggests that we may learn about properties that are observable in highly unstable nuclei ( like @xmath4 decay ) from properties that are observable in stable nuclei ( like @xmath2 s ) , and vice versa .",
    "information on spin @xmath2 excitations can be extracted from both leptonic and hadronic probes . in stable nuclei ,",
    "the combined analysis of electron , photon , and proton scattering data has provided reliable information on orbital and spin @xmath2 strength distributions @xcite . in principle",
    ", the same type of experiments could be performed on the proton rich nuclei considered here .",
    "inelastic @xmath116 scattering experiments might be particularly suitable to explore the spin part of the @xmath2 strength and to test the predictions of the present paper .",
