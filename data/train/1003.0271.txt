    "<S> the non - relativistic approximation of the quark - meson - coupling model has been discussed and compared with the skyrme - hartree - fock model which includes spin exchanges . </S>",

    "<S> also in the quark - meson - coupling model , it is the fock exchange that leads to a nonlinear density - dependent isovector channel and changes the density - dependent behavior of the symmetry energy .    </S>",
