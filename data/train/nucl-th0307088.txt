    "baryon spectroscopy continues to motivate an extensive experimental program , with most studies focused on the missing resonance problem .",
    "while many states predicted by conventional quark models have yet to be seen , other states , such as pentaquarks and hybrids , are also interesting , as they offer potentially new information on the dynamics of confinement . given the underpopulation of conventional 3-quark states , it is difficult to identify these unconventional states . if , however , a state was to be found with a mass between the nucleon and @xmath1 , it would undoubtedly have an exotic structure .",
    "such a baryon state ( called here @xmath0 , for brevity and according to tradition , though its isospin could be 3/2 ) was first suggested   @xcite to complete the unitary multiplet of hyperon resonance states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , considered now to have one - star status ( see pdg listings  @xcite ) . a baryon state in the same mass interval",
    "was later suggested as a ( quasi)bound pion - nucleon state ( see sources in ref .",
    "it appeared possible , even before any specially designed experiments , to obtain bounds for the properties of such a light baryon .",
    "those bounds implied  @xcite that hadronic , and perhaps electromagnetic , couplings of the @xmath0 to usual hadrons should be small ( though not necessarily forbidden ) , thus suggesting a narrow resonance with a small production cross - section . missing mass experiments , as well as @xmath4 interactions and electroproduction ,",
    "were suggested   @xcite as means to search for @xmath0 states .",
    "direct experimental searches for @xmath0 have begun rather recently .",
    "unfortunately , the results have been contradictory .",
    "initially , in the reaction @xmath5 at triumf  @xcite no baryon was detected with @xmath6 and a production cross - section @xmath7 of the backward elastic @xmath8 cross - section ( an additional assumption of a long lifetime was used ) .",
    "however , in the reaction @xmath9 measured at saclay  @xcite several low - mass structures were reported and interpreted as narrow peaks corresponding to new baryons .",
    "this report renewed interest , both theoretical and experimental , in the subject .",
    "if correct , such baryons would have isospin @xmath10 , masses of 1004 , 1044 , and 1094  mev , and widths less than 415  mev .",
    "two of these could decay only radiatively , while for the third ( slightly above the @xmath11-threshold ) the radiative decay channel could also be important .",
    "the existence of these states was opposed in  @xcite , on the basis of their non - observation in the compton scattering on protons or neutrons loosely bound in deuterons .",
    "similar measurements of @xmath12 at inr ( moscow ) gave evidence for structures  @xcite interpreted by the authors as corresponding to light narrow dibaryons ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "simultaneously , narrow structures with @xmath13 were also observed .",
    "these could be kinematically related to the dibaryons or correspond to new narrow baryonic states with masses 966 , 986 , and 1003  mev  @xcite ( the latter state perhaps related to the 1004  mev structure of  @xcite ) .",
    "however , an attempt to study one of these reported dibaryons at rcnp , osaka , in the same reaction , but with stated better mass resolution and better background conditions , showed no statistically significant effect  @xcite , thus possibly casting doubt on both the narrow dibaryons and baryons of  @xcite .",
    "narrow light baryons have been also searched for with good precision at jlab ( hall  a ) and mami in electroproduction reactions @xmath14   @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "no signals were found up to a missing mass of about 1100  mev at the level  @xmath16 with respect to the height of the neutron peak .",
    "the theoretical status of @xmath0 resonances is similarly unclear .",
    "it was noted from the beginning  @xcite that the smallness of @xmath0-couplings to usual hadrons  might be a consequence of the sharp difference in inner quark structure of @xmath17 and @xmath0  \" . since the internal spin - flavor wave function for usual octet and decuplet baryons is totally symmetric , it has been assumed that new narrow baryons have a totally antisymmetric spin - flavor wave function   @xcite .",
    "if so , they should not only have suppressed hadron couplings , but also forbidden one - photon decays .",
    "such a possibility looks attractive and is frequently referred to , since it could reconcile hadron production of @xmath0 states with the absence of @xmath0 signals in compton scattering and electroproduction .",
    "however , ground states ( having @xmath18-wave space structure ) with such spin - flavor properties should be , due to the pauli principle , totally symmetric in color and therefore not colorless .    one explanation of the @xmath0 states hypothesized  @xcite the existence of a new  light pion \" with a mass of about 20  mev .",
    "new baryons were then assumed to be bound states of a usual nucleon with several  light pions \" . however , existence of such  light pions \" has not been confirmed in any way .",
    "another suggestion  @xcite has been to construct new baryons from clusters of diquarks .",
    "the suggested mass formula produces a dense spectrum , able to accomodate all the reported states and many more .",
    "such approaches lie outside the mainstream of hadron physics , and are aimed mainly at a description of the reported mass spectrum of the narrow baryons .",
    "our renewed investigation of the @xmath0 puzzle has been partly motivated by a recent set of measurements , suggesting that unconventional multi - quark systems may indeed exist in nature .",
    "experimental evidence from spring-8 , itep , and jlab measurements   @xcite suggests the existence of an exotic @xmath19-baryon ( former @xmath20 ) . predicted  @xcite on the basis of the chiral soliton model",
    ", it has positive strangeness and , therefore , is exotic , _ i.e. _ , can not consist of only three quarks . if exotic hadrons really do exist , some could have the same quantum numbers as nucleons .",
    "the chiral soliton approach for @xmath19 and its relatives ( members of the same @xmath21-multiplet ) predicts they will have @xmath22 , which requires , for the @xmath23-system , at least one orbital excitation ( @xmath24-wave ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect the existence of lower - lying nucleon and other baryon states .",
    "we will return to this suggestion later on .",
    "our presentation proceeds as follows . in section  [ sec : bound ] , we first consider various new restrictions for the existence of @xmath0 states , separately below and above the @xmath11-threshold , and discuss how they are related .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nature ] , we discuss the possibility of @xmath0 being a candidate for a 5-quark system .",
    "we also give a tentative description of the unitary partners of @xmath0 .",
    "the whole picture is briefly summarized in the conclusion .",
    "having controversial results from dedicated experiments searching for the @xmath0 , we first study what limitations can be obtained at present from other considerations .",
    "this will allow us to check for consistency in the present status of possible light nucleon resonances .",
    "it is convenient , at this point , to consider separately the cases of @xmath0 states above or below the @xmath11-threshold .      if we assume that the new state @xmath0 exists above the elastic @xmath25-threshold , but below the @xmath26 , it is then natural to expect that @xmath0 decays only ( or , at least , mainly ) to @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", one might expect a partial wave analysis to easily reveal the presence or absence of such a resonance .",
    "this is , however , not quite so .",
    "there are two kinds of partial - wave analyses ( pwa ) : single - energy ( se ) , when a pwa is made independently in narrow energy bins ; and energy - dependent ( ed ) , which uses an energy - dependent parametrization to consider simultaneously data at various energies . in the se treatment",
    ", one can miss a resonance which is narrow enough to fall into the gap between two neighboring energy bins .",
    "the ed consideration assumes a mild energy dependence , and may smear a narrow resonance peak down to ( nearly ) zero .",
    "consequently , we must use another approach to search for narrow elastic resonances .",
    "we have used the @xmath11 said database , which is the basis for se and ed pwa s  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a resonance was then assumed in a particular partial - wave amplitude ( _ i.e. _ , with fixed quantum numbers ) , having fixed values of mass and width . with this addition",
    ", we have readjusted all other fitting parameters to minimize @xmath27 .",
    "if a resonance is actually present , we expect that the fit should improve ( lowering @xmath27 ) once it is included .",
    "we applied this procedure for pion laboratory energies below 500  mev , adding resonances to all @xmath18-waves , all @xmath24-waves , and two @xmath28-waves : @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "other partial - wave amplitudes are very small in the considered energy interval and can be neglected . for trial masses ,",
    "we use values from 1100  mev up to 1300  mev ( formally , we enter the inelastic region , but the inelasticity is very small ) . for widths ,",
    "we take 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , and 300  kev ( additional resonances with higher widths are definitely excluded ) .",
    "surveying our results , we found a case where it was possible to diminish @xmath27 .",
    "this could be done by inserting a resonance with a mass of 1225  mev and a width of 50  kev into the wave @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g1 ] ) .",
    "the change of @xmath27 reaches @xmath32 , while @xmath27 itself is about 6000 . to reveal the nature of this effect",
    ", we note that the `` suspected '' mass value appears very near the @xmath33-threshold which is 1220  mev .",
    "this threshold is accounted for in the parametrization of partial - wave amplitudes , but not exactly .",
    "insertion of a narrow `` resonance '' imitates small corrections to the threshold description .",
    "such an interpretation is supported by the fact that @xmath34 as a function of the trial resonance mass has the local minima near 1220  mev for any  resonating \" partial wave and for any assumed  resonance \" width ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] ) .",
    "one more interesting effect emerges in the wave @xmath35 for the resonance width @xmath36  kev .",
    "this generates a sharp minimum for @xmath34 at the assumed resonance mass 1145  mev ( which corresponds to a pion kinetic energy of 79.5  mev in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "though @xmath34 stays positive here , it takes a very small value , about 9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g3 ] ) .",
    "no threshold is present at this mass , and to clarify the case , we have examined the experimental data in this region .",
    "it appears that there is a gap in data , which could be `` filled '' by a narrow resonance ( with a width smaller than 50  kev ) .",
    "its presence would dramatically change cross - sections and polarization effects of @xmath11 interactions in the resonance region as compared to the present non - resonant expectations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g4 ] ) but would have practically no effect on the existing data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g5 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , this gap in data also allows local minima of @xmath34 near 1145  mev for any partial wave and for each ( small enough ) trial resonance width .",
    "this situation demonstrates the limited sensitivity of existing data to the resonance problem . indeed , sufficiently narrow resonances ( with @xmath37  kev for the present data )",
    "can always be inserted into one or another partial wave providing a better fit , even if a true resonance is absent there .",
    "our considerations allow us to draw some conclusions :    \\1 ) we find no evidence for elastic @xmath11 resonances in the region between the @xmath11-threshold and 1300  mev having a width @xmath38  kev .",
    "\\2 ) the present @xmath11 data can not exclude even purely elastic ( or inelastic ) narrow resonances with widths below 50  kev .",
    "\\3 ) insertion of trial narrow  resonances \" may be a good  technical trick \" to check the quality of fit to a set of experimental data .    to estimate the meaning of the obtained results for additional resonance(s ) ,",
    "let us compare them to the well - known properties of the @xmath26 , having a width of about 120  mev .",
    "thus , we have @xmath39    up to now , we have discussed only the hadronic interactions of @xmath0 .",
    "however , such a narrow resonance could have a significant radiative decay @xmath40 .",
    "if so , it should produce a signal in the compton @xmath4 scattering , proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "absence of the signal in the @xmath42 data up to @xmath43  mev  @xcite allowed the derivation of a limit  @xcite which depends on the assumed mass of @xmath0 . for the whole region @xmath44  mev",
    ", it gives @xmath45 for comparison , @xmath46  kev  @xcite .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0 does exist between the @xmath11-threshold and the @xmath1-region , the compton data require a suppression @xmath47 an order of magnitude weaker than the result of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for total widths .",
    "we next consider @xmath0 states below the @xmath11-threshold .",
    "of course , such states can not decay to @xmath11 and can not be seen as a resonance in @xmath11 scattering",
    ". they may be , nevertheless , coupled to the @xmath25 channel .",
    "then , as was suggested earlier  @xcite , the @xmath11 scattering data may give useful information about the @xmath0 through dispersion relations ( dr ) .",
    "these relations for the @xmath48 amplitude contain a contribution from the neutron pole at the unphysical value @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the squared @xmath11 energy in the center - of - mass frame ) , with a residue proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 amplitude does not contain such a pole , since there are no stable baryons with @xmath53 , but has the neutron pole in the crossed channel , at the unphysical point @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being the squared 4-momentum transfer from proton to @xmath56 , again , in the center - of - mass frame ) .",
    "these properties underlie the use of dr to extract @xmath51 from experimental @xmath11-scattering data ( for a description of the procedure , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the @xmath0 does exist with @xmath57 and couples to the @xmath11 system , it generates an additional pole in the @xmath11 scattering amplitude . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume here that @xmath0 has the same quantum numbers as the nucleon ( @xmath53 is excluded with high precision by the data  @xcite ; spin and/or parity of @xmath0 different from @xmath17 would only provide an additional factor , of order unity , in the residue ) .",
    "the procedure of  @xcite for such a case is really sensitive only to the sum @xmath58 , and can not separate the two terms . therefore , we should rewrite the result based on the use of dr  @xcite as @xmath59    there is , however , an alternative way to extract @xmath51 from the pion exchange contribution to @xmath60 scattering .",
    "this is not spoiled by the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "a consistency requirement of the two methods can help to extract or restrict @xmath61 . in this way , @xmath8-scattering gives  @xcite : @xmath62 thus , @xmath63 should not be more than , say , 0.16 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 note that an earlier bound of this kind was weaker , with a limit of 0.1  @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that the uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) could be larger  @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different method to restrict @xmath61 was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this was based on the adler - weisberger ( aw ) sum rule   @xcite related to the algebra of currents .",
    "in contrast with the dr method , the employed current algebra is not rigorously derived for strong interactions .",
    "it can only be an approximation requiring , in particular , the pion to be massless , without a systematic method for corrections .",
    "specifically for the aw sum rule , adler has discussed possible corrections , estimating the likely error to be about 5%  @xcite .",
    "therefore , methods based on the aw sum rule can not give more reliable bounds than dr , and we do not use them here .    as in the preceding subsection , we continue by considering processes including other interactions , which could be useful in the search for @xmath0 states .",
    "one of these is the capture of stopped pions .",
    "negative pions , being stopped in hydrogen , produce mainly two final states : @xmath65 their relative abundance is described by the panofsky ratio @xmath66 which is about 1.5 .",
    "the pion final state provides the best system for a precise determination of the pion mass difference , through accurate measurements of either the neutron velocity or that of the neutral pion .",
    "the former can be measured by the time of flight ( tof ) , while the latter can be found from @xmath67 angular correlations in the final state @xmath68 that emerges after the @xmath69-decay . the same final state , but with a different angular distribution , appears due to the direct two - photon process @xmath70 ( see diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : g6 ] ) .",
    "an @xmath0 state with mass between @xmath71 and @xmath72 provides one more source for the @xmath68 final state : @xmath73 ( compare diagrams of fig .  [",
    "fig : g7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a detailed investigation of this @xmath74 final state may provide further evidence for , or a restriction on , @xmath0 contributions .",
    "the most precise measurement of the pion mass difference comes today from the tof experiment at psi  @xcite , with a nearly discrete neutron velocity corresponding to the @xmath75 final state .",
    "one more discrete neutron velocity , for the @xmath76 final state , is also seen quite well .",
    "the direct transition to @xmath68 and/or the @xmath77-cascade would produce signals with different properties : they should have continuous velocity distributions .",
    "unfortunately , such signals in the work  @xcite , if they exist , seem to be subtracted together with background .",
    "another approach was used in a triumf measurement  @xcite .",
    "the authors have studied the final @xmath68 system in the kinematical configuration which totally excluded contributions from the @xmath75 final state .",
    "they were thus able to find the signal for direct @xmath68 decay .",
    "assuming theoretically expected energy - angle distributions , the measured branching ratio for @xmath70 was @xmath78\\times10^{-5}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "important for our goal here is the fact that the measured @xmath67 distributions show reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations for the direct @xmath74-decay .",
    "this means that up to statistical and systematic uncertainties ( each about 10% ) there were no contributions of the @xmath77-cascade . keeping in mind the incomplete kinematical coverage and the different energy - angle distributions for direct and cascade decays ( the latter depending also on the spin - parity of @xmath77 )",
    ", we can safely use the measured intensity of the direct decay as an upper bound for the cascade decay .",
    "then , accounting for the panofsky ratio and assuming a 100% branching ratio for @xmath79 , we derive the conservative estimate @xmath80\\ , .   \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the number in square parentheses corresponds to the assumption that contribution of the @xmath0-cascade is smaller than the total experimental uncertainty of the direct decay signal . again , note that earlier data on the @xmath81-capture allowed only a weaker result for this bound , @xmath82  @xcite .    coupling of @xmath0 to the @xmath83 channel should generate a contribution to the compton scattering . since it has not been seen for proton or neutron targets ,",
    "one obtains a mass - dependent bound for the radiative widths  @xcite . for the whole interval from @xmath84 up to the @xmath85-threshold , it is @xmath86 while at the lower end of the interval it can be a fraction of an ev . in terms of dipole moments and their effective lengths",
    "this leads to values which can be 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath87 in the discussed mass region is just the total width @xmath88 if this decay mode is not suppressed somehow .",
    "if , however , the @xmath83 mode is essentially suppressed , it might become comparable to the @xmath89 mode .",
    "let us summarize and compare existing bounds for various quantities describing interactions ( or couplings ) of the @xmath0 with familiar hadrons .",
    "results of both the preceding subsections and other works are compiled in the table  [ tbl1 ] . at first sight",
    ", they can not even be compared to each other , since they concern different kinds of interactions and processes . however , all those bounds are interrelated , at least ,  parametrically \" .    to begin with ,",
    "we consider first the case of an @xmath0 below the @xmath11-threshold .",
    "states with @xmath53 are strongly excluded here by the triumf experiment  @xcite .",
    "keep in mind , however , that this strong bound is applicable only if the double - charged member of the isotopic quartet is very long - lived , having @xmath90  sec ; for shorter lifetimes it becomes weaker .",
    "the bound is about @xmath91 , instead of @xmath92 , for @xmath93  nsec and rapidly weakens for smaller @xmath94 .    for @xmath10",
    ", the most strict limitation in the table  [ tbl1 ] seems to be the bound for @xmath95 compared to @xmath76 .",
    "it is in good correspondence with limits from compton scattering , also strict . indeed , using a suppression factor , say , @xmath96 we can estimate an upper bound for the radiative width of @xmath0 as a function of its mass : @xmath97 for masses 1004 , 1044 , and 1094  mev this gives respectively 0.3 , 1.5 , and 4  ev as upper bounds of @xmath98 , while direct treatment  @xcite of the compton data provides in the same cases 0.2 , 1.6 , and 7  ev .    at first sight",
    ", one can not directly compare estimates from @xmath81-capture to the bound for @xmath99 from dr , because they relate to different kinds of interactions .",
    "however , let us consider the structure of the corresponding amplitudes .",
    "contributions to the radiative capture of the pion come from the diagrams like those of fig .",

    "this illustrates that , if the capture to @xmath102 has no special kinematical suppression ( _ e.g. _ , for @xmath103 very close to @xmath104 ) , then the radiative pion - capture limitation of eq .",

    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "note that dr could provide only the weaker bound of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , because of insufficient precision of the set of @xmath11 and @xmath60 scattering data .",
    "thus , @xmath100 should be not more than @xmath106 . the presence of the non - pion - exchange contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : g7]b , without strong vertex supression , requires the radiative vertex @xmath107 to also be suppressed , in comparison with @xmath108 , at least by the same factor @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , compton data show that in some cases the radiative vertex may be suppressed even stronger by the factor of @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "the situation for the case of @xmath110 looks similar .",
    "we can make the self - consistent assumption that in all cases both strong and electromagnetic couplings of @xmath0 with usual hadrons should be suppressed more strongly than by a factor of @xmath109 in amplitudes .    as a result",
    ", we expect that if the light resonances do exist , their hadro- , photo- and electroproduction can be seen only at a level smaller than @xmath16 with respect to  normal \" cross - sections for usual hadrons .",
    "we also note in passing that for @xmath111 the hadroproduction of @xmath0 could appear as a special contribution to bremsstrahlung , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath112 .",
    "the bounds for @xmath0 properties , discussed above , appear rather severe and may be considered as evidence against the existence of such states . if , nevertheless , there are arguments for their existence , one needs to have an explanation for why couplings to usual hadrons are so suppressed .    in the introduction",
    ", we briefly mentioned a motivation for considering non - standard quark states , based on the recently reported baryon @xmath19  @xcite with clearly exotic quantum numbers .",
    "being identified on the basis of rather low statistics , further confirmation is necessary .",
    "however , if it does exist , it poses questions for hadrons with non - exotic quantum numbers as well . here",
    ", we discuss the @xmath19 and its possible relation to the @xmath0 problem in more detail .",
    "@xmath19 has strangeness @xmath113 and , being considered as a quark system , should contain at least 4 nonstrange quarks and 1 strange antiquark .",
    "its experimental mass agrees very well with a theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "this gives some hope that its spin and parity also correspond to the predicted values @xmath22 .",
    "however , the product of internal parities of 4 quarks and 1 antiquark is negative .",
    "therefore , the space wave - function of @xmath19 can not be pure @xmath18-wave ; it should contain at least one @xmath24-wave to make the total parity be positive .",
    "in quantum theory ( at least , non - relativistic ) there exists a mathematically exact result that the space wave function of the ground ( lowest - energy ) state should not have zeros . since the @xmath24-wave schrdinger function inevitably has at least one zero , the ground - state character of @xmath19 may be questionable .",
    "of course relativistic theory has some specifics , and there are recent statements  @xcite that in the particular case of the quark structure of @xmath19 , the hyperfine interaction may reverse the normal order of the lowest @xmath18- and @xmath24-wave states .",
    "however , the flavor dependence of such interaction prevents this property from being universal for all members of the @xmath21 antidecuplet which contains @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , if the non - strange partner of @xmath19 is indeed @xmath114 , as assumed by  @xcite , we can expect that it is not a ground state .",
    "dynamics of the 5-quark system may be rather unfamiliar .",
    "nevertheless , having nothing better at present , we can try to use 3-quark experience for a tentative estimate of the energetic  price \" of a @xmath24-wave in a system with nucleon flavor quantum numbers .",
    "the ground state for baryons with @xmath115 and @xmath10 is @xmath116 with @xmath22 .",
    "it corresponds to the 3-quark system having the pure @xmath18-wave space function and sum of the spins equal 1/2 .",
    "if we consider the corresponding excited system with one @xmath24-wave , we obtain two states with @xmath117 and @xmath118 having different masses due to @xmath119-coupling .",
    "particle tables  @xcite show that the lowest states with such quantum numbers are @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , with @xmath117 , both having the highest 4-star status .",
    "we see , therefore , that the @xmath119-coupling is relatively weak , while the @xmath24-wave excitation requires about 600  mev .    near @xmath114 ,",
    "with @xmath22 and 3-star status , we find @xmath123 , with @xmath124 and 4-star status .",
    "if they both are 5-quark systems with one @xmath24-wave , having the same energetic  price \" of about 600  mev , we expect that the corresponding ground state should have mass about 1100  mev .",
    "thus , it is just the mass region near the @xmath11-threshold where appearance of an @xmath0 is expected .",
    "the situation is schematically shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : g8 ] . by analogy with usual hadrons ,",
    "we show quantum numbers of @xmath0 as @xmath117 .",
    "however , the 5-quark system is , of course , complicated enough , and may manifest several states with nearby masses , having different values of @xmath125 .",
    "so far the picture of an @xmath0 as a 5-quark state looks sufficiently consistent .",
    "but , as we explained above , to support it , we should demonstrate that such a picture has the ability to describe the phenomenologically necessary suppression of couplings of @xmath0 with usual 3-quark baryons .",
    "dynamics of the 5-quark system may be essentially different from that of the 3-quark system .",
    "even the constituent - quark mass , being a dynamical quantity , might be different for these two cases ( most probably , it decreases with increasing the quark number ) .",
    "that is why we will not pretend here to give a reliable description of coupling constants for the 5-quark hadrons .",
    "however , we can recall some known phenomena which may provide a realistic basis to describe the suppression of couplings .    at first sight",
    ", the 5-quark baryon can be easily separated into a usual baryon ( 3 quarks ) and a usual meson ( quark and antiquark ) . but this may be difficult because of inappropriate color structure . in this connection , let us recall the color suppression , well known in weak decays ( especially , of heavy - quark mesons ) .",
    "[ fig : g9 ] shows two kinds of contributions for weak decays . in both cases , the @xmath126-boson produces the colorless quark - antiquark pair . in one case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g9]a ) , the pair directly transforms into a meson ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath127-meson ) , without any problem . in the other case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g9]b ) , the quark and antiquark , separately , produce hadrons together with other quarks and antiquarks of the system .",
    "not all color configurations of the pair are appropriate for the second process , so its amplitude contains the factor @xmath128 , and its probability contains @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of colors .",
    "thus , at @xmath131 such simple  color suppression \" , even in decays of  normal \" hadrons , provides a factor about 1/10 for the probability of the  suppressed \" final state .",
    "the increased number of quarks in the system should increase the number of possible inconsistencies in its color structures , which suppress decays of the system .",
    "double color suppression by itself would give the suppressing factor @xmath132 for the strong coupling between a 5-quark baryon and , say , the baryon - meson pair of usual octet hadrons .",
    "together with similar inconsistencies of the flavor and spin parts of the wave function , it may be not so hard to provide a suppression of @xmath109 for the coupling constants of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 for processes of its production .    if the color and spin - flavor structures of the 5-quark baryon are indeed capable of producing a suppression of @xmath109 or more for strong couplings of the 5-quark baryon , they should give , at least , the same suppression for the photon vertex of such a baryon .",
    "however , as we discussed in the preceding section , the phenomenological photon vertex may need even stronger suppression , at least , @xmath82 .",
    "let us consider whether this could be realistic .    in the framework of the constituent quark model , the diagonal and transition dipole moments ( say , magnetic moments ) for usual ( octet and decuplet ) baryons can be well described as simple matrix elements of the single - quark electromagnetic interaction between quark wave functions of the initial and final baryons .",
    "but such a simple approach can not work for the photon transition between 5- and 3-quark baryons , because of the different number of quarks .",
    "this vertex should have a more complicated structure , _",
    "e.g. _ , that of fig .",
    "[ fig : g10]a .",
    "it evidently contains the suppression of strong couplings , but its loop configuration may provide additional suppression , similar to the so - called  penguin \" diagrams of fig .  [",
    "fig : g10]b in weak processes .",
    "those diagrams do not have parametric smallness with respect to usual weak amplitudes , but are known to be numerically small .    the existence of diagrams like fig .",
    "[ fig : g10]a shows that the 1-photon transition between @xmath0 and @xmath17 may be suppressed , but can not be forbidden entirely , contrary to the suggestion of   @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , an interesting question arises as to whether the suppressed probability of the 1-photon decay for @xmath0 might become numerically of the same order as probability of the 2-photon decay .      with the existence of an @xmath0",
    "there inevitably emerge additional problems , related to the @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "what is its unitary multiplet ?",
    "and what are its unitary partners ?",
    "both questions require detailed investigation which will be given elsewhere . for now , we restrict ourselves to the simplest hypothesis of @xmath0 being a member of a unitary octet , and tentatively discuss other possible members of this octet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g11 ] ) .",
    "two of the potential candidates appear to be present in the pdg listings  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , both with low 1-star status .",
    "one more multiplet member might be the resonance @xmath133 observed as a peak in the system @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "all these states were observed in experiments with bubble chambers , and have been nearly forgotten with the coming of a new generation of detectors and facilities ( and also new energy regions ) .",
    "the latest publications are  @xcite on @xmath2 and  @xcite on @xmath3 .",
    "but recently they have begun to reappear .",
    "@xmath2 is seen in very preliminary data of cosy  @xcite , weak evidence for @xmath133 may be seen in a low statistics preliminary study of the @xmath134 spectrum at jlab ( hall b )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 has recently emerged in theoretical calculations of @xmath135-scattering in the framework of a unitary extension of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these calculations assign @xmath117 for @xmath3 , exactly as we suggested above for @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the gell - mann - okubo mass formula with masses of @xmath136 , and @xmath3 gives for @xmath0 just the mass of about 1100  mev  @xcite , in agreement with the estimation above , based on different arguments .",
    "present information on this tentative unitary octet is summarised in the table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "it shows , in particular , reported decay modes and values of hadronic production cross - sections .",
    "note that the corresponding cross - sections for photoproduction may be estimated as multiplied by the factor @xmath137 , while for electroproduction , the factor should be of order @xmath138 .",
    "of course , the experimental status of all these states is quite uncertain .",
    "publications , which report their observation , estimate their statistical significance at the 3 , or even 4 , standard deviation level ( for @xmath2 both the peak in the mass distribution and the polarization effect were reported  @xcite ) .",
    "many papers , which do not support those states , actually see the corresponding peaks , but can not exclude their non - resonant origin ( background fluctuations , kinematical reflections and so on ) .",
    "therefore , the problem should be further investigated at the modern level of accuracy .",
    "the recent discovery of @xmath19  @xcite ( of course , being reliably confirmed ) may open a new vista on the field of many - quark hadrons .",
    "their dynamics , though also based on qcd , can be phenomenologically different from the familiar strong interactions of the standard 3-quark and quark - antiquark hadrons . among other opening possibilities , there could ( or even should ) exist new light nonstrange baryon(s ) , with mass(es ) near @xmath17 and @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the present bounds on properties of the hypothetical light baryon(s ) @xmath0 .",
    "together with the dedicated experiments searching for @xmath0 , we also consider other data , not obviously directly related to @xmath0 .",
    "using these , we are able to enhance previous bounds , and obtain new ones , for both strong and electromagnetic couplings of the @xmath0 .    while @xmath1-like baryons ( with @xmath53 ) below the @xmath25-threshold are strongly excluded at the level of @xmath92   @xcite , it is not so for @xmath17-like states ( with @xmath10 ) in the same mass region . here , we show that all couplings of @xmath0 to the standard hadrons should be suppressed more strongly than a factor of @xmath109 .",
    "this implies small ( radiative ) decay widths and small production cross - sections ( less than @xmath16 or even @xmath139 with respect to analogous production of standard hadrons ) . above the @xmath11-threshold and up to the @xmath1-region , we obtain new restrictions for couplings of both @xmath10 and 3/2 nonstrange baryons , again at a level stronger than @xmath16 .",
    "though the 5-quark systems and their dynamics are complicated and insufficiently understood , we give arguments that the necessary phenomenological suppression may be realistic .",
    "we have also briefly discussed unitary multiplets possibly related to @xmath0 and 5-quark systems .",
    "they could be both familiar octets and decuplets , and also clearly exotic antidecuplets or even 27-plet(s ) ( note that @xmath1-like states do not appear in octets and/or antidecuplets ) .",
    "we have recalled some nearly forgotten states which could appear as unitary partners of @xmath0 .",
    "studies of such partners might give an alternative view of the problem of @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting in this connection that the reported cross - sections for hadronic production of those states ( of order of several @xmath140b , see table  [ tbl2 ] ) are consistent with rough estimates of several nb for photoproduction of @xmath19   @xcite ( the relative factor of @xmath137 ) .",
    "the problem of @xmath0 may have even broader interest than just hadron physics .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated recently that existence of @xmath0 may influence properties of neutron stars   @xcite and diminish their mass . since this result",
    "was used by the authors as an argument against the existence of @xmath0 ( the calculated limiting mass of the neutron star appears lower than the experimental value ) , we would like to note that similar problems might arise also due to ( well established ) hyperons .",
    "they , however , may be eliminated by other effects , such as rotation excitations , repulsive potentials and other effects   @xcite , which were not accounted for in  @xcite .",
