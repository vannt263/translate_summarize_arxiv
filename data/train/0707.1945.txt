    "black holes ( bhs ) and gravitational waves ( gws ) are the most important predictions of the einstein s theory of general relativity . in the history of these subjects",
    "; the discovery of schwarzchild bh is followed by the extension to the electrically charged version , reissner - nordstrm bh .",
    "this is followed by the discovery of rotating versions , kerr and kerr - newman bhs respectively . on the other side ,",
    "the topic of gw is developed and its characteristic properties are studied extensively .",
    "one of the research branch of gws is to consider their nonlinear interactions which is known in the literature as colliding gravitational waves ( cgws ) .",
    "this subject was popular in 1980 s and its peculiar features are very well investigated and catalogued in @xcite .",
    "the most common feature is the occurence of curvature singularities ; when two plane gw collide they focus each other in a way that after a finite time from the instant of the collision , a spacetime singularity develops .",
    "in contrast to this , exceptional solutions were found which do not exhibit curvature singularities , instead they develop killing - cauchy horizons @xcite . under what conditions the collision of waves",
    "produce a space - time curvature singularity or a killing - cauchy horizon ? .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this important question remains still open .",
    "the formation of horizons is a common feature for bhs and cgws .",
    "although they differ in global structure , they display some similarities against perturbations , for details see @xcite and references contained therein .",
    "yurtsever @xcite argued that all killing - cauchy horizons that develop in the collision of gravitational waves are unstable against plane symmetric perturbations .",
    "however , it is still early to generalize the yurtsever s results whether all horizons formed in cgw are unstable against arbitrary perturbations .",
    "plane waves in general relativity are obtained by an infinite boost , i.e. as the particle speed reaches the speed of light .",
    "collision of plane waves therefore , carries imprints from the high energy particle collisions ; a popular subject nowadays in connection with the large hadron collision experiments to be conducted at cern . since the hawking s seminal contribution , quantum mechanical treatment of space time is believed to create mini bhs .",
    "apart from the quantal feats , by geometric construction , classical collision of high energetic particles / wave packets do create also bhs .",
    "this amounts all to the formation of a stable horizon capable to hide highly concentrated matter inside against instability , which is followed by an immediate decay . by taking the idea of particle collisions to very extreme",
    "it can be argued that upon mutual focussing strong , finely tuned non - vacuum plane waves can produce bhs at a classical level as well .",
    "this , however , must be valid for the class of collisions in which a stable cauchy horizon forms .",
    "these two topics , bhs and cgws have developed along their own track .",
    "however , an interesting duality relation between them was observed by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( cx ) @xcite ( hereafter this will be referred as paper i ) . the remarkable aspect of paper",
    "i is that , the two seemingly unrelated topics bhs and cgws is shown to be locally isometric .",
    "the solution in paper i describes the collision of impulsive gravitational waves accompanied with shock gravitational waves which is locally isometric to the part of the region in between the inner ( cauchy ) and outer ( event ) horizons of the kerr black hole .",
    "later on , the einstein - maxwell extension of paper i is given by cx@xcite ( hereafter this will be referred as , paper ii ) .",
    "this latter solution is locally isometric to the part of the trapped region of the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole .",
    "the physical properties of paper i and ii are analysed in detail by cx .",
    "one of the property is the analytic extension of the space - time beyond the horizon for both papers i and ii",
    ". such extensions of space - times beyond the horizon are known to be non - unique and in the extended domain two - dimensional time - like singularities along hyperbolic arcs are displayed .",
    "another bh related cgw solution is obtained by yurtsever @xcite for parallel polarization ( or independently by ferrari - ibanez@xcite ) which is known to be isometric to the part of interior region of the schwarzchild bh .",
    "the reserch in the bh area has extended by adding different kind of sources like cosmological constant , a nut and an acceleration parameters .",
    "bh solutions with these extensions are of type -d class .",
    "the general class of type - d metrics presented long ago by plebanski and demianski ( pd ) @xcite that contain all these parameters .",
    "recently , higher dimensional generalisations of kerr - nut -(anti)desitter spacetime is presented in clp1 , clp2 .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of these parameters especially the nut parameter has not been clarified . in general , the nut parameter is associated with the gravomagnetic monopole parameter of the central mass , but the common consensus on its exact physical meaning has not been attained yet .",
    "the physical significance of the nut parameter in the kerr - nut -(anti)desitter spacetimes is investigated for the basic four dimensional case in @xcite . in this article",
    ", it is clarified that the dominance of the nut parameter over the rotation parameter leaves the spacetime free of curvature singularities and the corresponding solution is named as nut - like solution .",
    "but if the rotation parameter dominates the nut parameter , the solution is kerr - like and a ring curvature singularity arise .",
    "note that , this kind of behaviour on the singularity structure is independent of the presence of the cosmological constant . in another study @xcite , the nut parameter is interpreted physically as the twist of the universe .",
    "our interest in this paper relies completely on the isometric equivalence of the extended - bh solutions with cgw metrics .",
    "for example , cosmological term in bh solution is equivalent to couple matter fields in the corresponding isometric cgw problem . in other words",
    ", null - shells must be added to the colliding waves to obtain a cosmological constant .",
    "however , the inclusion of null - shells transform the cauchy horizon into a curvature singularity .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to address various subclasses of pd - family of solutions that admit  cauchy horizons in the isometric cgw problems and investigate further through an analytic continuation beyond the cauchy horizon .",
    "one such case was identified before by papacostas and xanthopoulos ( px ) @xcite who showed that the metric can be extended to full regularity .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to identify another case which incorporates the nut parameter and to investigate its physical effect in the space of colliding waves .",
    "our starting point is the kerr - newman - nut ( knn ) black hole with its transform to the cgw .",
    "this will provide a nut extension of the cx metrics ( both for paper i and ii ) which was not identified explicitly in ref .",
    "we shall verify that our metric is distinct from the one studied by px , although both are naturally within the transforms of pd family .",
    "although isometry between black holes and cgw hardly finds application beyond 5-dimensional black holes , black p - branes of arbitrary dimensions come to our rescue . in this",
    "regard we consider colliding higher dimensional forms obtained from the black p - branes .",
    "recently , we have obtained such regular solutions @xcite and in this paper , we show how their analytic extension works in analogy with the lower dimensions .",
    "we show that the passive role of the higher dimensions does not effect the analytic extension which is already known to be non - unique .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the solution and the analytic extension as explained in paper i. in section iii , we present the nut extension of paper ii and compare it with the px solution .",
    "section iv , is devoted for the analytic extension of the metric obtained in section iii .",
    "colliding waves in higher dimensions is considered in section v. the paper ends with the conclusion in section vii .",
    "cx found a colliding wave solution in the vacuum einstein theory which is locally isometric to the part of the region in between the inner and outer horizons of the kerr black hole .",
    "the metric is given by    @xmath0    in which we define coordinates @xmath1 ( in place of @xmath2 coordinates of cx ) in terms of the null coordinates @xmath3 by    @xmath4    and @xmath5 .",
    "the metric functions are    @xmath6    in which the constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 must satisfy @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the freedom of overall scaling by a constant is employed throughout the paper whenever appropriate.the remarkable property of the metric ( 1 ) is that in contrast to other solutions the killing - cauchy horizon develops in the region of interaction .",
    "the metric ( 1 ) transforms into the boyer - lindquist form of the kerr black hole , if the following transformation is used :    @xmath10    with    @xmath11    we have the correspondence ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 now stands for the horizon function    @xmath14    with these substitutions the line element ( 1 ) is expressed in the form    @xmath15 ^{2}-\\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{\\widetilde{\\delta } } \\left [ dr^{2}+\\widetilde{% \\delta } d\\theta ^{2}\\right ] -\\left [ \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta } \\rho ^{2}\\sin ^{2}\\theta } { \\widetilde{\\delta } -a^{2}\\delta } \\right ] d\\phi ^{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the parameters of rotation and mass respectively .",
    "the roots of @xmath19 , namely , @xmath20 and @xmath21are known as the event ( outer ) and cauchy ( inner ) horizons , respectively .",
    "therefore , the colliding wave solution is locally isometric to the part of the kerr metric in between the two horizons .",
    "this is done by first observing that the killing vector @xmath22 and its scalar product with the other killing vector @xmath23 vanishes on the killing - cauchy horizon at @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , the killing vector @xmath26 becomes null when @xmath27 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "the non - unique extension of the resulting space - time in the region of interaction is obtained by the following trasformation .",
    "@xmath28    such that @xmath29 .    with this transformation it was shown by cx that the analytic extension of the space - time across the killing - cauchy horizon reveals the occurence of time - like curvature singularities along the two dimensional hyperbolic arcs as shown in fig.1 .",
    "another interesting colliding wave solution of cx is the one obtained in the einstein - maxwell theory ( paper ii ) .",
    "impulsive gravitational waves and accompanying gravitational and electromagnetic shock waves are the waves that takes part in the latter collision and as a result , a non - singular killing - cauchy horizon develops . it was shown also that the interaction region is locally isometric to the part of the region in between the inner ( cauchy ) and outer ( event ) horizons of the kn black hole .",
    "the same methodology has also been applied to extend the resulting metric across this horizon .",
    "their analyses proved that the time - like singularities along hyperbolic arcs developed in the extended domain in analogy with the singularity obtained in paper i.",
    "in the previous section an isometry has been established between the two horizons of a kerr black hole and cgw . the horizon function @xmath30 admitted two roots : the outer horizon @xmath20 and the inner horizon @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath32 we have a case in which the time - like coordinate becomes space - like ( and vice versa ) and the geometry admits two space - like killing vectors instead of one time - like and one space - like .",
    "this particular region can suitably be mapped into the interaction region of cgw .",
    "more generally @xmath13 can be a higher order polynomial admitting more than two roots .",
    "no multi - horizon case , however ,  guarantees a priori any association with cgw .",
    "each one of such cases should be checked whether this is possible or not .",
    "another particular case where we have still a quadratic @xmath33 which we shall elaborate on , is the knn black hole @xcite .",
    "the metric describing the knn  black hole is given by ,    @xmath34 ^{2}-% \\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{u^{2}}dr^{2}-\\rho ^{2}d\\theta ^{2}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath35    in which the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the rotation , electric charge and nut parameters , respectively .",
    "it describes a stationary axially symmetric body with gravitomagnetic monopole and dipole moments associated with nonzero values of the nut @xmath38 and kerr @xmath39 parameters .",
    "it can also be interpreted as the gravitational dyon solution that represents the gravitational field of a rotating body having both gravitational electric and magnetic charges .",
    "the knn solution belongs to the petrov type - d solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations for which the space - time admits separable hamilton - jacobi , klein - gordon and dirac equations , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one remarkable property satisfied by the kerr - nut metric ( i.e. for @xmath40 ) is the duality invariance which is defined by @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "is there a similar duality invariance associated with the cgw metric ? .",
    "the mixing of radial and angular coordinates has already been imposed by the isometry transformation ( see eq.(7 ) below ) and any further symmetry is prohibited by the symmetry of the cgw . as a matter of fact",
    "the transformation is itself a duality , i.e. the cx - duality  between black holes and cgws .",
    "once we are in the space of cgw the invariance is restricted to @xmath43 in the null plane and to @xmath44 in the orthogonal space .",
    "any further mixing of these two sectors does not work .",
    "having in mind all these features , it would be interesting  to find the corresponding isometric geometry in the space of cgw and explore its physical properties .",
    "the corresponding cgw metric can be determined by using the transformation    @xmath45    and after setting the mass parameter @xmath46 , the cgw metric can be cast in the form    @xmath47    our notation and abbreviations in this metric are as follow    @xmath48    where    @xmath49    in which @xmath50  so that @xmath51 obviously it is clear from the square root expression that the nut parameter @xmath37 is constrained by @xmath52 .",
    "this constraint condition is crucial for having a non - singular cgw space - time . in order to interpret the foregoing metric as cgw the null coordinates",
    "must be multiplied everywhere by the unit step functions , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for the sake of simplicity in the rest of the paper we shall set @xmath55 .",
    "let us note also that the @xmath56 coordinates of cx are equivalent to our @xmath57 by the additional transformations @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "although this rescaling of coordinates is not imperative it has the advantage that the @xmath60 component of the metric can be expressed in the simplest possible form , namely @xmath61 ( after an overall scaling by a factor 2 ) . note that for @xmath62 the metric in eq.(8 ) overlaps with the one obtained long ago by wang @xcite which is the nut extension of paper i. however , the physical significance of the nut parameter was not the scope of that paper .",
    "the non zero ricci components due to the em field in the newman - penrose formalism are given , after tedious calculation by@xmath63 .",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]we recall that exact determination of the phases @xmath64 of the maxwell spinors @xmath65 and @xmath66 is possible through the tedious integration of the maxwell equations .",
    "fourtunately this is not necessary in the present study and for this reason we shall ignore it .      in order that the metric ( 8) can be interpreted as a cgw metric it has to satisfy certain boundary conditions . to determine the initial data we extrapolate the interaction region back a@xmath67la cx to find the incoming regions .",
    "the initial data associated with region ii @xmath68 is obtained by dropping the @xmath69 in the metric .",
    "this amounts to the substitution @xmath70 , so that the metric functions take the form    @xmath71 ,   \\notag \\\\ & &   \\notag \\\\",
    "g(u ) & = & \\cos ^{2}u\\left [ a_{0}\\cos ^{2}u-2l_{0}\\sin u+a_{0}\\left ( \\left ( p+\\sin u\\right ) ^{2}+a_{0}^{2}+l_{0}^{2}\\right ) \\right ] ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which@xmath72 is implied with the unit step function . the only non zero ricci component in this region is given by    @xmath73",
    "while the gravitational wave component @xmath74 has the form    @xmath75    in which @xmath76 stands for the dirac delta function and @xmath77 is a well defined function .",
    "an impulsive gravitational wave superposed with a shock gravitational wave constitutes the general feature of these waves .",
    "similar data is obtained for region iii @xmath78 by the substitution @xmath79 , which will not be given .",
    "obviously region iii has the corresponding non - vanishing ricci and weyl components    @xmath80    where the function @xmath81 similar to @xmath82 above is a well defined function whose exact form is not of much interest here and we shall not give them explicitly .",
    "expectedly all these components are much more involved relative to the ones considered by cx .",
    "further extrapolation , by letting @xmath83 and @xmath84 in ( 8) reduces our metric into    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    which is manifestly flat in a rescaled coordinate system .",
    "it is evident from the data ( eq .",
    "13 and 14 ) for region ii ( and similar expression for region iii ) that both of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 corresponding to the angular momentum and nut parameters of the original black hole solution transform under the isometry ( 7 ) into the parameter of cross ( or second ) polarization of the waves .",
    "linear polarization limit corresponds to the case @xmath89 , as can easily be checked from the metric component @xmath90 .    in the presence of electromagnetic waves",
    "it had been shown that the appropriate boundary conditions are those of obrien and synge @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the same boundary conditions , provided we verify the absence of any current sources on the null boundaries .",
    "these can be summarized by the continuity requirements of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 refers to the null coordinates with the condition that @xmath95 . for more detail on the choice of the boundary conditions we refer to ref .",
    "[ 1 ] and references cited therein . while the other conditions are self evident the critical condition to be checked is the continuity of    @xmath96    and    @xmath97    when worked out in detail these reduce to the requirements that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are both continuous across @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . in summary , these are both continuous , the obrien - synge conditions are satisfied and no extra sources are created in the collision process derived from the isometry with the knn black hole .",
    "our interaction region @xmath102 metric ( 8) is equivalent ( isometric ) to the knn metric ( 6 ) , in fact it is obtained from the latter by a coordinate transformation .",
    "in this section we wish to make use of this advantage to find a proper tetrad that gives @xmath103 and @xmath104 as the only nonvanishing weyl and ricci  scalars .",
    "our choice of the proper tetrad is ,    @xmath105    where    @xmath106    in which the parameter @xmath107 is related to our previous parameter @xmath7 through    @xmath108    in this proper tetrad the type - d character of our space - time becomes manifest with the @xmath103 and @xmath104 as follows    @xmath109 ^{3}% } , \\ ] ]    @xmath110 ^{2}}.\\ ] ]    here although @xmath111 is the electric charge of the original black hole , under the isometric transformation ( 7 ) it transforms together with the other parameters of the black hole , into @xmath8 of the cgw metric .",
    "it is clear to observe that when @xmath40 , the solution reduces to kerr - nut , which is the nut extension of the paper i. when @xmath112 , our solution reduces to the vacuum ( i.e. kerr ) einstein solution which corresponds to the paper i. if we further choose @xmath113 but @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the resulting metric corresponds to the charged - nut metric which has not been considered by cx . in general , the term @xmath116 in the weyl scalar @xmath103 represent the twist parameter of the gravitational wave .",
    "hence , the nut parameter @xmath37 has the tendency to increase the existing twist in the paper i and ii .",
    "investigation of @xmath103 and @xmath117reveals also that the nut extension of paper ii is another new non - singular solution . in the limit @xmath118 ,",
    "both remain finite , implying that the hypersurface @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 is a cauchy - horizon instead of a singular hypersurface .",
    "the px metric obtained from a member of pd family is expressed , after minor rearrangements by @xmath121 .\\ ] ]    the crucial parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 are constants while @xmath124 and @xmath125 are both linear functions of their arguments inherited from the pd  family of solutions without the cosmological constant .",
    "we wish to compare this metric with our metric ( 8) which was obtained directly from the knn black hole . in order to establish a connection ( if any ) between ( 8) and ( 20 )",
    "it is suggestive to identify    @xmath126    and compare the @xmath127 components of both metrics . by choosing @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath130 of ( 8) equals @xmath131 of ( 20 ) .",
    "next , by rescaling @xmath132 in accordance with @xmath133 ( and removing the bar over @xmath132 afterwards ) we expect that @xmath134 functions will also match with @xmath135 and @xmath90 of ( 20 ) .",
    "it turns out that such an identification fails except at the singular hypersurfaces characterized by @xmath119 and @xmath136 this verifies that the metrics ( 8) and ( 20 ) are different limiting cases of the original pd familiy members . in the proper tetrad and in terms of the functions @xmath137 our weyl and ricci components ( i.e. ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) ) take the compact forms    @xmath138    for the metric ( 20 ) , on the other hand , the choice of the proper null tetrad one - forms    @xmath139    yields    @xmath140    it is observed that the non - vanishing tetrad scalars of the two metrics are not identical .",
    "this originates from the fact that in the original pd metrics further identification and linear transformation should be applied before arriving at the knn metric .",
    "since this has not been done the nut parameter remained unidentified and ( 8) remained distinct from ( 20 ) .",
    "we observe after setting @xmath128 and @xmath141 that , the px metric does not possess the limit @xmath142 , whereas ( 8) remains meaningful .",
    "the @xmath103 in ( 8) reveals that all limiting cases are well defined ; @xmath143 , @xmath144 @xmath145 , @xmath142 ; or @xmath146 obviously the charged - nut case corresponds to @xmath142 , @xmath147 and @xmath114 , and is a new case not included in the analysis of cx ( or px ) . in the special case",
    "@xmath148 @xmath149 ( or @xmath150 ) , however the two metrics become identical .",
    "one more distinction arises when we consider an unbounded nut parameter @xmath151 .",
    "evidently the metric ( 8) has @xmath152 , while for the metric ( 20 ) we obtain @xmath153 .",
    "the line element ( 8) describes the nut extension of the colliding wave solution due to the cx in the einstein - maxwell theory . the determinant of the metric in the @xmath154 coordinates is given by ,    @xmath155    it is obvious that as @xmath156 , the determinant vanishes on the surface @xmath25 which is equivalent to @xmath157 .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the weyl and ricci scalars remain finite on this surface , indicating no scalar curvature singularity .",
    "therefore the vanishing of determinant would only has meant that there exists a coordinate singularity and it can be removed by an appropriate transformation .    in order to perform the analytic extension",
    ", we shall adopt the method given by cx in paper i. as a requirement of the method , at least one of the killing vector fields should become null on the horizon .",
    "this is provided by calculating the norm of the killing vectors on the horizon surface .",
    "the norm of the killing vectors are    @xmath158    we observe that none of the norms of the killing vectors vanish on the horizon surface ( as @xmath118 ) . in other words",
    "the killing vectors @xmath159 and  @xmath160 are both space - like .",
    "as it was stated in paper i , the killing vectors @xmath159 or  @xmath160 can be made null if the integration constant for the metric function @xmath161 is chosen properly . in order to assign the same role on these killing vectors we take their linear combination . as we shall explore in the following section this choice plays a crucial role as far as the singularity structure is concerned in the extended domain .",
    "we choose the new killing vector as ,    @xmath162    where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are non - zero constants .",
    "we impose the condition that the norm of the new killing vector @xmath165should vanish on the horizon surface as @xmath118 .",
