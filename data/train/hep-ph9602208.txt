    "we present in this letter a theoretical reassessment of the evaluation of the top quark production cross section in high - energy hadronic collisions .",
    "the top quark having been found @xcite , the comparison between its observed production properties and those expected from the standard model will be an important probe of the possible existence of new phenomena .",
    "one of the most important tests to be performed concerns the total production cross section .",
    "this is the most inclusive quantity available , and is a priori the least sensitive to a detailed understanding of the higher order corrections which influence the evolution of the initial and final states . within qcd ,",
    "one expects the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath6 to be well behaved and to provide an accurate estimate of the total cross section already at low orders . in particular ,",
    "the first estimates of the total production cross section using the full next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) matrix elements  @xcite gave an increase ( relative to the born result ) of the order of 30% for masses above 100 gev .",
    "the residual perturbative qcd uncertainty , evaluated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales , was shown to be no larger than 10% .",
    "the choice of parametrization for the input parton densities was also shown to give effects of this order of magnitude , by using the available sets .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that logarithmic contributions associated to the emission of soft gluons from the initial state could significantly enhance the nlo result .",
    "an independent study of the soft gluon resummation in top production has appeared recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies are based on the resummation formulae obtained in the pioneering works of refs .",
    "@xcite . using these formulae for explicit calculations",
    "requires the choice of a prescription in order to bypass the landau - pole singularity which is exposed by the integration of the qcd running coupling over gluon energies of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "in particular it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , within the proposed formalism , one can get sensible results only by cutting off the soft gluon emission at scales below @xmath8 . the choice made in ref .",
    "@xcite follows instead a suggestion put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this prescription the landau pole appearing in the mellin transform of the resummed hard cross section",
    "should be integrated over in a principal value sense .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this prescription results in non - perturbative power - suppressed ambiguities scaling like @xmath9 in the hard scale @xmath10 typical of the process under consideration .",
    "the net effect of gluon resummation evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite amounts to an increase by approximately 10% of the nlo cross section .",
    "in a companion paper @xcite we will show that the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite overestimate both the gluon resummation contribution and the associated non - perturbative residual uncertainty .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that their resummation formulae introduce unjustified factorially growing terms in the perturbative expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite we will also show that a more natural prescription exists , in which these terms are not present . in the following , we will briefly summarize the basis of our criticism and the definition and main properties of the new proposed resummation prescription .",
    "we will then present a numerical study indicating that the impact of resummation on the total top production cross section is of the order of a percent , much smaller than previously thought .",
    "we will also show that threshold corrections due to higher order coulomb effects are likewise negligible .",
    "we will conclude this study with an updated analysis of the current theoretical uncertainties coming from the scale dependence , from the choice of partonic densities and from the value of .",
    "it should be pointed out that this study is performed within the strict domain of the standard model .",

    "the functions @xmath13 are the parton densities for parton @xmath14 in hadron @xmath15 , and are evaluated at a scale @xmath16 of the order of the heavy quark mass @xmath11 .",
    "explicit formulae for the partonic cross section @xmath17 can be found for example in ref .",

    "n=_0 ^ 1 z^n(z ) .",
    "the integration contour lies to the right of all singularities .",
    "we use the following resummed formula [ sigmares ] ^(res)=_i , j = q|q,|qq , gg _ c_mp - i^c_mp+i f^(1,i)_n+1f^(2,j)_n+1 ^(ij)_n+1 ^(ij)_n ^-n dn .",

    "the factor @xmath21 resums all the leading logarithmic terms @xmath22 due to soft gluon emission . the contour in eq .  ( [ sigmares ] ) is chosen between the cuts on the negative @xmath18 axis and the singularity at @xmath23 , which is a landau pole",
    ". we will call this the minimal prescription ( mp ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we will show that this prescription enjoys the following remarkable properties :    * it is accurate at the leading log level in the threshold limit . *",
    "if we expand the mp formula in powers of @xmath24 , the expansion is asymptotic to the full formula .",
    "* the power expansion of the mp formula does not have any factorially growing coefficients , and therefore is free of ambiguities of the order of powers of @xmath25 .",
    "the ambiguity associated with the asymptotic expansion of the mp resummation is exponentially suppressed , being of the order @xmath26 .",
    "we claim that previous calculations of resummation effects @xcite have a corresponding power expansion which does have factorially growing terms .",
    "these terms are spurious .",
    "they arise either from certain approximations performed when going from the @xmath18 space to the @xmath27 space formulae , or from the integration of the running coupling constant down to the landau singularity .",
    "our result is consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicating that no power - like @xmath28 ambiguity emerges from the resummation of multiple gluon emission in drell  yan processes",
    ".    a full discussion of these issues will appear in a companion paper @xcite , where we will also study the implications of this prescription for drell  yan , heavy quark and jet production in hadronic collisions .    in the present work we will report on results obtained with our mp formula of eq .",
    "( [ sigmares ] ) , which was implemented without any further approximation in a numerical program .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained for a very heavy quark , and in particular for the top cross section .",
    "first of all , we remind the reader that large soft gluon effects are present not only in the production cross section , but also in the deep - inelastic processes that are used to determine the structure functions . in order to perform a complete study of the resummation one should therefore use resummed formulae also when fitting deep - inelastic scattering data , direct photon production data , and in general all phenomena which are used to constrain the parton densities . in the present work we will assume that the structure functions have been properly extracted from data ( including the resummation effects ) and assess the significance of the resummation for heavy flavour production .",
    "effects of comparable size may arise from refitting the structure functions using resummed formulae .",
    "our conclusions will mostly be based upon the fact that the resummation effects we find are in fact very small , and can be neglected .",
    "the importance of the resummation effects is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ frtev ] where we plot the quantities , , where @xmath29 is equal to our mp resummed hadronic cross section  ( [ sigmares ] ) in which the terms of order @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been subtracted , and @xmath32 is the full hadronic nlo cross section  @xcite .    in other words , what we display is the relative contribution to the total cross section coming from corrections of order higher than those accounted for by the full nlo result .",
    "we show the results for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 production channels separately , as well as for the total .",
    "the results are shown at @xmath35tev as a function of the top mass in the range @xmath36 .",
    "the wide mass range is chosen for the sole purpose of illustration .",
    "we chose a common renormalization and factorization scale @xmath37 , and parton densities from the cteq1 set @xcite .",
    "the plot clearly indicates that the contribution of soft - gluon resummation is negligible , unless the top mass approaches the total hadronic energy .",
    "this result is consistent with the expectation that the soft gluon enhancement of the production cross sections should be relevant only very close to threshold . for a top mass of @xmath38",
    "gev the increase due to this effect is below 1% .",
    "we also note that the effect of resummation is potentially much larger for the @xmath34 channel , because of the @xmath39 enhancement in the exponent of the resummation formula ( see eq .",
    "[ g1hf ] ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that when the @xmath34 subprocess becomes important ( _ i.e. _ for small top masses ) we are so far from threshold that the resummation effect is very small .",
    "conversely , for large masses , the quark component , which has smaller resummation effects , dominates .",
    "we see that at the lhc , where production is dominated by the @xmath34 initial state , we are far enough from the hadronic threshold , so that the resummation effects are again small .",
    "we conclude therefore that the effects of gluon resummation can be neglected at the present stage , as they are much smaller than the uncertainties present in the nlo determination .",
    "note that , due to the dominance of the @xmath34 subprocess , the relative importance of the resummation effects at @xmath40 tev is larger in @xmath41 collisions than in @xmath42 .    beside the soft gluon emission effects , also coulomb effects may enhance or deplete the cross section near threshold @xcite .",
    "we have calculated these effects in the following way .",
    "we have separated the partonic born cross section formulae into their colour singlet and octet components ^(gg)&=&_(8)^(gg)+_(1)^(gg ) + ^(q|q)&=&_(8)^(q|q ) where @xmath43 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and _",
    "( 1)^(gg)()= , where @xmath44 .",
    "the coulomb - resummed cross section is given as ^coul ( ) = _",
    "( 8) ( ) + _ ( 1 ) ( ) .",
    "we do not include bound state effects , which , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , are much smaller . in fig .",
    "[ topcoul ] we have plotted the hadronic quantity which ( similarly to the case of soft gluon effects ) represents the relative correction due to the resummation of coulomb effects not already included into the nlo results .",
    "we see that these effects are similar in magnitude to the soft - gluon effects , and fully negligible at the tevatron .",
    "since at the lhc we are further away from the threshold region , we conclude that also there they will be negligible",
    ". therefore , the following estimates of the top cross section will not include neither soft gluon effects , nor coulombic ones .",
    "electroweak corrections to top production in hadronic collisions have been considered in refs .",
    "they range from -0.97% to -1.74% of the born cross section , for a higgs mass of 60 and 1000 gev respectively  @xcite .",
    "they will also not be included in the following estimates .",
    "we now proceed to review the current theoretical uncertainties that arise at nlo .",
    "uncertainties due to unknown higher - order effects are usually accounted for by varying the renormalization ( @xmath45 ) and factorization ( @xmath46 ) scales . in principle , independent variations of the two scales should be considered . in fig .",
    "[ scales ] we show the scale dependence of the top cross section .",
    "note that there is compensation of the factorization scale dependence when the different subprocesses are added up .",
    "in particular , the @xmath34 and @xmath47 factorization scale dependence have opposite behaviour .",
    "in fact , it is only the combined scale dependence that can be considered an estimate of the neglected subleading corrections . as a second point",
    ", we observe that the maximum of the cross section is reached around @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the usual choice of the range @xmath49 appears to be particularly justified in this case . as a third point , we observe that the scale dependence in the cross section goes in the same direction for the two scales , so that , for the purpose of estimating the associated uncertainty , it is sufficient to consider the simultaneous variation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    aside from the scale uncertainties , which reflect the limitations of the perturbative qcd calculation ,",
    "there are uncertainties associated to our imprecise knowledge of the physical parameters involved .",
    "in particular , the strong coupling constant is determined within a certain accuracy . in the case of top production at the tevatron ,",
    "larger strong couplings tend to give larger partonic cross section . however , for larger strong couplings , the altarelli ",
    "parisi evolution , which occurs along the wide span in @xmath50 from the values at which deep - inelastic fits are performed ( @xmath51 ) to the top mass , softens the quark parton densities , thereby decreasing the cross section . in order to perform a fair estimate of the uncertainty due to @xmath52 , we need sets of parton densities fitted with different values of the strong coupling . the sets of ref .",
    "@xcite meet our purpose that accompany the fortran program for the structure function sets of ref .",
    "@xcite are not consistent with the values of @xmath20 quoted there , the differences being of the order of 1% . in the present work ,",
    "we extract the values of @xmath53 from their quoted values of @xmath20 using the standard two - loop formula  . ] . in fig .",
    "[ lambdavar ] we show the cross section as a function of the strong coupling .    for comparison",
    "we also show the @xmath20 dependence if the parton densities are kept fixed .",
    "we see the remarkable reduction in the @xmath20 dependence due to the compensation of the rise of the partonic cross section and the decrease of the quark parton densities .",
    "our results for the top cross section are collected in tables [ top175 ] , [ top160 ] and [ top190 ] , for values of the top mass that span the current uncertainties .",
    "we also show results obtained with with the recent parametrization derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the cdf jet data .",
    "we stress that the numbers in the table are obtained with a standard two - loop calculation .",
    "no resummation effects are included .",
    "our ranges for the top cross section are thus given by @xmath54  pb , @xmath55  pb , @xmath56  pb for = 160 , 175 , 190 gev respectively , and are adequately fitted in this range by the expression ( t|t)=e^ ( ) . as a central value for our determination we have chosen the mrsa@xmath57 @xcite result with @xmath58 , in association with a value of @xmath59gev ( which corresponds to @xmath60 , according to the standard two - loop formula @xcite ) . for the mrs sets with variable @xmath61 , we have used @xmath62gev ( which corresponds to @xmath63 ) .    in @xmath42 collisions at @xmath64tev",
