    "a particle - antiparticle asymmetry in dark matter , similar to that in baryons , would provide a natural link between their observed abundances .",
    "a classic example of such _ asymmetric _ dark matter ( adm ) is the lightest neutral technibaryon ( tb ) @xcite with a mass of @xmath1 tev in technicolour ( tc ) models of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "other techni - interacting massive particles ( timps ) @xcite have been considered , some of which are pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) of the tc interactions , hence lighter with mass of @xmath2 gev .    while gravitational instability in collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) explains structure formation on large scales well , the predicted substructure on galactic scales is at variance with observations suggesting that cdm may be _ self - interacting _",
    "@xcite . if adm arises in a strongly coupled theory as a _ composite _",
    "particle @xmath3 then it would naturally have self - interactions , with a cross - section large enough to address the small scale structure issue if their strong - interaction scale is of @xmath4(gev ) ( assuming the scaling resembles that in qcd ) .",
    "the self - annihilation cross - section would naturally be of the same order , ensuring that no significant symmetric abundance survives from the early universe . the relic abundance",
    "is then given simply by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the respective asymmetries of baryons and adm ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7 ) .",
    "now if some process ensures @xmath8 then the observed cosmological dark matter abundance is realised for a @xmath0 gev @xmath3 particle .",
    "excitingly , recent signals in the underground direct detection experiments dama @xcite and cogent @xcite have been interpreted in terms of such light dark matter @xcite and generated renewed interest in gev scale adm from new strong dynamics @xcite .",
    "while subsequent experiments like xenon100 @xcite and cdmsii @xcite have not confirmed these claims , their results still allow @xmath0 gev cdm with a spin - independent scattering cross - section on nucleons as high as @xmath9  @xmath10 .",
    "moreover such particles can be accreted by the sun in large numbers ( since they can not annihilate ) and affect heat transport so as to measurably alter the fluxes of low energy neutrinos @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we consider a mechanism for generating light asymmetric dark matter by extending the standard @xmath11 model ( sm ) to include a new strong interaction exhibiting two sectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 : + i ) @xmath12 breaks ew symmetry dynamically at a scale @xmath14 and the composite spectrum includes @xmath1 tev mass particles tb carrying a new global @xmath15 , just like ` technibaryons ' in technicolour @xcite .",
    "the constituents of tb carry weak quantum numbers such that tb couples to the fermion number violating ew sphaleron interactions which distribute any pre - existing fermion asymmetry between baryons and tb s , ensuring that : @xmath16 ii ) @xmath13 is uncharged under the sm and becomes strongly interacting at a scale @xmath17 of @xmath4(gev ) ; its spectrum includes ( composite ) few gev mass particles @xmath3 also carrying the global @xmath15 quantum number . the two sectors are coupled via operators that induce @xmath15 preserving fast decays : @xmath18 .",
    "this interaction keeps @xmath3 in equilibrium with t down to @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ below the temperature @xmath20 at which the sphaleron interactions ` freeze - out ' .",
    "thus the sphaleron induced asymmetry in tb is converted into a similar asymmetry in @xmath3 : @xmath21 this naturally connects the relic density of light adm to the relic density of baryons via sphalerons , _ without _ requiring @xmath3 ( or its constituents ) to carry ew quantum numbers .",
    "thus experimental constraints on such light particles from the @xmath22 decay width _ etc _ are not relevant .",
    "in fact all that is necessary to generate light adm via sphalerons is ew charged states at the weak scale which can decay rapidly into adm .",
    "however we consider it more appealing to link adm to dynamical ew symmetry breaking and consider the possibility that the two sectors above arise from a _ single _ strongly interacting ( technicolour ) extension of the sm which develops two different dynamical scales @xmath23",
    ".    this can happen _",
    "e.g. _ if the theory contains fermions in _ different _ representations of the tc gauge group since the critical value @xmath24 of the coupling which breaks chiral symmetry depends on the quadratic casimir @xmath25 of the representation ( using a simple one - gluon exchange estimate ) @xcite .",
    "this possibility has been considered in ` two - scale ' tc @xcite  a variant of the earlier idea @xcite that if qcd contains fermions in a higher - dimensional representation , then these might dynamically break the ew symmetry at the correct scale .",
    "a second possibility is if large four - fermion operators are present as in the gauged nambu - jona - lasanio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "if the four - fermion coupling is sufficiently large , this interaction can drive chiral symmetry breaking , allowing a much smaller value of the critical gauge coupling as in ` top quark condensation ' @xcite or ` topcolour ' @xcite models .",
    "if only some of the fermions participate in the four - fermion interactions , a scale separation can arise .",
    "sm singlet techni - fermions have been introduced earlier @xcite in models of ` minimal walking technicolour ' @xcite and ` conformal technicolor ' @xcite , in order to achieve ( near- ) conformal or ` walking ' dynamics , while still maintaining a minimal sector which breaks ew symmetry .",
    "we consider a non - abelian gauge theory with gauge group @xmath26 : @xmath27 fermions transforming according to a representation @xmath28 of @xmath26 are gauged under the ew symmetry , and @xmath29 fermions transforming according to a representation @xmath30 of @xmath26 are sm singlets .",
    "using the ladder approximation to the schwinger - dyson equations , the critical value of the coupling for chiral symmetry breaking is @xcite : @xmath31 we now take the gauge group to be @xmath32 and consider representations such that @xmath33 . integrating the one - loop beta - function @xmath34 from @xmath14 to @xmath17 yields the ratio of the scales : @xmath35 \\",
    ", \\label{eq : scaleratio}\\ ] ] since @xmath36,or equivalently @xmath37 , the fermions in the representation @xmath28 are , in this approximation , decoupled below @xmath14 , so only @xmath38 appears in the exponent .",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath24 are small then the scale separation can be large , _",
    "i.e. _ we can have @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath24 should be compared to the two - loop fixed point value of the coupling : @xmath41 if @xmath42 the theory will run to an infra - red fixed point before triggering chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the lower boundary of the conformal window is thus identified by demanding @xmath43 .    for the fermions transforming under @xmath28 to break the ew symmetry at @xmath14",
    "they must be charged under the ew gauge group .",
    "the minimal choice ( dictated also by constraints from ew precision measurements @xcite ) is @xmath44 dirac flavors with the left - handed weyl spinors arranged in an @xmath45 weak doublet @xmath46 , along with @xmath29 sm singlet dirac flavors @xmath47 : @xmath48 the condensate @xmath49 breaks ew symmetry and the tbs are made out of the @xmath50s and @xmath51s while the dark matter candidate @xmath3 is made of the @xmath47s ( and is a fermion or boson depending on @xmath52 ) .",
    "the unbroken global symmetries of the tc interactions ( depending on @xmath53 ) keep @xmath3 stable and are discussed further below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the conformal phase - diagram in the @xmath54 plane , as well as the corresponding scale separation , with @xmath29 taking the value along the lower boundary of the conformal window .",
    "it is seen that we _ can not _ achieve large scale separations without having to increase @xmath29 ( _ i.e. _ reduce @xmath55 ) to values where the theory is actually ir - conformal .",
    "below @xmath14 , where the @xmath28 fermions decouple , the coupling simply runs too fast .",
    "gauge theories with @xmath56 fermions in the fundamental representation ( @xmath57 ) , and 2 flavours in the ( top to bottom ) : fundamental ( dark blue ) , two - index antisymmetric ( light blue ) , two - index symmetric ( red ) , and adjoint ( green ) representations .",

    "e.g. _ when embedding the technicolour gauge group in an extended technicolour ( etc ) gauge group @xcite , which is required to communicate ew breaking to the sm fermions without introducing fundamental scalars .",
    "it is assumed to break at some high scale @xmath58 , so in integrating out the heavy etc gauge bosons , four - fermion vector currents appear at the tc scale .",
    "this can also alleviate the tension with the @xmath59-parameter @xcite .",
    "four - fermion operators can also be induced by the non - perturbative dynamics of walking technicolour itself @xcite .",
    "we adopt the gauged njl model @xcite as a representative simple theory with four - fermion interactions which leads to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "while the four - fermion operator coupling is of the form @xmath60 here ( where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote vector and axial vector currents ) , the relation between chiral symmetry breaking on the one hand and the gauge and four - fermion coupling on the other hand is qualitatively the same in other cases as well .",
    "the gauged njl model for the fermions @xmath63 transforming under @xmath28 is defined by @xmath64 ,        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 the dimensionless four - fermion coupling and @xmath66 the effective cut - off of the the njl model . the critical line in the @xmath67-plane is now given by @xcite : @xmath68 the critical gauge coupling is thus reduced and in the limit @xmath69 , chiral symmetry breaking is driven purely by the four - fermion interaction .",
    "the lower boundary of the conformal window , found by imposing @xmath70 , now changes @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the case of @xmath71 gauge theories with @xmath44 and @xmath28 in different representations .",
    "it is seen how the conformal window shrinks as @xmath72 , allowing the addition of more matter transforming under @xmath30 while still having a theory that breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "[ fig2 ] also shows that the scale separation @xmath73 can now be substantial .     , but now as a function of @xmath65 ( [ njlcomeon ] ) . here",
    "the fundamental and antisymmetric representations are identical.,title=\"fig : \" ] , but now as a function of @xmath65 ( [ njlcomeon ] ) . here the fundamental and antisymmetric representations are identical.,title=\"fig : \" ]    although we have used rather simple approximations , this shows qualitatively how a significant scale separation can be achieved within a single strongly interacting theory .",
    "other dynamical frameworks may allow large scale separations _",
    "e.g. _ models with fundamental scalars which condense at @xmath14 and thereby have a similar effect to four - fermion operators .",
    "another possibility is chiral gauge theories where some fermions and some gauge bosons condense at @xmath14 resulting in a slowly evolving coupling below @xmath14 and a large scale separation .",
    "the phenomenology will depend on the specific tc gauge group and the fermion representations breaking ew symmetry , but there are some generic implications .",
    "if @xmath74 ( both complex ) , there is a single global @xmath75 keeping @xmath3 stable .",
    "we then expect to have a sizeable yukawa - type interaction between the heavy technibaryon tb , the dark matter particle @xmath3 and _ e.g_. the composite higgs which would keep the tb and @xmath3 particles in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "however if @xmath76 , additional global @xmath77 s in the theory can prevent such operators from arising ; in that case we would require additional interactions such as etc breaking these @xmath77 s such that only the technibaryon in the low scale sector remains stable @xcite ; an interesting example of interactions allowing this has been given @xcite .",
    "we discuss explicit models elsewhere but comment here on the implications for dark matter detection experiments .",
    "the symmetric component of @xmath3 can effectively annihilate into states which do not carry the @xmath15 ( _ e.g. _ technipions ) and can subsequently decay to sm states .",
    "the asymmetric component of @xmath3 can not annihilate so there are no indirect signatures ( since decays are highly suppressed compared to tev scale adm @xcite ) .",
    "we expect isospin-0 scalar and vector mesons like a ` techni - sigma ' ( or composite higgs ) and a ` techni - omega ' in both sectors .",
    "the ` techni - omega ' will mix with the sm hypercharge field after ew symmetry breaking and induce couplings of @xmath3 to the sm sector , just as we expect the ` techni - sigma ' to couple to sm fermions via effective yukawa couplings ( induced _ e.g. _ by etc ) .",
    "this can lead to exciting signals at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the spin - idependent elastic scattering cross - section on nucleons from either scalar or vector boson exchange is @xmath78 which is @xmath79 @xmath10 for a mediator mass of @xmath80 gev , a reduced mass @xmath81 gev and a coupling @xmath82 between @xmath3 and the mediator .",
    "the coupling @xmath83 arises from mixing between the light and heavy states , thus parametrically @xmath84 , and in addition it is proportional to small couplings  the @xmath85 coupling @xmath86 and fermion hypercharges in the ` techni - omega ' case , and the light sm fermion yukawa couplings in the composite higgs case .",
    "hence we expect @xmath87 , so the cross - section is within reach of direct detection experiments which are sensitive to nuclear recoil energies of @xmath88(kev ) characteristic of @xmath0 gev adm .    while pngb s themselves may carry @xmath15 @xcite and provide another way of generating light adm in simple models of dynamical ew symmetry breaking , their self - interactions are derivatively suppressed at low energies .",
    "by contrast , the ` dark baryon ' adm state @xmath3 considered here is expected to have large self - interactions and thus interesting astrophysical signatures @xcite .",
