    "mode identification is very important for the asteroseismic study of pulsation stars . for a rotating star ,",
    "the regularities due to rotational splitting in observed frequencies help us much to identify their spherical harmonic degree @xmath40 and azimuthal number @xmath41 . based on the rotational splitting law of g modes , we successfully disentangled the frequency spectra of the @xmath28 scuti star hd 50844 ( chen et al .",
    "2016 ) . that motivates us to analyze another @xmath28 scuti star corot 102749568 with the same method . in section 2",
    ", we propose our mode identification by means of rotational splitting . in section 3",
    ", we describe the details of input physics and model calculations .",
    "input physics are described in section 3.1 , model grids are elaborated in section 3.2 , and the optimal model are analyzed in section 3.3 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 , and summarize the results in section 5 .",
    "a pulsation mode is characterized by three indices , i.e. , the radial order @xmath42 , the spherical harmonic degree @xmath40 , and the azimuthal number @xmath41 ( christensen - dalsgaard 2003 ) .",
    "the azimuthal number @xmath41 are degenerate for a spherically symmetric star .",
    "namely , modes with the same @xmath42 and @xmath40 but different @xmath41 have the same frequency .",
    "stellar rotation will break the structure of spherical symmetry and result in frequency splitting , i.e. , one nonradial pulsation frequency will spilt into @xmath43 different frequencies . according to the theory of stellar oscillation , a general formula for rotational splitting",
    "is described as ( aerts et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath44 in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath45 is the rotational parameter measuring the size of rotational splitting and @xmath46 the rotational period . for high - degree or high - order p modes ,",

    ", we analyze the frequency spectra of corot 102749568 and list possible multiplets in table 2 .",
    "it can be noticed in table 2 that we find twenty - one sets of multiplets , including three different types of rotational spliting .",
    "the averaged frequency splitting @xmath51 is 4.451 @xmath52hz for multiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the averaged frequency splitting @xmath53 is 7.453 @xmath52hz for multiplet 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , and the averaged frequency splitting @xmath54 is 8.176 @xmath52hz for multiplet 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , and 21 . for these frequency differences in table 2 , we find that some of them approximate to the corresponding averaged value @xmath51 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 ( e.g. , miltiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 ) , and some of them are several times that of the corresponding average value ( e.g. , multiplet 4 , 11 , 12 , and 13 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the ratio of @xmath51 : @xmath53 : @xmath54 is 0.597 : 1.0 : 1.097 , which agrees well with the property of g modes . as shown in figure 1 , the @xmath28 scuti star corot 102749568 is in the post - main - sequence evolution stage with a contracting helium core and an expanding envelope .",
    "such stellar structure may reproduce these behaviors of rotational splitting .",
    "based on the property of rotational splitting for g modes , we identify frequencies in multiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 as @xmath0 modes , frequencies in multiplet 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 as @xmath1 modes , and frequencies in multiplet 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , and 21 as @xmath2 modes .",
    "furthermore , we find that the azimuthal number @xmath41 of pulsation modes in multiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 13 can be uniquely identified , and the azimuthal number @xmath41 of pulsation modes in other multiplets allow of several possibilities ( e.g. , three possibilities for pulsation modes in multiplet 5 ) .    finally , there are three unidentified frequencies @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , which do not show frequency splitting .",
    "frequencies @xmath55 and @xmath3 have a difference of 29.789 @xmath52hz , about four times that of @xmath58 .",
    "however , @xmath3 has been regarded as one component of multiplet 1 .",
    "multiplet 1 consists of three components , being a complete triplet .",
    "frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a difference of 4.485 @xmath52hz , which agree well with the difference 4.399 @xmath52hz between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . besides , modes with lower degree @xmath40 are easier to be observed because of the effect of geometrical cancellation .",
    "frequencies @xmath59 and @xmath56 have a difference of 48.847 @xmath52hz , about six times that of @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the frequency @xmath59 has been identified as one component of multiplet 14 .",
    "frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 have a difference 29.712 @xmath52hz , about four times that of @xmath58 .",
    "frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath57 have a difference of 40.597 @xmath52hz , about five times that of @xmath60 .",
    "the spherical harmonic degree of @xmath61 allows of two possibilities , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "for the former case , the azimuthal number @xmath41 of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are determined to be @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "this case is listed in table 2 .",
    "the azimuthal number of the latter case allows of two possibilities , i.e. , @xmath63 @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "based on the above analyses , the detection of triplets , quintuplets , and septuplets helps us to identify four sets of multiplets with @xmath0 , nine sets of multiplets with @xmath1 , and eight sets of multiplets with @xmath2 .",
    "owing to the deviations from the asymptotic expression , we find in table 2 that slight differences of the rotational splitting exist in different multiplets ( e.g. , in multiplet 8 and 9 ) .",
    "besides , slight differences also exist in the same multiplet ( e.g. , in multiplet 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find in table 2 that there are only two components in multiplet 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , and 21 .",
    "different physical origins are also possible , such as the large separation led by the so - called island modes ( garca hernndez et al .",
    "2013 ; lignires et al . 2006 ) and the phenomenon of avoided crossings ( aizenman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the @xmath28 scuti star corot 102749568 is a slightly evolved star , the occurrence of avoided crossings will make the frequency spectra more complex . from the observed frequency spectra of corot 102749568 , it is difficult to find the signs of avoided crossings .",
    "hence the phenomenon of avoided crossings is not considered in our work .",
    "all of our theoretical models are computed with the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) , which is developed by paxton et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "we use the so - called module pulse from version 6596 to calculate stellar evolutionary models and their corresponding pulsation frequencies ( christensen - dalsgaard 2008 ; paxton et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 )    in our calculations , the opal opacity table gs98 ( grevesse @xmath32 sauval 1998 ) series are adopted .",
    "we use the @xmath67 relation of eddington grey atmosphere in the atmosphere integration , and choose the mixing - length theory ( mlt ) of b@xmath68hm - vitense ( 1958 ) to treat convection . based on numerical calculations , we find that theoretical evolutionary models are not sensitive to the mixing - length parameter .",
    "however , the values of @xmath45 of theoretical models with slightly higher @xmath69 agree better with asymptotic values of g modes , hence @xmath69 = 2.2 is adopted in our work .",
    "moreover , we find that theoretical models without convective core overshooting can not reproduce those observed multiplets . hence we introduce the convective core overshooting in our calculations .. for the overshooting mixing of the convective core , we adopt an exponentially decaying prescription . following freytag et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and herwig ( 2000 ) , we introduce an overshoot mixing diffusion coefficient @xmath70 in equation ( 2 ) , @xmath71 is the convective mixing coefficient , @xmath72 the distance into radiative zone away from the boundary of convective core , @xmath73 the pressure scale height , and @xmath21 an adjustable parameter describing the efficiency of the overshooting mixing . in our calculations , we set the lower limit of the diffusion coefficient @xmath74 @xmath75 , below which no element mixing is allowed .",
    "in addition , effects of rotation and element diffusion are not considered in our work .",
    "the internal structure and the evolutionary track of a star depend on the initial mass @xmath19 , the initial chemical composition @xmath76 , and the overshooting parameters @xmath21 .",
    "a grid of theoretical models are computed with mesa , @xmath19 varying from 1.5 @xmath16 to 2.2 @xmath16 with a step of 0.01 @xmath16 , @xmath77 varying from 0.005 to 0.030 with a step of 0.001 , and @xmath21 varying from 0 to 0.016 with a step of 0.001 . in our calculations , we choose the initial helium fraction @xmath78 ( e.g. , dotter et al .",
    "2008 ; thompson et al . 2014 ; tian et al . 2015 ) as a function of mass fraction of heavy - elements @xmath77 .",
    "theoretical models for each star are computed from the zero - age main sequence to post - main - sequence stage .",
    "the error box in figure 1 corresponds to the observed stellar parameters , i.e. , the effective temperature 6800 k @xmath79 @xmath23 @xmath79 7200 k and the gravitational acceleration 3.50 @xmath79 log@xmath31 @xmath79 4.00 .",
    "we calculate frequencies of oscillation modes with @xmath40 = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 for every stellar model which falls inside the error box along the evolutionary track .",
    "we try to use theoretical oscillation frequencies derived from a grid of evolutionary models to fit those of identified pulsation modes . according to the analyses in section 2 , mode identifications are unique only in multiplet 1 , 2 , and 3 and their @xmath80 components",
    "are observed .",
    "when doing model fittings , we hence use four identified pulsation modes , i.e. , three @xmath0 modes ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath10 ) and the radial first overtone @xmath13 .",

    "shows the plot of @xmath85 to the effective temperature @xmath23 for all theoretical models .",
    "each curve in figure 2 corresponds to one theoretical evolutionary track . in figure 2",
    ", the filled circles correspond to seven candidate models of corot 102749568 in table 3 .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard ( 2003 ) defines the general expression of the rotational parameter @xmath45 of a pulsation mode for a rigid body as @xmath86 where the subscripts `` @xmath87 '' and `` @xmath88 '' correspond to the radial displacement and the horizontal displacement , @xmath89 denotes the local density , and @xmath90 .",
    "based on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions of high - order g modes , @xmath45 can be simplified as being the asymptotic value @xmath91 . according to asymptotic value of g modes , @xmath92 = 0.5 , @xmath93 = 0.833 , and @xmath94 = 0.917 .",
    "for the three identified @xmath0 modes @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath10 , their corresponding @xmath45 of these candidate modes are listed in table 4 . in table 4 ,",

    "it can be found in table 4 that theoretical values of @xmath45 for model 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 significantly deviate from those asymptotic values of g modes .",
    "we therefore exclude these four models from our considerations .",
    "the physical parameters of corot 102749568 are obtained based on model 4 , 5 , and 6 .",

    "moreover , we find that @xmath45 of corresponding @xmath80 components in multiplet 13 are slightly larger than the asymptotic value from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "these results also proves that our approach of mode identification based on the rotational splitting of g modes is self - consistent .",
    "finally , we try to do mode identification for the three isolated pulsation frequencies based on the optimal model , and list them in table 8 .",

    "it can be found in table 3 that @xmath104 and @xmath105 of the three preferred models ( model 4 , 5 , and 6 ) are very close .",

    "rotation results in an increase in the convective core size for stars with @xmath19 @xmath130 2.05 @xmath16 .",
    "the effect is similar to that of the convective core overshooting .",

    "( 2013 ) , rotation will result in a slight decrease in the convective core size .",
    "if the effects of rotation are included in theoretical evolutionary models , a larger convective core overshooting may be indispensable .",
