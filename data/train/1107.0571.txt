    "@xmath7 is a delay term satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the initial data is independent of the wiener measure driving the equations and @xmath11 is an @xmath12-dimensional wiener process defined on the complete probability space @xmath13 with a filtration @xmath14 satisfying the usual conditions ( that is , it is increasing and right continuous while @xmath15 contains all @xmath16-null sets ) .    for a given constant stepsize @xmath17 , we propose a split - step backward euler ( ssbe ) method for sddes ( [ sddes1 ] ) as follows    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and for @xmath21 @xmath22 for arbitrary stepsize @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the approximation of @xmath25 at time @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that @xmath27 in ( [ y*n ] ) depends on how memory values are handled on non - grid points .",
    "generally there are two ways , the first is to use piecewise constant interpolation , corresponding to @xmath28 , and the second to use piecewise linear interpolation . in later development , we prefer to assume @xmath29 to cover both cases . also , we mention that the scheme ( [ ssbe1])-([ssbe2 ] ) here is quite different from the ssbe method in @xcite , which will be explained at the end of this section .    in ( [ ssbe1])-([ssbe2 ] ) , @xmath30 serves as an intermediate stage value , and in order to continue the process , we have to solve the implicit equation ( [ ssbe1 ] ) at every step to acquire @xmath30 .",
    "existence and uniqueness of solutions to the implicit equations ( [ ssbe1 ] ) will be discussed in section 4 . here , we always assume that numerical solution of ( [ ssbe1 ] ) exists uniquely .",
    "and one can easily check that @xmath31 is @xmath32-measurable .",
    "the key aim in this work is to propose a new ssbe method for sddes with variable delay and its convergence and stability in mean - square sense are investigated under a non - globally lipschitz condition .",
    "this situation has been investigated in @xcite for stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) without delay . for sdes with delay ,",
    "most of previous work has been based on the more restrictive assumption that the coefficients @xmath33 satisfies global lipschitz and linear growth conditions , see , for example , @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that the numerical solution produced by euler - maruyama ( em ) method will converge to the true solution of the sddes under the local lipschitz condition .",
    "note that the proof of the convergence result in this paper is based on techniques used in @xcite . in @xcite , by interpreting the implicit method ssbe as the em applied to a modified sde the authors were able to get a strong convergence result .",
    "this paper , however , provides an alternative way to get the convergence result for ssbe .",
    "that is , by giving a direct continuous - time extension we accomplished the convergence proof for ssbe without considering the modified sddes .",
    "also , in deriving moment bounds of numerical solution , due to the delay term of our ssbe , i.e. , @xmath34 in ( [ ssbe1 ] ) , @xmath35 can not be explicitly dominated by @xmath24 as ( 3.25 ) in @xcite . starting with a recurrence of @xmath35 given by substituting ( [ ssbe2 ] ) into ( [ ssbe1 ] )",
    ", we overcome this difficulty and obtained the desired moment bounds .",
    "note that a similar approach is adopted in the stability analysis .",
    "of course , the most important contribution of this work is to propose an improved ssbe method for sddes and to verify its excellent stability property . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a ssbe method for a linear scalar sdde with constant lag and its convergence and stability are studied there .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our proposed method is a modified version of ssbe in @xcite .",
    "the changes are in two aspects : firstly , we drop the stepsize restriction @xmath36 and allow for arbitrary stepsize @xmath17 ; secondly and most importantly , the scheme has been modified to a new one . to see this ,",
    "the two methods are applied to a linear scalar sdde in section [ linear_ms ] .",
    "one can observe that the second terms of @xmath33 in the scheme in @xcite is the numerical solution @xmath37 ( see ( [ ssbez ] ) below ) . while the corresponding terms in our scheme is the intermediate stage value @xmath38 ( see ( [ ssbew ] ) below ) .",
    "note that the modifications of the method do not raise the strong order of the numerical solution , but they indeed improve the stability of the method greatly .",
    "in fact , it is shown below that our method can well replicate exponential mean - square stability of nonlinear test problem , including the linear test equation as a special case , without any restrictions on stepsize @xmath4 .",
    "the convergence and stability results of ssbe can be regarded as an extension of those in @xcite for sdes without delay to variable delay case .",
    "this unconditional stability property of ( [ ssbe1])-([ssbe2 ] ) demonstrates that the proposed method is promising and will definitely be effective in solving systems with stiffness in the drift term , where stability investigations are particularly important .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", a general convergence result ( theorem [ ssbemain ] ) is established . in section 3",
    ", a convergence result is derived under a one - sided lipschitz condition ( assumption [ olc ] ) .",

    "numerical experiments are included in section 6 .",
    "throughout the paper , let @xmath39 denote both the euclidean norm in @xmath40 and the trace norm(f - norm ) in @xmath41 .",
    "as the standing hypotheses , we make the following assumption .",
    "[ lcmc ] the system ( [ sddes1 ] ) has a unique solution @xmath25 on @xmath42 $ ] .",

    "moreover , we assume that @xcite    [ init ] @xmath47 is hlder continuous in mean - square with exponent 1/2 , that is @xmath48 and @xmath7 is a continuous function satisfying @xmath49    in the following convergence analysis , we find it convenient to use continuous - time approximation solution .",
    "hence we define continuous version @xmath50 as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 . for @xmath53 we can write it in integral form as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 it is not hard to verify that @xmath56 , that is , @xmath50 coincides with the discrete solutions at the grid - points .    in additional to the above two assumptions , we will need another one .",
