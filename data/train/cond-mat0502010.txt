    "quantum statistics for bosons and fermions lies in the basis of our understanding of many - body physics . in the case of a dilute gas of bosons ,",
    "one faces the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , a macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state below a certain critical temperature , predicted by s. bose and a. einstein in 1924 @xcite .",
    "the idea of bec originally comes from the analogy between light and matter waves .",
    "indeed , at sufficiently low temperatures the de broglie wavelength of particles exceeds the mean inter - particle separation , and the wave packets of particles start overlapping .",
    "then the quantum statistics comes into play and it becomes favorable for bosons to occupy a single quantum state .",
    "this state represents a macroscopic quantum object called bose - einstein condensate , and the formation of the condensate manifests itself as a phase transition accompanied by a change of some of the properties of the gas .    since the work of bose @xcite and einstein @xcite , a number of phenomena in interacting systems have been considered as manifestations of bec : superfluidity in liquid helium , high-@xmath0 superconductivity in some materials , condensation of hypothetical higgs particles , bec of pions , and so on .",
    "bose - einstein condensation in dilute gases has been first observed in 1995 in pioneering experiments with clouds of magnetically trapped alkali atoms at jila @xcite , mit @xcite , and rice @xcite .",
    "the first generation of studies of trapped bose - condensed gases found a variety of spectacular macroscopic quantum effects : interference between two condensates , collective oscillations and their damping , formation of quantized vortices and vortex lattices , atom lasers , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for review ) .    in the last few years",
    ", the field of quantum gases is strongly expanding in the direction of ultracold two - component clouds of fermionic atoms , with the initial goal of achieving a superfluid bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase transition .",
    "this transition requires attractive interaction between the atoms .",
    "then , in the simplest version of the superfluid transition , at sufficiently low temperatures fermions belonging to different components and having opposite momenta on the fermi surface form correlated ( cooper ) pairs in the momentum space .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a gap in the excitation spectrum and to the phenomenon of superfluidity ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in a dilute ultracold two - component fermi gas ,",
    "most efficient is the formation of cooper pairs due to the attractive intercomponent interaction in the s - wave channel ( negative @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , for ordinary values of @xmath2 , the superfluid transition temperature is extremely low .",
    "for this reason , the efforts of experimental groups have been focused on modifying the intercomponent interaction by using feshbach resonances ( see below ) . in this case",
    ", one can switch the sign and tune the absolute value of @xmath2 , which at resonance changes from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this has led to remarkable developments , in particular to the creation of weakly bound diatomic molecules of fermionic atoms on the positive side of the resonance ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "these are the largest diatomic molecules obtained so far .",
    "their size is of the order of @xmath2 and it reaches hundreds of nanometers in current experiments .",
    "accordingly , their binding energy is exceedingly small ( @xmath6 ev or less ) .",
    "being composite bosons , these molecules obey bose statistics , and they have been bose - condensed in jila experiments with @xmath7k@xmath8 @xcite and in @xmath9li@xmath8 experiments at innsbruck @xcite , mit @xcite , ens @xcite , and rice @xcite .    nevertheless , some of the interaction properties of these molecules reflect fermi statistics of the individual atoms forming the molecule . in particular , these molecules are found remarkably stable with respect to collisional decay .",
    "being in the highest rovibrational state , they do not undergo collisional relaxation to deeply bound states on a time scale exceeding seconds at densities of about @xmath10 @xmath11 , which is more than four orders of magnitude longer than the life time of similar molecules consisting of bosonic atoms .",
    "currently , a new generation of experiments is being set up for studying degenerate mixtures of different fermionic atoms , where one expects the formation of heteronuclear weakly bound molecules . in this paper",
    "we analyze elastic interaction between these molecules and their collisional relaxation to deeply bound states .",
    "the emphasis is put on the dependence of these properties on the mass ratio for the constituent atoms and on the comparison of the results with those for presently studied homonuclear molecules .",
    "we present a physical picture of how such composite bosons can exhibit features of fermi statistics and show that this is the reason for their collisional stability .",
    "the studies of interacting quantum gases are actively pursued using feshbach resonances , in particular for tuning and increasing the intercomponent interaction in two - species fermi gases . in the vicinity of the resonance , for the two - particle problem one",
    "has a strong coupling between ( zero - energy ) continuum states of colliding atoms and a bound molecular state of another hyperfine manifold .",
    "the effective coupling strength depends on the detuning from the resonance ( the energy difference @xmath12 between the bound molecular state and the continuum states ) , which can be varied by changing the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the scattering length becomes field dependent ( see fig .  1 ) .        at resonance the scattering length changes from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and in the vicinity of the resonance one has the inequality @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the gas then is in the strongly interacting regime",
    ". it is still dilute and the mean interparticle separation greatly exceeds the characteristic radius of interparticle interaction @xmath15 . however , the amplitude of binary interactions ( scattering length ) is larger than the mean separation between particles , and the ordinary mean field approach is no longer valid .    for a large detuning from resonance",
    "the gas is still in the weakly interacting regime , i.e. the inequality @xmath16 is satisfied , where @xmath17 is the density of the gas . on the negative side of the resonance ( @xmath18 ) , at sufficiently low temperatures of a two - component atomic fermi gas one",
    "expects the bcs pairing between distinguishable fermions , well described in literature @xcite . on the positive side ( @xmath19 ) two fermions belonging to different components form weakly bound molecules . the collisional stability and bose - einstein condensation of these molecules is a subtle question , and it is the main topic of this paper .    the idea of resonance coupling through a feshbach resonance for achieving a superfluid phase transition in ultracold two - component fermi gases has been proposed in refs .",
    "the crossover from the bcs to bec behavior attracts now a great deal of interest , in particular with respect to the nature of superfluid pairing , transition temperature , and elementary excitations .",
    "it is worth noting that this type of crossover has been discussed in literature in the context of superconductivity @xcite and in relation to superfluidity in two - dimensional films of @xmath20he @xcite .",
    "the description of a many - body system near a feshbach resonance requires a detailed knowledge of the 2-body problem .",
    "this is a two - channel problem which can be described in terms of the breit - wigner scattering @xcite , the open channel being the states of colliding atoms and the closed channel the bound molecular state of the other hyperfine domain .",
    "various aspects of this type of problems have been discussed by feshbach @xcite and fano @xcite . in cold atom physics",
    "the idea of feshbach resonances was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and optically induced resonances have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two - body physics is the most transparent if one can omit the ( small ) background scattering length .",
    "then for low collision energies @xmath21 the scattering amplitude is given by @xcite : @xmath22 where the quantity @xmath23 characterizes the coupling between the two hyperfine domains and @xmath24 is the reduced mass of the two atoms .",
    "the scattering length is @xmath25 . in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) the detuning @xmath12 is positive if the bound molecular state is below the continuum of colliding atoms .",
    "then for @xmath26 the scattering length is positive , and for @xmath27 it is negative . introducing a characteristic length @xmath28 and expressing the scattering amplitude through the relative momentum of particles @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) takes the form : @xmath30 the validity of eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) does not require the inequality @xmath31 .",
    "at the same time , this equation formally coincides with the amplitude of scattering of slow particles by a potential with the same scattering length @xmath2 and an effective range @xmath32 , obtained under the condition @xmath33 .",
    "the length @xmath34 is an intrinsic parameter of the feshbach resonance problem .",
    "it characterizes the width of the resonance . from eqs .",
    "( [ fe ] ) and ( [ rw ] ) we see that large @xmath35 and , hence , small @xmath34 correspond to a wide resonance , whereas small @xmath35 and large @xmath34 lead to a narrow resonance . the issue of wide and narrow resonances is now actively discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , the use of the terms `` wide '' and `` narrow '' depends on the problem under consideration .",
    "for example , in the unitarity limit where @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) shows that the length @xmath34 drops out of the problem under the condition @xmath37 . in a quantum degenerate fermi gas",
    "the characteristic momentum of particles is the fermi momentum @xmath38 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath34 the condition of the wide resonance depends on the gas density @xmath17 and takes the form @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "then the scattering properties of the gas are the same as in the case of potential scattering at an infinite scattering length .    for @xmath19 and @xmath40 ,",
    "where one has a weakly interacting gas of diatomic bosonic molecules @xcite , the criterion of the wide resonance is different @xcite .",
    "the most important limitation is related to the binding energy and the wavefunction of the molecules . the energy of the weakly bound molecular state ( it is certainly assumed that the characteristic radius of interaction @xmath41 ) is determined by the pole of the scattering amplitude ( [ fk ] ) .",
    "one then finds @xcite that this state exists only for @xmath19 and under the condition @xmath42 the binding energy is given by @xmath43 then the wavefunction of the weakly bound molecular state has only a small admixture of the closed channel , the size of the molecule is @xmath44 , and atom - molecule and molecule - molecule interactions are determined by a single parameter  the atom - atom scattering length @xmath2 . in this sense ,",
    "the problem becomes universal .",
    "it is equivalent to the interaction problem for the two - body potential which is characterized by a large positive scattering length @xmath2 and has a potential well with a weakly bound molecular state .",
    "the picture remains the same when the background scattering length @xmath45 can not be neglected , although the condition of a wide resonance can be somewhat modified @xcite .",
    "experimental studies are currently dealing with fermi gases consisting of atoms in two different internal ( hyperfine ) states and , accordingly , having equal masses .",
    "most experiments use wide feshbach resonances .",
    "for example , weakly bound molecules @xmath9li@xmath8 and @xmath7k@xmath8 have been produced in experiments @xcite by using feshbach resonances with a length @xmath34 of the order of or smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "then , for the achieved values of the scattering length @xmath2 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , the ratio @xmath49 is smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "the only exception is the experiment at rice with @xmath9li near a narrow feshbach resonance at 543 g @xcite . for this resonance",
    "the length @xmath34 is very large and at obtained values of @xmath2 the condition ( [ ra ] ) is not fulfilled .",
    "below we will focus attention on the case of a wide feshbach resonance .",
    "at temperatures sufficiently lower than the molecular binding energy @xmath51 and for equal concentrations of the two atomic components , practically all atoms are converted into molecules if the gas density satisfies the inequality @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this will be definitely the case at temperatures well below the fermi energy ( the least of the two fermi energies in the case of atoms with different masses ) .",
    "thus , one has a molecular bose gas and the first key question is the elastic interaction ( scattering ) between the molecules .",
    "it is important for evaporative cooling of the molecular gas to the regime of bose - einstein condensation and for the stability of the condensate . in the latter respect ,",
    "the elastic interaction should be repulsive , otherwise the bose - condensed molecular gas undergoes a collapse .",
    "the exact solution for the molecule - molecule elastic scattering in the case of equal atom masses was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a detailed analysis of this problem was given in ref .",
    "this was done assuming that the ( positive ) atom - atom scattering length @xmath2 for the interspecies interaction greatly exceeds the characteristic radius of interatomic potential : @xmath52 then , as in the case of the 3-body problem with fermions @xcite , the amplitude of elastic interaction is determined only by @xmath2 and can be found in the zero - range approximation for the interatomic potential .",
    "this approach was introduced in the two - body physics by bethe and peierls @xcite .",
    "the leading idea is to solve the equation for the free relative motion of two particles placing a boundary condition on the wavefunction @xmath53 at a vanishing interparticle distance @xmath54 : @xmath55 which can also be rewritten as @xmath56 one then gets a correct expression for the wavefunction at distances @xmath57 .",
    "for the case where @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ boundary1 ] ) gives a correct result for the wavefunction of weakly bound and continuum states even at distances much smaller than @xmath2 .    in this section",
    "we generalize the results on the molecule - molecule scattering obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of molecules consisting of fermionic atoms with different masses @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is relevant for weakly bound heteronuclear molecules , such as @xmath9li-@xmath7k , @xmath9li-@xmath62sr , @xmath7k-@xmath63yb etc .",
    ", which can be formed by sweeping across a feshbach resonance for the interspecies interaction .",
    "elastic interaction between such molecules is important for understanding the physics of their bose - einstein condensation and for studying the bcs - bec cross - over in fermi mixtures .    the ultracold limit for the molecule - molecule scattering is realized under the condition @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the relative momentum .",
    "this is because @xmath2 is approximately the range of interaction between the molecules . in this case",
    "the scattering is dominated by the contribution of the @xmath1-wave channel .",

    "the analysis in the previous section also holds for collisional relaxation of weakly bound molecules of heavy and light fermionic atoms ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the most efficient is again the relaxation process in which one light and two heavy fermions approach each other to distances @xmath147 , and the fourth ( light ) atom is separated from this three - body system by a large distance @xmath44 .",
    "however , for a large mass ratio the behavior of the three - body system of one light and two heavy atoms changes , and the physical picture of the relaxation process is drastically modified . when the heavy atoms are separated from each other by a distance @xmath140 ,",
    "the light atom mediates an effective @xmath194 attraction between them .",
    "this follows from the efimov picture of effective interaction in a three - body system @xcite and can be illustrated in the born - oppenheimer approximation , relying on the results in sec .",
    "[ sec.bo ] @xcite . for @xmath140 ,",
    "the light atom is in the bound state `` + '' with two heavy atoms , and from eqs .",
    "( [ bo.lambda ] ) , ( [ epsilon ] ) we then obtain an effective potential @xmath195 .",
    "this attraction competes with the pauli principle which in terms of effective interaction manifests itself in the centrifugal @xmath194 repulsion between the heavy atoms .",
    "the presence of this repulsion is clearly seen from the fact that in the state `` + '' the permutation of the heavy fermions does not change the sign of the light - atom wavefunction @xmath196 given by eq.([bo.boundstatelight ] ) .",
    "hence , the total wavefunction of the three - body system @xmath197 is antisymmetric with respect to this permutation only if the wavefunction of the relative motion of heavy atoms @xmath198 changes its sign .",
    "therefore , @xmath198 contains partial waves with odd angular momenta , and for the lowest angular momentum ( @xmath174-wave ) the centrifugal barrier is @xmath199 . for comparable masses",
    "it is significantly stronger than @xmath118 .",
    "thus , we have the physical picture of the previous section : the pauli principle ( centrifugal barrier ) reduces the probability for the atoms to be at short distances and , as a consequence , the relaxation rate decreases with increasing the atom - atom scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "the role of the effective attraction increases with @xmath110 . as a result ,",

    "the exponent @xmath1 continuously decreases with increasing @xmath110 and becomes zero for @xmath200 . in the born - oppenheimer picture",

    "[ sec.elastic ] , in this case the shape of the wavefunction at distances of the order of @xmath15 can significantly influence the large - scale behavior and a short - range three - body parameter is required to describe the system .",
    "the fact that for @xmath205 the relaxation rate is not decreasing with an increase in the atom - atom scattering length @xmath2 , does not mean that the relaxation is not reduced compared to the case of molecules of bosonic atoms with the same mass ratio . for a large @xmath110 , at distances @xmath134 larger than @xmath2",
    "the molecules interact via a strong repulsive potential @xmath118 given by eq .",
    "( [ ueff ] ) . away from possible resonances in molecule - molecule collisions ,",
    "this barrier reduces the amplitude of the wavefunction at intermolecular distances @xmath44 and , hence , leads to a suppression of the relaxation rate . estimating the corresponding tunneling probability @xmath206 in the wkb approach , we obtain @xmath207 where the coefficient @xmath208 is of order unity .",
    "we thus see that one also expects the suppression of collisional relaxation for weakly bound molecules of light and heavy fermionic atoms . however , the suppression factor is independent of the atom - atom scattering length @xmath2 and is governed by the mass ratio @xmath110 .",
    "the mechanism of this suppression originates from fermi statistics for the light atoms , which leads to a strong repulsion between molecules at large intermolecular distances .",
    "this result should have implications for experiments on the formation of molecules in mixtures of @xmath9li with much heavier fermionic atoms , for example @xmath62sr ( @xmath209 ) or @xmath63yb ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "the suppression of the relaxation decay rate of weakly bound molecules of fermionic atoms has a crucial con- sequence for the physics of these molecules . at realistic temperatures",
    "the relaxation rate constant @xmath211 is much smaller than the rate constant of elastic collisions @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the thermal velocity .",
    "for example , for the li@xmath8 weakly bound molecules at a temperature @xmath214k and @xmath215 , the corresponding ratio is of the order of @xmath216 or @xmath217 .",
    "this opens wide possibilities for reaching bec of the molecules and cooling the bose - condensed gas to temperatures of the order of its chemical potential .",
    "long - lived bec of weakly bound molecules has been recently observed for @xmath7k@xmath218 at jila @xcite and for @xmath219li@xmath218 at innsbruck @xcite , mit @xcite , ens @xcite , and rice @xcite .",
    "measurements of the molecule - molecule scattering length confirm the result @xmath111 with accuracy up to 30% @xcite .",
    "this result is also confirmed by recent monte carlo calculations @xcite of the ground state energy in the molecular bec regime .",
    "remarkable achievements in the physics of ultracold fermi gases attract a lot of attention and draw fascinating prospects for future studies .",
    "the prospects are to a large extent related to a very long lifetime of weakly bound bosonic molecules of fermionic atoms , which allows interesting manipulations with these molecules . arranging a deep evaporative cooling of their bose - condensed gas to temperatures of the order of the chemical potential , one",
    "can then convert the molecular bec into fermionic atoms by adiabatically changing the scattering length to negative values .",
    "this provides an additional cooling , and the obtained atomic fermi gas will have extremely low temperatures @xmath220 which can be below the bcs transition temperature @xcite . at these temperatures",
    "one has a very strong pauli blocking of elastic collisions and expects the collisionless regime for the thermal cloud , which is promising for identifying the bcs - paired state through the observation of collective oscillations or free expansion @xcite .",
    "recent experiments at innsbruck , ens , jila and mit have explored the bec - bcs crossover regime and shown a remarkably reversible behavior of the gas from the bec region to the bcs region and back over duration of seconds @xcite .",
    "experiments have also measured the pairing gap in the crossover region using rf spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the energy gap varies between the binding energy of the molecules in the region @xmath19 , and a density dependent ( and much smaller ) value in the region @xmath18 where no stable two - body bound state exists .",
    "further experiments at jila and mit have proven that fermionic atom pairs present in the strongly correlated regime at @xmath18 behave as bose - condensed pairs @xcite .",
    "for revealing the nature of this superfluid pairing it is promising to make experiments with rotating fermi gases @xcite in the strongly interacting regime , where one expects the formation of vortices and vortex lattices @xcite .",
    "another idea is to look directly at a signature of the long range order in the superfluid phase by an interference experiment as suggested in @xcite",
    ".    it will also be interesting to transfer the weakly bound molecules of fermionic atoms to their ground ro - vibrational state by using two - photon spectroscopy , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for molecules of bosonic atoms",
    ". long lifetime of weakly bound molecules of fermionic atoms at densities @xmath145 @xmath11 should provide a much more efficient production of ground state molecules compared to the case of molecules of bosonic atoms , where one has severe limitations on achievable densities and lifetimes .",
    "one can then extensively study the physics of molecular bose - einstein condensation .",
    "moreover , heteronuclear molecules which are supposed to be formed in mixtures of different fermionic atoms , can be polarized by an electric field .",
