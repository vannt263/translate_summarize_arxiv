    "in the representation of a nucleus as a core and a nuclear molecule on the surface of the core the nuclear binding energies and the radii of @xmath1- stable isotopes are calculated @xcite .",
    "the calculations are made in the framework of an @xmath10-cluster model based on pn - pair interactions with using isospin invariance of nuclear force @xcite . in the framework of the model some parameters like the binding energy and the energy of coulomb repulsion between two nearby clusters had been found to be @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 mev , so that the nuclear force energy is to be @xmath13 mev @xcite as well as the energy of nuclear force of one @xmath10-cluster @xmath14 mev @xcite where @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev .",
    "one of the main findings @xcite of the phenomenological model is the formula for binding energy @xmath17 of the symmetrical nuclei @xmath18 with the number of @xmath0 - clusters @xmath19    @xmath20    for the odd @xmath21 nuclei the energy @xmath22 mev .",
    "it is suggested that the number of short range links in a nucleus consisting of @xmath23 @xmath10-clusters is @xmath24 and that the long range part of the coulomb interactions must be compensated with the surface tension energy @xmath25 .",
    "then with using isospin invariance of nuclear force the empirical values of the coulomb energy , the energy of surface tension and the empirical values of the distance of the position of the last alpha - cluster @xmath26 in the system of the center of the masses of the remote @xmath27 @xmath28-clusters have been obtained @xcite . from the analysis of these values the formulas for coulomb radius @xmath29fm ( see ( 22 ) @xcite ) , for the radius of the position of the last @xmath28-cluster @xmath30 fm ( see ( 21 ) @xcite ) have been found .",
    "the coulomb energy of the charge sphere of the radius @xmath31 is @xmath32 , which after simplifying is @xmath33 mev @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the excess nn - pairs for the beta - stable nuclei @xmath34 ( see ( 13 ) @xcite ) where @xmath35 is the binding energy of the @xmath36 nn - pair in the core .",
    "the nn - pairs fill out the free space in the core which appears due to the difference between the charge and the matter radii of an alpha - cluster .",
    "thus , the binding energy of all @xmath37 - stable nuclei with an accuracy in a few mev is calculated as the sum @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy of nuclear force in short range links ( see ( 7 ) @xcite ) .",
    "there is a clear relation between the nuclei @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is an even number and @xmath44 @xcite . then @xmath45 .",
    "the nuclei have equal cores with @xmath46 @xmath0 - clusters and with the same number of excess nn - pairs @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the peripheral molecule on the surface of the core consists of @xmath49 @xmath0 - clusters for the even nucleus and of @xmath49 + 0.5 for the odd nucleus . in case of the nucleus @xmath50 one neutron",
    "is stuck to the single pn - pair .",
    "it has been taken into account @xcite that the number of short range links in the core has to be @xmath51 + 6 , because the total number of links is @xmath52 .",
    "therefore the energy of six short range links @xmath53 is added to the binding energy of @xmath46 @xmath0 - clusters in calculation of the core binding energy .",
    "so the binding energies @xmath17 and @xmath54 of the nuclei @xmath55 and @xmath56 are calculated as follows , see ( 4,5)@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the experimental binding energies of the nuclei with the total number of alpha - clusters equal to @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( for example @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 is the energy of the coulomb interaction between the peripheral molecule and the core @xmath65 @xmath66 is the core binding energy @xmath67 where the binding energy of excess nn - pairs @xmath68 was approximated ( see ( 12 ) in @xcite ) with the following formula in dependence on the number of excess nn - pairs @xmath69",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71 stands for the binding energy of @xmath72 of core @xmath28-clusters @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; @xmath25 is the surface tension energy @xmath76 the original formula @xmath77 ( see ( 17 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as an approximation function to the factorized sum of the square radii of @xmath27 clusters for the nuclei with @xmath78 .",
    "the part @xmath79 is changed here for @xmath80 . in case",
    "when @xmath60=4 , eq .",
    "( 7 ) and the original one coincide .",
    "so all the formulas are from @xcite with one little change in the formula for the surface tension energy .    for the isotopes of the nuclei with @xmath81 the binding energy of the @xmath0-clusters",
    "is known from the energy of the symmetrical nuclei with @xmath82 ( 1 ) .",
    "so the binding energy for the isotopes is to be trivial @xmath83 .",
    "the energy can be written in the terms of core and a peripheral molecule ( 2 ) with @xmath84 .",
    "the energy e ( 2 ) for the cases almost does not depend on @xmath49 varied within 2 @xmath85 5 .",
    "two molecules on the surface of the core , let them consist of @xmath86 and @xmath87 alpha - clusters , are needed in describing the isotopes with a considerable deficiency of excess neutrons in the nuclei with big @xmath4 , see section 2 .",
    "then the binding energy is as follows @xcite @xmath88 for the odd nucleus @xmath56 to calculate @xmath54 one pn - pair is added to one of the molecules . here",
    "@xmath89 is exchanged for @xmath90 .",
    "the value @xmath66 is calculated by ( 4 ) with @xmath91 . unlike @xcite the total number of short links in the core",
    "does not depend on whether there is one or two molecules on the surface of the core .",
    "the following formulas ( 9 - 12 ) have been proposed to estimate radii of the nuclei @xmath55 on @xmath92 and the odd nuclei @xmath56 on @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the simplest one for @xmath94 is the following @xmath95 the core prevails in the cases , so the value @xmath96 is to be the charge radius of a core @xmath28-cluster . to define @xmath96 the empirical radii in @xcite , table iiia , with 116 data for the isotopes @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath97 have been fitted .",
    "the authors analyze the muonic atom transition energies with using the same model for all observed there isotopes for the nuclei with @xmath98 and 77 @xmath99 .",
    "the value @xmath100 fm has been obtained here with the rms deviation from the experimental data @xmath101 = 0.030 fm .",
    "for the 147 isotopes @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath102 of the table @xmath101 = 0.064 fm .    the charge radius for the nuclei with @xmath103 6 can be estimated from adding the volumes of the charges of the core and the peripheral molecule @xcite @xmath104 where the radius of a peripheral alpha - cluster @xmath105=1.71 fm .",
    "for the nuclei without core , i.e. with @xmath106 , @xmath107=0 .",
    "fitting the data of the table iiia @xcite for the isotopes with @xmath97 with the values @xmath60 , obtained from analysis of binding energies , see section 2 , ( @xmath108 in most of the cases ) , gives the value @xmath96 = 1.574 fm with @xmath109 = 0.033 fm .",
    "as for the isotopes with 12 @xmath110 23 we tried @xmath60= 5 , which means the nuclear molecule @xmath111ne for the even isotopes and @xmath112na for the odd isotopes . then for the 147 isotopes with @xmath113 of the table @xmath101 = 0.040 fm .    another way to calculate",
    "charge radii for the nuclei with @xmath103 6 is the following @xcite @xmath114 where the square core radius and the square distance of the position of the last @xmath28-cluster in the system of the center of mass of the core ( for the @xmath115 23 the empirical values @xmath116 are used , see ( 17 ) in @xcite ) are added with their weights to be equal to the square radius of the nucleus weighed with @xmath117 . in the cases when @xmath118 ( @xmath119 10 and @xmath49 = 5 ) the formula is rewritten for the center of mass of the peripheral molecule .",
    "then @xmath60 and @xmath107 exchange their places and @xmath96 is replaced with @xmath105 . the value @xmath120 = 1.595 fm obtained from fitting 116 data for the isotopes with @xmath97 of table iiia @xcite gives @xmath109 = 0.038 fm .",
    "for the 147 isotopes with @xmath121 of the table @xmath109 = 0.040 fm .",
    "the next formula estimates the radii for @xmath103 6 by adding the volumes of the charge of the peripheral @xmath60 @xmath122-clusters and the body of the core , consisting of the volume occupied by the bodies of the alpha - clusters and the volume of the excess nn - pairs @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124=0.954 fm stands for the radius of the volume which is one nucleon s share in the volume of an @xmath28-cluster body , @xmath125 = 0.796 fm is the radius of one neutron of a nn - pair . the deviation @xmath109 = 0.028 fm from fitting the data of the isotopes with @xmath97 of table iiia @xcite . for the experimental radii of the 147 isotopes with @xmath121 of the table @xmath109 = 0.037",
    "one should notice here that the radius of a core @xmath28 - cluster @xmath126 is not its mass radius .",
    "it rather defines the space which ca nt be occupied by excess neutrons , because there is some structure made of pn - pairs .",
    "the results of fitting experimental radii show that the charge radius of an @xmath127-cluster slowly changes with growing @xmath4 ( otherwise @xmath101 would not depend of the group of data selected for fitting ) .",
    "so does the @xmath0- cluster s body radius .",
    "the real mass radii of all nucleons considered as elementary bricks of a nucleus should be equal and they can not change , because the binding energies are too small in comparison with their masses .",
    "the well known formula @xmath128 of the liquid drop model with the fitted value @xmath129 = 0.95 fm for the isotopes with @xmath97 of the table iiia @xcite gives the considerably bigger deviation @xmath109 = 0.067 fm and for 147 isotopes with @xmath121 rms deviation is @xmath109 = 0.12 fm , which is considerably worse than those of the equations ( 9 - 12 ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the distances between nucleons in a nucleus are not related to their mass radii .",
    "the experimental data of the other isotopes with @xmath130 77 are presented in @xcite in a separate table , table iiic , because they are treated as deformed ones .",
    "the radii for the isotopes calculated by ( 9 - 12 ) with the @xmath131 obtained in the analysis of experimental binding energies ( see section 2 ) are in an agreement with the data in the table , although they are always less than the experimental radii on several hundredths of fm .",
    "for the nuclei with @xmath132 the number @xmath133 is found from the analysis of experimental binding energies @xcite with average deviation of calculated energies from experimental values in 2.5 mev .",
    "some examples are given in the table in appendix .",
    "all isotopes with growing the number @xmath134 have the @xmath107 increasing and @xmath133 correspondingly decreasing . at @xmath1-stable isotopes",
    "@xmath133 reaches the value 2 for some of the isotopes with @xmath135 and @xmath136 = 4 for some of the isotopes with @xmath137 . for the other @xmath1-stable isotopes @xmath60= 3 .",
    "the @xmath37-stable isotopes with @xmath138 have @xmath139 .",
    "the calculated binding energies of the isotopes with 12 @xmath140 29 do not depend much on @xmath141 varied within 2 @xmath142 5 .",
    "so for the @xmath143-stable isotopes of the nuclei with 24 @xmath140 29 it is suggested that @xmath60 equals 3 as it does for the heavier nuclei . for the light nuclei having core @xmath144",
    "the calculations on ( 10 - 12 ) with the value @xmath49 = 5 give a small deviation @xmath101 from the experimental radii . spreading the common rule that with growing @xmath5 the value @xmath49 decreases to 3 for these nuclei makes the deviations smaller .",
    "the specific density of core binding energy is calculated as @xmath145 where @xmath66 is ( 4 ) for the isotopes with @xmath103 30 , @xmath146 at the charge radius of the core @xmath0 - cluster @xmath147 fm taken from fitting the experimental radii by ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the value @xmath6 grows slowly with the number of excess neutrons and at @xmath148-stable isotopes it reaches a saturation value @xmath149 @xmath150 . for example , the @xmath37-stable isotopes with @xmath4 = 30 , 60 and 80 have @xmath136= 3 and @xmath151 @xmath152 , @xmath153 @xmath154 and 2.47 @xmath85 2.55 @xmath154 correspondingly . then the narrow strip of binding energies of @xmath1 - stability is to be outlined by @xmath17 ( 2 ) with @xmath155 . with @xmath60 =3 ( for @xmath156 84 ) and @xmath157 @xmath158",
    "the binding energy @xmath17 ( 2 ) is a function of one variable @xmath159 ( @xmath4 ) @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( for the @xmath163 22 the empirical values @xmath116 are used , see ( 17 ) in @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "1 the graph of the function ( 13 ) is given in comparison with the experimental values of the lightest and the heaviest even @xmath4 beta - stable isotopes depicting the boundaries of @xmath37-stability .",
    "the width of the strip is determined by the variation of @xmath6 within 2.5 @xmath85 2.7 @xmath154 and by the number @xmath46 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath164=43.34 mev is the core binding energy per one @xmath0 - cluster",
    ". then the number of excess neutrons of @xmath1 - stability is defined by ( 5 ) and by the eq .",
    "@xmath165 .",
    "= 3 and 5.,width=377 ]    as it was shown in @xcite the binding energies of the excess nn - pairs in @xmath166-stable nuclei obey the eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the accuracy in a few mev .",
    "therefore the energy @xmath17 ( 2,8 ) with @xmath167 ( 5 ) can be calculated only for those isotopes that have the excess neutrons inside the core , i.e. for the @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the mass number of the heaviest @xmath37-stable isotope among those belonging to one @xmath4 .",
    "examples are given in table 1 ( see appendix ) for the isotopes with @xmath4 = 30 , 31 , 80 , 81 .",
    "for @xmath4 = 30 and 31 all the isotopes with @xmath44 with known energies are given .",
    "one can see that for the isotopes with @xmath170 the values of the nn - pair separation energy @xmath171 less than @xmath172 ( 5 ) .",
    "it allows one to suggest that the nn - pairs come out of the core not affecting the core density . in such cases the binding energy is equal to the sum of e ( 2 ) for the isotope @xmath169 and @xmath173 of the last nn - pairs .",
    "one can see that @xmath174 for both isotopes @xmath55 and @xmath56 in most of the cases are almost equal .",
    "it approves the idea that the cores of the nuclei with @xmath4 and @xmath175 are mostly equal .",
    "one can see from table 1 , that the separation energies @xmath174 for the most of the pairs of @xmath55 and @xmath56 differ within 1 mev .",
    "it allows one to make a prediction for some isotopes with @xmath176 , when the energy of the complementary nucleus has been already measured .",
    "some of the predicted values are @xmath177 = 1007 mev , @xmath178 = 1034 mev , @xmath179= 1132 mev , @xmath180 = 1171 mev , @xmath181 = 1193 mev , @xmath182=1500 mev , @xmath183=1529 mev , @xmath184=1348 mev , @xmath185=1929 mev .    in accordance with the representation of a core as a liquid drop",
    "one can suggest that the excess nn - pairs concentrate inside the core near its surface due to the surface tension , so that the filling out the space inside the core goes from surface to center .",
    "the very first nn - pairs can be at the boundary of the core defined by core s charge radius .",
    "therefore for the isotopes lighter than stable ones the equations ( 9 - 11 ) should predict the charge radii . for the @xmath1 - stable isotopes and the heavier ones with the nn - pairs out of the core one should use ( 12 ) to estimate the nuclear size .",
    "then the nuclear radii with growing @xmath5 should first decrease with decreasing @xmath60 till the stable isotopes , which have approximately equal radii calculated by ( 9 - 12 ) . for the heavier isotopes",
    "the radii slowly increase ( 12 ) with growing @xmath5 because of the growing amount of nn - pairs on the surface of the core .",
