    "the exchange energy is a fundamental quantity of many - body physics .",
    "while it can be calculated analytically and exactly for simple quantum fluids , such as the three - dimensional interacting electron gas in the absence of magnetic fields , its evaluation for realistic , spatially inhomogeneous , many - electron systems is possible only numerically , _",
    "e.g. _ by means of density - functional theory ( dft ) within the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda).@xcite in collinear spin - dft ( sdft ) , the exact exchange energy is a functional of the spin - resolved charge density @xmath1 $ ] . in strong external or internal magnetic fields",
    ", orbital magnetism must be accounted for on the same footing as spin magnetism , and sdft is replaced by current - dft ( cdft)@xcite or magnetic - field dft ( bdft).@xcite    in the present paper we discuss exact and approximate expressions for the spin - dependence of the exchange energy @xmath2 .",
    "we show that , for arbitrary collinear - spin many - body systems , the dependence of @xmath2 on spin - resolved charge and current densities can be fully reconstructed from either of two extreme limits : a fully polarized system or a completely unpolarized system .",
    "reconstruction from the limit of an unpolarized system yields a generalization of the oliver - perdew spin scaling relations@xcite from sdft to cdft .",
    "the alternative possibility of reconstruction from the limit of a fully polarized system results in explict expressions for the high - field exchange energy , which can be used as input for the lsda of cdft or of bdft .",
    "since exchange acts only between like - spin electrons , the exchange energy of an arbitrary many - electron system ( homogeneous or not , in a magnetic field or not ) can be written as the sum of two contributions , one arising entirely from the spin up subsystem , the other from the spin down subsystem @xmath3 this decomposition is valid as long as there is a preferred direction relative to which one can define spin up and spin down , _",
    "i.e. _ for collinear magnetism .",
    "it only ceases to be valid in noncollinear situations , where the quantization axis changes as a function of space .",
    "the exchange energy then acquires a spin off - diagonal contribution which , in principle , can be treated on the same footing as the diagonal term.@xcite here , we are only concerned with collinear situations , occuring in unidirectional magnetic fields . under these circumstances , eq .",

    "the decomposition ( [ exdecomp ] ) then implies @xmath10= \\tilde{e_x}[n_{\\uparrow},{\\bf j}_{\\uparrow } ] + \\tilde{e}_x[n_{\\downarrow},{\\bf j}_{\\downarrow } ] , \\label{exfunc}\\ ] ] where the spin up and spin down contribution are given by the same functional , although their values for specific densities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are , generally , different .",

    "we find @xmath16 = e_x^{fp}[n,{\\bf j } ] $ ] , which implies that the general exchange energy can also be written as @xmath10= e_x^{fp}[n_{\\uparrow},{\\bf j}_{\\uparrow } ] + e_x^{fp}[n_{\\downarrow},{\\bf j}_{\\downarrow } ] .",

    "( [ exfuncnp ] ) reduces to the spin - scaling relations of oliver and perdew,@xcite which are frequently used in spin - density - functional theory ( sdft ) to connect spin - density functionals for arbitrarily polarized systems to density functionals obtained from many - body calculations for an unpolarized system.@xcite equation  ( [ exfuncnp ] ) is the generalization of this spin scaling from sdft to cdft , and may be employed in the same way .",
    "equations reconstructing the general functional from the fully polarized limit , such as eq .",
    "( [ exfuncfp ] ) , are less used in dft , where one usually constructs a spin - dependent functional by starting from the unpolarized situation .",
    "however , they are useful in the special case of the high - field limit , where analytical results for the fully polarized exchange energy of the homogeneous interacting electron gas are available for the first ( @xmath17)@xcite and second ( @xmath18)@xcite landau level .",
    "in the homogeneous electron gas in a constant unidirectional magnetic field @xmath19 , the charge density and the physical current density are spatially constant",
    ". for sufficiently high magnetic fields only the lowest landau level contributes , and the electrons are fully spin polarized .",
    "the per - volume exchange energy @xmath20 in this situation has been evaluated analytically by danz and glasser.@xcite in the limit in which all electrons occupy the bottom of the lowest landau level , @xmath17 , they find , @xmath21 ,   \\label{dgfp}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the magnetic length .    expressions applicable to still higher fields , as well as generalization to weaker fields in which the restriction to the bottom of the lowest landau level is removed ( while maintaining that to the lowest landau level , @xmath17 , itself ) can be found in the original reference.@xcite in a recent paper@xcite we reevaluated the exchange energy in these limits , corrected a few minor problems in the original equations,@xcite and discussed the range of magnetic fields and densities where each of them applies .    for still weaker magnetic fields , two complications can take place : orbital magnetism now aquires a contribution of higher landau levels , and spin magnetism is reduced , as the system is not necessarily fully polarized .",
    "we dealt with the former complication by deriving an explicit expression for @xmath18.@xcite here , we consider partial and vanishing spin polarization , which may occur for lower fields , in particular when the electron @xmath23 factor is smaller than @xmath24 .    in a first step ,",
    "we note that the many - body calculations@xcite yield @xmath25 as function of the charge density @xmath26 and the magnetic field @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ the variables used in bdft , but not of the spin and current densities used in cdft . the transition from one set of variables to the other",
