    "<S> _ introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ the coupled - resonator induced transparency ( crit ) , arising when light passes through two closely located identical ring optical resonators , was first put forward in @xcite and then experimentally observed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transparency comes from the interference between two pathways of the light , leading to the fano effect in the coupled ring resonator system . </S>",
    "<S> the crit effect has a wide variety of applications in linear regime , such as slowing and stopping light @xcite , signal routing mancinelli:11 , and biomedical molecule sensing @xcite . in the highly nonlinear regime , </S>",
    "<S> the system shows bistability lu2008proposal , which can be used for optical switching @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we consider such a situation : one of the ring resonators in crit is replaced by an optomechanical system ( toroidal ) , in which the optical mode and mechanical vibration mode are coupled through radiation pressure coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this simple structure forms a hybrid crit and optomechanical system . </S>",
    "<S> as we show the interplay between crit and optomechanics can lead to more interesting effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular by including the optomechanical nonlinearity the transparency window of the crit becomes tunable and also exhibits bistability . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the coupled system undergoes saddle node and hopf bifurcations which result in the emergence of bistabilities , isolated branches ( isolas ) @xcite and self - sustained oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> detection of weak forces with high sensitivity has long been a research focus . </S>",

    "<S> the general idea for realizing those proposals is to map a weak force onto the shift in position of a mechanical system that can be easily monitored by the coupled optical field . </S>",

    "<S> the mechanical mode is affected by a viscous force with the damping rate @xmath25 and by a brownian stochastic force with noise @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the system is strongly driven , it can be characterized by the semiclassical steady - state solutions with large amplitudes for both mechanical and optical modes . in the following , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ crit ] ) shows us how the presence of the mechanical motion modifies the behaviors of crit .    in figures [ figure3](a)-(d ) , the transmission @xmath63 is plotted versus the detuning @xmath62 with different input light intensities . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , for a small driving intensity , there is a symmetric narrow transparency window in the middle of transmission spectrum ( figure [ figure3](a ) ) , which is very similar to the typical crit effect except for a slight shift of the center of the transparency window . </S>",
    "<S> the result can be explained as follows , for a tiny input intensity , the value of the mechanical resonator position can be approximately rewritten as @xmath64which is independent of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the mechanical motion merely shifts the center without changing the shape of the transparency window . with @xmath21 increasing , </S>",
    "<S> the transparency window bends towards the right side and the transmission curve becomes bistable ( figure 3(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that , for certain @xmath21 , the distorted transparency window breaks into a mother branch and an isola ( figure [ figure3](c ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> for large enough input light intensity , the nonlinear shift causes an instability in intracavity photon number and system variables . </S>",
