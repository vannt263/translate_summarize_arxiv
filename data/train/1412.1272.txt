    "plants , diverse species of algae , and other organisms acquire chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates ( sugars ) from the sun through photosynthesis . these photoassimilates are exported from plant leaves via the phloem vascular system to support life in distal parts of the organism .",
    "the flow is driven by a build - up of osmotic pressure in the veins , where high concentrations of sugar direct a bulk flow of sweet sap out of the leaf .",
    "the vascular network is critical to sustenance and growth ; more subtly , it is also of importance as carrier of signaling molecules that integrate disparate sources of information across the organism .",
    "the mechanisms that influence phloem structure to fulfill these multiple objectives , however , remain poorly understood .",
    "the phloem is a complex distribution system responsible for transporting a large number of organic molecules , defensive compounds , and developmental signals by bulk fluid flow through a network of enlongated sieve element cells which are connected to each other by porous sieve plates , effectively forming long tubes @xcite .",
    "the phloem thus serves functions analogous to a combination of the nervous- and circulatory systems of animals .",
    "the role of the phloem in the transport of photoassimlates has been known since the 17th century @xcite , but it was not until 1930 that the role of the phloem sieve element as the channel of carbohydrate transport in plants was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "although the primary role of phloem transport is to distribute the products of photosynthesis , it also plays a role in long - distance transmission of signals for some developmental and environmental responses .",
    "for instance , flowering is induced by transmission of a phloem - mobile hormone from the leaves to the meristem @xcite .",
    "also , pathogen protection and related gene expression signals have been shown to occur through the phloem @xcite .",
    "phloem flow occurs in an interconnected network of long , narrow cylindrical cells . in these cells , an energy - rich solution of sap containing @xmath0 wt sugars flows toward distal regions of the plant @xcite .",
    "transport is driven by the osmotic mnch pump @xcite .",
    "the flow is initiated in the leaf , where sugars produced by photosynthesis accumulate in phloem cells .",
    "this induces an osmotic gradient with respect to the surrounding tissue , drawing in water into the phloem cells . on the scale of the phloem tissue , this process results in a bulk flow of sap along the major veins out of the leaf , towards regions of low osmotic potential in the plant , such as roots or fruits .",
    "mnch flow in a conifer needle is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : abies - cross - section ] , where the phloem tissue is located within a single large vein near the center of the leaf cross - section plane .",
    "close to the tip of the needle only few sieve tubes exist to support the flow of sap , more continually being added to the bundle as one moves closer to the petiole .",
    "neighboring sieve tubes maintain hydraulic connections through plasmodesmata .",
    "the driving force responsible for carbon export is the steady production of photosynthate in the leaf mesophyll located close to the leaf surface .",
    "the mechanism by which sugars accumulate in the phloem varies between species .",
    "most plants , however , can be roughly divided into two groups : active and passive phloem loaders @xcite .",
    "active loaders use membrane transporters or sugar polymerization to accrue carbon in the phloem , while passive loaders rely on cell - to - cell diffusion aided by bulk flow through plasmodesmata pores @xcite .",
    "trees are predominantly passive loaders , while many herbaceous plants use active phloem loading @xcite .    the quantity of material exported through the phloem is generally assumed to be strongly dependent on physiological factors such as solar radiation intensity and water availability @xcite , but it also likely to depend on details of the leaf vascular architecture .",
    "for instance , the positioning and network structure of water - transporting xylem conduits in plant stems and leaves has been shown to play an important role in determining the efficiency of co@xmath1 uptake @xcite . while the branched vein network architecture in plant leaves has been studied extensively , less is known about the functional elements . except for a few species of grasses , which have a parallel vein geometry similar to needles @xcite ,",
    "the detailed functional architecture of the phloem ( i.e. the location , number , and size of conducting elements ) in plant leaves remains unknown , in part due to the high sensitivity of phloem tissue to disturbances @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to answer two basic questions .",
    "first , we ask what is the design of the phloem vascular system in conifer needles , i.e. what are its geometric and hydrodynamic properties .",
    "second , we aim to determine whether the observed structure is consistent with energy minimization or maximizing flow rate to elucidate the selective force that influences phloem structure .",
    "we chose conifer needles for this study in part due to their linear structure without branching veins , a geometric feature which greatly simplifies the analysis of the transport process .",
    "moreover , conifer trees inhabit diverse environments and the vascular network has thus been subjected to a broad selective pressure . accordingly , we present the experimental results of phloem geometry in needles of four conifer species from a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes . based on these , we develop a minimal mathematical model of sugar transport in leaves , and use a constrained optimization to derive the optimal phloem geometry in a one - dimensional leaf .",
    "finally , we compare modeling with experimental results , and conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the study of conifers and plants in general .",
    "we measured the phloem geometry in needles of four conifer species shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : needles ] : _ abies nordmanniana _ , _ pinus palustris _ , _ pinus cembra _ , and _",
    "picea omorika_. three to six needles were sampled from each species .",
    "the species encompass the range of typical needle sizes of conifer species , from _ p. omorika _",
    "( needle length @xmath2 ) to _ p. palustris _ ( @xmath3 ) . additionally , they incorporated plants from diverse habitats and climates ranging from _ p. palustris _ ,",
    "whose habitat are the gulf and atlantic coastal plains of the united states , to the european alpine _",
    "p. cembra_. the measurements were conducted by performing transverse sections at 10 - 20 positions along the length of the needle .",
    "phloem cells were identified by the presence of a stain as described in the materials and methods section . a typical stack of images obtained this way is shown in fig .  [ fig : abies - cross - section ] ( c ) .",
    "to quantify the phloem structure we measured the size of all sieve elements in each cross section .",
    "starting from the tip of the needle , we typically observed an increase in the total conductive area @xmath4 towards the base of the leaf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : master - a - linlin ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the cross - sectional area of individual sieve elements @xmath5 ( fig .  [ fig : master - a - linlin ] ( b ) ) , however , shows only minimal variation as a function of length ( correlation to position using _ pearson s _",
    "@xmath6 for all needles in fig .",
    "[ fig : master - a - linlin ] ( b ) ) , implying that the main variation in transport area is driven by changes in the number of conduits @xmath7 . when the total phloem transport area is normalized and plotted relative to the needle length @xmath8 on logarithmic axes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : master - a - loglog ] ) , it is seen to behave roughly as a power law @xmath9 with average exponents per species between @xmath10 ( _ p .",
    "omorika _ ) and @xmath11 ( _ a .",
    "nordmanniana _ ) , see table 1 .",
    "the number of sieve elements @xmath12 follows a similar scaling with @xmath13 .",
    "since the cross - sectional area of individual sieve elements is nearly constant , this result is to be expected .      to rationalize the observed vein structure ,",
    "we develop a simple model of one - dimensional sugar transport in a bundle of parallel phloem tubes based on the work of horwitz @xcite and thompson and holbrook @xcite .",
    "sugar flow commences near the needle tip ( @xmath14 ) , where a few phloem conduits initiate the export of photoassimilates . approaching the needle base ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the number of conducting channels @xmath7 increases while the size of individual phloem tubes remains constant . because the length scale at which @xmath7 varies is small compared to the total length @xmath8 of the needle , we can approximate @xmath7 well by a smooth function .",
    "we note that the precise way in which the number of sieve tubes changes ( be it by simple addition of new tubes or branching of existing ones ) has no impact on the continuum description .",
    "phloem loading in conifers is thought to be passive , driven by cell - to - cell diffusion across microscopic ( plasmodesmata ) channels @xcite .",
    "the sugar loading rate per unit length of needle @xmath16 is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis and to the circumference of the needle , both of which are approximately constant along the needle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : needles ] ) . for a collection of parallel phloem tubes , conservation of sugar mass can be expressed as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is sugar current with @xmath19 the total volume flow rate and @xmath20 the sap sugar concentration .",
    "we further assume that at each point water enters the sieve elements by osmosis    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the total conductive phloem area at the position @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abies - cross - section ] for visualization ) .",
    "note that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of sieve tubes at position @xmath23 and @xmath26 is the cross sectional area of a single sieve tube . in eq .",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the permeability of the sieve element membrane , @xmath28 is the universal gas constant , @xmath29 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath30 is the radius of one single sieve element .",
    "the sugar concentration @xmath31 available for driving an osmotic flow is the difference between the concentration in the sieve element @xmath32 and the constant osmotic concentration @xmath33 of the surrounding cells .",
    "likewise , the pressure @xmath34 is the difference between the cytoplasmic pressure @xmath35 and the constant pressure in neighboring cells @xmath36 .",
    "for clarity we use the vant hoff value @xmath37 for the osmotic pressure in eq .  , which is valid only for dilute ( ideal ) solutions .",
    "at the concentrations relevant to phloem sap ( @xmath38 m ) , the error in the osmotic pressure introduced by using the vant hoff value is @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "equation may be integrated to yield @xmath40 , having imposed a vanishing current at the tip .",
    "the total export of sugar from the needle is therefore @xmath41 , proportional to the loading rate @xmath16 and needle length @xmath8 .",
    "the factors contributing to the energetic cost of transport include the metabolic energy required to maintain the vasculature and the power dissipated by the flow due to viscous friction .",
    "we proceed to consider how the phloem structure influences the magnitude of these contributions , and note that similar energy considerations have been used in the study of other biological transport systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , zwieniecki and co - workers derived the optimal distribution of tracheids in a pine needle that minimizes the pressure drop required to drive transpiration for a given investment in xylem conduit volume @xcite .",
    "the phloem consists of severely reduced cells which shed most of their organelles during maturation .",
    "it is , however , alive and relies on external supply of metabolic energy .",
    "the rate of energy consumption by the phloem tissue itself may be seen as an energetic maintenance cost of the transport conduit . here , we assume that this energetic cost of maintaining the phloem vasculature is proportional to the conductive volume @xmath42 , or equivalently the number of phloem cells ( assuming cells of roughly equal size ) .",
    "the viscous power dissipation per unit length is @xmath43 . to determine @xmath44",
    ", we note that the local pressure gradient is related to the flow speed @xmath45 by darcy s law    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the pressure , @xmath48 is the viscosity of phloem sap ( typically around 5 times that of water @xcite ) and @xmath49 is a geometric constant which solely depends on the cross sectional area @xmath26 of single sieve elements . integrating eq .",
    "leads to @xmath50 , and thus the local pressure gradient is given by    @xmath51    analysis of the coupled system in eqns .   and",
    "have shown that the concentration @xmath20 is approximately constant along the needle @xmath52 @xcite ( see also the supplementary information ) . integrating the differential relation for @xmath44 using the above set of approximations ,",
    "the total power dissipation is    @xmath53    for a given conductive phloem volume @xmath54 , we can now determine the area distribution @xmath22 which minimizes the viscous power dissipation .",
    "using the method of lagrange multipliers and the calculus of variations , one finds that the distribution which minimizes under the constraint @xmath55 is    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the average total area of sieve elements . assuming a bundle of sieve elements with constant cross sectional area , this result may be translated immediately to total number of sieve elements by    @xmath58    where @xmath26 is the cross sectional area of a single sieve element . from eqns .   and",
    ", we conclude that a scaling of phloem sieve element number or area with the power @xmath59 minimizes the viscous power dissipation .",
    "the observed scaling exponents ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : master - a - loglog ] and table 1 ) are close to these values , suggesting that the sieve element areas roughly follow the theoretical optimum .",
    "we note that the square - root scaling in eq .",
    "@xcite for the tapering of pine needle xylem conduits .",
    "the coupling between water flow and phloem loading required to maintain a constant photosynthetic rate along the needle is thus responsible for driving this remarkable convergence in vascular architecture . in the context of leaf development , we note that pine needles grow from a meristem located at the base of the needle which gradually propels the tip away from the growth zone . newly formed tissue at the base of the needle gradually becomes mature and loses its ability to change its structure as the needle extends .",
    "the distribution of phloem conduits along the needle length thus appears to be either predetermined or rely on exchange of information between the tip of the needle and the meristem .    while our model is not generally applicable to complex reticulate or anastomosing vein networks , we expect it to be suitable for analysis of leaves with parallel veins , given that the assumption of constant sieve element properties is valid .",
    "evidence to support this hypothesis is found in studies by r. f. evert and co ",
    "workers @xcite , who observed similar trends in grasses .",
    "for example , phloem area in barley , maize , and sugarcane roughly follow the @xmath59 law , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : master - a - loglog ] inset ) , suggesting that the energy dissipation criterion leading to the prediction @xmath60 is broadly applicable .",
    "we show in the appendix that the constant volume constraint imposed when obtaining @xmath60 can be relaxed , and that sub - linear scalings is a general feature of the energy minimization principle .",
    "previous works @xcite , which focused on one - dimensional models of flow in sieve elements , identified the transport velocity ( phloem sap flux density ) as an important physiological parameter .",
    "in fact , optimizing the sieve element radius ( @xmath30 in eqn . [",
    "eqn : net - currents ] ) for maximum flux at the whole plant level results in predictions that are in agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find ( see supplementary information ) that while the observed conduit distribution ( i.e. @xmath61 ) minimizes the energetic cost of transport for a fixed tube radius @xmath30 , it does not maximize the average flux density .",
    "the size of individual phloem cells at the level of the whole tree thus appears to be optimized for flux density , while the arrangement of tubes in the needle minimizes the energetic cost of transport , working in concert to produce an efficient system of nutrient translocation .",
    "in this work , we studied the physical properties of nutrient transport in the phloem of conifer needles .",
    "we measured the geometrical properties of needle phloem in several conifer species , varying over one order of magnitude in length , and found that their cross sectional area distribution roughly follows the law @xmath62 .",
    "we presented a simple mathematical model which is able to rationalize the observed needle tube geometry by means of minimization of the energy dissipated during flow .",
    "expenditure of energy is unavoidable since although the transport is entirely passive by virtue of the osmotic flow process , the plant is forced to maintain an osmotic gradient , consuming energy in the process .",
    "we found that experimental data from several species of conifers agree well with the theoretically derived law of area distribution .",
    "simple models such as the ones considered in this work may not only elucidate the properties of structures with modest complexity we see in the living world , but also serve as an important stepping stone to further understanding of more complicated systems .",
    "the basic underlying constraints and functional requirements that dictate needle design in conifers are not unique to this group of plants .",
    "data from parallel - veined grasses indicate similar trends , and the design requirements are expected to hold for plants with reticulate venation patterns .",
    "the same mathematical model can potentially be extended to predict vascular distribution when the leaf lamina is broad and the single vein is replaced by an extensive reticulate network .",
    "the conifer needle belongs to a general class of network systems that follow a principle of energy dissipation minimization .",
    "other important members of this class which is not constrained to one - dimensional or even planar systems include the networks of blood vessels in animals @xcite , the xylem vascular system in plants @xcite and even river basin networks in geomorphology @xcite , thus establishing the importance of optimization considerations .    finally , we point out that in recent years the constructal law , stipulating that all living organisms are built so as to optimally facilitate flow ( of fluids , stresses , energy ) has enjoyed some success @xcite in explaining the structure and apparent design of biological systems .",
    "the findings we report in this paper appear to be in accordance with the basic ideas from constructal theory .",

    "sections were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( sp5x , leica microsystems ) . in this way , 3 to 6 needles of average length ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : abies - cross - section ] and [ fig : needles ] ) from each species were analyzed .",
    "the number of sieve elements and their cross - sectional area were quantified using the image analysis software volocity ( version 5.3 , perkinelmer ) .    by way of fluorescence staining with the live - cell marker carboxy fluorescein diacetate ( sigma - aldrich ) non - functional sieve elements",

    "we consider a extension of the constant volume constraint by introducing a more general dependency on some power of the total area ,    @xmath65    where we now think of @xmath66 as a general cost of building material and metabolism which scales with cross - sectional area in a nonlinear way .",
