    ". those resonances may correlate to states in the discrete spectrum of the target .",
    "to interpret such scattering data requires use of a complex coupled - channel reaction theory .",
    "a theory with very important improvements over those used heretofore has been developed  @xcite .",
    "this theory , named a multi - channel algebraic scattering ( mcas ) theory , finds solution of the coupled lippmann - schwinger equations for the quantum scattering of two fragments .",
    "though the method can be applied to quite general scattering systems , to date studies have been limited to nucleon scattering from zero ground state spin targets .    the prime information sought are scattering ( @xmath0- ) matrices which are easily extracted from the @xmath1-matrices generated by mcas .",
    "the approach involves using matrix algebra on matrices built using sturmian - state expansions of the relevant nucleon - nucleus potential matrix . with this method",
    ", all resonances in any energy range can be identified , and their centroids , widths , and spin - parities determined as can the energies and spin - parities of sub - threshold states of the system .",
    "it has long been known that collective - model prescriptions of nucleon - nucleus scattering violate the pauli principle .",
    "however , the mcas procedure enables use of an orthogonalizing pseudo - potential ( opp ) approximation by which unphysical effects due to violation of the pauli principle can be avoided .",
    "doing so is crucial to finding the parameter values of the interaction that simultaneously gives the sub - threshold spectrum and the low energy scattering cross sections  @xcite .    the multichannel formalism and the process by which resonances can be identified and located are outlined next .",
    "results of calculations made using a collective - model prescription for the potential matrix are then discussed . in that collective model , the interaction field",
    "is allowed to be deformed from sphericity and that deformation is taken to second order . in studies of nucleon scattering from @xmath2c ,",
    "coupling is taken to the ground @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( 4.4389 mev ) , and @xmath5 ( 7.6542 mev ) states and we consider nucleon energies to 6 mev . with these three states defining the relevant target spectrum , only quadrupole deformation is involved . in a new development , we have applied the mcas method to the @xmath6+@xmath7he system and have compared results with the spectrum of @xmath8li known from experiment .",
    "the theory also allows the construction of the optical potential by appropriately subsuming the coupled - channel equations into effective elastic - channel scattering equations .",
    "the optical potentials thus constructed , as well as allowing for the pauli principle , are very nonlocal and energy dependent . however , the potentials guarantee that their use lead to cross section details including resonance effects .",

    "we seek to see if , when one performs as exactly the same evaluation as possible , the calculations are equivalent .",
    "also , for a typical low energy problem , we ask how the pauli principle influences the results .    to make a `` fair '' comparison , we have used a simplified model for the @xmath9+@xmath10c system .",
    "we chose the same three target states to define the coupled channels in both the coordinate - space ( ecis97  @xcite ) and momentum - space ( mcas ) evaluations .",

    "was obtained by limiting deformation to first order and now the agreement with the ecis result is much better for both background and the resonances ; centroids and widths .",
    "we draw two conclusions .",
    "first when the simplified model is used in exactly the same way in finding solutions of the coupled - channel problem using the coordinate - space approach  @xcite and the momentum - space approach with mcas  @xcite , the scattering cross sections agree very well .",
    "the smooth background as well as the specific resonances that can be generated with ecis are found with the mcas run . those were calculations with deformation taken to first order .",
    "the second conclusion from comparison of the two mcas results is that , with deformation of -0.52 in the @xmath9+@xmath10c system , expansion of @xmath50 need be taken to second order .",
    "however , all of the calculations ignored the effects of the pauli principle  @xcite .",
    "but in the mcas approach , the opp method can be used to ensure that there is no violation of the pauli principle even when a collective model is used to specify the interaction potentials .",
    "the opp method constrains the sturmians used as an expansion set are orthogonal to all states in which the incoming nucleon would be trapped into an orbit fully occupied by nucleons in the target .",
    "using such a conditioned sturmian function set to solve the mcas theory of coupled equations gave the cross section displayed by the solid curve in fig .",

    "the procedure is to solve the matrix equations for the eigenvalues @xmath55 for a ( finite ) set of energies .",

    "those eigenvalues are complex and their imaginary part relates to the resonance width  @xcite .",

    "that is very evident with curve ( 1 ) , but similar though more slight features are evident in the trajectories ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
