    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , cp violation is due to a complex parameter in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "extensions of the sm typically include new sources of cp violation . to understand the origin of cp violation it is important to investigate as many systems as possible .",
    "one area that deserves further investigation is the @xmath8 system .",
    "we consider a few hadronic decay modes of the @xmath8 . in the sm",
    ", there is virtually no cp violation in these decay modes .",
    "thus , any observation of cp violation for these decays would be a clear indication of new physics ( np ) .",
    "cp - odd observables require at least two contributing amplitudes in order to be non - zero .",
    "in addition to the usual w - exchange amplitude that is present in the sm , we assume that there is also a contribution that arises due to the exchange of a charged higgs boson ",
    "see fig .",

    "decays showing the @xmath9 and @xmath10 contributions.,width=151 ]    many extensions of the sm include extra higgs bosons .",
    "the charged higgs couplings to light quarks in these models are often proportional to the quark masses , and are thus very small .",
    "we investigate @xmath8 decays that contain light quarks in the final state  @xcite .. copyright ( 2007 ) by the american physical society .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details . ]",
    "if cp violation is to be large in these decays , the charged higgs couplings must be large .",
    "thus , these decays probe `` non - standard '' np cp violation .",
    "suppose two amplitudes contribute to a particular process",
    ". then the total amplitude may be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the relative weak ( cp - odd ) and strong ( cp - even ) phases , respectively .",
    "the full rate for the process is obtained by calculating @xmath14 , summing / averaging over spins , and integrating over phase space .",
    "the regular rate asymmetry for a particular decay mode is proportional to the difference between the rate for the process and that for its associated anti - process .",
    "the result is proportional to @xmath15 and thus requires both a weak phase difference ( @xmath12 ) and a strong phase difference ( @xmath13 ) between the contributing amplitudes .",
    "the rate asymmetry can be altered in various ways .",
    "for example , if some of the spins are measured , one does not sum over them .",
    "one can also integrate asymmetrically over phase space ( or use a more general weighting function ) to isolate certain terms in the differential width . in some cases this leads to asymmetries that are proportional to @xmath16 , similar to the regular rate asymmetry .",
    "one particular class of asymmetries involves triple products , which have the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are momenta and/or spins .",
    "cp asymmetries constructed from triple products have the form @xmath21 and thus require a weak phase difference , but not a strong phase difference .",
    "consider the decay @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents a vector or axial vector meson . the general structure for the sm hadronic current for this decay",
    "is given by  @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and where @xmath27 denotes the polarization tensor of the @xmath24 .",
    "experimentally , the form factor @xmath28 dominates for @xmath29 and @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 are expected to dominate for @xmath32 .",
    "the scalar form factor , @xmath33 , is expected to be very small within the sm .",
    "the np charged higgs effect may be parameterized in terms of new scalar and pseudo - scalar quark - level operators .",
    "the resulting current is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a form factor for the quark - level operators and @xmath36 and @xmath37 arise from the coupling of the charged higgs boson to the quarks and leptons .",
    "the charged higgs effect can be incorporated into the expression for the hadronic current [ eq .  ( [ eq : wamp ] ) ] by the replacement @xmath38 , where @xmath39 the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be complex ; that is , they can contain a ( cp - odd ) weak phase .",
    "the various form factors are potential sources of strong phases .",
    "the regular rate asymmetry is proportional to @xmath40 for the @xmath29 case ( integrated over phase space ) , where the @xmath13 s are the strong phases associated with the form factors and @xmath41 is the ( cp - odd ) phase of the complex higgs coupling @xmath37 .",
    "an analogous expression ( with @xmath37 replaced by @xmath36 ) holds for the case @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath33 is expected to be very small , we conclude that the rate asymmetry is unlikely to be measureable , even in the presence of np .      weighting the differential width by @xmath42 while performing the integration over phase space ( @xmath43 is a particular kinematical angle ",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ) extracts terms containing the combinations @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "such terms could be non - vanishing for the decay @xmath2 ( since @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 are expected to be the dominant sm form factors in this case ) . constructing a cp asymmetry from this quantity yields an expression that depends on the polarization of the @xmath8 and that contains pieces such as @xmath46 .",
    "this asymmetry requires a strong phase difference between @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) and @xmath35 .",
    "numerical estimates ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) indicate that asymmetries of order 15% ( 7.5% ) could be possible , given the uncertainties in the experimental measurement of the branching ratio .",
    "the first estimate assumes that only @xmath31 contributes to the sm amplitude ; the second that only @xmath30 does .      a triple product ( tp ) can be constructed using the polarization tensor of the vector meson .",
    "the tp contains the combination of form factors @xmath47 , and could thus be non - zero for the decay @xmath5 ( for which @xmath28 dominates the sm hadronic current ) . constructing a cp asymmetry from the tp yields an expression that contains @xmath48 ; thus this cp asymmetry does not require the presence of a relative strong phase between the sm and np amplitudes . a numerical estimate performed in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the tp asymmetry could be as large as 30% multiplied by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are particular direction vectors in the hadronic rest frame and @xmath52 is the polarization vector of the @xmath53 .",
    "the previous approach can be generalized to the decay @xmath55 .",
    "the quark - level process is the same as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiag ] , but with @xmath56 .",
    "the hadronic current is given by  @xcite , @xmath57t^{\\mu\\nu } \\nonumber \\\\       & & + i f_3(s_1,s_2,q^2 ) \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma }           p_{1\\nu}p_{2\\rho}p_{3\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\       & & + f_4(s_1,s_2,q^2 ) q^\\mu\\ , , \\label{eq : jmu_sm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "several decay chains contribute to the form factors within the sm .",
    "the dominant form factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been studied experimentally by cleo  @xcite .",
    "these form factors receive contributions due to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the subdominant processes @xmath64 and @xmath65 are also possible , and could contribute to @xmath28 .",
    "the scalar form factor , @xmath33 , is expected to be small within the sm .",
    "the np charged higgs contribution may be taken into account by the replacement , @xmath66 where @xmath35 is the pseudoscalar form factor and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are ( possibly complex ) np parameters defined somewhat similarly to @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the @xmath69 case .",
    "we again consider several possible cp asymmetries .",
    "each asymmetry is proportional to @xmath70 ( integrated over phase space ) .",
    "the regular rate asymmetry contains the combination @xmath71 and is thus expected to be very small .",
    "it is also possible to construct other asymmetries by employing various weighting functions when performing the integration over phase space ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this manner",
    "we have constructed two modified rate asymmetries , as well as one tp asymmetry .",
    "the modified rate asymmetries contain the sm hadronic currents @xmath30 and @xmath31 and they require a non - zero relative strong phase between the sm and np amplitudes in order to be non - zero .",
    "the tp asymmetry depends on @xmath28 and does not require a relative strong phase between the interfering amplitudes .",
    "a preliminary numerical analysis of the modified and tp asymmetries indicates that some amount of cancellation tends to occur as one performs the integrations over phase space .",
    "these cancellations would tend to make the asymmetries quite small .",
    "larger asymmetries are possible if one includes extra weighting factors to offset the cancellations .",
    "alternatively , experimentalists could perform fits to differential asymmetries ( such as @xmath72 , for example ) .",
    "our initial study indicates that asymmetries of up to the order of a percent might be possible if the only assumption regarding the np scalar contribution is that it is `` hidden '' in the current experimental uncertainty in the branching ratio . incorporating the cleo bound on the scalar coupling coming from @xmath73  @xcite and making a reasonable estimate for the scalar form factor , we find that the cp asymmetries are likely to be smaller than this . further analysis and refinement of the numerical estimates",

    "@xcite .",
    "[ * note added : * as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and contrary to the statement made above ) , the cleo bound does not actually place a direct constraint on the np coupling considered here . in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the cleo experiment placed a bound on @xmath74 , while @xmath75 probes @xmath76 . for more details",
    ", please see ref .",
    "we have considered cp violation in certain @xmath69 and @xmath77 @xmath8 decays . in both cases",
    "cp violation requires the interference of ( at least ) two amplitudes that have a differing weak phase .",
    "one amplitude is provided by the usual sm w - exchange diagram .",
    "the other amplitude is assumed to be due to a np higgs - exchange diagram .",
    "while the regular rate asymmetries are expected to be very small in these decays , larger asymmetries can be obtained by forming triple products or by considering other modifications to the usual rate asymmetries .",
