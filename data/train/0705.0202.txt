    "the different models with the initial data set one can conclude that at lower energies the sibyll model and at higher energies the qgsjet model are able to describe the correlation consistently , but none of the present models gives a contenting description of the whole data set  @xcite .",
    "crucial parameters in the modeling of hadronic interaction models which can be responsible for these inconsistencies are the total nucleus - air cross - section and the parts of the inelastic and diffractive cross sections leading to shifts of the position of the shower maximum in the atmosphere , and therefore to a change of the muon and electron numbers as well as to their correlation on single air shower basis .",
    "the multiplicity of the pion generation at all energies at the hadronic interactions during the air shower development is also a ` semi - free ' parameter in the air - shower modeling as accelerator data have still large uncertainties .",

    "+ in summary , there are still deficiencies of the hadronic interaction models ( in particular in describing the high energy interactions ) which are revealed by the high accuracy data of kascade . but combining all the correlations , the final observables of the showers have not to be different by more than @xmath31% to be consistent with the data .",
    "this requires rather a fine - tuning of the free parameters in the simulation of the hadronic interactions than a need on new physics .",
    "+ neglecting somehow the uncertainties by the interaction models , kascade used an additional independent and more direct approach to interprete the measurements ( fig .",
    "[ muon ] ) . by using three observables ( one observable as energy identifier - the local muon density of high energy muons ; and two observables as mass identifier - the ratio of electron to low energy muon number for dividing the whole eas sample in a sample generated by light primaries and heavy primaries )",
    "kascade could impressively and in a nearly model independent way demonstrate that the knee is caused by the decreasing flux of light primaries  @xcite .",
    "+ investigations of anisotropies in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays give additional information on the cosmic ray origin and of their propagation .",
    "depending on the model of the origin of the knee and on the assumed structure of the galactic magnetic field one expects large - scale anisotropies on a scale of @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the energy region of the knee .",
    "the limits of large - scale anisotropy analyzing the kascade data are determined to be between @xmath34 at 0.7 pev primary energy and @xmath33 at 6 pev  @xcite .",
    "these limits were obtained by investigations of the rayleigh amplitudes and phases of the first harmonics .",
    "taking into account possible nearby sources of galactic cosmic rays like the vela supernova remnant the limits of kascade already exclude particular model predictions .",
    "the interest for looking to point sources in the kascade data sample arises from the possibility of unknown near - by sources , where the deflection of the charged cosmic rays would be small or by sources emitting neutral particles like high - energy gammas or neutrons .",
    "the scenario for neutrons is very interesting for kascade - grande , since the neutron decay length at these energies is in the order of the distance to the galactic center . in kascade case",
    "no significant excess was found  @xcite .",
    "the highest energies above the so called ankle at a few eev are believed to be exclusively of extragalactic origin .",
    "thus , in the experimentally scarcely explored region between the first ( proton ) knee and the ankle there are two more peculiarities of the cosmic ray spectrum expected : ( i ) a knee of the heavy component which is either expected ( depending on the model ) at the position of the first knee scaled with z ( the charge ) or alternatively with a ( the mass ) of iron .",
    "( ii ) a transition region from galactic to extragalactic origin of cosmic rays , where there is no theoretical reason for a smooth crossover in slope and flux .",

    "it is obvious that for the range between 50 and 1000 pev sophisticated experiments are needed to measure the eas with the same statistical and reconstruction accuracy as the kascade experiment discussed in the previous section .",
    "[ ldfexample ] shows , for a single shower , the lateral distribution of electrons and muons reconstructed with kascade and the charge particle densities measured by the grande stations .",
    "this example illustrates the capabilities of kascade - grande and the high quality of the data .",

    "in particular the possibility to reconstruct the total muon number for grande measured showers is the salient feature of kascade - grande compared to other experiments in this energy range . to describe the lateral distribution ( ldf ) of the muons a lagutin - like function",

    "+ at the kascade experiment , the two - dimensional distribution shower size - truncated number of muons played the fundamental role in reconstruction of energy spectra of single mass groups . hence , figure  [ april04_data ] illustrates the capability of kascade - grande to perform an unfolding procedure like in kascade .",
    "a hundred percent efficiency for kascade - grande is reached for all primary particle types at energies above @xmath35ev , thus providing a large overlap with the kascade energy range .",

    "provide only information on the actual status of the air shower cascade on the particular observation level .",
    "this hampers the determination of the properties of the eas inducing primary as compared to methods like the observation of cherenkov and fluorescence light  @xcite . in order to reduce the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the detection and reconstruction of eas , especially with respect to the detection of cosmic particles of highest energies",
    ", there is a current methodical discussion on new detection techniques . due to technical restrictions in past times",

    "+            the main goal of the investigations in karlsruhe in the frame of lopes is the ` calibration ' of the shower radio emission in the primary energy range of @xmath36ev to @xmath1ev .",

    "this situation provides the coherent emission of the radio signal .",
    "+ when kascade - grande has triggered lopes the processing of the registered lopes data includes several steps  @xcite .",
    "first , the relative instrumental delays are corrected using a known tv transmitter visible in the data .",
    "next , the digital filtering , gain corrections and corrections of the trigger delays based on the known shower direction ( from kascade ) are applied and noisy antennas are flagged .",
    "then a time shift of the data and a correction for the azimuth and zenith dependence of the antenna gain is done and the combination of the data is performed calculating the resulting beam from all antennas .",
    "this digital beam forming allows to place a narrow antenna beam in the direction of the cosmic ray event . to form the beam the data from each pair of antennas",
    "is multiplied time - bin by time - bin , the resulting values are averaged , and then the square root is taken while preserving the sign . the resulting pulse is called the cross - correlation beam or cc - beam .",
    "the finally obtained value @xmath38 , which is the measured amplitude divided by the effective bandwidth , is compared with further shower observables from kascade - grande .",
    "+ the lopes-10 data set is subject of various analyses using different selections : with an event sample obtained by stringent cuts the proof of principle to detect air showers in the radio frequency range was given  @xcite .",
    "with showers fallen inside kascade the basic correlations with shower parameters are shown  @xcite .",
    "as example , fig  [ energy-10 ] depicts the dependence of the reconstructed averaged radio pulse height on the primary energy of the cosmic particles .",
    "the shown correlation supports the expectation that the field strength increases by a power - law with an index close to one with the primary energy , i.e. that the received power of the radio signal increases quadratically with the primary energy of the cosmic rays .",
    "[ geo-10 ] shows the correlation between the normalized reconstructed pulse height of the events with the geomagnetic angle .",
    "normalized here means , that the detected pulse height is corrected for the dependence on the muon number , i.e.  to a large extent , the primary energy , and distance to the shower axis .",
    "the clear correlation found suggests a geomagnetic origin for the emission mechanism  @xcite .",
    "besides the analyses of events with the core inside the antenna set - up , kascade - grande gives the possibility to search for distant events .",
    "for each ( large ) shower triggering kascade , the information from the extension of kascade , i.e.  from the grande array , is available .",
    "from that information the shower can be reconstructed even if the core is outside the original kascade area , and a radio signal can be searched for events which have distances up to @xmath39 m from the center of the antenna set - up .",
    "lopes-10 detects clear eas radio events at more than @xmath40 m distance from the shower axis for primary energies below @xmath1ev .",
    "that itself is a remarkable result , but in addition , an important issue is the functional form of the dependence of the radio field strength with distance to the shower axis . after linear scaling of the pulse amplitude with the primary energy estimated by kascade - grande a clear correlation with the mean distance of the shower axis to the antennas",
    "is found ( fig .",
    "[ dist-10 ] ) .",
    "this correlation can be described by an exponential function with a scaling radius in the order of a few hundred meters  @xcite .",
    "further interesting features are investigated with a sample of very inclined showers  @xcite .",
    "the sample is of special interest for a large scale application of this detection technique , as due to the low attenuation in the atmosphere also very inclined showers should be detectable with high efficiency . with lopes one could show that events above @xmath41 zenith angle still emit a detectable radio signal .",

    "the finding is that during thunderstorms the radio emission can be strongly enhanced ( fig .",

    "<S> the karlsruhe multi - detector set - ups kascade , kascade - grande , and lopes aim on measurements of cosmic rays in the energy range of the so called knee between @xmath0ev and @xmath1ev . </S>",
    "<S> the multidimensional analysis of the air shower data measured by kascade indicates a distinct knee in the energy spectra of light primary cosmic rays and an increasing dominance of heavy ones towards higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> this provides , together with the results of large scale anisotropy studies , implications for discriminating astrophysical models of the origin of the knee . to improve the reconstruction quality and statistics at higher energies , where the knee of the heavy primaries is expected at around 100 pev </S>",
    "<S> , kascade has been extended by a factor 10 in area to the new experiment kascade - grande . </S>",
    "<S> lopes is located on site of the kascade - grande experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it measures radio pulses from extensive air showers with the goal to establish this renewed detection technique for future large scale experiments . </S>"
