    "we investigate possible further improvements to the bound for the special case of @xmath11 .",
    "this can be considered the smallest nontrivial choice of @xmath8 , since the zero sets of univariate binomials are easily characterized - they are simply cosets of subgroups of @xmath12 , possibly together with @xmath13 .",

    "most notably , the question of optimality of the bound remains open for the prime field case .",
    "we remark that out of all examples of which we are aware , including those given in @xcite , the only sparse polynomials which vanish at a substantial number of points do so by abusing some obvious algebraic structure of @xmath20 - they either vanish on an entire translation of a subspace or on an entire coset of a nontrivial subgroup .",

    "therefore , it may be that the observed logarithmic growth of @xmath56 is not due to any special property of trinomials with @xmath43 , but rather emerges as a statistical consequence of this set being so  ordinary , \" together with the exponential decay of the poisson distribution .",

    "if these two distributions do in fact differ by at most a constant factor , then we are able to readily derive the logarithmic upper bound for @xmath56 suggested by our experiments . and",

    "then , we have the asymptotic bound @xmath86    let @xmath87 and @xmath88 so that @xmath89    we can bound @xmath90 from above by counting polynomials of the form @xmath91 with @xmath92 distinct , which gives @xmath93 obviously @xmath94 , so assuming the existence of @xmath95 defined in conjecture [ con ] , we have @xmath96 if @xmath97 then the set @xmath98 is empty ,",
