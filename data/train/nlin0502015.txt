    "beginning with the pioneering contributions by kuramoto @xcite and winfree @xcite , studies of synchronization and spatiotemporal chaos ( turbulence ) in populations of coupled active oscillators have developed into a classical field of research . in chemical systems ,",
    "each oscillator represents a reaction element and coupling between such elements is usually due to diffusion of reactants in the system .",
    "this coupling extends only within a short diffusion length and is therefore local .",
    "the complex ginzburg - landau equation is the canonical model for oscillatory systems with local coupling near a supercritical hopf bifurcation . in surface chemical reactions @xcite",
    ", reaction elements are however additionally interacting through the gas phase where instantaneous complete mixing occurs . as a result ,",
    "global coupling between chemical oscillators arises @xcite .",
    "moreover , global delayed feedbacks through the gas phase could be artificially introduced to control turbulence in surface reactions @xcite . a special class of systems are arrays of active oscillators that do not directly interact one with another , but are all coupled to a single diffusing field ( in biochemistry , an example of such a system would be provided by arrays of allosteric enzymes interacting through a chemical messenger @xcite ) . adiabatically eliminating this field ,",
    "models with nonlocal coupling between the oscillators , described by a finite - range integral , were derived @xcite .",
    "investigations of nonlocally coupled oscillator arrays have revealed that such form of coupling does not always synchronize neighbouring oscillators and discontinuous distributions with scaleless fractal structure can develop @xcite .",
    "spatiotemporal chaos can develop in such systems even in the benjamin - feir stable regime @xcite and spiral waves with phase - randomized cores can exist here @xcite .",
    "furthermore , arrays with both local and nonlocal coupling between oscillators are possible .",
    "this situation is characteristic , for example , for surface chemical reactions .",
    "in such systems , diffusion provides local coupling between neighbouring surface oscillators , whereas much faster heat conduction is responsible for nonlocal coupling between them .",
    "recently , tanaka and kuramoto @xcite have shown how , in the vicinity of a supercritical hopf bifurcation , the description of arrays of nonlocally coupled oscillators can be reduced to the complex ginzburg - landau equation with nonlocal coupling . because of the critical slowing down near the bifurcation point , the coupling is effectively instantaneous in the reduced description .    in realistic systems , which are not too close to the hopf bifurcation ,",
    "one can however also encounter the opposite situation , with a very slow inertial field giving rise to nonlocal coupling .",
    "the aim of our study is to analyze what new effects , primarily due to slow nonlocal coupling , are possible in this class of systems . for our investigations",
    ", we have chosen an abstract model of the complex ginzburg - landau equation interacting with an additional slow field , so that the coupling is nonlocal both with respect to space and time .",
    "we expect that the behaviour found in this general model would be typical for a broad class of realistic systems .",
    "the principal effect of coupling inertiality is that birhythmicity , leading to chaotic intermittency , can develop in such systems .",
    "in contrast to the birhythmicity in reaction - diffusion systems near a pitchfork - hopf bifurcation ( see @xcite ) , the two oscillatory states are characterized here by very different frequencies and oscillation amplitudes . for the rapid oscillatory state , the additional field responsible for the inertial long - range coupling is almost absent and only diffusive local coupling between the oscillators is important . in slow oscillations",
    ", the elements are however entrained by the long - range inertial field .",
    "depending on the parameters , two new kinds of intermittency are found here .",
    "when rapid oscillations are modulationally unstable and give rise to turbulence , spatial regions occupied by slow entrained oscillations spontaneously develop and die out in the medium .",
    "they can be interpreted as bursts of synchronization on a turbulent background . on the other hand ,",
    "relatively small , irregularly evolving islands filled with rapid turbulence can persist on the background of slow almost uniform oscillations .",
    "they can be therefore described as bursts of desynchronization on the background of regular slow oscillations .",
    "our analysis of such phenomena is based on the phase dynamics approximation , derived for the birhythmic system .",
    "it is complemented by 1d and 2d numerical simulations .",
    "the investigated model describes a system of diffusively coupled active oscillators coupled to an additional inertial diffusive field . introducing the local complex oscillation amplitude @xmath0 and denoting as @xmath1 the additional complex - valued diffusive field , we have therefore a system of two equations    @xmath2    [ model ]    the additional last term in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( [ model : one ] ) takes into account coupling of the oscillatory subsystem with the field @xmath3 whose evolution obeys equation ( [ model : two ] ) ; @xmath4 is the respective coupling constant .",
    "the equations are brought into a dimensionless form by choosing the characteristic diffusion length in the oscillatory subsystem as the length unit and taking the characteristic relaxation time scale of the oscillators as the time unit .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 determine characteristic time and length scales of the additional field @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that this field is inertial ( @xmath7 ) and slowly varying in space ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the linear equation ( [ model : two ] ) can easily be solved as @xmath9 where the kernel is given by @xmath10 substituting this into equation ( [ model : one ] ) , we obtain an equivalent integro - differential form of the considered model , @xmath11 dx^{\\prime } dt^{\\prime } \\label{integralform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that , besides of diffusion , the model also includes an additional coupling , nonlocal both with respect to space and time .    note that very close to a supercritical hopf bifurcation all processes become fast as compared to the relaxation time scale of individual oscillators , because this time is inversely proportional to the distance from the bifurcation point ( critical slowing down ) .",
    "however , it is known that the complex ginzburg - landau equation yields qualitatively correct description even relatively far from the bifurcation . equations ( [ model ] ) and ( [ integralform ] ) can be viewed as providing a simple model of an oscillating system coupled to an inertial diffusive field .",
    "the system described by equations ( [ model ] ) is birhythmic , i.e. it can have two different oscillatory uniform states . assuming that @xmath12 and @xmath13 and substituting this into equations ( [ model : one ] ) and ( [ model : two ] ) , we obtain a cubic equation for the oscillation frequency @xmath14 , @xmath15    when the frequency @xmath16 is known , the oscillation amplitude @xmath17 of the field @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 the respective oscillation amplitude of the field @xmath3 is @xmath20 depending on its parameters , equation ( [ 3rd_order ] ) can have either one or three real roots .",
    "the three roots correspond to three possible modes of uniform oscillations with frequencies @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 .",
    "it can be checked that oscillations with the middle frequency @xmath23 are always unstable .",
    "in contrast to this , uniform oscillations with frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 are possible ( but may still be unstable with respect to nonuniform perturbations , see the discussion below ) .    figure [ ak_bif ] shows the region in the parameter planes ( @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 ) where birhythmicity exists .",
    "the birhythmicity is possible only for sufficiently strong coupling @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it develops only if the characteristic time @xmath5 of the field @xmath3 is sufficiently large ( fig .",
    "[ tk_bif ] ) .",
    "numerical solutions of equation ( [ 3rd_order ] ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ bif_diag ] .",
    "if the parameter @xmath28 is kept constant and the coupling strength @xmath4 is varied ( fig .",
    "[ bif_k ] ) , birhythmicity is found inside the interval @xmath29 . when @xmath30 the system has a stable stationary state coexisting with oscillations .",
    "the dependence of the effective oscillation frequency @xmath16 on the difference @xmath31 for @xmath32 is shown in fig.[bif_a ] .",
    "two stable limit cycles coexist within the interval @xmath33 .",
    "the difference between the two limit cycles becomes clear if we compare the amplitudes of oscillations of the fields @xmath18 and @xmath3 which are presented below in the same figures .",
    "as we have already observed , at @xmath34 only one oscillating mode is present , as we are in this limit reduced to the standard cgle .",
    "thus , we can expect that the branch starting at @xmath34 ( which is the upper one in the bifurcation diagrams of fig .",
    "[ bif_diag ] ) would have the strongest similarities to the cgle , even though for finite @xmath4 it would be affected by the coupling to the second field .",
    "this branch is characterized by a large amplitude of the field @xmath18 , which never gets significantly smaller than 1 .",
    "the corresponding frequency is quite small , starting from @xmath35 at @xmath34 and slowly decreasing as @xmath4 increases .",
    "below , we refer to this attractor as corresponding to the _ slow _ limit cycle .",
    "in contrast to this , oscillations in the lower branch have a smaller amplitude @xmath17 , which decreases for higher coupling strengths @xmath4 and eventually vanishes at @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is negative for this mode and therefore such oscillations are counter - rotating with respect to the upper branch .",
    "the frequency varies significantly for this mode . inside the birhythmicity interval ,",
    "the frequency of such _ rapid _ limit cycle is always much larger ( in its magnitude ) than the frequency of the slow mode .",
    "a characteristic feature of the rapid limit cycle is that the amplitude @xmath37 of the field @xmath3 is very small here .",
    "this is because the oscillations of the field @xmath18 are so rapid here that the inertial field @xmath3 can not respond to them .",
    "hence , the coupling term @xmath38 in the system ( [ model ] ) is almost negligible for the rapid limit cycle so that the nonlocal coupling is ineffective and oscillators interact only via the local diffusional coupling in this mode .",
    "above , uniform oscillations in the model have been discussed .",
    "now , we want to consider the properties of _ almost _ uniform oscillations , characterized by small phase gradients .",
    "because the system is invariant with respect to the uniform shift of all phases , the evolution of phase distributions with small phase gradients should be slow , in contrast to fast local relaxation of the amplitude perturbations .",
    "therefore , a reduced description , known as the phase dynamics approximation , can be constructed in such cases @xcite . when birhythmicity is present , the coefficients of the phase dynamics equation are different for the two oscillation modes .    the derivation of the phase dynamics equation for this system is lengthy and has been performed by using a computer program for algebraic calculations ( _ mathematica _ ) . below in this section we show the scheme of derivation and discuss the results .",
    "the complete derivation is presented in appendix a.    we define the phases ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and amplitudes ( @xmath17 and @xmath37 ) of complex fields @xmath18 and @xmath3 as @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "it is convenient to use instead of @xmath43 and @xmath44 the variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that the phase sum @xmath47 is the slow variable in this system .",
    "the phases of the two fields are rigidly correlated in the uniform state and their difference @xmath48 undergoes rapid relaxation , similar to oscillation amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath3 .    in terms of the new variables ,",
    "the model ( [ model ] ) takes the form    @xmath49    [ four ]    suppose now that the birhythmic system is close to one of its two oscillatory states , characterized by some amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the relative phase @xmath52 , whereas the phase sum @xmath47 remains arbitrary .",
    "if the phase sum @xmath47 is slowly varying in space , the variables @xmath17 , @xmath37 and @xmath48 would only slightly deviate from their equilibrium values . therefore , we can introduce small perturbations of such variables , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and linearize the equations for with respect to such perturbations .",
    "the linearized evolution equation for the phase @xmath56 is @xmath57\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\delta r\\left(-\\frac{k}{\\rho_0}-\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\tau r_0 ^ 2}\\right ) \\sin \\psi_0+\\delta\\psi\\left(-\\frac{kr_0}{\\rho_0 } + \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\tau r_0}\\right ) \\cos\\psi_0\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\nabla\\theta^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{l^2}{\\tau}\\right)\\nabla^2\\theta \\label{sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the linearized equations for the variables @xmath58 can be solved in the adiabatic approximation , because these fast variables are adjusting to slow variation of @xmath47 . substituting the result into ( [ sum ] ) , a closed evolution equation for the phase variable @xmath56 is derived .",
    "this equation has the form : @xmath59 the analytical expressions for the coefficients @xmath60 @xmath61 are given in appendix a. note that inside the birhythmic region there are two uniform oscillation modes with different @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath62 , and thus with different values of these coefficients .",
    "the most important coefficient is @xmath63 because its sign controls stability of uniform oscillations with respect to phase modulation ( the benjamin - feir instability ) . if @xmath64 , uniform oscillations are stable , if @xmath65 they are unstable .",
    "we have computed this coefficient as functions of several model parameters , by using the obtained analytical expressions .",
    "the computed dependences are shown in fig .",
    "[ coeff2 ] .",
    "two different branches correspond to the two different limit cycles .",
    "the upper curves in fig .",
    "[ coeff2](a , b , d ) are for the slow mode , whereas the lower curves are for the rapid oscillations . in fig .",
    "[ coeff2](c ) , the upper curves correspond to the slow mode for larger values of the parameter @xmath6 .     +    examining these plots ,",
    "several observations can be made : slow mode oscillations are always stable inside the birhythmic region , even when the system without coupling is benjamin - feir unstable ( i.e. , @xmath66 and therefore @xmath65 at @xmath34 ) .",
    "in contrast to this , rapid oscillations are always unstable when the condition @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "moreover , they are unstable near the boundary of the birhythmic region , at which they first appear , even when this condition is violated .",
    "increasing the diffusion length @xmath6 of the field @xmath3 favors instability of rapid uniform oscillations .",
    "to investigate nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics in the considered model , simulations of equations ( [ model : one ] ) and ( [ model : two ] ) have been performed . for numerical integration of these equations , the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm has been used . the mesh size for space discretization and the time step",
    "have been chosen to optimize the computational time for each parameter choice . since the diffusion length and the diffusion constant of the oscillatory field",
    "have both been chosen to be equal to unity , @xmath67 varied between 0.3 and 0.5 , while @xmath68 could vary between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "both one- and two - dimensional systems were investigated .",
    "no - flux boundary conditions were employed .",
    "initial conditions varied depending on a particular simulation .    to display the results of one - dimensional simulations ,",
    "space - time diagrams have been constructed .",
    "in such diagrams , time always runs along the horizontal axis and the vertical axis is corresponding to the spatial coordinate . in two dimensions , snapshots at some time moments and space - time diagrams showing evolution of the pattern along some linear cross - section are presented .",
    "the patterns are shown by using a gray scale where the white color encodes the smallest and the black color the largest values of the displayed variable .",
    "first , the behavior of fronts separating spatial regions with two different oscillatory states in the birhythmic system has been studied ( fig . [ front ] ) .",
    "the front travels towards the slow oscillating region , in such a way that the system ends up with uniform oscillations of the rapid mode .",
    "its propagation is characterized by periodic appearance of amplitude defects which occur when the phase difference between the two oscillating regions equals @xmath71 ( see fig [ front : a25 ] ) .",
    "the front moves at a constant velocity which depends on the parameters of the system .",
    "[ front_vel_a ] shows the dependence of the front velocity on the parameter @xmath72 for several values of the coupling strength @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ front_vel_dom ] , the dependence of the front propagation velocity on the frequency difference @xmath73 of two uniform oscillatory modes is presented .",
    "the front always moves faster when this difference is increased .    as follows from the stability analysis of uniform oscillatory states ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ coeff2:a ] ) , rapid oscillations should be unstable with respect to phase modulation near the birhythmicity boundary and complex spatiotemporal regimes can be expected there .",
    "we have performed a series of numerical simulations , exploring pattern formation in the system within the intervals @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while keeping fixed the other parameters ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "each simulation started from independently chosen , completely random initial conditions .",
    "figure [ phasediagram ] is a schematic summary of these numerical investigations .",
    "the solid line is the stability boundary of rapid oscillations ( @xmath78 ) ; rapid oscillations are unstable below this boundary .",

    "examples of typical spatiotemporal patterns , observed in one - dimensional simulations within each region , are displayed in fig .",

    "[ des_bursts_second ] . inside the domains , the coupling field @xmath3",
    "is reduced in magnitude and these small spatial regions are filled with irregular rapid variations of the complex field @xmath18 .",
    "thus , they can be classified as desynchronization bursts .",
    "the space - time diagrams through one horizontal cross section of the medium ( right panels in fig .",
    "[ des_bursts_second ] ) show that such domains can spread or shrink , and travel through the medium .",
    "the edges of these structures are marked by the appearance of amplitude defects where @xmath82 is close to zero .",
    "remarkably , if we keep fixed all other parameter values , but eliminate diffusional coupling between the oscillators ( the laplacian term in equation ( [ model : one ] ) ) , evolution starting from the same initial conditions leads to spiral waves with phase - randomized cores , similar to those which were previously considered @xcite .",
    "thus , the inclusion of diffusive coupling has a strong effect on pattern formation in the system .",
    "though patterns resembling spiral waves with phase - randomized core are indeed initially developing in the diffusively coupled case , they are unstable and , after a transient , lead to the development of intermittent spatiotemporal regimes with desynchronization bursts .",
    "our study can be viewed as an extension of a series of detailed investigations of systems with nonlocal coupling between oscillators performed by y. kuramoto with his coworkers .",
    "we have chosen the model ( [ model ] ) , which belongs to the previously discussed class , and focused our analysis on the effects of coupling inertiality and diffusion in this model .",
    "the principal effect of the inertiality in nonlocal coupling is that the system becomes birhythmic and has uniform slow and rapid oscillations as two different coexisting attractors .    for rapid oscillations , the inertial field @xmath3 responsible for nonlocal coupling",
    "is not excited and the system is essentially reduced to an array of only diffusively coupled oscillators with amplitudes @xmath18 . in contrast to this , the nonlocal coupling field @xmath3 is involved in slow oscillations and nonlocal coupling between oscillators is in operation under these conditions .",
    "our stability analysis based on the phase dynamics equation has shown that , though slow uniform oscillations are always stable in the considered model , rapid uniform oscillations may become modulationally unstable near the birhythmicity boundary .",
    "traveling fronts , separating spatial regions with two different oscillation modes , have been seen in our numerical simulations .",
    "note that the fronts separating oscillating and non - oscillating regions have been recently observed in the vicinity of a subcritical hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "irregular intermittent spatiotemporal regimes of two different kinds have been numerically observed . in the patterns with synchronization bursts ,",
    "the background is occupied by rapid chaotic oscillations . on this background ,",
    "short - living small domains with slow and rather uniform oscillations spontaneously develop . inside such domains ,",
    "the nonlocal coupling field is much larger in magnitude than for the rapidly oscillating background .",
    "the characteristic size of such domains was comparable to the nonlocality radius in the model .",
    "this kind of intermittent turbulence is to some extent similar to the behavior observed for a system near the andronov homoclinic bifurcation , exhibiting bistability between a stationary and an oscillatory state @xcite .",
    "however , the developing domains are filled here not by a stationary state , but by slow oscillations .    in the spatiotemporal patterns with desynchronization bursts ,",
    "the background is occupied by slow oscillations which are almost uniform . on this background",
    ", a cascade of desynchronization bursts develops .",
    "each burst represents a localized turbulent spot filled with rapid irregular oscillations . inside it ,",
    "the nonlocal coupling field is reduced in magnitude .",
    "such patterns correspond to the regimes of intermittent localized turbulence previously seen for the complex ginzburg - landau equation with global coupling @xcite , in the experiments with global delayed feedback in surface chemical reactions @xcite and in the respective realistic simulations @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "they develop in the situations when rotating spiral waves with phase - randomized cores have been seen @xcite in systems where only nonlocal coupling was present .",
