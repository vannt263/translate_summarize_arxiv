    "the presence of neutrons in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their possible role for the observed emission was realized in the past few years ( derishev , kocharovsky , & kocharovsky 1999a , b ; bahcall & mszros 2000 ; mszros & rees 2000 ; fuller , pruet , & abazajian 2000 ; pruet & dalal 2002 ) . in an accompanying paper , we study in detail the nuclear composition of grb fireballs and show that the presence of neutrons among the ejected baryons is practically inevitable ( beloborodov 2003 , paper  1 ) .",
    "one implication is an observable multi - gev neutrino emission from inelastic neutron - ion collisions in the fireball . here ,",
    "we focus on a different aspect .",
    "we show that the neutrons have a dramatic impact on the explosion dynamics at radii as large as @xmath5  cm and propose a novel mechanism for grb afterglow emission .",
    "let us remind what happens in a relativistic explosion without neutrons ( see mszros 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the ejected fireball with mass @xmath6 and lorentz factor @xmath7 sweeps up an ambient medium and gradually dissipates its kinetic energy .",
    "the dissipation rate peaks at a characteristic `` deceleration '' radius @xmath8 where half of the initial energy is dissipated .",
    "this radius corresponds to swept - up mass @xmath9 .",
    "further dynamics is described by the self - similar blast wave model of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) .",
    "how does this picture change in the presence of neutrons ?",
    "neutrons develop a lorentz factor @xmath10 at the very beginning of the explosion when the fireball is accelerated by radiation pressure ( derishev et al .",
    "they are collisionally coupled to the ions in the early dense fireball , and decouple close to the end of the acceleration stage .",
    "then the neutrons coast and gradually decay with a mean lifetime @xmath11  s and a mean decay radius @xmath12 , [ eq : h ] = 0.810 ^ 16 ( )  cm .    at radii under consideration , @xmath13  cm , the ejected fireball is a shell of thickness @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast to neutrons , the ion component of the fireball is aware of the external medium and its lorentz factor @xmath15 decreases .",
    "as @xmath15 decreases below @xmath0 , the ions fall behind and separate from the neutrons .",
    "thus the fireball splits into two relativistic shells which we name n ( neutrons ) and i ( ions ) ; the n - shell will also be called `` neutron front '' .",
    "the i - shell lags behind by a distance @xmath16 , [ eq : l ] -- , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the shell velocities in units of @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    ", we hereafter focus on the stage of complete separation @xmath20 ( it sets in right after the beginning of the i - shell deceleration if @xmath21  cm , and it covers the whole explosion if @xmath22 ) .",
    "the mass of the n - shell gradually decreases because of the @xmath23-decay , [ eq : mn ] m_n(r)=m_n^0(- ) .",
    "however , even at @xmath24 , the n - shell energy @xmath25 is huge compared to the ambient rest mass @xmath26 . for example , at @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the neutron decay products @xmath30 and @xmath31 share immediately their huge momentum with ambient particles due to two - stream instability ( the instability timescale is set by the ion plasma frequency @xmath32 and it is the shortest timescale in the problem ) .",
    "thus , the n - shell leaves behind a mixed trail with a relativistic bulk velocity @xmath33 which we calculate now .",
    "let @xmath34 be ambient mass overtaken by the n - shell as it passes @xmath35 and @xmath36 be mass of decayed neutrons .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 share momentum and form a trail element with proper mass @xmath39 which includes heat dissipated in the inelastic @xmath37-@xmath38 collision .",
    "the laws of energy and momentum conservation read @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the trail lorentz factor .",
    "let us denote [ eq : zet ] ( r)= = ( ) ^-1 . from equations  ( [ eq : laws ] ) we find [",
    "eq : beta ] ( r)= , ( r)=. it gives @xmath1 until essentially all neutrons have decayed . for illustration ,",
    "let us specialize to a power - law density profile of the ambient medium .",
    "then [ eq : m ] m(r)=()^k , ( r)=()^1-k , and @xmath42 evolves from @xmath43 at @xmath44 to @xmath45 at @xmath46 as @xmath47 decays exponentially .",
    "there exists a characteristic radius @xmath48 where the trail becomes nonrelativistic ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is defined by condition @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : beta ] ) , which requires about 10 e - folds of the decay ( for a typical @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus , 10=0.810 ^ 17 ( )  cm .",
    "@xmath48 depends very weakly ( logarithmically ) on the ambient density and @xmath52 .",
    "now that we know @xmath23 , the trail density @xmath53 can be easily calculated .",
    "the neutron front has a small thickness @xmath54 and the ambient particles cross it almost instantaneously ( on timescale @xmath55 ) .",
    "measured in the n - shell frame , the flux of ambient particles is @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are proper densities of the ambient particles ahead and behind the n - shell , respectively .",
    "this gives the medium compression as it is accelerated in the neutron front : @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the total density of the trail includes the neutron decay products , so @xmath60 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) , we get [ eq : n ] = = ( 1+)(^2 + 2 + 1)^1/2 . the energy dissipated in the neutron front is given by @xmath61 after simple algebra ( using eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : laws ] ] ) , we find [ eq : en ] = c^2 .",
    "it simplifies to @xmath62 for the interesting regime @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the trail is formed very hot .",
    "this can be seen when comparing inertial mass @xmath65 ( that includes heat ) with rest mass @xmath66 , which gives dimensionless relativistic enthalpy [ eq : mu ] = = .",
    "for @xmath64 we find @xmath67 , i.e. internal energy of the trail far exceeds its rest - mass energy .",
    "the trail parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    ".trail parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is instructive to view the dissipation process in the rest frame of the trail . here , the elements @xmath37 and @xmath38 have initial lorentz factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 , share their opposite momenta , and come at rest .",
    "this is achieved via a plasma instability that isotropizes the particle momentum distribution .",
    "it may result in two isotropic ion populations in the trail : ambient ions with mean lorentz factor @xmath68 and @xmath23-decay protons with mean lorentz factor @xmath70 .",
    "both populations are relativistically hot , @xmath1 and @xmath71 , as long as @xmath64 .",
    "they have equal energies @xmath72 ( which correspond to equal relativistic bulk momenta of @xmath38 and @xmath37 before they come at rest in the trail frame ) .",
    "the ratio of their temperatures is the reciprocal of their density ratio .    a detailed model of dissipation in the neutron front is an interesting plasma physics problem , which we defer to a future work .",
    "we emphasize here that it is different from dissipation in collisionless shocks .",
    "the thickness of a shock , @xmath73 , is set by the timescale of two - stream instability , and it is a discontinuity in the hydrodynamical sense .",
    "by contrast , the n - shell has thickness @xmath74  cm which is orders of magnitude larger than @xmath75 .",
    "the neutrons decay and cause dissipation everywhere in the n - shell .",
    "the ion medium velocity grows smoothly from 0 at the leading edge of the neutron front to @xmath23 at its trailing edge .",
    "this can be called `` volume dissipation '' .",
    "the ion fireball follows the neutron front and collects the trail . as a result , ( 1 ) the ion lorentz factor @xmath15 decreases and ( 2 ) a shock wave propagates in the trail material .",
    "the shock has a lorentz factor @xmath76 and can not catch up with the neutron front ( unless @xmath77 $ ] falls off steeper than @xmath78 ) .",
    "the shock lags behind the neutron front by distance @xmath79 and its time lag is [ eq : tsw ] = . it is much shorter than @xmath80 as long as @xmath81 .",
    "hereafter we use the approximation @xmath82 and assume that the trail is quickly picked up by the shock , before it could expand and change its density or velocity . we allow , however , for rapid radiative losses of the trail : it may cool on a timescale @xmath83 and possibly @xmath84 .",
    "below we consider two extreme regimes : @xmath85 ( adiabatic ) and @xmath86 ( radiative with @xmath87 ) .    in the radiative regime , the energy dissipated by the shock is = ( -1)(1+)c^2 , where @xmath88 is the trail lorentz factor with respect to the i - shell . for @xmath89",
    "one can use approximate expressions @xmath90 and @xmath91 to get @xmath92 . note that the dissipation is smaller than it would be in the absence of the neutron front , @xmath93 .",
    "hence , in the radiative regime , the neutrons delay the deceleration of the ion fireball .    in the adiabatic regime , the preshock material has a high enthalpy @xmath94 given by equation  ( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "the postshock heat , measured in the lab frame , is @xmath95 .",
    "it includes heat deposited into the preshock medium by the neutron front ( eq .  [ eq : den ] ) , which should be subtracted to get the energy dissipated in the shock itself .",
    "hence , [ eq : esh ] = ( 1+)c^2 . for @xmath89",
    "we get @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the total dissipated energy @xmath98 . as long as @xmath99 , the bulk of energy is dissipated in the shock rather than in the neutron front . moreover , the dissipated energy is the same as in the absence of a neutron front , and hence the fireball deceleration is the same .    in both radiative and adiabatic regimes ,",
    "the shock dissipation is suppressed when the blast wave decelerates to @xmath100 . at @xmath101",
    "the shock would disappear .",
    "thus , @xmath15 is bound from below by @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider the simple radiative regime .",
    "the i - shell and the shocked part of the trail can be treated as a single shell with a growing mass @xmath102 ( a known function of radius ) and a decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "mass gain @xmath103 causes deceleration @xmath104 that is found from the energy and momentum conservation : @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the radiated energy . excluding @xmath108",
    ", we get the dynamic equation , [ eq : dyn ] m = -^2(-)(1 + ) . using equations  ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] )",
    "we can solve numerically equation  ( [ eq : dyn ] ) for @xmath109 with an initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the results depend on the type of the ambient medium .",
    "figure  1 shows two examples : a standard ism and a wind from a wolf - rayet progenitor .",
    "the radiative explosion has two separate emission regions : behind the neutron front and behind the shock front .",
    "their luminosities equal the corresponding dissipation rates @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the neutron front dissipation peaks at @xmath112 .",
    "the shock dissipation can have two peaks ( if @xmath113 as in the wind example in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the first peak marks the beginning of the i - shell deceleration , and it is followed by a minimum when @xmath15 approaches @xmath68 . at @xmath114 , @xmath68 falls down steeply and the shock becomes strong again ( high @xmath115 ) , leading to the second peak at @xmath4 .",
    "dynamics of neutron - fed explosions is a clean physical problem : existence of neutrons in grbs and their mean lifetime of 15  min is all we needed to construct the model .",
    "we focused here on the simple case where all neutrons have equal lorentz factor @xmath116 , and data may require a multi - shell picture with variable @xmath116 .",
    "this extension could affect our model in case of high variations @xmath117 ( though at large @xmath118 , where neutrons die out exponentially , it is sufficient to consider a highest @xmath119 as slower neutrons have shorter lifetimes and their population is smaller by @xmath120 $ ] ) .",
    "another simple extension is beamed ejecta .",
    "then at late stages the ion fireball spreads laterally while the neutron beaming remains constant .",
    "in contrast to dynamics , emission is really complicated . in general , radiation from collisionless blast waves is not derived from first principles , and neutrons do not make the problem simpler .",
    "the afterglow emission is believed to be synchrotron , and it depends on poorly understood generation of magnetic field and electron acceleration .",
    "the standard model without neutrons relies on the field generation in the shock by the two - stream instability ( sagdeev 1966 , medvedev & loeb 1999 , gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "the shock front is , however , extremely thin ( @xmath121 ) , and the postshock field decays quickly .",
    "the model needs a significant remnant field in an extended layer behind the shock , which is uncertain .",
    "this problem is alleviated in neutron - fed explosions . here",
    ", the leading neutron front is an additional dissipation region maintained in a turbulent state with generated magnetic fields .",
    "the n - shell has thickness @xmath54 comparable to @xmath122 .",
    "it can produce a significant synchrotron radiation by itself  s and it can be related to smooth ( fast - rise - exponential - decay ) pulses in prompt grbs . ] and leave behind remnant fields and hot plasma to be used by the ensuing shock wave for afterglow emission .",
    "we emphasize differences from a customary external shock : the neutron - trail shock propagates in a relativistically moving , dense , hot , and possibly magnetized medium .",
    "the fate of magnetic fields in such shocks and the resulting emission is an interesting issue for a future study .",
    "the neutron impact ceases at @xmath123  cm , which can leave an imprint on the observed afterglow .",
    "for example , the shock dissipation can have a bump ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "and a spectral transition is also possible .",
    "the arrival time of radiation emitted at @xmath48 is @xmath124 ( counted from the arrival of first @xmath68-rays ) .",
    "it may be as long as 30 days or as short as a few seconds , depending on the fireball lorentz factor @xmath125 .",
    "remarkably , @xmath48 is almost independent of the ambient medium , and its observational signature would give information on @xmath125 .",
    "recent early observation of a grb afterglow ( grb  021004 ) discovered an interesting re - brightening at @xmath126  s which would correspond to @xmath127 . also , we do not exclude a possible relevance of neutrons to the 20  day bumps observed in a few grbs , as the time coincides with @xmath128 .",
    "neutron signatures should be absent if the fireball is strongly dominated by a poynting flux and has extremely low baryon loading .",
    "then the neutron component decouples early , with a modest lorentz factor @xmath116 , and decays at small radii .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath116 due to decoupling is @xmath129 where @xmath130 [ g / s ] is the mass outflow rate per unit solid angle of the fireball ( see   4.1 in paper  1 ) .",
    "we focused here on the neutron front and did not account for the @xmath68-ray precursor that impacts the blast wave dynamics at @xmath131  cm , where @xmath132 [ erg ] is the isotropic energy of the grb ( see beloborodov 2002 and refs . therein ) . the analysis in this letter",
    "is strictly valid for afterglows emitted at @xmath133 .",
    "then the radiation - front effects , including the gap opening at @xmath134 , occur at smaller radii , and apply to an earlier afterglow . for a dense medium , where @xmath135",
    ", effects of the neutron and @xmath68-ray fronts should be studied together .",
    "i am grateful to p.  goldreich , r.  blandford , and tapir group for their hospitality during my stay at caltech , where part of this work was done .",
