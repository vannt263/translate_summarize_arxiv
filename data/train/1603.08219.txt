    "in last years of his scientific activity , howard brandt paid a significant attention to questions of quantum cryptography .",
    "quantum cryptography provides a long - term solution to the problem of communication security @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "brandt addressed the problem of optimizing eavesdropper s probe for attacking the bb84 protocol of quantum key distribution .",
    "the bb84 protocol @xcite is probably the most known scheme of quantum key distribution .",
    "one of approaches to eavesdropping is connected with unambiguous state discrimination @xcite . in a version of the b92 scheme ,",
    "the two carriers are distinguished by the povm for unambiguous state discrimination @xcite . a photonic implementation of such povms is considered in @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite addressed the case , when eve tries to get data from her probe by means of unambiguous discrimination . it must be stressed that an efficiency of eavesdropping also depends on the used reconciliation method @xcite .    as was discussed in @xcite",
    ", the bb84 protocol may sometimes have a vulnerability analogous to the well - known vulnerability of the b92 protocol .",
    "the latter has further been considered in @xcite . here , the principal point concerns the effect of the inconclusive answer . to take it into account correctly",
    ", we should choose a proper information - theoretic measure .",
    "using the so - called `` rnyi mutual information '' , the author of @xcite found a certain weakness of the attack modification with unambiguous discrimination in comparison with the usual one . we will show that the amount of this weakness is essentially token in character .",
    "indeed , it is considerably determined by the chosen entropic order in the measure of mutual information .",
    "the made comparison provides an interesting example , which helps to reveal some inadequacy of the widely used measure of mutual information .",
    "since it reflects existing distinctions in information - theoretic properties , we also need in a detailed discussion of used quantities .",
    "the contribution of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we aim to justify that the standard mutual information seems to be a preferred measure in estimating a performance of eavesdropper s probe . at least , it is better in studies of conclusive eavesdropping .",
    "second , we motivate that the modified attack with unambiguous state discrimination is still of interest and deserves further investigations .",
    "security of systems for quantum key distribution against eavesdropping is a difficult problem with many facets .",
    "security analysis should take into account many scenarios possible in practice . to understand various aspects deeper ,",
    "we prefer to consider them separately . in the present paper",
    ", we will focus on possible ways to quantify an information obtained by eavesdropper during an individual attack .",
    "using inappropriate measure of information may lead to a wrong opinion about an essential weakness of conclusive eavesdropping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we discuss entropies and related information - theoretic terms . considered properties are of great importance in interpretation of measures of mutual information .",
    "so , the property to show a reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to knowledge of other is based on the chain rule for the conditional entropy . in section [ sec3 ] , we briefly describe two versions of the fuchs  peres ",
    "brandt ( fpb ) probe for eavesdropping the bb84 scheme .",
    "main findings of this paper are presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "using the two versions of the fpb probe , we compare their performance from the viewpoint of three measures of mutual information . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary of results .",
    "in this section , we review some material from information theory . quantum key distribution is a procedure used by alice and bob for obtaining two identical copies of a random and secret sequence of bits . making some intrusion into a communication channel ,",
    "eve try to learn original bits . during this process ,",
    "each of the three parties will obtain some string of bits .",
    "the three strings can be interpreted as binary random variables @xcite .",
    "a degree of dependence between two random variables is typically measured in terms of the mutual information .",
    "we begin with basic entropic functions .",
    "let discrete random variable @xmath0 take values on finite set with the probability distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the shannon entropy of @xmath0 is defined as @xcite @xmath2 as a rule , the range of summation will be clear from the context .",
    "the logarithm in ( [ shnent ] ) is taken to the base @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be another random variable , and let @xmath5 denote corresponding joint probabilities .",
    "the joint entropy @xmath6 is defined like ( [ shnent ] ) by substituting the joint probabilities .",
    "an adequacy of the quantity ( [ shnent ] ) in applications to quantum measurement statistics was discussed by brukner and zeilinger @xcite .",
    "further development of their approach to information is considered in @xcite .",
    "dealing with the notion of conditional entropy , we introduce the function @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "then the entropy of @xmath0 conditional on knowing @xmath4 is defined as @xcite @xmath9 the entropy is concave in probabilities , as the function @xmath10 is concave .",
    "it follows from concavity that @xcite @xmath11 in other words , conditioning on more reduces entropy .",
    "this property is essential for a treatment of ( [ cshen ] ) just as the conditional entropy .",
    "the definition ( [ cshen ] ) is further motivated by the chain rule @xcite @xmath12 it directly gives @xmath13 , whence we see remaining lack of knowledge about @xmath0 at the given @xmath4 .",
    "the notion of mutual information aims to measure how much information @xmath0 and @xmath4 have in common @xcite .",
    "the definition of mutual information is expressed as @xcite @xmath14 it is clearly symmetric in entries . by the chain rule ( [ schr ] ) , we can also rewrite ( [ mindf ] ) as @xmath15 so , the mutual information shows a reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to knowledge of other @xcite . in the context of quantum cryptography ,",
    "the mutual information was first applied in @xcite .",
    "such an approach was motivated with using some ideas of the paper @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will discuss some extensions of the above quantities to generalized entropic functions .",
    "note that such generalizations typically lose some of the essential properties used in information theory . the mutual information ( [ mindf ] ) is also used in definition of the shannon distinguishability @xcite .",
    "fuchs gave a comprehensive presentation of distinguishability measures in information theory , with a list of 528 references on related topics @xcite .",
    "rnyi entropies form an important family of one - parametric extensions of the shannon entropy ( [ shnent ] ) . for @xmath16 , the rnyi entropy of order @xmath17",
    "is defined as @xcite @xmath18 rnyi considered ( [ renent ] ) in connection with formal postulates characterizing entropic functions @xcite .",
    "the entropy ( [ renent ] ) is a non - increasing function of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the entropy is maximized for the uniform distribution : if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 then ( [ renent ] ) becomes @xmath21 , or merely @xmath22 for @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24 , the rnyi entropy gives ( [ shnent ] ) .",
    "the joint @xmath17-entropy @xmath25 is defined in line with ( [ renent ] ) by substituting the joint probabilities .",
    "some special choices of @xmath17 are widely used in the literature .",
    "the limit @xmath26 leads to the max - entropy equal to logarithm of the number of non - zero probabilities . in the binary case ,",
    "non - trivial max - entropies are all equal to @xmath27 . taking the limit @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the min - entropy @xmath29 .",
    "the case @xmath30 gives the so - called collision entropy , which will play an important role in our discussion : @xmath31 the question of concavity should be emphasized separately . for @xmath32 $ ] , the rnyi entropy is concave irrespectively to the actual dimensionality @xcite .",
    "convexity properties of @xmath33 with orders @xmath34 depend on dimensionality of probabilistic vectors @xcite .",
    "for instance , the binary rnyi entropy is concave for @xmath35 $ ] @xcite .    to extend the notion of mutual information to the rnyi case",
    ", we should define the corresponding conditional form .",
    "there is no generally accepted definition of conditional rnyi s entropy @xcite .",
    "similarly to ( [ pshen ] ) , for @xmath16 we introduce the function @xmath36 for @xmath37 , we mean here logarithm of the number of non - zero conditional probabilities .",
    "the conditional @xmath17-entropy is then defined by @xcite @xmath38 the limit @xmath24 gives the standard conditional entropy ( [ cshen ] ) .",
    "further , the case @xmath39 leads to the conditional min - entropy . for the given @xmath40",
    ", we define @xmath41 so that @xmath42 for all possible @xmath20 at the fixed @xmath40 .",
    "the formula ( [ rect2 ] ) then reads @xmath43 substituting ( [ ryin ] ) into the right - hand side of ( [ rect1 ] ) , we get the conditional min - entropy @xmath44 . similarly to ( [ renent ] ) , the quantity ( [ rect2 ] ) is a non - increasing function of @xmath17 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "we now ask for a behavior of ( [ rect1 ] ) under conditioning on more . as a corollary of the concavity , for @xmath32",
    "$ ] we have @xcite @xmath47 the question is more difficult for @xmath34 . as mentioned in section 2.3 of @xcite , the rnyi entropy is not concave for @xmath48 , where @xmath49 depends on the number @xmath50 of possible outcomes . in the binary case , we can apply ( [ rcoonm ] ) for all positive orders up to @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , no sufficiently exact estimations of the quantity @xmath51 are known . for more than two outcomes , we can not use ( [ rcoonm ] ) for @xmath30 and for larger values .",
    "entropic functions of the rnyi type do not share some properties satisfied by the standard entropic functions .",
    "in particular , the conditional form ( [ rect1 ] ) of order @xmath52 does not generally obey the chain rule .",
    "a comparison of proposed forms of conditional rnyi s entropy is given in @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to a discussion of the so - called `` rnyi mutual information '' . by an analogy with the formula ( [ dfmin ] ) , one introduces the quantity @xmath53 it could be interpreted as rnyi s version of mutual information . with @xmath30 , this quantity",
    "is widely used in studying a performance of probes in individual attacks on quantum cryptographic systems @xcite .",
    "security against collective attacks is typically studied with using the holevo information @xcite . despite of analogy between ( [ dfmin ] ) and ( [ rmidf ] ) ,",
    "the latter with @xmath52 is different in some essential respects .",
    "first , the quantity ( [ rmidf ] ) is not generally symmetric in its entries .",
    "second , the parameter @xmath17 runs a continuum of values , so that a proper choice of its value is not _ a priori _ clear . in a certain sense , advantages of an approach with generalized entropic functions is rather associated with a possibility to vary the used parameter @xcite .",
    "third , the conditional @xmath17-entropy ( [ rect1 ] ) does not share the chain rule .",
    "hence , we may fail with interpreting ( [ rmidf ] ) as a reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to knowledge of other .",
    "the above facts advise that we be very careful in treatment of the quantity ( [ rmidf ] ) , especially when only one value @xmath52 is involved .",
    "we will further use generally accepted term `` rnyi s mutual information '' .",
    "due to the above reasons , however , this quantity is not a completely legitimate measure of mutual information . for @xmath34 , we can rather interpret it as a family of upper bounds on the standard mutual information . in the considered model of key distribution ,",
    "the bits are completely random and the scheme works symmetrically with respect to the values `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' .",
    "this results in the fact that an entropy of each binary variable _ per se _ reaches its maximum @xmath27 irrespectively to @xmath17 .",
    "let random variable @xmath0 with @xmath50 possible outcomes be distributed uniformly , i.e. , @xmath54 independently of @xmath17 . for @xmath55 , we then have @xmath56 it follows from @xmath57 for @xmath55 , as the rnyi entropy of @xmath0 is constant .",
    "rnyi s mutual information of order @xmath34 gives an upper bound on the standard mutual information @xmath58 .",
    "properties of the above information measures will be essential in studies of their adequacy .",
    "the two versions of the fpb probe form a very spectacular example for considering this question .",
    "in this section , we recall basic details of the bb84 protocol , which is most analyzed and most often implemented @xcite . in this paper , we do not consider the problem of optimization of probe characteristics .",
    "rather , we wish to compare several possible measures to estimate a performance of given probes .",
    "two different approaches can be used on eve s side during an attack on the bb84 protocol of quantum key distribution . in any case , the eavesdropper is asked by distinguishing a quantum state from several known alternatives .",
    "the two basic schemes of distinguishing non - identical pure states are referred to as the minimum error discrimination and the unambiguous discrimination .",
    "the problem of optimization of entangling probe for an individual attack was considered by fuchs and peres @xcite .",
    "they showed numerically that the optimal detection method for a two - level system can be obtained with a two - dimensional probe only .",
    "the authors of @xcite have made detailed analysis for the bb84 scheme @xcite . in the paper @xcite",
    ", brandt showed that the obtained probe for attacking the bb84 scheme can be realized with a single cnot gate .",
    "following @xcite , this probe will be referred to as the fuchs  peres  brandt ( fpb ) probe .",
    "the analysis of @xcite is related to the case with the error - discard as reconciliation procedure .",
    "when alice and bob use other reconciliation methods , the probe considered is not optimal @xcite .",
    "let alice and bob use the two polarization bases @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "with respect to the horizontal polarization , the kets @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the diagonal basis relate to the angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . in each bit interval alice",
    "sends a single photon prepared accordingly .",
    "eve uses this photon as the control qubit input to a cnot gate .",
    "computational basis of this gate is defined in terms of the polarization states as @xmath65 eve prepares her own probe photon in the initial state @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the introduced parameter @xmath70 $ ] turns out to be the error probability @xcite .",
    "the state ( [ tcs ] ) is input as the target qubit into eve s cnot gate controlled by sent alice s qubit .    to find probabilities of outcomes ,",
    "the output of the gate should be expressed as a superposition , in which the first qubit is represented in a proper basis .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce sub - normalized vectors @xmath71 when alice uses the basis @xmath59 , eve s cnot gate acts as @xmath72 in a similar manner , for the basis @xmath60 we obtain @xmath73 suppose that bob applies the basis that alice has employed and his outcome matches what alice sent .",
    "this case focuses on the error - free sifted bits shared by alice and bob . to learn their shared bit value",
    ", eve should distinguish between the sub - normalized outputs @xmath74 and @xmath75 of the target qubit . at this stage",
    ", she could apply two different approaches mentioned above .    in the helstrom scheme of distinguishing between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the average error probability",
    "is minimized @xcite . in the case",
    "considered , this measurement is described by projectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for any of the states",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 , the false - alarm probability is equal to @xmath78 the second approach is known as the unambiguous discrimination @xcite .",
    "it sometimes gives an inconclusive answer , but never makes an error of mis - identification .",
    "let us define two sub - normalized states @xmath79 so that @xmath80 . the povm elements of unambiguous discrimination",
    "are then written as @xcite @xmath81 the probability of inconclusive answer is equal to the overlap of the states to be discriminated @xcite . calculating the overlap with the normalized vectors , we get @xmath82 we shall now obtain values of any mutual information as a function of @xmath83 .    to analyze a probe performance ,",
    "calculations will be conditioned on the error - free sifted bits shared by alice and bob @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the case , when eve uses the helstrom scheme . by the prime sign ,",
    "we will mean terms related to the error - free sifted bits .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath84 .",
    "the formula ( [ hser ] ) merely gives the conditional probabilities @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "as alice s bits are equally likely to be @xmath87 and @xmath22 , two possible values of @xmath88 are equally likely as well . multiplying ( [ hser ] ) by @xmath89 , we then obtain the joint probabilities @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the joint probabilities for the case @xmath92 read @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "it is also clear that here we have the symmetry @xmath95 . with these facts",
    ", we easily obtain any quantity representing an amount of mutual information .",
    "the standard mutual information is written as @xmath96 the rnyi mutual information of order @xmath30 becomes @xcite @xmath97 it is typically used for estimating a performance of quantum cryptographic probes @xcite . at the same time , there are no fundamental reasons to prefer just the order @xmath30 .",
    "advantages of a consideration with generalized entropies are rather connected with variations of entropic parameters .",
    "we will also include the case @xmath39 due to ( [ mofor2 ] ) .",
    "for the first version of the fpb probe , we have @xmath98 this value shows the least point of the interval , in which the mutual @xmath17-information ranges for the given @xmath83 . comparing the three quantities ( [ fpsm ] ) , ( [ fprm2 ] ) , and ( [ fprm8 ] ) with the case of conclusive probe will show deficiencies of using ( [ rmidf ] ) as a measure of eve s information gain .",
    "the quantities ( [ fpsm ] ) , ( [ fprm2 ] ) , and ( [ fprm8 ] ) are symmetric with respect to the entries @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it is not the case for the probe with unambiguous discrimination .    in the conclusive modification ,",
    "eve discriminates between @xmath74 and @xmath75 unambiguously .",
    "this case is more complicated as involving an inconclusive answer .",
    "restricted to the error - free sifted bits of alice and bob , the probabilities of outcomes are @xmath101 we further have @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath94 @xcite . for the conclusive probe ,",
    "the standard mutual information is equal to @xmath104 for all @xmath46 , the rnyi mutual @xmath17-information is also given by the right - hand side of ( [ fpbsm ] ) .",
    "that is , it does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "this property reflects that the situation is completely deterministic whenever @xmath105 too .",
    "hence , for all @xmath46 we have @xmath106 for @xmath107 , two possible values of @xmath99 are equiprobable , so that @xmath108 . for all @xmath46 , therefore , the conditional entropy reads @xmath109 bob s bits are equally likely to be @xmath87 and @xmath22 , whence @xmath110 . combining the latter with ( [ rafix ] )",
    ", we actually get @xmath111 thus , the rnyi mutual information increases with @xmath17 for the usual probe and is constant for the conclusive probe .",
    "the above results will be used in analysis of an adequacy of rnyi s mutual information in the context of quantum cryptography .",
    "in this section , we consider quantities of the form ( [ rmidf ] ) as estimators of a performance of quantum cryptographic probes . in particular , we will focus on the rnyi mutual information of order @xmath30 .",
    "the author of @xcite examined the conclusive version of the fpb probe just on the ground of this measure . on the other hand",
    ", there is no fundamental reasons to prefer namely the order @xmath30 .",
    "such choice of entropic parameter was rather used in @xcite for simplifying analytical calculations .",
    "indeed , explicit formulas of optimization problem seem to be most tractable for @xmath30 too . however , some convenience of calculations hardly is a proper motivation to choose the basic figure of a probe performance .",
    "the standard mutual information ( [ mindf ] ) obey many nice properties that justify its usual interpretation .",
    "such properties are connected with characteristics of the conditional entropy ( [ cshen ] ) .",
    "the definition ( [ rect1 ] ) of conditional rnyi s entropy is losing many of desired properties .",
    "in particular , it does not share the usual chain rule . only for two outcomes",
    "we can be sure that conditioning reduces the entropy with orders up to @xmath3 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the rnyi entropy is neither purely concave nor purely convex .",
    "the answer crucially depends on the number of possible outcomes @xcite . in general , the rnyi mutual information is not symmetric in its entries . for the conclusive modification of the fpb probe ,",
    "we generally have @xmath112 the left - hand side of ( [ nonsym ] ) is always given by ( [ fpbrm ] ) , whereas the right - hand side of ( [ nonsym ] ) essentially depends on @xmath17 .",
    "note that for the usual fpb probe we actually have the symmetry @xmath113 .",
    "this result follows from the fact @xmath114 already mentioned for the probe with helstrom s scheme of discrimination . in general , however , such symmetry is not valid .",
    "the above reasons show difficulties with the quantity ( [ rmidf ] ) . at the same time , these reasons are rather general in character . to give a complete picture",
    ", we must mention one fact proved by the authors of @xcite . for the original formulation of the b92 scheme",
    ", they proved that the standard mutual information and rnyi s information of order @xmath3 are maximized by the same optimal probe .",
    "it may be not valid for sophisticated protocols or scenarios . moreover",
    ", this property _ per se _ does not justify that rnyi s mutual information of order @xmath3 is always able to replace the standard one .",
    "we shall now exemplify some inadequacy of ( [ rmidf ] ) in the context of quantum cryptography .",
    "this conclusion is easily demonstrated by comparing the two versions of the fpb probe from the viewpoint of measures of the form ( [ rmidf ] ) with several @xmath17 .",
    "apparently , it is better represented by a contrast between the curves , which show various measures as functions of @xmath83 . as usual , we will focus on the interval @xmath84 .    on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the four curves are plotted . for the fpb probe with helstrom s scheme ,",
    "one shows ( [ fpsm ] ) by solid line , ( [ fprm2 ] ) by dash - dotted line , and ( [ fprm8 ] ) by dotted line . for the conclusive fpb probe ,",
    "we show all the measures of mutual information by dashed line . including the quantity ( [ fprm8 ] ) with @xmath39 allows to describe an interval , in which the rnyi mutual information may range with changing @xmath17 . in the paper @xcite , the two probes were compared on the base of rnyi s mutual information of order @xmath3 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a difference between dash - dotted and dashed lines is sufficiently large and reaches the maximum about @xmath115 . on this ground",
    ", a performance of the conclusive probe seems to be weak too , even for small values of @xmath83 .",
    "however , this difference can be changed by varying @xmath17 , since the quantity ( [ fpbrm ] ) is independent of @xmath17 due to a specific character of the conclusive probe .",
    "if we choose @xmath39 , then a difference is even more essential and reaches the maximum about @xmath116 .    ) by _ solid line _ , ( [ fprm2 ] ) by _ dash - dotted line _ , and ( [ fprm8 ] ) by _ dotted line_. for the conclusive probe , it shows ( [ fpbrm ] ) by _ dashed line_. ]    however , our conclusions on security of cryptographic schemes should be independent of a sporadic choice . keeping in mind the result ( [ mofor2 ] )",
    ", we conclude that rnyi s information of order @xmath34 should rather be treated as an upper bound on the mutual information .",
    "it is clearly demonstrated by the solid , dotted and dash - dotted lines for the fpb probe .",
    "the standard measure ( [ mindf ] ) of mutual information obeys many properties including the relation ( [ dfmin ] ) .",
    "it is for this reason that it is to be treated as a reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to knowledge of other . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no known analog of the result ( [ dfmin ] ) with measures of the rnyi type .",
    "moreover , we have arrived at the fact ( [ nonsym ] ) . to make a valid decision on eve s mutual information",
    ", the standard mutual information is most appropriate .",
    "this conclusion is brightly illustrated by the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . comparing the solid and dashed lines shows that the conclusive probe is certainly not so weak , as it could be imagined with the dash - dotted line . despite of some non - optimality ,",
    "the conclusive probe may nevertheless be of interest due to additional reasons .",
    "it is instructive to look at the situation in slightly other perspective . as bob s binary variable",
    "is uniformly distributed , we have @xmath110 irrespectively to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the maximization of eve s mutual information is equivalent to the minimization of the corresponding conditional entropy . in this regard , we see a similarity with one scenario of entropic uncertainty relations for successive measurement @xcite .",
    "we already mentioned that the definition ( [ rect1 ] ) loses some properties that are natural for a measure of conditional entropy .",
    "since the term @xmath117 does not increase with @xmath17 , for @xmath34 it gives a lower bound on the conditional entropy @xmath118 .",
    "this point is a counterpart of the fact that rnyi s mutual information of order @xmath34 leads to an upper bound on the standard one .    using the measures ( [ fprm2 ] ) or ( [ fprm8 ] ) , the legitimate users tend to be sure in an essential weakness of the conclusive version in comparison with the usual fpb probe .",
    "so , they could underestimate the degree of vulnerability with respect to conclusive eavesdropping . on the other hand ,",
    "an overstated estimation of probe power can lead to a wrong situation with practical realization of a communication system . as was remarked in section vi.l of @xcite",
    ", the infinite security implies the infinite cost . developing this observation",
    ", we may arrive at a conclusion .",
    "characteristics of a real cryptographic system are actually determined by the taken compromise between several conflicting requirements such as an amount of provided security versus paid costs or technological tools . in this regard",
    ", we wish to estimate precisely a performance of possible probes .    as curves of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show , using rnyi s mutual information may create an illusory `` power '' in amount of eve s mutual information .",
    "a degree of this illusion depends on the choice of @xmath34 .",
    "such a wrong expression about too strong probe performance may lead to rejecting some feasible realizations .",
    "they could seemingly be evaluated as unexpectedly vulnerable , even though they are suitable in other respects . for small values of @xmath83 , the ratio of ( [ fprm2 ] ) to ( [ fpsm ] ) can approach @xmath3 arbitrarily close .",
    "hence , a quality of the usual fpb probe in comparison with the conclusive one may be illusory up to two times .",
    "the mentioned difference is most essential for `` weak '' eavesdropping , when eve attempts to get a small amount of information while causing only a slight disturbance .",
    "nevertheless , this example illustrates a conclusion that security requirement could be overstated spuriously on the base of inappropriate measures of mutual information .    in principle , we may try to adopt the right - hand side of ( [ nonsym ] ) , which is the @xmath17-entropy of eve s bits minus the @xmath17-entropy conditioned on bob s bits .",
    "our example shows , however , that such measures of mutual information are completely inappropriate . for the conclusive version ,",
    "we obtain the conditional entropies @xmath119 where @xmath94 .",
    "to illustrate an inadequacy of @xmath120 for @xmath52 , we calculate it for the least order @xmath39 .",
    "using ( [ peps ] ) and ( [ cpeb ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath121 that is , this quantity sharply increases from @xmath87 to @xmath22 in a narrow interval of @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath30 , we also get the quantity @xmath122 the latter presents slightly smoothed variant of ( [ irinf ] ) and also has a narrow interval of sharp increasing .",
    "this behavior quite differs from ( [ fpbsm ] ) .",
    "thus , the measures ( [ irinf ] ) and ( [ iren2 ] ) hardly represent anything with respect to the conclusive probe .    in the context of quantum cryptography ,",
    "unambiguous state discrimination is also interesting in another respect .",
    "the rate of inconclusive tests is actually an additional check parameter .",
    "this fact was actually noticed in @xcite with respect to the b92 scheme with conclusive receiver .",
    "for some of individual entangling - probe attacks against this setup , eve s activity affects a rate of inconclusive outcomes .",
    "as was mentioned in @xcite , unchanged rate of inconclusive results can not be treated as a security confirmation . on the other hand , unexpected variations of this rate",
    "are probably a witness of opposite activity .",
    "the same fact seems to be valid with respect to eve s party . observing surprise changes in inconclusive tests",
    ", eve will rather decide that her opponents have made counter measures . of course",
    ", any party may influence on a rate of inconclusive outcomes by means of the so - called fake states .",
    "however , such an approach will demand additional costs and more complicated equipment . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the use of unambiguous discrimination is certainly of practical interest .",
    "the following question is also related to conclusive eavesdropping . as was discussed in section 4 of @xcite , conclusive eavesdropping is especially interesting when there is loss between alice s transmitter and bob s receiver . here",
    ", eve can act as follows .",
    "she captures each carrier from alice and recognizes it using the unambiguous state discrimination .",
    "then she prepares qubit for transmission to bob , whenever the test has given the conclusive answer .",
    "when the probability of conclusive result is higher than the transmissivity of the communication channel , the quantum cryptography seems to be inappropriately vulnerable . in the terminology of the paper @xcite , this strategy corresponds to opaque eavesdropping .",
    "it seems that opaque eavesdropping on the bb84 scheme has received less attention than it deserves . in any case",
    ", studies of such a kind should use properly chosen quantifier of mutual information .",
    "using the two versions of eavesdropping with the fpb probe , we compared different quantifiers of an amount of eve s mutual information about the error - free sifted bits .",
    "the so - called rnyi mutual information , usually used with order @xmath3 , is not a completely legitimate measure of the mutual information . for @xmath34",
    ", it should rather be interpreted as an upper bound on the standard mutual information .",
    "the standard mutual information must be considered as a preferable measure , at least in studies of conclusive eavesdropping .",
    "these conclusions were expected from a consideration of properties of related information - theoretic quantities .",
    "further , we explicitly demonstrate our findings by comparison of the conclusive modification with the usual one .",
    "the use of inappropriate measures of mutual information could lead to wrong decisions in practical building a communication with quantum key distribution .",
    "finally , we shall briefly discuss possible alternatives to using information functions of the rnyi type .",
    "tsallis entropies @xcite form another especially important family of generalized entropies .",
    "two conditional forms of the tsallis entropy were considered @xcite .",
    "first of them obeys the chain rule of usual form , whence tsallis counterpart of the mutual information is arisen @xcite . in principle , such measures of information could be applied in the context of eavesdropping .",
    "another way is to use information metrics of this type .",
    "the standard conditional entropy leads to an information metric between random variables @xcite .",
    "each of two conditional forms of tsallis entropy also provides a legitimate metric @xcite , though the second one does not share the chain rule . in section [ sec4 ] , we already noticed that maximizing mutual information reached with the fpb probe can be rewritten as minimizing the corresponding conditional entropy .",
    "so , it is of interest to study a probe performance from the viewpoint of information metrics .",
