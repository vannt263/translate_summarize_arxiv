    "this paper concerns the mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of nonlinear waves in the _ newton s cradle _ , a classical mechanical system consisting of a chain of beads suspended from a bar by inelastic strings ( see figure [ boules ] ) .",
    "all beads are identical and behave like a linear pendula in the absence of contact with nearest neighbours , but mechanical constraints between touching beads introduce geometric nonlinearities .    in the last decades ,",
    "this system has been considered as a reference problem to test multiple impacts laws , aimed at evaluating e.g. the post - impact velocities of all beads after a bead is released at one end of the cradle @xcite ( see also @xcite for additional references ) .",
    "this problem is very delicate , because the collisional dynamics involves nonlinear elastic waves that propagate along the granular chain .",
    "one of the important factors that influence wave propagation and multiple collisions is the nature of elastic interactions between beads ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hertz s theory @xcite allows to compute the repulsive force between two identical and initially tangent spherical beads that are compressed and slightly flatten .",
    "when the distance between their centers decreases by @xmath2 ( see figure [ boules ] ) , the repulsive force @xmath3 is @xmath4 at leading order in @xmath5 , where @xmath6 depends on the ball radius and material properties and @xmath7 .",
    "this result remains valid for much more general geometries @xcite , but @xmath8 can be larger for irregular contacts ( @xmath9 in the presence of conical asperities @xcite ) or smaller for surfaces that squeeze more easily ( @xmath10 for solid cylinders in contact at two ends ) .",
    "hertz s type contact forces have several properties that make the analysis of wave propagation particularly difficult .",
    "firstly , they consist of unilateral constraints i.e. no force is present when beads are not in contact .",
    "moreover , they are fully nonlinear for @xmath11 , and in that case classical linear wave theory becomes useless .",
    "in addition @xmath12 is not defined for @xmath13 , therefore the use of perturbative methods is more delicate . developping analytical tools to overcome these obstacles",
    "is important , because the latter are at the heart of wave propagation in granular media .",

    "right  : schematic representation of two compressed beads.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a simplified model for newton s cradle reads in dimensionless form @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the horizontal displacement of the @xmath16th bead from the ground - state , i.e. the equilibrium position at which each pendulum is vertical , beads are in contact at a single point and uncompressed .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath17 takes the following form as @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the heaviside function vanishing on @xmath21 and equal to unity on @xmath22 , @xmath23  is the usual landau s symbol and @xmath11 a fixed constant .",
    "the potential @xmath24 corresponds to a generalized hertz contact force and @xmath25 incorporates higher - order corrections . system ( [ vhertz ] ) is hamiltonian with total energy @xmath26 equation ( [ nc ] ) considered on the infinite lattice @xmath27 applies in principle to large ensembles of beads ( so that boundary effects can be neglected for waves propagating in their core ) , but this model is also suitable to describe strongly localized standing waves in relatively small systems .    the simplest model to encompass difficulties inherent to hertz s contact nonlinearities consists of a chain of identical spherical beads without local oscillators , in contact with their neighbours at a single point when the chain is at rest .",
    "intensive research has been carried out on the analytical description of compression pulses in this system .",
    "nesterenko analyzed the problem using a formal continuum limit @xcite , and found an approximate pulse solution consisting of a compression solitary wave with compact support ( see also @xcite for a slightly different continuum limit , and @xcite for an extension to dimer chains ) .",
    "in addition , chatterjee @xcite has subsequently obtained an improved approximation revealing a double - exponential decay of the wave profile . as shown by mackay @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , exact solitary waves exist since a theorem of friesecke and wattis @xcite proving their existence readily applies to the chain of beads with hertz contact forces .",
    "in addition , english and pego @xcite have shown that these solitary waves have a doubly - exponential decay in the case of hertz s force .",
    "more details on the dynamics of these solitary waves can be found in the review @xcite .",
    "in addition , much more properties of solitary waves are known when an external load @xmath28 is applied at both ends of the chain and all beads undergo a small compression @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics around this new equilibrium state reduces to the one of the classical fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattice @xcite , in the case of which solitary waves with exponential decay @xcite and two - soliton solutions @xcite are known to exist , small amplitude solitary waves are well described by the kdv equation @xcite and are stable @xcite .",
    "this mapping between the chain of compressed beads and the fpu model is interesting , because the latter is known to display a rich dynamical behaviour and sustain many other kinds of nonlinear waves ( see @xcite for recent reviews on this topic ) . among the most fundamental excitations existing in fpu chains , periodic travelling waves @xcite are particularly important to understand energy propagation and dispersive shocks @xcite .",
    "however , no solutions of this type are known for the the chain of beads in the absence of external load .",
    "the above mentioned periodic travelling waves are degenerate when @xmath30 , because the sound velocity ( i.e. the maximal velocity of linear waves ) vanishes as @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason the uncompressed chain of beads is commonly denoted as a  sonic vacuum \" @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the above statement , we prove in this paper that nonlinear periodic travelling waves exist in newton s cradle , due to the interplay between the on - site oscillators and fully - nonlinear contact interactions among beads .",
    "[ existthm ] consider a potential @xmath32 taking the form ( [ vhertz ] ) with @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath18 .",

    "firstly , the family of periodic travelling waves ( parametrized by @xmath40 and @xmath55 ) is singular when @xmath56 ( which is the case for hertz s contact law ) , in the sense that the frequency @xmath57 defined by ( [ wleadingorder ] ) is not differentiable with respect to @xmath39 at @xmath58 .",
    "this originates from the limited smoothness of the potential @xmath24 at the origin ( @xmath59 is not defined ) .",
    "moreover , as a result of fully nonlinear interactions between beads , for all wavenumber @xmath40 the wave frequency @xmath60 converges towards unity in the small amplitude limit @xmath50 ( i.e. the linear phonon band reduces to a single frequency ) .",
    "the periodic travelling waves ( [ xleadingorder])-([wleadingorder ] ) carry an energy flux in the direction of wave propagation when @xmath61 . in the special case @xmath62 , solution ( [ xleadingorder ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath63 and corresponds to in - phase oscillations of uninteracting linear pendula . for @xmath64 these solutions",
    "correspond to binary oscillations @xmath65 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ existthm ] proceeds in two steps .",
    "firstly , we formally derive in section [ gdnls ] an amplitude equation @xmath66 which describes small amplitude approximate solutions of ( [ nc ] ) taking the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a small parameter and @xmath69 .",
    "the approximate solutions determined by ( [ dfnls])-([ansatz ] ) consist of slow modulations in time of solutions of problem ( [ nc ] ) linearized at @xmath70 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) and amplitude equation ( [ dfnls ] ) are consistent with the nonlinear problem ( [ nc ] ) , in the sense that ( [ ansatz ] ) approximately satisfies ( [ nc ] ) up to an @xmath71 error term .",
    "we show in section [ twsol ] that ( [ dfnls ] ) admits an explicit family of periodic travelling wave solutions , which provide the harmonic part of ( [ xleadingorder ] ) and the leading order terms of the dispersion relation ( [ wleadingorder ] ) . in a second step ,",
    "we prove in section [ fixedpoint ] the existence of exact periodic travelling wave solutions of ( [ nc ] ) close to these approximate solutions . for this purpose",
    "we consider an advance - delay differential equation that determines travelling waves of given period .",
    "we solve this problem by adapting the lyapunov - schmidt technique to the kind of nonlinearity with limited smoothness present in ( [ nc ] ) ( using the contraction mapping theorem instead of the implicit function theorem employed in the usual case ) .    our approach has the advantage of giving explicitly the principal part of travelling waves in the small amplitude limit , since expressions ( [ xleadingorder])-([va ] ) provide an approximation of the exact solutions up to an @xmath72 error term .",
    "in fact , we will show that far more complex approximations of order @xmath73 can be obtained for all @xmath74 , which constitutes an unexpected result given the limited smoothness of @xmath17 at the origin .    in section [ stable ]",
    "we complete theorem [ existthm ] by numerical results , in order to study the limits of the above analysis when one leaves the small amplitude regime .",
    "along the same line , it would be interesting to analyze periodic travelling wave solutions of ( [ nc ] ) using variational methods @xcite or degree theory @xcite , since this should relax the assumption of small amplitude waves ( with the limitation of describing travelling wave profiles and dispersion relations with less precision than perturbative methods ) .",
    "we call equation ( [ dfnls ] ) the time - dependent _ discrete @xmath0-schrdinger _ ( dps ) equation , because it can be seen as a finite - difference spatial discretization of the generalized schrdinger equation @xmath75 , where the usual laplacian operator is replaced by the one - dimensional @xmath0-laplacian @xmath76 and @xmath77 . its fully nonlinear structure and fractional power nonlinearities originate from the fully nonlinear interaction forces of ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the unilateral character of hertz s contact forces is averaged out along the fast oscillations of the pendula , which results in much simpler nonlinearities at the level of the dps equation . in the present context",
    ", the dps equation substitutes to the classical discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xmath78 which can be derived for hamiltonian lattices with smooth ( at least @xmath79 ) potential energies and linear dispersion @xcite",
    ".    equation ( [ dfnls ] ) tells in fact much more on the dynamics of newton s cradle than what is described in theorem [ existthm ] . in section",
    "[ unstable ] we numerically observe that certain periodic travelling waves of ( [ nc ] ) are unstable through the phenomenon of modulational instability .",
    "their envelope self - localizes under the effect of small perturbations , yielding spatially localized and time - periodic intermittent compressions of the beads .",
    "these localized oscillations propagate along the chain and sometimes remain pinned at some lattice sites .",
    "these waves correspond to _ discrete breathers _ , a class of nonlinear excitations ubiquitous in spatially discrete systems @xcite .",
    "they have been studied both experimentally and theoretically in different types of granular chains , in the absence of local oscillators and under precompression @xcite .",
    "we check numerically that the dps equation accurately describes the modulational instability of certain small amplitude periodic travelling waves , provided one avoids near - critical cases and higher - harmonic instabilities ( section [ unstable ] ) .",
    "moreover , numerical computations reveal that breather solutions of the dps equation ( determined as homoclinic orbits of a discrete map ) describe with high precision the envelope of small amplitude breathers of ( [ nc ] ) ( sections [ twsol ] and [ loc ] ) .",
    "the dps equation also qualitatively reproduces differents kinds of slow interactions of discrete breathers , namely the fissionning of a localized perturbation into slowly travelling breathers , and the merging of two breathers into a single one after a long transcient ( section [ loc ] ) .",
    "more generally , we numerically find a plethora of standing wave solutions of the dps equation given by the orbits of an area - preserving and reversible map ( sections [ twsol ] ) , which suggests the existence of many time - periodic standing wave solutions of ( [ nc ] ) with a huge variety of spatial behaviours .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ gdnlsgen ] contains the formal derivation of the dps equation and a short discussion of some travelling wave and standing wave solutions .",
    "the proof of theorem [ existthm ] is given in section [ fixedpoint ] and most numerical computations performed in section [ numeric ] .",
    "lastly , section [ conclu ] discusses new perspectives and open problems resulting from the present work .",
    "the aim of this section is twofold .",
    "section [ gdnls ] presents a formal derivation of the dps equation , starting from newton s cradle equations ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "one has to stress that this gives by no means a justification that the dps equation approximates the original system for appropriate initial conditions and timescales ( these problems will be studied analytically in section [ fptw ] for exact travelling waves , and numerically in section [ numeric ] for various initial conditions ) . in section [ twsol ] , we study particular classes of solutions of the dps equation , i.e. periodic travelling waves and standing waves .",
    "periodic travelling waves are computed explicitly , a result which will serve as a basis for the analytical and numerical studies of sections [ fixedpoint ] and [ numeric ] .",
    "standing waves are studied numerically for @xmath7 , with a special emphazis on spatially localized standing waves ( these solutions are important to describe modulational instabilities in system ( [ nc ] ) , as section [ numeric ] will show ) .      in this section",
    "we formally derive the dps equation ( [ dfnls ] ) from the original dynamical equations ( [ nc ] ) , using a multiscale expansion technique .",
    "we look for solutions of ( [ nc ] ) in the form of slow modulations in time of @xmath46-periodic functions ( @xmath46 being the period of the linear on - site oscillators ) .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath80 where @xmath81 corresponds to a slow time , @xmath82 is a small parameter , and @xmath83 for all @xmath84 . we replace ( [ nc ] ) by the infinite system of coupled pde @xmath85\\ ,   x_{n } =   v^\\prime(x_{n+1}-x_n)-v^\\prime(x_{n}-x_{n-1 } ) , \\ \\ \\",

    "<S> we show that the dps equation admits explicit periodic travelling wave solutions , and numerically find a plethora of standing wave solutions given by the orbits of a discrete map , in particular spatially localized breather solutions . using a modified lyapunov - schmidt technique , we prove the existence of exact periodic travelling waves in the chain of beads , close to the small amplitude modulated waves given by the dps equation . using numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dps equation captures several other important features of the dynamics in the weakly nonlinear regime , namely modulational instabilities , the existence of static and travelling breathers , and repulsive or attractive interactions of these localized structures .    </S>",
