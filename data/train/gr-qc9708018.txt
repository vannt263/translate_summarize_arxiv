    "the first and most radical departure of string theory from a theory of elementary point particles is in the nature of its elementary degrees of freedom .",

    "thus the area law dynamics automatically prescribes a free particle like role for the centre of mass mode and a simple harmonic oscillator like role for the wiggle modes @xmath76 with frequency @xmath77 .",

    "this defines the spectrum of the free closed string in @xmath0 .",
    "the wavefunction of this state in the basis of independent coordinate variables then follows from inspection of ( [ lagrangian ] ) : @xmath95},\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the @xmath97 hermite polynomial . on the oscillators coming from the fact that there is no preferred point in the @xmath10 direction along the string",
    "the form of @xmath98 is more complicated than the usual @xmath99 because the @xmath76 defined here do not represent the left and right moving modes respectively .",

    "these rules essentially specify string perturbation theory completely .",
    "the effective interactions of massless particles in the string spectrum ( gravitons , dilatons and antisymmetric tensor particles in the bosonic string and also photons or gauge particles in the heterotic string ) can be determined from these considerations ( see , e.g. , green , schwarz and witten 1987 ) .",

    "a typical experiment involves scattering a probe off the string . in order for the probe to ` see ' the @xmath131 mode it must interact with it and excite it from its ground state .",
    "this would cost energy @xmath132 from ( [ spectrum1 ] ) . a probe with a finite energy @xmath133",
    "would only excite a finite number of oscillator modes ; therefore the infinite sum in @xmath128 should be cutoff at a finite value of @xmath22 depending upon the energy of the probe . for @xmath134 , none of the oscillator modes will be excited and the string will effectively look like a point particle .",

    "it is interesting that both forms as well as intermediate ones can be derived by elementary considerations of string wavefunctions using different assumptions of how the energy is distributed among the oscillator modes of the target .",
    "one can ask , what determines the actual distribution of the probe kinetic energy among the various oscillator modes of the target ?",
    "this needs further investigation .",
    "the analysis of amati , ciafaloni and veneziano ( 1989 ) suggests that the scattering angle plays a role in determining it .    from the above it",
    "is evident that the smallest observable length of any object in a string universe ( where everything , objects and probes , is ultimately made of strings ) is of the order of @xmath113 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the new wiggle degrees of freedom of strings .",
    "0.3 cm * gravitational collapse , black holes , random walks * : in the above scattering experiment if too much energy is deposited in the higher @xmath22 modes of the target string , its size can become smaller than its schwarzchild radius and it can suffer gravitational collapse .",
    "for example , an interesting choice of energy distribution among the modes of the target is to assume that it is thermal .",
    "that is , assume that all oscillator states of the target having a total energy @xmath133 are equally likely .",

    "the entropy @xmath157 of this ` black hole ' , given by @xmath158 ( see next section ) would be @xmath159 , proportional to its ` area ' .",
    "the expectation value of the length of the string in the thermal state is @xmath160 , as for a classical string configuration ( or a cosmic string ) .",

    "it turns out that there is an infinite number of singularities to the left of @xmath216 ( djt 1989a ) whose locations in general depend upon the radius of universe . for universes much larger than @xmath101 ( and also , by duality , for universes much smaller than @xmath101 ) , a number of these singularities approach @xmath216 .",
    "second , since the spectrum exhibits duality , so do the partition function and density of states @xmath224 : [ zduality ] z(,r)=z ( , ) ( e , r)= ( e , ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that for every @xmath210 there exists an @xmath225 ( obtained from @xmath210 by interchanging the momentum and winding numbers of every string in the state @xmath210 ) such that @xmath226 .",

    "since @xmath228 and @xmath229 are related by a laplace transform , the leading large energy behaviour of @xmath230 is controlled by the behaviour of @xmath223 near its singularities , and can be determined by a contour deformation technique ( djt 1989a , 1991 ) . at large radius ( @xmath231 ) and at energy densities above the ` hagedorn energy density ' @xmath232 , the density of states is given by ( deo , jain , narayan , tan 1992 ( djnt ) ) [ density ] ( e , r ) _ 0  e^_0 e + a_0 v [ 1-(e , r ) ] , ( e , r)= ( _ 0 e)^2|d - 1 e^-(_0-_1)(e-_0 v ) .",

    "the entropy @xmath248 is given by [ entropy ] s(e , r ) _ 0 e + a_0 v + ( 1- ) , from which one finds the temperature @xmath249^{-1}$ ] to be [ temp ] t(e , r ) t_h(1-_0-_1 ) , and the pressure @xmath250 [ pressure ] p(e , r ) t_h a_0 ( 1- [ 1+_0_0 ( 2_0 + |d - 2 ) ] ) .    thus both the temperature and pressure of the string universe reach asymptotic values determined by the string length scale @xmath120 at energy densities above hagedorn ; corrections to these asymptotic values are exponentially suppressed above these energy densities .",
    "the physical reasons for this are as follows .",
    "the leading contribution to the density of states of a string gas grows as the exponential of a linear function of @xmath133 , unlike for a gas of point particles where it grows exponentially with a sublinear function .",
    "this is because the number of oscillator states at a fixed large value of @xmath251 , grows as @xmath252 .",
    "this is just the hardy - ramanujam asymptotic formula for the number of partitions of a large positive integer @xmath253 into non - negative integers , a result in number theory .",
    "thus , even for a single string the density of states grows exponentially @xmath254 with energy ( since @xmath255 from ( [ spectrum2 ] ) ) .",
    "by contrast the contribution to the density of states from the momentum and winding modes is very small .",
    "e.g. , for a single particle , for which only momentum modes contribute , the density of states grows only as a power @xmath256 .",
    "thus at large energies it is entropically favourable for the energy to go into oscillator modes rather than momentum or winding modes .",
    "a term in the entropy of the gas that is linear in energy gives rise to a constant , i.e. , energy independent temperature .",
    "the form of the subleading corrections ( which is due to an interplay between oscillator , momentum and winding modes ) tells us that @xmath218 is an upper limiting temperature .",
    "figure 1 displays the behaviour of temperature as a function of energy for an ideal gas of strings and contrasts it with an ideal gas of point particles .",
    "the reason for the asymptotic pressure is as follows : the leading term @xmath257 in the entropy does not contribute to the pressure because it is independent of the volume at constant energy ; this is because the oscillator mode contribution to the energy ( [ spectrum2 ] )  is volume independent .",
    "the second term , @xmath258 , should be interpreted as the contribution of momentum modes .",
    "it is proportional to volume just like for a gas of point particles , due to the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "( a pure winding mode gas by contrast will give a contribution proportional to @xmath259 , which is subleading for large radii . )    for an ordinary point particle gas the entropy also depends upon the energy density @xmath260v$ ] , from which the usual expression @xmath261 with @xmath262 follows .",
    "in the string case above , the coefficient of @xmath263 is just a constant , @xmath237 .",
    "the physical reason is that above hagedorn energy density , the energy density in momentum modes is a constant independent of the total energy density .",
    "if more energy is pumped into the box , it goes primarily into oscillator modes , which are entropically favoured , than into momentum modes .",
    "conversely , if some energy is taken out of the box ( keeping the total density still above hagedorn ) , it is primarily extracted from the oscillator modes keeping the energy in the momentum modes essentially the same .",
    "equivalently , if one expands the volume slightly keeping energy the same ( this is what is implied by the derivative @xmath264 ) , energy flows from the oscillators to the momentum modes to keep the energy density in the latter constant . thus the energy density in momentum modes ( which are the contributors to pressure , consisting of small strings bouncing around like particles )",
    "is independent of the volume or the total energy density ( as long as the latter is above hagedorn ) and hence is the pressure .",
    "the above argument seems to be consistent with our present picture of how the total energy of the gas is distributed among various strings . in the energy and radius domain under discussion ,",
    "the string gas can be considered to be consisting of broadly speaking two ` components ' , of energies @xmath265 and @xmath266 with @xmath267 .",
    "the first component consists of a few ( @xmath268 $ ] ) large strings which capture most of the energy of the gas ( @xmath269 provided @xmath270 ) . `",
    "large ' strings are those whose energies are @xmath271 or greater .",
    "most of their energy is due to oscillator modes and the wavefunctions of these strings spread across the whole universe ( recall from the previous section that the size of a thermal string of energy @xmath213 is @xmath272 , hence spread is @xmath273 for @xmath274 ) .",
    "if one adopts a classical picture , the universe is stuffed with space filling brownian walks ( see salomonson and skagerstam 1986 ; mitchell and turok 1987 ) .",
    "the second component has fixed total energy @xmath275 and consists of many ( @xmath276 ) small strings ` small ' ranges in size from @xmath277 to @xmath278 , and in energy from zero to @xmath279 ) .",
    "a crucial property of the gas is that as more energy is pumped into the box , it goes into the first component , leaving @xmath266 fixed .",
    "this was qualitatively anticipated by frautschi ( 1971 ) , carlitz ( 1972 ) , mitchell and turok ( 1987 ) , aharanov , englert and orloff ( 1987 ) , and bowick and giddings ( 1989 ) , and made quantitatively explicit in djt ( 1989b , 1991 ) and djnt . this picture is unaltered by the introduction of conservation laws for the total winding number and momentum , even though additional subleading terms arise in the density of states .",
    "0.3 cm * duality ; thermodynamics in small spaces * : we have so far discussed the case of large @xmath133 and large radius @xmath280 . what happens at very small radii ?",
    "this is immediately answered by duality . at @xmath281 , the r.h.s . of ( [ density ] )  has the same form but with @xmath263 replaced by @xmath282 ( now @xmath283 ) .",
    "the same is therefore true of temperature and pressure ( we now define @xmath284 ) . at @xmath285",
    "we find that the leading behaviour of the density of states is still given by ( [ density ] ) , but now @xmath263 is replaced by a slowly varying function of @xmath163 of order @xmath286 , and @xmath287 ( djt 1989a , djnt ) .",
    "the temperature as a function of @xmath133 is still given by ( [ temp])with these replacements .",
    "however the pressure needs to be appropriately defined and interpreted in this domain ( since @xmath288 has to have an extremum at the duality radius , both definitions @xmath250 and @xmath284 imply that @xmath79 passes through a zero at @xmath289 ) .",
    "0.3 cm * inconsistency of string thermodynamics in non - compact spaces * : finally we remark that string thermodynamics seems to be internally consistent only in a compact space .",
    "the reason is that in a noncompact space to define the density of states we have to consider an artificial box of large volume @xmath263 to confine the gas and later take the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is problematic in string theory because strings are extended objects , they can in principle extend from one wall to another , and render the entropy inextensive .",
    "one can see the problem explicitly at high energy densities @xmath290 when there exist a few strings in the gas whose individual energy is a significant fraction of the total energy @xmath133 .",
    "the spread of their wavefunction is therefore @xmath291 .",
    "let the number of large dimensions ( of radius @xmath292 ) be @xmath234 . then since @xmath293",
    ", these strings have a size @xmath294 .",
    "thus for @xmath242 these strings have a spread much greater than @xmath163 , the size of the universe itself . in a compact universe",
    "this is not a problem ; the string can wrap around the universe many times .",
    "but if the universe were to be noncompact in these @xmath234 directions , then we find that these strings hit the walls of the artificial box with nowhere to expand , leading to an inconsistency of interpretation ( see also djnt ) .",
    "* absence of a temperature singularity * : we now discuss how the above considerations might impinge on cosmology . let us follow our present universe ( assumed compact in all dimensions but with three large dimensions ) backwards in time according to the standard model of cosmology . at the epoch where the energy density in the large dimensions is above @xmath295 but the radius is still much greater than @xmath113 ( this is quite natural in the standard model at early epochs ) , let us assume that the standard model physics is replaced by string theory , and use the ideal gas approximation ( [ density ] ) .",
    "then as we proceed to smaller radii and hence higher energy densities , the temperature and pressure being governed by equations ( [ temp ] )  and ( [ pressure ] ) no longer increase indefinitely ( as they would in any point particle theory ) but flatten out .",

    "falls_. this is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the behaviour of temperature as a function of radius ( at fixed energy or fixed entropy ) is symmetric about @xmath299 . at very small radius",
    "it does not diverge as it does for a universe made of elementary point particles , but behaves just as for a very large universe .",
    "the string universe has no temperature singularity",
    ".    0.3 cm * physical interpretation of a small universe * : what is the physics of this bizarre behaviour ?",
    "this was discussed by brandenberger and vafa ( 1989 ) , even before the precise expression ( [ density ] ) for the density of states was known .",
    "they asked the question : how would one measure the size of the universe if it were very small ? for a large periodic box one can imagine sending a light signal ( a localized photon wave - packet ) and measuring the time it takes to come back .",
    "but this experiment would fail in very small box .",
    "the energy of a momentum mode goes as @xmath300 , and a superposition of many such modes is needed to create a localized wave - packet , thereby making it more and more energetically difficult to send a wave - packet in smaller universe . in string theory",
    "the photon is a massless state with some momentum quantum number @xmath301 , winding number zero , and a single oscillator excitation ( the term @xmath302 $ ] in ( [ spectrum2 ] ) , or its analogue for heterotic strings , is zero ) . in today",
    "s universe ( assumed large ) these are easily excited , but it would be energetically very difficult to create photons and send them around in a universe of size @xmath281 ( see ( [ spectrum2 ] ) ) . on the other hand , in a very small universe , particles ` dual ' to the photon , with quantum numbers @xmath303 , some winding number * w * , and the same oscillator quantum numbers as the photon would be easily excited . indeed these would constitute the ` light ' particles of the very small universe .",
    "an observer in this very small universe would hardly think of sending photons to measure the size of his universe ( just as we would not contemplate sending winding modes around ) ; he would use a superposition of the ` dual photon ' modes . by sending such modes he would be measuring the extent of the ` dual position coordinate ' @xmath304 ( recall that @xmath304 is to winding modes",
    "what position @xmath164 is to momentum modes ) .",
    "but , as discussed earlier , that extent is just @xmath305 ; hence observers in a universe of size @xmath281 would find its radius to be not @xmath163 but @xmath306 .    indeed in a universe with @xmath281 all momentum modes would be energetically difficult to excite .",
    "everything - signals , apparatus , observer - would be made from particles that have zero * m * quantum number ( in our present large universe everything is made of zero * w * quantum number ) . since string theory has duality as a symmetry of the spectrum as well as the interactions",
    ", the dual particles would interact with each other exactly the way normal particles do in our present universe .",
    "the observers in a very small universe would not therefore know that they are in a universe much smaller than @xmath101 , their physics would be identical to ours ( and for that matter nor do we know whether our universe is very large or very small compared to @xmath113 ) .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that temperature has the behaviour shown in figure 2 . as radius goes much smaller than @xmath101 , the universe actually _ expands , as seen by the modes that are excited in it_. this also makes it evident that there are no physical singularities in the energy density , pressure or curvature as @xmath307 . in a very small universe ,",
    "the physical energy density is not @xmath308 but @xmath309 ( which goes to zero and not infinity as @xmath307 ) , since the physical volume of the universe is @xmath310 . in string",
    "theory the smallest _ physical _ size of the universe is @xmath113 .    note that the arguments leading to the string uncertainty principle - that the smallest observable size of an elementary string is @xmath113 - and the arguments leading to the same minimum physical size of the universe both make essential use of probes in thought experiments .",
    "also note the difference : while the former argument uses the oscillator modes , the latter rests on the duality between momentum and winding modes ( although the limiting temperature and pressure depend again on the oscillators ) .",
    "all these modes are simultaneously forced upon us as soon as we accept strings as the elementary constituents of nature , and all are governed by a single scale parameter that appears in ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "0.3 cm * a cosmological scenario without initial singularities * : brandenberger and vafa sketch the following scenario .",
    "let us assume that at some point in the future our universe stops expanding and starts contracting and heating up . as the energy density increases to the hagedorn energy density , stringy effects will take over and the temperature will flatten out . if it continues to contract through the duality radius and comes out the ` other side ' , then dual ( analogues of winding ) modes will take over .",
    "the universe will cool and ` expand ' and give rise to dual nucleons , galaxies , stars , planets , life , etc .",
    "what appears to us to be the ` big crunch ' will be a ` big bang ' for the dual observers .",
    "the process could repeat giving rise to an oscillatory universe . `",
    "our own ' big bang was just one such periodic occurrence .",
    "of course much more work is needed to justify any such _ dynamical _ scenario .",
    "we have been concerned with just those aspects which hinge only on the _ degrees of freedom_. a body of literature now exists which also deals with the time evolution of the metric and other low energy modes in string theory in the cosmological context ( see tseytlin and vafa ( 1992 ) , gasperini ( 1997 ) , the contribution by bose ( 1997 ) to these proceedings , and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps it would be worthwhile to revisit some of this in the light of the expression for the pressure of a string gas presented here , since pressure as part of the energy momentum tensor is a source in the field equations .",
    "nevertheless the above scenario is important in that it at least allows us to _ imagine _ how initial singularities might be avoided in string theory .",
    "it is important to emphasize that singularities are avoided not by recourse to quantum gravity ( spacetime has all along been treated classically ) but simply by a reinterpretation of what it means to talk of a small universe in the light of string theory . in point particle theories",
    ", classical imagination fails at @xmath311 .",
    "this is an example of how the new degrees of freedom in string theory allow ( or rather , necessitate ) a new perspective on our ideas of spacetime , in this case specifically on our notion of the size of the universe .",
    "it should be mentioned that while we have explicitly discussed the case of a toroidal compactification for simplicity , the t - duality symmetry which makes this reinterpretation possible holds for a much larger class of string models ( and is expected to be a symmetry in a nonperturbative formulation of string theory ) .",
    "a limiting temperature and pressure in the ideal gas approximation also seem to be a universal feature of strings in compact spaces .    0.3 cm * cautionary remarks * : at this point some caveats are in order .",
    "thermodynamics in the presence of gravity must take into account the jeans instability . at constant energy density",
    "a sufficiently large volume will be susceptible to gravitational collapse .",
    "this places an upper limit on the value of @xmath163 for which our thermodynamic considerations are valid .",
    "second , the results are based on an ideal gas approximation , used in a regime of high energy densities , greater than the string energy scale itself .",
    "this is justified only if the coupling is weak ( @xmath125 ) . even for a fixed weak coupling",
    "the approximation can be expected to break down at sufficiently high energy densities , at which point non - perturbative effects will need to be taken into account .",
    "this places a lower limit on @xmath163 for the validity of the approximation .",
    "thus there is possibly a window @xmath312 , @xmath313 ( and the ` dual window ' @xmath314 ) in which one can expect this to be valid .",
    "the window expands in both directions as coupling becomes weaker ( see atick and witten ( 1988 ) for related arguments ) .",
    "in addition to string interaction and nonperturbative effects in the region of @xmath163 close to @xmath113 , we face the uncertainty of interpretation of spacetime itself at such small scales . for sufficiently large ( or sufficiently small ) @xmath163 , spacetime may be treated classically , as we have done .",
    "but this is questionable near the duality radius .",
    "this is the regime where the universe as well as its elementary constituents have the same ` size ' .",
    "this problem awaits a better understanding of spacetime in string theory .    0.3 cm * possible observational consequences , further questions * : assuming that there was an era in the past where the ideal string gas approximation was valid",
    ", could there be some observable relic ?",
    "from the picture of how energy is distributed in the string gas it seems likely that density fluctuations would have a different character in the stringy era , and as seeds for later structure formation could have observable consequences .",
    "second , it would be interesting to look for signatures of compactness at very large scales in the universe .",
    "apart from a resolution of the singularity problem , string thermodynamics also seems to be internally consistent only in compact spaces .",
    "a compact universe is even otherwise natural in string theory , since the extra dimensions in any case have to be compact .    at a more theoretical level",
    ", it may be worthwhile to investigate dynamical mechanisms based on string modes ( see brandenberger and vafa ( 1989 ) for a proposal ) for why only three spatial dimensions are large .",
    "also it is of interest to study how the recent progress in our understanding of some non - perturbative aspects of string theory affects the above considerations .",
    "note added : after this writeup was submitted for the proceedings , i became aware of other papers ( yoneya 1989 ; konishi , paffuti and provero 1990 ; kato 1990 ; susskind 1994 ) which attempt to derive the string uncertainty principle .",
    "the argument presented in the present article is different from those given in these papers .",
    "other recent references of related interest are li and yoneya 1997 , which argues that the string uncertainty principle is consistent with d - brane dynamics , as well as barbon and vazquez - mozo 1997 and lee and thorlacius 1997 , which attempt to include d - branes within superstring statistical mechanics .",
