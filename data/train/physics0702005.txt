    "the carbon oxysulfide ( ocs ) molecule is well known to be of considerable importance for the role it plays in the carbon chemistry and sulphur chemistry chains of reactions in molecular astrophysics environments like those in the diffuse and dark interstellar clouds ( disc)@xcite .",
    "it is also of interest in the realm of cold molecular plasmas because of its function as a reaction quencher into the plasma formation .",
    "it follows , therefore , that collisional processes induced by low - energy electrons in this molecular gas have triggered the interest of both experimentalists and theoreticians , intrigued by the possible role that the permanent dipole of this target molecule can play in characterizing the scattering attributes .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "earlier calculations were carried out by lynch et al.@xcite using their continuum scattering model , with which they found the presence of a @xmath0 symmetry shape resonance around 1.15 ev and a sharp increase at threshold of the @xmath1 symmetry partial cross section .",
    "the differential cross sections ( dcss ) for elastic scattering and for vibrational excitations were measured by sohn and coworkers @xcite , where the authors also observed a @xmath2 resonance and a strong excitation of the bending mode associated to dipole coupling and to a possible bound state of @xmath3 .",
    "further measurements are due to szmytkowski et al .",
    "@xcite who measured the total , integral cross sections of the title molecule and confirmed a @xmath0-type resonance around 1.15 ev .",
    "more recent measurements have been carried out by the japanese group @xcite , who compared similar measurements with electrons and positrons as projectiles and confirmed the presence of the @xmath2 resonance around 1.15 ev .",
    "the vibrational excitation of ocs has been measured by another study from the same group @xcite .",
    "calculations of elastic cross sections , integral and differential , and of the momentum transfer cross sections have been performed by bettega et al .",
    "@xcite , who employed the schwinger multichannel method with pseudopotentials within the static - exchange approximation and examined a range of energies from 5 to 50 ev .",
    "a combined theoretical - experimental study has been conducted by michelin et al .",
    "@xcite who carried out both measurements and calculations in the energy regime from 0.4 ev to 600 ev . further calculations of both integral and differential cross sections were reported very recently by bettega et al .",
    "@xcite , who employed again the schwinger multichannel method with pseudopotentials , adding the polarization interaction to their static - exchange initial scheme . a further `` addendum '' to the above results",
    "was recently published with regard to the @xmath1-symmetry partial cross sections @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we intend to discuss in some detail the behavior of the computed angular distributions with respect to the available experiments over a very broad range of collision energies , using an entirely different method as that employed by the earlier , just as extensive , calculations of references @xcite .",
    "the following section describes briefly our theoretical and computational approach while section iii reports our results for both the partial integral cross sections and the differential cross sections . the last section iv summarizes our present conclusions .",
    "one of the major requests from accurate calculations of low energy electron - molecule scattering observables is the correct description of the non - local part of the interaction potential . for electronically elastic collisions , a physically realistic treatment usually starts with the static interaction and views the exchange potential as a correction to the latter due to the imposition of anti - symmetry on the total electronic wavefunction that describes the scattered electron plus the target bound electrons . even in this case , however , the correct treatment of non - local forces for polyatomic molecules still represents a rather formidable task and therefore increasing use is being made of separate representations which expand the exchange kernel in terms of products of one - electron functions @xcite .",
    "this approach will be adopted in the present paper , following our extension of this method to polyatomic molecular targets @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of being a non - empirical method for treating exchange forces while still offering computational savings with respect to the exact solution of the integro - differential equations of non - local electron - molecular scattering theory @xcite",
    ". the earlier work on separate exchange in electron collision with small diatomics has been rather encouraging since fairly small exchange basis sets added little more computer time than a local potential calculation @xcite and therefore we use such an approach on the linear polyatomic target of the present study .",
    "one starts by approximating the exchange potential @xmath4 by the truncated separate form    @xmath5    where the @xmath6 now constitute an additional , new set of cartesian gtos not orthogonal to each other , nor to the occupied molecular orbitals ( mos ) of the target scf basis set which describes the ground state of the target molecule .",
    "the vector coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the positions of the bound and of the scattered electrons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath9 now represents the two - electron interaction operator over the truncated , discrete basis .    when performing the separable expansion ( 1 ) care",
    "should be taken of how to specify the exchange basis functions @xmath6 in order to avoid taking too large an expansion so that the calculations become too massive or begin to suffer from linear dependency effects .",
    "we have carefully checked this aspect of the problem by analysing in each case the corresponding eigenvectors of the overlap matrix and modifying the basis set accordingly .",
    "the required exchange matrix elements for the bound mos of the target , taken to be a closed - shell structure , are therefore given by first calculating the following matrix elements , via a standard bielectronic subroutine    @xmath10    in the above equation @xmath11 denotes the set of doubly occupied self - consistent - field ( scf ) target mos .",
    "hence , using ( 1 ) one can further write    @xmath12    our further compact the overlap integrals    @xmath13    one can finally obtain the bound - continuum scattering matrix from the separable representation by writing it down via the following product of the matrices already defined in the above equations :    @xmath14    where the @xmath15 are the overlap matrix elements between the additional gto set and the original expansions describing the bound mos .      within a single - centre expansion ( sce ) of the continuum wavefunction and of the interaction potential ,",
    "the use of the present static - separable - exchange approximation gives rise to a set of coupled integro - differential equations    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    which integrates over real spherical harmonics to yield the radial part of each new gto function . here",
    "the @xmath19 s are the orbital used in equation ( 2 )",
    ".    furthermore    @xmath20    with the parity index p=0 or 1 and where the same equation ( 8) also holds for the @xmath21 variable in ( 6 ) .",
    "one can now express the solution as a linear combination of homogeneous and inhomogeneous terms :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    @xmath24    the coefficients @xmath25 are found to satisfy a set of linear equations    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    the final numerical integration of the ensuing volterra equations was then carried out as already described in jain and norcross @xcite .",
    "the interatomic distances were fixed at their experimental values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the two components of the dipole polarisability tensor were taken also , in the asymptotic interaction , to be the experimental values : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the above choice was dictated by our desire to realistically treat low - energy effects which are known to be strongly affected by polarisabilities .    to describe the target electrons in the neutral ground state we employed a double - zeta d95v basis set plus polarization orbitals as in the expansion described as d95v@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the obtained total energy was therefore -1020.4122528 hartrees , with a dipole of 0.32 a.u . and a quadrupole of 0.87 a.u .",
    ", to be computed with the experimental values of 0.27 a.u . for the dipole @xcite .",
    "no experimental value of the molecular quadrupole was found to be available .",
    "the radial grid chosen for the volterra integrals went from 0.005 @xmath34 to 10.0 @xmath34 , beyond which the integration was extended out to 1,000 @xmath34 using the asymptotic static multipoles plus the polarization potential .",
    "the multipolar went up to @xmath35=70 while the bound orbitals were expanded around the center of mass up to @xmath36=118 .",
    "table i reports the additional gto s employed to describe the separable exchange and used in the dynamical calculations outlined in the previous section .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the single - center partialwave expansion of the discretized , continuum orbitals employed to treat exchange involved @xmath36=15 for the @xmath37 symmetry , @xmath36=20 for the @xmath0 symmetry and @xmath36=15 for the @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "the above set of functions was the result of a series of numerical tests at a set of chosen energies where we increased the number and quality of the additional gto s until the corresponding , final k - matrix elements varied by less than 0.1% .",
    "the results reported by figure 1 analyze the partial and total integral , elastic cross sections ( rotationally summed ) for their overall energy dependence over the broad range of energies which is experimentally available @xcite , but we only report a comparison with some of the data in order not to crowd the figure excessively .",
    "we also show in the lower panel the energy behavior of the individual partial cross sections for the contributing partial symmetries .",
    "-(solid line ) , @xmath0-(dashes ) and @xmath38-(dots ) symmetries . ]",
    "it is reassuring to see that the present calculations follow closely the experimental findings from below 1.0 ev of energy and up to 100 ev : this is a rather good result considering the complexity of the molecule and the broad range of energies spanned by the calculations .",
    "furthermore , we see that the resonance position is obtained reasonably well from our calculations , albeit with a sharper peak due to the absence of vibrational averaging , which also come very close to the recent calculations of bettega et al",
    ". @xcite that employed an entirely different method for obtaining it .",
    "the lower panel in the figure reports the energy dependence of the various partial cross sections which contribute to the scattering process .",
    "the calculations clearly show that :",
    "in other words , we see the dominant presence of a forward scattering behavior of the dcss unless we are at the resonance position , where the orbiting features of the trapped electron distorts the effects coming from the permanent dipole of the target molecule .",
    "since the experimental data for the angular distributions are available over a broad range of collision energies , we have analyzed them rather carefully from above the dominant @xmath39 resonance out to about 100 ev . the comparisons with the measured data are shown in figures from 5 through 7 .",
    "the following comments could be made from a perusal of the data shown in those figures :    1 .",
    "the present calculations are seen to follow measurements remarkably well , both in shape and size , over the whole energy range ; 2 .   at 5.0",
    "ev the data from sohn et al.@xcite differ from those of tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite in the small - angle region since they indicate there a strong forward peaking of the angular distributions : our calculated values follow those measurements very accurately , thereby confirming the experimental findings in that angular regime ; 3 .",
    "as the collision energy increases one sees an increasing flattening of the dcss as a function of the scattering angle and the appearance of the forward peaks at increasingly smaller angles : the calculations follow suit in the sense that indeed show the same general behavior as that indicated by the experiments .",
    "the calculations discussed in this work have analyzed , using a quantum treatment of the scattering dynamics , the elastic cross sections for electron impact on the ocs target molecule in the gas phase .",
    "in particular , we have employed the exact description of the static potential and a separable representation of the exchange potential , both represented via a single - center expansion , and we have further added correlation - polarization effects via a density functional formulation that we have discussed many times before @xcite .",
    "the corresponding integro - differential equations have been solved via quadratures of volterra equations as discussed in section ii and the angular distributions have been computed including the born dipole corrections beyond the partialwave value of @xmath36=30 @xcite .",
    "the final results for the integral cross sections indeed confirm the presence , around 1 ev of collision energy , of a narrow and intense shape resonance of @xmath0-symmetry associated to a well - known @xmath39 resonance for the title system ( e.g- see discussion in ref.s@xcite .",
    "it also suggests the presence of further two resonances of @xmath39 and @xmath42 symmetry and larger widths , together with a clear ramsauer - townsend minimum in the cross sections around 0.7 ev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the various available angular distributions for the elastic scattering have also been analyzed over a very broad range of collision energies , spanning nearly 100 ev , and compared with the existing experiments and with the earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "the comparison of all the distribution data were presented in the previous section and they show fair agreement between the measurements and with other computations @xcite .",
    "the present calculations also show particularly good correspondence between computed and measured distributions for energies from 3.0 ev and up to 100 ev . considering the complex , many - electron structure of the target and the broad range of collision dynamics which has been analyzed",
    ", our results do indicate the robustness of the adopted dynamical integrator and the reliability of the theoretical modelling which we have employed in this study .",
