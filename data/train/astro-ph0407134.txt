    "gravitational lensing is one of the main tools to obtain information about the structure and evolution of the universe . in particular , time delay measurements are a recent primary distances indicator , furnishing a new method to estimate the hubble constant @xmath0 , which determines the present expansion rate of the universe ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    actually , in 1964 , refsdal proposed to estimate @xmath2 @xcite from multiply imaged qsos by the measurements of the delays in the arrive time between light rays coming from the different images , which follow different optical paths .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the time delay between two images due to a gravitational lens can be factorized in two pieces : the first one depends on cosmological parameters and is inversely proportional to @xmath0 , while the second one is determined by the lens model only .",
    "thus , having measured time delays among images of a lensed qso , once we fix the cosmological parameters , we can obtain a direct estimate of @xmath2 provided that the lens model has been recovered from the lensing constraints , or is known in an other independent way .",
    "nowadays , there are more than sixty multiple image systems @xcite , but only about ten of them have measured time delays . however , this number is increasing day by day , and in the future it will be possible to measure time delays for many other systems .",
    "it is well known hat the most significant uncertainty affecting the estimate of @xmath0 with the refsdal method is only related to the mass model used . in the usual approach",
    "the model parameters are recovered by fitting some parametric models to the available constraints through @xmath4 minimization techniques .",
    "instead , other authors ( see @xcite ) carried out the `` pixellated lens '' modelling , that describes the mass distribution by a large number of discrete pixels with arbitrary densities , so determining the hubble constant by means of a set of physical motivated constraints .",
    "a compromise between these two approaches consists in the numerical solution of a set of non linear equations : in a previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter ccrp02 ) , for instance , some of us applied a semianalytical technique to fit the separable potential of the form @xmath5 and were able to develop an algorithm to estimate @xmath0 without the need to give an explicit expression for the shape function @xmath6 .    here",
    ", we further improve the general method in @xcite ( hereafter ccrp01 ) and ccrp02 , implementing a set of _ mathematica _ codes to shape quadruple lens systems and obtain a better estimate of the hubble constant .",
    "such a method in fact allows us to manage a still wider class of lens models and to obtain useful information about lens parameters and @xmath2 , eliminating possible not physical solutions .",
    "actually , we consider both separable models , specifying the angular part @xmath6 , and models with constant mass - to - light ratio . as usually in literature , we develop the potential of an external object contributing to the lensing phenomenon to second order , and hence its effect on the total deflection potential translates into an external shear term @xcite .",
    "we constrain the lens models using the image positions with respect to the lens centre and the time delay ratios , which allow us to highly constrain the used models , even if the equations to be solved become more complex .",
    "once the results from all the possible models are collected together , such a procedure offers the advantage of giving an estimate of the hubble constant which is in a sense _ marginalized _ with respect to the lens models .",
    "moreover , our numerical method allows to pursue a new kind of approach to the lens modelling , that considers at the same time several lens systems .",
    "actually , following @xcite , we try to model two lensed systems with the elliptical potential @xmath7 and an external shear , based on a strong hypothesis we make _ ab initio _ : we suppose that the lens systems has a shared @xmath2 . in this way we are able to create a two - system model that can give a more complete estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ lens equation and time delay ] we write the lens equations and the time delay function in polar coordinates .",
    "a careful presentation of the models we use is given in sect .",
    "[ lens models ] , while sect .",
    "[ single system ] is devoted to the presentation of the numerical method used to ` fit ' single lens models to systems .",
    "we also discuss the constraints used to select physically motivated solutions and the statistical approach to obtain the final estimate of the parameters . then in sect .",
    "[ two - lens - model ] we present a new approach to shape two lens systems with a shared @xmath2 .",
    "in order to verify whether our codes are able or not to recover the correct values of parameters , we build simulated systems to which we apply the codes as described in sect .",
    "[ simulated systems ] , where , in addition , we analyze the biases and the uncertainties in the use of a model respect to another one . in sect . [ correlations ] , we use the simulated systems to investigate the existence of degeneracies among the model parameters , recovering some interesting scaling laws .",
    "[ applications ] is dedicated to the application of our procedure to two real quadruple systems , pg 1115 + 080 and rx j0911 + 0551 : we obtain an estimate of the lensing parameters and the hubble constant , also taking into account the contribution of changing the cosmological parameters to the uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we present a discussion of our results and future improvements in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "let us choose a rectangular system @xmath8 centered on the lens galaxy and with axes pointing towards west and north , respectively .",
    "let @xmath9 be the polar coordinates , being @xmath10 the position angle measured from north to east , connected to the rectangular ones through the following coordinate transformation :    @xmath11    time delay function , i.e. time delay of a generic path from source to observer , is given by @xcite : @xmath12 , \\label{timedelay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 determines the impact position of the generic path on the lens plane ( with @xmath13 measured in arcsec ) , @xmath14 is the unknown source position , and @xmath15 is the adimensional lensing potential .",
    "then , @xmath16 is the hubble constant @xmath2 in units of @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is a typical time delay linked to cosmological parameters , and defined as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are observer - lens , observer - source , and lens - source angular diameter distances , calculated with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the lens redshift .",
    "this factor contains all the cosmological information , since the distance depend on the other cosmological parameters : i.e. the density matter parameter @xmath25 , the `` dark energy '' contribution @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) and the smoothness parameters @xmath27 introduced in @xcite to take into account the inhomogeneities of the universe .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two images , the time delay between them is @xmath30 .    according to fermat principle ,",
    "the images lie at the critical points of @xmath31 , so one can obtain lens equations minimizing it .",
    "we get :    @xmath32    @xmath33    we shall use a lensing potential formed by the sum of two terms :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the contribution of the lens galaxy , and @xmath36 is the external perturbation .",
    "the first term is connected with the mass distribution of the galaxy through the poisson equation :    @xmath37    being @xmath38 the convergence , i.e. , the adimensional surface mass density , defined as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "the second term describes the effects on the lensing system of the environment , i.e. , of the cluster of galaxies which the lens galaxy belongs to , or an external group of galaxies .",
    "we describe this contribution developing the lensing potential of the external perturbation to the second order :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the external shear and @xmath43 is the shear angle , oriented from north to east and pointing towards the external perturbation .",
    "the majority of the lens galaxies are early - type galaxies , since lensing selects galaxies by mass and the fact that early type galaxies are more massive than spirals overwhelms the fact that spirals are slightly more numerous .",
    "early type galaxies show a wide variety of optical shapes including oblate , prolate and triaxial spheroids .",
    "moreover , also their mass distribution is not yet fully understood : stellar dynamics and x ray observations all suggest that the early type galaxies are dominated by dark matter halos ; on the other hand , some dynamical studies recently performed using planetary nebulae as tracers in the halos of early - type galaxies show evidence of a universal declining velocity dispersion profile , and dynamical models indicate the presence of little dark matter within @xmath44  implying halos either not as massive or not as centrally concentrated as cdm predicts @xcite .",
    "so not only a fundamental hypothesis of the cdm paradigm have been remained up to now largely unverified  that there should be similarly extended , massive dark halos around ellipticals  , but predictions about the detailed halo properties have not been testable .",
    "gravitational lensing is actually an unique tool to studying elliptical halos , and face the question about the nature and the distribution of dark matter in early type galaxies , with implications on the estimation of the hubble constant . in order to consider both a luminous - dominated and dark - dominated component in the main lens galaxy , we consider two different classes of models : separable potentials and constant mass - to - light ( @xmath45 ) mass profiles .        ' '' ''    model & @xmath46 +    ' '' ''    model 1 & @xmath47 +    ' '' ''    model 2 & @xmath48 +    ' '' ''    model 3 & @xmath49 +      for the first class , we assign the lensing potential in a simple separable form :    @xmath50    where we have explicitly indicated the dependence of the angular part @xmath51 on the axial ratio @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and the position angle @xmath54 that specifies the orientation of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the potentials ( [ psisep ] ) are a generalization of the pseudoisothermal elliptical potentials ( piep ) studied by @xcite .",
    "this kind of model is in many aspects similar to the pseudoisothermal elliptic mass distribution ( piemd ) models , such as the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) @xcite .",
    "however , while piemd models can represent mass models with any elongation , piep models represent physically plausible lenses only for some values of the axial ratio @xmath52 , such as @xmath55 , being @xmath56 a suitable value of the axial ratio of the isopotential contours @xcite . for @xmath57 , the elliptical isodensity profile may in fact be boxy or disky . in particular , when dealing with these elliptical models , we adopt the following expression for the angular part :    @xmath58^ { 1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is oriented from west to north .",
    "the angular part @xmath59 also depends on a strength parameter b : for a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath60 and @xmath61const ) this parameter depends on the cosmological parameters and the redshifts by means of a distance ratio , and on the central velocity dispersion . in our case",
    "we can assume a similar dependence only for _ model 3 _ ( see table [ tabella - potenziali - separabili ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tabella - potenziali - separabili ] we give the expression of @xmath62 for the three different models we consider .",
    "_ model 1 _ is spherically symmetric , and hence the shape function is @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "both _ model 2 _ and _ 3 _ are ellipticals , but for _ model 2 _ we fix @xmath64 as for isothermal mass distributions , while @xmath65 is unfixed for _ model 3_.    it is worth to note that , since the lensing potential @xmath62 and the adimensional surface density @xmath66 are related by a double integration , the ellipticity of the isopotential contours is different by that of isodensity ones .",
    "therefore , we have to obtain a relation between the axial ratio @xmath52 of the potential and the isodensity axial ratio , named @xmath67 . for _ model 2 _ ,",
    "the convergence is :    @xmath68    it is easy to see that @xmath66 is always positive , i.e. , _ model 1 _ is always correctly defined , and the analytical relation @xmath69 holds .",
    "things get more complicated for _ model 3_. the convergence now turns out to be :    @xmath70    @xmath71\\ ] ]    @xmath72^{-\\frac{3}{2 } }                 \\ .\\ ] ]    it is possible to see that , if one of the two factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 is negative , then is @xmath75 . in particular , if @xmath76 , we always have @xmath77 , since the two quantities above are positive ; instead , when @xmath78 , the convergence @xmath66 is negative if @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the convergence is negative .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath67 satisfies the relation @xmath82 that corresponds to more rapid trends for lower values of @xmath65 .      the second class we consider contains models that describe luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we use the de vaucouleurs @xcite and hubble ( ref ) models ( respectively _ model 4 _ and _ 5 _ ) , whose convergence @xmath66 is given in table [ tabella - dens - m / l ] .",
    "we assume that the mass density is spherically symmetric , so that we can avoid any difficulties in solving the lens equations for these models .",
    "given the surface density @xmath66 , the deflection angle is easily obtained as @xcite :    @xmath83    and then the deflection potential is evaluated solving the equation @xmath84 .

    "developing the general method used in ccrp01 and ccrp02 to model quadruply lensed systems , we numerically solve systems of nonlinear equations , imposing on the sample of solutions some criteria to select only the physical ones , that have to be collected together by means of an appropriate statistical analysis .      here",
    ", we consider separable models with an assigned angular part and more complex mass models for which it is necessary to assign the surface density @xmath66 . in order to take into account all of the information that come from a lensing event , we make use of time delay ratios , that allow to constrain the lensing parameters quite efficiently .",
    "we do not use flux ratios since these may be contaminated by microlensing @xcite , and other effects , such as those due to substructures in the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "instead , time delays are well measured for some quasars with great accuracy and are less affected by spurious ( and uncontrollable ) effects .",
    "the unknown parameters to be determined are the source position @xmath14 , the shear quantities ( @xmath87 , the main lens model parameters ( different for each model ) , and the hubble constant @xmath2 . actually , the higher complexity of the models and the introduction of the time delays as constraints lead to more complicated equations than those considered in ccrp01 and ccrp02 , and it is not possible to manipulate them to reduce the set of lensing equations ( [ timedelay ] ) , ( [ eqlens1 ] ) and ( [ eqlens2 ] ) to a simpler form so as to speed up the calculations .",
    "let us write equations ( [ eqlens1 ] ) and ( [ eqlens2 ] ) using the four images @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and the two equations coming from the time delay ratios among them , that are independent on h :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the measured time delays .",
    "the introduction of these two other equations permits to rise the equations number , allowing to give a different constraint by the images positions that does not depend on the first derivative of the potential , but only on the potential .    in summary ,",
    "we consider the observables without the errors , using their mean values : while for the image positions this assumption seems immediately justified , for the time delays the uncertainties can be considerably large . in a next section",
    ", we will show more accurately which this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we have a number of 10 equations ( 8 from lens equations and the 2 due to the time delay ratios ) , that we combine in a useful manner to reduce their number to the unknowns number .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath94 the unknowns are 6 , i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath97 , and @xmath65 , with in addition the hubble constant .",
    "we have to subtract the 8 lens equations to reduce their number to 4 , and we then add the two time delay ratios to complete the system of 6 equations in 6 unknowns .",
    "we use the same procedure for each model to obtain a system of @xmath98 equations and @xmath98 unknowns .",
    "we can numerically solve this system of @xmath98 equations to obtain @xmath98 unknown parameters ( for our models @xmath98 is less than 10 ) .",
    "each result of the solution of the system will be a set of @xmath98 values .",
    "when we go to solve the system , we do not obtain a single solution , but a set of solutions , since the system is highly non linear ; these solutions have to be selected by means of some selection criteria in order to obtain values of parameters which give rise to physically plausible models .",
    "the search for the roots of the system begins with a choice of a range of parameter values : one must be sure that there are no roots outside the chosen range , and also a very large interval does not necessarily include all roots , increasing cpu time .",
    "we choose a physically acceptable interval for parameters , giving @xmath99 random starting points to the algorithm , where @xmath99 is a number fixed by the user should be large enough to explore a wide region in the parameter space , but not too large so as to minimize cpu time .",
    "a possible strategy is to fix @xmath99 to a suitable value ( for example , 2000 or 10000 ) and run the code more than one time . ] . from these starting points",
    "the cpu tries to converge to the solutions , using the newton s method .",
    "in particular , to assign the same probability to the starting values of a parameter in the relative range , we generate these values uniformly distributed , also to avoid introducing any bias in the search .",
    "we have developed a simple code , named lepre , lensing parameters reconstruction , written for _",
    "mathematica_. generally , solving the equation system yields @xmath100 solutions , because for some values of the starting points newton s method fails to converge to a solution .",
    "these @xmath101 solutions are not all physically acceptable and to sort among these we have to impose a set of selection criteria , that constrains parameter values to physically plausible ranges .",
    "schematically , we can describe these selection criteria as following .    1 .   @xmath102 : a lens will not produce images arbitrarily far away from the center of the lens",
    "; for large values of @xmath95 , there will be one image only at @xmath103 , and possibly others near the center of the lens ; in particular , we impose this cut because if the source is outside the ring delineated by the most distant of the images it is not possible to generate a 4-images configuration ) . ] .",
    "@xmath104 : the shear magnitude is positive by definition . for the separable models , we choose as upper limit @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is defined such that for values of @xmath107 the estimated @xmath2 becomes null , and depends on the particular lens system to be considered @xcite . for pg 1115 + 080 is @xmath108 , instead for rx j0911 + 0551 is @xmath109 . for",
    "axially symmetric lenses we can not fix an upper limit ( since the hypothesis made in @xcite does not work ) , but in the analysis it is possible to obtain estimated value of @xmath42 higher than the one obtained for an elliptical separable model .",
    "_ the shear is approximately well directed _",
    ": we mean that the position angle @xmath43 must be directed towards the external mass disturbance ; e.g. , if the shear were due to an external group of galaxies , then @xmath43 should be aligned with the cluster mass centre , since there are no reasons why it should point elsewhere . for the axially symmetric models this cut is not necessary because an exact value of @xmath43 is selected automatically from the system solution to account for image configuration .",
    "instead , for an elliptical model , we have to take into account the degeneracy existing between external asymmetry ( the shear @xmath42 and relative orientation @xmath43 ) and internal asymmetry provided by axial ratio @xmath52 and angle @xmath54 .",
    "quantitatively , one could accept only values comprised in the range @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are respectively two extreme galaxies that bound the external group of galaxies .",
    "the elliptical profile of the galaxy has to be physically plausible _ :",
    "we assume @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a particular value of @xmath52 such that , for fixed value of @xmath65 , the isodensity profile is elliptical or nearly elliptical , and not strongly boxy ; so , we avoid those kinds of solutions to select the physically plausible one .",
    "the range for other galaxy model parameters is chosen to have plausible values of @xmath66_. for _ model 1 _ and _ model 3 _ we must have @xmath115 ; as a matter of fact , the surface mass density scales as @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 is needed in order to have @xmath66 monotonically decreasing with @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "we consider @xmath118 in order for the projected mass inside @xmath13 ( that scales as @xmath119 ) to be reasonable . since @xmath120",
    ", we have to assume the condition @xmath121 for the strength parameter .",
    "_ plausible index ind(@xmath66)_. the index is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "a lower bound can be fixed considering that @xmath66 has to be higher than the luminous profile ; an upper bound for pg 1115 + 080 is fixed following @xcite , i.e. , @xmath123 . for power law model",
    "this selection criterium reduces to @xmath124 .",
    "the set of parameters so found solves lens equations and time delay ratios equations_. we insert the solutions in solved equations , to check if the solution found is the correct one or a result from wrong convergence of the numerical algorithm .",
    "we impose that the values of parameters so found verify the equations within an accuracy fixed by the user .",
    "8 .   @xmath125 . from the three time delays we obtain three values of @xmath16 ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) to give more freedom to the obtained solution and to take into account that we are using a numerical method . ] , and eliminate all the solutions such that the predicted values of these three @xmath16 s differ more than an @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) from each other .",
    "then , we estimate @xmath131 , selecting only those solutions which give rise to values of @xmath16 in the range @xmath132 , being these two parameters fixed by the user . an upper bound is given by age of globular clusters and by the limits from nucleochronology , which indicate an age of the universe of @xmath133 ; instead , a lower bound on @xmath16 can be given by @xmath134 , since we do not observe stellar systems with ages greatly exceeding this value .",
    "in particular , to be conservative , we choose @xmath135 .",
    "obviously , one can also change the order of the constraints , and remove or add some of these . at the end of the application of such selection criteria , and after having run the code more times , we get a set of @xmath136 solutions . it is clear that there is a family of different combinations of the parameters , that is consistent with the observables and the selection criteria .",
    "it is possible to interpret the final sample of the solutions for each parameter using the concept of bayesian probability .",
    "in this particular framework , the lensing parameters and @xmath2 represent the `` variables '' of the `` system '' , that are linked by a series of `` relationships '' , that need not be single - valued , i.e. , the lens mapping and time delay equations .",
    "we can associate to the `` variables '' a single value function , that is usually named `` information '' , or more familiarly `` probability density function '' , which indicates how `` likely '' the particular combination of the parameters is .",
    "our final sample of solutions , collected into the histograms , determines all the amount of `` information '' that we obtain about the `` system '' itself .",
    "this sample is a subset of the parameter space , that contains all we have to know about the `` system '' . to extract a final result",
    ", we have to select a better estimate of each parameter , making a reasonable choice .",
    "we could use a figure of merit as made by @xcite , but here we use the mean value of all the collected values as final estimate for each parameter , instead for the uncertainty on this estimate we think to be conservative in the choice of the 68% confidence level , i.e. , the range in which the 68% of the solutions is included .",
    "in the first place , this choice works well in the simulations .",
    "then , we argue that our choice allows to take into account the weight of each single result in the sample .",
    "when the distribution of the values is symmetric , other choices as the maximum or the median are equivalent , but in some cases the histograms have a degree of asymmetry , different for each lensing model and quasar system , due to the particular configuration of the images , the degeneracies and the available data .    as we said before , by means of a simulated system",
    ", we will see that this estimate of the uncertainty in the parameter determinations in fact allows us to recover the values of these ones .",
    "in a recent paper , saha & williams extract an estimate of @xmath2 by means of the joined use of more lensed systems @xcite . here , we show how it is possible to build a ` two - system ' model fitting two lens systems with general lensing potentials and a shared @xmath2 . in order to obtain a simpler solution to this problem we use an elliptical potential with a not fixed angular part @xmath137 and external shear @xmath138 already used in ccrp02 . as shown in that paper",

    "we could solve a system of equations of the form @xmath147 , in order to obtain the 10 parameters @xmath148 .",

    "we calculate the derivatives with respect to the 10 lens parameters and solve this system of 10 equations . following the previous section ,",
    "we impose some selection criteria to select the physical solutions . in this case , in order to reject many unphysical solutions we have to impose a criterion not used previously : i.e. , we require that the source has a more constrained position ] .",
    "this criterion is not arbitrary , since the source can be located only in a little region to be able to generate a particular configuration of the images ( see @xcite ) . after having obtained a sample of solutions we have to calculate the six @xmath140 by different pairs of images and the two systems , and perform the mean of these values ; finally , we impose the constraint on @xmath140 and obtain the final sample of solutions , that gives out the estimates of the parameters .",
    "we want to stress the fact that the algorithm discussed in this sec . and hence the developed method , has as main issue the estimate of @xmath16 .",
    "it does not allow to obtain precise estimate of the position of the source and of the orientation of the external perturbation , since we impose a strong constraint on them , primary in order to obtain the correct estimate of @xmath16 . as we will see later",

    "moreover , it is necessary to take into account the contribution of the second galaxy and the other objects in the group .      for each systems we obtained an estimate of @xmath0 performing a mean of the final distributions obtained fitting each model , and then deriving the mean value and the uncertainty from it .",
    "now , let us combine these results , multiplying the two final distributions .",
    "the final estimate turns out to be : @xmath423 the uncertainties in each estimate and in the final one are high ( also if reduced in this last one with respect to the single systems ) , since it has to take into account all the degeneracies ; however , adding other physical constraints and strengthening some of those already used , it is possible to reduce the errors ulteriorly .",
    "also for the lens parameters there is this kind of problem , above all in the orientation of the lens galaxy and the strength parameters of some models .",
    "we think that this kind of `` marginalized '' estimate of @xmath2 over a large sample of models can help us to overcome the problem of the lack of a correct independent knowledge of the lens model .",
    "in addition to the usual analysis done for each system , we apply to pg 1115 + 080 and rx j0911 + 0551 the new method to simultaneously fit the general elliptical model @xmath424 with external shear . in table",
    "[ tab_common_h_pg_rx ] we collect the results , adding the values obtained for the single systems fitted with the same potential .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimated value for rx j0911 + 0551 are very high as well as for the other models fitted in the paper , showing the presence of difficulties in the fitting performed with these simple models .",
    "the angular trends for the _ two - system model _ and the single systems are similar and there is an agreement for the estimated @xmath425 .",
    "the global estimate of the hubble constant is @xmath426 .",
    "its determination is mainly determined by the uncertainties in the estimate of @xmath0 for pg 1115 + 080 , since the distribution of the recovered for rx j0911 + 0551 is flat , giving us a little quantity of information ( see , for instance , fig .",

    "in @xcite it is obtained @xmath458 , modelling pg 1115 + 080 with two different components so as to describe the luminous part and the dark halo , and using information by stellar dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have presented a numerical method able to estimate lensing parameters and hubble constant for a wide class of models .",
    "the model parameters as well as the hubble constant have been estimated using as constraints the image positions and the time delay ratios .",
    "we used two classes of models : separable elliptical models and constant mass - to - light ratio profiles , adding an external shear to take into account the presence of an external group of galaxy .",
    "for these models we solved the system composed by the combinations of lens equations and two time delay ratios , selecting the solutions by means of suitable physical constraints . for each model and each parameter",
    ", we obtain an ensemble of values : we used the mean as better estimate and a confidence level of @xmath459 as error . in order to reduce the uncertainty due to the lens models on the estimation of the hubble constant ,",
    "marginalized _ over all the models collecting the complete data set and obtained a final estimate of @xmath0 and its error , which does not result dramatically underestimated , in this way , because of an _ a priori _ choice of the model . to test the code we created simulated systems , being able to recover the correct values of parameters .",
    "after the encouraging testing of the codes , we have then applied them to two real systems for which a measure of time delays has been possible : pg 1115 + 080 and rx j0911 + 055 .",
    "for pg 1115 + 080 it was possible to get an estimate of @xmath460 , consistent with other results in the literature , obtained using different techniques .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the isothermal and pseudoisothermal models predict low values of @xmath2 , while the constant mass - to - light ratio ones generate higher values .",
    "we can verify these results using hubble and de vaucouleurs models , finding that a simple elliptical isothermal model as _ model 2 _ predicts a very low value of @xmath2 , in agreement with the value @xmath461 obtained in @xcite . for rx j0911 + 0551",
    ", only the elliptical profile allows to fit the image configuration .",
    "these trends are also confirmed by the simulations .",
    "as previously said , we `` marginalize '' over the models since we do not know the `` correct '' form of the lens model , and hence we have thought to overcome this difficulty in this way . the combination of the two final distribution can help to reduce the uncertainties and to obtain more information from more lens systems , thus should avoid the problems in the fitting of the single systems .",
    "the combined estimate is @xmath462    the uncertainty in the final estimate can be further reduced adding other models and including in the statistics other lensed systems , consistently with the uncertainty obtained using other methods ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider the contribution of the smoothness parameter @xmath27 , the change in @xmath2 can be very high and comparable with uncertainty in our estimates of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the variability for rx j0911 + 0551 is @xmath463 ( using these particular cosmological models ) , with a comparable uncertainty in modelling .",
    "the general method developed in this paper can be used to do more , allowing to obtain an estimate of @xmath0 that is assumed for hypothesis as the ` same ' for all the lensed systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can in fact fit simultaneously the two systems , using a general elliptical potential with a not fixed angular part and a shared @xmath2 .",
    "the final estimate is @xmath464 , lower than the result obtained by means of the marginalization of the 5 models already analyzed in the paper , but in agreement within the uncertainties .",
    "the hypothesis of a common @xmath0 is ambitious and very strong , since we do nt know if different lens system can be fitted in the same manner by using the same lens model and the same @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , fitting different lens models , we have seen that different ones for the two lensed systems give us different values of @xmath0 .",
    "but we think that a `` more - system '' model can help to obtain a reasonable estimate .",
    "further improvements are possible .",
    "it will possible to use other different models , for which it is not possible to write the potential in a simple form , such as nfw profiles ( @xcite ) , or more complex ones ( also realizing more - system models ) . to take into account the different components of the lensing galaxy",
    ", we can use different profiles to describe their components ; for example , it can be used a nearly isothermal model to describe the dark halo and a de vaucouleurs one to describe the luminous profile .",
    "then , we could also use an exponential profile to account for a thin disk , that elliptical galaxies sometimes seem to have .",
    "it is necessary a more accurate modelling of rx j0911 + 0551 in order to give a better bound on the estimated @xmath0 for this system , since we checked that it furnish a little information and a little statistical weight .",
    "then , it is possible to shape double lensed system , also using the flux ratio to better constrain the lens models to systems : we have to use a function of merit similar to that used for the two - system model to allow to have a necessary number of equations .",
    "finally , of course , the application of the single modelling ( after marginalization ) and other two - systems ones to other lens systems with measured time delays can allow to get a more and more accurate and precise estimate of @xmath2 , eliminating biases and errors linked to the use of each lens model .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank p. scudellaro for the interesting discussions we had during the making of this work and the referee p. saha for his significative suggestion in order to improve the paper .",
