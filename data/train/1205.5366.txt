    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is a useful measure to describe fundamental statistical properties of galaxy populations and serves as a clue to study the history of galaxy formation and evolution . since the monumental work of the lf by @xcite ,",
    "relatively bright part of the lf has been studied extensively both for cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and for field galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , our knowledge of the faint part of the lf ( @xmath5 ) , which is dominated by dwarf galaxies , is still very limited .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in determining the distance of a large number of intrinsically faint galaxies .",
    "published results of the faint part of the lf , especially , those of the faintest part ( @xmath6 ) remain scarce .",
    "clusters of galaxies are a good target to investigate the faint end of the lf because some statistical methods can be applied to identify member galaxies . in this study we chose the coma cluster in order to investigate the faint part of the lf , that is , to study properties of dwarf galaxies and their possible dependence on different environments in this cluster .",
    "the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) at @xmath7 ( @xcite ) is the richest cluster of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the virial radius ( @xmath8 ) of this cluster is 2.0 @xmath9 mpc , which corresponds to a virial mass of @xmath10 as estimated from a weak lensing measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to take deep images of this nearby cluster which enables us to reach the faintest part of the lf .",
    "the lf of the coma cluster was studied by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several techniques were used to construct the coma lf .",
    "the statistical background / foreground subtraction is historically the main one ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "others include the spectroscopic redshift technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) , photometric redshift technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) and color magnitude relation technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the faint - end slope of the lf derived from previous studies do not agree with each other and it seems that it depends on the magnitude ranges where the slope was measured , i.e. , the slope is flatter at brighter magnitudes , and it becomes steeper at fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , a simple comparison of the values of the slope may be inappropriate because of the difference in the observed area and galaxy sampling criteria among previous studies .",
    "most previous studies observed the cluster core only , with a few probed outskirts as well as the core .",
    "the aim of the present study is to investigate the behavior of the faint part , especially , the faintest part of the lf of coma cluster using a statistically significant large sample constructed from deep and wide photometric images obtained with the subaru suprime - cam .",
    "our imaging data cover much wider area than most of the previous studies that reached similar limiting magnitudes .",
    "we employ a careful procedure for subtracting the background galaxy population statistically to derive the lfs of the cluster galaxy population .",
    "we investigate the properties of the very faint dwarf population and their possible environmental dependence , if any , in terms of lf , color , and surface brightness .",
    "our galaxy catalogs for the core and the outer areas are constructed by using the same instrument , same filters , and the same selection criteria , which ensures coherent and homogeneous photometric data to allow credible comparisons of galaxy properties in different environments of the cluster .",
    "we adopt the standard cosmology model with @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "magnitudes are on the ab system .",
    "we assume a distance to the coma cluster of 100 mpc and a distance modulus of 35.0 throughout this paper .",
    "we perform @xmath15- and @xmath16-band observations with suprime - cam ( @xcite ) mounted on the subaru telescope ( @xcite ) for a total of three nights , between 12 and 14 may 2007 .",
    "observing conditions were mediocre due to the occasional cloud traversals on all three nights .",
    "the suprime - cam covers a @xmath17 field of view with a pixel scale of @xmath18 pixel@xmath12 .",
    "a typical seeing size was @xmath19 in @xmath15- and @xmath16-band .",
    "we selected three fields in the coma cluster for the present study , and they are hereafter referred to as the coma 1 , coma 2 , and coma 3 fields , respectively . the coma 1 field is located in the central region of the coma cluster .",
    "coma 2 is located at 1.3 mpc projected distance to the southwest of the cluster core , in the postulated infalling region ( @xcite ) .",
    "coma 3 is about 1.8 mpc away from the cluster core , i.e. , the outskirts .",
    "figure [ fig : coma_field ] shows the three observed fields on the digitized sky survey ( dss ) image .",
    "the distribution of x - ray emission is shown in figure [ fig : coma_x ] .",
    "we summarize the details of observation of the coma cluster in table [ tab : coma_data ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we construct the galaxy luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the coma cluster , the richest of the nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "deep and wide images of the coma cluster are obtained with the suprime - cam mounted on the subaru telescope .",
    "the resultant lfs cover the range of @xmath1 . contamination from background galaxies is subtracted statistically using the number counts of galaxies in a blank field , the subaru deep field .      1",
    ".   we derive lfs in the cluster center region ( coma 1 field ) , the ngc 4839 group ( coma 2 field ) and the outskirts ( coma 3 field ) .",
    "no significant differences in the shape of the lfs are found in the different fields of the coma cluster .",
    "2 .   the faint part of lf in the coma cluster contains two distinct components ; the bright dwarf component ( bdc ; @xmath3 ) which has a relatively flat lf slope and the faint dwarf component ( fdc ; @xmath4 ) which has a steep slope .",
    "3 .   most of bdc galaxies are extended and red .",
    "the number of such galaxies increases toward the cluster center .",
    "very few extended and blue galaxies are found in the bdc of all the three fields .",
    "the fraction of blue ( both extended and compact ) galaxies in the bdc ( @xmath20% ) is nearly the same in all the three fields .",
    "4 .   on the other hand",
    ", fdc galaxies are predominantly compact with sizes comparable to the seeing size , fwhm corresponding to @xmath21 kpc at the distance of the coma cluster . most of them are red , but some are blue .",
    "especially , a lot of blue compact galaxies exist in the fdc of coma 3 compared to coma 1 .",
    "in contrast , almost no extended galaxies is found in the fdc of coma 3 .",
    "the extended galaxies of fdc seem to exist only in the dense regions such as the cluster center .",
    "this study is based on the phd thesis of the first author which was accepted in 2010 at the graduate university for advanced studies ( sokendai ) .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the subaru telescope for their help .",
    "we thank margaret milne for providing her coma lf data , nobuo arimoto and tadayuki kodama for discussions .",
    "we would like to thank anonymous referee for his / her helpful suggestions .",
