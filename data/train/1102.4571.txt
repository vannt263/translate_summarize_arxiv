    "short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) are likely produced by neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole mergers ( see e.g. @xcite for an early exploration of this idea ) .",
    "this makes them physically different from long duration grbs , which result from the stellar collapse of a massive star .",
    "the distribution of grb durations is therefore expected ( and found ) to be bimodal rather than continuous @xcite . nevertheless , theoretical models of both types of grb share many similarities , the most important of them being the formation of an ultrarelativistic jet .",
    "sgrb jet models generally probe a different part of the possible parameter space for such jets than long grbs , although some overlap exists with underluminous instances of the latter ( e.g. grb 100316d , @xcite ) .",
    "the overall energy release for sgrbs is of the order @xmath0 ergs ( rather than @xmath1 ergs ) , the circumburst particle densities of order @xmath2 @xmath3 ( rather than 1 @xmath3 ) and they are less collimated ( although there is currently little observational confirmation of the latter , in hydrodynamical models for long grbs , e.g. @xcite , the jet becomes collimated by passing through a dense stellar interior .",
    "this mechanism is absent for sgrbs ) .",
    "reviews of sgrb science can be found in @xcite , @xcite and a recent comparison to long grbs in @xcite .    like long grbs",
    ", short and underluminous grbs produce afterglows peaking at progressively longer wavelengths with time , although they are harder to detect because they are intrinsically fainter .",
    "analytical models of sgrb afterglows suffer from the same simplifications and shortcomings as those of long grbs ( mainly with respect to jet decollimation and off - axis emission ) .",
    "these can be addressed through combining high - resolution relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations with numerical radiative transfer for synchrotron radiation .",
    "such simulations have already been performed for long grbs ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". a more accurate understanding of short grb afterglows is currently especially interesting not only because they are actually being detected starting a few years ago , but also because a new generation of extremely sensitive detectors of sgrbs is becoming operational .",
    "on the one hand there are instruments such as lofar or ska , that will detect sgrb ( afterglow ) emission through the traditional electromagnetic ( em ) channel , but at unprecedented long wavelengths on the order of tens of mhz rather than ghz ( the lower limit goal for ska is 60 mhz , for ska pioneer project askap it is 300 mhz , @xcite . for lofar",
    "it is @xmath4 mhz , @xcite ) .",
    "transient monitoring campaigns with these instruments should be able to detect afterglows even if the prompt emission remains unseen . on the other hand , completely new channels are becoming available for grb detection : multiple gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors are currently in operation ( e.g. ligo , @xcite and virgo , @xcite ) and upgrades are anticipated .",
    "the amount of information that can be obtained from gw detections can be significantly enhanced by information from their em counterparts that can help break degeneracies in gw model fits @xcite .",
    "also , the expected observer time between the gw signal and the peak of the afterglow signal is expected to be on the order of several days at least , so a gw localization can be used to increase the odds of detecting an afterglow .",
    "it is therefore important to accurately understand the relationships between sgrb energy , collimation and observer angle and their observational implications ( see also @xcite ) .    to further our understanding of sgrb afterglows",
    "we have performed a series of two - dimensional rhd simulations of sgrb jets interacting with the circumburst environment . in this letter",
    "we present , for the first time , short grb afterglow light curves for observers positioned both on the jet axis and off - axis that are calculated from rhd simulations and include both synchrotron emission and synchrotron self - absorption . in section [ simulations_section ]",
    "we explain our methods . in section [ typical_case_section ]",
    "we discuss light curves and spectra for a number of cases .",
    "all data are publicly available at http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary , but in addition to this we provide tables showing results for smoothly broken power law fits to the light curves for the cases under discussion .",
    "the fits should be taken as a brief summary of the overall shapes of the light curves , rather than a definitive description that completely captures the underlying physics . in section [ discussion_section ]",
    "we draw conclusions .",
    "we have performed 12 rhd simulations in 2d spherical coordinates using the parallel ram adaptive - mesh refinement code @xcite , four of which we will describe in detail in this paper ( the resulting light curves for the others are publicly available on the website ) . taking a conic section from the blandford - mckee ( bm ) self - similar solution for a relativistic explosion in a homogeneous medium @xcite as starting point",
    ", these simulations cover all possible combinations of the following values for the physical quantities determining the dynamics of the system : energy in both jets @xmath5 or @xmath6 ergs , circumburst number density @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath3 , jet half opening angle @xmath10 , @xmath11 rad .",
    "numerical results for the dynamics of spreading and decelerating bm jets have been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "based on these findings , we have chosen a starting bm jet fluid lorentz factor directly behind the shock front of @xmath12 ( well in excess of @xmath13 , both for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , when lateral spreading is expected to set in ) , a lab frame stopping time @xmath14 and corresponding grid size @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 the speed of light and @xmath17 as defined below ) and a grid resolution such that the initial blast wave width @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 the blast wave radius and @xmath20 the shock lorentz factor ) was resolved by approximately 100 grid cells . in practice , the latter requirement lead us to 24 base level blocks ( of 16 cells each ) in the radial direction and 12 initial levels of refinement .",
    "we have used 2 base level blocks in the angular direction . as in earlier work",
    ", we gradually decreased the peak refinement level over time .",
    "in addition , we kept the peak refinement level for the inner regions of the jet a few levels lower than that of the outer regions .",
    "this avoids spending too much computational effort on resolving kelvin - helmholtz type instabilities in the flow that have little effect on the radiation and overall dynamics .",
    "the time @xmath17 reflects the time when the blast wave was analytically expected @xcite to become nonrelativistic and settle into the self - similar sedov - taylor solution @xcite and is given by @xmath21 here @xmath22 denotes isotropic equivalent energy in units of @xmath23 ergs , related to the energy in both jets according to @xmath24 . the theoretical value for @xmath17 was numerically found to underestimate the transition time and duration to spherical nonrelativistic flow and @xcite found that the transition time is better approximated by @xmath25 .    we have combined simulation output ( 3000 snapshots per simulation ) with a linear radiative transfer code that calculates the observed flux at various observer angles from rays through the evolving fluid , including synchrotron emission and synchrotron self - absorption . the current approach generalizes the radiation code described in @xcite to off - axis observers .",
    "it further differs from these studies in that it follows the simplified approach to the general synchrotron emission used in @xcite that uses a global approach to electron cooling rather than a local one and that in turn has been based on @xcite .",
    "the total number of rays required for a single observation is calculated through a procedure analogous to adaptive mesh refinement , where each possible refinement doubles the number of rays in a single group ( or `` block '' , containing 16 rays ) either in the @xmath26 or @xmath27 direction , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are polar coordinates on the plane perpendicular to the direction of the rays ( i.e. towards the observer ) .",
    "a local total of 9 refinements ( in any combination of radial and angular refinements ) , starting with 24 base level blocks in the radial direction ( @xmath28 - fluid grid maximum ) and 2 in the angular direction ( @xmath29 ) was found to be sufficient to converge on a fixed flux value .",
    "although our method provides us with spatially resolved images for off - axis observers as well as fluxes , these will be presented elsewhere .    as usual in afterglow modeling ,",
    "a number of parameters is used to capture the radiation physics .",
    "the accelerated electron power law slope has been set to @xmath30 , the fraction of accelerated electrons @xmath31 , the energy in these electrons as fraction of the thermal energy @xmath32 , the fraction of thermal energy in the magnetic field @xmath33 .    in order to ensure complete coverage at early observer times",
    "we have used an analytical implementation of the bm solution at fluid lorentz factors @xmath34 rather than simulation output to calculate emission and absorption .",
    "early time contributions have been confirmed to connect smoothly to those from simulation output .",
    "however , even with additional early time contribution , the earliest observer time with effectively full coverage still differs between observer angles .",
    "we haved calculated light curves at the following four frequencies : 75 mhz ( radio , lofar , ska ) , 1.43 ghz ( radio , wsrt , vla ) , @xmath35 hz ( r - band , vlt ) and @xmath36 hz ( @xmath37 kev x - rays , _ swift _ xrt ) . in this letter",

    "nevertheless , the first temporal break @xmath50 can be roughly interpreted as the jet break time for small observer angles . for high observer angles it marks the difference between the rise ( where relativistic beaming dominates the shape of the light curve , e.g. @xcite ) and decay of the signal .",
    "the second and third break @xmath51 , @xmath52 are used to summarize the rise and decline of the counterjet .",

    ". [ lightcurves_figure ] , [ spectra_figure ] and the tabulated results , we draw conclusions regarding the general structure of sgrb light curves . for small observer angles , the results clearly confirm that afterglow jet breaks are _ chromatic _ , which was first reported in @xcite ( albeit there for long grb s , both for 1d top hat jet simulations and a medium - resolution 2d simulation using a different hydrodynamics code ) . at low ( radio ) frequencies , the jet break is consistently postponed with respect to the jet break in the optical and x - ray .",
    "although the fitted break times also differ between optical and x - ray , the current approach that approximates the electron cooling time by the explosion duration is not sufficiently realistic to allow for definitive statements on the chromaticity of the break between the two frequencies ( a detailed treatment of electron cooling lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the practical relevance of off - axis x - ray afterglow light curves for sgrbs is limited ) .",
    "although we have not accounted for this in our fits , the jet break splits into two breaks when the observer moves off - axis . the @xmath62 rad light curves from fig .",
    "[ lightcurves_figure ] provide an example of this : at early times they have again joined their repective on - axis light curves . for observers exactly on edge , only the late time break is left , with the early time break having moved to @xmath63 .",
    "this wide range of jet breaks is unfortunate from a practical point of view .",
    "it means that an equation for the break time @xmath64 such as @xmath65 from @xcite will be consistent with the data ( as can be seen from a comparison to values in tables [ characteristics_table ] and [ characteristics2_table ] ) , but only given the wide range of jet break times across the frequencies . nevertheless , the scalings in eq .",
    "[ jetbreak_time_equation ] are confirmed .",
    "all light curves confirm the clear rise of the counterjet that was both analytically expected ( e.g. @xcite ) and a robust feature of earlier numerical work @xcite .",
    "they show that at late times and for off - axis observers , synchrotron self - absorption ( s.s.a . )",
    "has little effect on the light curves . for case",
    "b , this can be seen directly in fig .",
    "[ spectra_figure ] . for small opening angles and radio frequencies ,",
    "the influences of s.s.a . and",
    "the jet opening angle on the light curve can become hard to disentangle .",
    "the most extreme case is provided by case d , where the circumburst density @xmath66 is the highest .",
    "this is not unexpected given that the synchrotron break frequency @xmath67 scales as @xmath68 when @xmath67 lies below the synchrotron break frequency @xmath69 and as @xmath70 otherwise @xcite .",
    "light curves for large observer angles exhibit a steep rising phase that will be more complex than a straight power law , especially at low frequencies . the low radio light curve plots in fig [ lightcurves_figure ] for @xmath71 equal to 0.8 and @xmath72 provide examples .",
    "this was not reported in earlier numerical studies ( e.g. @xcite , where the early rising part has been truncated from the light curve ) .",
    "it is a genuine feature that depends on the spectral shape rather than lateral spreading and is also seen in simplified analytical models @xcite ) .",
    "a long term feature common to all light curves not fully captured by the power law fits is the gradual transition from relativistic to nonrelativistic flow . at the last observer time",
    "covered the simulations have not yet been nonrelativistic sufficiently long for the expected nonrelativistic slope above @xmath69 of @xmath73 to become dominant ( note that at any given observer time the observed flux is the combined signal from a range of emission times ) . in practice ,",
    "observing a sgrb afterglow fully in the nonrelativistic regime will be exceedingly unlikely .",
    "we have performed a series of high - resolution rhd simulations in 2d to calculate the jet outflow for physical parameters typical of those expected for subenergetic grb s . from these",
    "we have calculated afterglow light curves at various frequencies , covering low radio ( 75 mhz ) up to x - ray ( 1.5 kev ) and for observer angles from 0 to @xmath72 rad .",
    "the data for all light curves from this paper are publicly available via http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary , that also provides results from a more extensive probe of parameter space .",
    "we summarize the light curves via smooth power law fits that capture features such as the jet break for small observer angles , the early time rise due to relativistic beaming for high observer angles and the rise and decay of the counterjet .",
    "the results here present the most accurate calculations to date of light curve predictions of the standard afterglow jet theory as it applies to short grb s , fully accounting for aspects such as jet spreading , observer position and arrival time effects .",
    "although we do not discuss this in detail in this work , the light curves show that sgrb / underluminous afterglows should in principle be observable ( at least in the radio ) even for observers outside the jet cone . the light curves in this paper and in the on - line database should prove useful for detectability estimates using future radio telescopes such as ska and lofar .",
    "such estimates will also benefit the gravitational waves community , since the amount of information that can be extracted from gw measurements increases significantly when em counterparts are observed as well .",
    "furthermore , gw observations can aid the search for em counterparts .    in general , the afterglow light curves",
    "are well described by smooth power law fits with up to three breaks , although sometimes the rising phase for high observer angles is problematic .",
    "the effects of increasing circumburst density and jet energy are as expected from theoretical models .",
    "the jet break for small observer angles varies greatly between frequencies , confirming a result from @xcite .",
    "increasing the observer angle postpones the jet break ( it really splits the break into two separate breaks , but the second break is the strongest ) .",
