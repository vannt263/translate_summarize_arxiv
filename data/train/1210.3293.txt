    "classical driven billiards of varying geometry have been subject to intensive research during the last years @xcite .",
    "while billiards are , in general , important models to study aspects of nonlinear dynamics , semi - classics or ( quantum ) chaos @xcite , driven billiards additionally facilitate the study of non - equilibrium dynamics . as one of the key topics concerning driven billiards , fermi acceleration ( fa ) and",
    "the related conditions for its occurrence have gained much attention @xcite .",
    "fa describes the unbounded growth of energy of particles that repeatedly interact with a time - dependent potential that is usually modeled by a moving billiard boundary and was originally proposed by enrico fermi as a possible mechanism to explain high - energetic cosmic radiation @xcite .",
    "the infamous fermi - ulam model ( fum ) is basically a one - dimensional billiard with a moving boundary and it was found that fa is present in the fum only for non - smooth driving laws @xcite .",
    "the general conditions for the occurrence of fa are still under debate .",
    "originally , it was assumed that a sufficient condition for the occurrence of fa in a driven two - dimensional billiard is the presence of chaotic regions in the phase space of the corresponding static billiard @xcite .",
    "however , it turned out , that driving an ovally shaped billiard which has a mixed phase space in a certain mode does not lead to fa @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that the classical driven elliptical billiard does show fa although its static counterpart is completely integrable @xcite . furthermore , while correlated motion suppresses fa for smooth driving in the fum , it was found that correlations can even cause exponential fa for smooth driving laws in a related two - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "although it is known that periodically driven quantum billiards with a discrete floquet spectrum can not exhibit fa @xcite , it is natural to complement the study of the classical dynamics of a system by analyzing its quantum behavior . while one finds many studies to the quantum version of the one - dimensional fum ( see @xcite and references therein ) , literature is very sparse on driven quantum billiards of higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite presents a method to solve the time - dependent elliptical quantum billiard .",
    "the main result was the numerical observation of resonances in the population transfer probability between instantaneous energy eigenstates .",
    "these transitions could be reproduced in an effective rabi - model and captured by a criterion stating that resonances occur whenever the difference of corresponding time - averaged energy eigenvalues matches an integer multiple of the driving frequency .",
    "however , an explanation for this criterion was not given in @xcite .    here , we develop a systematic perturbative analysis of population transfer for the system analyzed in @xcite and a generalized driving law . in this framework a fermi s golden rule @xcite",
    "is derived for elliptical quantum billiards with oscillating boundaries which explains the key observations in @xcite , i.e. the occurrence of resonant population transfer between instantaneous eigenstates and the empirical criterion relating these resonances with the spectrum of instantaneous eigenstates and the driving frequency . as a second major result",
    ", we provide a criterion to decide whether a predicted resonance can be resolved in a possible experiment of a certain duration . finally , the numerical studies in @xcite are complemented by a corresponding analysis of further driving laws .",
    "the predictions derived within our perturbative analysis will be shown to provide a perfect agreement with the numerical results in all cases .",
    "this work is structured as follows : chapter [ ch : setup ] provides a short summary of the solution of the time - dependent elliptical quantum billiard as developed in @xcite , followed by transformations that bring the schrdinger equation into a form being convenient for the application of time - dependent perturbation theory . in chapter",
    "[ ch : perturbative_analysis ] , we will calculate the transition rate between two instantaneous eigenstates per unit time is calculated in first order perturbation theory and an approximate population dynamics in the near - resonant case is derived .",
    "we find a criterion for the resolvability of predicted resonances in a possible experiment of certain duration .",
    "finally , in chapter [ ch : numerical_results ] we present and analyze numerical results for three different periodic driving laws .",
    "in the following , we first summarize our approach to a numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation of the elliptical billiard as presented in @xcite .",
    "we will transform the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) into a convenient form and finally develop a perturbative approach for the periodically driven billiard in the second part of this chapter .      a wave function @xmath0 in a driven elliptical billiard",

    "a main result of @xcite was the observation of resonant population transfer between so - called instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath33 we understand instantaneous eigenstates as follows : the semi - axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters of @xmath34 that change in time .",
    "if we evolve our system solely by @xmath34 in the se , start the system in an initial state that corresponds to an eigenstate of @xmath34 at @xmath35 and change @xmath5 and @xmath6 sufficiently slowly , then we define the instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath34 at time @xmath36 as the time - evolved wave function of the system at time @xmath36 in accordance to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "its complementary part is @xmath38 population transfer between instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath34 takes place by two different mechanisms in the billiard .",

    "@xmath34 can be rewritten in the much more convenient form @xmath42 where we call @xmath43 the mathieu operator as its eigenfunctions are just ordinary and modified mathieu functions as they appear in the solutions of the static elliptical billiard .",

    "note that we do not include @xmath79 in the unitary transformation as it is zero by definition ( [ eq : ft_diab_coupling ] ) and that @xmath80 is completely independent of @xmath67 .",

    "the discussion of concrete driving laws in chapter [ ch : numerical_results ] shows that this criterion is in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations .",

    "a rotating wave approximation simply sets all other terms in ( [ eq : ft_se_1 ] ) that do not contain this @xmath131 to zero as they are comparatively fast oscillating , such that we are left with with an effective two - level system :    @xmath135    the behavior of such a system is very well understood .",
