    "twenty years after i. i. rabi proposed its model for the description of a two - level atom interacting with a single mode of radiation field inside a qed cavity @xcite , r. h. dicke made the generalization for @xmath0 two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "shortly after their proposals , both models were approximated to simpler ( and integrable ) hamiltonians by means of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , i. e. the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) , and the tavis - cummings ( tc ) models @xcite .",
    "the dicke model has been a topic of discussion for several years , thanks to its most important trait : the prediction of the superradiant phase transition at finite temperature , which in the limit of zero temperature leads to a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite .",
    "however , along many years several authors have pointed out that this phase transition can not be achieved in a qed cavity systems due to a no - go theorem @xcite , opening an active discussion , which is far from closed @xcite .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian is composed of three terms , one describing a monochromatic quantized radiation field inside the cavity , a second one related with the relative atomic population , and a third which describes the interaction between them .",
    "it reads ( from now on we set @xmath1 ) @xmath2 here , the frequency of the radiation mode is @xmath3 , associated with the number operator @xmath4 .",
    "for the atomic part , @xmath5 is the excitation energy of the single two - level system , while @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are collective atomic pseudo - spin operators obeying the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "the @xmath6 operator quantifies the relative atomic population . besides",
    ", it holds that if @xmath9 is the eigenvalue of @xmath10 , then @xmath11 ( the pseudo - spin length ) defines the symmetric atomic subspace which includes the ground state .",
    "finally , in the case of cavity qed systems , the interaction parameter @xmath12 would depend principally in the atomic dipolar moment .",
    "as mentioned before , the most representative feature of the model is its second - order qpt in the thermodynamic limit , a paradigmatic example of quantum collective behavior .",
    "when the atom - field interaction reaches the critical value @xmath13 , its ground state goes from a normal ( @xmath14 ) , with no photons and no excited atoms , to a superradiant phase ( @xmath15 ) , where the number of photons and excited atoms becomes comparable to the total number of atoms in the system , i.e. a macroscopic population of the upper atomic level .",
    "being the simplest non - integrable atom - field system exhibiting quantum chaos , the dicke model became a paradigm in quantum optics , first , and later in the quantum information community , as it describes more generally the interaction of a set of @xmath0 two - level systems ( qubits ) interacting with a bosonic field , like quantum dots , bose - einstein condensates , and polaritons to circuit qed systems @xcite .",
    "thanks to the advance in sophisticated experimental techniques to control quantum systems , the superradiant qpt was observed experimentally in several systems during the last years . for the dicke model it was first simulated by means of a bose - einstein condensate in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "also , an open version of the model was realized employing raman transitions @xcite , and dynamical non - equilibrium superradiant phase transition has been also observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , by means of superconducting qed the rabi model @xcite and few - atoms dicke - like models @xcite have been explored in this direction .",
    "more than ten years ago , c. emary and t. brandes built approximate solutions of the dicke model by means of the holstein - primakoff realization of the su(2 ) algebra in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this approach describes the behavior of the model for the ground- and low energy - states , exhibiting the superradiant qpt easily and showing the presence of chaos in the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "besides , the truncated holstein - primakoff approach makes it possible to extract the critical exponents for the ground - state energy per particle , the fraction of excited atoms , the number of photons per atom , their fluctuations , and the concurrence @xcite .",
    "enhanced by these experimental and theoretical results , and thanks to its algebraic properties , the dicke model has become an excellent tool from the theoretical point of view for exploring several features of quantum many - body systems with collective degrees of freedom , e.g. , the qpt , the excited - state quantum phase transitions",
    "@xcite and their relation with the thermal phase transition @xcite , the onset of quantum chaos and its correspondence to the classical limit @xcite , quantum quenches @xcite and the problem of equilibrium and thermalization in isolated many - body quantum systems @xcite , to name a few .",
    "this is the motivation for looking for as many analytical or semi - analytical descriptions of the spectra and observables of the model as it is possible .",
    "the truncated holstein - primakoff approximation decouples the low energy modes into two independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is valid when the number of excitations is small compared with the number of atoms , allowing for a description of a few low energy states far from the qpt @xcite .",
    "the lack of a general analytical description is rooted in the fact that the dicke model does not have as many integrals of motion as degrees of freedom , being in this sense non - integrable , unlike the tc model .",
    "numerical calculations provide useful results in truncated subspaces @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently shown that , thanks to being restricted to the single qubit case , the rabi model can be considered as integrable @xcite , though the controversy about this fact remains @xcite .",
    "a similar method to the one which was used for the rabi model in order to show its integrability , has been recently applied to the dicke model with three @xcite and two atoms @xcite . however , a concise analytic solution of the dicke model is far to be obtained , and in the general case is quite probably impossible .    in this work",
    "we construct second integrals of motion in the dicke model employing the born - oppenheimer approximation ( boa ) @xcite .",
    "they are useful and predictive within the non - chaotic energy regime and within a wide range of values of the external parameters , coupling and frequencies , both in the normal and superradiant phases .",
    "the boa validity relies on the fact that part of the system oscillates faster than the other one , causing an effective decoupling where the slow ( adiabatically changing ) variables enters in the fast dynamics as simple parameters . as the dicke model has a one bosonic and one fermionic degree of freedom , two versions of the approximation",
    "are used , depending on which one is the faster .",
    "similar approaches have already been reported in the rabi model , the dicke model , as well as for the jc and tc modes . in the rabi model",
    "the fast atomic boa has been employed to determine the entanglement of a single atom respect the bosonic field @xcite , and to unveil previously unnoticed aspects of the rwa in the jc model @xcite . in the dicke model",
    "the fast atomic boa was applied to study its ground - state properties , like the finite size scaling of the entanglement between the components of the system and other physical observables @xcite .",
    "also , it has been used to study the finite size dependence of the tunneling driven ground - state energy splitting in the superradiant phase @xcite .",
    "the fast boson boa has been applied to the rabi model in @xcite , and then extended to develop the so called generalized rwa @xcite . also , in refs.@xcite the fast boson boa has been employed to describe the different phases that can be found in the dicke model realization in bose - einstein condensates in optical cavities @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we extend the use of the boa to higher energies in the dicke model , and show that it can describe the regular , non - chaotic energy regime of the model , which extends from the ground - state to an upper energy ( above or below the esqpt critical energy ) , depending strongly on the level splitting and the frequency of the field @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the fast boson and fast atomic boa , we explicitly derive the approximate second integral of motion that makes regular the low energy regime of the dicke model , and show its range of applicability in the model parameter space .",
    "the boa extends the theoretical tools to describe the , so far unexplained , whole non - chaotic or regular energy region of the dicke model , far beyond the region of validity of the quadratic approximation of the holstein - primakoff description .",
    "we give stringent numerical evidence showing that the boa , and the second integrals of motion coming from it , shed new light in the study of the quantum dynamics of the model .",
    "this contribution extends the study presented in ref.@xcite by some of us , where the basic idea was introduced and complementary results were given for the fast pseudospin boa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section 2 the fast pseudospin approximation and the fast boson one are presented , and their low energy frequencies are calculated .",
    "these frequencies are compared in section 3 with the exact ones to establish the region of validity of the approximations in the dicke model parameter space . in section 4",
    "we derive a semiclassical approach for the slow variables , which allows us to obtain analytic results for the expectation values of observables .",
    "these results are extensively compared in section 5 with exact results coming from the numerical diagonalization of the dicke hamiltonian . in the region of applicability",
    "the numerical results are nicely reproduced by the approximations , giving a simple framework to understand them . in section 6",
    "the adiabatic invariants associated with the two fast - slow approximations are unveiled and numerical tests are presented , showing them as approximated integrals of motion both in the semiclassical and quantum versions of the dicke model until the appearance of chaos in the energy and parameters space . in this same section ,",
    "the requantization of the semiclassical slow variable is presented and the resulting spectra are compared with the exact ones which come from numerical diagonalizations , showing again , a remarkable accord . finally in section 7",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath16 operator , defining different subspaces with fixed @xmath17 . as mentioned before",
    ", the maximum value @xmath11 designates the symmetric subspace where the ground - state lies . inside this subspace ,",
    "the hamiltonian only has two degrees of freedom , one for the collective atomic degree of freedom ( pseudospin ) and one for the bosons .",
    "an effective decoupling between them can occur as a consequence of the different temporal scales in their respective intrinsic dynamics , in two different ways .",
    "one when the pseudospin dynamics is much faster than the bosonic one , and the second in the opposite case . in the following two subsections we present the two approaches separately . to derive in a simple way the approximations , we start with a quantum - classical approach , quantum for the fast variables and classical for the slow ones . in the following sections",
    "full quantum and full classical results are presented in the framework provided by the fast - slow approximations .",
    "for the sake of clarity , let us consider the dicke hamiltonian in terms of classical boson variables , i.e. by substituting the annihilation [ creation ] operators according to @xmath18 [ @xmath19 @xmath20 if we _ freeze _",
    "the bosonic slow variables , a simple hamiltonian for the pseudospin variables is obtained , which can be easily diagonalized by considering a rotation ( @xmath21 ) around the @xmath22-axis @xmath23 the rotation angle @xmath21 can be positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "the previous hamiltonian describes the precession of the pseudospin around the rotated @xmath25 axis with angular velocity @xmath26 , and can be easily diagonalizad by considering eigenstates of the rotated operator @xmath27 @xmath28|jm'\\rangle ,   \\label{hmp}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath30 , depend on the , up to now , _ frozen _ bosonic variables . if we let these variables evolve , these eigenvalues define , for each @xmath31 , an effective hamiltonian for the slow bosonic variables , which has the standard form of a classical particle moving in a conservative potential @xmath32    we have manipulated the dicke hamiltonian to obtain two effective dynamics for the pseudospin and boson variables respectively , where the other variables enter as simple parameters .",
    "this approach will be self consistently valid only if the frequency of the precessing pseudospin @xmath33 is much larger than the frequency of the bosonic variables , @xmath34 , which evolve according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the validity of this approach is presented below .",
    "an important consequence of this approach is that the dynamics of the semi - classical model and the spectrum in the quantized version , are organized in a finite number of bands , each characterized by the quantum number @xmath31 .",
    "each band is associated to a different effective hamiltonian , @xmath36 , for the bosonic variables , and since the energy of the effective hamiltonian is only lower bounded , each band extends infinitely in energy .",
    "this band structure provides a useful description of the regular part of the energy spectra , up to a point where the approximation breaks down .    to determine the values of the fast and slow frequencies ( @xmath37 and @xmath34 ) as a function of coupling and energy , and to be able to establish the range of validity of the previous approach",
    ", we analyse the dynamics of the slow bosonic variables and focus our attention on the effective potential @xmath38 .    the minimum of the potential @xmath39 , for @xmath31 integer or half integer according to @xmath17 ,",
    "is given by @xmath40 & { \\mbox{for $ -j\\leq m'\\leq -j / f^2$}}\\\\ m'\\omega_o & { \\mbox{otherwise } } \\end{array}\\right .",

    "the colors of the points in the peres lattice indicate the uncertainty @xmath56 .",
    "observe that the lowest states of every band and all the members of the lowest band ( @xmath57 ) have very low uncertainty , which indicates that these hamiltonian eigenstates are , in some extent , also simultaneous eigenstates of operator @xmath52 .      finally , we discuss the full quantum treatment that can be performed from the fast - slow approximations . in the case of the fast pseudospin approximation , once the pseudospin part has been diagonalized by considering a rotation around the @xmath22 axis , we are left with the hamiltonian @xmath58 , eq.([hmp ] ) , for each @xmath31 .",
    "this hamiltonian can be quantized in the standard way to obtain a schrdinger equation @xmath59 or alternatively , if we are interested only in the energy spectrum , a standard bohr - sommerfeld quantization can be employed @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a closed path in the classical phase space associated to the hamiltonian @xmath36 . in any case",

    "only the lowest 20 energy states are plotted .",
    "the five states with higher energies look broken because they have avoiding crossing with other higher states not shown .",
    "the approximate results reproduce remarkably well the exact spectrum , except in the critical esqpt energy region of the superradiant phase , where the tunneling effects , not considered by the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , become relevant . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "results using the same approach are given and it is shown that the approximate and exact spectrum get closer as the number of two - level systems @xmath17 increases .    for the fast - boson approach , the procedure is similar , after diagonalizing the fast boson variable by using the shift transformation , we are left , for every quantum number @xmath64 , with an effective hamiltonian for the pseudospin variables ( [ hnp ] ) . by considering the pseudospin components as @xmath65 quantum operators , the resulting hamiltonian is a particular version of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model that can be numerically diagonalized , giving the spectrum associated to band @xmath64 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same lmg model is obtained for each band @xmath64 , and the only difference between the bands spectra is an additive simple constant @xmath66 .",
    "but for @xmath54 with @xmath67 , and the approximate results are obtained from the fast boson approximation.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig.[fig:15 ] we compare the approximate spectrum obtained from the previous approach with the exact one obtained numerically , we use a ratio @xmath54 and couplings from @xmath68 until @xmath69 .",
    "similar to the fast pseudospin case , the agreement is very good .",
    "a complete survey of the born - oppenheimer approximation ( boa ) applied to the dicke model has been presented .",
    "the study includes both the case when the fast variable is the pseudospin one and the case when the fast variable is the bosonic one .",
    "the ranges of validity of both versions of the boa were unveiled .",
    "it was found that in the normal phase a simple criterion is @xmath70 for the fast boson boa and @xmath71 for the fast pseudospin one , but in the superradiant phase , as a consequence of the change in the fundamental effective excitations , the criterion changes to @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the fast boson and fast pseudospin boa s respectively ( @xmath74 with @xmath75 ) .",
    "more restrictive and detailed criteria were obtained by comparing the low energy frequencies coming from the boa s with those obtained from a quadratic approximation around the minimal energy configuration .",
    "ample numerical tests were presented to show the effectiveness of these criteria and the ability of the boa s to reproduce the exact results of the dicke model , both in its classical and quantum version .",
    "it was found that in the boa s reproduce very well the exact results in the normal and superradiant phase , from the ground state until the energy where chaos appears in the model .",
    "the approximations explain in a clear way the appearance of independent energy bands in the regular part of the spectrum in a wide region of the model parameter space .",
    "quantitative discrepancies are found , but they are reduced for larger ratios @xmath76 in the case of the fast boson boa and @xmath77 in the case of the fast pseudospin one .",
    "the adiabatic invariants associated to the two different boa s were explicitly identified and they were found to give very approximate hamiltonian commuting operators in the quantum version of the model and very approximate conserved quantities in its classical one .",
    "our results show that the boa is very efficient to explore and explain the phenomenology observed in the regular regime of the dicke model , up to energies where chaos appears and no other approximation known so far is valid .",
    "besides the understanding of the spectrum in a wide region above the ground - state , these results provide a valuable tool to study dynamics in the dicke model .",
    "in particular , we expect that the second adiabatic invariant determines the non - equilibrium dynamics and the further thermalization after a quench , leading the system to a generalized gibbs ensemble , instead of a standard gibbs ensemble , within the region in which either the fast boson or the fast pseudospin approximation is valid .",
    "also , as we have foreseen in this work , the properties of the esqpts in this model are delimited by the existence ( or not ) of the second adiabatic invariant . within the region",
    "in which the boa is valid , the critical behavior is the corresponding to a system of just one degree of freedom , showing a logarithmic divergence in the density of states .",
    "it is worth to note that the same kind of critical behavior has been recently reported in the rabi model , in the limit in which the atomic frequency is much larger than the frequency of the field @xcite , that is , in a region in which the fast pseudospin approximation is expected to hold .",
