    "a hypersurface in the lorentz - minkowski space @xmath4 is said to be spacelike if its induced metric is a riemannian one .",
    "we can endow a spacelike hypersurface in @xmath4 with another riemannian metric , the one inherited from the euclidean space @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we can consider two different mean curvature functions on a spacelike hypersurface , the mean curvature function related to the metric induced by @xmath5 , that we will denote by @xmath6 , and the one related to the metric inherited from @xmath4 , @xmath7 .",
    "a hypersurface in @xmath5 is said to be minimal if its mean curvature function vanishes identically , that is @xmath8 .",
    "analogously , a spacelike hypersurface in @xmath4 is said to be maximal if @xmath9 .",
    "this terminology comes from the fact that minimal ( maximal ) hypersurfaces locally minimize ( maximize ) area among all nearby hypersurfaces sharing the same boundary , see @xcite .",
    "the study of minimal and maximal hypersurfaces is a topic of wide interest .",
    "one of the main results about the global geometry of minimal surfaces is the well - known bernstein theorem , proved by bernstein  @xcite in 1915 , which states that the only entire minimal graphs in @xmath1 are the planes .",
    "some decades later , in 1970 , calabi  @xcite proved its analogous version for spacelike surfaces in the lorentz - minkowski space , the calabi - bernstein theorem , which states that the only entire maximal graphs in @xmath0 are the spacelike planes .",
    "an important difference between both results is that the bernstein theorem can be extended to minimal graphs in @xmath5 up to dimension @xmath10 , but it is no longer true for bigger dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , the calabi - bernstein theorem holds true for any dimension as it was proved by calabi  @xcite for dimension @xmath11 , and by cheng and yau  @xcite for arbitrary dimension .",
    "it is interesting to note that any complete spacelike hypersurface in @xmath4 is necessarily an entire graph over any spacelike hyperplane , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) .",
    "therefore , the calabi - bernstein theorem can also be expressed in a parametric way by asserting that the only complete maximal hypersurfaces in @xmath4 are the spacelike hyperplanes .",
    "this parametric version is not true in @xmath5 , indeed there exists a wide family of examples of non - trivial complete minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath5 .    as an immediate consequence of the above results , we conclude that the only complete hypersurfaces that are simultaneously minimal in @xmath5 and maximal in @xmath4 are the spacelike hyperplanes .",
    "going a step further , we can consider spacelike hypersurfaces with the same constant mean curvature functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "heinz  @xcite , chern  @xcite and flanders  @xcite proved that the only entire graphs with constant mean curvature @xmath6 in @xmath5 are the minimal graphs .",
    "there are examples of entire spacelike graphs with constant mean curvature @xmath7 in @xmath4 which are not maximal , for instance the hyperbolic spaces .",
    "however , taking into account the calabi - bernstein theorem , we conclude again that the only complete spacelike hypersurfaces in @xmath4 with the same constant mean curvature functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spacelike hyperplanes .    without assuming any completeness hypothesis ,",
    "kobayashi  @xcite studied the problem for @xmath12 in the @xmath13-dimensional case .",
    "he showed that the only surfaces that are simultaneously minimal and maximal are open pieces of a spacelike plane or of a helicoid in the region where the helicoid is spacelike .",
    "however , nothing is known neither for bigger dimension nor for more general mean curvature functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our purpose is to study some local and global geometric properties of the spacelike surfaces in @xmath0 such that @xmath3 , not necessarily constant .",
    "although we will focus on dimension 2 , some results are still true in arbitrary dimension .",
    "it is well known that any spacelike surface can be locally seen as a graph over an open domain of a spacelike plane , which without loss of generality can be supposed to be the plane @xmath2 , see @xcite .",
    "that is , a spacelike surface is locally defined by a smooth function @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be written in terms of such a function @xmath14 and its partial derivatives . in this way",
    ", the identity @xmath3 becomes a quasilinear elliptic partial differential equation , everywhere except at those points at which the euclidean gradient of @xmath14 vanishes , where the equation is parabolic .    in section  [ prelim ]",
    "we present some basic preliminaries on spacelike hypersurfaces in @xmath4 and their mean curvature functions with respect to the metrics inherited from @xmath5 and @xmath4 . in the next section we state a result on the existence of an elliptic point in a hypersurface of @xmath5 under some appropriate assumptions , and we see that the same result holds for spacelike hypersurfaces in @xmath4 .",
    "in section  [ nonconvex ] we consider spacelike surfaces in @xmath0 such that @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that for those surfaces @xmath15 is always non - positive , and if the mean curvature does not vanish at a point , then the surface is locally non - convex at that point , * theorem  [ thm : nonconvex]*. from this theorem , as well as from the result on the existence of an elliptic point , we get some consequences to which the rest of the section is devoted . specifically , we prove the following theorems .    * theorem  [ cor : convexhull ] .",

    "we prove the uniqueness of the dirichlet problem associated to this partial differential equation under some appropriate boundary conditions , * theorem  [ cor : dirichlet2]*. this is not trivial , since the equation is not always elliptic .",

    "the mean curvature function of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath31 is defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , stand for the principal curvatures of @xmath39 .",
    "it is well known that there exists no closed ( compact and without boundary ) spacelike hypersurface in @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "therefore , every compact spacelike hypersurface @xmath16 in the lorentz - minkowski space necessarily has non - empty boundary .",
    "the same topological hypersurface can also be considered as a hypersurface of the euclidean space , that is @xmath5 with its usual euclidean metric . for simplicity",
    ", we will just denote the euclidean space by @xmath5 , the euclidean metric and the induced metric on @xmath16 by @xmath40 , and its norm by @xmath41 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath16 admits a unique upwards directed unit normal vector field , @xmath42 . in an analogous way as in the lorentzian case , let @xmath43 denote the levi - civita connection in @xmath16 with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "the gauss and weingarten formulae read now @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , @xmath46 being the shape operator of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath42 .",

    "as a first result , let us see that every compact hypersurface @xmath16 in @xmath5 with non - empty boundary , @xmath72 , and such that it is not contained in the convex hull of @xmath72 , necessarily has an elliptic point , that is , a point at which all the principal curvatures have the same sign .",
    "the proof of this result follows the ideas of the proof of the classical result on the existence of an elliptic point in a compact surface without boundary in @xmath1 .",
    "this idea was also used by the authors jointly with lpez in  @xcite to prove the existence of an elliptic point in a non - planar compact spacelike surface in @xmath0 with planar boundary .",
