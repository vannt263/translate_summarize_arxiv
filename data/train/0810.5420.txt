    "quantum entanglement is highly relevant to the fundamental issues of quantum mechanics and plays a central role in the application of quantum information science . in recent years",
    ", the practical schemes for the creation of quantum entanglement have gained significant improvements both in theoretical research and in experimental realization .",
    "one of the most popular schemes involves a couple of spontaneously emitting two - level atoms ( qubits ) trapped in a single - mode cavity @xcite , which describes both atoms or ions trapped in an electromagnetic cavity and circuit - qed setups .",
    "the corresponding investigations reach notable results on the dynamical evolution of the bipartite entanglement @xcite and the steady states of the composite two - atom system @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies base on an essential assumption that the coupling strengths of the two atoms to the cavity mode are equal @xcite , which is a good approximation for the atoms in microwave cavity .",
    "however , in optical cavity , the two atoms usually no longer possess the equivalent coupling strengths to the cavity mode @xcite . in @xcite , the case of different coupling constant",
    "is considered , but the dipole - dipole interaction is neglected in the very beginning , as in @xcite .    in this paper , we study the two two - level dipole - dipole interacting atoms in an optical cavity via a nonperturbative method @xcite , and focus on the asymptotic and transient entanglement dynamics of the composite two - atom system .    for stationary entanglement ,",
    "when the dipole - dipole interaction exists and the coupling strengths of the two atoms to the cavity mode are different , the final state of the two - atom system will become completely separable and the bipartite entanglement will collapse to zero , which indicates that there is no decoherence - free subspace in this case @xcite .",
    "this result holds under both the makovian and non - markovian treatment .",
    "thus , we conclude that the memory effect resulted from the finite correlation time of the reservoir in non - markovnian limit does not influence the asymptotic bipartite entanglement .",
    "it is shown further , for transient entanglement , that strong dipole - dipole interaction can suppress the decoherence and disentanglement . however , when the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction and coupling strength of the atoms to the environment , which determines the memory effect , are in the same magnitude order , the dipole - dipole interaction accelerates the decoherence and disentanglement for some initial states .    finally , by transforming the true mode hamiltonian which is used at the start @xcite to the quasimode hamiltonian @xcite which separates the memory effect and the damping effect of the reservoir explicitly",
    ", we present a concrete physical interpretation for all the results derived in this paper .",
    "consider two two - level atoms with a common zero - temperature bosonic reservoir , and take their dipole - dipole interaction into account from the very beginning . under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the composite two - atom system plus the reservoir is given by ( @xmath0 ) @xcite : @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4    now , we use the true mode hamiltonian . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the @xmath7th qubit ( @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode of the reservoir .",
    "the mode index @xmath11 contains several variables which are two orthogonal polarization indexes and the propagation vector @xmath12 . to measure the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity mode determined by the atom s relative position in the cavity",
    ", we introduce the dimensionless constant @xmath13 @xcite .",

    ", we consider the case in which the two atoms have the same frequency , i.e. , @xmath23 . according to the schr@xmath24dinger s equation ,",
    "the equations for the probability amplitudes take the form @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27g^ * ( \\omega _ k ) e^{i(\\omega _ k   - \\omega _ 0 ) t } .\\ ] ]    eliminating the coefficients @xmath28 by integrating eq .",

    "consider function @xmath53 each having a single simple pole @xmath54 lying on the imaginary axis , and all other poles lying in the left - hand half plane .",
    "the residue at @xmath54 is @xmath55 the other residues are of the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a constant determined by @xmath50 .",
    "since each @xmath50 has a negative real part , the residue decays exponentially in magnitude as @xmath58 increases .",
    "so , whether the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are zero as @xmath61 depends on wether eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) has a pure imaginary solution .",
    "hence , it is easy to figure out that the conditions for the existence of the steady state are @xmath62 which means unless there is no dipole - dipole interaction or the coupling strengths of the two atoms to the cavity mode are equal , @xmath63 and @xmath64 will tend to be zero as @xmath65 .    in the @xmath66 basis ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of the two atoms is given by : @xmath67 we choose the concurrence @xmath68 @xcite to measure the entanglement of the two atoms . according to the definition",
    ", the expression of the concurrence of @xmath69 is given by @xcite : @xmath70    first , consider @xmath71 , that is , the coupling constants of the two atoms to the cavity mode are the same . the asymptotic entanglement evaluated by the concurrence",
    "is given by : @xmath72 this indicates that stationary entanglement is only determined by the initial state of the system .",
    "next , consider @xmath73 , that is , the dipole - dipole interaction is neglected .",
    "the asymptotic entanglement is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "this indicates that the entanglement is determined by the initial state and the ratio of the coupling constants of the two atoms to the cavity mode .",
    "this situation has been discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "_ dynamical analysis_.in this part , we will focus on the entanglement dynamical evolution of the composite system in a good cavity , i.e. , for @xmath76 with @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the concurrence as a function of @xmath78 in the good cavity limit .",
    "we compare the dynamics of two maximally entangled states ( mes : @xmath79 ) for four different values of relative strengths of dipole - dipole interaction , namely , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 which represents the ratio of the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction to the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity field .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are as follows : @xmath84",
    "we choose the coupling parameter @xmath85 as @xmath86 , which is a typical constant in our case .",
    "other values of @xmath85 which exclude @xmath87 show qualitatively similar behavior . here",
    ", we note that when @xmath88 , @xmath89 spans an eigenspace of the hamiltonian of the composite system with and without dipole - dipole interaction , which means that once the initial state is @xmath89 , both the population and concurrence will stay at their maximal value 1 as time increases irrespective of what the relative strength @xmath90 is .    for a mes @xmath91 , and for the case of @xmath92 ,",
    "the population and concurrence oscillate at the very beginning , but as time increases the composite two - atom system collapses to a steady state , which means that the black plots for both the population and concurrence will converge to a straight line with a fixed value as @xmath93 increases .",
    "however , when we take into account the dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath94 ) with @xmath95 , both the population and concurrence perform damped oscillations and tend to be zero inevitably as time increases which means that the composite system has no steady state and will lose their bipartite entanglement completely just as our asymptotic analysis describes .",
    "when @xmath96 , the entanglement collapses faster with the growing strength of the dipole - dipole interaction . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath97 , the entanglement collapses more slowly with the increasing strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the fastest disentanglement happens when the strength of dipole - dipole interaction and the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity field are in the same order of magnitude ( @xmath98 ) , given all other conditions the same , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "whereas , for a mes @xmath99 , the disentanglement becomes slower as the dipole - dipole interaction become stronger , which means the dipole - dipole interaction can inhibit decoherence and disentanglement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) . in the practical engineering of entanglement ,",
    "this result suggest that if it is hard to gain equal couplings between the atoms to the cavity , one can simply choose an appropriate distance to make the couplings of the atoms to the cavity to be much smaller or bigger than the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "this will , at least , keep the entanglement alive for a longer time .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we choose @xmath100 , which can be well realized within the current experimental condition @xcite",
    ". a more intuitive impression of the role of the dipole - dipole interaction can be get from fig .",
    "the explanations of these results will be given in details in the following section .",
    "in order to erect a concrete explanation for these phenomena , we convert the true mode hamiltonian with lorentz spectral density into the quasimode form , because in the truemode hamiltonian , the coupling between the atoms and infinite modes makes it hard to separate the damping effect and the memory effect . using the method in @xcite , we get : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103,\\ ] ] @xmath104},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 are the creation and annihilation operators of the continuum quasimode of frequency @xmath106 , @xmath107 and the other parameters are the same as before .    from the above hamiltonian , the composite two - atom system only interacts with one discrete mode and their coupling coefficients are just the transition strength @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the discrete mode interacts with a set of continuum modes @xcite and their coupling strength only contains the width of the lorentzian spectral density @xmath110 which is a constant .",
    "this means that if we let the two atoms and the discrete mode be a new system and the continuum modes be the reservoir , the behavior of the new system is exactly markovian .",
    "the physical interpretation of the quasimode hamiltonian has been discussed in details in @xcite , and more details about the relations between the quasimode and the true mode hamiltonian are given in the appendix .",
    "now we use the quasimode hamiltonian to explain the results derived above .",
    "the first thing is the origin of the non - markovian memory effect",
    ". as we know , the memory effect originates from the finite lifetime of the photon in the cavity @xcite . according to eqs .",
    "( 26)-(29 ) , the atoms only interact with the discrete mode , while the irreversible process only happens in the interaction between the discrete mode and the continuum modes .",
    "so , the reabsorbing phenomenon that causes the entanglement to oscillate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , just results from the interaction between the atoms and the discrete mode , which is a reversible process .",
    "yet , due to the coupling between the discrete and the continuum modes , the photon escapes into the continuum modes and never comes back , for the process is exactly markovian .",
    "this means that the memory effect is a finite time phenomenon , which fits the results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the oscillating phenomenon is only obvious at the very beginning .",
    "the second thing is the disentanglement suppressing effect in the strong dipole - dipole interaction . from eqs .",
    "( 26)-(29 ) , we can see that the atoms are only coupled to the discrete mode , while the damping process only happens between the discrete and the continuum modes .",
    "this indicates that if the exciton only exists in the atoms , the damping process does not happen .",
    "the damping of the atoms happens only when the exciton in the atomic system is transferred to the discrete mode by the interaction between them and then photon escapes to the continuum modes before it comes back to the atomic system again .",
    "that is to say , the probability of the exciton transferring from the atom to the discrete mode is related to the disentanglement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , if the dipole - dipole interaction is much stronger than the interaction between the atom and the discrete quasimode , the disentanglement happens very slowly .",
    "so , in terms of quantum perturbation theory , the dynamics of the atoms is mainly determined by @xmath107 .",
    "because the initial state @xmath91 form an invariant subspace of @xmath107 , the atoms will stay in this state forever in the zeroth order perturbation consideration , and the disentanglement is caused only by the higher - order corrections , which are relatively small quantities .",
    "therefore , the disentanglement happens slowly .",
    "when the two strengths are in the same order of magnitude , @xmath111 is not small quantity compared to @xmath107 , and the higher - order correction can not be treated as perturbation , and thus the disentanglement happens very fast .",
    "the analogous discussion goes well also for the case of the strength of dipole - dipole interaction @xmath112 being much smaller than the strength of the interaction between the atom and the discrete quasimode @xmath113 .",
    ", for the initial state @xmath91 with @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116.,width=192 ]",
    "in this paper , we extend the study of the entanglement dynamics to a realistic situation where the dipole - dipole interaction is not neglected and the couplings of the atoms to the field are different .",
    "we find , in this situation , that there is no steady state entanglement .",
    "this result is valid for both the markovian and non - markovian environment . nevertheless ,",
    "though the dipole - dipole interaction could destroy the asymptotic entanglement , strong dipole - dipole interaction does suppress disentanglement effect under some conditions .",
