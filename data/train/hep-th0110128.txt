    "without doubt , most particles can be regarded as composite particles , such as molecules composed of atoms , atoms composed of electrons and nuclei , nuclei composed of nucleons , so on , it is important to recognize that physics must be invariant for the composite particles and their constituent particles , this requirement is called particle invariance in this paper . but",
    "difficulties arise immediately because for fermion we use dirac equation , for meson we use klein - gordon equation and for classical particle we use newtonian mechanics , while the connections between these equations are quite indirect .",
    "thus if the particle invariance is held in physics , i.e. , only one physical formalism exists for any particle , we can expect to find out the differences between these equations by employing the particle invariance . using this approach",
    "is one of the goals of this paper , consequently , several new relationships between them are found , the most important result is that the obstacles that cluttered the path from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics are found , it becomes possible to derive the quantum wave equations from relativistic mechanics after the obstacles are removed .",
    "another goal is just to discuss interactions between particles under the particle invariance , several new formulae of interactions are derived and discussed .",
    "the new results provide an insight into improving quark model .",
    "fermions satisfy fermi - dirac statistics , bosons satisfy bose - einstein statistics , there is a connection between the spin of a particle and the statistics .",
    "it is clear that the spin is a key concept for particle physics . in this section",
    "we shall show that the spin of a particle is one of the consequences of the particle invariance .    according to newtonian mechanics , in a hydrogen atom",
    ", the single electron revolves in an orbit about the nucleus , its motion can be described by its position in an inertial cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 . as the time elapses",
    ", the electron draws a spiral path ( or orbit ) , as shown in fig.[dfig1](a ) in imagination .        if the reference frame @xmath1  rotates  through an angle about the @xmath2-axis in fig.[dfig1](a ) , becomes a new reference frame @xmath3 ( there will be a lorentz transformation linking the frames @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) , then in the frame @xmath3 , the spiral path of the electron tilts with respect to the @xmath4-axis with the angle as shown in fig.[dfig1](b ) . at one instant of time , for example , @xmath5 instant ,",
    "the spiral path pierces many points at the plane @xmath5 , for example , the points labeled @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in fig.[dfig1](b ) , these points indicate that the electron can appear at many points at the time @xmath9 , in agreement with the concept of probability in quantum mechanics .",
    "this situation gives us a hint to approach quantum wave nature from relativistic mechanics .",
    "because the electron pierces the plane @xmath5 with 4-vector velocity @xmath10 , at every pierced point we can label a local 4-vector velocity .",
    "the pierced points may be numerous if the path winds up itself into a cell about the nucleus ( due to a nonlinear effect in a sense ) , then the 4-vector velocities at the pierced points form a 4-vector velocity field . it is noted that the observation plane selected for the piercing can be taken at an arbitrary orientation , so the 4-vector velocity field may be expressed in general as @xmath11 , i.e. the velocity @xmath10 is a function of 4-vector position .",
    "at every point in the reference frame @xmath3 the electron satisfies relativistic newton s second law of motion :    @xmath12    the notations consist with the convention@xcite .",
    "since the cartesian coordinate system is a frame of reference whose axes are orthogonal to one another , there is no distinction between covariant and contravariant components , only subscripts need be used . here and below ,",
    "summation over twice repeated indices is implied in all case , greek indices will take on the values 1,2,3,4 , and regarding the rest mass @xmath13 as a constant .",
    "as mentioned above , the 4-vector velocity @xmath10 can be regarded as a multi - variable function , then    @xmath14    @xmath15    substituting them back into eq.([1 ] ) , and re - arranging these terms , we obtain    @xmath16    using the notation    @xmath17    eq.([4 ] ) is given by    @xmath18    because @xmath19 contains the variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 which are independent from @xmath24 , then a main solution satisfying eq.([6 ] ) is given by    @xmath25    ( in this paper we do not discuss the special solutions that @xmath26 , if they exist ) . according to green s formula or stokes s theorem , the above equation allows us to introduce a potential function @xmath27 in mathematics , further set @xmath28 , we obtain a very important equation    @xmath29    where @xmath30 representing wave nature may be a complex mathematical function , its physical meanings is determined from experiments after the introduction of the planck s constant @xmath31 .    the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle is given in its square form by    @xmath32    which is valid at every point in the 4-vector velocity field .",
    "multiplying the two sides of the above equation by @xmath33 and using eq.([8 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath34   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( -i\\hbar \\partial _ \\mu -qa_\\mu ) ( -i\\hbar \\partial _ \\mu -qa_\\mu ) \\psi   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -[-i\\hbar \\psi \\partial _ \\mu ( mu_\\mu ) ]   \\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the continuity condition for the electron motion    @xmath35    we have    @xmath36    it is known as the klein - gordon equation .    on the condition of non - relativity",
    ", schrodinger equation can be derived from the klein - gordon equation @xcite(p.469 ) .",
    "however , we must admit that we are careless when we use the continuity condition eq.([11 ] ) , because , from eq.([8 ] ) we obtain    @xmath37    where we have used lorentz gauge condition .",
    "thus from eq.([9 ] ) to eq.([10 ] ) we obtain    @xmath38",
    "this is of a complete wave equation for describing the motion of the electron accurately .",
    "the klein - gordon equation is a linear wave equation so that the principle of superposition is valid , however with the addition of the last term of eq.([14 ] ) , eq.([14 ] ) turns to display chaos .    in the following",
    "we shall show dirac equation from eq.([8 ] ) and eq.([9 ] ) . from eq.([8 ] ) , the wave function can be given in integral form by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is an integral constant , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the initial and final points of the integral with an arbitrary integral path .",
    "since maxwell s equations are gauge invariant , eq.([8 ] ) should preserve invariant form under a gauge transformation specified by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is an arbitrary function .",
    "then eq.([15 ] ) under the gauge transformation is given by    @xmath45    the situation in which a wave function can be changed in a certain way without leading to any observable effects is precisely what is entailed by a symmetry or invariant principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "here we emphasize that the invariance of velocity field is held for the gauge transformation .",
    "suppose there is a family of wave functions @xmath46 which correspond to the same velocity field denoted by @xmath47 , they are distinguishable from their different phase angles @xmath40 as in eq.([15 ] ) .",
    "then eq.([9 ] ) can be given by    @xmath48    suppose there are four matrices @xmath49 which satisfy    @xmath50    then eq.([18 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath51[a_{\\mu jk}p_\\mu \\psi ^{(k)}-i\\delta _ { jk}mc\\psi ^{(k ) } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is kronecker delta function , @xmath53 . for the above equation",
    "there is a special solution given by    @xmath54\\psi ^{(k)}=0   \\label{21}\\ ] ]    there are many solutions for @xmath49 which satisfy eq.([19 ] ) , we select a set of @xmath49 as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the matrices defined in dirac algebra@xcite(p.557 ) . substituting them into eq.([21 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath58\\psi = 0   \\label{23}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is an one - column matrix about @xmath59 .",
    "then eq.([23 ] ) is just the dirac equation .",
    "the dirac equation is a linear wave equation , the principle of superposition is valid for it .",
    "let index @xmath60 denote velocity field , then @xmath61 , whose four component functions correspond to the same velocity field @xmath60 , may be regarded as the eigenfunction of the velocity field @xmath60 ( it may be different from the eigenfunction of energy ) . because the velocity field is an observable in a physical system , in quantum mechanics we know ,",
    "@xmath62 constitute a complete basis in which arbitrary function @xmath63 can be expanded in terms of them    @xmath64    obviously , @xmath63 satisfies eq.([23 ] ) .",
    "then eq.([23 ] ) is just the dirac equation suitable for composite wave function .",
    "alternatively , another method to show the dirac equation is more traditional : at first , we show the dirac equation of free particle by employing plane waves , we easily obtain eq.([23 ] ) on the condition of @xmath65 ; next , adding electromagnetic field , the plane waves are still valid in any finite small volume with the momentum of eq.([8 ] ) when we regard the field to be uniform in the volume , so the dirac equation eq.([23 ] ) is valid in the volume even if @xmath66 , the plane waves constitute a complete basis in the volume ; third , the finite small volume can be chosen to locate at anywhere , then anywhere have the same complete basis , therefore the dirac equation eq.([23 ] ) is valid at anywhere .",
    "of course , on the condition of non - relativity , schrodinger equation can be derived from the dirac equation @xcite(p.479 ) .    by further calculation",
    ", the dirac equation can arrive at klein - gordon equation with an additional term which represents the effect of spin , this term is just the last term of eq.([14 ] ) approximately .",
    "but , do not forget that the dirac equation is a special solution of eq.([20 ] ) , therefore we believe there are some quantum effects beyond the dirac equation . with this consequence , it is easy to understand why some problems of quantum electrodynamics can not been completely explained by the dirac equation",
    ".    eq.([20 ] ) originates from the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle , the formula is suitable for any particle , so it satisfies the particle invariance .",
    "the dirac equation is regarded as an approximation to eq.([20 ] ) , the approximation brings out many troubles with the spin concept . from the dirac equation",
    "we can predict that a composite particle and an its constituent both have their own spins , but this prediction is not true for mesons because pion has zero spin while its constituent quark has 1/2 spin , in other words , due to the approximation the dirac equation does not involve some states such as zero spin state .",
    "that is why we want to classify particles into fermions and mesons by spin and use different equations . if we can find a precise solution of eq.([20 ] ) instead of the dirac equation , then the classification is not necessary .",
    "it is noted that eq.([20 ] ) is nonlinear while the dirac equation is linear , this reminders us that we can never find any precise solutions in a linear equation which satisfy eq.([20 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for this problem , a good solution depends on how much precision we can reach for our requirement .    in one hand",
    ", it is rather remarkable that klein - gordon equation and dirac equation can be derived from relativistic newton s second law of motion approximately , in another hand , all particles , such as fermions , bosons and classical particles , satisfy the relativistic newton s second law ( it will be further clear later ) , thus it is a natural choice that only the relativistic newton s second law is independent and necessary .",
    "only one formalism is necessary for any particle , this is just the particle invariance , we arrive at the aim .    as mentioned above , the spin is one feature hidden in the relativistic newton s second law , but more features will turn out from the relativistic newton s second law in the following sections .",
    "in this section we discuss how to determine the planck s constant that emerges in the preceding section .    in 1900",
    ", m. planck assumed that the energy of a harmornic oscilator can take on only discrete values which are integral multiples of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the vibration frequency and @xmath69 is a fundamental constant , now either @xmath69 or @xmath70 is called as planck s constant .",
    "the planck s constant next made its appearance in 1905 , when einstein used it to explain the photoelectric effect , he assumed that the energy in an electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath71 is in the form of discrete quanta ( photons ) each of which has an energy @xmath72 in accordance with planck s assumption . from then , it has been recognized that the planck s constant plays a key role in quantum mechanics .    according to the previous section",
    ", no mater how to move or when to move in minkowski s space , the motion of a particle is governed by a potential function @xmath27  as    @xmath73    for applying eq.([p1 ] ) to specific applications , without loss of generality , we set @xmath74 , then eq.([p1 ] ) is rewritten as    @xmath75    the coefficient @xmath76  is subject to the interpretation of @xmath30 .",
    "there are three mathematical properties of @xmath30 worth recording here .",
    "first , if there is a path @xmath77 joining initial point @xmath41 to final point @xmath78 , then    @xmath79    second , the integral of eq.([p3 ] ) is independent from the choice of path .",
    "third , the superposition principle is valid for @xmath80 , i.e. , if there are @xmath81 paths from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , then    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the average momentum .    to gain further insight into physical meanings of this equations ,",
    "we shall discuss two applications .      as shown in fig.[pfig1 ] , suppose that the electron gun emits a burst of electrons at @xmath41 at time @xmath86 , the electrons arrive at the point @xmath42 on the screen at time @xmath87 .",
    "there are two paths for the electron to go to the destination , according to our above statement , @xmath30 is given by        @xmath88    where we use @xmath89 and @xmath90 to denote the paths @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "multiplying eq.([p7 ] ) by its complex conjugate gives    @xmath93   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 + 2\\cos [ \\frac p\\kappa ( l_1-l_2 ) ]   \\label{p8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is the momentum of the electron .",
    "we find a typical interference pattern with constructive interference when @xmath95 is an integral multiple of @xmath96 , and destructive interference when it is a half integral multiple .",
    "this kind of experiments has been done since a long time age , no mater what kind of particle , the comparison of the experiments to eq.([p8 ] ) leads to two consequences : ( 1 ) the complex function @xmath30 is found to be probability amplitude , i.e. , @xmath97 expresses the probability of finding a particle at location @xmath42 in the minkowski s space .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath76 is the planck s constant .",
    "the integral of time component in the above calculation has been autimatically canceled because the experimental pattern is stable .",
    "let us consider the modification of the two slit experiment , as shown in fig.[pfig2 ] . between the two slits there",
    "is located a tiny solenoid s , designed so that a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the figure can be produced in its interior .",
    "no magnetic field is allowed outside the solenoid , and the walls of the solenoid are such that no electron can penetrate to the interior .",
    "like eq.([p7 ] ) , the amplitude @xmath30 is given by    @xmath98    and the probability is given by    @xmath99   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 + 2\\cos [ \\frac p\\kappa ( l_1-l_2)+\\frac 1\\kappa \\oint_{(l_1+\\overline{l_2}% ) } qa_\\mu dx_\\mu ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 + 2\\cos [ \\frac p\\kappa ( l_1-l_2)+\\frac{q\\phi } \\kappa ]   \\label{p10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 denotes the inverse path to the path @xmath90 , @xmath101 is the magnetic flux that passes through the surface between the paths @xmath89 and @xmath100 , and it is just the flux inside the solenoid .        now , constructive ( or destructive ) interference occurs when    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is an integer . when @xmath76 takes the value of the planck s constant , we know that this effect is just the aharonov - bohm effect which was shown experimentally in 1960 .",
    "in this section we shall correct a mistake about coulomb s force and gravitational force in physical education , which cluttered the path from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics .",
    "we also shall discuss maxwell s equations in detail .    in the world",
    ", almost every young person was educated to know that the coulomb s force and gravitational force act along the line joining a couple of particles , but this knowledge is incorrect in the theory of relativity .    in relativity theory ,",
    "the 4-vector velocity @xmath10 of a particle has components @xmath104 , the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity @xmath10 is given by    @xmath105    the above equation is valid so that any force can never change @xmath10 in the magnitude but can change @xmath10 in the direction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the coulomb s force and gravitational force on a particle always act in the direction orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle in the 4-dimensional space - time , rather than along the line joining a couple of particles .",
    "alternatively , any 4-vector force @xmath106 satisfy the following perpendicular or orthogonal relation    @xmath107    this simple inference clearly tells us that the forces are not centripetal or centrifugal forces about their sources , even if in 3-dimensional space [ see eq.([e7 ] ) ] , this character provides a internal reason for accounting for the quantum behavior of particle or chaos .",
    "thus the derivations in terms of 4-vector velocity field in the preceding section become reasonable .    in the present paper , eq.([e02 ] )",
    "has been elevated to an essential requirement for definition of force , which brings out many new aspects for coulomb s force and gravitational force .",
    "we assume that coulomb s law remains valid only for two particles both at rest in usual 3-dimensional space .",
    "suppose there are two charged particle @xmath108 and @xmath109 locating at positions @xmath42 and @xmath110 in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath1 and moving at 4-vector velocities @xmath10 and @xmath111 respectively , as shown in fig.[afig1 ] , where we use @xmath112 to denote @xmath113 .",
    "the coulomb s force @xmath106 acting on particle @xmath108 is perpendicular ( orthogonal ) to the velocity direction of @xmath108 , as illustrated in fig.[afig1 ] , like a centripetal force , the force @xmath106 should make an attempt to rotate itself about its path center , the center may locate at the front or back of the particle @xmath109 , so the force @xmath106 should lie in the plane of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , then    @xmath114    where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are unknown coefficients , the possibility of this expansion will be further clear in the next subsection in where the expansion is not an assumption [ see eq.([g3 ] ) ] . using the relation @xmath117 , we get    @xmath118    we rewrite eq.([e1 ] ) as    @xmath119   \\label{e3}\\ ] ]    it follows from the direction of eq.([e3 ] ) that the unit vector of the coulomb s force direction is given by    @xmath120 \\label{e4}\\ ] ]    because    @xmath121   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac 1{c^2r}[(u\\cdot r)u^{\\prime } -(u\\cdot u^{\\prime } ) r ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -[(\\widehat{u}\\cdot \\widehat{r})\\widehat{u}^{\\prime } -(\\widehat{u}\\cdot   \\widehat{u}^{\\prime } ) \\widehat{r } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\widehat{u}^{\\prime } \\cosh \\alpha + \\widehat{r}\\sinh \\alpha   \\label{e5a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath122    where @xmath123 refers to the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",

    "the above formalism clearly shows that maxwell s equations can be derived from the classical coulomb s force and the perpendicular ( orthogonal ) relation of force and velocity . in other words ,",
    "the perpendicular relation is hidden in maxwell s equation .",

    "the above formalism has a significance on guiding how to develope the theory of gravity . in analogy with the modified coulomb s force of eq.([e7 ] ) , we directly suggest a modified universal gravitational force as    @xmath144   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{gmm^{\\prime } } { c^2r^3}[(u\\cdot r)u^{\\prime } -(u\\cdot u^{\\prime } ) r ] \\label{g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a couple of particles with masses @xmath13 and @xmath145 respectively .",

    "consequence 3 : when two bodies are seperated from an infinite distance , the interaction between them must vanish .",
    "otherwise , no body can be at rest , bacause a rest body will always be affected by the motion of a far distance body , whereas the far distance bodies are innumerable as a background .",
    "now we go back to consider the whole system composed of bob and alics , without loss of generality , suppose that the center is at rest at the origin of the frame of reference , then the center has a 4-vector velocity @xmath166 , the  at rest  refers to being at rest in usual 3-dimensional space . from eq.([r4 ] ) , the quantity @xmath106 must be orthogonal with the 4-vector velocity @xmath10 of bob , likewise for alice , we have    @xmath167    they set up a rule for the interaction between bob and alice in the composite system .",

    "a complete inner product space is called a hilbert space .",
    "our experience in the preceding sections tells us that it is an easy thing to put dynamics into the hilbert space if we have an invariant quantity .",
    "the formalism of the interaction can be derived from some basic laws , it is strongly based on concrete instances .",

    "the newton s first law of motion becomes a sort of strong constraint , inevitably leads to action reaction law or momentum conversation law being valid inside the system , for example , for a rest system composed of two dollons alice and bob we have    @xmath303    the above equation means that the action and reaction are equal in magnitude and reverse in directions on the line joining the two particle .",
    "but we immediately wonder at that alice and bob have to adjust their proper times @xmath304 and @xmath305 from time to time to meet the requirement of eq.([d2 ] ) .",

    "the new explanation seems to be much reasonable , but it is worth further studying the action reaction law and momentum conversation law which are confronting with serious troubles , they need special treatment like that for ampere s force in electromagnetism .    another topic we would like to discuss briefly is su(n ) group .",
    "each infinitesimal transformation of the su(n ) group can be written in the form    @xmath312    as usual , repeated indices must be summed over . where the real parameter @xmath313 are treated as small quantities , @xmath314 and @xmath315 are matrices which satisfy the definition of the group    @xmath316    we recall from eq.([20 ] ) that dirac equation was derived from the following equation    @xmath317[a_{\\mu jk}p_\\mu \\psi ^{(k)}-i\\delta _ { jk}mc\\psi ^{(k)}]=0   \\label{d9}\\ ] ]    it is much impressive that eq.([d8 ] ) and eq.([d9 ] ) have a similar form , especially when we let a matrix @xmath318 to absorb the right side of eq.([d8 ] ) , i.e.    @xmath319    from this comparison we may understand why the su(n ) group could embed in quantum mechanics in a obscure way .",
    "this situation arouses our interest to measure a new group whose matrices satisfy    @xmath320    we believe this new group has even more direct relations with quantum mechanics .",
    "it is important to recognize that physics must be invariant for composite particles and their constituent particles , only one physical formalism exists for any particle , this requirement is called particle invariance .    under the particle invariance , it is rather remarkable to find that klein - gordon equation and dirac equation can be derived from the relativistic newton s second law of motion on different conditions respectively , thus only one formalism is necessary for particle , the relativistic newton s second law is regarded as one which suitable for any kinds of particles .",
    "we point out that the coulomb s force and gravitational force on a particle always act in the direction orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle in 4-dimensional space - time , rather than along the line joining a couple of particles .",
    "this inference is obviously supported from the fact that the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity is kept constant .",
    "maxwell s equations can be derived from classical coulomb s force and the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle .    our speculation on the quarks model leads to introduce a new elementary particle called dollon to assemble particles such as baryons , mesons and other composite particles . instead of quark model ,",
    "the dollon model is better in organizing known data , specially in modelling interactions .",
    "it is found that relativistic newton s second law and various interactions can be derived from the newton s first law of motion and the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle .",
    "the structure of minkowski s space is discussed in detail , it indicates that the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle is only a geometrical distance formula ( pythagoras s theorem ) , so that it is completely free from any particle property . any dynamics or dynamical characteristics originated from the magnitude formula of 4-vector velocity of particle",
