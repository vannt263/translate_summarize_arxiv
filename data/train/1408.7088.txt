    "keystone in the study of statistical physics problems , numerical methods are generally expected to fulfil two requirements : ( i ) first ( and surely the most important ) , to yield precise estimates for the thermodynamical quantities analyzed ; ( ii ) second , to be as simple and as fast as possible in their implementations .",
    "nevertheless , often the mentioned two requisites strike out in opposite directions . indeed , consider , e.g. , systems in the regime of phase transitions whose distinct regions of the phase space are separated by large free - energy barriers .",
    "it is a common situation not only for complex problems like spin glasses , protein folding , and biomolecules conformation @xcite , but also in lattice gas models displaying first - order phase transitions @xcite . in all such examples",
    "there may be the occurrence of metastability @xcite .",
    "thus , when simulated , these systems can get trapped into local minima .",
    "ways to circumvent this technical difficulty should demand more sophisticated evolution dynamics procedures and longer computational times .",
    "different proposals like , ( a ) cluster @xcite , ( b ) multicanonical @xcite , ( c ) wang - landau @xcite , and ( d ) tempering @xcite , among others , are relevant algorithms trying to maintain a good balance between features ( i ) and ( ii ) above . in special ,",
    "( d ) above relies on the straightforward idea of `` heating up '' the system to higher temperatures , so to help it to cross the barriers at low temperatures .",
    "moreover , tempering methods have attracted large interest due to their generality with a broad applicability @xcite .",
    "there are two major formulations for the tempering approach , namely , parallel ( pt ) @xcite and simulated ( st ) @xcite , where always the start point is to choose a set of @xmath0 distinct temperatures ( with @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 , in which @xmath3 is the one of interest . in the pt",
    ", configurations from the distinct @xmath0 replicas ( running in parallel ) at the different @xmath4 s are exchanged . for the st",
    ", a single realization undergoes many temperature changes ( among the @xmath4 s in @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , the temperature itself is a dynamical variable .",
    "each tempering implementation presents its own characteristics and advantages , as recently discussed in details in @xcite ( see also the refs . therein ) .",
    "in particular , although the st has a higher probability than the pt to exchange temperature @xcite , it displays a less frequent tunneling between coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "hence , the st requires large computational time for generating uncorrelated configuration with a slower convergence to the steady equilibrium . on the other hand , for proper estimates ( at least at first - order phase transition regimes ) the pt needs non - adjacent switch of temperatures , making the procedure a bit more involving ",
    "an implementation not necessary for the st .",
    "furthermore , for the hard to treat case of strong discontinuous phase transitions , promising extensions for tempering methods have been proposed . in particular , the pt combined with modified ensembles ( as multiple gaussians @xcite ) comprise the so called generalized replica exchange approaches @xcite .",
    "they have been applied with great success to problems like solid - liquid @xcite and vapor - liquid transitions @xcite .",
    "also , enhancement for the usual st are possible .",
    "examples are : ( a ) to consider for it modified distributions @xcite , leading to very good results for both lattice ( e.g. , potts and ising ) and continuum ( lennard - jones clusters ) models ; and ( b ) besides @xmath4 to assume another dynamical variable , as the external field @xcite , quite helpful in dealing with crossovers in 2d ising systems .    thus , it would be desirable to improve the efficiency of the st still preserving its positive aspects , notably the procedure simplicity .",
    "as a hint to do so , the previous comments indicate that a central point in the st method is less the probability of a single attempt to exchange temperatures @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) and more the overall frequency in which the different system phases are visited . therefore , one should try to optimize the set @xmath12 as a whole , investigating how the combination of the different transitions would speed up the convergence to the steady state ( by a more uniform sampling of the microscopic configurations ) .    for the st we then propose here a rather direct protocol to select @xmath12 by means of a fixed exchange frequency ( fef ) prescription .",
    "given @xmath0 , it consists in determining the @xmath5 s such that the exchange frequency between any pair of adjacent temperatures is @xmath7 . from simple preliminary tests we verify if the obtained set leads to an appropriate tunneling between coexisting phases .",
    "if this is not the case , another value of @xmath7 is chosen , a new @xmath12 is calculated , and the tests repeated . with relatively low computational effort ( see next section ) , we end up with a very efficient @xmath12 for the full simulations . through examples , we furthermore show that this optimal @xmath12 works well for other values of the considered parameters and not only for the specific values employed in the set derivation .",
    "the same @xmath12 also can be used in the vicinity of the original parameters values as well as for other system sizes .",
    "hence , in many applications @xmath12 needs to be determined just once .",
    "we compare the fef with other schemes to select the @xmath5 s .",
    "we find that the present is not only superior to more simple recipes ( like arithmetic progressions ( ap ) ) but also to more physically oriented selection methods ( like the constant entropy ( ce ) @xcite ) .",
    "we finally confirm a somehow expected result ( but not fully investigated in the literature ) that the exact distribution of temperatures in @xmath12 becomes less relevant as @xmath0 increases .    as illustrations ,",
    "we address three distinct systems , so exploiting a relatively larger variety of first - order phase transitions features .",
    "one is the potts model , an ideal case test . for large @xmath15 s",
    ", it presents strong discontinuous transitions ( the regime we shall focus ) , whose temperatures are exactly known .",
    "the others are the beg and bl models , likewise interesting not only by displaying more complex phase diagrams than the potts ( e.g. , having phases with distinct structural properties ) , but also for already being extensively analyzed through the pt and st approaches @xcite .",
    "thus , all them are nice examples to check for the reliability of the proposed protocol .    the work is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "ii we review the st approach and how to characterize first - order phase transitions at low @xmath4 s ( the context we focus in this contribution ) .",
    "we also discuss in full details the fef protocol . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the beg , bell - lavis ( bl ) , and potts lattice models .",
    "for the beg and bl we also compare the fef results with those for two other schemes ( ap and ce ) and illustrate the methods performance dependence on the number of replicas @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , we present final remarks and conclusion in sec .",
    "in general , for systems displaying first - order transitions at low temperatures or with a large jump in the order parameter @xcite , the distinct coexisting phases are separated by large free - energy barriers , exhibiting trapping and metastable states .",
    "hence , such cases are interesting instances to test the proposed scheme .",
    "so , next we first give a brief account of the st method and discuss an appropriate way to analyze strong first - order phase transitions .",
    "then , we pass to describe a fef framework for the st method .      the st follows a twofold procedure .",
    "first , at a certain @xmath5 ( and during some established number of steps ) , a standard metropolis prescription evolves a system of hamiltonian @xmath16 throughout the phase space allowed microstates @xmath17 .",
    "second , an attempt for the change @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 the system state at the attempt time step ) is drawn from @xmath22 \\}. \\label{pt - weight}\\ ] ] this scheme is repeated a number @xmath23 of times .",
    "also , we consider only adjacent exchanges , i.e. , @xmath24 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ pt - weight ] ) , the transition probability @xmath25 strongly depends on the temperatures difference .",
    "larger @xmath26 leads to lower acceptance probabilities , whereas lower @xmath26 , although enhancing the exchanges , may not be efficient since the generated configurations at @xmath27 in general will be similar to those at @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , conceivably there is a compromise between opposite factors , implying in the existence of a best set @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we comment that in some st implementations , the correct weights @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 the free energy )  whose role is to assure an uniform visit to the distinct @xmath4 s  are approximated @xcite . for our examples ,",
    "we obtain the @xmath32 s exactly by means of the approach in @xcite . in short ( full details in @xcite ) , suppose a lattice model composed of @xmath33 layers of @xmath34 sites each . the total number of sites ( or the volume ) is then @xmath35 .",
    "also , assume the full hamiltonian written in terms of these layers as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the @xmath38-th layer state configuration and @xmath39 ( periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath40 is defined in such way that its elements are @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit ( achieved already at relatively small @xmath42 s @xcite ) @xmath43/(\\beta_r l)$ ] , with @xmath44 in the above expression , the averages @xmath45 are direct calculated from usual mc simulations @xcite .      for strong first - order phase transitions",
    " our interest here  usual order parameters ( such as density and magnetization ) and even other thermodynamic quantities like energy , are very well described by expressions in the following generic functional form @xcite",
    "@xmath46)/                  ( 1 + \\sum_{n=2}^{\\mathcal{n } } c_n \\ , \\exp[-a_n y ] ) .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] for @xmath47 the control parameter , @xmath48 denotes the `` distance '' to the coexistence point @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the number of coexisting phases .",
    "the @xmath51 s are constants and the @xmath52 s are related to @xmath53 , for @xmath54 the free energy of the coexisting phase @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "only the @xmath56 s are ( linear ) functions of @xmath42 . as a remarkable consequence , by considering different system sizes , all curves @xmath57 cross at @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if a numerical approach can properly simulate a given thermodynamic quantity in a phase space region nearby the coexistence point , then simple fittings using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] )  for just few system sizes @xmath34 s  can fully determine the phase transition thermodynamic properties ( for many examples and a very detailed discussion about the usage of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , see ref .",
    "we emphasizes that for first - order phase transitions at small @xmath4 s , the above expression is a rigorous result . in this way",
    ", @xmath59 provides a very reliable test for the method . indeed , if the simulations lead to order parameters not having the shape in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , this is a strong indication of the algorithm inadequacy .",
    "so , assume a fixed @xmath34 and @xmath47 around the phase transition point @xmath49 .",
    "we can verify the protocol convergence towards the order parameter steady value as well as the tunneling between the phases as the following .",
    "appropriate sampling of the relevant regions in the phase space is achieved when the @xmath59 s fluctuate mildly around @xmath60 , with @xmath61 ( in our examples averaged over more than 100 simulations runs ) . on the contrary ,",
    "trapping in one of the @xmath55 phases ( even for @xmath62 ) will result in simulated @xmath59 s substantially differing from @xmath60 , in fact closer to the @xmath63 of phase @xmath55 .",
    "another hint of a good performance is to have @xmath64 regardless of @xmath34 .",
    "lastly , an extra checking is to calculate @xmath65 and @xmath66 . trapping implies in low fluctuations , i.e. @xmath67 , whereas frequent visit to the distinct regions gives @xmath68 . at the coexistence , @xmath69 .      , successful attempts in changing the system temperature @xmath70 will give rise to an exchange frequency @xmath71 .",
    "the fef protocol requires @xmath2 to be chosen so that for any @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "( b ) for @xmath8 , small variations in the intermediate temperature @xmath74 will modify the fef exchange frequency @xmath7 as indicated ( with @xmath75 ) . ]    as already mentioned , given @xmath0 , distinct key aspects  specially for the st @xcite  are involved in the @xmath5 s choice .",
    "one example is the actual value of @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , higher @xmath76 s facilitate the system to escape from the metastable states at @xmath3 ( the temperature of interest ) .",
    "but then , the exchange probability may be too low .",
    "conversely , the frequency of exchanges certainly increases for lower @xmath76 s , but this time the trapping might not be overcome . of course",
    ", one solution would be to use many replicas , however to the expense of lengthy simulations .    to simplify and improve the determination of @xmath2 , we propose the following protocol .",
    "once fixed @xmath3 , we choose @xmath77 in such a way that the resulting exchange frequencies @xmath78 between any two successive temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 are all equal to some value @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we define @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the number of time steps in a monte carlo run .",
    "note that the highest temperature , @xmath81 , is automatically established by the procedure , an advantage in contrast with some other recipes ( see below ) .",
    "the next step is to `` probe '' the efficiency of the obtained @xmath2 by means of tests like those described in the end of sec .",
    "the existence of trapping indicates that @xmath76 is low and @xmath7 should be decreased , raising @xmath76 . on the opposite",
    ", a very high @xmath76 ( resulting from a too low @xmath7 ) implies in a very small fraction of exchanges and hence poor averages , so @xmath7 should be increased .",
    "an optimal tuning ( respect to the present recipe ) will lead to @xmath82 , given rise to a balanced tunneling between the phases and a faster convergence to the steady state .",
    "this would accelerate the calculations and improve the estimates accuracy .",
    "finally , three technical aspects must be pointed out .",
    "first , some numerical work is necessary to find @xmath82 .",
    "however , such process demands relative short simulations ( e.g. , it is not necessary to evolve the system until full convergence ) .",
    "thus , the search for the corresponding optimal @xmath2 is not computationally time consuming .",
    "second , usually one shall study phase transitions in a region , instead only at one point @xmath83 , of the parameters space . from the exploratory numerics we have performed ( representative examples in sec .",
    "iii ) , we found that once an optimal set of temperatures is determined for a specific @xmath83 , in a not too small vicinity around it the same set also yields rapid and good results .",
    "so , in exploring sectors of the parameters space one needs to find only few optimal @xmath2 s .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 does not significantly change for reasonable different system sizes @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the procedure can be helpful for finite scale size analysis @xcite .",
    "third , @xmath81 for @xmath82 is a value which at once allows enough temperatures exchanges , yet resulting in proper tunneling between the phases .",
    "thus , an eventual further improvement of @xmath2 should not drastically change @xmath81 , just modifying the intermediate temperatures @xmath84 . from our construction , at @xmath82",
    "the combined exchange frequency from @xmath3 to @xmath76 is roughly proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "let us consider fig . 1 ( b ) with @xmath8 .",
    "increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath74 , with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , the overall transition frequency @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) reads : @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "although we have not been able to derive expressions for the @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s , from exhaustive numerics we never found @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s making @xmath94 considerably larger than @xmath95 .",
    "so , extra variations of the @xmath5 s around the values in the optimal @xmath2 makes the procedure much more cumbersome and does not seem importantly to improve the method .",
    "here we apply the fef approach to three lattice models , beg , bl , and potts , also comparing some results with those for the st using other schemes to select @xmath2 .",
    "so , we need first to brief discuss few distinct methods to obtain the @xmath5 s .",
    "some proposals are rather simple , usually not taking explicit into account the physical aspect of the system ( but refers to @xcite for the particular case of constant specific heats ) . the exception being usually the numerical procedure to set the final temperature @xmath76 @xcite . along this line",
    ", one example is to assume ( given @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath76 ) the intermediate temperatures forming an arithmetic progression ( ap ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a more thermodynamic - oriented method is the constant entropy ( ce ) protocol , proposed in @xcite ( and extended in @xcite for distinct lattice - gas models ) .",
    "it consists of choosing intermediate @xmath5 values so to lead to a same fixed difference of entropy between successive temperatures ( but again , somehow @xmath76 must be first determined ) .",
    "specifically , if at @xmath3 and @xmath81 the system entropy per volume is , respectively , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we set @xmath5 such that @xmath98 .",
    "once the transfer matrix method of sec .",
    "ii - a gives the free energy , the evaluation of entropies for the ce protocol follows from @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "thus , an immediate advantage of fef with respect to both as and ce is that it directly provides an optimal @xmath76 necessary for the system to circumvent the entropic barriers .",
    "we also observe that close to the phase transition , where a small change of the control parameter results in a great variation of @xmath101 , the fef and the ce yield more clustered @xmath5 s . because quantities like @xmath102 and @xmath101 undergo pronounced changes around the phase transition , a clustered @xmath2 is in general more efficient .",
    "so , in advance one should expect ce and fef better than as .",
    "the beg @xcite is a generalization of the ising model , where the spin variable presents three values @xmath103 . in a fluid language , it corresponds to a lattice - gas model with distinct species ( @xmath104 ) and vacancies ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian also presents an extra interaction term , proportional to @xmath106 , reading @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath33 interaction energies and @xmath109 the chemical potential .",
    "its phase diagram is relatively complex , displaying phases with distinct structural properties . for the @xmath33 s",
    "we consider here and in the regime of low temperatures , a first - order transition separates liquid and gas phases for high and low chemical potentials , respectively .",
    "the order parameter is the particle density @xmath110 . at the steady state",
    "the system presents two liquid phases ( with densities close to @xmath111 ) coexisting with one gas phase ( of @xmath112 ) .",
    "since they have equal weights , @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , the liquid - gas phase coexistence emerges at @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the coordination number . by increasing @xmath4 ,",
    "an order - disorder phase transition takes place , being continuous or discontinuous depending on how high is @xmath4 .",
    "the transfer matrix , used to evaluate the weights for the st method and the entropy , is given by @xmath117 .",

    ", @xmath120 indicates the possibility of hydrogen bonding formation between adjacent molecules .",
    "each molecule has six arms ( in angles of 120@xmath121 ) , such that three of them are inert , while the other three are the bonding arms .",

    "the lattice is nearly fully filled with @xmath130 .",
    "also in contrast with the liquid phase for the beg model , the hdl phase is highly degenerated . at @xmath114 ,",
    "gas - ldl and ldl - hdl transitions are first - order and occur at @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . for @xmath133 ,",

    "finally , we recall that for larger @xmath4 s , obviously the phase coexistence takes place for distinct values of the chemical potentials ( e.g. , for the bl and @xmath170 , the gas - ldl phase transitions is at @xmath171 ) . in those cases",
    "the proposed protocol also works better than other procedures to choose the replicas temperatures ( as we have explicit verified ) .",
    "but since then the entropic barriers are lower , the present very strong first - order phase transition is a more interesting context for our comparative analysis .",

    "in this contribution we have proposed a simple method to determine the set of @xmath5 s for the st algorithm . for a given number of replicas @xmath0 , adjacent @xmath5 s",
    "are chosen in such a way that changes of temperature ( from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , for any @xmath187 ) occur with a fixed frequency @xmath7 .",
    "then , from simulations demanding a relative small number of time steps we test , e.g. , the decay toward the steady regime and the tunneling rate between distinct coexisting phases .",
    "such tests can benchmark the efficiency of @xmath2 resulting from this @xmath7 . repeating the procedure ,",
    "it is possible to find an optimal @xmath82 leading to a best @xmath2 ( including a proper @xmath76 ) .",
    "note that for some other schemes , there is no specific rules to determine the extreme temperature necessary for the system to cross the entropic barriers .",
    "the searching for @xmath82 demands some preliminary numerics , nevertheless twofold compensated .",
    "first , the full simulations  for the final estimation of the thermodynamical quantities  will converge faster and with greater accuracy .",
    "second , the same optimal @xmath2 can be used to simulate the system for other parameters values , around the original @xmath188 used to determine @xmath82 .",
    "the reliability and precision of the fef scheme have been analyzed in the extreme situation of systems presenting first - order phase transitions at low @xmath4 s . in all examples",
    "we have obtained very good thermodynamic estimates ( even for @xmath8 ) without the necessity of long simulations .",
    "in fact , one of the advantages of using the fef to select @xmath2 is that once at the optimum case , the results are already very good for @xmath0 small , hence facilitating the numerical implementation .",
    "furthermore , comparison with other temperature schemes , ap and ce , have been undertaken .",
    "the fef has been found to be always superior to the others , specially for small @xmath0 s .    to conclude , we shall comment on the following .",
    "first , in the last few years distinct protocols have been proposed for dealing with the difficult situation of first - order transitions at low @xmath4 s . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite shows how to increase visits to regions of high free - energies ( hence with very low probability to be accessed ) considering additional multiple gaussian weights for the ensembles describing the system .",
    "moreover , a combination with the parallel tempering is used for restoring ergodicity . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is devised an adaptive ( `` on the flight '' ) approach for the st weights , whose evaluations follow a modified distribution @xcite . in fact , using the st with independent modified - weight runs , the tunneling between the phases is strongly facilitated .    although certainly the above methods are of very broad usage and important contributions to handle such hard problem , our proposal somehow strikes in a different direction .",
    "actually , not only the free energy weights are evaluated directly from standard mc simulations ( so , without no effective resampling procedures , which eventually could depend on systems particularities ) , but also adequate `` probings '' of the phase space distinct regions are achieved solely from the tempering . as shown , the crucial point is to determine a good temperature set , possible through relative inexpensive simulations .",
    "thus , our approach is easier to implement and can be faced as a generic algorithm , not requiring too much details about the specific system .",
    "the mentioned methods are very efficient , but may demand elaborate implementations focusing the specific case at hands ( e.g. , properly tuning dynamic dependent parameters ) .",
    "second , although we have used an optimized protocol to determine @xmath2 for a tempering method , applying it to first - order transitions ( where the specific @xmath5 s may be crucial ) , we believe the main ideas here can also be useful for second - order phase transitions . indeed , in second - order phase transitions the trapping in metastable states is not generally present .",
    "however , at the criticality the system is strongly affected by a slow time decay of correlation functions ( critical slowing down ) @xcite . in such case , an optimal @xmath2 might provide a faster decay of correlations , thus allowing a more precise evaluation of the system properties .",
    "in fact , a practical way to achieve so would be to find @xmath82 which minimizes the relaxation time @xmath189 of a given relevant correlation function .",
    "third , in the so called parallel tempering ( pt ) , usually exchanges of temperature are not restricted to adjacent replicas ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , hence the exact set @xmath2 is not so crucial ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a simpler algorithm using only adjacent exchanges eventually would require a more appropriate choice for @xmath2 , which could then be determined by the fef .    the above two possible applications for our method are presently being implemented and will be reported in the due course .",
    "we acknowledge research grants from cnpq and computational facilities provided by ct - infra - finep and cnpq - edital universal .",
