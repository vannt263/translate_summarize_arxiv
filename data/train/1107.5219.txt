    "most proteins are generated within the cellular cytosol and have to be transported where they are needed .",
    "frequently , they have to be transported across membranes , e.g.  into the endoplasmatic reticulum , mitochondria or other organelles , or they are secreted , i.e.transported across the cell wall @xcite .",
    "protein translocation occurs either _ co - translationally _",
    ", e.g.  when ribosomes attach to the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and proteins are transported into the lumen through a nanopore already during translation , or _",
    "post - translationally _ @xcite .",
    "consider translocation into _ mitochondria _ first . over 99% of mitochondrial proteins",
    "are translocated post - translationally @xcite and the molecular mechanisms have been studied in detail .",
    "when a substrate is translocated into the mitochondrium , it has to cross the translocase outer membrane ( tom ) and the translocase inner membrane ( tim ) .",
    "the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 ( mthsp70 ) is known to play a crucial role in translocation of substrates @xcite .",
    "mthsp70 changes between its atp - bound form , where it has an open pocket for binding to the substrate , and the adp - bound form where the pocket is closed @xcite .",
    "there are two differing opinions about the role of mthsp70 in translocation .",
    "either mthsp70 pulls _ actively _ the substrate through the nanopore , or it only prevents backsliding of the substrate , leading to a _ passive _ mechanism @xcite .",
    "such a ratcheting mechanism was first introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the best argument for active pulling is that the protein which is translocated must be unfolded outside the mitochondria , so translocation occurs against a force @xcite .",
    "however , experimental evidence is still lacking and binding of mthsp70 to the substrate can explain observations @xcite .",
    "many proteins are translocated into the _ endoplasmatic reticulum _ already during translation .",
    "moreover , post - translational translocation has been suggested to occur through a passive ratcheting mechanism in eukaryotic cells by @xcite . here",
    ", the nanopore is formed by the sec63 complex and the ratcheting molecules are called bip which is a member of the hsp70 family .",
    "bip exists in an atp - bound state with an open binding pocket .",
    "this is activated by an interaction with the j - domain of sec63 , which can also close the binding pocket after bip is bound to the substrate .",
    "interestingly , bip binds unspecifically to the substrate and therefore is able to mediate translocation of many different proteins @xcite . for protein translocation into _ chloroplasts _ in plants , ratcheting mechanisms have not yet been considered yet @xcite .",
    "quantitative descriptions of cellular ratcheting mechanisms began with pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in their model , ratcheting molecules can bind to the protein at the nanopore and hinder diffusion out of the nanopore completely ( perfect ratchet ) or only with a probability @xmath2 ( imperfect ratchet ) .",
    "the assumption that ratcheting molecules can only bind directly at the pore is motivated by translocation into the endoplasmatic reticulum where the ratcheting molecule , bip , is known to interact with sec61 which builds the pore .",
    "however , the interaction with the nanopore can only mean that concentration of ratcheting molecules is higher near the pore .",
    "( see @xcite , for a mathematical model of the interaction of the ratcheting molecule with the nanopore . )",
    "we take the same approach as @xcite and assume that ratcheting molecules may bind uniformly along the protein .",
    "this assumes that the concentration of ratcheting molecules is approximately constant between the pore and the first bound molecules .",
    "most quantitative descriptions of the brownian ratchet assume a finite length of ratcheting molecules ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite describe a _ car parking effect _ arising by the distribution of ratcheting molecules along the substrate .",
    "they assume a fast binding and unbinding of ratcheting molecules , leading to an effective probability any position of the protein is bound .",
    "the case of fast binding is studied in @xcite , who derive a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem in the case that brownian motion has a drift .",
    "effects of binding affinities which depend on the protein sequence have been put forward in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce a realistic model for the ratcheting mechanism for protein translocation in mitochondria and the endoplasmatic reticulum as described above .",
    "@xcite tried to decide if translocation happens actively ( by pulling the protein ) or passively ( by a ratcheting mechanism ) using likelihood ratio tests .",
    "however , after fitting the model parameters using least squares , their statistical tests were not significant and both models fitted experimental data well .",
    "new molecular techniques have to give rise to better data to decide between active an passive transport . in the present paper",
    ", we obtain predictions for the speed of translocation which will shed light on empirical studies in the future .",
    "our model of the brownian ratchet is similar to the ratchet studied in @xcite , but is continuous , assumes free diffusion of the protein and binding of ratcheting molecules anywhere along the protein .",
    "since ratcheting molecules can dissociate from the protein , we call the process a _ broken brownian ratchet_. we give two models , termed model  i and model  ii . for model",
    "i , which takes into account every ratcheting molecule at all times , we can only show that the speed of translocation is positive ( theorem  [ t : speedi ] ) .",
    "model  ii serves as an approximation . when a ratcheting molecule dissociates , we assume that binding and unbinding of ratcheting molecules is in equilibrium .",
    "this model is easier to analyze but has about the same behavior for the speed of translocation ( see the simulation results in figure  [ fig3 ] ) . for model  ii",
    ", we can show a law of large numbers giving the speed of transport in terms of a solution of a differential equation , theorem  [ t : speedii ] .",
    "the model we study extends the brownian ratchet introduced in @xcite .",
    "namely , protein translocation across a membrane is based on the following assumptions :    1 cm    1 .",
    "the protein moves in and out with the same probability .",
    "the protein movement is reflected at binding ratcheting molecules .",
    "the protein is infinitely long .",
    "4 .   the ratcheting molecules are infinitely small .",
    "ratcheting molecules may bind to the protein at a continuum of sites .",
    "the ratcheting molecules may dissociate from the protein .",
    "these assumptions are exactly the same as in @xcite except for the last .",
    "they assumed that the dissociation rate of the ratcheting molecules from the protein is much smaller than their binding rate to the protein , leading to effectively no dissociation of ratcheting molecules .",
    "first , we translate the above set of assumptions into a mathematical model . by @xmath3",
    ", we denote the total length of the protein which already crossed the membrane between times @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is the largest distance of @xmath3 to a ratcheting molecule .",
    "we assume that the protein has already moved across the membrane by time @xmath4 , such that ratcheting molecules may bind between @xmath3 and @xmath7 at constant rate .",
