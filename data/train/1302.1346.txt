    "the radio emission of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is synchrotron radiation generated in the relativistic jets that emerge from the nucleus of the galaxy , presumably along the rotational axis of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "synchrotron radiation can be highly linearly polarized , up to @xmath1 in the case of a uniform magnetic ( * b * ) field ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "linear polarization observations are essential , as they give information about the orientation and degree of order of the * b * field , as well as the distribution of thermal electrons and the * b*-field geometry in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "many theorists have suggested that the magnetic fields of these sources are closely connected with the collimation of the jets , and could determine whether sources have prominent jets or not ( eg . meier et al .",
    "thus , information on the magnetic fields of these sources is essential in helping us better understand various physical processes in agn jets .",
    "vlbi polarization observations of bl  lac objects have shown a tendency for the polarization * e * vectors in the parsec - scale jets to be aligned with the local jet direction , which implies that the corresponding * b * field is transverse to the jet , because the jet is optically thin ( gabuzda , pushkarev & cawthorne 2000 ) .",
    "it seems likely that many of these transverse * b * fields represent the ordered toroidal component of the intrinsic * b * fields of the jets , as discussed by gabuzda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , see also references therein . depending on the observer s viewing angle and the helix s pitch angle",
    ", helical jet * b * fields can also give rise to a ` spine - sheath ' polarization structure in the frame of the observer , with a region of longitudinal polarization ( transverse * b*-vectors ) along the central ` spine ' of the jet surrounded by regions of transverse polarization ( longitudinal * b*-vectors ) near the edges of the jet .",
    "the presence of transverse polarization near the edges of the jet could be a natural consequence of a helical jet * b * field , although it has also been suggested to be due to interaction with the surrounding medium ( laing 1996 ; lyutikov , pariev & gabuzda 2005 ; attridge , roberts & wardle 1999 ; pushkarev et al . 2005 ) .",
    "faraday rotation studies can play a key role in determining the intrinsic * b * field geometries associated with the jets .",
    "faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs during the passage of an electromagnetic wave through a region with free electrons and a magnetic field with a non - zero component along the line - of - sight .",
    "the amount of rotation is proportional to the integral of the density of free electrons @xmath2 multiplied by the line - of - sight * b * field , the square of the observing wavelength @xmath3 , and various physical constants ; the coefficient of @xmath3 is called the rotation measure ( rm ) : @xmath4 the intrinsic polarization angle can be obtained from the relation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the observed polarization angle , @xmath7 is the intrinsic polarization angle in the absence of faraday rotation and @xmath8 is the observing wavelength .",
    "simultaneous multifrequency observations thus potentially enable the determination of the rm , as well as identification of the intrinsic polarization angles .",
    "systematic gradients in the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) have been reported previously across the parsec - scale jets of several agns , interpreted as reflecting the systematic change in the line - of - sight component of a toroidal or helical jet * b * field across the jet ( blandford 1993 , asada et al .",

    "[ tab : evpa_red ]    .evpa calibrations for 17 january 2004 [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      taylor & zavala ( 2010 ) have recently proposed four criteria for the reliable detection of transverse faraday rotation gradients , the most stringent of which is that the observed rm gradient span at least three `` resolution elements '' across the jet .",
    "this criterion reflects the desire to ensure that it is possible to distinguish properties between regions located on opposite sides of the jets .",
    "the criterion of three `` resolution elements '' has been taken to correspond to three beamwidths , and coincides with the general idea that structures separated by less than a beamwidth are not well resolved .    to test the validity of this criterion of taylor & zavala ( 2010 )",
    ", we constructed core ",
    "jet - like sources with various intrinsic widths and with transverse rm gradients present across their structures , and carried out monte carlo simulations based on these model sources .",
    "a description of our monte carlo simulations and the results they yielded are presented in the appendix .",
    "the transverse source widths for our model sources correspond to intrinsic widths of about 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/5 , 1/10 and 1/20 of the beam full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) in the direction across the jet .",
    "the simulations show that the transverse rm gradients introduced into the model visibility data remain visible in the rm maps constructed from `` noisy '' data having the same distribution of @xmath16 points as our observations of 0716 + 714 , even when the intrinsic width of the structure is much smaller than the beam width .",
    "both uni - directional model rm gradients and model rm structure containing two oppositely directly transverse gradients in the core region and jet are visible for all the jet widths considered .",
    "the results of these new monte carlo simulations thus directly demonstrate that the three - beamwidth criterion of taylor & zavala ( 2010 ) is overly restrictive , since the simulations directly show the possibility of detecting transverse rm gradients even when the intrinsic widths of the corresponding source structures are much less than the beamwidth , resulting in rm distributions that span only @xmath17 beamwidths .",
    "this demonstrates that the relatively modest widths spanned by the transverse rm gradients in 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 that we report here should not be taken by themselves as grounds to question the reliability of these gradients .",
    "we note here that our monte carlo simulations are not intended to provide a physical model for our observations , or to reproduce our observed rm distributions in any detail ; instead , they are intended solely to demonstrate the possibility of detecting a transverse rm gradient in real data , even if the intrinsic jet width is much smaller than the beam fwhm .",

    "this suggests that there may be up to a @xmath18 probability that the rm gradients we report here are spurious , due to their relatively limited widths , although we consider this to be unlikely , given that the rm differences involved correspond to as much as @xmath20 .      with regard to the other criteria for reliability of transverse rm gradients proposed by taylor & zavala ( 2010 ) , the criterion that the change in the rm across the jet be at least @xmath19",

    "[ fig:1749_transdist ] ) are approximately @xmath22 .    the criterion that the change in the rm be monotonic and smooth within the errors is also satisfied by the gradients in both 0716 + 714 and in 1749 + 701 . although the gradients suggested by the slices displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig:0716_rm ] and [ fig:1749_rm ] are not constant ( linear ) , they are nevertheless monotonic .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the simulated rm maps of broderick & mckinney ( 2010 ) typically do not show rm gradients with a constant slope all across the rm distribution after convolution , even though the intrinsic predicted gradients are monotonic [ see , for example , their fig .  8 bottom right panels ] .",
    "the remaining criterion proposed by taylor & zavala ( 2010 ) is that the spectrum be optically thin at the location of the observed rm gradient .",
    "this criterion is motivated by two factors : ( i ) the desire to avoid possible jumps in the observed polarization angles due to optically thick  thin transitions with the observed frequency range , and ( ii ) the fact that the fractional polarization can change rapidly with optical depth in the optically thick regime , leading to the possibility of wavelength - dependent polarization effects when regions having different optical depths at different frequencies are superposed , which could in principle lead to the fitting of spurious rm values in optically thick regions when these are inhomogeneous .",
    "this criterion is clearly satisfied by the gradients across the jets of 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 , which are all optically thin .",
    "the core regions of these two objects are also predominantly , but not fully , optically thin .",
    "the core - region spectral indices and @xmath23 values provide no evidence for a transition between optically thick and optically thin in the frequency rangees considered , consistent with the fact that the observed faraday rotations in the polarization angles are all no greater than a few tens of degrees .",
    "thus , there is no reason to suspect that jumps in the observed polarization angles due to optical - depth transitions are contributing to the observed core - region rms .",
    "we can not completely rule out the possibility that the polarization angles in the core - region are subject to wavelength - dependent optical - depth effects , however , we consider this to be unlikely , for two reasons : ( i ) the degrees of polarization in the core regions are @xmath24 for 0716 + 714 and @xmath25 for 1749 + 701 , indicating a substantial contribution from optically thin regions ; and ( ii ) the quality of the @xmath26 fits for the core regions is no worse than for the optically thin jet regions .    thus , our detection of the rm gradients across the jets can be considered firm , while the detection of the oppositely directed rm gradients across the core may be somewhat more tentative , due to the small possibility that the observed polarization could be affected by optical depth effects at some of the observed frequencies .",
    "this is much less likely to be the case for 1749 + 701 , since the observed frequencies span the relatively narrow range from 1.361.67  ghz .      in both",

    "we can offer several possible explanations for this result .",
    "we briefly discuss these below , and explain our reasoning for identifying the one that we think is the most likely ( see also mahmud et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "* torsional oscillations of the jet .",
    "* one possible interpretation of oppositely directed core and jet transverse rm gradients , could be that the direction of the azimuthal * b * field component changed as a result of torsional oscillations of jet ( bisnovatyi  kogan 2007 ) .",
    "such torsional oscillations , which may help stabilize the jets , could cause a flip of the azimuthal * b * field from time to time , or equivalently with distance from the core , given the jet outflow . in this scenario",
    ", we expect that the direction of the observed transverse rm gradients may reverse from time to time when the direction of the torsional oscillation reverses ; this reversal pattern would presumably then propagate outward with the jet .",
    "* reversal of the `` pole '' facing the earth .",
    "* another possible interpretation could be that the `` pole '' of the black hole facing the earth reversed .",
    "one way to retain a transverse rm gradient in a helical magnetic field model but reverse the direction of this gradient , is if the direction of rotation of the central black hole ( i.e.  the direction in which the field threading the accretion disc is `` wound up '' ) remains constant , but the `` pole '' of the black hole facing the earth changes from north to south , or vice versa . to our knowledge , it is currently not known whether such polarity reversals are possible for the central black hole of agn , or on what time scale they could occur .",
    "* nested - helix b - field structure . *",
    "a simpler and more likely explanation is a magnetic - tower - type model , with poloidal magnetic flux and poloidal current concentrated around the central axis ( lynden - bell 1996 ; nakamura et al .",
    "fundamental physics dictates that the magnetic - field lines must close ; in this picture , the magnetic field forms meridional loops that are anchored in the inner and outer parts of the accretion disc , which become twisted due to the differential rotation of the disc",
    ". this should essentially give rise to an `` inner '' helical b field near the jet axis and an `` outer '' helical field somewhat further from the jet axis .",
    "these two regions of helical field will be associated with oppositely directed rm gradients , and the total observed rm gradient will be determined by which region of helical field dominates the observed rms .",
    "thus , the presence of a change in the direction of the observed transverse rm gradient between the core / innermost jet and jet regions well resolved from the core could represent a transition from dominance of the inner to dominance of the outer helical * b * fields in the total observed rm .",
    "this seems to provide the simplest explanation for the rm - gradient reversals we observe in these two objects .",
    "typically , we would expect the direction of the rm gradients in the core and jet ( i.e. , the regions whose net rm is determined by the inner / outer helical fields ) to remain constant in time , since they should be determined by the source geometry and viewing angle .",
    "mahmud et al . ( 2009 ) discuss the possibility that this type of `` nested helical field '' structure could also occasionally give rise to changes in the direction of the observed rm gradients with time within a given source .",
    "the polarization rotation - measure images for the two bl  lac objects presented here provide new evidence in support of helical magnetic fields associated with the jets of these agn , most importantly , the presence of transverse rotation measure gradients across the jets of both objects .",
    "there is also a dominance of transverse * b * fields in the jets of 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 , and signs of ` spine - sheath ' polarization structures or orthogonal polarization offset toward one side of the jet in both these sources , consistent with the possibility that these jets carry a helical magnetic - field component : this type of structure can also come about naturally in the case of a helical jet * b * field ( e.g. lyutikov et al . 2005 ; pushkarev et al .",
    "we interpret the observed transverse rm gradients as being due to the systematic variation of the toroidal component of a helical * b * field across the jet ( blandford 1993 ) .",
    "we note in this connection that the transverse rm gradients in both 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 have opposite signs on either side of the jet , making it impossible to explain the gradients as an effect of changing thermal - electron density alone ( there must be a change in the direction of the line - of - sight magnetic field ) .",
    "we have also detected tentative transverse rm gradients in the region of the observed vlbi core in both bl  lac objects , which can be interpreted as being associated with helical * b * fields in the innermost jets of these sources .",
    "further , we have found a striking new feature of the rm distributions in these objects : a reversal in the direction of the transverse rm gradients .",
    "similar reversals can be seen in the rm images for 3c  120 presented by gmez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . at first",
    ", this seems difficult to understand , since the direction of the rm gradient associated with a helical * b * field is essentially determined by the direction of the rotation of the central accretion disc and the direction of the poloidal field it winds up .",
    "we suggest that the most likely explanation for these reversals is that we are dealing with a ` nested - helical - field ' structure such as that present in magnetic - tower models , in which poloidal field lines emerging from the inner accretion disc form meridional loops that close in the outer part of the disc , with both sides of the loops ( which have oppositely directed poloidal field components ) getting ` wound up ' by the disc rotation .",
    "further observations and studies of the rm - gradient reversals observed in these objects can potentially provide key information about how the geometry of the magnetic fields in these agn jets evolve , and may provide information on the jet dynamics and jet collimation .",

    "<S> the idea that systematic faraday rotation gradients across the parsec - scale jets of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can reveal the presence of helical magnetic ( * b * ) fields has been around since the early 1990s , although the first observation of this phenomenon was about ten years later . </S>",
    "<S> these gradients are taken to be due to the systematic variation of the line - of - sight * b * field across the jet . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the parsec - scale faraday rotation distributions for the bl  lac objects 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 , based on polarization data obtained with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at two wavelengths near each of the 2 cm , 4 cm and 6 cm bands ( 0716 + 714 ) and at four wavelengths in the range 1822 cm ( 1749 + 701 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation measure ( rm ) maps for both these sources indicate systematic gradients across their jets , as expected if these jets have helical * b * fields . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of these transverse rm gradients is @xmath0 in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of monte carlo simulations directly demonstrating the possibility of observing such transverse rm gradients even if the intrinsic jet structure is much narrower than the observing beam . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an intriguing new feature in these sources , a reversal in the direction of the gradient in the jet as compared to the gradient in the core region . </S>",
    "<S> this provides new evidence to support models in which field lines emerging from the central region of the accretion disk and closing in the outer region of the accretion disk are both `` wound up '' by the differential rotation of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the net observed rm gradient will essentially be the sum effect of two regions of helical field , one nested inside the other . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the net rm gradient will be determined by whether the inner or outer helix dominates the rm integrated through the jet , and rm gradient reversals will be observed if the inner and outer helical fields dominate in different regions of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> this potentially provides new insights about the overall configuration of the jet * b * fields .    </S>",
