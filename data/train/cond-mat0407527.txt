    "the complexation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in different ionic conditions is an interesting problem of biological relevance.blomfieldreviw,raspaud98,levin02,k91 moreover , the association of two oppositely charged linear chains has implications in the design of new materials with unique properties such as multilayer polyelectrolytesde97,m04 , and carrier gels for drug delivery@xcite .",
    "industrial applications include uses as coatings , flocculants and absorbents.flocc,abs    charged chains can associate via many mechanisms given the large number of length scales involved in these mixtures .",
    "the properties of the complexes are strongly dependent on physical parameters such as salt and monomer concentrations , and on the chemical configurations of the chains such as their charge densities , persistence lengths , degrees of polymerization , and nature of the interactions between the charge groups along the backbone.k94,ger , d00,ts94,p97    complexes formed by chains with low charge densities have been analyzed using linearized models.@xcite these models are applicable to describe solutions with strongly hydrated charge groups of positive and negative charges , which interact weakly with each other . in these studies",
    "ion condensation effects@xcite can be neglected if the linear charge density is sufficiently low .",
    "the complexation in these systems occurs via collective charge fluctuations.@xcite with addition of salt the complexes dissolve due to screening of electrostatic interactions .    in certain polymer mixtures ,",
    "even when the charge density is low , non - linear effects are important if the charge groups are strongly interacting . in these mixtures the oppositely charged groups , when placed at short separation distances , can be locally dehydrated , and act as localized short - range crosslinks between oppositely charged groups along the chains .",
    "the formation of these links generates a thermoreversibly crosslinked solution@xcite of oppositely charged chains . the number of crosslinks formed in equilibrium in such thermoreversibly associating chains is given by the law of mass action with an effective association constant . in uncharged systems",
    "the association constant depends exponentially on the strength of the short range attraction between the reactive groups . for charged reactive groups ,",
    "however , there is an additional term in the association constant due to the electrostatic contribution to the free energy resulting from the collective charge fluctuations .",
    "since association occurs between the ions belonging to oppositely charged chains , this additional electrostatic term always increases the rate of association .",
    "the importance of non - linear association of charges has been recently recognized in polyelectrolyte adsorption@xcite and multilayer formationm02 .    in this work",
    "the electrostatic interactions are described using a two - fold approach .",
    "the strongly non - linear short - range interactions between oppositely charged groups are accounted for by including strong correlations between the chains .",
    "the long - range electrostatic interactions ( which are weak for weakly charged polyelectrolytes ) are accounted for in a linearized way by computing the fluctuations of this correlated solution of crosslinked charged chains using a generalized debye - hckel approach ( random phase approximation).@xcite the electrostatic free energy depends onthe structure of charged polymer clusters , while the cluster distribution depends ( through the modified law of mass action ) on the electrostatic free energy .",
    "therefore , we determine here the number of formed crosslinks by evaluating self - consistently the electrostatic contribution from the collective charge fluctuations of a crosslinked system of charged chains .",
    "the degree of hydrophobicity of the chain backbone modifies the thermodynamics of the solution.@xcite we consider non - selective solvents , where the degree of compatibility is the same for both the positively and negatively charged chains .",
    "we investigate how the degree of hydrophobicity influences the properties of complexes formed by electrostatic interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the model and approximations used , and derive the free energy of the solution ; the details of the derivation of the correlation function of the crosslinked system required to determine the electrostatic contribution to the free energy is given in appendix [ app ] . in section [ express ]",
    "we discuss how different system parameters influence the properties of the formed complex and its response to addition of salt .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we calculate the free energy of a homogeneous semidilute solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes . for simplicity in this work we consider only the absolutely symmetric case . positively and",
    "negatively charged chains are present in the solution in equal concentrations , and have the  same physical properties except  the sign of the charge .",
    "the chains have degree of polymerization @xmath0 .",
    "the fraction of charged monomers on both types of chains is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "we consider only weakly charged chains for which @xmath1 is small enough , so that electrostatic energy of adjacent along the chain charges is smaller than the thermal energy.kh82,d95 the number concentrations of positively and negatively charged monomeric units are @xmath2 , so that the total concentration of monomeric units in the solution is @xmath3 .",
    "each charged monomeric unit releases a monovalent counterion .",
    "a 1:1 low molecular salt can also be present in the solution with concentration of positively and negatively charged ions given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and the total concentration of salt ions @xmath6 .",
    "since the effect of counterions is equivalent to addition of salt we include the counterions in the salt .",
    "we describe strong electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged monomeric units as thermoreversible bond ( crosslink ) formation .",
    "this strong non - linear interaction should be treated differently from the long - range electrostatic part which is treated within the random phase approximation ( rpa).@xcite another reason why formation of ionic pairs should be considered in addition to coulomb interactions is because formation of ionic pairs can proceed with the rearrangement of the solvation shell of charges on polymer . in this case",
    "the effective dielectric constant between charges in a pair can differ significantly from the bulk solvent dielectric constant .",
    "thus , the bond energy in a pair can be quite high .",
    "a natural model to describe such ion - pairing is reversible association between charges of opposite signs . for simplicity",
    "we assume that only pairs can be formed , with the absolute value of the reduced bond energy @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath9 the thermodynamic temperature ) , which gives rise to association constant @xmath10 .",
    "note that bond formation is different from short - range van der waals attraction in that it has the saturation property , that is , once a bond between two given ions is formed they do not interact with any other ions .",
    "we write the free energy of the solution of associating polyelectrolytes in the following form@xmath11where the first term is the free energy of the reference neutral system ( but with short - range interactions ) and the second term is the contribution of electrostatics .",
    "the electrostatic part @xmath12 is calculated within the rpa , which is a linear theory equivalent to the debye - hckel approximation ( i.e. , to the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation ) . for the reference free energy we use the flory - huggins mean - field approximation @xmath13which includes the ideal entropic and enthalpic terms . in our associating system",
    "the ideal term is the free energy of ideal gas of all possible clusters @xmath14 with appropriate statistical weights @xmath15@xmath16as well the entropy of the ideal gas of salt ions ( counterions are also included here ) .",
    "as has been shown in the refs the equilibrium concentrations @xmath17 can be obtained using a diagrammatic technique and the free energy of associating chains can be written as@xmath18 -\\frac{% \\rho f\\gamma } { 2}\\ln \\left [ \\frac{\\rho f\\gamma } { 2e}ve^{\\varepsilon } \\right ] \\label{ass}\\]]here conversion @xmath19 is the fraction of polymeric ions in pairs ( see appendix [ app ] ) , which is to be found from subsequent minimization of the total free energy of the solution . the volume of the monomeric unit @xmath20 ( which we for simplicity assume to be equal to @xmath21 ) is used to approximate the internal partition function of the crosslink @xmath22 .",
    "alternative combinatorial derivation of ( ass ) can be performed along the lines of ref .",

    "the polymer structure correlation functions ( [ pc1][mo2 ] ) diverge at the gelation condition @xmath74 , which is simply due to the fact that gelation corresponds to the formation of  an  infinite cluster .",
    "it is remarkable that the electrostatic free energy ( [ frpa3 ] ) has no corresponding singularity at the gelation structural transition .",
    "this is due to the charge symmetry of the considered system .",

    "( it can be shown that for any asymmetric system ( asymmetry of @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath1 ) the infinite cluster is charged and , accordingly , expression for @xmath12 has a singularity at and beyond the gelation transition .",

    "let us look at the limiting cases of eq [ frpa3 ] . by putting @xmath77",
    "we regain  the well - known expression for free unassociated chains , and if we put @xmath78 , the polyelectrolyte chains do not contribute to @xmath12 .",
    "however , since @xmath58 is only the effective conversion:@xmath79 the equality @xmath78 is possible only when @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on all finite lengthscales ( @xmath82 )",
    "charges in crosslinks still contribute to the electrostatic free energy @xmath12 .",
    "this is natural , since in our model of crosslinking the two opposite charges do not annihilate , rather they are considered as separate charges with gaussian correlations between them , which leads to the emergence of effective conversion @xmath58 , instead of bare conversion @xmath19 . because the charges do not annihilate",
    "when the ionic pairs are formed , we subtract the self - energy of all ions present in the system ( last term in ( [ frpa3 ] ) ) , regardless of whether they are free or form crosslinks .",
    "the chain correlation functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined by ( [ sg ] ) and ( [ hf ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath56 can be easily calculated in the continuous limit , the result being the well - known debye structure function .",
    "however , we also need the correct limit of pointlike ions at @xmath83 in ( [ frpa3 ] ) , since we subtract the self - energy of all ions therefore , we choose a simple interpolation form for the chain structure function @xmath56@xmath84which gives the correct limit at @xmath81 , has the scaling of a gaussian chain at @xmath85 , and reproduces pointlike ions at @xmath86 .",

    "obtains that @xmath97 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath19 for all @xmath98 , which is explained by the fact that as more ions associate they contribute less to the long - range attraction ( which can be seen directly from @xmath12 in ( [ frpa3 ] ) ) .",
    "due to its complete symmetry , only macroscopic phase separation is possible in the considered system . in our ternary incompressible system  of polymer , salt and solvent",
    "we have two independent components , which we choose to be polymer and salt .",
    "when macroscopic phase separation ( precipitation ) occurs the two coexisting phases differ in concentrations of both polymer and salt .",
    "thus , generally speaking , we have to calculate the phase diagrams of a ternary incompressible system .",
    "however , we are mostly interested in two aspects of the precipitation process : the influence of different competing complexation mechanisms on the density of the formed precipitate ( studied in the next section ) and determination of the conditions of solubility of the complexes with addition of salt ( section [ phd ] ) . in both of these cases",
    "we can make specific additional assumptions which allow us to investigate the mentioned problems in a simple and clear manner .      in our model",
    "we consider three complexation driving forces : long - range electrostatic attraction between co - ions , strongly non - linear short - range attraction leading to ion - crosslinking and van der waals attraction between all monomeric units . in this section ,",
    "we look at the density of the formed complex @xmath98 , in particular how @xmath98 depends on the relative importance of the three complexation factors as well as how the density is influenced by the addition of salt .",
    "we can significantly simplify the analysis if we make the following two assumptions ( similar to the ones employed in our previous work).@xcite first , we assume an infinite degree of polymerization @xmath99 .",
    "second , the total concentration of polymer chains in the whole solution ( system ) is assumed to be small . since the entropy of the chains represents the only driving force for dissolution of the polymer chains from the precipitate ,  the first assumption amounts to assuming zero polymer concentration in the supernatant ( which for a finite @xmath100 would be a  polymer - poor phase ) .",
    "the second assumption is equivalent to assuming that the salt volume fraction in the supernatant is equal to the salt volume fraction in the whole system , which we thus denote simply as @xmath101 .",
    "note that the salt volume fraction in the precipitate @xmath102 can differ considerably from @xmath103 , which , as we show below , has a significant effect on @xmath98 .",
    "given our assumptions , @xmath98 and @xmath104 can be found by equating the pressure and the chemical potential of the salt in the coexisting phases:@xmath105for convenience here and in the following we use a dimensionless equilibrium free energy density defined by @xmath106 .",
    "the equilibrium free energy @xmath87 is obtained from the minimization ( described in section [ secmin ] ) of the total free energy , which according to ( [ f11 ] ) is given by the sum of ( [ fref2 ] ) and ( frpa3 ) .",
    "we solve equations ( [ pr][mu ] ) numerically to obtain @xmath107 and @xmath104 , considering @xmath103 as a parameter .",
    "the results are given in figures 13 .",
    "in figure 1 we assume no van der waals attraction @xmath108 and plot results for varying bonding energy @xmath109 .",
    "( experiments on polyelectrolyte adsorption@xcite and multilayer formation@xcite are consistent with the value of binding energy @xmath92  varying between @xmath110 and @xmath111 . )",
    "we set the bjerrum length @xmath112 , and the fraction of charged monomers @xmath113 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath114 and @xmath1 for the case of complexation without crosslinking was investigated in our previous work.@xcite similar to the results for that case , @xmath98 increases with increasing @xmath114 and/or @xmath1 for all @xmath115 , @xmath92 or @xmath116 . with good precision",
    "one can obtain results for other values of @xmath1 simply by linearly scaling @xmath98 with @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the polymer volume fraction in the precipitate @xmath98 as a function of the salt volume fraction in the system @xmath103 .",
    "we see that for all values of @xmath92 the complex density monotonically decreases with increasing salt concentration .",
    "this is of course due to debye - hckel screening by salt , which makes the electrostatic attraction weaker ( the term @xmath12 in the total free energy ) .",
    "note that as @xmath12 becomes weaker the electrostatic binding energy @xmath117 , given by ( [ mg ] ) , also becomes smaller , thus both the long - range and short - range electrostatics become less efficient in forming the complex .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1(b ) , where we plot conversion @xmath19 for curves of plot figure 1(a ) .",
    "we see that conversion also monotonically drops when more salt is added to the system , the behavior being similar for all values of @xmath118 . with the increase of @xmath92 , conversion @xmath19 increases for all salt concentrations .",
    "however this does not directly translate into a denser complex as we can see from figure 1(a ) .",
    "indeed for @xmath119 we see that @xmath98 depends non - monotonically on @xmath118 , the feature which will be explored in detail in figure 3 . for large salt concentrations",
    "the density @xmath98 is larger for greater @xmath92 , which is obviously due to increased crosslinking of chains .",
    "the presence of crosslinks manifests itself in a feeble dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath103 for larger values of @xmath92 , which indicates indissolubility by salt of complexes formed primarily by specific short - range attractions . at the same time for small binding energies ( such as @xmath120 and @xmath110 ) in figure 1(a ) the density @xmath98 drops rather abruptly and becomes very small , which indicates dissolution of the complex with addition of salt ( this problem will be studied in the next section ) .",
    "the difference between the salt concentration in the precipitate @xmath121and that in the supernatant @xmath103 ( which , according to our assumption , is equal to the salt concentration in the whole system ) is presented in figure 1(c ) .",
    "we see that for small @xmath92 the precipitate is first enriched with salt , which ( as we showed previouslymine ) is due to correlational debye - hckel attraction . for small @xmath118 with increasing salt concentrations @xmath104 becomes smaller than @xmath103 and then as the complex becomes very diluted for large @xmath103 there is only a negligible difference . for large @xmath118",
    "we have @xmath122 for all salt concentrations .",
    "( note that we plot the difference @xmath123 in figure 1(c ) , of course @xmath104 increases with @xmath103 ) the depletion of salt was previously shown to be due to hardcore interactions.@xcite this depletion turns out to have a considerable effect on @xmath98 . in figure 1(a ) we plot with dashed lines the curves for @xmath124 and @xmath111 obtained from equation ( [ pr ] ) with the assumption @xmath125 .",
    "the effect can be seen to be especially substantial for larger values of @xmath103 .    in figure 2",
    "we illustrate the effect of the @xmath116-parameter for the case when the effect of association is small ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the complex is seen to become denser with increasing short - range attraction for all values of @xmath103 . for @xmath126 ( good  solvent )",
    "the volume fraction @xmath98 strongly decreases with increasing salt ( which is an indication of dissolution of the complex for finite @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath127 ( bad solvent condition ) the density is seen to be negligibly dependent on @xmath101 for large @xmath103 , with the complex being stable with respect to addition of salt . comparing figures 1(a ) and 2",
    "we observe that behavior of @xmath98 with increasing @xmath103 is qualitatively the same when the complex is formed by crosslinking ( @xmath92 ) or van der waals interactions ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that we analyze here only marginally bad solvent conditions , for which we can disregard the possibility of necklace formation.@xcite    the relative strength of the long - range electrostatic attraction vs. crosslinking is demonstrated in figure 3 .",
    "we plot the precipitate density @xmath107 in the salt - free solution as a function of bond energy @xmath92 .",
    "different curves correspond to varying @xmath116 , which spans good to marginal solvent conditions .",
    "increasing @xmath92 means that a greater number of charges form crosslinks . indeed from the numerical solution we obtain that in all cases @xmath19 monotonically increases with growing @xmath118 . thus increasing",
    "@xmath92 physically means changing the driving force of complexation from long - range charge correlation to crosslinking attraction ( numerically , at @xmath128 the conversion @xmath129 ) .",
    "interestingly , as we see from figure 3 , the density @xmath107 ( although it exhibits a shallow minimum as a function of @xmath130 is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath92 .",
    "thus , ion - pairing and long - range correlations lead to polyelectrolyte complexes of similar density and the two mechanisms can be difficult to distinguish experimentally for salt - free systems .",
    "curves for different @xmath116 show qualitatively the same behavior , with @xmath98 increasing as the solvent worsens .      as can be seen from figures .",
    "1(a ) and 2 for small @xmath92 and/or @xmath27 the density @xmath98 becomes very small with addition of enough salt , which is indicative of precipitate dissolution for a finite @xmath75 . in the previous section we assumed @xmath99 ,",
    "so the precipitate never dissolved . in this section",
    "we relax this assumption and look at the phase coexistence .",
    "let us first investigate the effect of @xmath75 on the phase coexistence .",
    "in order to simplify the presentation let us assume that the salt volume fractions in the polymer - rich and polymer - poor phases are the same .",
    "thus we treat @xmath103 as a parameter and obtain the coexisting polymer concentrations by constructing a common tangent to the equilibrium free energy density @xmath131 .",
    "an example of resulting phase diagrams for varying @xmath75 is shown in figure 4 ( the values of all parameters are given in the plot ) .",
    "the area below the coexistence line ( for a given @xmath75 ) corresponds to phase separation ( complexation at low salt concentrations ) , above  to a homogeneous solution ( the precipitate dissolves at high salt @xmath103 ) .",
    "owing to our simplifying assumption of equal @xmath103 in the two phases , the tie lines giving the coexisting polymer concentrations  are parallel to the @xmath98-axis .",
    "we see that the dilute phase has negligible polymer concentration even for rather small @xmath75 , which justifies the assumption @xmath132 of the previous section . when enough salt is added to the solution the precipitate dissolves .",
    "as we can see from figure 4 the salt concentration needed to dissolve the precipitate strongly depends on @xmath75 and ( as figures 1 and 2 show ) it also depends on @xmath92 and @xmath116 .    in figure 5",
    "we determine the conditions on @xmath92 , @xmath116 , and @xmath75 ensuring stability of the precipitate at a given concentration of salt . for each curve ( corresponding to a certain @xmath116 ) the precipitate exists at @xmath133",
    "if the values of @xmath92 and @xmath116 lie in the area above the curve , and the precipitate is dissolved in the area below the curve .",
    "( the value @xmath134 is taken as an example and it applies to all curves ) .",
    "the increase of either of @xmath92 , @xmath116 , or @xmath75 stabilizes the complex to addition of salt .",
    "we observe that  the stability of the precipitate is quite sensitive to the values of parameters in the experimentally most relevant region @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 @xmath138 .",
    "the results of figure 5 can be used for experimental design of complexes stable to salt .",
    "we obtained figure 5 by considering the spinodal stability of our two component system .",
    "the spinodal points are found from the following equation@xmath139with @xmath140 being the reduced equilibrium free energy . in figure 5 in the area above the curve for a certain @xmath116",
    "the equation @xmath141 has two solutions , while in the area below the curve it has no solutions for physical values of @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noted that in our two component system this condition on the existence of spinodal at a given salt is strictly speaking not equivalent to existence of phase separation ( to demand that the critical point be at @xmath142 is yet another different condition ) .",
    "however , in the considered system dissolution occurs at very low @xmath98 ,  so the three conditions yield numerically close results .",
    "complexation in solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can be accompanied by thermoreversible crosslinking of oppositely charged monomeric ions .",
    "a local electrostatic binding energy can exist between oppositely charged units when they tend to be dehydrated in the vicinity of each other or due to non - classical specific interactions . in this work",
    "we have investigated how the three different mechanisms ( long - range electrostatics , crosslinking and backbone hydrophobicity ) define the properties of polyelectrolyte complexes at different salt concentrations .    in our approach",
    "we obtain self - consistently the fraction of crosslinked charged monomers ( conversion ) and the debye - hckel collective fluctuations contribution to the free energy ( which depends on conversion ) .",
    "accordingly , the degree of conversion is determined both by the local binding energy and  by long - range electrostatics .",
    "we find that the long - range charge fluctuations always promote crosslinking .",
    "given that the magnitude of the debye - hckel contribution decreases with increasing salt , the fraction of crosslinked monomers also monotonically decreases with increasing salt .",
    "the polymer concentration in the precipitate is largest at low salt concentration , when the screening of interactions between monomeric ions is weakest .",
    "the complex concentration generally decreases monotonically with increasing salt concentration .",
    "the rate of complex dilution with addition of salt and the concentration of monomers in the precipitate at high salt are strongly dependent on the value of the van der waals attractions and on the binding energy .",
    "non - selective net van der waals attraction between the monomers of both the positively and negatively charged chains enhances the complexation in a way broadly similar to crosslinking due to local binding energy .",
    "the dilution is very rapid and the monomer concentration of the complex goes to zero in the case of zero binding energy and zero net van der waals attraction ( good solvent condition ) .",
    "instead , for large values of either type of the short - range attractions , as the salt concentration increases the monomer concentration in the complex generally nearly saturates to a nonzero constant value ( or slightly increases for sufficiently large @xmath116 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with experimental observations@xcite in which , depending on the type of polymers used , with the addition of salt the complexes can either dissolve , or their density can remain stable . in some cases",
    "initial dissolution and subsequent re - entrant precipitation is observed@xcite , the type of behavior obtained in our theory for marginal solvent",
    ".    there is an important competition between complexation due to charge fluctuations and non - linear thermoreversible linking , which is especially interesting in good solvent conditions",
    ". unassociated charged monomeric groups induce complexation due to long - range electrostatics . however , once they form crosslinks they practically do not contribute to long - range attraction .",
    "therefore at high conversion rates complexation is mostly due to effective crosslinking attraction in an effectively neutral polymer solution .",
    "this competition leads to an interesting non - monotonic behavior of monomer concentration in the precipitate with increasing the non - linear binding energy in the case of zero salt concentration : with the increasing binding energy the monomer concentration in the precipitate passes through a minimum .",
    "remarkably , the variation in the complex density is rather small , that is , crosslinking and long - range electrostatic attractions give rise to complexes of similar density .",
    "another important effect in polyelectrolyte complexation is the difference in salt concentration inside and outside the precipitate .",
    "when the non - linear binding energy is small the difference in salt concentration in and out of the precipitate is negligible .",
    "however , for large binding energies ( or large values of @xmath116 ) this difference rapidly grows as the overall salt concentration increases , the precipitate being depleted of salt due to increasing importance of hardcore interactions.@xcite we find that for large binding energies and/or in a bad solvent the difference between salt concentrations in the complex and in the bulk has a significant effect on the density of the complex at high salt concentrations .",
    "an interesting limit to analyze includes the addition of non - linear correlations among the ion pairs when the fraction of charged units increases as in the case of strongly charged chains in oppositely charged multivalent ion solution@xcite where even denser precipitates are expected .    *",

    "the autocorrelation function @xmath175 can be written as the following series@xmath176here , the first term is the sum of all diagrams in which the two labels belong to the same chain .",
    "next terms result from summation of all diagrams with labels belonging to different chains . in our model only oppositely charged chains can associate with each other .",
