    "@xcite reported the discovery of a strong emission band , centered ( as it then seemed ) at 21@xmath0 m , in the spectra of four carbon - rich protoplanetary nebuale ( ) taken by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "the feature was not resolved well with the low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) , but nevertheless , it was evident already from the lrs observations that it has a considerable strength in some objects ( especially iras 07134 + 1005 ) and is too broad ( full width at half maximum @xmath22@xmath0 m ) to originate from any atomic transition . the pioneering work by kwok , volk & hrivnak also highlighted the fact that the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature only occurs in a short transitional phase of stellar evolution , i.e.  in a very limited range of physical and chemical conditions .",
    "any identification of the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature has to cope with this fact .",
    "observations of selected with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) by @xcite brought substantial progress , especially concerning the position and width of the feature , which was shown to be 20.1@xmath0 m instead of 21@xmath0 m ( notwithstandig , the feature is still being refered to as ` 21'@xmath0 m band , a tradition to which we also stick in this paper ) .",
    "hrivnak , volk & kwok ( 2000 ) analysed iso observations at 2 - 45@xmath0 m for seven and two other carbon - rich objects .",
    "six of the sources exhibit emission features at 21 and 30@xmath0 m .",
    "the authors resolved the 30@xmath0 m band into a broad feature peaking at 27.2@xmath0 m ( the ` 30'@xmath0 m feature ) and a narrower feature at 25.5@xmath0 m ( the ` 26'@xmath0 m feature ) .",
    "the observations suggest that the sources with ` 21'@xmath0 m feature do also show the 30@xmath0 m feature .",
    "the ` 26'@xmath0 m feature appears to be present in a broader range of objects  carbon stars , , and possibly pne  than does the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature .",
    "the candidate carriers of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band have since its discovery been the matter of a long discussion .",
    "cox ( 1990 ) presented iras - lrs - spectra of ten hii regions which showed a peak close to 21@xmath0 m .",
    "he associated this peak with the feature discovered by kwok , volk & hrivnak and tentatively assigned it to iron oxides with the stoichiometries @xmath3-fe@xmath1o@xmath4 and fe@xmath4o@xmath5 . in the late 1990s ,",
    "some of these hii regions have also been observed with iso ; in the iso spectra , however , we do not find any traces of a broad 21 or 20@xmath0 m emission band ( in accordance with oudmaijer & de winter ( 1995 ) , who already cast doubt on cox observations ) .",
    "@xcite , still on the basis of iras spectra , assigned the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature to silicon disulfide ( sis@xmath1 ) , which has indeed an intense vibrational band in the 20@xmath0 m spectral range ( but , unfortunately , a second one which is not observed ; see below , sect .  [ disc ] ) . from a chemical point of view , other sulfur compounds like s@xmath6 , ocs , s@xmath1 and cs@xmath1 , even though mainly as mantles of other grains , were also taken into account by goebel as potential emitters in the 20@xmath0 m region .",
    "@xcite brought fulleranes as potential carriers of the ` 21 ' @xmath0 m feature into the discussion .",
    "@xcite , having studied the ir bands of terrestrial nitrogen - doped and neutron - irradiated diamonds , showed that defects in diamond structures can cause an emission band at 20@xmath722@xmath0 m and even stronger bands in the 810@xmath0 m region .",
    "however , there is a significant discrepancy between the position of 2122@xmath0 m and the actual position of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band as determined by recent observations .",
    "@xcite calculated synthetic spectra of carbonaceous macromolecules containing oh , oxygen , sulfur , nitrogen or a combination of them and found that it is possible to reproduce not only the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature , but also the 3.3 , 11.3 , 12 + , 26 and 30@xmath0 m bands by emissions of such molecules . according to this scenario , the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature would arise from out - of - plane vibrations of oxygen or nitrogen atoms in 5-membered carbon rings .",
    "papoular s approach seems promising because it aims at an identification of _ all _ the major features detected in the sources of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band on the basis of _ one _ unified dust model .",
    "but at the time being , substantial problems remain , such as the unsatisfactory reproduction of the observed 2635@xmath0 m band profile .",
    "there are various other papers discussing carbonaceous materials as carriers of the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature , but without any detailed fits of its average profile .",
    "@xcite suggested amides , especially urea , as potential carrier , @xcite and @xcite suggested polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and @xcite hydrogenated amorphous carbon .",
    "von helden et al .  ( 2000 ) came up with another suggestion , attributing the 20.1@xmath0 m feature to titanium carbide clusters ( made of 27 to 125 atoms ) .",
    "spectra of bulk titanium carbide and tic particles as those subsequently published by @xcite and @xcite show no band in the respective wavelength region , but rather weak bands at 9.5 , 12.5 ( kimura & kaito 2003 ) and 19@xmath0 m ( henning & mutschke 2001 ; see also speck & hofmeister 2004 ) .",
    "this does not contradict the measurements by @xcite , however , since clusters are likely to have electronic and vibrational properties deviating from those of bulk material even if composition and crystal structure are similar .",
    "notwithstanding , in 2003 , three papers doubting the ` tic - cluster - identification ' with substantial arguments came out , all based essentially on arguments concerning the abundance of titanium ( hony et al .",
    "2003 , chigai et al.2003 , and li 2003 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that tic , like any kind of dust , can only emit as much in the infrared as it absorbs in the uv and visual range . assigning a simple model opacity to tic at short wavelengths , hony et al .  found that this energy balance can be fulfilled only if unrealistically large amounts of tic are predicted to form in carbon - rich .",
    "this point was strengthened by @xcite by applying a sum - rule based on kramers - kronig considerations on the wavelength - integrated absorptivity .",
    "@xcite came to the same result , comparing the number densities of sic and tic grains necessary for producing the 11@xmath0 m and 21@xmath0 m features , respectively , with the available si and ti abundances .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the experimental finding that silicon carbide , under certain circumstances , does not only show the well - known resonance feature at 11@xmath0 m , but also a secondary band ( not predicted by group theory ) , which is centered at 2021@xmath0 m .",
    "this secondary band is reported to appear only in the @xmath8-sic - polytype , and nitrogen or carbon impurities were suspected by the authors to favour its occurence .",
    "maybe n- or c - doped @xmath8-sic - dust ( with temperatures around 100k ) would then , according to speck & hofmeister , emit at 2021@xmath0 m ( depending on particle size and shape ) even more effectively than at 11@xmath0 m , since the latter peak would still be in the wien regime of the corresponding planck function .",
    "important as this suggestion might be for the identification of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band , it is not beyond any doubt , as we try to show in  3 .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we summarize the currently available astronomical information on the sources in which the enigmatic ` 21'@xmath0 m band is observed .",
    " 3 presents new insights to the infrared properties of materials which should , despite some problems , _ not _ be excluded as feature carriers  such as core - mantle particles composed of sic and sio@xmath1 and cold feo dust grains . in  4 ,",
    "we deliver additional arguments for ruling out potential carriers of this band which have been ruled out more or less convincingly by other authors .",
    "the last section (  5 ) summarizes our conclusions .",
    "so far , the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature is observed only in emission , only in objects with a c / o - ratio close to or greater than unity and only in _",
    "cool _ dusty environments , i.e.  environments with dust temperatures below 250k . among them",
    "are the already mentioned c - rich ( about half of them show the feature ) , two planetary nebulae @xcite with central stars of the wolf - rayet type and , according to @xcite , two extreme carbon stars ( iras 21318 + 5631 , iras 06582 + 1507 ) . @xcite , however , re - analyzing the iso - spectrum of iras 21318 + 5631 , find no evidence for a feature at 20@xmath0 m , and in the case of iras 06582 + 1507 , @xcite also remark that its reality is doubtful .    it should be noted that an emission band with a position and width quite comparable to the ` 21'@xmath0 m band is detected in the spectra of stars on the _ early _ asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , i.e.  at the very opposite end of agb evolution : the 19.5@xmath0 m feature @xcite .",
    "its peak position amounts to 19.419.6@xmath0 m , its profile is symmetric and its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is close to 3@xmath0 m .",
    "the dust shells of the mostly semiregular variable stars in which this feature is observed are generally assumed to consist of refractory oxides , but not at all of carbonaceous dust grains",
    ". a solid solution of feo and mgo has been proposed as feature carrier in this case ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "coming back to the exhibiting the 21@xmath0 m band in its ` canonical ' form , let us consider the spectrum and the derived properties of its best - known source , iras 07134 + 1005 ( = sao 96709 or hd 56126 , see fig .",
    "[ iso1 ] ) .",
    "the f5 i central star of this ppn has a surface temperature of about 7000k according to @xcite ; other sources of the same feature have comparable effective temperatures ( 5500 to 8000k ) .",
    "the circumstellar envelopes of these objects are all _ optically thin _ at infrared wavelengths . as for unusual properties of the central stars , @xcite found them to be enriched in s - process elements and metal - poor .",
    "apart from the peak due to the radiation of the central star at visual wavelengths , several infrared bands arising from dust grains are present in the spectrum of hd 56126 , namely at 8 , 11.3 , 12.1 , and 30@xmath0 m .",
    "they are partly unidentified , partly attributed to sic ( 11.3broad component ) , pahs ( 11.3narrow component , 12 + ) and magnesium sulfide ( 30@xmath0 m ) , respectively .",
    "no silicate features are seen in any of the sources of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band .",
    "we derived the profile of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band using the polynomial subtraction method which has been applied by @xcite for the derivation of the 13@xmath0 m band profile .",
    "the residual emission of hd 56126 , based on an iso - sws - spectrum reduced with the iso spectral analysis package ( isap ) , is shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ iso1 ] . for comparison ,",
    "the scaled residual emission of sao 34504  calculated by the same method  is shown in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ iso1 ] as well ( open triangles ) .",
    "the close coincidence of the two emission profiles is noteworthy ; together with the result by @xcite that the feature profile is pretty much the same in all sources , this implies that the spectrum of hd 56126 can be considered representative and will be so considered in the following .",
    "the most conspicuous properties of the feature profile are a steep rise in its blue wing , a maximum position of 20.1@xmath0 m and a long ` tail ' extending to 2324@xmath0 m .",
    "in contrast to stars on the early agb , bright have spatial extensions which are large enough to resolve them even at infrared wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite tried to answer the question whether the different broad infrared features of have their origin in different or coincident regions on the basis of imaging through broad filters .",
    "they came to the conclusion that the 11.3@xmath0 m sic , the 12+@xmath0 m plateau emission , and the ` 21'@xmath0 m emission originate ( approximately ) in the same region , which seems to indicate that similar physical and chemical conditions are required for the formation and/or survival of the respective feature carrier .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , @xcite suggested silicon carbide with impurities as carrier both of the 11.3 and the ` 21'@xmath0 m spectral features .",
    "one of their arguments in favour of this hypothesis is the spatial co - location of both emission bands in some of the objects exhibiting them .",
    "obviously , this argument is applicable not only to n - doped and c - doped sic , but also to any other particular sic grain population like e.g.  oxidized sic grains ( see below ) .    in the following , when using the term ` silicon carbide ' or ` sic '",
    ", we will always refer to the cubic ( beta ) modification of this polymorphous solid .",
    "due to its symmetry , @xmath8-sic has only one predicted infrared active mode , which is located at 796@xmath9 ( position of the maximum of @xmath10 ) , producing , in the case of small spherical particles , a maximum of its absorption efficiency factor at 935@xmath9 or 10.7@xmath0 m .",
    "( for elongated ellipsoidal particles , this maximum of the absorption efficiency is shifted towards longer wavelengths : see mutschke et al .",
    "1999 and below . )",
    "as already explained , secondary emission bands of sic can occur in the case of a non - ideal crystal structure , e.g.  due to carbon or nitrogen inclusions .",
    "the case for n - doped sic , for which speck & hofmeister refer to @xcite , is problematic , however , since suttrop et al .",
    "did not only detect a 20.9@xmath0 m ( 478@xmath9 ) band , but also stronger additional bands in n - doped sic .",
    "these additional bands ( e.g.  at 667@xmath9 ( 15@xmath0 m ) and 580@xmath9 ( 17.2@xmath0 m ) ) are not seen in the sources of the astronomical ` 21'@xmath0 m feature . moreover , the whole series of nitrogen - induced secondary features of sic is weaker than the sic main feature at least by a factor of 1000",
    ". therefore , very low temperatures ( below 80k ) would be necessary to reverse this ratio of band strenghts . according to @xcite , the dust temperatures at the _ inner _ radii of the dust shells of the ` 21'@xmath0 m sources are between 165 and 220k ; due to the relatively small ratio between outer and inner shell radius , the _ average _ temperature of the dust grains producing the ` 21'@xmath0 m will hardly be below 80k even for very transparent dust species ( see below , fig .",
    "[ tr - det ] ) .    as for c - doped sic , there is presently too little information at hand about its potential secondary bands .",
    "as long as no studies on analytically well - characterized sic samples with carbon impurities are available , it remains unclear whether or not the properties of n - doped sic can be extrapolated to c - doped sic .",
    "interestingly , there is yet another possibility to produce an 11 plus a ` 21'@xmath0 m band by , so to speak , ` sic plus something ' : namely by coating sic grains with sio@xmath11 .",
    "recently performed experiments @xcite demonstrate that pure sic nanoparticles , under the influence of the laboratory atmosphere , are quite easily oxidized at their surfaces .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ lab - sic ] , where we compare the transmittance of sio@xmath1 grains with the transmittance of partially oxidized sic nanoparticles ( both embedded in kbr ) .",
    "the method for the production of sic nanoparticles by laser pyrolysis and the infrared spectra of these grains have been discussed extensively by @xcite .",
    "they also report the detection of an amorphous silicon oxide mantle by means of transmission electron microscopy ( see fig .",
    "[ tem ] ) . the large surface - to - volume ratio of the sic core favours the formation and growth of a silicon oxide mantle , which can be a few nanometers thick and thus reach a considerable volume fraction of the particulate .",
    "further evidence for the formation of sio@xmath1 on sic surfaces , has been delivered  even though for significantly higher temperatures  by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "depending on the particle size and shape as well as agglomeration effects , sic nanoparticles show one strong ir resonance band , located at 10.812.4@xmath0 m . however , if partially oxidized at their surfaces , the sic nanograins produce additional infrared bands at 9 and 2122@xmath0 m .",
    "these bands can be assigned to stretching and bending vibrations of the sio@xmath5 tetrahedra .",
    "the minor 12.5@xmath0 m band of sio@xmath1 is not detected in the spectrum of partially oxidized sic nanoparticles , since it almost coincides with the sic main band shifted to longer wavelengths by shape effects .",
    "an additional proof for the oxidation of sic is delivered by treating the oxidized grains with hf , which quickly reduces the oxidized grains , leaving only the pure silicon carbide cores . the spectroscopic result of this process is depicted in fig .  [ hf - sic ] .",
    "not only experimentally , but also by calculating the absorption efficiency of core - mantle - particles composed of sic and amorphous sio@xmath1 , absorption spectra with the principal structure of those shown in figs .",
    "[ lab - sic ] and [ hf - sic ] can be derived . for this purpose ,",
    "the optical constants of amorphous sio@xmath1 compiled in the first volume of @xcite have been used .",
    "we performed a lorentz fit to these optical constants in order to analyse the underlying oscillator parameters .",
    "the damping constants of the sic oscillator has been set to 50@xmath9 and that of the 456@xmath9 oscillator of sio@xmath1 to 42 ( instead of 27 ) , assuming that the nanocrystalline structure is comparable to that of defect - bearing polycrystalline films ( see @xcite , sect .",
    "2.3 ) . as for the 456@xmath9 sio@xmath1 oscillator , a larger damping constant",
    "than that corresponding to the palik data is justifyable also on the basis of the spectra published by @xcite .",
    "these authors studied the transmittance of thin sio@xmath12 films ( with x@xmath132 ) and found a strong broadening of the 2021@xmath0 m band with decreasing x. this result is of potential relevance for the coating of sic by silicon oxide in carbon - rich circumstellar shells , since in these environments , the formation of oxygen - deficient sio@xmath1 is very well conceivable . for a summary of all lorentz parameters used , see tab",
    "[ lor1 ] .",
    ".frequencies ( @xmath14 ) , oscillator strengths ( @xmath15 ) and damping constants ( @xmath16 ) of sic and sio@xmath1 .",
    "we adopted the values @xmath17 for sic and @xmath18 for amorphous sio@xmath1 .",
    "[ lor1 ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ sicsio ] shows the absorption efficiency factor q@xmath19/a of spherical core - mantle - particles composed of sic and amorphous sio@xmath1 with core volume fractions ranging from 40% to 60% .",
    "three prominent maxima of q@xmath19 are discernible : a peak at 8.3@xmath0 m , which originates from the sio@xmath1 mantle ; the sharp 11@xmath0 m sic resonance ; and , finally , a 20@xmath0 m peak , with a main peak and a shoulder at the long - wavelength side , originating again from the sio@xmath1 mantle .",
    "peak splitting is typical for bands of mantle materials .",
    "it arises from the existence of two interfaces with core and ambient medium .",
    "all the bands are sharper than those of the transmission spectrum of partially oxidized sic shown in fig .",
    "[ lab - sic ] .",
    "this difference in the bandwidth is primarily due to shape effects .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ sicsio ] , one may assume that the depicted pattern of c@xmath19/v maxima is incompatible with the spectra of astronomical objects like hd 56126 , since the 20@xmath0 m band , in this figure , is only a minor peak compared to those at 8.2 and 11@xmath0 m .",
    "however , such a conclusion would be premature given that the dust in the sources of the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature is rather cold , as has been highlighted in sect .",
    "[ s : prop ] . for dust particles with temperatures below 150k , all features at wavelenghts smaller than @xmath2020@xmath0",
    "m are strongly attenuated , because they tend to be located in the wien regime of the corresponding planck functions .",
    "this effect , which was already noted by @xcite , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plsicsio ] .",
    "it is evident from this figure that cold core - mantle - particles composed of sic and amorphous sio@xmath1 do produce a strong 20@xmath0 m feature .",
    "there is a rather good agreement between the observed and the calculated band positions ( see also tab .  [ t : delta - tab ] for a quantitative assessment ) , and the weakness of the observed 11@xmath0 m feature can be explained by dust temperatures significantly lower than 160k on the average . there remains a problem , however , with the _ width _ and _ shape _ of the 20@xmath0 m band produced by sio@xmath1 .",
    "for spherical particles , the fwhm of the 20@xmath0 m sio@xmath1 emissivity maximum amounts to 1.9@xmath0 m , compared to an observed fwhm of 2.22.3@xmath0 m .",
    "furthermore , the shoulder at the ` red ' wing of the 20@xmath0 m sio@xmath1 feature has not been seen in the astronomical ` 21'@xmath0 m band .",
    "the bandwidth discrepancy can be overcome by a cde ; the shoulder at the ` red ' wing of the band , however , does not vanish in the cde case ( see fig .",
    "[ sicvs20my ] ) ; nor does it vanish by any particular ( realistic ) choice of the dust temperature or dust temperature distribution .      instead of growing on top of silicon carbide grains , sio@xmath21 may equally well form mantles on top of pure silicon particles . @xcite",
    "were the first to examine the spectra emerging from silicon grains with oxide coatings , focussing on the case of stochastically heated nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite proposed silicon nanoparticles as carriers of the so - called _ extended red emission _ observed in circumstellar environments ; however , this identification is still a matter of debate .",
    "the principal structure of the ir spectrum of si - sio@xmath1 core - mantle - grains is similar to that of sic - sio@xmath1 core - mantle - grains , except for the absence of the 11@xmath0 m band .",
    "in addition to the 8.2@xmath0 m and the 20@xmath0 m peaks , a rather strong 12.5@xmath0 m band appears in the si - sio@xmath1 absorption efficiency spectrum .",
    "the exact position @xmath22 of the 20@xmath0 m resonance depends on the volume fraction @xmath23 of the si core .",
    "@xmath22 increases from 19.7 to 19.8 @xmath0 m as @xmath23 decreases from 0.6 to 0.4 .    following the procedure that has been explained in the previous subsection , we folded the absorption efficiency of a si - sio@xmath1 core - mantle - grain with @xmath23=0.5 with two different planck curves b@xmath24(t@xmath25 ) . for the dust temperature , the two values t@xmath25=100k and",
    "t@xmath25=160k have been chosen .",
    "as for the 20@xmath0 m band , the result  plotted in fig .",
    "[ plsisio ]  strongly resembles the case of sic cores , which is not surprising , since the optical constants of the core have only a limited influence on the structure of those bands which are due primarily to the mantle .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that core - mantle particles composed of si and sio@xmath1 are more unlikely to be the carrier of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band than those composed of sic and sio@xmath1 , since it is questionable whether _ silicon _ grains can be formed in carbon - rich at all .      as mentioned in",
    " 1 , iron oxides have been considered as carriers of bands in the 2021@xmath0 m region by various authors already .",
    "it seems clear , though , that none of the ` higher ' iron oxides like fe@xmath1o@xmath4 or fe@xmath4o@xmath5 can survive in a reducing environment .",
    "iron monoxide ( feo , also called wustiteo with x=0.05  0.16 . ] ) , by contrast , may survive in a carbon - rich circumstellar shell .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the oxidation of metallic iron is a very efficient process provided that enough o@xmath1 molecules are present .",
    "the degree to which iron particles are oxidized depends on the physical conditions , inter alia on the temperature .",
    "the _ higher iron oxides _",
    "fe@xmath4o@xmath5 or fe@xmath1o@xmath4 become stable at higher temperatures ( see , e.g. , gail & sedlmayr 1998 ) . by contrast , as @xcite and @xcite pointed out , several monolayers of _ iron monoxide _ form very quickly on top of fe surfaces , even at low temperatures , since this process requires a negligible activation energy . in order to end up with dust grains composed essentially of feo ( instead of a large metallic iron core and a tiny feo mantle ) , the ( low - temperature-)oxidation of _ very small _ iron grains is required ",
    "i.e.  grains composed of 10@xmath26 atoms at maximum . only such small iron grains ",
    "their diameter amounts to @xmath202 nm  could be fully converted into feo by the process mentioned above .",
    "the oxidation of iron grains consisting of less than 10@xmath26 atoms is to some extent an artificial assumption ; less artificial , though , than the constraint that the tic clusters  which have previously been considered as carriers of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band  should consist of no more than 125 atoms to efficiently produce the tic cluster signature .",
    "why would feo , according to our suggestion , not exist in the vast majority of the pne , at least not with high number densities ?",
    "a plausible explanation is that in pne with their large fractional ionization and high uv photon densities , iron oxides will be reduced to metallic iron .",
    "while the non - detection of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band in pne spectra can thus be accounted for , its non - detection in the spectra of most of the oxygen - rich as well as carbon - rich agb stars is more difficult to understand within the iron grain oxidation scenario for ppne . if in ppne like hd 56126 , feo forms by oxidation of iron , why does the same process not take place in c - stars , s - stars and in the vast majority of m - agb stars ? this may be due to the fact that the dust around these stars is , on the average , much hotter than dust in ppne and that the sticking probability of oxygen on iron decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "the mg - fe - oxide formation around some m - stars , postulated by @xcite , must involve an entirely different mechanism than the low - temperature oxidation of iron in ppne .",
    "indeed , @xcite predict mg - fe - oxides via the condensation of the very refractory mgo in m - stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that hd 56126 and other sources of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band studied by @xcite are depleted in metals including iron .",
    "other ppne do not show the feature , even though more iron is available for feo formation",
    ". there could be two reasons for that .",
    "one is that the iron particles should be small as stated above .",
    "the second is that feo formation is essentially governed by oxygen availability and that the iron abundance is therefore only crucial if there is enough free oxygen .    whereas the knowledge on the fe - mg - oxide formation in circumstellar environments is still scarce , quite detailed _ spectroscopic _ information on mg - fe - oxides is available .",
    "the optical constants of fe@xmath12mg@xmath27o samples ( x amounting to 0.4  1.0 ) with magnesiowustite structure have been measured at room temperature by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite published _ low temperature data _ for various cosmic dust analogs , i.e.   their indices of refraction n(@xmath28 ) and absorption k(@xmath28 ) for t=10 , 100 , 200 and 300k .",
    "a major change of the infrared spectrum of fe@xmath12mg@xmath27o is observed as the samples are cooled : namely a sharpening of the vibration band located at 1820@xmath0 m ( depending on @xmath29 ) .",
    "[ feotemp ] shows this effect for @xmath29=1.0 , i.e.  for pure feo .",
    "( the case t=10k has been omitted , since it does sot significantly differ from t=100k . )",

    "consequently , there is also a general upper limit to the energy emitted in the 21@xmath0 m band per unit particle mass or , vice versa , a minimum total grain volume for a certain total energy emitted through this band .",
    "hence , the minimum mass derived by li can be adopted to other materials just by scaling with the mass density of the grain material .",
    "this leads to the following conclusion concerning the abundance problem : while there is , according to li ( 2003 ) , about 100 times too little amount of titanium to account for the 21@xmath0 m band by assigning it to tic , there is 2.5 times more fe than would be needed to account for the 21 micron band with feo ( fe is 250 times more abundant than ti in hd 56126 ) .",

    "very low dust temperatures ( significantly below 100k ) would be required to make the @xmath2017@xmath0 m band negligible in strength compared to the @xmath2020@xmath0 m sis@xmath1 band .",

    "as for the individual groups of feature carriers , our arguments are the following ones :    \\1 ) dust and macromolecular species which produce a 2022@xmath0 m emission by transitions involving heteroatoms in carbonaceous networks ( e.g.  papoular 2000 ) , are not likely to be the feature carrier due to the uniqueness of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band profile on the one hand and the non - uniqueness of the heteroatom - caused emission bands on the other hand .",
    "\\2 ) there do exist oxide dust species which can produce a 20.1@xmath0 m emission band very effectively ( if the question of their formation in c - rich environments is left aside ) .",
    "as we have shown , this holds true both for cold feo and for sio@xmath1 .",
    "iron monoxide has _ only _ one ir active mode , centered at 19.9@xmath0 m , which shows an exceptional narrowing at temperatures in the 200100k range . by contrast , amorphous sio@xmath1 has two strong ir active modes , one of them being centered at 20.5@xmath0 m .",
    "our laboratory experiments show that amorphous sio@xmath1 easily forms mantles on top of sic .",
    "core - mantle particles composed of sic and sio@xmath1 , if colder than 150k , emit mainly through the lower energy band of sio@xmath1 .",
    "thus they can in principle account for the ` 21'@xmath0 m band , even though the reproduction of the feature profile is not as good as in the case of cold feo .",
    "but there is a major problem with any scenario involving oxides as band carriers : the difficulty to explain how oxides can form or at least survive in carbon - rich .",
    "it is hardly conceivable that the carrier of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band is just a remnant of the oxygen - rich outflow phase of the respective former agb stars .",
    "the interval between the oxygen - rich phase and the carbon - rich ppn phase is too long as to account for a co - location , as proven for hd 56126 , of products of the c - rich and the o - rich phase .",
    "the remnants of the o - rich phase are expected to be located at least one order of magnitude further out on a radial scale than the products of the c - rich phase .",
    "how , then , can either sic be oxidized or feo form / survive in c - rich environments ?",
    "as for the first process , there are several studies showing that _ complete _ transformation of sic to sio@xmath1 occurs at temperatures above 700k ( e.g.  mendybaev et al .  2002 ,",
    "tang & bando 2003 ) ; provided that large defective surfaces as those of nanograins are available for the reaction , the formation of sio@xmath1 mantles on top of sic grains also takes place at room temperature as our laboratory experiments indicate ( see fig .",
    "[ tem ] ) . but",
    "why should this sio@xmath1 mantle formation take place preferentially in ppne with c / o ratios close to or larger than unity ?",
    "this question , unfortunately , has to remain open here . as for the hypothesis that feo is the carrier of the ` 21'@xmath0 m band , it would require the oxidation of fe to feo in cold circumstellar environments .",
    "it seems that metal - poor ppne like hd 56126  paradoxically , at the first glance ",
    "provide good conditions for feo formation , since this process requires the presence of small metallic iron grains .",
    "the _ absence _ of any feature attributable to feo in the vast majority of the planetary nebulae , on the other hand , could be accounted for by the fact that feo can persist only in a narrow range of equilibrium between oxidation ( to higher iron oxides ) and reduction ( to metallic iron ) .",
    "thus , in pne , feo is probably reduced to metallic iron .",
    "\\3 ) quantum size effects critically influence the optical properties of very small grains and clusters .",
    "phonon modes can shift when the lattice changes from ` infinite ' to finite size , and conductivity may be reduced . for the tic _ grainlets _ proposed as carriers , this means that a ` 21'@xmath0 m band would only occur for clusters and particles in a _ very narrow size range_. this makes it unlikely that there would be a sufficient number of tic particles in the to account for the observed band strength , given that the predicted ti abundance is not large enough and that mantling by amorphous carbon will reduce the band strength even further .",
    "\\4 ) any identification or ruling - out of a candidate carrier is strengthened if it does not only have one , _ but two or more observable infrared bands_. if these bands are seperated by @xmath5410@xmath0 m , the secondary bands may be suppressed by temperature effects .",
    "this is likely to occur for the 11@xmath0 m sic band expected to arise from the core - mantle particles mentioned above .",
    "however , in the case of sis@xmath1 , even temperatures in the order of 100k will not be sufficient to suppress the 16.8@xmath0 m secondary emission feature .",
    "the multiband identification problem also sets constraints on bands produced by impurities , because the impurity - induced bands are usually much weaker than the phonon bands of the respective matrix materials ( which provides a further argument against doped sic as the carrier of the 21@xmath0 m feature ) .",

    "<S> the origin of the so - called ` 21'@xmath0 m feature which is especially prominent in the spectra of some carbon - rich protoplanetary nebulae ( ) is the matter of a lively debate . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of potential band carriers have been presented and discarded within the past decade . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper gives an overview of the problems related to the hitherto proposed feature identifications , including the recently suggested candidate carrier silicon carbide . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the case for spectroscopically promising oxides .    </S>",
    "<S> sic is shown to produce a strong resonance band at 2021@xmath0 m if coated by a layer of silicon dioxide . at low temperatures , core - mantle particles composed of sic and amorphous sio@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> indeed have their strongest spectral signature at a position of 20.1@xmath0 m , which coincides with the position of the ` 21'@xmath0 m emission band .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical constants of another candidate carrier that has been relatively neglected so far  iron monoxide  are proven to permit a fairly accurate reproduction of the ` 21'@xmath0 m feature profile as well , especially when low - temperature measurements of the infrared properties of feo are taken into account . as candidate carrier of the ` 21'@xmath0 m emission band , </S>",
    "<S> feo has the advantage of being stable against further oxidation and reduction only in a narrow range of chemical and physical conditions , coinciding with the fact that the feature , too , is detected in a small group of objects only . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is unclear how feo should form or survive particularly in carbon - rich . </S>"
