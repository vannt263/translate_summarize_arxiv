    "paper studies time - slotted communications over networks consisting of nodes and directed edges that connect the nodes , and the networks may contain cycles . each edge receives a symbol from a node and outputs a symbol to a node in each time slot , where the duration of a time slot is set to be the maximum propagation delays experienced by the edges . in practical communication networks ,",
    "propagation delays of different links may vary significantly due to different distances and different transmission medium ( e.g. , optical fiber , air , water , etc . ) across different links .",
    "for example , links with relatively short distances have shorter propagation delays compared to those with relatively long distances , and links established through the optical fiber medium generally experience negligible propagation delays compared to links established through the water medium . in order to characterize the scenario where the propagation delays experienced by some edges are negligible compared to the delays experienced by the other edges",
    ", we allow the edges with negligible delays to be operated before the rest of the edges in each time slot .",
    "since the symbols transmitted on earlier - operated edges may depend on the symbols output from latter - operated edges , we say that an edge @xmath2 terminating at node  @xmath3 _ incurs zero delay _ on an edge @xmath1 originating from node  @xmath3 if  @xmath2 is operated before  @xmath1 ; otherwise , we say @xmath2 _ incurs a unit delay _ on @xmath1 .",

    "a well - known outer bound on the capacity region of the dmn that contains no zero - delay edge is the _ classical cut - set bound _",

    "consider a two - relay network ( trn ) illustrated in figure  [ 2relaynetwork ] , which consists of a source denoted by  @xmath4 , two relays denoted by  @xmath5 and  @xmath16 respectively , and a destination denoted by  @xmath17 .",

    "consequently , the capacity of the trn - cn with zero - delay edges is strictly larger than the classical cut - set bound , i.e. ,  @xmath30 .",

    "we call the trn described above the _ two - relay network with independent noises ( trn - in)_. it can be easily seen that the capacity of the trn - in , which is equal to the capacity of channel  @xmath35 specified in  , coincides with the cut - set bound even when zero - delay edges are present .      in this paper , we consider the multimessage multicast network ( mmn ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "18 ) consisting of independent channels , where the destination nodes want to decode the same set of messages transmitted by the source nodes .",
    "two simple examples of the mmn with independent channel are the following two networks introduced in section  [ sectionmotivating ]  the bsc - if ( where both nodes want to decode all the messages ) and the trn - in , which belong to the class of mmns consisting of independent discrete memoryless channels ( dmcs ) @xcite .",
    "note that the bsc - cf , unlike the bsc - if , does not belong to the class of mmns with independent dmcs because the forward and reverse channels of the bsc - cf are correlated ( cf .",
    "figure  [ bscfb](a ) ) .",
    "similarly , the trn - cn , unlike the trn - in , does not belong to the class of mmns with independent dmcs because the noises among the channels of the trn - cn are correlated ( cf .  figure  [ 2relaynetwork ] , , and ) .",
    "we propose an edge - delay model for the discrete memoryless mmn ( dm - mmn ) with independent channels and zero - delay edges .",
    "in our model , each channel is associated with a set of directed edges ( e.g. , a channel characterized by @xmath36 is associated with @xmath37 ) and the channels are operated in a predetermined order so that the output random variables generated by earlier - operated channels are available for encoding the input random variables for latter - operated channels . therefore , an edge may incur zero delay on another edge under our model .",
    "our edge - delay model can be used to investigate the practical situation when some edges with negligible propagation delays are allowed to be operated before the rest of the edges in each time slot ( for instance , in a cellular network , edges that connect the mobile users to their closest relays may experience negligible propagation delays compared to those that connect the relays to the base stations ) .",
    "the channels of the mmn are assumed to be _ independent _ , meaning that the outputs among the channels are independent given their inputs , but the outputs within a channel are allowed to correlate with each other .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is twofold : first , we establish an edge - delay model for the mmn consisting of independent channels which may contain zero - delay edges .",
    "our model subsumes the classical model which assumes that every edge incurs a unit delay on every adjacent edge .",
    "second , we prove that for each dm - mmn consisting of independent channels with zero - delay edges , the capacity region always lies within the classical cut - set bound despite a violation of the classical unit - delay assumption .",
    "combining our cut - set bound result with existing achievability results from network equivalence theory  @xcite and noisy network coding ( nnc )  @xcite , we establish the tightness of our cut - set bound under our edge - delay model for the mmn with independent dmcs , and hence fully characterize the capacity region . more specifically ,",
    "we show that the capacity region is the same as the set of achievable rate tuples under the classical unit - delay assumption . the capacity region result is then generalized to the mmn consisting of independent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels with zero - delay edges .    the mmn with independent dmcs has been investigated in  @xcite under the _ node - delay _ model proposed in  @xcite for general discrete memoryless networks .",
    "the precise definition of zero - delay nodes in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv ) can be expressed under our edge - delay model as follows : a node _ incurs no delay _ if and only if every incoming edge of the node incurs no delay on every outgoing edge of the node . in  @xcite",

    "all the outgoing edges of each zero - delay node must be operated simultaneously after all the incoming edges of the node have been operated ( cf .",
    "* definitions  1 and  2 ) ) while under our edge - delay model , the incoming and outgoing edges of a node can be operated in some predetermined order ( cf .  definition  [ deforderedpartition ] , [ defdiscretenetwork ] and  [ defchanneloperationsequence ] ) . for example",
    ", for the trn - cn described in section  [ subsectrn ] , edge  @xmath28 can be operated before edge  @xmath27 under our edge - delay model but not under the node - delay model . in this work ,",
    "we strengthen the main result in  @xcite under our edge - delay model for the mmn with independent dmcs and show that the capacity region remains unchanged even when zero - delay edges are present .",
    "it was shown by effros @xcite that under the positive - delay assumption is a function of @xmath38 . ] in the classical setting , the set of achievable rate tuples for the mmn with independent channels does not depend on the amount of positive delay incurred by each edge on each other edge .",
    "our capacity result for the mmn with independent dmcs ( as well as awgns ) complements effros s finding as follows : the set of achievable rate tuples for the mmn with independent dmcs ( as well as awgns ) does not depend on the amount of delay incurred by each edge on each other edge , even with the presence of zero - delay edges . from a practical point of view , the capacity region of the mmn with independent dmcs ( as well as awgns ) is not affected by the way of handling delays among the channels or how the channels are synchronized , even when zero - delay edges are present .",
