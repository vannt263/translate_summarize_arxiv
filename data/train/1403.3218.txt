    "nucleon ( @xmath2 ) and hyperon  hyperon ( @xmath3 ) interactions . + exotic forms of deeply bound objects with strangeness @xcite and later the h di - baryon @xcite was proposed by theory .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations suggest that the h - dibaryon is either a weakly bound system or a resonant state @xcite , and there could be strange di - baryon systems including @xmath4 s that can be bound @xcite .",
    "an experimental confirmation of such a state would therefore be an enormous advance in the understanding of the hyperon interaction . + hypernuclei are known to be produced in heavy ion collisions already for a long time @xcite , and the recent discoveries of the first anti - hypertriton @xcite and anti-@xmath5 @xcite has fueled the interest in the field of hypernuclear physics .",

    "the cluster is formed at , or shortly after , the ( chemical-)freeze out of the system .",
    "a general assumption is , that these clusters are then formed through coalescence of different newly produced hadrons @xcite . to estimate the production yield we compare two distinct approaches .",
    "first we use the hadronic transport model dcm @xcite to provide us with the phase space information of all hadrons produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "this information then serves as an input for a coalescence prescription @xcite .",
    "on the other hand it has been shown that thermal models consistently describe the production yields of hadrons ( and nuclei @xcite ) very well .",
    "we can therefore assume thermal production of clusters from a fluid dynamical description to heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "figures [ dibmidy ] and [ hypmidy ] show the results for di - baryon and hypernuclei yields in the mid - rapidity region of central , @xmath6 fm , heavy ion collisions at different beam energies . we compare results from the coalescence approach ( symbols ) with those from the fluid dynamical model ( solid lines ) .",
    "it is clearly visible that large and multi - strange nuclear clusters exhibit a production maximum at a lower beam energy of @xmath7 gev .",

    "<S> two in particular important aspects , the production of ( multi ) strange hypernuclei and the properties of heavy flavor mesons , are at the core of several future facilities and will be discussed in detail .    as strange quarks have to be newly produced during the hot and dense stage of a relativistic nuclear collision , they carry information , on the properties of the matter that was created @xcite , to the observed final particle state . </S>",

    "<S> recently several observables , regarding strange and charm quarks have shown the importance of understanding the dynamics of strangeness and charm production in heavy ion collisions :    * strange particle ratios and yields from the alice collaboration may indicate that there is either no unique chemical freeze out point for strange an non - strange particles @xcite , or the light quark phase space is severely over - saturated @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> viscous hydrodynamics , with fluctuating initial conditions @xcite and finite but small viscous corrections , seems to describe strange hadron observables even at large baryon densities @xcite . * the hydrodynamic model calculations show sensitivity on the life time of the system and the applied equation of state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> * there are indications that systems created in high energy p+p and p+pb collisions can thermalize / equilibrate to a certain degree and show signs of collectivity @xcite . * a polarization of @xmath0 s due to the finite angular momentum of the fireball </S>",
