    "depends on the shape of the fermi surface in rather subtle manner , and the model fermi surface used for the calculations @xcite may be too simple for a quantitatively correct description at low @xmath6 .",

    "an alternative method to obtain the anisotropy parameter @xmath75 of a superconductor , used often and with success in the case of cuprates @xcite , consists of measuring the torque , as a function of angle , well below @xmath0 , and analyzing the data with a formula developed by kogan @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the effective mass anisotropy , @xmath79 is the in - plane penetration depth , @xmath80 is the volume of the crystal , @xmath81 is the flux quantum , and @xmath82 is a constant of the order of unity depending on the vortex lattice structure . equation ( [ tau_rev ] ) is valid in the limits of fields @xmath83 and not too close to @xmath8 .",

    "when aglt is not applicable , the anisotropies of the penetration depth , @xmath97 , and of the upper critical field , @xmath2 , differ in general .",

    "field dependent point - contact spectroscopy @xcite and specific heat @xcite measurements indicate that the small gap disappears in fields of the order of @xmath99 , i.e. , superconductivity in the ( 3d ) @xmath100 fermi sheets is rapidly suppressed by even low fields , whereas it persists in the ( 2d ) @xmath101 sheets up to much higher fields .",
    "this should result in an increase of the effective ( bulk ) anisotropy with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "further studies are needed for a complete understanding of the detailed interplay of the effects described above .    in the `` unshaked '' torque data of crystals a and b , a pronounced peak in the irreversible torque for field alignments close to @xmath102 , was observed ( see , e.g. , upper inset of fig .  5 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is tempting to ascribe this feature , also observed by other authors @xcite , to `` intrinsic pinning '' , in analogy to observations on strongly anisotropic cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , the observation of such `` intrinsic pinning '' in mgb@xmath1 is rather counter - intuitive , since the `` intrinsic pinning '' is mostly determined by the ratio of the @xmath27-axis coherence length to the separation of the superconducting layers , which is much larger in mgb@xmath1 than in the case of cuprates in the region where `` intrinsic pinning '' is commonly observed by torque magnetometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent paradox is resolved by further measurements : torque measurements on crystal c with the same conditions show no sign of `` intrinsic '' pinning for @xmath102 @xcite , indicating the _ extrinsic _ origin of the feature .",
    "the most likely cause of the peak in the irreversible torque for @xmath102 is a small amount of stacking faults",
    ". it may indicate the presence of some stacking faults in crystals a and b , while they would seem to be absent in crystal c @xcite .",
    "in low @xmath8 superconductors , such as nbse@xmath1 , the order - disorder transition is signified experimentally by a peak effect ( pe ) in the critical current density @xcite .",

    "in summary , studying the anisotropic superconducting state properties of mgb@xmath1 revealed a strong temperature dependence of the upper critical field anisotropy @xmath2 , and indicated a difference of the anisotropies of the penetration depth and the upper critical field .",
    "these findings , which imply a breakdown of the standard form of the widely used anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory in mgb@xmath1 , can be explained by superconductivity in this compound involving two band systems of different dimensionality , in accordance with microscopic studies .",
    "a pronounced peak effect in the magnetic hysteresis is a signature of an `` order - disorder '' transition of vortex matter , similar to transitions in both high @xmath8 cuprate and low @xmath8 superconductors . despite the intermediate importance of thermal fluctuations in mgb@xmath1",
    ", the phase diagram resembles quite closely the one of the low @xmath8 superconductor nbse@xmath1 . on the other hand , chances of a proper identification of mainly",
    "thermally induced melting at higher temperatures are better in mgb@xmath1 , due to the increased thermal fluctuations .",
