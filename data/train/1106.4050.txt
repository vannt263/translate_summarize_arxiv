    "in the 30 years since its introduction , kingman s coalescent has become a fundamental tool in population genetics .",
    "it provides an elegant description of the genealogical trees relating individuals in a sample from a highly idealized biological population , in which it is assumed that all individuals are selectively neutral and experience identical conditions , and that population size is constant . spurred on by the flood of dna sequence data , theoreticians have successfully extended the classical coalescent to incorporate more realistic biological assumptions such as varying population size , natural selection and genetic structure .",
    "however , it has proved surprisingly difficult to produce satisfactory extensions for populations living ( as many do ) in continuous two - dimensional habitats  a problem dubbed _ the pain in the torus _ by felsenstein  @xcite .    in the classical models of population genetics , it is customary to assume that populations are either panmictic , meaning , in particular , that they have no spatial structure , or that they are subdivided into `` demes . ''",
    "the demes sit at the vertices of a graph which is chosen to caricature the geographic region in which the population resides .",
    "thus , for example , for a population living in a two - dimensional spatial continuum one typically takes the graph to be ( a subset of ) @xmath6 .",
    "reproduction takes place within demes and interaction between the subpopulations is through migration along the edges of the graph .",
    "models of this type are collectively known as stepping stone models .",
    "however , in order to apply a stepping stone model to populations that are distributed across continuous space , one is forced to make an artificial subdivision . moreover",
    ", the predictions of stepping stone models fail to match observed patterns of genetic variation . for example",
    ", they overestimate genetic diversity ( often by many orders of magnitude ) and they fail to predict the long - range correlations in allele frequencies seen in real populations .    in recent work @xcite we introduced a new framework in which to model populations evolving in a spatial continuum .",
    "the key idea , which enables us to overcome the pain in the torus , is that reproduction is driven by a poisson process of events which are based on geographical space rather than on individuals .",
    "this leads , in particular , to a class of models that could reasonably be called _",
    "continuum stepping stone models _ , but it also allows one to incorporate large - scale extinction / recolonization events .",
    "such events dominate the demographic history of many species .",
    "they appear in our framework as `` local population bottlenecks . '' in  @xcite , we show ( numerically ) how the inclusion of such events can lead to long - range correlations in allele frequencies . in",
    "@xcite a rigorous mathematical analysis of a class of models on a torus in @xmath7 illustrates the reduction in genetic diversity that can result from such large - scale demographic events .",
    "we expand further on this in section  [ subsibd ] .",
    "thus , large - scale events provide one plausible explanation of the two deficiencies of stepping stone models highlighted above , but of course they are not the only possible explanation .",
    "a natural question now arises : how could we infer the existence of these large - scale events from data ?",
    "one possible answer is through correlations in patterns of variation at different genetic loci .",
    "recall that in a diploid population ( in which chromosomes are carried in pairs ) correlations between linked genes ( i.e. , genes occurring on the same chromosome ) are broken down over time by recombination ( which results in two genes on the same chromosome being inherited from different chromosomes in the parent ) .",
    "we say that genes are _",
    "loosely _ linked , if the rate of recombination events is high [ e.g. , if the chance of a recombination in a single generation is @xmath8 . in the kingman coalescent , genealogies relating loosely linked genes evolve independently .",
    "this is because on the timescale of the coalescent , the states in which lineages ancestral to both loci are in the same individual vanish instantaneously .",
    "it is well known that if a population experiences a bottleneck , this is no longer the case . as we trace backward in time , when we reach the bottleneck , we expect to see a significant proportion of surviving lineages coalesce _ at the same time _",
    "and so we see correlations in genealogies even at _ unlinked _ loci . with local bottlenecks we can expect a rather more complicated picture .",
    "the degree of correlations across loci will depend upon the spatial separation of individuals in the sample .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the model of  @xcite to diploid populations , to incorporate recombination , and to provide a first rigorous analysis of the correlations in genealogies at different loci in the presence of local extinction / recolonization events .",
    "since the questions we shall address and some of the methods we shall use here are related to those of @xcite , the reader may find it useful to have some familiarity with the results of that paper .      in  @xcite",
    ", we introduced the _ spatial @xmath0-fleming  viot process _ as a model of a haploid population evolving in a spatial continuum .",
    "it is a markov process taking its values in the set of functions which associate to each point of the geographical space a probability measure on a compact space , @xmath9 , of genetic types .",
    "if @xmath10 is the current state of the population and @xmath11 is a spatial location , the measure @xmath12 can be interpreted as the distribution of the type of an individual sampled from location @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics are driven by a poisson point process of _ events_. an event specifies a spatial region , @xmath13 , say , and a number @xmath14 $ ] . as a result of the event",
    ", a proportion @xmath15 of individuals within @xmath13 are replaced by offspring of a parent sampled from a point picked uniformly at random from @xmath13 . in  @xcite the regions",
    "@xmath13 are chosen to be discs of random radius ( whose centers fall with intensity proportional to the lebesgue measure ) and the distribution of @xmath15 can depend on the radius of the disc . under appropriate conditions , existence and uniqueness in law of the process were established .    here",
    "we wish to extend this framework in a number of directions .",
    "first , whereas in  @xcite a single parent was chosen from the region @xmath13 , here we allow @xmath13 to be repopulated by the offspring of a finite ( random ) number of its inhabitants .",
    "second , we assume that the population is diploid . we shall follow ( neutral ) genes at two distinct ( linked ) loci , with recombination acting between them . writing @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the possible types at the two loci , the type of an individual is an element of @xmath18 ( which we can identify with @xmath19\\times[0,1]$ ] ) . as in  @xcite",
    ", we work on the torus @xmath1 of side @xmath2 in @xmath7 and we suppose that there are two types of events : small events , affecting regions of radius @xmath3 , which might be thought of as `` ordinary '' reproduction events ; and `` large '' events , representing extinction / recolonization events , affecting regions of radius @xmath20 where @xmath5 $ ] is a fixed parameter . in order to keep the notation as simple as possible ,",
    "we shall only allow two different radii for our events , @xmath21 corresponding to `` small '' reproduction events and @xmath22 corresponding to `` large '' local bottlenecks .",
    "we shall also suppose that the corresponding proportions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fixed .",
    "neither of these assumptions is essential to the results , which would carry over to the more general setting in which each of @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is sampled ( independently ) from given distributions each time an event occurs .",
    "let us specify the dynamics of the process more precisely .",

    "[ remarksonmodel ] ( 1 ) the scheme of choosing @xmath48 parental locations and then sampling a parental type at each of those locations is convenient when one is interested in tracing lineages ancestral to a sample from the population .",
    "it can be thought of as sampling @xmath48 individuals , uniformly at random from the ball affected by the reproduction ( or extinction / recolonization ) event , to reproduce .",
    "of course this scheme allows for the possibility of more than one parent contributing offspring so that we should more correctly call this model a spatial @xmath64-fleming  viot process , but to emphasize the close link with previous work we shall abuse terminology and use the name @xmath0-fleming  viot process .",
    "the recombination scheme mirrors that generally employed in moran models . the quantity @xmath65 is the proportion of offspring who , as a result of recombination , inherit the types at the two loci from different parental chromosomes . we have chosen to sample the types of those two chromosomes from different points in space . the result of this",
    "is that provided the individuals sampled from the current population are in distinct geographic locations , if two ancestral lineages are at spatial distance zero , then they are necessarily in the same individual .",
    "this is mathematically convenient ( cf .",
    "remark  [ remmarkovproperty ] ) but , arguably , not terribly natural biologically .",
    "however , changing the sampling scheme , for example , so that the two recombining chromosomes are sampled from the same location , would not materially change our results .",
    "we are assuming that recolonization is so rapid after an extinction event that the effects of recombination during recolonization are negligible .",
    "since @xmath1 is compact , the overall rate at which events fall is finite for any  @xmath2 and the corresponding _",
    "spatial @xmath0-fleming  viot process with recombination _ is well - defined . notice that a given site , @xmath11 , say , is affected by a small event at rate @xmath66 ( since the center of the event must fall within a distance @xmath21 of  @xmath11 ) , whereas it is hit by a large event at rate @xmath67 .",
    "so reproduction events are frequent , but massive extinction / recolonization events are rare .",
    "having established the ( forward in time ) dynamics of allele frequencies in our model , we now turn to the genealogical relationships between individuals in a sample from the population .",
    "first suppose that we are tracing the lineage ancestral to a single locus on a chromosome carried by just one individual in the current population .",
    "recombination does not affect us and we see that the lineage will move in a series of jumps : if its current location is @xmath68 , then it will jump to @xmath69 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath70 ) due to a small ( resp . ,",
    "large ) event with respective intensities @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the volume of the intersection @xmath73 [ viewed as a subset of @xmath1 for the first intensity measure , and of @xmath74 for the second ] . to see this ,",
    "note first that by translation invariance of the model we may suppose that @xmath75 . in order for the lineage to experience a small jump , say , from the origin to @xmath11 , the origin and the position @xmath11 must be covered by the same event .",
    "this means that the center of the event must lie in both @xmath76 and @xmath47 .",
    "the rate at which such events occur is @xmath77 .",
    "the lineage will only jump if it is sampled from the portion @xmath23 of the population that are offspring of the event and then it will jump to the position of its parent , which is uniformly distributed on a ball of area @xmath78 . combining these observations",
    "gives the first intensity in  ( [ intensities ] ) .",
    "a lineage ancestral to a single locus in a single individual thus follows a compound poisson process on @xmath1 .",
    "suppose now that we sample a single individual , but trace back its ancestry at _ both _ loci .",
    "we start with a single lineage which moves , as above , in a series of jumps as long as it is in the fraction @xmath79 of `` nonrecombinants '' in the population . however , every time it is hit by a small event , there is a probability @xmath80 that it was created by recombination from two parental chromosomes , whose locations are sampled uniformly at random from the region affected by the event .",
    "if this happens , we must follow two distinct lineages , one for each locus , which jump around @xmath1 in an a priori correlated manner ( since they may be hit by the same events ) , until they coalesce again",
    ". this will happen if they are both affected by an event ( small or large ) and are both derived from the same parent ( which for a given event has probability @xmath81 in our notation above ) .",
    "thus , the ancestry of the two loci from our sampled individual is encoded in a system of splitting and coalescing lineages .",
    "if we now sample two individuals , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we represent their genealogical relations at the two loci by a process @xmath84 taking values in the set of partitions of @xmath85 whose blocks are labeled by an element of @xmath1 . as in  @xcite , at time @xmath86 each block of @xmath87 contains the labels of all the lineages having a common ancestor ( i.e. , carried by the same individual ) @xmath46 units of time in the past , and the mark of the block records the spatial location of this ancestor .",
    "the only difference with the ancestral process defined in  @xcite is that blocks can now split due to a recombination event .    of course",
    ", if @xmath65 is small , then the periods of time when the lineages are in a single individual , that is , during which they have coalesced and not split apart again , can be rather extensive .",
    "this has the potential to create strong correlations between the two loci .",
    "the other source of correlation is the large events which can cause coalescences between lineages even when they are geographically far apart . to gain an understanding of these correlations , we ask the following question :    _ the problem _ : given @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath65 , is there a minimal distance @xmath90 such that , asymptotically as @xmath35 ,    * if we sample two individuals @xmath82 and @xmath83 at distance at least @xmath90 from each other , then the coalescence time of the ancestral lineages of @xmath13 and @xmath91 is independent of that of the ancestral lineages of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( in other words , genealogies at the two loci are completely decorrelated ) ; * if two individuals are sampled at a distance less than @xmath90 , then the genealogies at the two loci are correlated ( i.e. , the lineages ancestral to @xmath13 and @xmath92 , and , similarly , those of @xmath91 and @xmath93 , remain sufficiently `` close together '' for a sufficiently long time that there is a significant chance that the coalescence of @xmath13 and @xmath91 implies that of  @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the same time or soon after ) ?      before stating our main results , we introduce some notation .",
    "we shall always denote the types of the two individuals in our sample by @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the same letters will be used to distinguish the corresponding ancestral lineages . as we briefly mentioned in the last section ,",
    "the genealogical relationships between the two loci at time @xmath94 before the present are represented by a marked partition of @xmath85 , in which each block corresponds to an individual in the ancestral population at time @xmath46 who carries lineages ancestral to our sample .",
    "the labels in the block are those of the corresponding lineages and the mark is the spatial location of the ancestor . for any such marked partition @xmath95 , we write @xmath96 for the probability measure under which the genealogical process starts from @xmath95 , with the understanding that marks then evolve on the torus @xmath1 .",
    "typically , our initial configuration will be of the form @xmath97 where the separation @xmath98 between the two sampled individuals will be assumed to be large .",
    "the coalescence times of the ancestral lineages at each locus are denoted by @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "finally , we write @xmath101 for the euclidean norm of @xmath102 ( or in a torus of any size ) and @xmath103 is a constant , whose value is given just after  ( [ defsigma ] ) .",
    "( it corresponds , after a suitable space ",
    "time rescaling , to the limit as @xmath35 of the variance of the displacement of a lineage during a time interval of length one . )    for later comparison , we first record the asymptotic behaviour of the coalescence time at a single locus .",

    "this tells us that the effect of recombination will be felt only if exactly one of the lineages ancestral to @xmath13 and  @xmath92 ( or to @xmath91 and @xmath93 ) is `` hit '' by a large event . since recombination events between @xmath13 and @xmath92 result in only a small separation of the corresponding ancestral lineages",

    "the same reasoning is valid when @xmath160 . in this case , although we may see some recombination events before any coalescence occurs , a closer look at the proof of proposition  [ propeffectiverecomb ] reveals that the time spent in distinct individuals by the two lineages ancestral to @xmath161 , say , in @xmath156 units of time , is negligible compared to @xmath89 .",
    "thus , with high probability , any large event affecting lineages ancestral to our sample will occur at a time when the lineages ancestral to @xmath13 and @xmath92 are in the same individual , ( as are those ancestral to @xmath91 and @xmath93 ) . as a result ,",

    "we are still unable to recover precise results .",
    "the reason is that even after such an event , we may be in a situation in which all lineages could be hit by the same large event , or at least remain at separations @xmath4 .",
    "but we shall see that a key to the proofs of theorems  [ theocorrelation ] and  [ theosemi - correl ] is the fact that , in the settings considered there , where individuals are sampled from far apart , whenever two lineages come to within @xmath164 of one another , the other ancestral lineages are still very far from them .",
    "this gives the pair time to merge without `` interference '' from the other lineages .",
    "since lineages at separations @xmath20 are correlated and their coalescence times depend strongly on their precise ( geographical ) paths on this scale , it is difficult to quantify the extent to which the fact that the ancestral lines of @xmath161 and of @xmath165 start within the same individuals makes the coalescence times @xmath99 and @xmath100 _ more _ correlated . nonetheless , this is an important question and will be addressed elsewhere .    to answer our initial question ,",
    "we see from theorems  [ theocorrelation ] and  [ theosemi - correl ] ( and the subsequent discussion ) that @xmath90 is informally given by @xmath166 when the sampling distance is greater than the radius of the largest events , correlated genealogies are only possible when recombination is slow enough , or large events occur rarely enough , that @xmath167 .",

    "thus , @xmath173 .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us make two remarks :    [ remrates ] recall that we imposed the condition @xmath174 .",
    "the reason for the upper bound is that in  @xcite , we showed that the coalescence of the ancestral lineages is then driven by the large events and , moreover , is very rapid once lineages are at separation @xmath4 ( see the proof of theorem  3.3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "similar results should hold , although on different timescales , in the other cases presented in  @xcite . however , to keep the presentation of our results as simple as possible , we have chosen to concentrate on this upper bound .",
    "the ( rather undemanding ) lower bound is needed in the proof of proposition  [ propdecorr ] .",
    "[ remindependence ] in these two theorems , we could also consider the probabilities of events of the form @xmath175 , with @xmath176 .",
    "however , they can be computed by a simple application of theorem  [ theocorrelation ] or  [ theosemi - correl ] at time @xmath46 , and the markov property .",
    "indeed , arguments similar to those of the proofs of lemma  [ lemc ] and lemma  [ lemmasep ] in section  [ section1locus ] tell us that the distance between lineages ancestral to  @xmath92 and @xmath93 at time @xmath140 , conditional on not having coalesced by this time , lies in @xmath177 $ ] .",

    "we prove proposition  [ prop1locus ] and collect several results on genealogies of a sample from a single locus that we shall need in the sequel .",
    "since most of these results are close to those established in  @xcite , or require techniques used in @xcite and @xcite for similar questions on the discrete torus , their proofs will only be sketched .",
    "our main results are proved in section  [ section2loci ] : we define an effective recombination rate in section  [ subseffectiverecomb ] , use it to find an upper bound on the time we must wait before the two lineages ancestral to @xmath13 and @xmath92 start to evolve independently in section  [ subsdecorrelation ] and finally derive the asymptotic coalescence times of our two pairs of lineages in section  [ subsproofs ] .",
    "in this section we expand on the biological motivation for our work .",
    "it has long been understood that for many models of spatially distributed populations , if individuals are sampled sufficiently far from one another , then the genealogical tree that records the relationships between the alleles carried by those individuals at a single locus is well - approximated by a kingman coalescent with an `` effective population size '' capturing the influence of the geographical structure .",
    "if the underlying population model is a stepping stone model , with the population residing in discrete demes located at the vertices of @xmath6 or @xmath178 , individuals reproducing within demes and migration modeled as a random walk , then the genealogical trees relating individuals in a finite sample from the population are traced out by a system of coalescing random walks .",
    "the case in which random walks coalesce instantly on meeting corresponds ( loosely ) to a single individual living in each deme in which case the stepping stone model reduces to the voter model . in this",
    "setting , and with symmetric nearest neighbour migration , convergence to the kingman coalescent as the separation of individuals in the initial sample tends to infinity was established for @xmath6 in  @xcite , and for @xmath178 in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "zhle , cox and durrett prove the same kind of convergence for coalescing random walks on @xmath178 with finite variance jumps and delayed coalescence ( describing the genealogy for a sample from kimura s stepping stone model on the discrete torus in which reproduction within each deme is modeled by a wright  fisher diffusion ) . in  @xcite , limic and sturm prove the analogous result when mergers between random walks within a deme are not necessarily pairwise . in the same spirit but on the continuous space @xmath1 and with additional",
    "_ large _ extinction / recolonization events ( similar to those described in section  [ subsmodel ] ) , the same asymptotic behavior is obtained in  @xcite for the systems of coalescing compound poisson processes describing the genealogy of a sample from the spatial @xmath0-fleming  viot process , under suitable conditions on the frequency and extent of the large events .    in all of these examples ,",
    "the result stems from a separation of timescales .",
    "for example , in  @xcite we were concerned with the genealogy of a sample picked uniformly at random from the whole torus . under this assumption , the time that two lineages need to be `` gathered '' close enough together that they can both be affected by the same event dominates the additional time the lineages take to coalesce , having being gathered . as explained in section  [ results ] , this decomposition does not hold when lineages start too close together , and so the tools developed for well - separated samples are of no use in the study of local correlations . however",
    ", although we still can not make precise statements about the genealogy of samples which are initially too close together , the work of sections  [ subseffectiverecomb ] and  [ subsdecorrelation ] , which are concerned with `` effective recombination '' and `` decorrelation , '' provides a much better understanding than we had before of the local mechanisms that create correlations between nearby lineages , how strong these correlations are , and how to `` escape '' them .",
    "our main results in this paper are concerned with samples taken at `` intermediate '' scales .",
    "individuals are sampled at pairwise distances much larger than the radius of the largest events , but these distances can still be much less than the radius of the torus . in this case ,",
    "the `` gathering time '' of two lineages starting at separation @xmath179 depends on that separation , but asymptotically this dependence is only through @xmath180 . as in the case of a uniform sample ,",
    "the gathering time dominates the additional time to coalescence . in theorem  3.3 of  @xcite",
    "we showed that if we sample a finite number of individuals uniformly at random from the geographic range of a population which is subject to small and large demographic events , then measuring time in units of size @xmath181 ( under the assumption on @xmath89 used here ) , their genealogical tree is determined by kingman s coalescent .",
    "in particular , if @xmath182 ( i.e. , large events are not too rare ) , one major effect of the presence of large extinction / recolonization events is to reduce the _ effective population size _ and , consequently , genetic diversity . the assumption of uniform sampling guarantees that initially ancestral lineages are @xmath183 apart .",
    "proposition  [ prop1locus ] extends the result by showing that , if we sample our individuals from much closer together , then we should consider two timescales .",
    "the first is @xmath184 $ ] .",
    "the second kicks in after @xmath185 , when the lineages start to feel the fact that space is limited and their ancestries evolve on the linear timescale @xmath186 .",
    "now , by the same reasoning , if there were no large events , these timescales would be , respectively , @xmath187 $ ] , and @xmath188 , @xmath109 .",
    "of course , one never observes genealogies directly and so , for illustration , we introduce ( infinitely many alleles ) mutation into our model and compute the probability that two individuals sampled at a given separation are _",
    "identical by descent _",
    "( ibd ) as a function of the exponent @xmath189 .",
    "in other words , what is the probability that the two individuals carry the same type ( at a given locus ) because it was inherited from a common ancestor .    since mutations are generally assumed to occur at a linear rate , while the first phase of the genealogical tree develops on a much slower exponential timescale , for a given time parameter @xmath107 $ ] , asymptotically as @xmath35 , we would see either zero or infinitely many mutations on the tree .",

    "we denote by @xmath191 the ratio @xmath192 .",

    "ibd decays approximately exponentially with the sampling distance , at least over small scales . in  @xcite , a numerical investigation of a similar model to that presented here revealed approximately exponential decay over small scales followed by a transition to a different exponential rate over somewhat larger scales .",
