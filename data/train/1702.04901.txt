    "discrete differential geometry studies discrete equivalents of the geometric notions and methods of classical differential geometry , such as notions of curvature and integrability for polyhedral surfaces . in this connection ,",
    "discrete surfaces have been studied one after another with strong ties to mathematics physics and great potential for computer analysis , architecture , numerics .",
    "progress in this field is to a large extent stimulated by its relevance for computer graphics and mathematical physics@xcite .",
    "recently , the expansion of computer graphics and applications in mathematical physics have given a great impulse to the issue of giving discrete equivalents of affine differential geometric objects@xcite . in @xcite a consistent definition of discrete affine spheres",
    "is proposed , both for definite and indefinite metrics , and in @xcite a similar construction is done in the context of improper affine spheres .",
    "following the ideas of klein , presented in his famous lecture at erlangen , several geometers in the early 20th century proposed the study of curves and surfaces with respect to different transformation groups . in geometry , an affine transformation , affine map or an affinity is a function between affine spaces which preserves points , straight lines and planes .",
    "also , sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation",
    ". an affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points , though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line .",
    "examples of affine transformations include translation , scaling , homothety , similarity transformation , reflection , rotation , shear mapping , and compositions of them in any combination and sequence .",
    "a centro - affine transformation is nothing but a general linear transformation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . in 1907",
    "tzitz@xmath4ica found that for a surface in euclidean 3-space the property that the ratio of the gauss curvature to the fourth power of the distance of the tangent plane from the origin is constant is invariant under a centro - affine transformation .",
    "the surfaces with this property turn out to be what are now called tzitz@xmath4ica surfaces , or proper affine spheres with center at the origin . in centro - affine differential geometry",
    ", the theory of hypersurfaces has a long history .",
    "the notion of centro - affine minimal hypersurfaces was introduced by wang @xcite as extremals for the area integral of the centro - affine metric .",
    "see also @xcite for the classification results about centro - affine translation surfaces and centro - affine ruled surfaces in @xmath5 .",
    "smooth geometric objects and their transformations should belong to the same geometry",
    ". in particular discretizations should be invariant with respect to the same transformation group as the smooth objects are(projective , affine , mbius etc ) .",
    "deterministic and statistical fractals are an important tool for the investigation of physical phenomena .",
    "they were used by mandelbrot to describe physical characteristics of things such as rivers , coastlines , bronchi and music .",
    "a vast literature on the theory and application of fractals has appeared .",
    "generalization of the sierpinski triangle to the sierpinski tetrahedron in three dimensions has been described in several places and generalizations to every dimension and every base for representing addresses have also been described .",
    "all of these generalizations are point based in that the finite approximations can essentially be described as points in @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "these representations are difficult to deal with visually in dimensions higher than three because of the large number of points and the difficulty in choosing a projection to preserve as much information and symmetry as possible@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a nature generalization for an affine sierpinski carpet to @xmath0-dimensional space , by using the generations and characterizations of affinely - equivalent sierpinski carpet , which is organized as follows : basic concepts of classical centro - affine geometry are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we define the discrete centro - affine hypersurface , and then obtain the structure equations , compatibility conditions and some centro - affine invariants . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the generations and characters of sierpinski carpet and menger sponge , and find their regularities .",
    "then we generalize the definition of menger sponge to @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "finally , we draw out the graphs of menger sponge in @xmath1-dimensional space . in section 5 , using the same method as in section 4 , we obtain the generalization of sierpinski triangle to @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are affine spaces , then every affine transformation @xmath8 is of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a linear transformation on @xmath6 and @xmath11 is a vector in @xmath7 . unlike a purely linear transformation ,",
    "an affine map need not preserve the zero point in a linear space .",
    "thus , every linear transformation is affine , but not every affine transformation is linear .    for many purposes an affine space can be thought of as euclidean space , though the concept of affine space is far more general ( i.e. , all euclidean spaces are affine , but there are affine spaces that are non - euclidean , for example , minkowski space ) . in affine coordinates , which include cartesian coordinates in euclidean spaces ,",
    "each output coordinate of an affine map is a linear function ( in the sense of calculus ) of all input coordinates .",
    "another way to deal with affine transformations systematically is to select a point as the origin ; then , any affine transformation is equivalent to a linear transformation ( of position vectors ) followed by a translation .",
    "it is well known that the set of all automorphisms of a vector space @xmath12 of dimension @xmath13 forms a group .",
    "we use the following standard notations for this group and its subgroups(@xcite ) : @xmath14 @xmath15 correspondingly , for an affine space @xmath16 , we have the following affine transformation groups .    &",
    "( m):=\\{:aa|l _  } .",
    "+ & ( m):=\\{|l_=1}. + & _ p(m):=\\{|(p)=p }  pa .",
    "+ & ( m):=\\{:aa|  b()v ,  = b ( ) , pa } + & a.    let @xmath17 be one of the groups above and @xmath18 subsets",
    ". then @xmath19 and @xmath20 are called equivalent modulo @xmath17 if there exists an @xmath21 such that @xmath22    in centro - affine geometry we fix a point in @xmath23(the origin @xmath24 without loss of generality ) and consider the geometric properties in variant under the centro - affine group @xmath25 .",
    "thus the mapping @xmath26 identifies @xmath23 with the vector space @xmath12 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "here , we introduce discrete analogues of centro - affine hypersurfaces though a purely geometric manner .",
    "these constitute particular ` discrete hypersurface ' which are maps @xmath29 in the following , we suppress the arguments of functions of @xmath30 , and denote increments of the discrete variables by subscripts , for example , @xmath31 moreover , decrements are indicated by overbars , that is , @xmath32 our convention for the range of indices is the following @xmath33 @xmath34 now we will give a definition for the discrete centro - affine hypersurface .",
    "especially , in the following , the point @xmath35 indicates the terminal point of the vector @xmath35 with its starting point at the origin @xmath36 .",
    "[ dcs - h](discrete centro - affine hypersurface ) a @xmath0-dimensional lattice ( net ) in @xmath37-dimensional affine space @xmath38 is called a discrete centro - affine hypersurface if the vector group @xmath39 are linearly independent , and the vector group @xmath40 are also linearly independent .    according to definition [ dcs - h ] , we know @xmath41 are linearly independent , so the following chain structures are obvious .",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 matrices @xmath44 are non - degenerate .",
    "the first column of matrix @xmath45 is @xmath46 and the element @xmath47 appears at position @xmath48 . especially , the @xmath49th column of matrix @xmath45 is the same as the @xmath50 column of matrix @xmath51 , that is @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the element of matrix @xmath51 in row @xmath23 and column @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , eqs .",
    "( [ tran-1-h])-([tran-3-h ] ) yields the compatibility conditions @xmath54 hence , we get the following structure equations and compatibility conditions from eqs .",
    "( [ tran-1-h])-([tran-3-h ] ) and ( [ com - con - h ] ) .",
    "the structure equations of the discrete centro - affine hypersurface can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the element of matrix @xmath51 in row @xmath23 and column @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "its compatibility conditions are @xmath59    indeed , from eqs .",
    "( [ tran-1-h])-([tran-3-h ] ) we obtain @xmath60}{[\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_1,\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_{a-1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n]},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 $ ] is the standard determinant in @xmath62 .",
    "hence , it is easy to conclude    the discrete functions @xmath56 are centro - affine invariant .    given the discrete functions @xmath56 , which satisfy the compatibility condition ( [ com - con - h ] ) , and then by using the initial @xmath37 points @xmath63,@xmath64 all point groups in the discrete centro - affine surface can be generated by using the chain rule ( [ tran-1-h])-([tran-3-h ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can state the following results .",
    "two discrete centro - affine surface are centro - affinely equivalent if and only if the invariants @xmath56 are same .",
    "[ self - sim ] a discrete centro - affine surface is self - similar if the centro - affine invariants @xmath56 are constant .    especially , if a hypersurface lies on a hyperplane which does not contain the origion @xmath36 , from eqs .",
    "( [ stru-1-h])-([stru-2-h ] ) , it is easy to see the coefficients of position vector @xmath63 should be zero . and then , we can obtain that all coefficients are invariant under the translation transformation .",
    "hence the following result are obvious .",
    "[ prop - hypplan]the hypersurface lies in a hyperplane which does not contain the origion @xmath36 if and only if @xmath65 in this case , the functions @xmath56 are affine invariant .",
    "furthermore , if the hypersurface lies in a hyperplane which does not contain the origion @xmath36 , since the functions @xmath56 are affine invariant , we can assume @xmath66 .",
    "then , we can calculate the invariants by @xmath67}{[\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}]},\\\\ ( ei)_{l+1,i+1}=\\frac{[\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_{ii}-\\mathbf{r}_i,\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}]}{[\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_l-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}]},\\\\ ( ei)_{l+1,j+1}=\\frac{[\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_{ij}-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}]}{[\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_l-\\mathbf{r},\\cdots,\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}]},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] especially , here @xmath61 $ ] is the standard determinant in @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath58 .",
    "using the local frame of discrete centro - affine surface in @xmath5 , we can study planar sierpinski carpet . since the sierpinski carpet lie in a plane , all coefficients in structure equations ( [ stru-1-h])-([stru-2-h ] ) are affine invariant .",
