    "the coupling constants can be fixed requiring a unique vacuum in the theory @xcite .",
    "one way to have a sensible theory is to ensure a single vacuum in any dimension . in that way , one obtains the einstein - hilbert action , with only the linear term in the curvature nonvanishing ( the coupling @xmath4 ) and the cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "when higher - order terms are present , it gives rise to chern - simons gravity @xcite in odd dimensions and born - infeld gravity @xcite in even dimensions ; but these vacua are @xmath6$]-fold degenerate , which does not allow a perturbative analysis around it .",
    "another way to have higher - order curvature terms and the unique vacuum in lovelock gravity which is not degenerate , is to keep only one euler term of order @xmath7 in riemann curvature and the cosmological constant ; then one obtains pure lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "this gravity possesses black hole solutions which asymptotically coincide with the corresponding einstein solution in spite of the more complicated field equations @xcite .",
