    "the standard theoretical framework for these decays is qcd factorization ( qcdf)@xcite which states that , to leading power accuracy in the heavy quark limit , the decay amplitude factorizes into perturbatively computable kernels and non - perturbative objects namely the @xmath15 transition form factors , the meson decay constants and the leading twist distribution amplitudes ( das ) of the mesons .",
    "traditionally the das for the vector meson are obtained from qcd sum rules ( sr)@xcite . the numerical values of the transition form factor and the tensor decay constant of the vector meson are obtained from light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) or lattice qcd .",
    "the predictive power of qcdf is limited by the uncertainties associated with these non - perturbative quantities and also by power corrections to the leading amplitude @xcite .",

    "we also predict the isospin asymmetry as well as the branching ratio for the decay @xmath18 within qcd factorization using ads / qcd holographic das for the @xmath1 meson .    finally , we use lcsr with ads / qcd das for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons to predict the form factors that govern the leading amplitudes of the rare radiative @xmath19 decays as well as the semileptonic decay @xmath20 .",
