    "elliptical galaxies are expected to have undergone violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , which is a collisionless process whereby the energies and angular momenta of stars and dark matter particles get redistributed by strong potential fluctuations in such a way that the outcome depends mainly on the macroscopic features of the initial conditions .",
    "this concept is supported by n - body experiments where for a range of initial conditions , the final state has more or less a universal profile .",
    "one of the insights gained from cold collapse simulations is that a compact region or a core develops , the system partially reexpands and then in a few crossing times settles into a centrally peaked configuration with most of the mass inside a radius within a fraction of the initial size ( van albada 1982 ) .",
    "the potential fluctuations are initially of large amplitude but they damp out in a few crossing times .",
    "clumpy and cold initial conditions with small values of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are total kinetic and potential energies , are preferred over hot or homogeneous conditions in order to produce final configurations that fit the de vaucoleurs @xmath10 surface density profile better .",
    "the general violent relaxation problem is difficult because the fluctuations have large amplitudes and damp in a few crossing times .",
    "thus there is no small parameter and just a single time scale .",
    "the physical process belongs to the broad category of interactions between _ waves _ ( potential fluctuations ) and _ particles _ ( stars or dark matter ) , wherein the amplitude of the wave is self - consistently determined by the positions of the particles .",
    "we start with the limiting case of small amplitudes , and long - lived waves , where we might expect the problem to submit to perturbative methods .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine even the linear modes of self - gravitating , collisionless systems ; this is because galaxies are spatially inhomogeneous objects .",
    "quasi - neutral plasmas are not subject to this problem , so let us examine the quasi - linear theory of landau damping of electrostatic waves in collisionless plasmas ( c.f .   49 of lifshitz & pitaevskii  1981 ) .",
    "the focus of the theory is on the slow evolution of the coarse - grained df ( distribution function ) of electrons , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is momentum .",
    "a key result is that @xmath11 obeys a diffusion equation in @xmath12space :    @xmath13    where the diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 , is nonzero only in a range of @xmath12 corresponding to electrons that are resonant with the perturbations .",
    "this diffusion causes smoothing , and creates a plateau in @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 is proportional to the energy in the fluctuations ; as this energy is absorbed by the resonant electrons , the diffusion itself weakens , and @xmath15 reaches a steady state .",
    "the point we wish to make here is that this evidently non - maxwellian steady state has been reached by a self - regulating diffusive process .",
    "there is of course a basic difference between slow damping of plasma waves , and the damping of the oscillations of a violently relaxing galaxy . in the former ,",
    "the energy in the waves is absorbed by resonant electrons , whereas the very concept of resonance is dubious in the latter case , because the oscillations are short - lived . in a relaxing galaxy , the orbits of particles are expected to be scattered by an oscillating core ( tremaine 1987 , spergel & hernquist 1992 ( sh ) ) . in realistic situations , the deflections are individually large but small in number .",
    "let us , nevertheless , for orientation , initially consider the limit in which each star , or dark matter particle , undergoes many small kicks .",
    "hence particles move under the combined actions of integrable forces , and small kicks that lead to global stochasticity . in stochastic regions of phase space",
    "far from islands , the diffusion of actions is well described by a fokker ",
    "planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "a feature of the fp equation for hamiltonian kicks is the complete absence of dynamical friction , a result as old as landau  1937 ( c. f.   5.4 of lichtenberg & lieberman  1983 ) .",
    "the fp equation resembles equation  ( [ diff ] ) , where @xmath12 are the actions .",
    "once again , @xmath14 is proportional to the square of the perturbation .",
    "the absence of friction implies that a maxwellian distribution is not the final steady state .",
    "in fact , the process being purely diffusive , it is evident that the df would approach one that is independent of the actions , given a finite volume of phase space and enough time .",
    "we learn from the above examples that in the limit of long - lived , small amplitude fluctuations , the relaxation of a galaxy is likely to be primarily diffusive in phase space .",
    "this relaxation process is very different from collisional relaxation in neutral gases , which is a reflection of the long - range nature of gravitational forces in contrast to the short range of interatomic forces .",
    "the distinction is made clearer by using the h - functions introduced by tremaine , henon , and lynden - bell  ( 1986 ) .",
    "they are actually functionals of the coarse - grained df , defined as    @xmath16=-\\int c(f)\\diff^3x\\,\\diff^3v\\,,\\label{hfunc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a convex function .",
    "any mixing process conserving fine grained phase density , such as collisionless relaxation , will increase @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this result needs the assumption that the initial state had the fine and coarse grained distribution equal to each other , which applies to the cold collapse simulations with which we are concerned with .",
    "it does not imply that @xmath19 increases monotonically ( dejonghe 1987 , sridhar 1987 ) . on the other hand , binary collisional processes , such as those relevant to thermal relaxation in neutral gases ,",
    "do not conserve phase density and single out a unique h - function , namely the boltzmann entropy given by @xmath20 .",
    "we now extrapolate to the case of the large amplitude , short  lived fluctuations appropriate to violent relaxation .",
    "when the `` actions '' change by large amounts , the mixing process is no longer correctly described by a diffusion equation .",
    "however , the relaxation is probably well described by a process of mixing without friction , and an initial df will spread as far as it can in phase space ; the extent and nature of the spreading being determined by dynamical constraints discussed in the following section .",
    "we write the df  @xmath21 factor expressing constraints , where @xmath22 is the single particle binding energy ( bound particles have positive @xmath22 ) . in the short duration before freeze - out , @xmath23 spreads out nearly evenly and beyond @xmath24 ( some particles escape ) .",
    "but in constructing distribution functions of the galaxy we do not include unbound particles .",
    "the parallel to diffusion without friction suggests a final state for which @xmath25 .    note that this hypothesis is the simplest choice consistent with the physics of violent relaxation .",
    "a similar concept was proposed by yankov ( 1994 ) to explain turbulent transport in plasmas of tokomaks with a uniform distribution of particles in a region specified by certain constraints of the problem .",
    "the relevant dynamical constraints will clearly depend on the context ; for instance , the merger of two galaxies is very likely to be different from the formation of dark halos by cosmological infall over extended periods of time .",
    "we now seek the dynamical constraints appropriate to situations such as the cold collapses familiar from numerical simulations ( c.f .",
    "van albada  1982 ) which might also carry over to the case of head - on mergers between galaxies . for simplicity , we assume that the relaxed system is spherical , and its df is a function of the energy , @xmath22 , and the angular momentum , @xmath27 . tremaine  ( 1987 ) has suggested the following two plausible physical requirements ( see also merritt , tremaine , & johnstone  1989 ( mtj ) , stiavelli & bertin  1987 ) .",
    "* r1 . * the potential fluctuations last for only a limited time , @xmath28 , which is of order a few crossing times .",
    "hence orbits with radial periods , @xmath1 , exceeding @xmath28 will be underpopulated by a factor @xmath29 . in terms of a plausible physical requirement , this is viewed as a uniform filling of those orbital phases which allowed the particle to visit the core in the time @xmath28 , and zero elsewhere . finally , of course",
    ", all phases are equally populated in the coarse grained function , which means a filling proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "* r2 . * the fluctuations",
    "are largely confined to a central region or a core of radius @xmath31 .",
    "hence only orbits whose pericenters are smaller than @xmath32 would have visited the region of large potential fluctuations , and have had a chance to relax violently .",
    "the validity of this will depend strongly on the initial conditions ; the collapse of a cold , nearly non - rotating initial configuration is more relevant to this study .    with this motivation ,",
    "we assume the following form for @xmath26    @xmath33    the first two factors in the distribution function are the dynamical constraints given by * r1 * and * r2 * respectively , and the third factor , @xmath23 , is taken to be a constant as discussed earlier .",
    "the first factor @xmath0 ensures the continuity of the df at @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "jaffe ( 1987 ) remarked that one asymptotic property of violently relaxed systems is that @xmath36 should be finite and non - zero at @xmath24 because the number of particles ejected from the core should be smooth across @xmath24 .",
    "we show in  [ states ] that for small @xmath22 , the restricted density of states due to the second factor in ( [ us ] ) is @xmath37 , while @xmath38 ( for finite mass systems ) and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "we define @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the first and second factors in ( [ us ] ) . in this work",
    ", we studied the following closely related models based on ( [ us ] ) .    * a model with @xmath43",
    "was first obtained and used as an input to generate the @xmath0 counterpart discussed below .",
    "details of this model are presented in appendix [ e1.5 ] .",
    "the dependence of the distribution function on @xmath22 and @xmath27 is explicit , and hence the analytic work can be carried further . * [ trpc ] @xmath44 , is presented in  [ 1/tr ] . here , the dependence of the radial period on @xmath22 and @xmath27 has to be derived iteratively from the potential . the models above form a good starting point for successive numerical iterations which we refer to as @xmath31 and @xmath45 models . a variant of these models with @xmath46 , with an extra parameter @xmath47 introduced to assess the sensitivity of the results to the functional form of the period cutoff .",
    "all the above models have the asymptotic properties @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( described above ) , and surface densities approximating the @xmath4 law . the form of energy distributions , @xmath36 , at distances larger than the core radius @xmath31 , or the scale radius @xmath50 , are derived for the pericenter model in  [ states ] . in  [ netr ] , we describe the form of @xmath36 for the @xmath1 models .",
    "this is helpful in picking out the pericenter cutoff models as a better fit to results of simulations . in  [ ftr ] we describe the boundaries in the @xmath51 plane required in doing the integrals in the allowed velocity space .",
    "the properties of the solutions and comparison to simulations are described in  [ prop ] , and we present a discussion in ",
    "[ disc ] , and conclusions in  [ conclude ] .",
    "the reader interested in first examining the results is urged to go to  [ prop][conclude ] and then return to  [ ftr][1/tr ] for some details of the construction .",
    "for a spherical model , with a distribution function , @xmath52 , including a sharp pericenter cutoff at @xmath31 or in angular momentum , @xmath45 , poisson s equation can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath23 is a constant that is determined by normalization .",

    "also it is clear from eqn ( [ jeta ] ) that the non - zero intercept of the constraint , @xmath220 , which is @xmath222 , has the desirable effect of implementing jaffe s ( 1987 ) insight that the differential energy distribution @xmath6 tends to a non - zero value as @xmath223 from below , since the probability of ejection from the core is not expected to be sensitive to small changes in the final energy .",

    "both the @xmath31 and @xmath45 models are very nearly isotropic within the core and rapidly become anisotropic .",
    "[ vr2 ] shows the radial velocity dispersions which indicate that the @xmath31 model is slightly more anisotropic than the @xmath45 model .",
    "the dispersion and anisotropy profiles are very similar to the fig 8 of van albada ( 1982 ) .",
    "in  [ quasi ] we made an assumption , based on a plausible picture of diffusion in action space , that @xmath228 ; as discussed in the previous section , the agreement with simulations is encouraging .",
    "however , the physical picture of mixing without friction leads to a constant @xmath23 only if the constraints are hard and the mixing lasts enough time , two things we can not lay down a priori .",
    "so the success of the simplest such model does teach us that this picture is a good first approximation , possibly improvable .",

    "mtj explored dfs with gaussian and lorentzian cutoffs in @xmath27 , multiplied by an exponential function of @xmath221 ; thus their models have one more parameter , a temperature , @xmath229 ( c.f . stiavelli & bertin 1987 ) .",

    "in contrast , sh assume that the kinetics drives the system to the maximum of their entropy functional",
    ". however , their boltzmann - like factor contains a _ negative _ temperature ( as in the mtj models ) , but this equilibrium is meaningful only in systems for which the density of accessible states decreases rapidly with energy ( c.f .   73 of landau & lifshitz  1980 ) .",
    "we suggest that the sh kinetic picture , with which we are in broad agreement , would not actually lead to a negative temperature distribution .",
    "the more appropriate physical picture is one of mixing in phase space .",
    "we have presented a semi - analytic model of violent relaxation that includes a new picture of diffusion in phase space with a novel implementation of the pericenter constraint , and the @xmath0 incompleteness factor .",
    "notions of even a partial thermal equilibrium with boltzmann - like exponential factors play no role  a property we regard as a virtue in describing a collisionless system .",
    "the rise in the energy distribution function which such factors ( with negative temperatures ! ) mimicked in earlier work now arises naturally from the pericenter cutoff in our calculation .",

    "the fact that the properties of the models are parameter free ( @xmath204 and @xmath205 are merely used to normalize ) , may be a considered a virtue , as they demonstrate that the constraints explored here seem to capture the essential details in the case of cold non - rotating collapse .",
    "more realistic systems can be obtained if one deviated from the simplifying assumptions and comprehensively explored associated models such as @xmath232 in  [ 1/tr ] , albeit with more parameters . even though sophisticated numerical codes that now exist to perform n - body experiments , semianalytic models help in understanding their output .",
    "they also have the advantage of fitting simulations and observed galaxies reasonably well .",
    "possible directions of future work include a more detailed comparison of our models with numerical simulations , investigations of stability and extension to axisymmetric systems .",
    "we have carried out a detailed study of models with @xmath41 , the first factor in eqn ( [ us ] ) , chosen to be @xmath182 , with both kinds of cutoff , viz .",
    "pericenter and angular momentum .",
    "exisiting work , by mtj , uses a gaussian rather than sharp cutoff in angular momentum .",
    "the pericenter cutoff has not been implemented previously and  [ ftr ] gives some details to enable the interested reader to see how the sharply cutoff models are constructed , and other details of its properties along with comparisons to simulations can be found elsewhere ( mangalam & sellwood 1999 ) . as a first approximation and the simplest model",

    "is dominated more by orbits with largely radial velocities and the first of the 2 terms limits the orbits to those which have angular momenta less than the bound specified by @xmath243 . in the limit of @xmath244 , the rhs of ( [ dense ] ) for @xmath92 vanishes as expected .",
    "we now scale the radius by @xmath245 , and the potential by @xmath246 , similar to scalings employed for the polytrope problem ( with the difference that we have the normalization constant @xmath175 ) and obtain the following relations @xmath247 @xmath248 where @xmath249 is a geometric factor that depends on the solution . here",
