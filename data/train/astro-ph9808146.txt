    "a source of this type would produce an x - ray flux @xmath82 , much lower than the detection threshold of rosat .",

    "theoretical and observational work in the past decade has advanced a picture where gas heated up by the central energy source is able to penetrate the ambient -layer and then to escape into the galactic halo with velocities of the order of @xmath83 kms@xmath11 ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , heckman et al .",
    "1987 , norman & ikeuchi 1989 and references therein ) where it produces an extended shock region .",
    "this mechanism could cause component e. the presence of wind of warm gas with a velocity @xmath84 kms@xmath11 with its axis pointing to the ne of the nuclear region is already suggested by optical spectroscopy ( taniguchi et al .",

    "( 1994 , hereafter sbhl94 ) have shown that in a nuclear starburst - wind the bulk of the soft ( 0.22.2 kev ) x - ray photons will not be produced in the wind material itself but rather by its collisionally shocked interface with the ambient halo gas . by analogy to the model prediction of sbhl94 , component e could be interpreted as the shell of a hot cavity expanding from the nuclear starburst , with the wind material itself being too hot ( @xmath85 k ) to make a measurable flux contribution to the rosat energy band .",
    "read & ponman ( 1998 ) have presented a thorough discussion on unipolar outflows of hot gas seeming not to be unusual among colliding galaxies in a mid - stage of merging .",
    "an unipolar structure seems to readily evolve when injection occurs above the galaxy plane ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) or in the presence of a kinematically disturbed ism .",
    "models a1 and a2 of sbhl94 are computed assuming starburst properties similar to those we have adopted for ngc  7714 , e.g. a sfr of 2 yr@xmath11 , salpeter imf and @xmath86  myr and yield a number of predictions in accord with the present observations .",
    "for instance the luminosity of component e can be accommodated by a wind - halo interaction model when assuming a halo density @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "however , in this model it is expected that the source will appear much more extended than the rather compact component e.    alternatively , component e may be the result of the collision of a starburst - driven wind with the western boundary of the -bridge discovered by smith et al .",
    "this would lead to the formation of a shocked interface at the radius where the ram pressure ( @xmath89 ) of the wind becomes equal to the ambient pressure of the -gas . as discussed in tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun ( 1997 ) , while the outer shock is going on sweeping up the ambient cold gas , the inner ( reverse ) shock will thermalize the wind to temperatures of @xmath90 k where @xmath91 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath92 . in this model , the adopted plasma temperature @xmath72 k corresponds to a post - shock temperature generated by a velocity of the order of @xmath93 kms@xmath11 .",
    "pressumably , such a process is going to produce a relatively compact shocked interface with size comparable to the diameter of the western tip of the -bridge , yielding a better correspondence to the morphology of component e than the wind - halo interaction hypothesis .    in summary",
    ", the morphological and energetic properties of component e may be understood in terms of the collision of a starburst - driven wind with the eastern -bridge rather than collision with the tenuous halo - gas .      a further hypothesis for the origin of the x - ray emission in region e invokes gas infall from the eastern -bridge on the -disk of ngc  7714 .",
    "as shown by tenorio - tagle ( 1982 ) the energy - release caused by an -cloud impinging on the disk can provoke a supersonic expansion of a hot ( @xmath9@xmath94 k ) ring - shaped cavity in the ambient cold medium .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were not able to confirm a systematic motion of the massive ( @xmath95 ) -bridge towards ngc  7714 .",
    "nevertheless , they measured a projected velocity dispersion @xmath96 kms@xmath11 within the -bridge .",
    "therefore , if the -bridge is intersecting the disk of ngc  7714 high - speed gas cloud collisions are likely to occur in the interaction zone .    if the infalling gas medium is composed of clouds with a radius @xmath97 pc and a volume filling factor @xmath98 then the mean free path @xmath99 of an interloping cloud amounts to @xmath100 pc , thus less than the disk thickness of ngc  7714 .",
    "given the low sound speed in such a cloud ( @xmath101 ; spitzer 1978 ) , a collision at a relative velocity @xmath102 few 100  would be characterized by a high mach number , thus , give rise to a strong shock wave propagating within either cloud with a velocity @xmath103 ( jog & solomon 1992 ) . from the latter considerations ,",
    "a strip of shocked material with size comparable to @xmath104 ( @xmath105 kpc ) can be formed in a time span of few myr when @xmath106 . substituting the estimated intrinsic x - ray luminosity of component e and such a radius in eq.(1 ) we obtain for the mass of the hot interior @xmath107 . from eq.(3 ) of nulsen et al .",
    "( 1984 ) the corresponding gas cooling time is @xmath108 myr .",
    "an estimate of @xmath109 erg for the energy content of component e can be inferred assuming a constant radiation of @xmath110   over @xmath111 .",
    "this is equivalent to the kinetic energy of a cloud with mass @xmath112  ( @xmath113% of the mass of the -bridge ) plunging onto the disk of ngc  7714 with a velocity @xmath114 . + from the virial mass of @xmath115  within a radius of 15  inferred for ngc  7714 by bernlhr ( 1993 ) and assuming rotational motions one obtains at the distance of component e a circular velocity of @xmath84 kms@xmath11 .",
    "thus , the required collisional velocity @xmath114 is already comparable to the average circular gas velocity in the disk of ngc  7714 .",
    "+ as a result , the release of kinetic energy at region e can be understood in a twofold manner : gas infall onto the disk by analogy to galactic _ worms _ ( heiles 1979 , mirabel 1982 ) and/or collision of rotationally moving -clouds of the disk of ngc  7714 with the western boundary of the -bridge .",
    "clearly , a number of parameters must be specified to assess the energy output of these processes .",
    "most important , the -kinematics and the thermalization efficiency during such a collision remains uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that in view of the energetics such a mechanism powered by cloud collisions only can readily account for the observed x - ray luminosity in component  e.      reinfall of tidally ejected matter is likely to be a frequent occurrence in the merging of two gas - rich galaxies ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) and may well be accompanied by processes discussed in sects.4.2.1&4.2.2 generating x - ray emission . however , it is difficult to analyze how such processes depend on the kinematical , dynamical and geometrical circumstances of the merging event . while read & ponman ( 1998 ) do not report the presence of any strong extranuclear features they find the clear presence of low - surface - brightness extended x - ray emission in their sample .",
    "they discuss the possibility that such x - ray halos seen in evolved mergers do not form entirely through the starburst - driven ejection of hot gas from the nucleus , but also through infalling shock - heated tidal matter .",
    "if component e is due to a systematic gas infall from the bridge one may speculate about the observability of this feature . among the fifteen thoroughly investigated colliding systems shown in fig.5 only arp  284 exhibits a high - surface - brightness extranuclear x - ray component .",
    "assuming that the formation of such features in the interaction region must commonly occur at some stage during the collision lasting @xmath116 yr , then from a statistical point of view this feature can not survive much longer than @xmath117 yr .",
    "this time - scale does not seem unreasonable : as discussed above , the initial impact between two cold media with a velocity of a few @xmath118 100  can readily give rise to the formation of a shocked interface .",
    "subsequent infall of cold gas occurring with a velocity smaller than the internal sound speed in the hot cavity is not expected to add much to the shock - induced luminosity .",
    "the period of visibility of such a shock - region ( identified with region e of arp  284 ) will be of the order of its cooling time @xmath119 yr . while mass - loading of the hot cavity enhances the cooling efficiency , differential rotation may smear the high - surface - brightness x - ray features ( again on a time - scale @xmath85 yr ) , thus contributing to the formation of a diffuse low - surface - brightness x - ray halo similar to those found by fricke & papaderos ( 1996 ) and read & ponman ( 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that arp  284 is the result of an off - center encounter between the spiral galaxies ngc  7714/15 ( smith et al .",

    "alternatively , gas  infall from the eastern -bridge onto the disk of ngc  7714 with a speed comparable to the intrinsic disk velocity dispersion can produce a collisional interface powering component e. collisional breaking of the disk - rotation in ngc  7714 by -clouds contributes an additional energy source .",
    "we argue that the x - ray spot is a transient phenomenon and may eventually evolve into an extended low - surface - brightness x - ray halo as commonly observed in merging systems .",

    "<S> we discuss the x - ray properties of the interacting system arp  284 , consisting of the active nuclear starburst galaxy ngc  7714 and its post - starburst companion ngc  7715 . </S>",
    "<S> a morphological signature of the interaction , thought to have started @xmath0 myr ago , is an asymmetric stellar ring dominating the intensity profile of ngc  7714 in the inner disk ( @xmath1 exponential scale lengths ) . in agreement to previous _ </S>",
    "<S> einstein_-data our rosat  pspc exposure shows the x - ray emission of arp284 to be confined to ngc  7714 . the bulk of the intrinsic x - ray luminosity in the rosat 0.12.4 kev band can be accounted for by thermal emission from hot ( @xmath2 k ) gas and amounts to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up observations with the rosat  hri revealed two distinct extended emitting regions contributing to the x - ray luminosity in ngc  7714 . </S>",
    "<S> the more luminous of them ( @xmath4 ) coincides with the central starburst nucleus and can be explained this way . </S>",
    "<S> the fainter one ( @xmath5 ) is located @xmath6  off - center and does not have any conspicuous optical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> it is , likely , located at the borderline between the stellar ring and a massive ( @xmath7 ) -bridge further to the east possibly intersecting ngc  7714 . </S>",
    "<S> the  and x - ray morphology and the extensive starburst nature of the nuclear energy source suggest different scenarios for the formation of the eastern emission spot . the possibilities of ( i ) collisional heating of the outlying gas by a starburst - driven nuclear wind and ( ii ) infall of -clouds from the bridge onto the disk of ngc  7714 are discussed . </S>"
