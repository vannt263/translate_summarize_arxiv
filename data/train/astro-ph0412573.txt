    "1998 , 2000 , 2001 ; frayer et al .  1998 , 1999 , 2004 ) , as follow - up of blank field sources without the lensing boost required significantly more resources ( e.g. , gear et al .",

    "it had been hoped that long - wavelength observations of the dust emission spectrum of these galaxies might be prove a reliable route to derive their redshifts and luminosities .",
    "the submm / radio flux ratio was first used by carilli & yun ( 1999 ) in this manner to estimate the typical redshift of smgs , however the technique was recognized immediately to have limited accuracy ( @xmath18% redshift errors ) if there was a range of dust temperatures ( @xmath5 ) present .",
    "this uncertainty is particularly important when deriving luminosities and related properties from submm observations as the submm flux density is @xmath19 for a fixed fir luminosity at @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath5  and @xmath21 ( blain 1999 ) , which limits the usefulness of simple photometric redshifts for estimating luminosities for the smg population .",

    "however , the resulting sample is still restricted in size and unrepresentative of the general properties of the smg population ( with a bias towards optically - bright counterparts and a preponderance of strong - lined agn ) .",
    "a redshift survey of a large and representative sample of submm galaxies is therefore urgently required .",
    "chapman et al .  ( 2003b  hereafter c03 ) demonstrated that spectroscopic redshifts can be obtained for even the optically faintest smgs , spanning a factor of @xmath22 in @xmath23-band flux , allowing a much more representative sample of the population to be studied .",

    "our redshift for smmj105158.02 + 571800.3 ( @xmath57 ) is derived from two uv - absorption features and the detection of h@xmath54  ( swinbank et al.2004 ) , and we regard our redshift as a more robust identification .",
    "our redshift for smmj141809.00 + 522803.8 is derived primarily from strong ly@xmath54 in emission , but lies at a redshift ( @xmath58 ) that makes it difficult to followup in nebular lines using near - ir spectrographs , casting some doubt on the reality of the simpson et al .",
    "redshift ( simpson et al .",
    "2004 in fact suggest that their redshift is likely to be spurious based on the weakness of the features and the residuals present from sky - line subtraction ) .",
    "the primary criteria for considering a redshift as robust is the identification of multiple emission / absorption lines .",
    "our redshift identifications are confirmed by the detection of other lines and continuum features in 75% ( 55 ) of the identified spectra : agn lines ( civ@xmath591549 , siv@xmath591397 , nv@xmath591240 ) , as well as weaker stellar and interstellar features , and continuum breaks .",
    "we also consider redshifts to be robust if we detected a large equivalent width line ( @xmath60 ) , and there is supporting evidence that this line is ly@xmath54 .",
    "only one quarter ( 18 ) of the 73 spectroscopic redshifts are single - line identifications .",

    "the observed wavelength lies below 4000(sometimes below 3700 ) , precluding a reasonable identification as [ oii]@xmath593727 at @xmath61 given the optical faintness and submm / radio detection .",
    "we also have two independent tests of the reliability of our redshifts .",
    "firstly , we have obtained keck / nirspec and vlt / isaac near - ir spectroscopic observations for a significant fraction of our sample to probe the nebular line emission to measure the star formation rates , estimate metallicities and study kinematics .",
    "these observations have successfully detected restframe h@xmath54 ( and frequently [ nii ] ) emission in 26 cases ( swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ) , confirming the uv - based redshifts in the present paper .",
    "ten of the 18 single - line identifications have been confirmed in h@xmath54 .",
    "the near - ir h@xmath54  spectra were also able to break degeneracies in 5 cases where spectral identifications based only on uv - absorption lines were consistent with two similar redshifts .",
    "these h@xmath54/[nii ] results were also used to aid in the spectroscopic classification of our sample , as indicated in table  3 .",
    "secondly , 15 of our smg redshifts have been confirmed with co line emission using the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( neri et al.2003 ; greve et al .",
    "2005 ) , including 2 single - line identifications .",
    "these detections not only confirm the precision of the uv - based redshifts for the counterparts we targeted , but equally importantly they also confirm that these galaxies are gas - rich systems suitable to be the source of the luminous far - infrared emission detected in the submm waveband .",
    "the strength of the ly@xmath54 lines for the smgs vary tremendously in both line flux ( l@xmath62 from 160@xmath8jy ) and restframe equivalent width , which ranges from @xmath633  ( absorption ) to @xmath64  ( we note that we see no obvious variation in the radio / submm properties of smgs as a function of ly@xmath54 line strength ) . with the generally faint rest - frame uv continua exhibited by our smg ( 65% are fainter than @xmath65 ) , there is a bias in our sample against obtaining redshifts for the weaker emission line sources at the faintest continuum fluxes .",

    "[ figsel ] , where the increased failure rate for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts is apparent for @xmath66 .",
    "this bias is highlighted by the fact that sources with identifiable ly@xmath54 absorption only appear in our sample for smgs with @xmath67 .",
    "we discuss the spectral properties and incompleteness of our sample in more detail in  3.4 .",
    "to understand the characteristics of the submm population we first have to quantify how the selection criteria for our sample ( e.g. , radio , submm and optical flux limits , spectroscopic incompleteness ) may have influenced the observed properties .",

    "this suggests that the long - wavelength properties of our spectroscopic sample are likely to be representative of the more general submm population .",
    "a crucial feature of the present study is that by analyzing only the radio - identified smg we are considering only part of the total smg population .",
    "we must therefore determine the influence of the resulting selection function before drawing wider conclusions about flux - limited submm samples .",
    "about 65% of the bright ( @xmath75mjy ) smg population are detectable in the deepest radio maps obtainable with the vla ( ivison et al .",

    "by contrast , the selection bias vanishes at higher redshifts ; increasingly hotter sources become detectable with scuba above our radio limit ( @xmath78@xmath8jy in the typical field ) .",
    "however , our requirement of a radio detection to pinpoint the spectroscopic counterpart of the submm source means that the opposite selection bias comes into play in our sample ( fig .",

    "in addition they found that the radio highlights regions of low uv emission as bolometrically - luminous in @xmath4650% of the smgs .",
    "an increasing proportion of very - highly obscured activity may therefore be present in the more active systems .",
    "this has also been demonstrated through measurements of the nebular h@xmath54 emission line for our smg sample ( swinbank et al.2004 ) . in this way",
    "the selection of flux - limited samples of galaxies in the restframe uv and fir would give significantly different mean obscurations .",
    "this is equivalent to stating that the uv luminosities and spectral slopes are measurable for only the least - obscured regions of the galaxies and hence are not representative of the bulk of the emission in these galaxies .",
    "it is not therefore surprising that they indicate much lower bolometric emission .",
    "we therefore conclude that although many smgs can be detected , and their redshifts estimated or measured in deep observations in the restframe uv , they can not generally be identified as bolometrically luminous galaxies without the use of radio or submm observations .",
    "there is a second , related important point to make before we proceed to discuss the evolutionary history of the luminosity density contributed by smgs versus uv - selected galaxies over the lifetime of the universe . in the light of the vast mismatch in the derived bolometric emission for this population",
    "we will assume that the contribution of bright smgs to the star formation density at high redshifts is not included in current uv estimates ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 )  and so we need to derive the contribution from the highly obscured population independently and sum this with that from the uv to derive the total .      using the bolometric luminosities measured above for the smgs ,",
    "we calculate the following bolometric luminosity densities in redshift bins from our survey : @xmath227 = @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 for redshift intervals of @xmath121.5 , 1.82.6 and 2.63.5 respectively .",
    "these luminosity densities are calculated for the entire radio - identified smg population , and corrected for spectroscopic completeness in the following way . for the 26% of radio - smgs for which we did not obtain redshifts , we corrected the clear deficit of sources in the redshift range @xmath1931.8 to result in a smooth distribution matching our normalized model ( fig .",
    "the remainder of the incompleteness ( 17% ) was distributed uniformly over the entire @xmath231 uncovered by our robust redshift sample .",

    "2004 ) : see  3.4 .    in order to justify translating these luminosity densities into star formation rate densities ( sfrds )",
    "we must first clearly identify the signs of agn activity in the individual galaxies , and then remove any contribution to the luminosities of these galaxies from the agn , either direct contribution to the radio emission or through heating of dust by the agn .",
    "we begin by assessing the possible agn contribution in individual submm galaxies from their uv spectral properties .",
    "three smgs are identified with qsos in our radio - identified sample ( smmj123716.01 + 620323.3 , smmj131215.27 + 423900.9 , and smmj131222.35 + 423814.1 ) : these are the only objects in which the optical luminosity is a non - negligible fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "these sources have comparable optical and fir luminosities and space densities to submm - detected qsos at @xmath85 ( omont et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; carilli et al .",
    ". the fraction of optically bright qsos in the smg population could actually be slightly higher since @xmath4620% of our smgs were pre - selected with optically faint magnitudes .",
    "this implies that only @xmath232% ( 3/80 , as a fraction of the total radio - smg sample observed spectroscopically , which were nt pre - selected as optically faint ) of optically - bright agn have @xmath163  emission with comparable luminosity to that seen in the optical waveband ( since our survey would have uncovered all the qsos emitting strongly in the radio / submm ) .",
    "this fraction of radio - smgs are therefore removed from consideration in determining the luminosity density evolution .",
    "there are several strong indications that star formation dominates the luminosity of the majority of the 98 radio - smgs in our sample . as discussed in  3.3 , 30% of our sample with the brightest uv continua exhibit stellar and interstellar absorption lines , implying that their continua are dominated by young , massive stars and not the non - thermal power law spectrum of an agn .",
    "another 25% of our sample have uv continua which are too faint to detect absorption features , but remain consistent with starbursts , while a further 25% do not reveal enough features to even identify a redshift .",
    "these statistics suggest that @xmath23380% of radio - smgs do not harbor an partially- or un - obscured , luminous agn .",
    "the presence of an obscured agn is much more difficult to determine from the restframe uv spectra and instead we have to turn to multiwavelength surveys of samples of smgs .",
    "high spatial resolution radio observations of smgs are one route for determining the morphology of their radio ( and by implication fir ) emission and hence search for the presence of a strong agn contribution to the fir ( identified as a radio point - source ) .",
    "such studies reveal extended morphologies on scales @xmath2341  in 65% of cases ( 8/12 galaxies in chapman et al.2004b ) .",

    "several of the galaxies with spatially - extended radio emission show agn emission lines in their rest - frame uv spectra , underlining the fact that intense starbursts are likely to be energetically - important , even in the presence of agn .",

    "this suggests that the properties of the bright submm population is more closely linked with the formation and evolution of the galaxies or galactic halos which host qsos , than the more typical , modestly star - forming galaxies identified from their restframe uv emission .",
    "nevertheless , there is likely to be an intermediate luminosity regime where the uv- and submm - selected populations overlap significantly , and therefore where their evolution becomes similar  we propose that this likely occurs at sub - mjy levels .      using our the long - wavelength seds which we fitted to the submm / radio observations of the smgs we can calculate their contribution to the extragalactic background at other wavelengths in the far - infrared .",

    "we see that the smg sample we are studying contributes around 20% of the background at @xmath255 m and a diminishing fraction at shorter wavelengths .    to provide a simple baseline comparison we also illustrate the contributions to the firb if all of the smg s lie at @xmath108 ( the median redshift of our model - corrected spectroscopic sample ) and have seds matching that of arp220 , again normalized to our total 850@xmath0mflux .",
    "note that the actual peak of the background due to the smgs is significantly broadened by the dispersion in their redshifts and dust temperature , compared to a single @xmath5@xmath4645k - like arp220 sed at @xmath108 .",
    "the contribution of smgs to the peak of the firb varies on a galaxy by galaxy basis by a factor of @xmath256 .",

    "martini & weinberg ( 2001 ) suggest that qsos endure for @xmath4640myr , requiring that smgs are active for @xmath46200400myr , not too discrepant from our adopted smg timescale of 100myr estimated above .",
    "another possibility is that the qso may often represent a phase in the active lifetime of a subset of smgs , dependent on environmental conditions that facilitate the funneling of material from the extended smg starburst to the growing central engine .",
    "it is worth seriously considering the possibility of an inter - relation between the smg and qso phenomena .",
    "the local _ magorrian _ relation ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) between black hole mass and stellar bulge mass suggests that super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) must be growing at a rate roughly proportional to the stars . the smgs appear to be prodigiously forming stars , with the modest x - ray luminosities of smgs suggesting either low rates of accretion onto super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) and/or moderate smbh masses ( alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) . both of these possibilities suggest that substantial smbh growth is needed to evolve onto a magorrian relation .",
    "a logical conclusion is that the smgs are indeed an early phase in the evolution of a massive galaxy , forming many stars quickly over @xmath4610kpc spatial scales , as shown by the extended radio emission tracing uv structures ( chapman et al.2004b ) .",
    "as the merger proceeds , the growing smbh will begin to accrete material more quickly as instabilities drive material to more concentrated configurations .",
    "the smbh thus grows ever more rapidly , on a timescale which is delayed from that of the initial starburst ( see also archibald et al .",
    "2002 ) , eventually blowing channels through the dust and becoming visible as a qso . indeed , page et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and stevens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have measured significant submm emission from x - ray self - absorbed qsos , suggesting that an intermediate stage between smgs and qsos is being directly observed .",
    "this is also consistent with the 3/80 qso detection rate ( 4% ) for our unbiased smg sample , if it is assumed that all submm - detected qsos are x - ray absorbed ( stevens et al .",
    "2004 ) . under this scenario ,",
    "the proportion of x - ray absorbed qsos is 1/6 of the entire qso population ( stevens et al .",
    "2004 ) and hence the ratio of qso - to - smg lifetimes should be 18/80 , or @xmath460.23 , consistent with the volume densities described above .",
    "most likely , the relationship between smgs and other galaxy populations spans a range of scenarios and evolutionary histories , and more comprehensive models will be required to understand and further test the evolution of smgs .",
    "we have assembled a detailed account of the properties of the radio - identified smgs .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for 73 radio - smgs from deep optical spectroscopy of 98 targets attempted , for a success rate of 74% .",
    "the redshift distribution of smgs is now well constrained  showing a pronounced peak at @xmath274 for our radio - selected sample and a predicted median of @xmath275 for a purely submm - flux - limited sample , similar in form to distribution seen for radio- , optical- and x - ray - selected qsos .",
    "we also demonstrate that the simple radio / submm redshift estimator , which has been used extensively in the literature to attempt constraint the redshift distribution of smgs , is not reliable for individual smg redshifts ( @xmath276 ) . for the smgs which are detectable with good signal - to - noise ( @xmath277 ) in deep ground - based images , photometric redshifts in the @xmath278 bands",
    "appear to provide a more accurate constraint on the true redshifts of individual smgs .",
    "we find that the radio - smgs for which we failed to obtain robust spectroscopic redshifts have similar @xmath139/@xmath140 colors to those with robust redshifts , and conclude that the entire radio - smg population is likely to have a similar distribution to the spectroscopic redshift distribution presented here .",
    "we have also discuss the likely redshifts of smgs without radio identifications to fill in more details of the entire smg population brighter than 5mjy at 850@xmath8 m .",
    "we measure dust temperatures and bolometric luminosities for smgs by exploiting our precisely - known redshifts and assuming the local fir ",
    "radio correlation .",
    "the sed variation in our smgs likely arises from a dispersion in dust temperature , but could also arise from a broader scatter in the fir ",
    "radio correlation than observed locally .",
    "if the sed variation were caused entirely by variations in the fir ",
    "radio correlation then the fir  radio scatter would have to increase from the 0.2dex observed locally to @xmath279dex .",
    "we view this as unlikely and so attribute most of the range in sed properties for the smgs as down to differences in characteristic dust temperature .",
    "we construct a bolometric luminosity function and compare to local _",
    "iras _ galaxies as well as estimates for uv - selected galaxies at @xmath73 .",
    "we predict the expected fir luminosities of the smg population based on their uv luminosities and continuum slope , using the standard prescription for this conversion for uv - selected populations .",
    "we find that the true bolometric luminosity of an smg is typically underestimated by @xmath280 when extrapolated from their restframe uv properties .",
    "we therefore conclude that observations at radio / submm wavelengths are essential to distinguish which @xmath2483 galaxies have the huge luminosities characteristic of smgs .",
    "we assess the sfrd evolution of smgs , both from our observed @xmath465mjy smg sample and from a modest extrapolation of our sample properties down to 1mjy .",
    "our results highlight the very different evolution of smgs over uv - selected galaxies ( and noting the close similarity in evolution between smgs and qsos ) .",
    "this suggests that the properties of the bright submm population is more closely linked with the formation and evolution of the galaxies or galactic halos which host qsos , than the more typical , modestly star - forming galaxies identified from their restframe uv emission .",
    "we emphasize that uv - measurements of the smgs do not typically reveal the enormous bolometric luminosities present , and the smgs and dust - corrected uv - selected galaxies in the sfrd diagram should be summed together to obtain a complete census of the sfrd evolution in the universe .",
    "the smg sample we are studying contributes around 20% of the background at @xmath255 m and a diminishing fraction at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the contribution of smgs to the firb at @xmath281@xmath0mcan be predicted by fitting dusty sed templates to the radio and submm fluxes at the measured redshifts .",
    "this prediction is considerably less than expected from assuming an arp  220-like sed , since the smgs have cooler characteristic dust temperatures than arp  220 .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ is likely to provide important diagnostics of the highly obscured central regions of the smgs through mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "we are rapidly approaching the point of being able to put all the evidence about properties of smgs together .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts allow us to study aspects of the smg population which can not be addressed using photometric redshift estimators .",
    "astrophysical properties of the smgs are diagnosed through the restframe uv and optical spectra themselves , probing for example the excitation conditions , metallicities , and wind outflows ( swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ; i.  smail , in preparation ) .",
    "the clustering of the smgs is clearly a pressing question , and surprisingly , even with our small sample we are already in a strong position to characterize the clustering through the redshift distribution , finding a correlation length r@xmath282mpc ( blain et al .",
    "the impact of smgs on their environments and the inter - galactic medium can be studied directly using background qsos in the same fields ( s.  chapman , in preparation ) . with precise redshifts , x - ray spectral analysis in deep _",
    "exposures is possible through the stacking of sub - groups of smgs with similar x - ray absorption properties , yielding significant fek@xmath54 emission line detections and characterization of the x - ray spectral shape ( d.  alexander , in preparation ) .",
    "we conclude that with the availability of precise redshifts for large samples of fir luminous galaxies , these populations can now be used to trace the evolution of the most luminous galaxies in the universe .",
    "a focus of our future work will be to identify the influence of this population on their environments .",

    "<S> however , the _ dust - corrected _ ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosities of the galaxies rarely hint at their huge bolometric luminosities indicated by their radio / submm emission , underestimating the true luminosity by a median factor of @xmath4 for smgs with pure starburst spectra . </S>",
    "<S> radio and submm observations are thus essential to select the most luminous , high - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the 850@xmath0 m , radio , and redshift data is used to estimate the dust temperatures , and characterize photometric redshifts . using 450@xmath0 m  measurements for a subset of our sample we confirm that the median dust temperature of @xmath5=36@xmath67k , derived assuming the local fir  </S>",

    "<S> we calculate total infrared and bolometric luminosities ( the median infrared luminosity estimated from the radio is @xmath10l@xmath11 ) , construct a luminosity function , and quantify the strong evolution of the submm population across @xmath123.5 , relative to local _ iras _ galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we use the bolometric luminosities and uv - spectral classifications to determine a lower limit to the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) content of the population , and measure directly the varying contribution of highly - obscured , luminous galaxies to the luminosity density history of the universe for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that bright submm galaxies contribute a comparable star formation density to lyman - break galaxies at @xmath13 and including galaxies below our submm flux limit this population may be the dominant site of massive star formation at this epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid evolution of submm galaxies and qso populations contrasts with that seen in bolometrically lower luminosity galaxy samples selected in the restframe uv , and suggests a close link between submm galaxies and the formation and evolution of the galactic halos which host qsos . </S>"
