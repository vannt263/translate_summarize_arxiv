    "the hydrostatic reconstruction is based on a general principle of reconstruction .",
    "we begin with a first order finite volume scheme for the form of sw@xmath32d ( without source terms ) : choosing a positive and consistent numerical flux @xmath37 ( _ e.g. _ rusanov , hll , kinetic , ... ) , a finite volume scheme writes under the general form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the time step and @xmath40 the space step . the idea is to modify this scheme by applying the flux to reconstructed variables .",
    "reconstruction can be used to get higher order schemes ( muscl , eno , ... ) , in that case higher order in time is obtained through tvd - runge - kutta methods . and the aim of the hydrostatic reconstruction is to be well - balanced .",

    "we describe now the implementation of this method for high order accuracy .",
    "the first step consists in performing a high order reconstruction ( muscl , eno , ... ) . to treat properly the topography source term @xmath42 ,",
    "this reconstruction is applied on @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this gives us the reconstructed variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , on which the hydrostatic reconstruction is applied @xmath48 the finite volume scheme is modified as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 are left ( resp .",

    "the flux is now applied with reconstructed variables @xmath51 and we take @xmath52 finally , for consistency and well - balancing , a centered source term is added @xmath53 the chosen numerical strategy consists in the hll flux ( see @xcite , not detailed here ) and a modified muscl reconstruction .",
    "it has shown to be the best compromise between accuracy , stability and cpu time cost ( in @xcite ) .",
    "the muscl reconstruction of a scalar variable @xmath54 writes @xmath55 with the minmod slope limiter @xmath56 with @xmath57 in order to keep the discharge conservation , the reconstruction of the velocity has to be modified as @xmath58    if we take @xmath59 , we recover the first order scheme in space .",
    "the friction term is taken into account by a fractional step , with the following system @xmath60 this system is solved thanks to a semi - implicit method ( as in @xcite ) @xmath61 this method allows to preserve stability ( under a classical cfl condition ) and steady states at rest .",
    "finally a tvd - runge kutta method is applied to get second order in time . for the generalization to @xmath1d",
    ", we use the hllc flux introduced in combined with the method of lines . concerning boundary conditions ,",
    "we have modified the code , in order to have the discharge only in the riverbed , it is based on riemann invariants . finally , as we aim at simulating with big data , we have used a parallel version of fullswof based on a domain decomposition and the mpi library @xcite .      to create the hr dsm ,",
    "the following approach has been carried out .",
    "first , a dtm using multiple ground level information sources : points , polygons and polylines is created and provided at a @xmath62 m resolution by dignca .",
    "then , a selection procedure among classified data is performed .",
    "this selection is achieved by considering concrete elements which can influence overland flow drainage path only .",
    "it includes dikes , buildings , walls and `` concrete '' above ground elements ( such as sidewalks , road gutters , roundabound , doors steps , etc . ) .",
    "@xmath63 classes are selected among the @xmath18 classes of the @xmath0d photo - interpreted dataset ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . during this step ,",
    "polylines giving information on elevated roads and bridges , which might block overland flow paths , are removed .",
    "the remaining total number of polylines is @xmath64 after these two selection steps .",
    "d dataset selected classes at step two of the hr dsm creation before bridges and flow blocking macro - structures removal.,scaledwidth=92.0% ]    final step of hr dsm elaboration consists in extruding elevation information of selected polylines on the dtm . to proceed , features represented by closed lines are converted to polygons ( _ e.g. _ buildings , round abound , sidewalks ) .",
    "polylignes and polygons are then converted to raster at desired resolution ( here @xmath32 m resolution ) for extrusion over the dtm .",
    "eventually , hr dsm which has elevation information of selected @xmath0d classified features is produced ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the hr dsm resolution is here @xmath32 m. this choice of resolution is explained as follow : it will allow to integrate directly the hr dsm at desired regular mesh resolution in fullswof_2d . at this resolution",
    "the number of mesh cells is above @xmath65 millions .",
    "the previously described method has allowed inclusion of thin elements impacting flow behavior of infra - metric dimension , oversized to metric size , in the @xmath32 m resolution regular mesh .",
    "axis scale multiplied by @xmath1 for clarity of the @xmath0d rendering.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]      the @xmath66 to the @xmath67 of november @xmath6 , an important flood event has occurred in the low part of the var catchment .",
    "this historical flood event had severe consequences .",
    "the flood scenario for our tests is based on estimated hydrogram of this event @xcite . through our tests , we want to produce a hr map of maximal water depths reached in the low var valley , using the produced hr dsm with fullswof code .",
    "objective here is not to reproduce the flood event .",
    "indeed , the site changed a lot since @xmath6 : levees , dikes and urban structures have been intensively constructed in this area . to shorten the simulation length , we chose to simulate a @xmath68 hours scenario .",
    "first , a constant discharge of @xmath69 is run for @xmath0 hours to reach a steady state .",
    "then the overtopping part of the hydrogram is run , reaching the estimated pic discharge ( @xmath70 ) and then decreasing long enough to observe a diminution of the overland flow water depth .",
    "the manning - strickler @xmath71 coefficient is spatially uniform in overland flow areas .",
    "no energy loss properties have been included in the hydraulic model to represent the bridges piers effects .",
    "an overview of produced overland flow calculated maximal water depths is given in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "high resolution modeling of flood river event in an urban environment is of a great interest for urban planners as it allows producing detailed maps of maximal water elevations and maximal velocities maps for a given flood scenario .",
    "a proof of concept of @xmath0d hr classified data use for river flood modeling is given here .",
    "advantages of such an approach rely : ( @xmath2 ) possibility to include detailed surface elements influencing overland flow , and ( @xmath3 ) in automatization and modularity of class selection for hr dsm production .",
    "d global representation of flood extent ( b).,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    two limits , in our hr dsm created for our test study , have to be emphasized .",
    "( @xmath2 ) the riverbed section itself was filled by @xmath10 m to @xmath5 m of water at the time of the photogrammetric campaign",
    ". therefore the sections of the river are here underestimated , not without standing uncertainties the fact that changes in riverbed occur during a flood event .",
    "( @xmath3 ) bridges piers , reducing river section are not included in the hr dsm for our workability test .",
    "more generally speaking , several categories recommendation and limits deserved to be put to the light for practical engineering applications using such type of data . even though hr dsm has a high level of accuracy , hr @xmath0d data have different types of inherent errors .",
    "it includes white noise , biased , and punctual errors in measurement .",
    "second type of errors is related to photo - interpretation .",
    "it can be omission , addition or misclassification of elements .",
    "these types of errors can lead to important changes in overland flow path in the hydraulic calculation .",
    "moreover , criteria for photo - interpretation have to be checked as well as they can highly influence hr dsm . for instance a criteria ( for human operators or algorithm )",
    "might be to close a polyligne , if distance between two points is below a certain threshold .",
    "this will block entrance of water in a given area .",
    "moreover classification criteria for a given photo - interpreted data set might not have been created specifically for water modeling purpose .",
    "for instance what will be classified , as concrete wall , not be based on material criteria but on structure width / elevation ratio . in that case permeable structures , such as fences , can be classified as walls .",
    "finally , a limitation appears regarding bridges piers where information is not given by aerial techniques . the @xmath0d hr classified data are heavy and their manipulation for pre- and post - process is computational resources demanding .",
    "hr dsm use , with fully resolved @xmath1d swe codes at this scale , requires use of intensive calculation resources .",
    "a proof of concept of high resolution ( hr ) @xmath0d classified data use , to produce a hr dsm for river flood simulation in complex environment has been presented in this study .",
    "hydraulic modeling has been performed by adapting and using fullswof which is a code relying on fully resolved @xmath1d shallow water equations .",
    "interest has been keen on fullswof as his numerical properties of mass conservation , well - balancedness and positivity preservation are relevant for hr overland flow modeling in urban areas .",
    "a method to design a hr dsm including elements influencing overland flow has been presented .",
    "for such a purpose , workability of hr 3d classified topographic data use is relevant at this scale sub - city scale .",
    "existing limits in this approach are put to the light . these limits mainly consists in ( @xmath2 ) difficulty to handle this important amount of data , ( @xmath3 ) existence of unavoidable errors of classification in photo - interpretation , ( @xmath11 ) classification procedure which might not have been specifically designed criteria for hydraulic purpose .",
