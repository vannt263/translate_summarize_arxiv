    "disk accretion is attributed to cold cosmic flows @xcite and dwarf satellite capture @xcite through the virial radius , which may be 20 times larger than the disk ( see reviews in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not clear whether these flows reach the disk directly . @xcite and @xcite suggest that the magellanic stream breaks apart and gets ionized by hydrodynamic instabilities without falling onto the disk .",
    "@xcite also found substantial heating and ionization of the layers surrounding a cosmic cold flow in simulations of the milky way .",
    "the numerical algorithm used for the simulation might also be important ; the arepo code @xcite has such high resolution that the infalling gas breaks apart by instabilities and heats up before reaching the disk .",
    "these predictions are consistent with the observation that the inflow rate of neutral clouds around the milky way is small , @xmath0 yr@xmath1 @xcite , which is too low to maintain the star formation rate of several @xmath2 yr@xmath1 @xcite if that is the only gas that comes in .",
    "low accretion leads to a relatively rapid quenching of star formation , contradicting the observation that most disk galaxies form stars over a high fraction of the hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "cosmic simulations suggest that the accreting gas moves toward larger radii over time as the specific angular momentum of the remaining cosmic filament increases ; this leads to the popular picture of inside - out star formation @xcite .",
    "observations agree that accretion occurs today in the outer parts of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this causes a problem if most of the star formation takes place in the main disk , much further inward .",
    "why does the star formation rate equal the accretion rate , as analytical models suggest @xcite , if these rates occur in different locations ? one needs in - plane accretion at a comparable rate to deliver the fresh outer gas to the inner star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite discuss how this might happen using a model based on energy dissipation .",
    "@xcite consider in - plane accretion that is driven by disk torques from interacting clumps and turbulent viscosity .",
    "another model of disk accretion assumes that cosmic gas goes first into a hot halo and then condenses onto the disk in a second step via thermal cooling at the interface .",
    "a galactic fountain could provide the cool surface needed for this condensation @xcite .",
    "the fountain model avoids the question of whether the cosmic gas goes directly from the virial radius to the disk , and it avoids the problem of accretion onto the outer regions when the gas is needed in the inner regions to form stars .",
    "cosmic gas may be deposited in the far outer regions by cold streams while the inner disk is fed by condensing halo gas immediately adjacent to it .",
    "@xcite summarize the advantages of this model , including many comparisons to observations @xcite .",
    "halo condensation gives an accretion rate that is approximately proportional to the star formation rate at the same position , and therefore to the existing column density of molecular or self - gravitating gas .",
    "such a model sustains star formation in the main disk .",
    "cosmic accretion should generally have a different specific angular momentum than the part of the disk that receives it .",
    "there will be some generation of turbulence to dissipate the relative kinetic energy , and an inflow or outflow of the combined gas until radial force equilibrium is achieved in a new circular orbit . even in the fountain model , where the accreting gas in the disk comes directly from the adjacent rotating halo , the high velocity dispersion in the halo and the resulting radial pressure gradient",
    "cause it to rotate more slowly than the cold disk beneath it .",
    "the result will be a gradual shrinkage of the gas disk as it forms stars from condensing halo gas .",
    "this paper calculates the radial drift speed from halo condensation at the local star formation rate in order to determine how such a drift affects the radial profiles of the gaseous and stellar components of the disk .",
    "the results suggest a relatively long timescale for disk evolution forced this way , so the process may not have strong observational signatures in disks dominated by other torques , such as bars and spirals .",
    "however it may be evident in dwarf galaxies without these stellar structures .",
    "dwarf galaxy star formation also seems to proceed from the outside - in @xcite , as if following some inflowing gas , unlike the case in spiral galaxies .",
    "the star formation history in the large magellanic cloud shows an outside - in trend too , although interactions with the small magellanic cloud could be involved @xcite .",
    "other processes involving extra - planar gas should stimulate the same type of halo condensation and disk shrinkage .",
    "@xcite suggested that gas at the disk - halo interface follows the motions of spirals and bars , which concentrate star formation and increase the turbulent pressure locally .",
    "they model the resulting fountain and explain the vertical rotational velocity gradient that is observed in the interface region .",
    "@xcite simulated the generation of turbulence by instabilities at high latitude above spiral density wave shocks ; turbulent structures like this could enhance halo condensation too .    in what follows ,",
    "the equations for disk evolution driven by accretion of low angular momentum gas are solved for the case where the accretion rate is proportional to the local star formation rate .",
    "solutions are shown that include depletion of gas by star formation and disk winds , and with rates for accretion and star formation that change over cosmological time .",
    "we show that the star - forming part of the gas disk shrinks in a self - similar way throughout this process , which means that an initially exponential profile for this component stays exponential with a shrinking scale length .",
    "this is important because exponential profiles appear very early in the universe @xcite , perhaps as a result of clumpy disk dynamics @xcite , and subsequent accretion at the star formation rate should not distort this profile too much .",
    "specific applications to blue compact dwarfs are discussed in section [ bcdsection ] .",
    "we assume a that galactic disk accretes locally at a rate equal to @xmath3 in units of mass per area per time . in the fountain model",
    ", this accretion is affected primarily by the star - forming component of the disk , so we divide the gas column density into two components , @xmath4 for the star forming part , such as the molecular and self - gravitating clouds , and @xmath5 for the non - star - forming part , such as the atomic diffuse gas . these two components interchange mass and mix with accreted gas on dynamical timescales , but only the fraction of the total that is involved with star - formation will drive the accretion and get depleted as stars form .    with this assumption ,",
    "the star formation rate is @xmath6 , with a fraction @xmath7 of the forming stellar mass quickly returned to the gas in the form of supernovae and stellar winds . in general",
    ", there is also a disk wind .",
    "a common approximation is to use a mass loss rate in the wind proportional to the star formation rate , @xmath8 , for constant @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then the continuity equation for gas surface density , including radial drift speeds from angular momentum redistribution , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the star - forming and non - star - forming parts , is @xmath12    we also assume that cosmic accretion has some rotation speed , @xmath13 , that is not generally the same as the circular speed of gas that is already in the disk at that radius , @xmath14 .",
    "the equation for conservation of angular momentum for the two components is then @xmath15 the left - hand side of this equation is the time derivative of the local disk angular momentum , following the radial drift , and the right - hand side is the angular momentum added to this part of the disk .    assuming the circular speed changes only slowly with time , we separate @xmath16 from the first term on the left of equation ( [ ang ] ) and divide the whole equation by @xmath17 .",
    "a term like @xmath18 enters so we assume a power law rotation curve of the form @xmath19 , which makes this term equal to @xmath20 . with these modifications to equation ( [ ang ] )",
    "we subtract equation ( [ cont2 ] ) to eliminate @xmath21 , several common geometric terms , and the wind and star formation terms .",
    "the result is @xmath22 for the star - forming component .",
    "we also get @xmath23 for the non - star forming component , leaving @xmath5 unchanged , because it has no source terms on the right - hand sides of equations ( [ cont2 ] ) and ( [ ang ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the finding by @xcite , @xcite and others that the atomic phase of interstellar gas has approximately constant mass over time with the accretion feeding only the star formation component .",
    "our modification here is to consider that the accreted gas has a lower specific angular momentum than the disk gas , in which case the fraction of the disk mass involved with star formation moves inward to conserve total angular momentum ( eq .",
    "[ vrequation ] ) .",
    "this result is also consistent with the observation that the radial distribution of hi is usually much flatter than the molecular distribution , which matches that of the star formation rate and approximately also that of the underlying disk stars .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is proportional to the column density of disk gas that is involved with star formation , @xmath25 because of the galactic fountain process described in the introduction , along with a kennicutt - schmidt relation that is linear between the star formation rate and the dense component of the gas column density @xcite .    in the model by @xcite and collaborators ,",
    "the accreted gas is from a large reservoir in the hot halo , in which case it was formerly in hydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxy and did not have much rotational support .",
    "observations indicate a @xmath26%-20% slower rotation of the disk - halo interface than the disk itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this disk - halo interface is where the condensation of halo gas onto the fountain is presumably happening , so the rotation speed there is already a mixture of the disk speed from supernova and wind ejecta , and the halo speed from hot gas condensing onto it .",
    "the unseen halo speed is probably even lower than the observed interface speed . for simplicity",
    ", we write , @xmath27 in what follows , this ratio will only be compared to unity , so slightly different radial variations in @xmath13 and @xmath14 will not matter much .    the solution to equation ( [ vrequation ] ) is now @xmath28 we interpret this equation to mean that the star - forming part of the gas moves in at the speed @xmath10 .",
    "this does not mean that individual molecular clouds are drifting at that speed .",
    "as mentioned above , there should be a continuous mixing between the star - forming and diffuse parts following star formation , stellar gas return , molecular cloud disruption , and so on .",
    "thus , equation ( [ vrsol ] ) may also be interpreted to mean there is an inward drift of the whole interstellar medium at the speed @xmath29 , driven by the star - forming part through its interaction with the slower - moving halo .",
    "if accretion enables star formation at about the same rate , and star formation drives accretion as in the fountain model , then @xmath30 , giving @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we can equivalently interpret our equations to mean that the star formation rate scales linearly with the fraction @xmath32 of the total gas , and this fraction drifts at @xmath10 .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath33 implies a self similar shrinking . to solve for the resulting @xmath34 , we substitute @xmath10 into equation ( [ cont2 ] ) and simplify to get @xmath35 in the discussion above",
    ", the entire coefficient of the @xmath4 term on the right is independent of radius but not necessarily time , so we represent it by @xmath36 then we have an evolution equation of the form @xmath37 for dot and prime representing time and radial derivatives .",
    "the first term on the right can be eliminated by substituting @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 this equation is solved by setting @xmath40 equal to any function @xmath41 of the variable @xmath42 , because then @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus the star - forming part of the gas column density becomes    @xmath45    @xmath46 represents the radial profile at @xmath47 .",
    "we consider an initial profile that is exponential , so @xmath48 for @xmath49 and initial scale length @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 with exponentially shrinking scale length , @xmath52 , and initial central value @xmath53 .",
    "evidently , the accretion makes the central column density of this disk component increase with time as @xmath54 .",
    "because we have assumed @xmath55 to be independent of radius , the radial profile of the star - forming part of the disk is always exponential following an initial exponential shape , even as it shrinks with the accretion of low - angular momentum halo gas .",
    "we might expect @xmath55 to have some radial variation , however , even if the star formation rate is locally proportional to the accretion rate ( @xmath56 is constant ) , because of the likely radial variations of the rotation curve slope , @xmath20 , and the wind mass loading factor , @xmath9 ( cf . eqn .",
    "[ cala ] ) .",
    "the rotation curve should flatten with increasing @xmath33 , making @xmath20 decrease and @xmath57 increase .",
    "the wind factor should increase with @xmath33 as the disk material is less bound to the galaxy in the outer parts .",
    "these two effects compensate each other in @xmath58 .",
    "the other parameters , namely , the gas return fraction @xmath7 and the differential circular speed , @xmath59 should not vary as much ( especially if @xmath60 ) . also , @xmath61 is not observed to vary with radius in local disk galaxies for the star forming part of the interstellar medium , i.e. , the co - emitting gas @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath55 may not vary much .",
    "the effects of variable @xmath55 can be understood intuitively because the inflow speed @xmath62 scales with this quantity .",
    "locally high @xmath55 can make a trough , for example , by increasing the inflow rate through that region .",
    "the star - forming gas mass in the disk is @xmath63 showing the same exponential growth .",
    "this type of growth arises because the accretion rate is assumed to be proportional to the star - forming gas mass itself , by feedback through star formation , a galactic fountain , and condensation of halo gas onto the cool fountain debris .",
    "the accretion rate will generally change with time because both @xmath64 and the rate of cosmic accretion into the virial radius change .",
    "sample solutions derived numerically are shown in figures 1 and 2 for two models . on the left - hand side of each figure , we assume in the first model that the accretion rate equals the star formation rate , which gives @xmath65 .",
    "following @xcite , we use @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the hubble time . on the right - hand side of each figure , we assume in the second model that @xmath56 also scales with the halo accretion rate , normalized to the halo accretion rate at the present time : @xmath68 where @xcite @xmath69 @xmath70 is the mass of the halo in units of @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the redshift , related to the expansion time @xmath67 by @xmath73cdm cosmology from @xcite where @xmath74 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath75 .    for the evaluation of @xmath10 , we assume @xmath76 for all radii , so there is a 10% mismatch between the halo and disk spins .",
    "we also assume a flat rotation curve , @xmath77 , in figure 1 , and a solid body rotation curve , @xmath78 , in figure 2 . from equation ( [ vrsol ] ) ,",
    "we see that the evolution is slower for higher @xmath20 and lower @xmath79 .",
    "the starting time for the accretion is taken to correspond to a redshift of @xmath80 , which is in the clumpy disk phase when the smooth exponential disk starts to appear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all of the surface density profiles are normalized in the figures to the central value of the initial profile .",
    "the curves in the bottom panels show the instantaneous radial profiles at equally spaced times from the start ( green curve ) to today ( red curve ) .",
    "the profiles remain exponential as they steepen , as implied by equation [ solution ] .",
    "the top panels in the figures show the stellar surface densities calculated at each radius by integrating the local star formation rate over time , @xmath81 @xmath82 gyr at the start , where @xmath80 , and @xmath67 increases with cosmic time until today , when @xmath83 gyr . because @xmath4 is normalized to the central value at the start , the stellar surface density is not scaled to real units .",
    "we assume @xmath84 here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for the gas evolution equation ( [ sigmadot ] ) , @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the stellar profiles steepen with time , but they do not remain exponential like the gas because the stars have the gas profiles from the times when they formed .    also in the top panels , plotted with black curves and using the right - hand axes , are the average , mass - weighted ages of the stellar disks .",
    "the average ages are smaller near the center because the gas has moved in and formed an increasing proportion of stars there over time .",
    "this is outside - in star formation .",
    "surface density evolution by fountain - driven accretion is faster for more massive galaxies because of the @xmath86 term in @xmath10 ; massive galaxies tend to have flatter rotation curves in their bright inner regions @xcite .",
    "the age dip at the center is also sharper for higher mass galaxies , for the same reason .",
    "because we have ignored bulge formation and other accretion processes that happened earlier , the present results are only meant to show the part of the evolution from fountain - driven accretion",
    ".      there could be an application to late - type galaxies .",
    "blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) have high ratios of gas mass to star mass , low metallicities , nearly solid - body rotation curves , and a generally young appearance .",
    "they also have steeper and bluer exponential profiles in the inner disk than the outer disk @xcite .",
    "dwarf irregulars tend to have bluer inner regions too , suggesting outside - in star formation @xcite .",
    "for example , the far ultraviolet scale lengths for low mass galaxies are about half the 3.6@xmath87 m scale lengths , unlike the case for high - mass galaxies where these scale lengths are about the same @xcite .",
    "low mass galaxies have weak or no spiral arms to drive a radial evolution , and they have sustained star formation at a steady , though bursty , rate all of their lives . if the freshly accreted gas that drives star formation has relatively low angular momentum , then there could have been a radial accretion like that discussed here .",
    "figure 3 shows the radial profiles of stellar mass surface density in four dwarf galaxies with type iii stellar surface brightness profiles : exponential profiles with radius that have an abrupt break and become shallower in the outer disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these profiles are common among bcds or dwarf galaxies with significant central star formation ( current or past ) .",
    "haro 29 and ngc 3738 are classical bcds with young central parts and older , smooth outer parts @xcite .",
    "ngc 1569 is a young starburst @xcite , and ddo 70 is a relatively normal dwarf irregular with evidence for an event in the past that produced an enhancement in the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "each galaxy has steeper surface brightness and stellar mass surface density profiles in the inner disk compared to the outer disk , presumably because of some accretion that led to the starburst there .",
    "the observed mass surface density profiles are shown as red curves ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compared to theoretical models of stellar surface density calculated as above .",
    "the models fitted the inner and outer slopes primarily by adjusting the accretion history .",
    "all models had the same values of @xmath88 ( a relatively large angular momentum mismatch between the halo and the disk ) , @xmath89 ( a slowly rising rotation curve ) , @xmath90 ( a relatively strong wind for these small galaxies , i.e. , @xmath91 as above but now @xmath92 for the wind ) , and a redshift of 2 at the start of the evolution , as above .",
    "the two galaxies with the relatively small increase of slope in the center , ddo 70 and ngc 1569 , assume @xmath93 without the cosmic accretion multiplier in equation ( [ a2 ] ) , while the two galaxies with large increases of slope in the center , haro 29 and ngc 3738 , assume @xmath93 up to 1 gyr ago and then a burst of accretion toward the end with 10 times this rate . in the figure ,",
    "the top blue curve is the one corresponding to the present time , while the other curves show the evolution in equal time steps .",
    "these simple models fit haro 29 and ddo 70 very well ( haro 29 has a small centrally flat part for which we have artificially moved the galaxy profile slightly to the left in the figure ) . for ngc 1569 and ngc 3738",
    ", the models fit the outer profiles well , but produce inner mass profiles that are slightly less massive than what are observed with roughly the same average slope .",
    "thus , aside from some irregularities in the profiles , fits to the average inner and outer slopes are possible with the accretion model .",
    "galaxies with steeper inner profiles have a larger recent influx of low angular momentum gas .",
    "if the influx is steady , then the stars build up with a steadily decreasing scale length and there is a more gradual transition between the inner and outer parts .    also shown in figure 3",
    "are the gas surface density profiles derived from the deprojected hi mass surface densities multiplied by 1.36 to account for helium and heavy elements .",
    "these profiles go out much further in radius than the stellar parts shown in the panels below each one .",
    "they are plotted in physical units , @xmath2 pc@xmath94 , using the left - hand axes . the molecular gas surface density , which presumably follows the star formation rate and inner stellar disk better , is probably much lower than the hi+he surface density throughout most of the plotted region .",
    "the hi+he profile is not exponential even though the profile of star formation rate is ( h@xmath95 profiles are in * ? ? ?",
    "the interstellar matter in galactic gas disks should migrate inward if the disk accretes from the halo regions at slightly lower specific angular momentum .",
    "accretion at the disk - halo interface @xcite could cause such migration and have a noticeable effect on the stellar age distribution after several gyr .",
    "we have shown that this process preserves the exponential shape of the star - forming part of a gas disk initially in this form , while shrinking the disk scale length to conserve angular momentum .",
    "the radial drift speed is small , on the order of the disk size divided by the hubble time , or @xmath96 km s@xmath1 .",
    "gas consumption by star formation and gas expulsion by disk winds do not change the exponential shape nor the rate of evolution of the scale length ; they only change the absolute value of the surface density .",
    "fits of the model to bcd galaxies can account for the steep inner stellar profiles of those galaxies while explaining the origin of the dense gas in the center that drives the starburst ."
