    "gravitational interactions involving `` hard '' binary stars ( i.e.those with orbital velocities that exceed the local velocity dispersion ) provide the energy source that drives globular cluster evolution from the time that the cluster core approaches collapse @xcite .",
    "these interactions have a profound effect on the long - term fates of both the cluster and the binaries . among the hardest binaries in clusters are compact , accretional x - ray sources .",
    "bright low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which contain a neutron star primary , are strongly overabundant in dense clusters and thus almost certainly have a dynamical origin there ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . there is also growing evidence that a majority of the more numerous cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in clusters may also have a dynamical origin , rather than representing a primordial population @xcite .",
    "this is a complex issue , given the many possible channels for the formation of cvs in clusters , which include : the evolution of primordial binaries , mediated by hardening interactions ; exchange interactions between singles and primordial binaries , possibly involving multiple exchanges ; tidal captures which do not result in mergers ; and three - body interactions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "deep surveys of compact binary populations in globular clusters will help to clarify the relative importance of these cv formation mechanisms .",
    "ngc 6397 is the second closest globular cluster ( @xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is by far the nearest cluster to have undergone core collapse .",
    "it thus provides a special laboratory for studying the formation and evolution of compact binary systems in the extreme environment of a collapsed core .",
    "ngc  6397 has been a key target for _ rosat _ , hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) , and chandra x - ray observatory ( _ chandra _ ) studies of compact binaries in clusters .",
    "@xcite first detected cataclysmic variables in ngc  6397 , as counterparts to faint _",
    "rosat _  sources , using _",
    "hst _  wide - field / planetary camera  1  and @xmath0-band imaging to select -excess objects .",
    "@xcite confirmed the power of the  photometric technique , providing _",
    "_  faint object spectrograph verification of the first three cv identifications in ngc  6397 .",
    "@xcite carried out the first _ chandra _  observations of ngc  6397 , which detected a rich population of 25 sources within the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath3 = 2.33 ; * ? ? ?",
    "wfpc2 imaging in , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 has led to the identification of many of these sources , including nine cvs and a number of active binaries @xcite .",
    "since the study by @xcite was carried out , we have obtained considerably deeper _ chandra _  and _ hst _  imaging of ngc  6397 .",
    "the results of the _ chandra _  imaging , which detected 79 sources within the half - mass radius , are reported by @xcite .",
    "these x - ray sources , designated by a prefix u , are listed in table  [ t : counterparts ] . in this paper , we report a search for optical counterparts to these sources using a deep _ hst _  acs / wfc dataset .",
    "we describe the data , the analysis method , and the results in the following sections .",
    "the optical imaging used in this study is the _ hst _  go-10257 dataset ( pi : anderson ) , which provides deep , highly dithered acs / wfc imaging of the central region of ngc  6397 in f435w ( @xmath1 ) , f625w ( @xmath0 ) , and f658n ( ) .",
    "one of the main motivations of this study was to search for wobbles in the positions of stars , indicative of massive unseen companions , such as white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes . to provide good time sampling ,",
    "the center of ngc 6397 was imaged over 10 single - orbit epochs , spaced at approximately one - month intervals between 2004 july and 2005 june .",
    "a by product of this observing strategy is that we imaged the cluster at many different orientations , allowing for an exquisite mitigation of detector - dependent photometric and psf - related errors .",
    "in addition , the stacked images show round psfs with no sign of diffraction spikes .",
    "the dataset consists of 5 short @xmath1 ( 13s ) , 5 long @xmath1 ( 340s ) , 5 short @xmath0 ( 10s ) , 5 long r ( 340s ) , and 40  ( 390s ) exposures .",
    "the short exposures were designed to provide accurate photometry for stars above the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "saturation only becomes an issue near the tip of the giant branch . with the large number of  frames , the psf sampling is particularly good for this band",
    "the _ hst _  data were analyzed using software based on the program developed for the acs globular cluster treasury project , described in @xcite .",
    "the routine first finds the astrometric and photometric mapping from each exposure into a master reference frame .",
    "it then searches through the master reference frame one small patch at a time , identifying stars where a significant number of exposures indicate coincident detections .",
    "these stars are then measured two ways : ( 1 ) they are measured in each individual exposure where they could be found , and ( 2 ) they are also measured simultaneously in all the exposures ( which provides a better measurement for the fainter stars ) .",
    "stars were measured with spatially variable , library psfs ( see anderson & king acs isr 2006 - 01 ) constructed from the go-9444 data set ( pi - cool ) of @xmath6cen , using an aperture of whole pixels that was optimized for the brightness of the star and its particular surroundings .    since our best coverage was in , we did our star - finding on those images , and then used the positions found to identify and measure the stars in the b and r images .",
    "the final photometry we report here comes from averaging the photometry from the individual stars , with sigma clipping applied to remove outlying values due to cosmic rays , defective pixels , etc .",
    "a total of 25004 stars were detected .",
    "for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands , the photometry was performed independently for the short and long frames .",
    "photometric calibration to the vegamag system was adopted from @xcite .",
    "in addition to the star finding and measuring , we also produced stacked images of the scene , in a procedure that is akin to the iraf / stsdas _ drizzle _ algorithm with pixfrac set to zero .",
    "the stacked images were oversampled by a factor of two , in order to take advantage of the heavy dithering to increase the effective resolution .",
    "the resulting supersampled stacked images have a 12,000@xmath712,000 format and cover an approximately circular field of diameter 5  with a pixel scale of 0.025 .",
    "figures [ f : mosaic ] and [ f : mosaic_zoom ] show a combination of the 40  images , together with the error circles for the 79 _ chandra _  sources .",
    "the error circles are plotted at their actual sizes in both figures . as can be seen in these figures , the combination of images at various orientations results in a very smooth symmetric psf , with a distinct lack of diffraction spikes .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) were constructed from the photometry using the @xmath0 magnitudes , and the  and  color indices .",
    "the short - exposure @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes were used for stars brighter than about 2.5 mag below the msto , since the long - exposure frames saturate above this point .",
    "figures [ f : cmd_cv ] and [ f : cmd_ab ] show the resulting cmds .",
    "the efficacy of the photometric procedure is indicated by the tightness of the fiducial sequences .",
    "no proper - motion cleaning has been performed at this point in the analysis .",
    "proper - motion determination is described in  [ astrometry ] . in  [ source_id ]",
    "we will use proper motions in our source identification .",
    "unfortunately the quality of the cluster - field separation depends too sensitively on brightness to provide a definitive membership determination for all stars .",
    "the ( , @xmath0 ) cmd reaches deepest for the bluest stars , since the faintest red main - sequence ( ms ) stars are below the detection limit in @xmath1 . the upper part of the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling sequence is clearly detected in the ( , @xmath0 ) cmd , extending to nearly 10 mag below the msto in @xmath0 .",
    "there is also an indication of a second wd sequence above the primary sequence , which @xcite interpret as a he wd sequence .",
    "note that in the ( , @xmath0 ) cmd , the wds lie to the -deficit side of the ms , reflecting the strong  absorption lines in wd spectra relative to those of faint ms stars .",
    "the blue stragglers and the blue horizontal branch stars similarly lie to the -deficit sides of the subgiant branch and the giant branch , respectively .              the stacked _ hst _  acs / wfc images for each filter were rectified to a common astrometric system .",
    "we calculated an absolute astrometric zeropoint for the stacked images relative to the icrs using a two - step process .",
    "we first computed a plate solution for an eso wfi frame ( wfi.2002 - 06 - 21t01:45:08.153 ) using 357 primary astrometric standards from the usno ucac2 catalog .",
    "we then selected 350 secondary astrometric standards from the wfi frame and used these to compute a plate solution for our stacked acs / wfc images .",
    "we determined a boresight correction for the _ chandra _  source coordinates from @xcite by computing the mean offsets between the _ hst _  and _ chandra _  coordinates for the six brightest cvs and the millisecond pulsar ( msp ) psr  j1740 - 5340 .",
    "this resulted in a shift of the _ chandra _  coordinates to the icrs of @xmath8 in ra and @xmath9 in dec , where the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviations of the offsets for the seven objects .",
    "as an external test of our boresight correction , we note that our optical position for psr  j1740 - 5340 agrees with that of @xcite to @xmath10 in ra and @xmath11 in dec .",
    "they followed a similar astrometric procedure to what we used , with wfpc2 rather than acs / wfc imaging .",
    "we searched for optical counterparts to the _ chandra _  sources by overlaying the _ chandra _  error circles on the _ hst _  stacked images , with the boresight correction applied to the _ chandra _  source positions from @xcite .",
    "the 95% confidence error circle sizes were computed following @xcite . since the uncertainty in the optical positions @xmath12 ) was small compared with the size of the x - ray error circle radii ( @xmath13 ) , we neglected the contribution of the former to the total positional uncertainty .",
    "a preliminary proper - motion analysis was carried out in order to do a first - pass cluster - field separation .",
    "the present dataset was used for the reference epoch , with the stellar positions averaged over the 10 orbits .",
    "two different datasets were considered for the second epoch , go-7335 ( obtained with the wfpc2 in 1999 ) and go-10775 ( obtained with the acs / wfc in 2006 ) .",
    "the former provides a longer time baseline , while the later provides more depth and spatial coverage . to compute proper motions",
    ", we measured stars in each early - epoch exposure image , corrected these positions for distortion , then transformed these positions into the reference frame using linear transformations based on only cluster members . by using only members to define the transformations , we automatically get displacements ( and hence motions ) with respect to the cluster s systemic motion .    the cluster - field separation that can be achieved for moderately bright stars is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : pm ] , which shows the proper - motion distribution for stars with @xmath14 . cluster and field regions are defined by a magnitude - dependent radius about the centroids of the apparent cluster and field clumps . stars that do not reside in either of these regions are considered to have an unknown proper - motion membership status .",
    "since the proper - motion error increases with magnitude , this proper - motion separation becomes less effective with increasing magnitude .",
    "eventually the cluster and field regions of the proper - motion plane show a strong overlap .",
    "it was generally possible to obtain an approximate discrimination between cluster and field stars to a limiting magnitude of @xmath15 .",
    "in a few cases where the 2006-second - epoch results were resulted in an unknown proper - motion membership status , the 1999-second - epoch results were definitive .",
    "optical cmds provide a powerful means of selecting likely _ chandra _  source counterparts and investigating their properties . for each of the 79",
    "_ chandra _  sources within the half - mass radius , we checked the locations of all objects within the x - ray error circle in the cmds shown in figures  [ f : cmd_cv ] and [ f : cmd_ab ] .",
    "objects that fell on the main sequence were considered to be unlikely counterparts , given the relatively low x - ray to optical flux ratio , @xmath16 , of most ms stars , in contrast to the ranges for chromospherically active binaries and cataclysmic variables .",
    "table  [ t : counterparts ] summarizes the result of this counterpart search .",
    "plausible identifications were obtained for nearly all sources and are listed in this table , along with previous source designations , inferred object types , proper - motion information , and photometry .",
    "the only sources for which the error circle was empty are the quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( qlmxb ) u24 @xcite , u104 , u106 , u111 , u113 , u119 , u121 , u122 , and u123 . in the case of u24",
    ", there is a small `` blip '' near the center of the error circle in the stacked @xmath0 image , but it likely represents the combination of airy ring artifacts from two bright nearby stars .",
    "several other sources , u5 , u16 , u77 , and u84 , lie outside of the @xmath0 field and thus are difficult to classify , from these data , due to the lack of  and  color measurements .",
    "however , the u5 and u77 counterparts , v30 and v36 respectively , have been shown to be variable using ground - based photometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified v30 as an eclipsing binary that lies to the far red of the main sequence ( suggestive of it being a non - member )",
    ". @xcite have recently classified v36 as a single - line spectropsopic binary .",
    "we have classified both of these stars as uncertain active binaries ( abs ) . u5 and u84 have very red @xmath17 colors , suggesting that their  colors are likely very red as well , which supports an ab identification .",
    "table  [ t : counterparts ] also gives a summary of the results of the proper - motion analysis , which indicates whether the object is consistent with being a cluster member , a field member , or neither , based on a comparison of its proper motion to the proper - motion distribution for stars of similar magnitude .",

    "similarly , an apparent msto star is the only object present in the error circle for source u118 .",
    "we note that an ab with a low mass ratio and weak lines could look like a ms star in both cmds .",
    "two objects , u28 and u108 , were classified as background galaxies based on the extended appearance of their images .",
    "u28 resembles an edge - on spiral , while u108 has a more complex structure suggestive of interacting galaxies .",
    "the high x - ray to optical flux ratio of u28 ( see  [ flux_ratio ] ) suggests that it is an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "while the flux ratio of u108 was not determined , due to the complex nature of the optical image , it is clearly much lower than that of u28 .",
    "one possibility is that we are detecting x - ray emission from u108 that is produced by a galaxy collision .",
    "figure  [ f : cmd_cv ] shows the location of the cv candidates in the cmds . there is a suggestion of an evolutionary sequence from young , bright cvs to old , faint ones .",
    "we return to this point in  [ summary ] .",
    "the six brightest cvs mostly lie about 0.2  0.8 mag to the blue of the ms .",
    "the optical emission of the systems appears to be dominated by the secondary in the @xmath0 band , with a larger contribution from the disk in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the fairly high @xmath0-band flux indicates that the secondaries are relatively massive , @xmath21 , as inferred from the isochrones of @xcite .",
    "all of the bright cvs have substantial  excesses relative to the ms ; these excesses generally increase with magnitude .",
    "the cv candidates 18 are numbered according to the scheme used in previous papers , as listed by @xcite .",
    "a prefix cv is used to designate each cv candidate .",
    "@xcite identify u28 as a cv ; however we find that this chandra source appears to be a galaxy . here",
    "we use the identification by @xcite of u60 as cv9 .",
    "cvs 1015 are newly identified in the present study ; @xcite assigned numbers for cvs 10 and 11 .",
    "we have numbered cvs 1215 based on optical luminosity within this group .",
    "the translation between _ chandra _  source numbers and cv numbers is given in table  [ t : counterparts ] .",
    "there is a two magnitude gap between the bright cvs and the fainter cvs . just below this gap",
    "are two possible transitional objects , u7 and u61 , which lie between the white dwarf sequence and the main sequence .",
    "we note that the proper - motion data produce an unknown membership status for u61 , while u7 registers as consistent with membership .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that u61 is a background agn with an emission line that is shifted into the  window .",
    "however , the image of the u61 counterpart does not show obvious evidence of extension .",
    "the fainter cv candidates , below u7 and u61 , lie in the vicinity of the wd cooling sequence .",
    "the optical fluxes for the faint cv candidates are clearly dominated by the contribution of the wd .",
    "the  indices for these faint cvs nearly all lie at least 0.5 mag to the  excess side of the wd clump , which is centered at about @xmath22 .",
    "this suggests that the faint cvs have a strong -emission core ( due to an accretion disk ) within the broad absorption lines of the wd continuum .",
    "this inferred spectroscopic property of the faint cvs appears to be generally consistent with those of the wz sge class of evolved cataclysmic variable @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that some of these objects are am  cvn type double - degenerate systems , in which a low - mass he  wd donor feeds a much more massive carbon - oxygen wd .",
    "such systems show no evidence of hydrogen lines in their spectra and instead have he  i and sometimes he  ii lines , which are typically in emission @xcite .",
    "am  cvn stars could have evolved into contact from the known he  wds in ngc  6397 , which have been shown to have ( detached ) heavy co wd companions @xcite .",
    "such an object should lie close to the main sequence in the @xmath23 cmd .",
    "possible candidate am  cvn stars among the cv candidates reported here are u25 , u31 , u60 , u80 , and u83 .",
    "we note that most of the wd - like cv candidates cluster near a magnitude of @xmath24 , which corresponds to a @xmath25 , using the distance modulus determined by @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite have reported a sharp peak ( `` spike '' ) near the period minimum ( @xmath26 ) in the period distribution of cvs selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the average absolute magnitude for the cvs in the spike is @xmath27 . allowing for the difference in photometric band ,",
    "this is reasonably close to the characteristic magnitude of the faint cvs in our study .",
    "this suggests that these faint cvs may well belong to the spike population , i.e.  have periods in the vicinity of the period minimum .",
    "this could be tested by determining orbital periods for the faint cvs from suitable time - resolved photometry .",
    "@xcite find that of 33 cvs with orbital periods less than 86  min , 20 have spectra that are wd - dominated . in our sample , it appears that all seven faint cvs are wd - dominated .",
    "given the small sample size , it is not clear whether this represents a significant difference between faint field and faint cluster cvs .",
    "figure  [ f : cmd_ab ] shows the location of the objects identified as ab stars in the cmds .",
    "we note that these objects sometimes lie near the edge of the ms in either the right or left panel , but deviate by a larger amount in the other panel .",
    "of the 42 ab counterparts listed in table  [ t : counterparts ] , 26 are newly identified in our study .",
    "overall , the abs appear to form a relatively homogeneous binary sequence alongside the ms , presumably mostly differing in mass .",
    "@xcite have argued that these stars are likely by draconis stars and represent a hard binary population in ngc  6397 . in a large study of photometric variability in 47  tuc",
    ", @xcite found a substantial population of by draconis binaries , as well as w uma and other contact binaries , and eclipsing binaries .",
    "in addition to the likely by dra population , there are a number of counterparts that show a significantly different distribution in the cmd .",
    "these include the `` red straggler '' counterpart to u12 ( the millisecond pulsar ) and the similar counterpart to u18 , the blue - straggler counterpart to u70 , a group of five stars with very red colors , and a group of five stars with strong  excesses .",
    "there are two stars in common between these latter two groups .",
    "the counterparts to u12 and u18 both have proper motions consistent with cluster membership .",
    "given their similar optical and x - ray properties , it appears likely that u18 is a msp @xcite .",

    "the he  wd candidate pc-5 @xcite , which has been previously suggested as a possible counterpart to u70 , lies well outside of the current error circle .",
    "the counterparts to u42 , u63 , u65 , u86 , and u92 differ strikingly from the typical abs , lying up to 1 mag to the red of the ms , and thus well above it . of these , the counterparts to u42 and u92 have been previously identified as optically variable stars @xcite , as confirmed here ( see  [ variability ] and fig .",
    "[ f : variability ] ) ; the counterparts to u63 , u65 , and u86 are new identifications .",
    "the u92 counterpart ( v7 ) is classified as a w uma system by @xcite , while the u42 counterpart ( v26 ) is classified as an irregular variable by @xcite .",
    "u92 is consistent with the cluster proper - motion distribution .",
    "the proper - motion information available for u42 , u65 , and u86 produce an unknown membership status .",
    "these stars have proper motions that are well outside of the cluster distribution but they are also inconsistent with the field distribution .",
    "there is no proper - motion information for u63 .",
    "one reasonable possibility is that these stars are foreground active binaries superposed on the cluster , as discussed by @xcite in the case of u5 ( v30 ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the foreground binaries contain k / m type dwarfs with distance moduli that put them well above the cluster main sequence in the @xmath30 cmd .",
    "figure  [ f : cmd_ab ] also shows several ab candidates that have larger than typical  excesses ; these include the counterparts to u62 , u65 , u66 , u86 , and u120 .",
    "there is no proper - motion information available for u62 .",
    "the proper - motion information for u65 , u86 , and u120 produces an unknown membership status .",
    "u66 is consistent with the field proper - motion distribution .",
    "thus , the proper - motion information does not offer much assistance in determining whether these stars are likely cluster members .",
    "@xcite have drawn attention to two of the variable stars that we have identified as ab counterparts , v17 and v36 , which correspond to the sources u76 and u77 . these similar objects both lie close to the main - sequence turnoff in the cmd presented by @xcite .",
    "both objects are single - line spectroscopic binaries , in which the unseen primary is inferred to have a mass in excess of 1  .",
    "they suggest that these two objects are members of a class of dormant degenerate binaries which may have much larger peak x - ray luminosities .      as an additional aid to the classification of sources",
    ", we have examined the x - ray to optical flux ratio , @xmath16 , where we take @xmath31 from @xcite and set @xmath32 .",
    "the latter conversion factor is computed from the _ hst _  flux calibration constants .",
    "the x - ray count to flux transformation assumes a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the resulting flux ratio is plotted versus @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ f : fx_fopt ] .",
    "the ratio is observed to be higher for accretional sources , such as cvs , lmxbs , and agns , than for chromospherically active binaries ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * who studied the _",
    "chandra _  source distribution in m4 ) .",
    "consistent with this , fig .",
    "[ f : fx_fopt ] shows that the cv and ab candidates form two distinct groups with no overlap in flux ratio .",
    "the median flux ratio is about 500 times larger for the cvs than for the abs . within each group",
    "there is a broad range of the flux ratio , about a factor of 40 for the cvs and a factor of 100 for the abs .",
    "there is no apparent dependence of the flux ratio on @xmath34 over a range of more than three decades in @xmath34 for the cvs and nearly two decades for the abs .",
    "the apparent agn , u28 , has the highest flux ratio of all objects .",
    "the known millisecond pulsar , u12 , has a higher flux ratio than most of the abs and is about 40@xmath7 brighter in the x - ray than a typical ab .",
    "the object u18 , which has a similar optical counterpart to that of u12 , has even higher values of @xmath34 and @xmath16 .",
    "this supports the interpretation of u18 as a msp not yet detected at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray flux of cv5 ( u22 ) is considerably lower in the 2007 observations than in the previous 2002 observations ; the flux differs more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this gives cv5 the lowest @xmath16 value of all the cvs when the 2007 x - ray flux is used together with the 2004 - 05 optical flux . since the x - ray and optical fluxes were not measured contemporaneously , it is possible that cv5 typically has a flux ratio that is more consistent with the other bright cvs .",
    "we note that the x - ray flux of a bright cv typically drops during outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that cv5 may have been in outburst in 2007 . the objects u62 , u66 , and u86 , which lie among the abs with the four highest flux ratios , all have significantly larger  excesses than the typical ab .",
    "it is not surprising that two measures of chromospheric activity , x - ray flux and  flux , are correlated for these stars .",
    "since our dataset provides a 40-exposure time sequence of  exposures , with four exposures per orbit , it was possible to investigate optical variability . the time sequence samples time scales shorter than about one hour ( the visibility period per _ hst _  orbit ) and also time scales from one month to one year .",
    "the analysis of variability is complicated by the presence of outliers in the time sequences , some of which represent photometric anomalies .",
    "we investigated several measures of variability and adopted the rms deviation about the mean of the  magnitude measurements , computed using an iterative 3@xmath35 clip to reduce the impact of outliers .",
    "we plot @xmath36 versus mean  magnitude in figure  [ f : variability ] .",
    "this procedure results in a measure of variability that is most sensitive to orbital variability of binary systems , rather than large - amplitude fluctuations of cvs , given the outlier filtering .",
    "thus , we also investigated the total range of the  magnitudes for each object and constructed light curves for each of the cv candidates in order to test for outburst behavior .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : variability ] , most stars fall on a well - defined sequence of increasing @xmath36 with increasing magnitude .",
    "stars that lie significantly above this sequence generally show evidence for variability , although some of this scatter is likely due to photometric issues .",
    "we note that the mean trend of the variability index @xmath36 with mean @xmath37 magnitude differs for stars brighter than @xmath38 , for which @xmath36 increases from a minimum of about 0.003 mag to about 0.04 mag for the brightest stars plotted .",
    "this behavior for bright stars is due to saturation issues that increase in size with decreasing magnitude .",
    "we have plotted the positions of the previous and new chandra source counterparts in fig .",

    "we note that the results of this analysis agree with the k - s comparison results given in the last column of the table .",
    "the inferred mass range for the bright cvs ( @xmath88 ) is consistent with a system made up of a heavy white dwarf ( e.g.  @xmath89 ) with a main sequence secondary of mass @xmath90 .",
    "the inferred mass range for the faint cvs ( @xmath91 ) is consistent with a somewhat less massive white dwarf ( e.g  @xmath92 ) and a secondary mass that has been whittled down to @xmath93 .",
    "in such a system , the optical flux would be dominated by the white dwarf , as observed here .",
    "we presume that the white dwarf in this case has been heated by the accretion process , since noninteracting heavy white dwarfs are too faint to detect due to the degree of cooling that has occurred over their long lifetimes .",
    "as discussed in  [ source_types ] , an alternative interpretation is that some of the cvs are am  cvn systems , in which the secondary is a he  wd . in this case",

    "have determined the masses of the wds in seven cvs that lie below period gap , with a resulting mean mass and standard deviation of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , given the uncertainty ranges in the cv masses inferred here , our results for likely wd masses are generally consistent with these measured wd masses .",
    "we have shown that with moderately deep @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and _",
    "hst_-acs / wfc imaging , it is possible to identify and classify nearly all of the 79 currently detected _ chandra _  sources within the half - mass radius of ngc  6397 .",
    "our classifications are based on cmd location and are tested for consistency with expected ranges of the x - ray to optical flux ratio . in only a few cases was it not possible to classify the source , generally due to a lack of coverage in one filter .",
    "the vast majority of the sources in the cluster can be classified as either cataclysmic variables ( a total of 15 ) or active binaries ( a total of 42 ) . the x - ray to optical flux ratio for the cvs ( 0.2  6 ) substantially exceeds that for most of the abs ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "there is one previously known msp and one potential msp ; the latter classification is based on the similar photometric properties of the two objects .",
    "the proper - motion test for cluster membership produces an unknown status for many of the _ chandra _  source counterparts .",
    "this is largely a consequence of the short time baseline of 1.5 years between the two epochs of acs / wfc data used for determining proper motions . while the 1999 wfpc2 observations give a longer baseline , fewer stars are detected by the wfpc2 .",
    "thus , the proper - motion part of this study would benefit substantially from new _ hst _",
    "observations of ngc  6397 with either the acs / wfc or the wfc3 . while it appears likely that the vast majority of the proposed counterparts are cluster members , proper - motion confirmation would be valuable",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to know how many of the atypical abs are cluster members .",
    "while it is likely that most are foreground stars , one of the very red ones has appears to be a member on the basis of our preliminary proper - motion measurements .",
    "the cv distribution in ngc 6397 has a bimodal character .",
    "we detect distinct bright and faint populations with only two possible transition objects .",
    "the optical emission of the six brightest cvs appears to be dominated by a relatively massive secondary , while that of the faint cvs appears to be dominated by the wd , with very little contribution from a very low - mass secondary .",
    "alternatively , some of the faint cvs may be am  cvn systems , with a he  wd secondary .",
    "the distribution of cvs in optical luminosity and color is consistent with expected cv evolution due to the effects of mass transfer and angular momentum loss . as cvs age and",
    "the secondary loses mass to the primary , the orbit tightens due to magnetic braking and ultimately gravitational wave radiation . in this picture , the bright cvs 16 represent young , recently formed systems , while the faint cvs represent old , highly evolved systems . while cvs can be born at any orbital period , depending on the nature of the secondary star , there is a bias for cvs formed in exchange interactions in collapsed cluster cores to have more massive secondaries and thus longer orbital periods than newly formed field cvs .",
    "this is both the result of mass segregation in the cluster , which may invert the mass function in the cluster core , and of the tendency for more massive stars to displace less massive ones in exchange interactions .",
    "thus , while it is possible for a faint cv to be a young system , we expect that the bulk of the faint cvs evolved from an earlier bright state .",
    "given the likely ongoing formation of cvs by dynamical processes in the central region of the cluster , it is plausible that we are observing a roughly equilibrium cv population in ngc 6397 .",
    "however , there remains a possibility that the current population of six bright cvs represents the result of a recent core collapse event that resulted in an enhanced production of cvs . in this case",
    ", the bright cvs would be overpopulous relative to the faint cvs .",
    "the six brightest cvs in ngc  6397 have a much more centrally concentrated spatial distribution than do either the fainter cvs or the abs .",
    "indeed , five of six bright cvs are located within about 2@xmath70 of the cluster center , while all but one of the fainter cvs lie outside of 4@xmath70 .",
    "this suggests that cvs are preferentially formed by dynamical processes within the core and surrounding region and migrate to larger radii as they age and undergo repeated scattering interactions that act to increase the typical size of their orbits in the cluster potential . since repeated strong interactions between compact binaries and other stars",
    "ultimately result in the ejection of the binaries from clusters , the lifetime of a compact binary in a cluster is extended if the amount of time it spends in the central region of the cluster is reduced .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that long - lived cvs in globular clusters should generally be found outside of the densest regions .",
    "this is consistent with the spatial distribution of the cvs in ngc  6397 .          ,",

    "<S> we have searched for optical identifications for 79 _ chandra _  x - ray sources that lie within the half - mass radius of the nearby , core - collapsed globular cluster ngc 6397 , using deep hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys wide field channel imaging in , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> photometry of these images allows us to classify candidate counterparts based on color - magnitude diagram location . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to recovering nine previously detected cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , we have identified six additional faint cv candidates , a total of 42 active binaries ( abs ) , two millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , one candidate active galactic nucleus , and one candidate interacting galaxy pair . </S>",
    "<S> of the 79 sources , 69 have a plausible optical counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> the 15 likely and possible cvs in ngc 6397 mostly fall into two groups : a brighter group of six for which the optical emission is dominated by contributions from the secondary and accretion disk , and a fainter group of seven for which the white dwarf dominates the optical emission . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible transitional objects that lie between these groups . </S>",
    "<S> the faintest cvs likely lie near the minimum of the cv period distribution , where an accumulation is expected . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the brighter cvs is much more centrally concentrated than those of the fainter cvs and the active binaries . </S>",
    "<S> this may represent the result of an evolutionary process in which cvs are produced by dynamical interactions , such as exchange reactions , near the cluster center and are scattered to larger orbital radii , over their lifetimes , as they age and become fainter . </S>"
