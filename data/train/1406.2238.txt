    "imagine that we destroy a connected graph by removing or cutting its edges one after the other , in a uniform random order .",
    "the study of such a procedure was initiated by meir and moon in @xcite .",
    "they were interested in the number of steps needed to isolate a distinguished vertex in a ( random ) cayley tree , when the edges are removed uniformly at random from the current component containing this vertex .",
    "later on , meir and moon @xcite extended their analysis to random recursive trees . the latter form an important family of increasing labeled trees ( see section [ smaintools ] for the definition ) , and",
    "it is the goal of this paper to shed light on issues related to the destruction of such trees .",
    "mahmoud and smythe  @xcite surveyed a multitude of results and applications for random recursive trees .",
    "their recursive structure make them particularly amenable to mathematical analysis , from both a combinatorial and probabilistic point of view .",
    "we focus on the probabilistic side .",
    "our main tools include the fundamental splitting property , a coupling due to iksanov and mhle @xcite and the so - called _ cut - tree _ ( see @xcite ) , which records the key information about the destruction process . the cut - tree allows us to re - prove the results of kuba and panholzer @xcite on the multiple isolation of nodes .",
    "moreover , we gain information on the number of steps needed to disconnect a finite family nodes .",
    "finally , we relate the destruction of a random recursive tree to bernoulli bond percolation on the same tree .",
    "we explain some results concerning the sizes of percolation clusters in the supercritical regime , where the root cluster forms the unique giant cluster .    * figure 1 *",
    "in this section , we present some basic tools in the study of random recursive trees which will be useful to our purposes .",
    "consider a finite and totally ordered set of vertices , say @xmath0 . a tree on @xmath0 is naturally rooted at the smallest element of @xmath0 , and is called increasing if and only if the sequence of vertices along a segment from the root to an arbitrary vertex increases .",
    "most of the time we shall take @xmath1 , which induces of course no loss of generality .",
    "more precisely , it is convenient to introduce the following notion . for an",
    "arbitrary totally ordered set @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath2 , we call the bijective map from @xmath0 to @xmath3 which preserves the order , the canonical relabeling of vertices .",
    "plainly the canonical relabeling transforms an increasing tree on @xmath0 into an increasing tree on @xmath4 .",
    "such relabelings enable us to focus on the structure of the rooted tree without retaining specifically the elements of @xmath0 .",
    "a _ random recursive tree _ ( in short , rrt ) on @xmath5 is a tree picked uniformly at random amongst all the increasing trees on @xmath5 ; it shall be denoted henceforth by @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 has @xmath7 edges and size ( i.e. number of vertices ) @xmath8 .",
    "the terminology stems from the easy observation that a version of @xmath6 can be constructed by the following simple recursive random algorithm in which vertices are incorporated one after the other .",
    "the vertex @xmath9 is naturally connected by an edge to the root @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is connected either to @xmath10 or to @xmath9 with equal probability @xmath12 , and more generally , the parent of the vertex @xmath13 is chosen uniformly at random amongst @xmath14 and independently of the other vertices .",
    "this recursive construction is a close relative to the famous chinese restaurant construction of uniform random permutations ( see , for instance , section 3.1 in pitman @xcite ) , and in particular the number of increasing trees of size @xmath15 equals @xmath16 .",
    "another useful observation is that this recursive construction can be interpreted in terms of the genealogy of a yule process .",
    "recall that a yule process describes the evolution in continuous time of a pure birth process in which each individual gives birth to a child at unit rate and independently of the other individuals .",
    "we label individuals in the increasing order of their birth times , the ancestor receiving by convention the label @xmath10 .",
    "if we let the process evolve until the population reaches size @xmath15 , then its genealogical tree , that is the tree where individuals are viewed as vertices and edges connect children to their parent , is clearly a rrt . here is an application to percolation on @xmath6 which will be useful later on .",
    "[ l2 ] perform a bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath6 with parameter @xmath17 ( i.e. each edge of @xmath6 is deleted with probability @xmath18 , independently of the other edges ) , and let @xmath19 denote the size of the cluster containing the root .",
    "then @xmath20 where @xmath21 a.s . is some random variable .",
    "we view @xmath6 as the genealogical tree of a standard yule process @xmath22 up to time @xmath23 .",
    "it is well - known that the process @xmath24 is a martingale which converges a.s .",
    "to some random variable @xmath25 with the exponential distribution , and it follows that @xmath26    in this setting , performing a bernoulli bond percolation can be interpreted as superposing neutral mutations to the genealogical tree , namely each child is a clone of its parent with probability @xmath27 and a mutant with a new genetic type with probability @xmath18 , independently of the other children .",
    "neutrality means that the rate of birth does not depend on the genetic type . then the process @xmath28 of the number of individuals with the same genetic type as the ancestor is again a yule process , but now with birth rate @xmath27 . as a consequence @xmath29",
    "where @xmath30 denotes another exponentially distributed random variable .",
    "we then observe that @xmath31 which completes the proof .",
    "plainly , the recursive construction can also be interpreted in terms of urns , and we conclude this section by exemplifying this connection . specifically , the size of the root cluster @xmath19 in the above lemma can be identified as the number of red balls in the following plya - hoppe urn . start with one red ball which represents the root of the tree .",
    "a draw is effected as follows : ( i ) choose a ball at random from the urn , observe its color , and put the ball back to the urn .",
    "( ii ) if its color was red , add a red ball to the urn with probability @xmath27 , and add a black ball to the urn with probability @xmath18 .",
    "if its color was black , add another black ball to the urn .",
    "then , after @xmath7 draws , the number of red balls is given by @xmath19 , and in this way , lemma [ l2 ] yields a limit theorem for the proportion of red balls .",
    "the choice @xmath32 in this urn scheme corresponds to the usual plya urn . here ,",
    "if one starts with one red ball and @xmath33 black balls , then the number of red balls after @xmath34 draws is distributed as the size of the subtree @xmath35 of a rrt @xmath6 that stems from the vertex @xmath33 .",
    "it is well - known from the theory of plya urns that this number follows the beta - binomial distribution with parameters @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a beta@xmath39-distributed random variable .",
    "we will use this fact several times below .      the _ splitting property _",
    "( also called randomness preserving property ) reveals the fractal nature of rtt s : roughly speaking , if one removes an edge from a rrt , then the two subtrees resulting from the split are in turn , conditionally on their sizes , independent rrt s .",
    "this is of course of crucial importance when investigating the destruction of a rrt , as we can then apply iteratively the splitting property when removing the edges uniformly at random and one after the other .",
    "we select an edge of @xmath6 uniformly at random and remove it .",
    "then @xmath6 splits into two subtrees , say @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath40 contains the root @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 the pair of increasing trees which then result from the canonical relabelings of the vertices of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "introduce also an integer - valued variable @xmath44 with distribution @xmath45    [ p1 ] ( meir and moon @xcite ) in the notation above , @xmath46 has the same law as @xmath44 conditioned on @xmath47 , that is @xmath48 further , conditionally on @xmath49 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two independent rrt s with respective sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ".    there are @xmath52 configurations @xmath53 given by an increasing tree @xmath54 on @xmath55 and a distinguished edge @xmath56 .",
    "we remove the edge @xmath56 and then relabel vertices canonically in each of the resulting subtrees .",
    "let us enumerate the configurations that yield a given pair @xmath57 of increasing trees on @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the extremity of the edge @xmath56 which is the closest to the root @xmath10 in @xmath54 , and @xmath61 the set of vertices which are disconnected from @xmath33 when @xmath56 is removed . since @xmath54 is increasing , all the vertices in @xmath61 must be larger than @xmath33 , and since we want @xmath62 , there are @xmath63 ways of choosing @xmath61 ( note that this is possible if and only if @xmath64 )",
    ". there are a unique increasing tree structure on @xmath61 and a unique increasing tree structure on @xmath65 that yield respectively @xmath66 and @xmath67 after the canonical relabelings .",
    "conversely , given @xmath67 , @xmath66 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath62 , there is clearly a unique configuration @xmath53 which yields the quadruple @xmath70 .",
    "namely , relabeling vertices in @xmath67 and @xmath71 produces two increasing tree structures @xmath72 and @xmath73 on @xmath65 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "we let @xmath56 denote the edge @xmath74 and then @xmath54 is the increasing tree obtained by connecting @xmath72 and @xmath73 using @xmath56 .",
    "it follows from the analysis above that @xmath75 now recall that @xmath76 to conclude that @xmath77 since there are @xmath78 increasing trees with size @xmath50 and @xmath79 increasing trees with size @xmath51 , this yields the claim .",
    "* it can be easily checked that the splitting property holds more generally when one removes a fixed edge , that is the edge connecting a given vertex @xmath80 to its parent .",
    "of course , the distribution of the sizes of the resulting subtrees then changes ; see the connection to plya urns mentioned in the beginning .",
    "the splitting property was used by meir and moon @xcite to investigate the following random algorithm for isolating the root @xmath10 of a rrt .",
    "starting from @xmath6 , remove a first edge chosen uniformly at random and discard the subtree which does not contain the root @xmath10 .",
    "iterate the procedure with the subtree containing @xmath10 until the root is finally isolated , and denote by @xmath81 the number of steps of this random algorithm .",
    "in other words , @xmath82 is the number of random cuts that are needed to isolate @xmath10 in @xmath6 .",
    "iksanov and mhle @xcite derived from proposition [ p1 ] a useful coupling involving an increasing random walk with step distribution given by .",

    "then define for every @xmath99 @xmath100 and the partial sums @xmath101 .",
    "observe that @xmath102 if and only if @xmath103 , and hence , by construction , there is the identity @xmath104 therefore , follows if we show that @xmath105 are ( unconditionally ) i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath44 .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the splitting property .",
    "specifically , for @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 where we used the notation and the result in proposition [ p1 ] , whereas for @xmath108 we have @xmath109 next , consider the conditional law of @xmath110 given @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "of course , @xmath113 , and this inequality is in fact an equality whenever @xmath114 .",
    "we know from the splitting property that conditionally on its size , say @xmath115 with @xmath116 , @xmath117 is a rrt .",

    "this limit theorem resembles of course theorem [ t1 ] , and the relation between the two is explained by the coupling of the algorithm of isolation of the root and the random walk @xmath86 stated in corollary [ c1 ] , as we shall now see .",
    "let the algorithm for isolating the root run for @xmath133 steps .",

    "we point to the remark after corollary [ c3 ] for more on this . turning back to rrt s , recent generalizations of theorem [ t1 ]",
    "were found first by kuba and panholzer @xcite and then by bertoin @xcite , some of which will be discussed in the reminder of this paper .    in @xcite , kuba and",

    "we point out here that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath146 can also be deduced from theorem [ t1 ] by a probabilistic argument based on the following elementary observation , which enables us to couple the variables @xmath146 for different values of @xmath137 .",
    "specifically , we run the usual algorithm of isolation of the root , except that now , at each time when a subtree becomes disconnected from the root , we keep it aside whenever it contains at least one of the vertices @xmath147 , and discard it forever otherwise .",
    "once the root @xmath10 of @xmath6 has been isolated , we resume with the subtree containing @xmath9 which was set aside , meaning that we run a further algorithm on that subtree until its root @xmath9 has been isolated , keeping aside the further subtrees disconnected from @xmath9 which contain at least one of the vertices @xmath148 .",
    "we then continue with the subtree containing the vertex @xmath11 , and so on until each and every vertex @xmath145 has been isolated .",
    "if we write @xmath149 for the number of steps of this algorithm , then it should be plain that @xmath149 has the same law as @xmath146 , and further @xmath150 .",

    "let @xmath152 denote the subtree containing @xmath13 that arises at this step .",
    "[ l1 ] for each fixed @xmath99 , @xmath153 where @xmath139 is a uniform @xmath140 $ ] random variable .    for the moment , let us take lemma [ l1 ] for granted and deduce the following .",

    "just observe that @xmath155 has the same law as the number of cuts needed to isolate the root @xmath13 of @xmath156 , and recall from an iteration of the splitting property that conditionally on its size , @xmath156 is a rrt .",
    "our statement now follows readily from and lemma [ l1 ] .",
    "writing @xmath157 , we now see from theorem [ t1 ] and corollary [ c2 ] that for each fixed @xmath144 , there is the weak convergence @xmath158 which is theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to the proof of lemma [ l1 ] .",
    "let @xmath159 denote the subtree of @xmath6 that stems from the vertex @xmath13 , and equip each edge @xmath56 of @xmath6 with a uniform @xmath140 $ ] random variable @xmath160 , independently of the other edges .",

    "hence , if we write @xmath164 for @xmath56 the edge connecting @xmath13 to its parent , then @xmath165 .",
    "further , since @xmath139 is independent of the other uniform variables , conditionally on @xmath139 and @xmath159 , @xmath166 can be viewed as the cluster that contains the root vertex @xmath13 after a bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath167 with parameter @xmath168 .",

    "on the other hand , conditionally on its size , and after the usual canonical relabeling of its vertices , @xmath159 is also a rrt ( see the remark at the end of section [ smaintools ] ) .",
    "it then follows from lemma [ l2 ] that @xmath176 which establishes our claim .",
    "imagine now that we remove the edges of @xmath6 one after the other and in a uniform random order , no matter whether they belong to the root component or not .",
    "we call this the _ destruction process _ of @xmath6 .",
    "after @xmath7 steps , no edges are present anymore and all the vertices have been isolated .",
    "in particular , the random variable which counts only the number of edge removals from the root component can be identified with @xmath82 from the previous section .",
    "the purpose of this section is to introduce and study the asymptotic behavior of two trees which can be naturally associated to this destruction process , namely the tree of component sizes and the cut - tree .",
    "furthermore , we give some applications of the cut - tree to the isolation and disconnection of nodes and comment on ordered destruction of a rrt .      in this part , we are interested in the sizes of the tree components produced by the destruction process .",

    "the component sizes are naturally stored in a tree structure .",
    "as our index set , we use the universal tree @xmath177 with the convention @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "we will directly identify a vertex @xmath183 with its label @xmath192 .",
    "following the steps of the destruction process , we build this process dynamically starting from the singleton @xmath193 and ending after @xmath7 steps with the full process @xmath194 more precisely , when the first edge of @xmath6 is removed in the destruction process , @xmath6 splits into two subtrees , say @xmath195 and @xmath196 , where @xmath195 contains the root @xmath10 . we stress that @xmath195 is naturally rooted at @xmath10 and @xmath196 at its smallest vertex . the size @xmath197 is viewed as the first child of @xmath198 and denoted by @xmath199 .",

    "more specifically , the algorithm for isolating the root can be interpreted as a dynamical percolation process in which components that do not contain the root are instantaneously frozen .",
    "imagine a continuous - time version of the algorithm , where each edge of @xmath6 is equipped with an independent exponential clock of some parameter @xmath370 .",
    "when a clock rings , the corresponding edge is removed if and only if it currently belongs to the root component . at time @xmath371 , the root component can naturally be viewed as the root cluster of a bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath6 with parameter @xmath372 . moreover , under this coupling each percolation cluster is contained in some tree component which was generated by the isolation process up to time @xmath373 . in order to discover the percolation clusters inside a non - root tree component @xmath374",
    ", the latter has to be unfrozen , i.e. additional edges from @xmath374 have to be removed .",
    "in particular , the percolation cluster containing the root of @xmath374 can again be identified as the root component of an isolation process on @xmath374 , stopped at an appropriate time .",
    "these observations lead in @xcite to the study of the asymptotic sizes of the largest and next largest percolation clusters of @xmath6 , when the percolation parameter @xmath375 satisfies @xmath376 this regime corresponds precisely to the supercritical regime , in the sense that the root cluster is the unique giant cluster , and its complement in @xmath6 has a size of order @xmath7 , too .",
    "indeed , the height @xmath377 of a vertex @xmath183 picked uniformly at random in a rrt of size @xmath15 satisfies @xmath378 .",
    "since the probability that @xmath183 is connected to the root is given by the first moment of @xmath379 , where @xmath380 denotes the size of the root cluster , one obtains @xmath381 a similar argument shows @xmath382 , which proves @xmath383 in @xmath384 .    let us now consider the next largest clusters in the regime .",
    "we write @xmath385 for the sizes of the non - root percolation clusters of @xmath6 , ranked in the decreasing order .",
    "we quote from @xcite the following limit result .",
    "[ p4 ] for every fixed integer @xmath386 , @xmath387 converges in distribution as @xmath236 towards @xmath388 where @xmath389 denotes the sequence of the atoms of a poisson random measure on @xmath229 with intensity @xmath390 .",
    "the intensity is better understood as the image of the intensity measure @xmath391 on @xmath392 by the map @xmath393 .",
    "in fact , from our introductory remarks and proposition [ pbranching ] it should be clear that the first coordinate of an atom @xmath394 stands for the asymptotic ( and normalized ) size of the tree component containing the percolation cluster , while the second encodes the time when the component was separated from the root .    instead of providing more details here ,",
    "let us illustrate an alternative route to prove the proposition , which was taken in  @xcite to generalize the results to _ scale - free random trees_. these random graphs form a family of increasing trees indexed by a parameter @xmath395 that grow according to a preferential attachment algorithm , see @xcite .",
    "in the boundary case @xmath396 , one obtains a rrt , while in the case @xmath397 , the @xmath13th vertex is added to one of the first @xmath398 vertices with probability proportional to its current degree . in @xcite , the connection of scale - free random trees to the genealogy of yule processes was employed , and it should not come as a surprise that this approach can be adapted to random recursive trees .",
    "in fact , the case of rrt s is considerably simpler , since one has not to keep track of the degree of vertices when edges are deleted .",
    "let us sketch the main changes .",
    "denote by @xmath399 the genealogical tree of a standard yule process @xmath400 at time @xmath163 .",
    "similar to section @xmath254 of  @xcite , we superpose bernoulli bond percolation with parameter @xmath401 to this construction .",
    "namely , if a new vertex is attached to the genealogical tree , we delete the edge connecting this vertex to its parent with probability @xmath18 .",
    "we write @xmath402 for the resulting combinatorial structure at time @xmath163 , and @xmath403 for the sequence of the subtrees at time @xmath163 , enumerated in the increasing order of their birth times , where we use the convention that @xmath404 if less than @xmath51 edges have been deleted up to time @xmath163 . in particular , @xmath405 is the subtree containing the root @xmath10 , and @xmath406 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath407 denotes the birth time of the @xmath13th subtree , then the process @xmath408 is a yule process with birth rate @xmath27 per unit population size , started from a single particle of size @xmath9 . by analyzing the birth times as in @xcite ,",
    "one readily obtains the analogous statements of section @xmath11 and @xmath254 there .",
    "this leads to another proof of proposition [ p4 ] .",
    "* remark . * as it is shown in the forthcoming paper  @xcite , the approach via yule processes can be extended further to all percolation regimes @xmath409 . moreover ,",
    "if the entire family of cluster sizes is encoded by a tree structure similar to the tree of component sizes , one can specify the finite - dimensional limit of this `` tree of cluster sizes '' .",
    "details will be given in  @xcite .",
    "we finally take a closer look at the size of the root cluster @xmath380 for supercritical percolation with parameter @xmath410 as we have already discussed , @xmath380 satisfies a law of large numbers , but as we will point out here , @xmath380 exhibits non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this should be seen in sharp contrast to other graph models , were asymptotic normality of the giant cluster has been established , e.g. for the complete graph on @xmath7 vertices and percolation parameter @xmath411 , @xmath412 fixed ( stephanov @xcite , pittel @xcite , barraez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    for rrt s",
    ", the fluctuations can be obtained from a recent result of schweinsberg @xcite . among other things",
    ", he studied how the number of blocks in the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent changes over time .",
    "the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent was introduced in @xcite in the context of spin glasses , and goldschmidt and martin @xcite discovered the following connection to the random cutting of rrt s : equip each edge of a rrt of size @xmath7 on the vertex set @xmath413 with an independent standard exponential clock . if a clock rings , delete the corresponding edge , say @xmath56 , and the whole subtree rooted at the endpoint of @xmath56 most distant from the root @xmath9 . furthermore , replace the label of the vertex of @xmath56 which is closer to the root @xmath9 , say @xmath13 , by the label set consisting of @xmath13 and all the vertex labels of the removed subtree .",
    "then the sets of labels form a partition of @xmath413 , which evolves according to the dynamics of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent started from @xmath7 blocks @xmath414 ( see proposition 2.2 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that in this framework , the variable @xmath82 counting the number of steps in the algorithm for isolating the root can be interpreted as the number of collision events which take place until there is just one block left .",
    "this statement was re - proved in @xcite , with a different approach which does not rely on the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "instead , three different growth phases of a rrt @xmath6 are considered , and the effect of percolation is studied in each of these phases .",
    "this approach makes again use of the coupling of iksanov and mhle and the connection to yule processes , providing an intuitive explanation for the correction terms in the statement .                                                    in : m. drmota , p. flajolet , d. gardy , and b. gittenberger ( eds ) . _",
