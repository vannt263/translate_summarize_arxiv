    "the time scale for this evolution is strongly dependent on the stellar mass @xcite ; in particular , for low mass stars ( k5 or later ) , @xmath090% of the stars have lost their primordial disk at about 5 - 7 myr @xcite , while for objects in the mass range of the herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars ( @xmath2 ) , the time scale for primordial disk dissipation is less than @xmath03 myr @xcite .",
    "theories of dust evolution in the solar nebula indicate that the timescale for disk evolution is also proportional to the orbital period @xcite ; so , grain growth and settling to the mid - plane occur fastest in the inner disk resulting in a faster decline of disk emission at shorter wavelength @xcite . in this  clearing phase  , stars could evolve to  transition disk objects  in which we find an inner optically thin region with an outer optically thick primordial disk @xcite .",

    "the outer kb model predicts that icy objects ( @xmath01000 - 3000 km ) begin to form at the inner edge of the model at @xmath010 - 20 myr .",

    "<S> comparing our samples with 24 observations of intermediate mass stars in other stellar groups , spanning a range of ages from 2.5 myr to 150 myr , we find that debris disks are more frequent and have larger 24 excess at 10 myr ( ob1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this trend agrees with predictions of models of evolution of solids in the outer regions of disks ( @xmath130 au ) , where large icy objects ( @xmath01000 km ) begin to form at @xmath010 myr ; the presence of these objects in the disk initiates a collisional cascade , producing enough dust particles to explain the relatively large 24 excess observed in ob1a . </S>",
    "<S> the dust luminosity observed in the stellar groups older than 10 myr declines roughly as predicted by collisional cascade models . combining spitzer observations , optical spectra and 2mass data </S>",
