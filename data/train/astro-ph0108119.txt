    "atomic diffusion , whereby heavier elements settle relative to hydrogen in a star is a physical process which occurs in stars .",
    "helioseismology provides clear evidence that diffusion is occurring in the sun ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a result , a large number of studies have been made of the effect of diffusion on the evolution of the sun and other stars .",
    "models and isochrones appropriate for globular cluster stars have shown that the inclusion of diffusion reduces the main sequence life time of the stars and reduces their effective temperatures . the absolute age inferred for the oldest globular clusters",
    "is reduced by @xmath6 when diffusion is included in the stellar models @xcite .",
    "diffusion leads to changes in the surface abundances of elements .",
    "in particular , the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen will decrease over time .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the depletion of an element out of the surface of a star is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total mass of the star , @xmath9 is the mass of the surface convection zone , @xmath10 is the temperature at the base of the convection zone and @xmath11 is a constant , which can vary for different elements .",
    "since @xmath9 can be a strong function of the total mass of the star , the diffusion models predict that the surface abundances vary for stars of different masses .",
    "observations of li in metal - poor stars have shown the existence of a plateau , where the abundance is constant over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations suggest that diffusion is inhibited near the surface of metal - poor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the li abundance observations can be reproduced by models which include fully efficient diffusion .",
    "this follows from their analysis which includes the effects of observational errors , uncertainties in the li abundance determinations and in the effective temperature scale , and the size of the observed samples of stars .",
    "li is one of three elements produced during the big bang , and so its primordial abundance is of considerable importance in constraining big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xcite found that , due to diffusion , their predicted primordial li abundance was a factor of two higher than that observed in the metal - poor plateau stars .",
    "the inclusion of diffusion in stellar models has important consequences for the estimated age of the oldest globular clusters and the inferred primordial li abundance .",
    "thus , it is important to determine if diffusion is actually occurring in metal - poor stars .",
    "the recent observations of iron abundances in turn - off and giant branch stars in the metal - poor globular cluster ngc 6397 by @xcite provide an excellent test for the occurrence of diffusion in metal - poor stars .",
    "@xcite found that the turn - off and giant branch stars had identical iron abundances ( within a few percent ) .",
    "stars near the turn - off can have convective masses which are orders of magnitude smaller than those on the giant branch .",
    "thus , one would have expect that if diffusion does occur near the surface of metal - poor stars , it would lead to a marked difference in the surface abundance of iron between the main sequence turn - off stars , and those in the giant branch .",
    "these effects should be particularly noticeable in ngc 6397 because it is a relatively metal - poor cluster with @xmath0$}}= -2.02\\pm 0.04 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the convective envelope masses on the main sequence become smaller as one goes to more metal - poor stars ; as a result , the diffusion time scale ( equation [ eqtau ] ) is shorter for metal - poor stars .",
    "the use of iron abundances in globular clusters to study diffusion has several advantages over using li observations in field halo stars .",
    "first , all the stars in ngc 6397 were born with the same initial composition and at the same time .",
    "li abundances are usually determined for field halo stars which have different compositions , and may have different ages .",
    "second , the interpretation of the li observations is complicated by the fact that li is destroyed at temperatures @xmath12k , implying that mixing or turbulence within a star can lead to a change in the surface abundance of li . in contrast , mixing or turbulence can only change the surface abundance of iron if diffusion is already operating ; otherwise the abundance of iron is the same everywhere in the star and mixing can not change the surface abundance of iron .",
    "finally , iron abundance measurements are typically determined from a large number of lines , minimizing the observational errors .",
    "li abundances are determined from a single line , and the li abundance measurements are quite sensitive to the adopted effective temperature scale .",
    "section [ secmodel ] of this paper discusses the stellar models and isochrones used in this study .",
    "this includes fits of the isochrones to the observed color magnitude digram of ngc 6397 .",
    "the effects of metal diffusion on the surface abundance of iron are presented in ",

    "[ secsumm ] contains a summary of the principal results in this paper .",
    "the stellar evolution models were calculated using chaboyer s stellar evolution code . the basic input physics used in the code",

    "these calculations use the @xcite diffusion coefficients for helium and heavy elements .",
    "the variation of the abundances of h , he and fe are followed , all other heavy elements are assumed to diffuse at the same speed as fully - ionized iron .",
    "the differences in the diffusion velocities among the heavy elements are small for the low mass stars ( @xmath13 ) considered here @xcite , and our procedure does not introduce any significant error into the calculations .",
    "the local changes in the metal abundance are taken into account in the opacity computation by interpolating among tables with different heavy element mass fractions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "note that the @xcite diffusion coefficients do not include the effects of radiative acceleration .",
    "studies of the effects of radiative acceleration on solar metallicity f - stars have been performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that radiative acceleration is predicted to be important for solar metallicity stars with masses greater than approximately @xmath15 .",
    "the importance of radiative acceleration depends on the opacity ( which is a function of temperature and density ) and the radiative flux . in general the physical conditions near the base of the surface convection zone in a @xmath16 metal - poor star",

    "@xcite showed that most of the evolutionary properties of metal poor stars with enhanced @xmath29-capture elements could be reproduced by models with scaled solar compositions if the total heavy element mass fraction @xmath14 was identical in the two sets of models . by calculating models over a relatively large range in we can explore what effect possible mis - matches between the observed abundances and those used in our models have on predictions .",
    "the helium abundance in the models was determined assuming a primordial helium abundance of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the primordial helium abundance was chosen to be in agreement with @xcite who base their determinations upon big bang nucleosynthesis and deuterium abundance measurements in quasars .",

    "the mass spacing ranged from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . in total , over 4000 stellar evolution runs were calculated .",
    "the age range of 11  15 gyr was chosen , as it encompasses the most recent estimate for the absolute age of old , metal - poor globular clusters , @xmath39gyr @xcite .",
    "as a test of the models , isochrones were calculated using the stellar models which included the effects of diffusion and fit to the ngc 6397 color - magnitude observations of @xcite .",

    "the main sequence can have the same effective temperatures , it is easiest to illustrate the effects of heavy element diffusion on the surface iron abundance when the surface  value is plotted as a function of @xmath48 ( figure [ logg ] ) .",

    "however , @xcite have pointed out that the when one takes into account the observational errors , uncertainties in the li abundance determinations and in the effective temperature scale , and the size of the observed samples of stars , the li abundance observations can be reproduced by models which include fully efficient diffusion .",
    "in contrast , observations of iron abundances in turn - off and giant branch stars in the metal - poor globular cluster ngc 6397 clearly show that heavy element diffusion does not occur near the surface of metal - poor stars .",
    "a key difference between the li observations analyzed by @xcite and the fe observations analyzed here is that the li observations are primarily obtained for field stars , while the fe abundances which have been analyzed in this paper have been obtained for a single globular cluster .",

    "iron is not subject to depletion on the red giant branch making it easy to compare the observed iron abundances between the main sequence turn - off and giant branch in a given cluster .",
    "the deepening of the convection zone on the red giant branch leads to significant li depletion in these stars .",
    "the globular cluster li abundance data analyzed by @xcite involved a comparison between giant branch stars and main sequence turn - off stars .",

    "helioseismology clearly shows that diffusion does occur in the sun @xcite .",
    "the mass of the convection zone in the sun is @xmath83 . as diffusion",
    "is not inhibited in the sun , this suggests that the mechanism which inhibits diffusion only acts in the very outermost layers of a star ( ie : for @xmath84 ) .",
    "combined with the estimate for the minimum mass of the mixed zone given above , it appears that the mass of the mixed zone at the surface of hot metal - poor stars is in the range @xmath85 .    to determine what effects inhibiting diffusion in the outer layers of a star has on the observed properties of the models , the diffusion subroutine in our code",
    "was altered so that diffusion was shut off in the outer layers of the star .",
    "this was accomplished by setting the diffusion coefficients to zero when @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the total mass of the star .",

    "we see that when diffusion is inhibited in the outer layers of the model , the predicted temperatures of the models are similar to models evolved without diffusion .",
    "the primary reason diffusion models are cooler than non - diffusion models is that diffusion of helium out of the envelope increases the envelope opacity , which increases the model radius and hence , decreases the effective temperature .",
    "thus , when diffusion is inhibited in the outer layers , the effective temperature of the models resembles the non - diffusion models .",
    "the model in which diffusion was inhibited at the surface had a similar lifetime to the full diffusion model .",
    "this is because diffusion was not inhibited in the deep interior of the model .",

    ". such tracks by themselves , however , may provide a misleading guide to the impact of diffusion on cluster age estimates . to determine globular cluster ages",
    "one compares isochrones to observations .",
    "diffusion will change the shape of the isochrones in a different way than it changes the shape of individual tracks because models with different masses experience different degrees of diffusion .",
    "to explore the consequences this modification of diffusion has on age determinations , isochrones were calculated based upon the no diffusion models , and models in which diffusion was inhibited in the outer layers .",
    "these isochrones are compared to the full diffusion isochrones in figure [ isod_nod ] .",
    "the isochrone in which diffusion has been inhibited falls half - way between the isochrone with full diffusion , and the isochrone with no diffusion .",
    "if  is used as an age indicator , then ages determined using isochrones in which diffusion has been inhibited will be 4% larger ages derived from the full diffusion isochrones , and 4% smaller than ages derived using the no diffusion isochrones .",
    "if diffusion is inhibited near the surface of metal - poor stars ( likely by rotation induced mixing ) , one naturally wonders if diffusion occurs in the deep interior of metal - poor stars .",
    "perhaps the rotation induced mixing suppress the diffusion throughout the entire star . at the present time",
    ", there is no clear answer as to whether or not diffusion is occurring in the deep interior of metal - poor stars .",
    "a definitive answer will likely have to await observations from stellar seismology , which will probe the interior structure of metal - poor stars and allow one to test the interior properties of theoretical models .",
    "this study has shown that diffusion is inhibited in the surface layers of metal - poor stars .",
    "stellar models and isochrones which include the full effects of diffusion are in error , and should not be used for comparing to observational data .",
    "our calculations in which diffusion is inhibited near the surface of the star are admittingly ad - hoc .",
    "however , as helioseismology has shown that diffusion is occurring in the interior of the sun , we believe it is likely that diffusion is also occurring in the interiors of metal - poor stars . the obvious difference between the sun and the metal - poor turn - off stars ,",
    "is that the surface convection zone is much larger in the sun .",
    "theoretical calculations of rotation induced mixing have shown that this mixing is most effective in the outer layers of a star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that diffusion is occurring in the interior of the sun makes us believe that diffusion is only being inhibited in the outermost layers of stars .",
    "for this reason , we prefer the use of stellar models and isochrones in which diffusion operates in the interior of the model ( but not in the outer layers ) to models which do not include diffusion .",
    "given that diffusion is occurring in the sun , stellar models and isochrones which include diffusion are appropriate for solar - type stars .",
    "the model we have presented for inhibiting diffusion in the surface layers of stars allows one to use a set of isochrones calculated using the same assumptions for both metal - poor and solar - type stars .",
    "a large number of stellar evolution models which include the effects of helium and heavy element diffusion were constructed .",
    "the amount of diffusion of iron out of the surface convection zone is a strong function of the mass and age of a star . as a result",
    ", the models predicted that the  abundance measured in the turn - off stars in the globular cluster ngc 6397 should be more than 0.28 dex lower than the  measured in the giant branch stars .",
    "in contrast , observations by @xcite demonstrate that the turn - off and giant branch stars have identical values of indicating that uninhibited metal diffusion does not occur in the surface layers of metal - poor stars . based upon this observed fact and the physical principals underlying diffusion processes , we estimate that the minimum mass of the region where diffusion is inhibited near the surface of metal - poor stars to be @xmath91 . models and isochrones in which diffusion was inhibited in the outer layers were calculated and compared to full diffusion isochrones , and isochrones without diffusion .",
    "the isochrones in which diffusion has been inhibited have properties which lie half - way between the full diffusion isochrones , and the no diffusion isochrones . as a consequence ,",
    "globular cluster age estimates which use   as their age indicator , and which are based upon models which include the full effects of diffusion need to be revised upward by 4% .",
    "helioseismic observations clearly show that diffusion is occurring in the sun , which suggests that diffusion operates in most regions of a star .",

    "<S> stellar evolution models which include the effect of helium and heavy element diffusion have been calculated for initial iron abundances of @xmath0$}}= -2.3,\\ , -2.1,\\ , -1.9 $ ] and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these models were calculated for a large variety of masses and three separate mixing lengths , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 being the solar calibrated mixing length ) . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the surface iron abundance for stars of different masses was determined for the ages 11 , 13 and 15 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> iron settles out of the surface convection zone on the main sequence ; this iron is dredged back up when the convection zone deepens on the giant branch . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the surface abundance in the turn - off stars was at least @xmath5dex lower than the surface  abundance in giant - branch stars of the same age . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent high dispersion spectra of stars in the globular cluster ngc 6397 found that the turn - off and giant branch stars had identical ( within a few percent ) iron abundances of @xmath0$}}=-2.03 $ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations prove that heavy element diffusion must be inhibited in the surface layers of metal - poor stars . when diffusion is inhibited in the outer layers of a stellar model , the predicted temperatures of the models are similar to models evolved without diffusion , while the predicted lifetimes are similar to stars in which diffusion is not inhibited . </S>",
    "<S> isochrones constructed from the models in which diffusion is inhibited fall half - way between isochrones without diffusion , and isochrones with full diffusion . as a result , absolute globular cluster ages which are based upon the absolute magnitude of the turn - off are 4% larger than ages inferred from full diffusion isochrones , and 4% smaller than ages inferred from no diffusion isochrones . </S>"
