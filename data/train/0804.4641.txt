    "quantum superposition and entanglement are the cornerstones lying at the foundations of quantum information and the principal support of the new quantum technologies which are at different stages of conception and development at present .",
    "putting entanglement to work , enabling its use as a resource , is the key to the success of these technologies .",
    "therefore , a complete understanding of entanglement , necessary at the fundamental level , is also important for these developments to occur .",
    "entanglement can be envisaged in very different forms ; it originally appeared in quantum mechanics  @xcite as a direct connection between distant particles , a residue of past direct interaction between them @xcite . in quantum field theory entanglement",
    "can be traced back to the non - locality of the vacuum state  @xcite or , simply , to field propagation .",
    "similar arguments operate for a lattice of coupled oscillators  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze some features of entanglement generation closely related to the microscopic causality of quantum field theory . put in simple words , this",
    "work attempts to ascertain whether a pair of spatially separated parties ( say , a pair of neutral two level atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) can get entangled in a finite time while they remain causally disconnected @xcite .",
    "each party interacts locally with the electromagnetic field , the carrier of the interaction .",
    "we stress here that , as shown in @xcite , perturbation theory produces nonsignalling @xcite results for this system and that the apparent causality violations come from the nonlocal specification of some final states . at first sight , the question can be answered in the negative ; if the parties remain causally separated from each other , they can not entangle .",
    "however , the propagator @xmath8 is finite even when @xmath9 , and perhaps some correlations could be exchanged between both parties  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the correlations could be blamed on the preexisting entanglement between different parts of the vacuum  @xcite , which could be transferred to the atoms .",
    "whatever the point of view , correlations are exchanged through ( time ordered ) products , while only commutators are restricted to be causal @xcite .",
    "our analysis can not sidestep that the role of the field goes beyond that of a mere carrier , quanta could be absorbed from the field or escape in the form of photons @xcite .",
    "how does the entanglement between @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the state of the field ?",
    "this question shapes our discussion below",
    ".    we will include in the final state all the perturbatively accessible field states , analyzing for each of them the correlations in the reduced atomic state .",
    "we compute the entanglement measures for different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , that lie inside the atoms mutual light cone and beyond .",
    "the atomic state that results after tracing over the states of the field is separable , which means , in the scheme of @xcite , that there is no transference of vacuum entanglement , only classical correlations . in @xcite ,",
    "these correlations become entanglement when a suitable time dependent coupling with the scalar field is introduced . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", this would require an unrealistic control of the atom - field interaction in the electromagnetic case that we are dealing with here .",
    "as an alternative way to achieve entanglement between the atoms we consider a postselection process of the field states with @xmath12 photons .",
    "this is a nonlocal operation and therefore entanglement generation is allowed . in @xcite ,",
    "only the vacuum case when @xmath13 was analyzed , and no entanglement measures were considered .",
    "we get quantum correlations for all the different field states .",
    "we also get useful hints on the nature of the correlations , whether they come from photon exchange , source indistinguishability , etc .",
    "we will consider the field initially in the vacuum state , including the cases with 0 , 1 and 2 final photons to analyze perturbatively the amplitudes and density matrices to order @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the wavelengths relevant in the interaction with the atoms , and the separation between them , are much longer than the atomic dimensions .",
    "the dipole approximation , appropriate to these conditions , permits the splitting of the system hamiltonian into two parts @xmath15 that are separately gauge invariant .",
    "the first part is the hamiltonian in the absence of interactions other than the potentials that keep @xmath6 and @xmath7 stable , @xmath16 .",
    "the second contains all the interaction of the atoms with the field @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electric displacement field , and @xmath19 is the electric dipole moment of atom @xmath20 , that we will take as real and of equal magnitude for both atoms @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the excited and ground states of the atoms , respectively .    in what follows",
    "we choose a system given initially by the product state , latexmath:[$|\\,\\psi\\,\\rangle_0\\,=\\ ,    the excited state @xmath22 , atom @xmath7 in the ground state @xmath23 , and the field in the vacuum state @xmath25 .",
    "the system then evolves under the effect of the interaction during a lapse of time @xmath1 into a state : @xmath26|\\,\\psi\\,\\rangle_0 , \\label{b}\\ ] ] ( @xmath27 being the time ordering operator ) that , to order @xmath14 , can be given in the interaction picture as @xmath28 where @xmath29 being @xmath30 , @xmath27 being the time ordering operator and @xmath31 is a shorthand for the state of @xmath20 photons with definite momenta and polarizations , i.e. @xmath32 , etc .",
    "the sign of the superscript is associated to the energy difference between the initial and final atomic states of each emission . among all the terms that contribute to the final state ( [ c ] )",
    "only @xmath33 corresponds to interaction between both atoms , which is real interaction only if @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being the interatomic distance ) .",
    "this would change at higher order in @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath36 describes intra - atomic radiative corrections , @xmath37 and @xmath38 single photon emission by one atom , and @xmath39 by both atoms , while @xmath40 corresponds to two photon emission by a single atom .",
    "details on the computations of these quantities would be given in appendix a. in quantum optics , virtual terms like @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 , which do not conserve energy and appear only at very short times , are usually neglected by the introduction of a rotating wave approximation .",
    "but here we are interested in the short time behavior , and therefore all the terms must be included , as in @xcite . actually ,",
    "only when all these virtual effects are considered , it can be said properly that the probability of excitation of atom @xmath7 is completely independent of atom @xmath6 when @xmath41 @xcite ( @xmath35 being the distance between the atoms ) .    finally , in the dipole approximation the actions @xmath42 in ( [ d ] ) reduce to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the transition frequency , and we are neglecting atomic recoil .",

    "this is well within the small neighborhood of @xmath69 mentioned above .",
    "radiative corrections would shift the maximum to @xmath83 , so the entropy is sensitive to the lamb shift when this contributes to the dipole radiative corrections .",
    "we now come to the case @xmath84 , where the atoms excite one photon from the vacuum , jumping to the state @xmath85 , ( with @xmath86 ) , during the time interval @xmath1 .",
    "the density matrix for this case contains the term @xmath87 , which we will call @xmath88 in the following , producing a concurrence @xmath89 so , even if this case only describes independent local phenomena attached to the emission of one photon by either atom @xmath6 or @xmath7 , the concurrence comes from the tangling between the amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 which have different loci .",
    "the state of the photon emitted by @xmath6 and the state of @xmath6 are correlated in the same way as the state of the photon emitted by @xmath7 with the state of @xmath7 are .",
    "these independent field - atom correlations are transferred to atom - atom correlations when we trace out a photon line with different ends , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , when computing @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , while @xmath91 and @xmath92 are independent of the distance @xmath35 between the atoms , @xmath93 where    @xmath94    which depends explicitly on @xmath35 .",

    "the peak at @xmath69 comes from the term with phase @xmath102 that can be singled out from the linear combination of phasors in the integrand of ( [ l ] ) .    ) as a function of @xmath99 for three values of @xmath103 ( solid line ) , 10 ( dashed line ) and 15 ( dotted line ) .",

    "it might be @xmath6 or @xmath7 , with the values of @xmath88 and @xmath98 depending on their indistinguishability .",
    "eventually , conservation of energy will forbid the process @xmath106 for large interaction times .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 , @xmath88 and @xmath98 will vanish as @xmath1 grows to infinity ( @xmath105 for each value of @xmath107 in fig .",
    "2 ) , as can be deduced from the vanishing of @xmath108 for @xmath97 .",
    "the entropy of entanglement gives an alternative description of the situation .",
    "its computation requires tracing over one of the parts @xmath6 or @xmath7 , so no information is left in @xmath109 about @xmath35 , but it still gives information about the relative contribution of both participating states @xmath110 and @xmath111 to the final state . in terms of @xmath112 would not be for the difference between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath38 should be equal to @xmath37 , @xmath115 , and @xmath109 would attain its maximum value . not only this is not the case but , as said above , @xmath38 will vanish with time and only @xmath111 will be in the final asymptotic state .",
    "notice the result , indistinguishability was swept away because for large @xmath1 we know which atom ( @xmath6 ) emitted the photon . therefore , the entropy will eventually vanish for large interaction times .",
    "there are two cases with @xmath116 ; one ( with amplitude @xmath40 ) when both photons are emitted by the same atom , the other ( with amplitude @xmath39 ) when each atom emits a single photon .",
    "the final atomic state @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , is in the same subspace as for @xmath119 .",
    "the normalization @xmath120 is @xmath121 like the expectation values @xmath40 , @xmath39 , so that all the coefficients in @xmath122 may be large .",

    "the entropy @xmath125 is now given in terms of a parameter @xmath126 .",
    "notice that @xmath127 .",
    "hence , both @xmath128 and @xmath125 , depend on @xmath35 .",
    "this is different from the single photon case , where the only @xmath35 dependence was in the coherences of @xmath129 , which did not feed into @xmath130 .",
    "the correlations came in that case from the indistinguishability of the photon source .",
    "the case @xmath131 resembles that of the entanglement swapping paradigm @xcite , where there are two independent pairs of down converted photons .",
    "here we have two independent atom - photon pairs .",
    "the swapping would arise in both cases from detecting one photon of each pair .",
    "but with the initial state we are considering here , both @xmath40 and @xmath39 eventually vanish .",
    "more interesting would be the case with the initial atomic state @xmath132 , that we will analyze elsewhere .",
    "we have seen that if the state of the field is defined , the atomic state is entangled inside and outside the light cone . but what happens if the field state is ignored , that is , if we trace over the field degrees of freedom ?",
    "then the atomic state is represented by the following density matrix ( in the basis @xmath133 ) : @xmath134 where @xmath135 was used again , and @xmath136 .",
    "it can be shown that the concurrence associated to this density always vanishes except for a bounded range of small values of @xmath68 .     as a function of @xmath137 for @xmath103 ( solid line ) , 10 ( dashed line ) , 15 ( dotted line ) .",

    "but the atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 are mutually dependent even for zero concurrence .",
    "their mutual information @xmath139 , which measures the total correlations between both parties , is completely classical in this case , but may be finite .",
    "we show this quantity in fig . 4 for different values of @xmath107 with an inset with the concurrence for small values of @xmath68 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the correlations between a pair of neutral two - level atoms that are allowed to interact with the electromagnetic field , initially in the vacuum state .",
    "we have computed the concurrences that arise when the final state contains @xmath140 or 2 photons .",
    "they may be sizeable for @xmath68 small ( @xmath104 for a given @xmath35 ) and also around @xmath69 . only in the case @xmath62",
    "there are interactions between both atoms , generating an entanglement that persists asymptotically .",
    "we have carefully taken into account all the terms contributing to the amplitude for finite time ( they are @xmath141 , not @xmath142 as is sometimes assumed ) .",
    "a small amount of entanglement can be generated between spacelike separated parties due to the finiteness of @xmath33 when @xmath74 , but a change of behavior appears for @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath116 the final atoms are in the same subspace than for @xmath62 .",
    "there are similar correlations that in this case can give rise to entanglement swapping , by measuring both photons in a definite state for instance .",
    "naturally , in this case entanglement may be sizeable for spacelike separated parties , as here this is not related to any kind of propagation .",
    "entanglement in the case with only a final photon ( @xmath84 ) comes from the indistinguishability of the photon source .",
    "it will vanish asymptotically when , by energy conservation , only one atom ( @xmath6 in the present case ) may emit the photon , and it is also sizeable when @xmath74 .",
    "it is interesting how these correlations become classical ( except for small @xmath68 ) when the states of the field are traced over .",
    "we have shown through the mutual information the residues of what were quantum correlations in the individual cases analyzed before .",

    "c.s . acknowledges support from csic i3 program .      in this appendix , we will give details on the computations of the quantities of interest in the main text .",
    "we first start with @xmath36 and @xmath33 in ( [ d ] ) .",
    "both are a sum of second order transition amplitudes , which can be written as : @xmath143 being @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 the energies of the final @xmath147 , intermediate @xmath148 and initial @xmath149 states of the system , respectively .",
    "the sum over @xmath150 is a sum over all the possible intermediate states of the system which in the case of fixed two - level atoms reduces to a sum over all the momenta and polarizations of the emitted photon .",
    "the time integrations in ( [ o ] ) are just @xmath151 the second term in ( [ p ] ) is usually neglected , but give rise to a very different short time behavior @xcite ( @xmath141 , not @xmath142 ) . therefore , it is of interest for our purposes .    in order to obtain @xmath33 we have to sum over the amplitudes for single photon emission at atom @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) followed by absorption at atom @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the case where a photon is emitted and absorbed by the same atom corresponds to @xmath36 , that we will consider below . using the mode expansion for the electric field : @xmath152 ( with @xmath153=\\delta^3(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k'})\\,\\delta_{\\lambda\\,\\lambda'}$ ] ) taking into account ( [ o ] ) and ( [ p ] ) , recalling that @xmath154 , and using the tabulated integrals that we list at the end of the appendix , a somewhat tedious although straightforward computation leads to : @xmath155 @xmath14 being the fine structure constant and @xmath156 , which , in terms of @xmath157 and @xmath137 are @xmath158+\\nonumber\\\\e^{-i\\,z}&[ei(iz)-ei(iz(1\\pm1/x))]\\ } \\label{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath74 , @xmath159 having the extra term @xmath160 for @xmath73 .",
    "we use the conventions of @xcite . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "the non - zero contributions for @xmath74 come from the second term of ( [ p ] ) .",
    "we display here the results of the derivatives in ( [ r ] ) only for the particular case where the dipoles are parallel along the @xmath107 axis ( @xmath161 ) and the atoms are along the @xmath68 axis , corresponding to the physical situation considered previously in , for instance , @xcite and in this paper .",
    "actually , @xmath22 is a triply degenerate state @xmath162 with @xmath163 and our scheme holds for a transition with @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "another independent possibility would be to consider transitions with @xmath165 that corresponds to @xmath166 @xcite .",

    "please notice that , for @xmath69 , @xmath169 , and therefore @xmath170 , but then , recalling @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "now we come to @xmath36 , which is the sum of the radiative corrections of atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as can be seen in the main text , @xmath36 appears in our results only as a higher order correction to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , instead of finding an exact expression for it , we are mainly concerned with removing the divergencies .",
    "we followed the standard treatment ( see , for instance , @xcite ) which is valid for the times @xmath173 we are considering . from ( [ o ] ) , it is possible to arrive at : @xmath174 now , using in ( [ u ] ) the identities @xmath175 the first term of ( [ v ] ) cancels out the contribution of the hamiltonian self - interaction terms @xcite , the second is the state - independent contribution that can be absorbed in the definition of the zero of energy @xcite , the third cancels the counterterm coming from the mass renormalization @xcite and finally the last term has logarithmic divergences and a cut - off , related with the fact that we are in the electric dipole representation could be imposed at @xmath176 .",

    "@xmath182 and @xmath183 are just the two terms that contribute to @xmath36 without the time ordering and therefore their divergencies are removed by the application of ( [ u ] ) . taking this into account",
