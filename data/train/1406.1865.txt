    "to study phase structure of qcd is a challenging and important task .",
    "it is well known that qcd is in the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking phase at the low temperature and small chemical potential , while it is in the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restored phase at the high temperature and large chemical potential .",
    "thus it is widely believed that there exists a phase transition between these two phases . to obtain the phase transition boundary in the @xmath0 phase diagram is a rather difficult task because the qcd coupling constant becomes very strong near the phase transition region and the conventional perturbative method does not work well .",
    "moreover , with the nonzero physical quark masses presented , part of the phase transition line will weaken to a crossover for a range of temperature and chemical potential that makes the phase structure of qcd more complicated to study .",
    "locating the critical point where the phase transition converts to a crossover is an important but difficult task . for a long time , the technique of lattice qcd is the only reliable method to attack these problems .",
    "although lattice qcd works very well for zero density , it encounters the sign problem when considering finite density or chemical potential , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "however , the most interesting region in the qcd phase diagram is at finite density .",
    "the most concerned subjects , such as heavy - ion collisions and compact stars in astrophysics , are all related to qcd at finite density .",
    "recently , lattice qcd has developed some techniques to solve the sign problem , such as reweighting method , imaginary chemical potential method and the method of expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques are only able to deal with the cases of small chemical potentials and quickly lost control for the larger chemical potential .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the current status of lattice qcd .",
    "on the other hand , using the recently developed idea of ads / cft correspondence from string theory , one is able to study qcd in the strongly coupled region by studying its weakly coupled dual gravitational theory , the so called holographic qcd .",
    "the models which are directly constructed from string theory are called top - down models .",
    "the most popular top - down models are d3-d7 @xcite model and d4-d8 ( sakai - sugimoto ) model @xcite . in these top - down holographic qcd models , confinement and chiral symmetry phase transitions in qcd",
    "have been addressed and been translated into geometric transformations in the dual gravity theories .",
    "meson spectrums and their decay constants have also been calculated and compared with the experimental data with surprisingly consistency .",
    "although the top - down qcd models describe many important properties in realistic qcd , the meson spectrums obtained from those models can not realize the linear regge trajectories . to solve this problem ,",
    "another type of holographic models have been developed , i.e. bottom - up models , such as the hard wall model @xcite and the later refined soft - wall model @xcite . in the original soft - wall model ,",
    "the ir correction of the dilaton field was put by hand to obtain the linear regge behavior of the meson spectrum . however , since the fields configuration is put by hand , it does not satisfy the equations of motion . to get a fields configuration which is both consistent with the equation of motions and realizes the linear regge trajectory ,",
    "dynamical soft - wall models were constructed by introduce a dilaton potential @xcite consistently . on the other hand ,",
    "the einstein - dilaton and einstein - maxwell - dilaton models have been widely studied numerically @xcite to investigate the thermodynamical properties and explore the phase structure in qcd .",
    "recently , by a potential reconstruction method , analytic solutions can be obtained in the einstein - dilaton model @xcite and similarly in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to combine the techniques of the dynamical soft - wall model and the potential reconstruction methods to study qcd phase diagram as well as the linear regge spectrum of mesons .",
    "we consider a einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with an arbitrary kinetic gauge function and a dilaton potential as in @xcite .",
    "a family of analytic solutions are obtained by the potential reconstruction method .",
    "we then study its holographic dual qcd model .",
    "the kinetic gauge function can be fixed by requesting the meson spectrums satisfy the linear regge trajectories . by studying the thermodynamics of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton background ,",
    "we calculate the free energy to obtain the phase diagram of our holographic qcd model .",
    "we compute the different equation of states in our model and discuss their behaviors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with a dilaton potential as well as a gauge kinetic function . by potential reconstruction method",
    ", we obtain a family of analytic solutions with arbitrary gauge kinetic function and warped factor .",
    "we then fix the gauge kinetic function by requesting the meson spectrums to realize the linear regge trajectories . by choosing a proper warped factor",
    ", we obtain the final form of our analytic solution . in section iii",
    ", we study the thermodynamics of our gravitational background and compute the free energy to get the phase diagram .",
    "we conclude our result in section iv .",
    "we consider a 5-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with probe flavor fields as in @xcite .",
    "the action of the system have two parts , the background part and the matter part,@xmath3 the background action includes a gravity field @xmath4 , a maxwell field @xmath5 and a neutral dilatonic scalar field @xmath6 . while the matter action includes two flavor fields @xmath7 , representing the left - handed and right - handed gauge fields , respectively .",
    "the kaluza - klein modes of these 5d flavor gauge fields describe the degrees of freedom of mesons on the 4d boundary .",
    "we will treat the matter fields as probe fields and do not consider their backreaction to the background .    in einstein frame , the background action and the matter action can be written as@xmath8   , \\label{action - b}\\\\ s_{m }   &   = -\\dfrac{1}{16\\pi g_{5}}\\int d^{5}x\\sqrt{-g}{\\frac{f\\left ( \\phi\\right )   } { 4}}\\left (   { f_{v}^{2}+f_{\\tilde{v}}^{2}}\\right )   . \\label{action - m}\\ ] ] where we have expressed the flavor fields  @xmath9 and @xmath10  in terms of the vector meson and pseudovector meson fields @xmath11 and @xmath12,@xmath13 the equations of motion can be derived from the actions ( [ action - b ] ) and ( [ action - m ] ) as@xmath14    &   = { { 0,}}\\\\ \\nabla_{\\mu}\\left [   f(\\phi)f_{v}^{\\mu\\nu}\\right ]    &   = { { 0,}}\\label{eom3}\\\\ \\nabla_{\\mu}\\left [   f(\\phi)f_{\\tilde{v}}^{\\mu\\nu}\\right ]    &   = { 0,}\\\\ r_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}r   &   = \\frac{f(\\phi)}{2}\\left (   f_{\\mu\\rho } f_{\\nu}^{\\rho}-\\frac{1}{4}g_{\\mu\\nu}f^{2}+\\left\\ {   { f_{v},f_{\\tilde{v}}}\\right\\ }   \\right )   + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [   \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi-\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}\\left (   \\partial\\phi\\right )   ^{2}-g_{\\mu\\nu } v\\right ]   .",
