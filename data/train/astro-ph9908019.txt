    "methanol masers are found in star forming regions , which manifest themselves as infrared sources , molecular outflows and compact h ii  regions .",
    "they are divided into two classes , i and ii @xcite .",
    "class i methanol masers are not directly associated with any known physical object , but are located in general regions of star formation . by contrast , class  ii methanol masers are usually observed in the vicinity of newly formed luminous stars , and are closely related to ultracompact hii regions and oh masers .",
    "both class  i and ii methanol masers typically emit in several transitions . figs .",
    "[ alevels ] and  [ elevels ] show energy level diagrams , separately for a and e - methanol . in a - methanol",
    "masers occur mostly in transitions between k=1 and k=0 ladders , with class  i maser transitions having their upper energy level in the k=0 ladder and class  ii maser transitions having their upper energy level in the k=1 ladder . in e - methanol",
    "most maser transitions occur between k=0 and k=@xmath21 ladders , with class  i maser transitions having their upper energy level in the k=@xmath21 ladder and class  ii maser transitions having their upper energy level in the k=0 ladder .",
    "the strongest methanol masers are the class  ii masers from the @xmath3 transition at 6.7  ghz @xcite and the @xmath4 transition at 12.2  ghz @xcite .",
    "weaker class  ii methanol masers have been detected at millimeter wavelengths from the @xmath5 transitions at 157  ghz ( slysh , kalenskii & valtts 1995 ) . another millimeter methanol maser line from the @xmath0 transition at 107  ghz ( shown by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ alevels ] ) was discovered at onsala ( sweden ) @xcite . valtts",
    "detected five 107-ghz methanol maser sources , all in the northern hemisphere .",
    "two of them ",
    "cep  a and w3(oh )  have been mapped with high angular resolution using bima ( mehringer , zhou & dickel 1997 ; slysh et  al .",
    "the masers are unresolved by bima , yielding a lower limit on the brightness temperature at 107  ghz of 5@xmath610@xmath7k in w3(oh ) .",
    "to date the only published search for 107-ghz methanol masers is that by valtts et  al . .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an extensive search for 107-ghz methanol emission in the southern hemisphere with the mopra 22-m telescope ( australia ) .",
    "these observations complement the northern hemisphere survey of valtts et  al . and completes a search for 107-ghz methanol maser emission toward sources which show strong 6.7-ghz maser emission . a survey of methanol emission in the @xmath1 transition ( shown by the arrow in fig .  [ elevels ] ) at 108  ghz",
    "was also performed , this represents the first search for maser emission from this transition .",
    "the sources searched for methanol emission at 107 and 108  ghz were selected from 6.7-ghz methanol masers detected by menten , schutte et  al . , caswell et  al .",
    ", van der walt et  al . and slysh et  al . .",
    "this included all 6.7-ghz methanol masers with a peak flux density greater than 50  jy south of declination @xmath821 .",
    "the observations were carried out in the period from july  1 to  17 , 1997 , using the mopra 22-m millimeter - wave telescope of the atnf .",
    "the assumed rest frequencies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions of methanol were 107.01367  ghz @xcite and 108.893940  ghz @xcite respectively . at these frequencies only the inner 15 metres of the mopra antenna is illuminated and the aperture efficiency is 41% , which implies that one kelvin of antenna temperature corresponds to 40  jy for both frequencies .",
    "the half - power beamwidth at 107 and 108.9  ghz is 46and 45@xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the antenna pointing was checked every 12 hours through observations of 86-ghz sio masers , the pointing accuracy of the mopra antenna is 10  rms .",
    "the observations were performed in a position switching mode with reference positions offset 30 .",
    "a cryogenically cooled low - noise sis  mixer was used in the receiver . for the 107-ghz observations the single side - band receiver noise temperature was 140  k and the system temperature varied between 240  k and 325  k depending on weather conditions and the elevation of the telescope ,",
    "while at 108  ghz the single side - band receiver noise temperature was 160  k and the system temperature varied between 255  k and 400  k. an ambient temperature load ( assumed to have a temperature of 290k ) was regularly placed in front of the receiver to enable calibration using the method of kutner & ulich   , this corrects the observed flux density for the effects of atmospheric absorption .",
    "variations in the ambient temperature of a few percent occurred during the observations , and the estimated uncertainty of the absolute flux density scale is 10% .",
    "the back - end was a 64  mhz wide 1024-channel autocorrelator with a frequency resolution of 62.5  khz .",
    "this yielded a velocity resolution at 107  ghz of 0.210  km  s@xmath10 with uniform weighting and 0.350  km  s@xmath10 with hanning smoothing . at 108",
    "ghz the velocity resolution was 0.207  km  s@xmath10 with uniform weighting and 0.344  km  s@xmath10 with hanning smoothing . for each source",
    "a uniformly weighted spectrum was produced with a velocity range of approximately 70  km  s@xmath10 centred on the velocity of the observed 6.7 and 12.2-ghz methanol maser , or cs thermal emission .",
    "the spectrum was then hanning smoothed , as many of the sources are weak this usually improved the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the spectra and gaussian parameters ( peak flux density , velocity and full width half maximum ) in all figures and tables are hanning smoothed data unless otherwise noted .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     it is well established that class  ii methanol masers are typically associated with ultracompact hii  regions @xcite .",
    "the interpretation that the 107 and 108-ghz emission is produced by masing is supported by the results of statistical equilibrium calculations of methanol level excitation by external submillimeter / far  infrared radiation from an ultracompact h ii  region , and de - excitation by collisions with cold gas particles . in table",
    "[ lvgtable ] we present calculations of the relative intensity and optical depth of several class  ii methanol transitions .",
    "the observed and calculated flux densities in the strongest transition @xmath3 at 6.7  ghz were made equal .",
    "the modelling was performed with lvg code kindly supplied to us by dr .",
    "the assumed molecular gas density was 10@xmath11  @xmath12 , temperature 50  k and methanol density divided by velocity gradient @xmath13  @xmath12  ( km  s@xmath10  pc@xmath10)@xmath10 . the source was illuminated by a compact background hii  region with an emission measure of 10@xmath14  @xmath15pc .",
    "the dilution factor was set to 0.2 .",
    "the maser is excited by the combined action of the radiation from the compact hii  region and collisions between methanol and hydrogen molecules .",
    "the collision selection rules employed in the model are based on the paper by lees & haque   and imply that the @xmath16 collisions are preferred .",
    "all the transitions from table  [ lvgtable ] are inverted in our model .",
    "one can see in table  [ lvgtable ] a qualitative agreement between observed and calculated flux densities for all transitions ; however , the quantitative agreement is good for the @xmath4 transition at 12  ghz , but at higher frequencies the calculated flux density is systematically higher by a factor 3 to 10 . a more complicated model with regions of different temperature and density may well give a better agreement with observations .",
    "in addition , the required emission measure @xmath17  @xmath15pc seems to be too high , as no compact hii  region with an emission measure of greater than 5@xmath610@xmath18  @xmath15pc has been observed to date . nevertheless , the qualitative agreement of the theory and observations for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions implies that both of them are class  ii methanol masers and that the maser emission in these transitions is excited by external radiation .",
    "1 .   as a result of a survey in the southern hemisphere 16 methanol emission sources were detected in the @xmath0 transition at 107  ghz .",
    "this survey together with a similar survey made with the onsala telescope completes a whole sky survey of methanol emission at 107  ghz .",
    "six new 107-ghz methanol masers were detected among 16 emission sources . together with masers from the northern survey this makes a total of eleven 107-ghz methanol masers .",
    "they belong to class  ii .",
    "3 .   a survey for methanol emission in the @xmath1 transition at 108",
    "ghz has been carried out in the southern hemisphere with the detection of 16 new emission sources .",
    "one maser was found , also of class  ii .",
    "the relative intensity of the class  ii methanol transitions is consistent with a maser model with radiative excitation and collisional de - excitation .",
