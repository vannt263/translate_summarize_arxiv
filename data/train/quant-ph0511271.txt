    "free energy is among the most important concepts of thermodynamics since it formalizes the fact that the usability of energy resources depends also on their _ entropy_. roughly speaking",
    ", the idea is that in an energy conversion process the target system should typically be provided with energy without transferring entropy ( like increasing the kinetic of potential energy or a macroscopic body , for instance ) .",
    "therefore , the worth of a system for being an energy source depends on the question to what extent one can extract energy from it without releasing too much entropy @xmath1 since the transfer of the dispensable entropy to the environment requires the additional amount @xmath2 of energy ( here @xmath3 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath4 is the temperature of the heat reservoir where the entropy is transferred to , e.g. , the environment ) . hence the amount of work that can be extracted from a physical system is not given by its inner energy .",
    "instead , it depends also on the entropy and on a fixed reference temperature , namely the temperature of the environment which is potentially used as an entropy sink .",
    "conversely , a system that has no inner energy at all ( like a degenerate two - level system ) can be used to extract energy from the environment if its physical state is not the maximal entropy state . in other words , _ information _ can directly be used to extract work from the surrounding heat bath @xcite .",
    "this fact implies on the other hand that the initialization of bits requires energy resources , an observation which is usually referred to as landauer s principle ( cp .",
    "all these statements can be brought into a consistent picture by the notion of free energy : for instance , the initialization of a non - degenerate two - level system to a well defined pure state increases its free energy and requires therefore resources of free energy .    for a quantum system with density operators @xmath5 and hamiltonian @xmath6 one can define ( in analogy to the classical definition , see @xcite ) the free energy by the difference @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the von - neumann entropy with von - neumann entropy in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , it goes beyond the scope of this article to discuss this issue .",
    "we assume here that the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) is nevertheless a reasonable quantity for quantum thermodynamics .",
    "] of @xmath5 . since the gibbs state @xmath9 minimizes ( [ free1 ] ) it",
    "is convenient to redefine free energy by @xmath10 implying that @xmath11 if and only if @xmath12 .    it is known that no physical process which uses no additional energy resources can convert @xmath5 into a state @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "this follows already from the fact that @xmath15 is up to the constant @xmath16 the kullback - leibler distance between @xmath5 and @xmath17 @xcite and that it is not possible to create non - equilibrium states from @xmath17 without using additional energy resources .",
    "therefore @xmath17 is invariant with respect to all those operations and to increase @xmath18 would mean to increase the distance to @xmath17 in contradiction to the fact that no operation can increase kullback - leibler distances between density operators @xcite .    even though the monotonicity of free energy is maybe the most important constraint on the possible operations one should not forget that additional constraints arise in particular for quantum systems .",
    "however , they depend on additional assumptions on the set of physical processes . refs .",
    "@xcite consider work extraction from quantum systems by unitary operations . in these models , the amount of extractable work does not only depend on the inner energy and the entropy of the system .",
    "instead , it can only be calculated from more detailed information on the spectrum of the density operator .    in @xcite",
    "we have furthermore considered _ timing information _ as a kind of thermodynamic resource .",
    "the idea was the following . defining a physical system that includes all available clocks ,",
    "no operation on the joint system can increase the information about an externally defined time reference frame .",
    "every quantum state that is prepared in a superposition of different energy eigenstates with well - defined phase with respect to the external reference frame , provides some information on the latter . the impossibility to create information on the external time",
    "can also be interpreted as the impossibility to prepare superpositions of different energy eigenstates with well - defined phase . such kind of coherent superpositions are therefore a special kind of deviation from equilibrium which could be considered as a resource in its own right .",
    "whereas the complexity for communicating reference frames for time , position , and orientation has been extensively studied in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) and its cryptographic power has been pointed out @xcite , the thermodynamical relevance of reference frames has mainly be considered in @xcite and @xcite . whereas the first article considers the thermodynamic cost of establishing reference frames with classical communication , the authors in @xcite observe that the worth of thermodynamic resources is reduced by missing reference frames .",
    "the latter observation is the venue of this article .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cov ] we sketch the idea to restrict the set of operations to covariant maps , i.e. , those that can be implemented without refering to an external frame .",
    "we rephrase the idea of vaccaro et al .",
    "@xcite to consider a thermodynamic theory that is modified by the additional constraint of covariance .    in section [ sec : split ] we will show explicitly that the covariance condition implies a splitting of free energy into two terms which can not be converted into each other .",
    "we refine this splitting of free energy into arbitrarily many terms reflecting the fact that different kind of timing information that refer to different _ time scales _ can not be converted into each other .",
    "the theory can be generalized to other covariance conditions that may stem , for instance , from missing spatial or rotational reference frames provided that the considered unitary symmetry operation commutes with the hamiltonian . in section [ sec : super ] we argue why the splitting loses its relevance in the macroscopic limit of a large number of identical systems . in section [ sec : appl ] we will show that the results have implications also for situations where reference frames are available .",
    "this is because every covariant operation that decreases one kind of free energy decreases also the total amount of free energy and this loss is clearly irreversible even if a reference frame is available .",
    "we sketch how to apply this idea to time - invariant passive devices ( i.e. devices without energy source ) in optics or in electrical engineering .",
    "then our results imply that a device that causes an indeterministic time delay of the output signal causes necessarily a loss of free energy .",
    "the set of possible operations on a quantum system is given by the set of completely positive trace - preserving maps @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have argued that not every cp map @xmath19 can be implemented if no time reference frame is available .",
    "consider a quantum system with free evolution @xmath20 assume that the state @xmath5 was prepared at time @xmath21 .",
    "if a person implements an operation @xmath19 at time instant @xmath22 the state of the system after @xmath19 was implemented is described by @xmath23 looking at the system later it is described by the state @xmath24 if @xmath25 is the time that has passed since the system was prepared . if no clock was available during the implementation of @xmath19 , it is implemented at a random time instant @xmath22 .",
    "we may therefore define a cp map @xmath26 that results from averaging ( [ rtime ] ) over all @xmath27 .",
    "if the quantum system has discrete spectrum and @xmath25 is large compared to the time scale given by the inverse of the minimal distance between its energy eigenvalues , @xmath26 satisfies approximatively the covariance condition @xmath28 in @xcite we have therefore assumed that the set of operations which can be performed without additional clock is given by those that satisfy the above covariance condition ( [ cov ] ) . in @xcite we have analyzed this class of cp maps in full detail .    with the same arguments one can restrict the set of available operations to those satisfying covariance conditions with respect to other symmetry groups if the corresponding reference frame is not available .",
    "interesting instances are given by the group of space translations or by the rotation symmetry @xcite .",
    "the symmetry is represented by a unitary group @xmath29 acting on the hilbert space of the considered system .",
    "we assume that @xmath30=0 $ ] , otherwise @xmath31 would not be a symmetry group of the hamiltonian and the missing reference frame would even make the definition of @xmath6 impossible .",
    "every transformation is covariant with respect to @xmath0 , i.e. , we can only implement a cp map @xmath19 with @xmath32    it has already been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the absence of a reference frame puts thermodynamically relevant constraints on the set of available operations .",
    "the idea is that the system may contain some information that is not accessible without using the frame .",
    "the authors assume that the work extractable from a @xmath33-dimensional system being in the mixed state @xmath5 is usually ( if a reference frame is available ) given by @xmath34 note that this definition of extractable work refers actually to thermodynamics in degenerate systems or the infinite temperature limit , where the hamiltonian of the system is irrelevant and the free energy @xmath15 is given by the difference of the entropy to the maximally mixed state . within this thermodynamic perspective @xcite",
    "all maximally mixed states are free resources whereas usual ( finite temperature and non - degenerate ) thermodynamics assumes all gibbs states to be free and `` worthless '' resources . to consider @xmath18 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ freetotal ] ) as the extractable work is therefore a bit more general",
    ". we will refer to these two points of view as the finite and the infinite temperature picture , respectively .",
    "if no reference frame is available , the extractable work reduces to @xmath35 instead of ( [ free ] ) ( as the authors of @xcite observe ) , where @xmath36 is the average of @xmath5 over the orbit of @xmath0 , where we have implicitly assumed for the moment that @xmath0 is a compact group and denoted its haar measure by @xmath37 .",
    "introducing the reference information by @xmath38 the deficit between the terms ( [ free ] ) and ( [ cofree ] ) is @xmath39 , a term called asymmetry in @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is non - increasing under covariant operations since no trace - preserving cp map can increase the holevo information .",
    "then the statement follows because no local operation on one system can increase the mutual information @xcite of the joint system . ] . the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite prove that even covariant operations that include measurements can not increase the average asymmetry as long as the probabilities for the measurement outcomes are @xmath0-invariant .",
    "they consider a family @xmath40 of maps where each @xmath40 is a covariant cp map and show that the average asymmetry of the conditional post measurement states @xmath41 with @xmath42 can not exceed the initial asymmetry .",
    "however , this generalization needs not explicitly be made when we include a toy version of a measurement apparatus into the description .",
    "one can check that there exists a covariant map @xmath19 that transfers the state @xmath43 where the state @xmath44 indicates that @xmath45 was measured . assuming that the group acts trivially on the ancilla system , the asymmetry of the state ( [ meas ] ) coincides with the average asymmetry of the ensemble @xmath46 .",
    "since we know that @xmath19 can not increase the asymmetry of ( [ inas ] ) , the average post - measurement asymmetry can not be increased either .    in the following section",
    "we will show that the observations of @xcite can be generalized to the finite temperature setting and give rise to two kinds of free energy .",
    "the key statement of this section is that the different components in which we decompose the free energy are independent resources in the sense that no covariant channel can increase them without access to an additional energy resource . to state this formally ,",
    "we will use the notion of a passive channel :    a trace - preserving cp map @xmath19 acting on a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath6 is called passive if @xmath47 with the thermal state @xmath48 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "we have already seen that passivity implies @xmath49 . to define our decomposition of free energy , we assume for the moment that the considered quantum system has discrete energy spectrum such that the time average @xmath50 exists .",
    "it is then given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the family of energy eigenprojections .",
    "we write the free energy @xmath15 as @xmath53 and use the fact that averaging over the time can only decrease the free energy since the energy term in ( [ freetotal ] ) remains the same .",
    "then we have @xmath54 and conclude @xmath55 where we call @xmath56 the _ covariant free energy_. note that @xmath56 can be considered as the natural generalization of the accessible work @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ cofree ] ) to our finite temperature setting . to see that @xmath56 is non - increasing",
    "when applying passive channels we observe that a covariant channel @xmath19 that converts a state @xmath5 to another state @xmath58 must necessarily convert @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the channel @xmath19 is therefore only passive if @xmath61 .",
    "this shows that asymmetry as well as covariant free energy are both non - increasing under passive covariant operations .",
    "we rephrase these observations as a theorem :    [ mainvor ] the free energy of a quantum system with discrete energy levels can be decomposed into @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the holevo information of the time orbit and @xmath56 is the free energy of the orbit average .",
    "the terms @xmath64 and @xmath56 are both non - negative and non - increasing with respect to time - covariant passive operations .",
    "theorem [ mainvor ] can be generalized in two respects .",
    "first , we may have an arbitrary group representation instead of the time evolution provided that it leaves the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "then the term @xmath65 is preserved by averaging , too .",
    "second , we need not necessarily consider uniform averaging over the whole group . instead , we can define hierarchies of states , obtained by averaging more and more over the group , and calculate free energy differences between more and less mixed states . by this procedure",
    ", we obtain a splitting of free energy into many independent terms .",
    "we phrase this idea also as a theorem :    given a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath66 and hamiltonian @xmath6 .",

    "let @xmath80 be the dirac measure on the identity .",
    "let @xmath81 be the cp map given by the average @xmath82    then the free energy @xmath15 splits up into the @xmath71 terms @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 all terms @xmath86 for @xmath87 are non - negative and non - increasing with respect to passive covariant operations .",
    "[ th : main ]    @xmath88 is clearly non - negative . to see that it is non - increasing we observe @xmath89 where the last inequality is due to the monotonicity of usual free energy under passive operations .",
    "the terms @xmath86 for @xmath90 are , up to the constant @xmath91 , given by the entropy difference @xmath92 with @xmath93 this follows easily from @xmath94 .",

    "it is therefore non - negative . to show that it is non - increasing when applying @xmath19 we observe that the covariance implies @xmath96 and @xmath97 is therefore , up to the constant @xmath16 , the holevo information of the ensemble @xmath98 according to the probability measure @xmath72",
    ". then monotonicity of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath19 follows from the monotonicity of holevo information .",
    "the advantage of theorem [ th : main ] compared to the preceding remarks is not only that it allows a splitting into more than two terms .",
    "it is furthermore important that it allows a splitting for non - compact groups since it does not refer to a uniform average over the whole group .",
    "we will now restrict our attention again to the splitting into two free energy terms like in the beginning of section [ sec : split ] and investigate how these quantities behave when systems are composed to joint systems .",
    "let us consider a two - level system with lower and upper state , denoted by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the energy gap between both levels . if @xmath102 its equilibrium state is almost the maximally mixed state @xmath103 .",
    "the free energy of the state @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 one checks easily that @xmath106 is negligible compared to the first term since @xmath107 and the entropy difference between @xmath108 and @xmath48 is small .",
    "to see the asymptotics of many copies of @xmath109 we observe that the entropy of the time average of @xmath110 is exactly the entropy of the binomial distribution @xmath111 with @xmath112 hence the entropy of the average of @xmath110 increases only with @xmath113 since the measure is supported by only @xmath71 different points . in other words , there are only @xmath71 different eigenspaces of the joint hamiltonian @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the pauli matrix @xmath116 acting on qubit @xmath45 . for the same reasons ,",
    "the covariant free energy of @xmath110 can be bounded from below by @xmath117 .",
    "hence the asymmetry part of the free energy is for large @xmath71 more and more a negligible fraction of the total free energy .",
    "similar arguments apply to the general situation .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the splitting is completely irrelevant for large particle numbers .",
    "instead , the results show that every process that increases the covariant free energy of some of the particles requires interactions between them .",
    "hence the amount of increase of covariant free energy can bound the number of interacting particles from below .",
    "therefore the results imply statements on the _ complexity _ of the considered process .",
    "this kind of complexity issues are related to the questions discussed in @xcite where we have discussed the complexity of molecular heat engines .",
    "the key observation was that the additional constraints for energy conversion processes that arise in simple quantum systems imply statements on the complexity of energy conversion processes in macroscopic ensembles of particles .",
    "for the sake of completeness we sketch the proof of the superadditivity of covariant free energy .",
    "then the subadditivity of the asymmetry term follows because total free energy is additive .",
    "the essential observation is that for two states @xmath5 and @xmath58 with time evolution @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , the entropy of the joint time average @xmath120 can not be greater than the entropy of the tensor product of the averages , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "this is because the latter state can be obtained from the former by averaging over all possible _ relative _ time translations @xmath122 .",
    "we have therefore @xmath123",
    "remarkably , the results above have also implications for situations where a reference frame is available since every passive covariant operation that decreases one term @xmath86 necessarily decreases the total free energy since it is unable to convert one kind of free energy into the other .",
    "this can be used to derive lower bounds on the loss of free energy of a physical signal like an electrical pulse or a light pulse when it passes a device such that it degrades the time accuracy of the pulse .",
    "we will explain this idea using a system with discrete energy levels as a toy model for the physical signal .",
    "consider for instance a system which has some integer values @xmath124 as energy spectrum . due to the periodicity , we can restrict its group of time translations to @xmath125 . parameterizing @xmath0 by the interval",
    "@xmath126 $ ] we obtain the unitary representation @xmath127 now we consider an input state @xmath5 which is perfectly distinguishable from its time evolved state @xmath128 for some @xmath129 in the sense that @xmath130 let @xmath19 be a passive time covariant operation that corrupts the timing information of @xmath5 in the sense that the corresponding output density matrices @xmath131 and @xmath132 are not perfectly distinguishable .",
    "then we can use the results of section [ sec : split ] to bound the free energy loss of the channel from below as follows . define a measure on @xmath133 by @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 denote the dirac measures at the time instants @xmath21 and @xmath137 , respectively . by applying theorem [ th : main ] using the measures @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the free energy of the input splits up into @xmath140 and for the output into @xmath141 the fact that the output states are not perfectly distinguishable is equivalent to the statement that the holevo information of an ensemble that consists of the states @xmath131 and @xmath142 with probability @xmath143 each is strictly less than @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "then the loss of free energy satisfies @xmath146 the intuitive content of this statement is that it provides lower bounds on the free energy loss caused by devices that corrupt the time accuracy of the input signal by generating output signals with stochastic time delay .    to consider a more concrete physical situation ,",
    "assume some electrical , acoustical , or optical signal enters a passive device whose input - output behavior is described by the time covariant map @xmath19 .",
    "the time covariance reflects only the fact that the state of the physical device is stationary before the signal enters into it ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "assume that the channel converts some input signal that can be perfectly distinguished from its time evolved copy that is defined by a time shift @xmath147 in the sense that the quantum states @xmath5 and @xmath148 are mutually orthogonal density operators .",
    "assume that the channel generates an unknown time delay such that the output density operators @xmath131 and @xmath149 are not perfectly distinguishable .",
    "then the fluctuation of the time delay leads necessarily to a loss of free energy .",
    "one may argue that these fluctuations would obviously lead to a loss of free energy of the signal since they increase the entropy of the state .",
    "however , a priori it is not clear whether the channel could change the probability distribution of energy values such that the loss of free energy caused by an increase of entropy is compensated by an increase of the inner energy @xmath65 .",
    "the statement that no covariant channel can do such a compensation is the key statement of this article .",
    "the signal above is assumed to pass the device only once . by applying our results to such a situation with aperiodic dynamics",
    "we have actually ignored the fact that it refers necessarily to continuous spectrum .",
    "otherwise the free evolution of the signal would be quasiperiodic .",
    "we may remove this by letting it oscillate between distant mirrors for obtaining discrete energy spectrum .",
    "the problem with the aperiodic limit is anyway that it refers to an infinite amount of free energy .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "given a density operator @xmath5 such that for some @xmath150 all states @xmath151 for @xmath152 are perfectly distinguishable from @xmath5 .",
    "then one can choose an arbitrary probability measure on @xmath153 by @xmath154 with @xmath155 and observe @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the shannon entropy of @xmath158 . by choosing measures @xmath158",
    "with diverging entropy one can show that the free and recalling that @xmath18 is always non - negative , the statement follows .",
