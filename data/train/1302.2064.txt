    "<S> collisions of heavy ions at high energies provide opportunity to study non - linear dynamics of strong qcd color fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field of a very dense system of color charges at rapidities far from the source is determined by the classical yang - mills equations with a recoilless current along the light cone  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of gluons characterized by a transverse momentum @xmath4 on the order of the density of valence charges per unit transverse area @xmath5  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; this _ saturation momentum _ scale separates the regime of non - linear color field interactions at @xmath6 or distances @xmath7 from the perturbative regime at @xmath8 . near the center of a large nucleus </S>",
    "<S> this scale is expected to exceed @xmath9  gev at bnl - rhic or cern - lhc collider energies , for a probe in the adjoint representation of the color gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> the classical field solution provides the leading contribution to an expansion in terms of the coupling and of the inverse saturation momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> the soft field produced in a collision of two nuclei is then a solution of the yang - mills equations satisfying appropriate matching conditions on the light cone  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , right after the impact strong longitudinal chromo - magnetic fields @xmath10 develop due to the fact that the individual projectile and target fields do not commute  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they fluctuate according to the random local color charge densities of the valence sources . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that magnetic loops @xmath11 exhibit area law behavior , and we compute the magnetic string tension . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that at length scales @xmath12 the field configurations might be viewed as uncorrelated z(n ) vortices . at finite times @xmath13 after the collision area law behavior is observed even for rather small wilson loops . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we sketch how the background of magnetic fields affects propagation of semi - hard particles with transverse momenta somewhat above @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a spatial wilson loop with radius @xmath14 in the plane transverse to the beams , m(r ) & = & p ( ig _ -^d a^i ) + w_m(r ) & = &  , [ eq : w_m ] where @xmath15 , and path ordering is with respect to the angle @xmath16 ; in numerical lattice simulations it is more convenient to employ a square loop . </S>",
    "<S> we compare , also , to the expectation value of the z(@xmath17 ) part of the loop ; for a magnetic field configuration corresponding simply to a superposition of independent vortices the loop should equal @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the total vortex charge piercing the loop . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for two colors we compute [ eq : w_m_z2 ] w_m^z(2)(r ) = where @xmath20 denotes the sign function . comparing  ( [ eq : w_m ] ) to  ( [ eq : w_m_z2 ] ) tests the interpretation that the drop - off of @xmath21 is due to z(@xmath17 ) vortices , without requiring gauge fixing of the su(@xmath17 ) links  @xcite .    the field in the forward light cone immediately after a collision  @xcite , at proper time @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> is given in light cone gauge by @xmath23 . in turn , before the collision the individual fields of projectile and target are 2d pure gauges , [ eq : alphai ] ^i_m = u_m ^i u_m^  ,   ^i ^i_m = g _ m  , where @xmath24 labels projectile and target , respectively , and @xmath25 are su(n ) gauge fields .    eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> the large-@xmath26 valence charge density @xmath27 is a random variable this variable denotes the light - cone momentum of a parton relative to the beam hadron and should not be confused with a transverse coordinate . ] . for a large nucleus , the effective action describing color charge fluctuations is quadratic , [ eq : s2 ] s_eff[^a ] =  ,   ^a(*x * ) ^b ( * y*)=^2 ^ab ( * x*-*y * )  , with @xmath28 proportional to the thickness of a given nucleus  @xcite . the variance of color charge fluctuations determines the saturation scale @xmath29  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse - grained effective action  ( [ eq : s2 ] ) applies to ( transverse ) area elements containing a large number of large-@xmath26 `` valence '' charges , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the densities @xmath31 at two different points are independent so that their correlation length within the effective theory is zero . however , this is not so for the gauge fields @xmath32 which do exhibit a finite screening length  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it exhibits area law behavior for loops larger than @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding `` magnetic string tension '' is @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the area law indicates uncorrelated magnetic flux fluctuations through the wilson loop and that the area of magnetic vortices is rather small , their radius being on the order of @xmath35 . we do not observe a breakdown of the area law up to @xmath36 , implying that vortex correlations are small at such distance scales </S>",
    "<S> also , restricting to the z(2 ) part reduces the magnetic flux through small loops but @xmath37 is comparable to the full su(2 ) result , if somewhat smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerically small vortex size that we find is _ parametrically _ consistent with the classical gaussian approximation at weak coupling which , as already mentioned above , applies for areas @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> corrections to @xmath39 of higher order in @xmath27  @xcite as well as due to quantum fluctuations  @xcite of the fields should be investigated in the future .    since the field @xmath40 of a single nucleus is a pure gauge it follows that @xmath41 . however , beyond linear order the field in the forward light cone , @xmath42 is not a pure gauge and so @xmath43 . as discussed in the appendix , for small loops the correction w_m(_1^i+_2^i ) - 1 ~- a^2 [ eq : w_m_pert ] is proportional to the square of the area of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> there is no contribution at order @xmath44 , hence no area law behavior and no vortices , even though there is , of course , a non - zero longitudinal magnetic field even at the `` naive '' perturbative level : [ eq : bzcorr ] b_z(*r * ) b_z(*r*)= 4 q_s1 ^ 2 q_s2 ^ 2 ^2  .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w_m_pert ] ) applies for small @xmath45 while the non - perturbative lattice result exhibits area law behavior at @xmath46 for @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates the presence of resummed screening corrections for magnetic fields  @xcite . to see this more </S>",
    "<S> explicitly it is useful to notice that @xmath48 is in fact @xmath49 , proportional to the product of single powers of the respective saturation scales of projectile and target . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : mfl_asym ] . </S>",
    "<S> naive perturbation theory can only produce even powers of the two - point function @xmath50 .    to estimate the density of vortices one can consider a simple combinatorial model whereby the area @xmath51 of the loop is covered by patches of size @xmath52 containing a z(2 ) vortex with probability @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : alphai ] ) is boost invariant and so , naively , the two - dimensional vortex structures mentioned above would form boost invariant strings . however , this simple picture could be modified by longitudinal smearing of the valence charge distributions  @xcite and therefore requires more detailed consideration .    </S>",
