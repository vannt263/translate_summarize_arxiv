    "the depinning and retraction of the three - phase contact line by evaporation and the subsequent invasion of cavities by liquid ( cassie - wenzel transition ) were directly observed by confocal microscopy .",
    "the cassie - wenzel transition takes place by the meniscus invading the cavity progressively by increasing the droplet volume inside the cavity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the free - energy barrier must be crossed during the course of invasion . however , no information about the free - energy barrier of the transition was reported .",
    "the cassie - wenzel transition has also been studied by applying the pressure to the liquid of droplet  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we have to study the gibbs free energy  @xcite @xmath125 instead of the helmholtz free energy @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b3 ] ) , where @xmath126 is the applied pressure .",
    "the maximum of the free energy does not occurs when the meniscus becomes flat ( @xmath127 ) . instead",
    ", it occurs when the radius of the liquid - vapor interface @xmath2 is given by the laplace formula  @xcite @xmath128 , and the free - energy barrier is lowered by the amount @xmath129 from that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : b27 ] ) .",
    "then , the cassie - wenzel transition will be accelerated by applying the pressure @xmath130 .",
    "numerically , our result of the free - energy barrier @xmath131 is the same order of magnitude as that obtained for simpler geometry  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the free - energy barrier in our spherical - cavity model will be @xmath132 for the water droplet ( @xmath133 ) in a micro - scale pore  @xcite with @xmath134 and @xmath135 in a nano - scale pore  @xcite with @xmath136 , which would be difficult to detect .",
    "in this study , we considered the volume dependence of the morphology and free energy of a lens - shaped droplet placed on the bottom of a spherical cavity within the capillary model . the line - tension effects were included , and they were expressed by a scaled line tension .",
    "then , the contact angle was determined from the generalized young s equation , which took into account the effects of line tension .",
    "the morphology and the free energy were studied using the mathematically rigorous formula for the free energy  @xcite .",
    "the droplet morphology changed from a spherical droplet to a lens - shaped droplet with a convex meniscus , then , to that with a concave meniscus as the droplet volume increased .",
    "finally , the lens - shaped droplet spread over the whole inner wall of the cavity to leave a spherical bubble .",
    "the free energy showed a barrier as a function of the droplet volume whose maximum occurred when the meniscus became flat .",
    "this free - energy maximum was given by an analytic formula , which showed that the line - tension contribution was largest at the maximum and could not be treated as a small parameter .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the free - energy barrier of filling a spherical cavity , including the line - tension effect .",
    "the line - tension contribution can be important in determining the maximum of the energy barrier .",
    "the positive line tension increases the energy barrier .",
    "thus , the cassie - to - wenzel transition is less probable and the superhydrophobic cassie state is more stable . in this study , we used the simplest capillary model and neglected the noncircular fluctuation of the contact line  @xcite .",
    "the capillary model will be less reliable if the liquid - substrate interaction is long - ranged represented by the disjoining pressure  @xcite .",
    "the noncircular fluctuation will cause instability of the lens - shaped droplet if the line tension is negative , although the higher - order contribution  @xcite will stabilize the fluctuation .",
