    "we present results from a survey of x - ray point sources in xmm - newton observations of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "m31 is the nearest spiral galaxy to our own , at 760 kpc @xcite , and its x - ray population is dominated by x - ray binaries .",
    "our work differs from previous surveys of m31 in two important ways .",
    "firstly , we made power density spectra ( pds ) from combined epic , background subtracted lightcurves of each source .",
    "this was made possible for the first time by the unprecedented sensitivity of xmm - newton , allowing us to detect variability in m31 x - ray sources on @xmath0100 s timescales .",
    "secondly , we obtained the 0.310 kev luminosity of each source from best fit models to their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ; previous works have used an assumed model to convert from count rate to luminosity in all but the brightest few sources .    we have examined four xmm - newton observations of the central region of m31 , along with one observation each of the north 1 , north 2 , north 3 , south 1 and south 2 fields ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we performed automated source detection on these regions , and found 535 sources that were observed by all three epic detectors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details )",
    ". however , we have not yet studied these sources in a uniform manner .",
    "x - ray binaries exhibit many phenomena on time - scales spanning milliseconds to years .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are particularly interesting because they exhibit very distinctive power density spectra that depend more on the accretion rate than on the nature of the primary . both neutron star and black hole lmxbs exhibit pds that are characterised by a broken power law at low accretion rates ; the spectral index changes from @xmath00 to @xmath01 at a break frequency in the range @xmath00.011 hz @xcite .",
    "we call this type a variability @xcite . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "the pds is described by a simple power law over the some frequency range ; we refer to this as type b variability @xcite .",
    "van der klis ( 1994 ) suggested that the transition from type a to type b variability occurs at some constant accretion rate , and suggested a transition at @xmath01% eddington .",
    "we have empirical evidence that suggests that the transition from type a to type b variability occurs at @xmath010% eddington in the 0.310 kev band @xcite .",
    "since the eddington limit is proportional to the mass of the primary , we expect black hole lmxbs to exhibit type a variability at higher luminosities than neutron star lmxbs .",
    "we assume a maximum neutron star mass of 3.1 m@xmath1 and classify as a possible black hole lmxb any x - ray source that exhibits type a variability at a 0.310 kev luminosity @xmath24@xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we also obtained epic - pn seds for each source in the 0.310 kev band , and an equivalent background sed .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were generated for each source .",
    "the resulting seds were grouped for a minimum of 50 count bin@xmath5 from sources with @xmath2500 counts , and for a minimum of 20 count bin@xmath5 for seds with @xmath6500 counts .",
    "we fitted several spectral models to each sed and obtained the 0.310 kev luminosity from the best fit .",
    "if the source+background spectrum contained @xmath6150 counts , and/or the source spectrum contained @xmath620 counts , then the luminosity was estimated from the 0.310 kev pn intensity ; we assumed an absorbed power law model with line of sight absorption equivalent to 10@xmath7 h atom @xmath8 and a photon index of 1.7 .    by combining pds and",
    "sed information we were able to classify the x - ray population of m31 to an unprecedented degree ; table  [ class ] summarises our classification scheme for lmxbs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not yet have such a scheme for hmxbs .",
    "for luminosity functions of the different regions of m31 , see @xcite .",

    "the initial survey covered the four observations of the 63 brightest sources in the central region of m31 @xcite ; we have yet to study the @xmath0130 remaining sources .",
    "similarly , we have only surveyed 36 out of 87 sources in south 1 region ; this survey also predates the automated source detection .",
    "however , we have studied all 83 sources in north 1 and all 43 sources in north 2 . we have not yet studied any of the 88 sources in north 3 nor the 41 sources in south 2 .",
    "all the remaining sources will be surveyed over the next few months .",
    "we have examined the four observations of the 63 x - ray sources in the core in most detail @xcite ; we were able to classify 107 out of 252 pds as either type a , type b or flat ; flat pds had no significant power above 2 , which is the expected power for poisson noise when using leahy normalisation .",
    "figure  [ pds ] shows examples of type a and type b pds exhibited by m31 x - ray sources during the @xmath060 ks xmm - newton observation on 2002 , january 6 .",
    "furthermore , we found that the type b and flat pds were both consistent with high accretion rate lmxbs in m31 @xcite .    in the core",
    ", 40 out of 63 sources exhibited type a variability in at least one observation ; these are almost certainly x - ray binaries .",
    "a further 6 sources exhibited type b but not type a variability , making them likely lmxbs . in the north 1 and north 2 fields ,",
    "25 out of 83 and 1 out of 43 sources respectively exhibit type a variability ; in the south 1 field , 9 out of 36 sources exhibited type a variability .",
    "of the 40 sources that exhibited type a variability in the core , 13 did so at luminosities @xmath24@xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 , and were classed as black hole candidates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite surveyed these same xmm - newton observations , finding 856 point sources .",
    "they catalogued 7 lmxbs and 9 likely lmxbs , as well as 27 certain and 10 likely associations of x - ray sources with globular clusters .",
    "these 53 sources are all likely lmxbs .",
    "we have surveyed 28 of these sources to date , and find that 10 of them exhibit type a variability .",
    "hence , 71 of the 81 x - ray binary candidates were newly identified by this work . .",
    "[ uvx ] we present a mosaic of galex images of m31 in the far ultraviolet ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* and http://www.galex.caltec.edu ) , with the x - ray sources that we have already studied superposed .",
    "black dots represent x - ray sources that exhibited type a variability in at least one observation , while white dots represent sources that have not .",
    "we note that the central region is dominated by black dots ; 63% of the surveyed sources exhibited type a variability in the core .",
    "meanwhile , 2530% of sources in the north 1 and south 1 regions , and only 2% of sources in north 2 , exhibited type a variability ( see fig .",
    "[ uvx ] ) .    the majority of sources in the north 1 , north 2 and south 1 regions have 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath610@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "almost all the core x - ray sources that we have surveyed in this regime with classified pds show type a variability ; hence we would expect all lmxbs in the m31 disc to exhibit type a variability also .",
    "however , we only detect type a variability in @xmath020% of the disc sources .",
    "furthermore , we see that the disc population of x - ray sources largely follows the spiral arms , suggesting that they are hmxbs .",
    "we therefore suggest that it may be possible to distinguish between lmxbs and hmxbs , based on their pds at 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath610@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ; the hmxbs are not expected to exhibit type a variability as they are not disc fed .",
    "we expect most of the @xmath0130 faint sources in the core to exhibit type a variability ."
