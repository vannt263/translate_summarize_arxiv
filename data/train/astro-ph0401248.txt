    "in the last 30 years our knowledge of the interstellar neutral hydrogen ( h  ) in the galaxy has expanded dramatically .",
    "many of the discoveries came from emission - absorption studies towards continuum background sources at 1420 mhz .",
    "perhaps the most important realization of the early surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was that the emission line - widths are clearly broader than the corresponding absorption , indicating that the emitting gas must be dominated by a much warmer phase than the absorbing gas .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite analyzed the spin temperature ( @xmath3 ) , and found values from approximately 40 k up to several thousand kelvin , peaking between 80 k and 150 k. due to the probable mix of cold and warm gas , the physical interpretation of @xmath3 has remained difficult .",
    "@xcite applied a two - component model to absorption and emission data and found cold phase temperatures in agreement with the above spin temperatures .",
    "however two recent studies @xcite , fitting individual features , find the cold component temperature peaking between 40 k and 60 k. @xcite also finds the warm component ranging from roughly 1000 k to 9000 k. this puts ideas about the ism existing in distinct stable temperature and density regimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into question .",
    "we also do not have a firm theoretical or observational basis on the lower limit ( if such exists ) of the cold component temperature , before most of the gas becomes molecular .    addressing the variation with galactocentric radius , @xcite state that the supernova - dominated mckee - ostriker ( mo ) model @xcite might describe the inner galaxy better , while the outer ,",
    "more quiescent , galaxy is better described by the fgh model @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite define the mean opacity , @xmath4 , as the optical depth line of the sight integral divided by the radial velocity change due to the rotation curve , for radial increments in the galaxy .",
    "they found an decrease in @xmath4 with increasing radius in the first and fourth quadrant respectively .",
    "overall , however , our knowledge of the radial variation of the ism phases is still quite limited .",
    "this is mainly because of the time requirements to observe a large number of sources over a wide area of the galactic plane at the sensitivity needed to get a good source density .",
    "new surveys , as those used by @xcite and @xcite , are starting to give us a much better picture of the h  states and the variations with galactocentric radius .",
    "we present a new emission - absorption study toward compact continuum background sources in the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , * ? ? ?",
    "we have applied an `` on - off method '' to extract the emission brightness temperature and optical depth toward the sources . due to the high resolution and sensitivity of the cgps we are able to study the radial variation of the h  temperature and density for a much higher source density in the galactic plane than ever before .",
    "section 2 gives an overview of the cgps and the on - off method used . in section 3",
    "we present the spin temperatures and the results of a simple two - temperature model .",
    "further we discuss the spatial variation of the h  column density , and the correlation with co. we also present a brief analysis of absorption feature statistics .",
    "section 4 summarizes our results and indicates some areas of future research .",
    "the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite is a multi - wavelength study at 1 arc - minute resolution from galactic longitude 74to 147 , and latitude -3.6to 5.6 .",
    "the observations for the 21 cm dataset were carried out with the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) synthesis array , near penticton , canada ( for a description , see * ? ? ?",
    "the array consists of seven 9-metre antennas .",
    "four of the antennas are movable to yield a total of 12 configurations , or 144 baselines . for the survey each field",
    "was observed in each position for 12 hours to obtain full uv - sampling .",
    "short spacing data were taken with the drao 26-m single dish telescope . at 21-cm",
    "the cgps images have a spatial resolution of 1@xmath51cosec(@xmath6 ) .",
    "the instrumental velocity resolution of 1.319 km / s is sampled every 0.824 km / s , covering lsr velocities from approximately 40 km / s to -160 km / s .",
    "the rms noise of the emission in a single velocity channel at the field centres is about 3 k in low emission regions , and up to 6 k in high emission regions @xcite .",
    "the continuum data are taken in four 7.5 mhz bands ( centred on 1406.9 mhz , 1413.8 mhz , 1427.4 mhz , and 1434.3 mhz ) . a technical matter of importance for our work",
    "is the fact that a slightly different uv - taper is applied to the ( continuum subtracted ) h  datacube than the continuum maps .",
    "we convolved the cgps continuum maps to match the beam shapes exactly . for a detailed description of the data acquisition and reduction process",
    "see @xcite .      for this study",
    "we have identified 437 compact sources with a peak continuum brightness temperature higher than 30 k in the cgps , corresponding to integrated flux densities higher than 150 mjy .",
    "the cut - off value of 30 k was chosen because the absorption signal to noise for sources below this temperature is almost always less than 1 .",
    "this gives a source density of about 0.6 sources per square degree in the cgps area .",
    "figure  [ fig : sloc ] shows the source locations .",
    "the sources provide a fairly uniform coverage of this section of the galactic plane .",
    "note that we do not exclude any sources that might be of galactic origin . by inspecting the emission versus absorption velocity cut - offs we find about 15 potential galactic sources .",
    "past emission - absorption studies typically used one on - source position and several off - source positions distributed around the source to approximate the `` unabsorbed '' spectrum ( e.g. a hexagonal pattern , see @xcite ) . for this work a different approach was taken , since we have a fully sampled , mosaiced dataset .",
    "first , the continuum sources were fitted with 2-d elliptical gaussians .",
    "an average off - source emission brightness temperature , @xmath7 , was then extracted in a one arc - minute wide elliptical annulus , with its inner edge tracing the fitted ellipse in shape but scaled to be one fwhm from the centre .",
    "most sources are unresolved , so the annuli are typically approximately one arc - minute ( one beamwidth ) away from the source centre .",
    "the rms variations in @xmath8 over the annulus give an estimate of the emission error .",
    "the off temperature is assumed to represent the emission on - source in the absence of continuum absorption .",
    "it is thus important to keep the separation between the on and off measurement directions as small as possible . at 1 kpc line of sight distance ,",
    "one arc - minute corresponds to about 0.3 pc .",
    "an average optical depth ( @xmath9 ) was computed from the on - source spectrum using pixel values within one hwhm from the centre of the background source , and any pixels further away for which the emission temperature signal to noise was higher than 5 . under local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) the optical depth in any channel is then given by @xmath10 = \\left<1-\\frac{t_{b } - t_{on}(x , y)}{t_{bg}(x , y)}\\right>\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the continuum brightness temperature of the background source and @xmath12 is the continuum subtracted profile at the pixel location ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "typically about 10 pixels per channel are used in the average optical depth computation .",
    "the spin temperature is derived by , @xmath14 note that for large optical depth , @xmath15 approaches @xmath11 . due to noise in the data",
    "the optical depth can diverge .",
    "this situation was typically encountered for at least a few channels in any given spectrum . since this corresponds to completely optically thick gas , we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 equal to zero and @xmath8 respectively in these cases .    to test our on - off method we inserted absorption from artificial background sources into the data cubes .",
    "the artificial continuum sources were gaussian shaped to match the synthesized beam and had peak brightness temperatures ranging from 30 k to 300 k. the line emission brightness temperature in each channel was modified at the position of the artificial source in proportion to the background source intensity and the h  brightness in that channel at the source position .",
    "the resulting absorption spectra were extracted using the on - off method and compared to the known input profiles .",
    "the agreement between the two was consistently well within one sigma for both the spin temperatures and optical depth spectra .",
    "we also compared spectra common to this study and @xcite .",
    "in general the agreement is good , but in noisy channels they sometimes differ by several @xmath18 .",
    "figures  [ fig : spec01 ] and [ fig : spec02 ] show two representative spectra , illustrating the quality of the data for two sources with very different continuum brightness temperatures .",
    "we do not show all the spectra in this paper due to their large number .",
    "all the spectral data are available online ( _ http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/cgps/products/ _ ) or by request from s. strasser . some features are common to many spectra",
    ". we can almost always identify the local ( 10 to -20 km / s ) and perseus arms ( around -25 to -50 km / s ) as broad peaks in emission , and in many cases also the outer arm ( between -80 and -110 km / s ) . in general",
    "the absorption spectra show more structure and narrower line widths than the emission spectra .",
    "however this difference is less pronounced than for past , lower angular resolution , studies .",
    "some features follow the `` @xmath19 relation '' ( @xmath20 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath21 ) quite nicely .",
    "this is attributed to the difference in absorption versus emission line widths , as the former is dominated by cool gas , and the latter by the warm component . in many cases however , the observed relation is more in the shape of a loop , where the spin temperature for a given optical depth on one side of the feature is systematically higher or lower than on the other side .",
    "several recent studies confirm this relationship ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spin temperature ( @xmath3 ) is the simplest temperature indicator we can compute . under assumption of a single - component medium in equilibrium",
    "it is equal to the kinetic temperature of the gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of spin temperatures is given in figure  [ fig : tshist ] for all channels with s / n@xmath22 ) @xmath23 5 ( 6318 channels in total ) .",
    "the median of the distribution is 120 k , and 90% of the values lie between 60 k and about 280 k. this is in rough agreement with previous studies @xcite and recent results for the southern galactic plane @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed though that the neutral hydrogen has at least two components , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "the spin temperature measures a harmonic mean of the cnm and wnm , weighted by the column density of each component .",
    "it therefore only provides us with an upper limit to the true cold component temperature and a lower limit to the warm component temperature .",
    "this is confirmed by more recent analyses that fit the cnm and wnm separately and find lower cold component h  temperatures than the associated spin temperatures . by fitting profiles with gaussian functions",
    "@xcite find cold component temperatures in the range from about 10 k to 75 k. @xcite use a novel technique of fitting the emission and absorption and find a range for the cold temperature between 20 k and 110 k , much lower than their spin temperatures .",
    "we have applied a two - component model to the data extracted from the cgps .",
    "our approach is similar to a model applied to the galaxy and m31 by @xcite .",
    "we use the transfer equation for a case where two components contribute to the emission brightness temperature : @xmath24}\\ ] ] here we assume that the gas has a cold component at temperature @xmath1 and optical depth @xmath25 and a warm component at temperature @xmath26 with optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "a fraction @xmath28 of the warm gas is in front of the cold gas at every velocity . the first term in equation  [ eqn : multi ] represents wnm emission in front of the cnm .",
    "the second term accounts for the cnm emission , absorbed by the wnm in front .",
    "the third term represents the wnm behind the cold component , which is absorbed by both the cnm and wnm foregrounds . since @xmath29",
    ", we further assume that the absorption due to the wnm is much smaller than that due to the cnm and that the wnm does not absorb the cnm .",
    "for @xmath30 and @xmath31 we then derive @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the limits of @xmath35 as @xmath36 goes to zero and infinity respectively .",
    "note that , even though these limiting temperatures are functions of velocity , we treat them as constants by assuming that @xmath27 is approximately constant .",
    "we make this assumption because we fit the data for all sources at once , hence averaging out the velocity dependence .    in figure  [ fig:2cfig01 ] a scatter plot of @xmath7 versus @xmath37 for all sources",
    "is displayed .",
    "on these axes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the values of the @xmath8 at @xmath40 equal to 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "every data point represents one velocity channel .",
    "only points with @xmath41 s / n higher than 5 are plotted .",
    "the centre line is a least squares fit of equation  [ eqn:2comp ] to the data , yielding @xmath38 = 24 k and @xmath39 = 88 k. we can not explicitly solve for @xmath26 , only the factor @xmath42 .",
    "statistically , however , we expect an average value of @xmath28 = 0.5 , and assuming this we can solve for the cold component temperature .",
    "this gives @xmath1 = 76 k. varying @xmath28 gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the average cold component temperature .",
    "@xmath1 goes to 88 k and 64 k for @xmath28 equal to 0 and 1 respectively .    we interpret the scatter in the fit as being due to a range of @xmath1 and @xmath43 . in figure  [ fig:2cfig01 ]",
    "we show visually selected upper and lower envelopes with the form of equation  [ eqn:2comp ] ( solid lines ) . @xmath38",
    "ranges from 0 k to 60 k. points on the lower envelope , which has @xmath44 , thus represent regions where there is no warm component , and as we move toward the upper envelope , @xmath1 and @xmath39 increase . from the envelopes we find @xmath1 ranging between 50 k and @xmath45 k",
    "( the upper limit is for @xmath28 = 0.5 and the uncertainty comes from varying @xmath28 between 0 and 1 ) .",
    "there are a few scattered points below the lower envelope .",
    "we analyzed these points in more detail to see if they could be due to a very cold neutral hydrogen component ( below 40 k ) .",
    "we find that several well defined ( relatively unblended ) features contribute most of the points .",
    "table  [ tab : coldfea ] summarizes these features . selecting features with line centre @xmath3 below 40",
    "k yields the same list .",
    "the optical depth and spin temperature line profiles for these features are shown in figure  [ fig : coldbox ] . the last column in table  [ tab : coldfea ]",
    "shows the cold temperatures obtained by fitting our two - component model to each feature region individually ( for a @xmath28 = 0.5 ) .",
    "fitting individual features in this way is similar to the approach taken by @xcite , except that we fit two components instead of one , and the fitting is done by least squares rather than by eye .",
    "the cold temperatures are confirmed by the two - component model . except for the feature towards ( 85.089 , + 3.620 ) , which has a computed @xmath1 of only 4 k ( range of 0 k for @xmath46 to 13 k for @xmath47 ) ,",
    "all of the features have a @xmath1 of approximately 20 k , with a typical range between 10 k for @xmath46 and 30 k for @xmath47 .",
    "note that the velocities of these features place all of them quite far in the outer galaxy ( unfortunately making it unlikely that they show up as h  self - absorption ) .",
    "while the model envelopes ( figure  [ fig:2cfig01 ] ) fit the data reasonably well , we can clearly see that @xmath48 increases more rapidly at small @xmath36 and flattens out at a maximum value of approximately 120 k. this peak brightness temperature is a well known observational fact for spiral galaxies .",
    "we are probably seeing two effects here : first , because galactic rotation spreads out the gas in velocity , only a certain amount of gas ever piles up at the same velocity limiting the maximum brightness temperature @xcite .",
    "second , clearly if the optical depth in a line becomes much greater than 1 , it will start to saturate , which creates a non - linear dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath49 .",
    "these two effects would explain why a simple radiation transfer , as modeled , does not fit the upper envelope better .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig:2cfig01 ] shows a fit to the upper envelope below the `` break '' with @xmath38 = 25 k and @xmath39 = 212 k. for @xmath28 = 0.5 this gives a cold component temperature , @xmath1 = 200 k ( with a range from 188 k to 212 k for @xmath28 equal to 1 and 0 respectively ) .",
    "if saturation is a dominant effect at high optical depth , then this line reflects what the state of the unsaturated gas is . the much higher @xmath1 value obtained by this fit , compared to fitting the whole range of @xmath9 , is accounted for by the fact that the warmer the gas gets , the harder it is for it to reach high optical depth .",
    "@xcite , applied a similar model to data for 87 sources covering a large range of galactic latitude .",
    "they found best fit values of @xmath1 = 105 k and @xmath38 = 4 k , and envelope values from 54 k to 157 k for @xmath1 and from 2 k to 6 k for @xmath38 .",
    "the inconsistency between these and our results might arise primarily from the typically higher latitude of sources used in their study .",
    "we examined the radial variation of the temperature by fitting the two - component model to bins in galactocentric radius .",
    "we used the rotation curve from @xcite to compute the galactocentric radius corresponding to a given velocity , assuming a rotation velocity of 220 km / s for the local standard of rest , and 8.5 kpc galactic centre to sun distance . to find the radial variation of our model parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath38",
    ", we binned the data in 1 kpc intervals out to 16 kpc and beyond in 2 kpc intervals to 20 kpc .",
    "the bin sizes were chosen so that every bin contains a large enough number of points to apply our model .",
    "we fitted the data for each bin in the same way as the whole dataset in section  [ sec:2c ] , finding a best fit value and an upper and lower envelope .",
    "figure  [ fig:2cradvar ] shows the variation of @xmath1 and @xmath38 as a function of radius for @xmath28 = 0.5 .",
    "the dots show the fitted values , while the lines above and below indicate the temperature range given by the envelopes .",
    "the average cold component temperature rises from a local value of about 65 k to 80 k around 14 kpc and then drops off to 45 k in the outer galaxy .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by @xmath28 is a maximum of about 20 k for the inner bins , and drops to around 10 k in the outer bins ( r @xmath23 14 kpc ) .",
    "the lower envelope follows the same trend ranging from 40 k to 60 k , while the upper envelope depends only weakly on r ranging from 80 k to 100 k , with a minimum around 12 kpc and a peak at 14 kpc .",
    "@xmath38 starts out at a maximum value of 36 k , and also has a local peak around 14 kpc before falling off to about 10 k at 20 kpc .",
    "these results indicate that warm gas is rare in the outer galaxy .",
    "of course the variation in @xmath38 could be due to a combination of changing warm temperature and opacity .",
    "further , at 20 kpc a line of sight at latitude 5@xmath50 is 1.8 kpc above the plane , and the galactic warp could be as large as 4 kpc @xcite .",
    "especially the negative latitude lines of sight can thus look at quite a different height of the disk locally as compared to the far outer galaxy .",
    "this could affect our results ( our spin temperatures , however , do not indicate any dependence on @xmath51 ) .",
    "we have used the absorption and emission spectra to study the density of the h  gas . for a gas at temperature @xmath52 the element of column density in a velocity channel of width @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 and represents the number of atoms per @xmath55 in the velocity range @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath56 in km / s , the constant @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 @xmath60k@xmath61(km / s)@xmath61 .",
    "a spatial density as a function of galactocentric radius can be computed by dividing the line of sight into @xmath62 bins .",
    "the density , @xmath63 in any bin is given by , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the line of sight distance through the bin and @xmath66 is the corresponding velocity range computed from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nvsr ] shows the mean density as a function of galactocentric radius for all the sources .",
    "a robust exponential least - squares fit of the form @xmath67 to the distribution is shown , which characterizes the decrease quite well beyond 14 kpc , with values for @xmath68 @xmath2 and @xmath69 kpc@xmath61 .",
    "we can see a local increase in the density around 12 kpc , due to the perseus arm .",
    "we also examine the variation of density with height above the plane , @xmath51 .",
    "to derive a spatial density as a function of @xmath51 , @xmath70 , we sum the data in a given @xmath51 bin as in equation  [ eqn : nr ] , but now @xmath66 refers to the velocity range contributing to the bin and @xmath65 is the line of sight range , as before . in figure",
    "[ fig : nz ] we show the mean value of @xmath71 as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the mean of the density drops off with scale heights of approximately 350 and 280 pc above and below the plane respectively ( found from exponential fits to the positive and negative sides of the distribution ) .",
    "the difference is due to the galactic warp , which shows up as a density enhancement clearly visible at positive @xmath51 in figure  [ fig : nz ] .",
    "the scale heights correspond to a combination of the warm and cold components ( averaged over the cgps region ) .    in the absence of information on absorption ,",
    "h  mass is often inferred from emission line data .",
    "the question of the ability to trace h  gas by the emission alone is thus interesting to address . in deriving h  mass from emission the optically - thin case is assumed where equation  [ eqn : n ] reduces to @xmath72 where we have designated @xmath73 as the column density derived from emission alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : nvsn ] shows the emission column density , @xmath73 , versus the column density @xmath74 given by absorption using equation  [ eqn : n ] . by combining equation [ eqn : n ] with equation  [ eqn : nem ] we can find a functional relation between @xmath74 and @xmath73 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 . in reality",
    "many different spin temperatures contribute to each measured column density .",
    "however equation  [ eqn : nfit ] provides a convenient way to characterize the relationship between @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "by least squares fitting the parameter a , we find a value of @xmath77 @xmath60 ; the corresponding fit is shown in figure  [ fig : nvsn ] and well represents the data .",
    "the average ratio of @xmath78 is equal to 1.32 ( or @xmath73 = 75% of @xmath74 ) . at the highest column densities",
    "@xmath73 measures only about 65% of the true column .",
    "@xcite find typical values for @xmath74/@xmath73 of 1.4 to 1.6 in the inner galaxy.@xcite derived a somewhat lower value of 1.2 for @xmath78 .",
    "the difference is probably due to our concentration of lines of sight very close to the galactic plane , where the opacity is highest , so the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath73 is the largest on average . @xcite clearly show this dependence of @xmath78 on galactic latitude in their figure 5 , and their values close to the galactic plane qualitatively agree with the results presented here .",
    "another of the cgps data products are the reprocessed images from the fcrao outer galaxy survey of the @xmath79co j = 1 - 0 rotational transition at 2.6 mm @xcite .",
    "the survey has an angular resolution of 1.67 arc - minutes , and covers the same velocity range as the 21-cm dataset at the same spectral resolution .",
    "co is often used as a tracer for molecular hydrogen , as it exists in a similar physical environment . the accuracy with which it traces @xmath80 , however , is still a subject of frequent debate .",
    "while the presence of co correlates with @xmath80 or very cold atomic hydrogen , the reverse often does not seem to be the case ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies @xcite are finding clear evidence for h  below 30 k , where we expect most the hydrogen to be in molecular form .",
    "our own 2-component analysis reveals several absorption features below 40 k. to check for the co - existence of h  absorbing gas and molecular material we compared the h  absorption spectra to the co emission spectra towards the sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : cocorr ] shows the co emission brightness temperature versus the h  optical depth for the 134 sources which are in the fcrao survey area ( from galactic longitude 102@xmath81 to 143@xmath81 and all cgps latitudes ) .",
    "it is evident that overall there is no correlation between the co emission and h  absorption .",
    "the co noise level is @xmath82 k. there is a very clear lack of data points with co emission brightness temperature above the noise level at low h  optical depth .",
    "this , and visual inspection of the spectra , show that in most cases where we do see co emission , h  absorption is also present .",
    "we find about 60 clear matches between h  and co features , and for approximately 20 of these , @xmath49 goes to zero .",
    "many such features are only a few channels wide both in co and h  optical depth .",
    "figure  [ fig : cosamplespecs ] shows two sample features . the narrow feature in the left panel , illustrates a case in which @xmath49 goes to zero .",
    "the panel on the right displays two broad h  absorption lines , one of which shows a clear correlation with co emission .    of the two cold features listed in table  [ tab : coldfea ] for which we have co data , one ( 112.107,+2.362 ) has associated co emission . in general , however , there is no preference for low spin temperatures in h  channels with associated co. as noted earlier though , if a cloud has multiple temperature components , the spin temperature is a harmonic mean , and therefore , even if the cold - component temperature is very low , the apparent spin temperature does not necessarily have to be low .",
    "so , while there is no overall correspondence between the co and h  features , the association of over 60 features is interesting , and a good indication that at least some of the atomic hydrogen is at very low temperatures .",
    "we plan to pursue this by modeling the individual features and by obtaining more observations at higher spectral resolution and signal to noise to be able to better quantify our current results .",
    "the spatial density of absorption peaks is a simple tracer of cold ism structures .",
    "an absorption feature in general corresponds to one cloud , or more if several lines are blended .",
    "the feature density ( number of features per kpc ) is thus a lower limit to the cloud density .",
    "we have developed an automatic absorption feature identification routine that finds peaks in the @xmath41 spectra .",
    "such an identification is never completely unambiguous , as noise spikes have to be separated from real features .",
    "the criteria applied were chosen to agree with a visual inspection of the spectra .",
    "features have to be stronger than 3 sigma in @xmath41 to be identified . to determine the line of sight distance corresponding to a given radius interval we used the rotation curve from @xcite .",
    "mathematically for any radial bin the feature density is given by , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total number of sources contributing to any given bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : fear ] shows the density of features as a function of galactocentric radius for two optical depth cut - off levels .",
    "the solid histogram is for all features with @xmath85 , while the dashed histogram is for @xmath86 .",
    "the error bars indicate the standard deviation in the bin divided by the square - root of the number of sources contributing to each bin .",
    "we show an exponential least - squares fit to the distribution for @xmath85 which is given by 19.7e@xmath87 features / kpc , and which describes the distribution quite well .",
    "as the histogram for @xmath86 illustrates , higher optical depth features are clearly concentrated in the local and perseus arms and disappear entirely beyond 16 kpc .",
    "@xcite found the feature density for all peak values of @xmath9 to have an average value of about 0.42 @xmath88 0.08 kpc@xmath61 from r = 0 to 4.25 kpc and 0.8 @xmath88 0.1 from r = 4.25 kpc to 8.5 kpc which agrees with our results .",
    "the feature density thus seems to reach a peak around the solar neighbourhood and decreases both in the inner and outer galaxy .",
    "we have to keep in mind though that as the line of sight distance increases , a given change in velocity becomes a larger and larger change in line of sight distance due to the rotation curve .",
    "while 1.32 km / s ( our spectral resolution ) locally corresponds to about 200 to 300 pc ( using the rotation curve to convert from velocity to distance ) , at -100 km / s the same velocity corresponds to scales from 200 pc to a few kpc ( depending on longitude ) .",
    "thus , if the dominant scale of structure in the h  is on the order of a 100 pc rather than several hundred parsecs to kiloparsecs , then this observed radial dependence could at least partially be an observational effect .",
    "as we look further and further away along the line of sight , we lose clouds in our identification due to the decreasing spatial resolution . in the outer galaxy ,",
    "an increase in the line of sight distance always corresponds to an increase in galactocentric radius .",
    "thus , since our data is largely in the outer galaxy , the observed effect will give a drop in the number of features .",
    "we have presented a new emission - absorption survey of the galactic plane at 21-cm with an unprecedented source density of about 0.6 sources per square degree . in agreement with previous studies we find spin temperatures between 40 k and 300 k. due to the difficulty in interpreting the spin temperature we apply a simple 2-component model to the data .",
    "we find @xmath1 and @xmath89 ranging from approximately 50 k to 80 k , and 0 k to 60 k respectively .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath89 show a peak at about 14 kpc and a decrease in the outer galaxy .",
    "the derived density of neutral atomic hydrogen varies roughly as e@xmath90 , with galactocentric radius ( in kpc ) . however directly interpreting this as a drop in gas density with radius is complicated by the presence of the galactic warp and the changing scale height visible in the @xmath51 profile of n. comparing the column density traced by emission to the total column we find that on average the emission traces about 75% of the total h  mass , and at the highest optical depths only about 65% .",
    "we looked for evidence of very cold hydrogen in the galaxy in our two - component model results and the spin temperature .",
    "this yielded a list of 5 features , with @xmath91 k and lying below the two - component model lower envelope . further a comparison to co shows that even though there is no overall correlation between co emission and h  absorption , about half the spectra show at least one h  absorption feature with clearly associated co emission .",
    "this study is a first look at the h  absorption in the cgps .",
    "we hope to continue this analysis by incorporating the southern and the vla galactic plane surveys @xcite , giving us more information on the inner galaxy , and the difference between the southern and northern parts of the galactic plane .",
    "while the 2-component model applied here gives us some interesting results , it is clear that a more detailed feature by feature analysis could reveal much new information .",
    "this will also be pursued further .",
