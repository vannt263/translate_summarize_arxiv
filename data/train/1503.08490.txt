    "state estimation has long been an essential component of electric power system monitoring and control systems  @xcite . in transmission systems",
    "it is typically based on near - real time measurements of voltages , power flows , and more recently , voltage phasors . in low- and medium - voltage distribution systems",
    "it is , however , often based on predicted loads in lack of a dedicated communication infrastructure and measurement devices  @xcite . due to the proliferation of volatile distributed renewable generation ( _ e.g. , _ residential pv systems ) , predicted loads will soon no longer be sufficient to achieve a good enough state estimate that would allow efficient and safe operation of the distribution grid , _",
    "e.g. , _ voltage conservation and var  control ( vvc ) , or fault location , isolation and restoration ( flir ) , and real - time measurements will therefore become necessary .",
    "while a dedicated real - time monitoring infrastructure for distribution grids may be too expensive , automated and smart meters , which are being deployed world - wide for billing purposes , could be used for providing the operators frequent measurements of the loads , thereby enabling dynamic state estimation . nonetheless , collecting frequent measurement data about residential or industrial customers loads",
    "can be used to invade the customers privacy in a variety of ways  @xcite .    to protect customers privacy but",
    "at the same time allow frequent smart meter measurements for system operation , a number of privacy - preserving aggregation schemes have been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "aggregation can be done via a trusted third party  @xcite or by using cryptographic solutions such as homomorphic encryption  @xcite , but these solutions increase system complexity significantly .",
    "an alternative aggregation scheme that does not increase system complexity relies on adding random noise , typically gaussian or laplacian , to the measurement data submitted by the customers .",
    "combined with careful protocol design , aggregation with random noise has been shown to provide differential privacy  @xcite , a probabilistic notion of privacy that is widely used in statistical databases  @xcite and has recently found application in filtering and control  @xcite . while adding noise may help preserve privacy , a fundamental question is how it would affect the quality of state estimation , and ultimately the power system applications that rely on it .    in this paper , we address this question by providing a characterization of the trade - off between differential privacy and the mean distortion of the state estimate in a single feeder of a distribution network based on load measurements from smart meters .",
    "we characterize the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-differential privacy under laplacian and gaussian additive random noise , respectively .",
    "we express the maximum a  posteriori state estimate as the solution of a convex programming problem , and provide a closed - form expression for the linear minimum mean square error estimate .",
    "we show that a customer by adding random noise may only have to give up a little bit extra of privacy , and can still dramatically improve the state estimation performance , which could enable optimizing financial incentives for trading estimation performance and customer privacy .",
    "the trade - off between privacy and estimation quality has been considered for inter - area state estimation in  @xcite , where the trade - off between the mutual information and the expected distortion was investigated in an information - theoretic framework .",
    "the authors in  @xcite studied the trade - off between the distortion of the estimate of a random variable modeling an electric load and the information leakage quantified by the mutual information . instead of mutual information , in this paper",
    "we use differential privacy , which allows us to evaluate privacy when different users data are non - stationary , and even without a statistical model of the data . in  @xcite , the authors study the differential privacy of the inputs to a dynamical system when releasing the outputs to a potential adversary , and design a differentially private kalman filter that protects the input variables . in this paper ,",
    "the setup is somewhat similar but we do not consider a dynamical system and we do analyze the case when the filter has access to side information , beyond the control of the inputs . in  @xcite , the authors evaluate the cost of differential privacy in a system of agents that try to estimate their environment in a distributed manner . in our work ,",
    "the estimation is done by a central entity instead of the agents themselves .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes our model and the problem formulation .",
    "section  [ sec : diffpriv ] defines differential privacy in the context of state estimation .",
    "section  [ sec : statest ] provides optimal state estimation algorithms under various assumptions and bounds on their accuracy .",
    "section  [ sec : tradeoff ] analyzes the trade - off between privacy and estimation error , and section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "operators of low- and medium - voltage power distribution networks today typically only have access to a relatively small number of real - time measurements @xcite .",
    "it is then not possible to run standard state estimation algorithms as is commonly used in high - voltage transmission grids @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we therefore analyze how low - level measurements of the customers loads can be integrated in state estimation schemes , while ensuring the customers privacy .",
    "we consider a single distribution line that is connected to a substation under the control of an operator , see fig .",
    "[ fig : powerline ] .",
    "since distribution grids are typically radial , this is not a severe restriction .",
    "there are @xmath2 service drops or laterals along the line ; at each service drop location @xmath3 along the line , there are several loads connected in parallel , which draw a total load current @xmath4",
    ". we will here investigate the `` value '' of a measurement of @xmath4 to the operator .",
    "such a measurement could be realized in a modern distribution power grid by using individual customers smart meters .",
    "for example , the individual customers at location @xmath3 could aggregate their measurements and send them directly to the operator , in real time",
    ". however , for privacy reasons , it may not be desirable for an individual customer to share its instantaneous load .",
    "we denote such a customer by @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerline ] , and will next investigate how the customer can contribute with measurements and still maintain a quantifiable amount of privacy .",
    "it is not necessary to have a trusted agent at location @xmath3 to perform the aggregation of the measured load currents , to form the measurement of @xmath4 . in  @xcite , it is shown how such computations can be securely decentralized among the customers .     at the substation .",
    "we analyze how the operator can benefit in the state estimation from communicated measurements of the loads @xmath6 , while maintaining individual customers privacy ( customer denoted by @xmath5 ) . ]      in what we call the _ base scenario _ , the operator has only access to a real - time measurement @xmath7 of the total current flow @xmath8 that is being supplied from the substation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is zero - mean gaussian measurement noise , of variance @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the standard deviation ) . in the base scenario , we also assume the operator has access to a statistical model of the loads @xmath13 along the line . in the power systems literature , sometimes such data are referred to as _ pseudo measurements_. the load vector @xmath14 is assumed to have a multivariate gaussian distribution , @xmath15 , with mean and covariance denoted by @xmath16 }   = \\begin{pmatrix } { \\mathbf{e}[l_1 ] } \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ { \\mathbf{e}[l_n ] } \\end{pmatrix }   \\\\ p & = \\begin{pmatrix }   p_{11 } & \\ldots &   p_{1n } \\\\",

    "[ fig : powerline ] .",
    "the operator could estimate this statistical model based on historical load data .",
    "the following notation will also be used , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is column vector of ones .    in this paper , the sole physical model used is based on the _ conservation of currents _ , _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 are the ( unknown ) currents along the line .",
    "it is clear that the operator may benefit from a more detailed physical model in the state estimation to follow , but we leave this option for future work .",
    "note that flow conservation models similar to apply to other distribution networks , such as gas and water networks , where mass is a conserved quantity .",
    "hence , the results that follow are applicable also in these scenarios .    based on the model",
    ", it follows that the total current @xmath8 has a gaussian distribution , @xmath21 , where @xmath22    in what we call the _ smart meter scenario _ , the operator is also provided real - time measurements @xmath23 of the loads @xmath6 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are independent zero - mean random noise variables with laplacian distributions of variance @xmath26 .",
    "( the probability density function ( pdf ) of a zero - mean laplacian random variable @xmath27 is @xmath28 . )",
    "the reason for the laplacian noise assumption will become clear in section  [ sec : diffpriv ] .      based on the measurement @xmath7 and the statistical model of @xmath14 , it is possible for the operator in the base scenario to estimate the loads @xmath29 and currents @xmath30 along the line , see section  [ sec : statest ] . with such estimates , one can monitor the status of the line and detect faults in real time .",
    "however , when the load uncertainty is large ( the covariance @xmath31 is large ) , the quality of this estimate is low .",
    "the main problem considered in this paper is how to integrate the load measurements @xmath32 in the state estimation in the smart meter scenario , and to quantify the improvement of the estimate and the _ loss of privacy _ that the customers experience .",
    "in this section , the goal is to quantify the loss of privacy that the customers along the distribution line experience through the introduction of the load measurements @xmath33 .      to quantify the level of privacy enjoyed by the customers along the line ,",
    "we employ the notion of _ differential privacy _ , see  @xcite , for example .",
    "we first need to introduce some concepts : suppose that data from @xmath34 customers are stored in a vector @xmath35 .",
    "we call the vector @xmath36 a _ data vector_. we say two data vectors @xmath37 are _ adjacent _ , @xmath38 , if and only if they differ in one entry : @xmath39 a concrete example is that one customer turns off his smart meter and does not participate in the data collection , transforming @xmath36 into @xmath40 .",
    "we also note that adj@xmath41 is a symmetric binary relation .",
    "we say a measurement @xmath42 , where @xmath27 is a random variable , is @xmath1-_differentially private _ if for all adjacent data vectors @xmath37 , and possible events @xmath43 , it holds @xmath44 \\leq e^\\epsilon \\",

    "\\label{eq : diffpriv}\\ ] ] if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are small , this means that the changes in the statistics of the output of @xmath47 are very small when applied to any adjacent data vectors .",
    "put differently , with access to only the output of @xmath47 , it is practically impossible to decide whether a single customer has participated in the measurement , or not , and @xmath1 provides a quantitative certificate of privacy to the customer .",
    "if holds with @xmath48 , we say @xmath47 is @xmath0-_differentially private_. more details on the interpretation of differential privacy can be found in @xcite , for example .    to design @xmath1-differentially private measurements @xmath47 , we use theorems  2 and 3 in @xcite .",
    "first , we suppose the measurements can be written in the general form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a deterministic _ query _ that depends on the data vector only .",
    "next , define the _ sensitivity _ of a query @xmath51 by @xmath52 that is , @xmath53 measures the worst - case change in output of @xmath54 over adjacent data vectors @xmath36 .",
    "the following proposition then holds .",
    "the measurement @xmath55 is :    * @xmath0-differentially private if the random variable @xmath27 has a laplace distribution , @xmath56 , with zero mean and scale parameter @xmath57 ; * @xmath1-differentially private if the random variable @xmath27 has a gaussian distribution , @xmath58 , with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "[ prop : lapgauss ]    hence , by either adding laplacian noise or gaussian noise to a query we obtain differential privacy .",
    "note that laplacian noise yields better privacy ( @xmath48 ) because its pdf has fatter tails .",
    "thus if customers can choose to add noise , laplacian noise is the natural selection and justifies the model  .",
    "the noise in is modeled as being gaussian , because we assume it arises in the physical meter owned by the operator .",
    "there is of course also similar physical noise in the customers smart meters , but for simplicity we assume this is negligible . in any case , introducing more noise sources in the customers measurements would only increase their privacy .      by providing measurements of the loads @xmath4 ,",
    "it is clear that the customers will loose some privacy .",
    "however , the operator can already measure the total current @xmath8 by means of , beyond the control of the customers .",
    "we should first therefore evaluate the loss of privacy through this measurement .",
    "because @xmath7 is subjected to gaussian noise , we use proposition  [ prop : lapgauss]-(b ) .",

    "an adjacent load pattern is obtained if a single customer @xmath5 at an arbitrary location @xmath3 changes his or her load , so that the load goes from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . if we assume a ( uniform ) bound on the difference between the maximum and minimum load current of a single customer",

    "we note that the @xmath77-term in lemma  [ lem : eps0 ] can be neglected if the customer size @xmath66 is small as compared to @xmath78 , and then @xmath79 .",
    "note that differential privacy is independent of the underlying probability distribution of the load pattern @xmath14 ( the data ) .",
    "hence , no matter if it is really gaussian , or not , the level of privacy is guaranteed .",
    "the statistical model of the data is needed for reliable state estimation , however .",
    "in the smart meter scenario , the customers provide the measurements @xmath23 , @xmath80 to the operator , which causes a loss of privacy compared to the base scenario . in this case , the queries are of the type @xmath81 , where @xmath64 is a realization of @xmath4 . under the same assumptions as in the previous subsection , we have that @xmath82 where @xmath66 is the uniform bound on a single customer s maximum load current change .",

    "<S> state estimation is routinely being performed in high - voltage power transmission grids in order to assist in operation and to detect faulty equipment . in low- and medium - voltage power distribution grids , on the other hand , few real - time measurements are traditionally available , and operation is often conducted based on predicted and historical data . today , in many parts of the world , smart meters have been deployed at many customers , and their measurements could in principle be shared with the operators in real time to enable improved state estimation . </S>",
    "<S> however , customers may feel reluctance in doing so due to privacy concerns . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose state estimation schemes for a distribution grid model , which ensure differential privacy to the customers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the state estimation schemes optimize different performance criteria , and a trade - off between a lower bound on the estimation performance versus the customers differential privacy is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed framework is general enough to be applicable also to other distribution networks , such as water and gas networks . </S>"
