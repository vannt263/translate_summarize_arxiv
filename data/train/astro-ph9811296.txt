    "despite much effort the origin of the diffuse galactic continuum @xmath0-ray  emission is still subject to considerable uncertainties .",
    "while the main @xmath0-ray  production mechanisms are agreed to be inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , @xmath2-production , and bremsstrahlung , their individual contributions depend on many details such as interstellar electron and nucleon spectra , interstellar radiation and magnetic fields , gas distribution etc . at energies above @xmath3 gev and below @xmath4 mev the dominant physical mechanisms are yet to be established ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , moskalenko , strong , & reimer 1998 , hereafter @xcite , moskalenko & strong 1999a , hereafter @xcite ) .    the spectrum of galactic @xmath0-rays  as measured by egret shows enhanced emission above 1 gev in comparison with calculations based on locally measured proton and electron spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "mori ( 1997 ) and gralewicz et al .  ( 1997 ) proposed a harder interstellar proton spectrum as a solution .",
    "this possibility has been tested using cosmic - ray antiprotons and positrons ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another explanation has been proposed by porter & protheroe ( 1997 ) and pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) , who suggested that the average interstellar electron spectrum can be harder than that locally observed due to the spatially inhomogeneous source distribution and energy losses .",
    "pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) made detailed monte carlo simulations of the high - energy electron spectrum in the galaxy taking into account the spatially inhomogeneous source distribution , and showed that the @xmath0-ray  excess could indeed be explained in terms of inverse compton emission from a hard electron spectrum .",
    "the situation below several mev is also unclear ; skibo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that the diffuse flux measured by osse below 1 mev ( @xcite ) can be explained by bremsstrahlung only if there is a steep upturn in the electron spectrum at low energies , but that this requires very large energy input into the interstellar medium .",
    "a model for the acceleration of low - energy electrons has been proposed by schlickeiser ( 1997 ) .",
    "an analysis of the emission in the 130 mev range , based on the latest comptel data , has been made by @xcite , who found that the predicted intensities are significantly below the observations , and that a point - source component is probably necessary .",
    "solving these puzzles requires a systematic study including all relevant astrophysical data and a corresponding self - consistent approach to be adopted .    with this motivation a numerical method and corresponding",

    "the green s functions for the propagation of positrons from dark - matter particle annihilations in the galactic halo have been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the rationale for our approach was given previously ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , the idea is to develop a model which simultaneously reproduces observational data of many kinds related to cosmic - ray origin and propagation : directly via measurements of nuclei , electrons , and positrons , indirectly via @xmath0-rays  and synchrotron radiation .",
    "these data provide many independent constraints on any model and our approach is able to take advantage of this since it aims to be consistent with many types of observation .",
    "we emphasize also the use of realistic astrophysical input ( e.g.  for the gas distribution ) as well as theoretical developments ( e.g.reacceleration ) .",
    "the code is sufficiently general that new physical effects can be introduced as required .",
    "we aim for a ` standard model ' which can be improved with new astrophysical input and additional observational constraints .    comparing our approach with the model for egret data by hunter et al.(1997 ) , which used a spiral - arm model with cosmic - ray / gas coupling , we concentrate less on obtaining an exact fit to the angular distribution of @xmath0-rays  and more on the relation to cosmic - ray propagation theory and data .    with this paper",

    "the ` hard spectrum ' models are chosen so that the calculated @xmath0-ray  spectrum matches the @xmath0-ray  egret data .      since mathis , mezger , & panagia ( 1983 ) , bloemen ( 1985 ) ,",

    "the modelling of propagation can however simply be seen as a way to obtain a physically motivated set of particle spectra to be tested against @xmath0-ray  and other observations ; in the end we test just the ambient electron and nucleon spectra against the data , independent of the physical nature of their origin . in this sense",
    "our investigation does not depend on the details of the propagation models but still retains the constraints imposed by antiproton and positron data .",
    "observations of synchrotron intensity and spectral index provide essential and stringent constraints on the interstellar electron spectrum and on our magnetic field model . for this reason",

    "in fact our models require an injection @xmath45 to compensate the steepening and give reasonable agreement with the observed @xmath46 .",

    "the comparison with models also depends on the @xmath9-distribution of the magnetic field , since this affects how the spectral index is weighted with @xmath9 , and will give larger indices for larger extents of @xmath47 due the spectral steepening with @xmath9 .",

    "such tests are therefore well tuned , and sample the galactic - scale properties of cr @xmath10 and he rather than just the local region , independent of fluctuations due to local primary cr sources .    the conclusion of @xcite , based on the @xmath67 ratio as measured by hof et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , was that antiprotons provide a sensitive test of the interstellar nucleon spectra , and that a hard nucleon spectrum overproduces @xmath63 s at gev energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig_antiprotons ] the predicted flux of antiprotons is compared with new _ absolute _",
    "@xmath63 fluxes above 3 gev from the mass91 experiment ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the agreement is good for the normal nucleon spectrum , the hard nucleon spectrum produces too many antiprotons by a factor of @xmath68 , well outside the error bars of the three data points .",
    "we conclude that such a hard nucleon spectrum is inconsistent with the antiproton data .",
    "[ fig_positrons ] shows the interstellar positron spectrum for the conventional and hard nucleon spectra , where we used the formalism given in @xcite .",
    "the flux for the conventional case agrees with recent data ( @xcite ) at high energies , where solar modulation is not so important . for the hard nucleon spectrum",
    "the flux is higher than observed by factor @xmath304 ; this provides more evidence against a hard nucleon spectrum .",
    "however this test is less direct than @xmath63 due to the difference in particle type , the large effect of energy losses , and the effect of solar modulation at lower positron energies .    taken together ,",
    "the antiproton and positron data provide rather substantial evidence against the idea of explaining the @xmath691 gev @xmath0-ray  excess with a hard nucleon spectrum .",
    "note that in these tests we assume that only the protons have a local spectrum which is different from that on galactic scales .",
    "we assume that the propagation parameters can still be derived from b / c , so that implicitly the heavier nuclei c , o are not affected .",
    "we could alternatively adopt a picture in which the c , o etc .  also have a local spectrum different from galactic scales , but then fitting the b / c ratio would imply @xmath70 for the index in the diffusion coefficient ( nonreacceleration case ) which is certainly problematic for high - energy anisotropy ( see @xcite and references therein ) and larger than predicted by standard diffusion theory .",
    "therefore we consider the only case worth testing at this stage is the one where only the protons are affected . in any case ,",
    "pursuit of more complex options is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an obvious way to improve the fit to the egret data above 1 gev is to adopt a harder interstellar electron injection spectrum .",
    "such models will _ not _ match the directly - observed electron spectrum above 10 gev , but this is not critical since the large energy losses in this region mean that large spatial fluctuations are expected ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence we relax the constraint of consistency with the locally measured electron spectrum .",
    "for the he model we adjust the electron injection index and the absolute electron flux to optimize the fit to the inner - galaxy @xmath0-ray  spectrum ; also the absolute nucleon intensity ( @xmath2-component ) was reduced slightly ( factor 0.8 ) within the limits allowed by the proton and helium data . the inner - galaxy @xmath0-ray  spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma_spectrum_he ] . this model with its harder electron injection index ( @xmath71 )",
    "satisfies the synchrotron constraints and also leads to a better fit to the @xmath0-rays  above 1 gev , but produces too few @xmath0-rays  at energies below 30 mev by a factor 24 . in this case",
    "the additional low energy @xmath0-rays  must be attributed to another component as discussed in section  [ se ] in the context of se model .",
    "pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) use an electron injection index 2.0 with a gaussian distribution of 0.2 for their @xmath0-ray  model .",
    "this has the effect of an upwards curvature which is equivalent to a harder spectrum similar to ours .",
    "quantitatively , from their fig .  4",
    ", the difference in effective index for their spiral arm model going from a single index to the index with dispersion gives in fact a difference 0.2 at high energies .",
    "so the dispersed index is equivalent to a single index , 2.00.2 = 1.8 , which is similar to our 1.7 ( he model ) .",
    "since the fit of he model to the egret detailed spectral shape is still not very good above 1 gev we can ask whether it can be improved by allowing more freedom in the nucleon spectrum also ( model hemn ) .",
    "some freedom is allowed since solar modulation affects direct measurements of nucleons below 20 gev , and the locally measured nucleon spectrum may not necessarily be representative of the average on galactic scales either in spectrum or intensity due to details of galactic structure ( e.g.  spiral arms ) . because of the hard electron spectrum the required modification to the nucleon spectrum is much less drastic than in model hn . by introducing an _ ad hoc",
    "_ flattening of the nucleon spectrum below 20 gev , a small steepening above 20 gev , and a suitable normalization , an improved match to the inner galaxy egret spectrum is indeed possible ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma_spectrum_hemn ] ) .",
    "the spectral parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "for the modified nucleon spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig_protons ] ) we must invoke departures from cylindrical symmetry so that the local value still agrees with direct measurements at the solar position .",
    "however this modification of the nucleon spectrum must be checked against the stringent constraints on the _ interstellar _ spectrum provided by antiprotons and positrons ( as in model hn ) .",
    "the predictions of this model are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_antiprotons ] and [ fig_positrons ] .",
    "as expected the predictions are larger than the conventional model but still within the antiproton and positron limits .",
    "so far this is the most promising model ( at least for @xmath0-rays  @xmath6930 mev ) and hence we consider it further by testing the angular distribution of the emission .",
    "the synchrotron predictions for this model and comparison with data were presented in section  [ synch_emis ] .",
    "[ fig_gamma_latitude_profile ] and [ fig_gamma_longitude_profile ] show the hemn model latitude and longitude @xmath0-ray  distributions convolved with the egret point - spread function , compared to egret phase 14 data .",
    "the separate components are also shown .",
    "since the isotropic component is here regarded as a free parameter it was adjusted in each energy range to give agreement with the high - latitude intensities in the latitude plots , and the same value was used in the longitude plots .    in latitude",
    "the agreement is always quite good , in longitude the maximum deviation is about 25% in the 100150 mev , 150300 mev , and 410 mev ranges , typically the agreement is better than 10% .",
    "we believe , this is satisfactory for a model which has not been optimized for the spatial fit in each energy range , but anyway these figures allow the reader to judge for himself . in any case , it should be remembered that unresolved point - source components and irregularities in the cosmic - ray source distribution are expected to lead to deviations from our cylindrically symmetrical model at some level .",
    "in this model the contributions to the spectrum of the inner galaxy from ic and @xmath2-decay are about equal at 100 mev and 6 gev , @xmath2-decay dominates between these energies , and bremsstrahlung produces @xmath7210% of the total .",
    "the comparison shows that a model with large ic component can indeed reproduce the data . a profile for 70100 mev enlarged to illustrate the high - latitude variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma_high_latitude_profile ] ) shows that this model also accounts very well for the observed emission ; we regard this as support for the large ic halo concept .    turning to high energies ,",
    "consider the latitude and longitude profiles for 400010000 mev ; the agreement shows that the adoption of a hard electron injection spectrum is a viable explanation for the @xmath691 gev excess .",
    "the latitude distribution here is not as wide as at low energies owing to the rapid energy losses of the electrons ; both hn and hemn models reproduce the observed spectrum , and latitude and longitude profiles almost equally well ( @xcite ) , and hence it is difficult to discriminate between them on the basis of @xmath0-rays  alone .",
    "independent tests however argue against hn as described in section  [ hn ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that in fitting egret data strong & mattox ( 1996 ) found that the ic component had a harder spectrum than expected ( see their fig .  4 ) , which was quite puzzling at that time .",
    "also the study of chen , dwyer , & kaaret ( 1996 ) at high latitudes found a hard ic component .",
    "these results can now be understood in the context of the he or hemn model ; a renewed application of the fitting approach with the new models would be worthwhile and is intended for the future .",
    "all these results can be taken as adding support to the ` hard electron spectrum ' interpretation of the @xmath0-ray  results , and for the idea that the average interstellar electron spectrum is harder than that measured in the heliosphere .",
    "if this model is indeed correct it then implies that bremsstrahlung plays a rather minor rle at all energies , contrary to previous ideas , with ic and @xmath2-decay accounting for @xmath3090% of the diffuse emission .",
    "although we have introduced rather arbitrary modifications to both electron and nucleon spectra to better fit the @xmath0-ray  data , we note two recent indications that add support to our approach from independent studies .",
    "baring et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently presented models for shock acceleration in snr which produce very flat electron spectra quite similar to what we require in the present case .",
    "further study of the possible link between these spectra is in progress .",
    "a completely independent line of evidence for a low - energy flattening of the proton spectrum has recently been presented by lemoine , vangioni - flam , & cass ( 1998 ) , based on cosmic - ray produced light element abundances .",
    "if the proton and he spectra do differ from that locally measured , this could of course also apply other primaries , but an investigation of this is beyond the scope of the present work , which focusses on @xmath0-rays .      in order to reproduce the low - energy ( @xmath1 30 mev ) @xmath0-ray  emission via diffuse processes it is necessary to invoke steepening of the electron spectrum below about 200 mev to compensate the increasing ionization losses",
    ". a steep slope continuing to higher energies would violate the synchrotron constraints on the spectral index , as discussed in section  [ gray_data ] .",
    "for illustration we show a non - reacceleration model with an injection index 3.2 below 200 mev , and 1.8 above ( se model ) .",
    "this fits both the comptel and egret data ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma_spectrum_se ] ) while remaining consistent with the synchrotron constraints ( fig .  [ fig_sync_index ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron index increase occurs at frequencies @xmath73 mhz , below the range where useful limits can be set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the behaviour of the electron diffusion coefficient at energies below 100 mev is quite uncertain ( @xcite ) the propagated spectrum is here dominated by energy losses , which severely limit the electron range , so that this is not critical for our model .    in this model 70% of the emission",
    "is bremsstrahlung and 30% ic at 1 mev .",
    "this is the only model in the present work which can reproduce the entire @xmath0-ray  spectrum .",
    "a possible mechanism for acceleration of low - energy electrons has been proposed by schlickeiser ( 1997 ) .",
    "however the adoption of such a steep low - energy electron spectrum has problems associated with the very large power input to the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) , and is _ ad hoc _ with no independent supporting evidence .",
    "moreover the osse - ginga @xmath0-ray  spectrum is steeper than @xmath55 below 500 kev ( @xcite ) which would require an even steeper electron injection spectrum than adopted here .",
    "it is more natural to consider that the comptel excess is just a continuation of the same component producing the osse - ginga spectrum .",
    "most probably therefore the excess emission at low energies is produced by a population of sources such as supernova remnants , as has been proposed for the diffuse hard x - ray emission from the plane observed by rxte ( @xcite ) , or x - ray transients in their low state as suggested for the osse diffuse hard x - rays ( @xcite ) .",

    ".    a model with a constant electron injection index 2.4 can also fit the low - energy @xmath0-rays , but conflicts with the synchrotron index and fails to reproduce the high - energy @xmath0-rays .",

    "so far some 90 extragalactic sources have been observed with the egret telescope and several with comptel ( e.g. , @xcite , 1999 ) .",
    "most of these sources are blazars .",
    "such data usually serve as a basis for estimates of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray  background radiation . however , the number of normal galaxies far exceeds that of active galaxies , it is therefore interesting to calculate the total diffuse continuum emission of our galaxy as an example . using cosmological evolution scenarios , this can then be used as the basis for estimates of the contribution from normal galaxies to the extragalactic background .    the luminosity spectrum of the diffuse emission from the galaxy is shown in fig .",

    "we have carried out a new study of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray  continuum radiation using a cosmic - ray propagation model including nucleons , electrons , antiprotons , positrons , and synchrotron emission .",
    "we have shown that ` conventional ' models based on locally measured cosmic - ray spectra are consistent with @xmath0-ray  measurements in the 30500 mev range , but outside this range excesses are apparent .",
    "a harder nucleon spectrum alone is considered but fitting to @xmath0-rays  causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons .",
    "a harder interstellar electron spectrum allows the @xmath0-ray  spectrum to be fitted also above 1 gev , and this can be further improved when combined with a modified nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and positrons .",
    "this is our preferred model , and it matches the egret @xmath0-ray  longitude and latitude profiles reasonably in each energy band .",
    "such a model produces only 2550% of the 130 mev emission by diffuse processes .",
    "the constraints provided by the synchrotron spectral index do not allow all of the @xmath130 mev @xmath0-ray  emission to be explained in terms of a steep electron spectrum unless this takes the form of a sharp upturn below 200 mev .",
    "therefore we prefer a source population as the origin of the excess low - energy @xmath0-rays , which can then be seen as an extention of the hard x - ray continuum measured by osse , ginga and rxte .",
    "this is a quite natural scenario since it is very likely that the hard x - rays are indeed from unresolved sources , and the switchover from source - dominated to diffuse - dominated has to occur at some point ; we propose here that it occurs at mev energies .",
    "the large electron / ic halo suggested here reproduces well the high - latitude variation of @xmath0-ray  emission , which can be taken as support for the halo size for nucleons deduced from independent studies of cosmic - ray composition .",
    "halo sizes in the range @xmath84 kpc are favoured by both analyses .",
    "our models suggest that bremsstrahlung plays a rather minor rle , producing not more than @xmath3010% of the galactic emission at any energy .",
    "a part of this work was performed while ivm held a national research council / nasa gsfc senior research associateship .",
    "in order to calculate the electron bremsstrahlung spectrum in the interstellar medium , which includes neutral gas ( hydrogen and helium ) , hydrogen - like and helium - like ions as well as the fully ionized medium , we use the works of koch & motz ( 1959 ) , gould ( 1969 ) , and blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) .",
    "our approach is similar to that used by sacher & schnfelder ( 1984 ) , but differs in some details . throughout this section",
