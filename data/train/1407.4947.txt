    "independent control of the reflected - polarization beam s position and time delay is achieved using the two orthogonal translation stages on one path of the interferometer .",

    "quarter - wave plates before and after the glass are used to convert the pulses to orthogonal circular polarizations and then back to linear polarizations so that the pump beam can be imaged separately from the signal by use of a polarizer . by varying the waveplates and translation stages , we access a parameter space of total power , relative angle , and relative power .",
    "no interactions are observed for relative delays of more than about 300 fs . in order to control for possible interactions with a weak background and",
    "slow or nonlocal effects we chose to measure the interactions by varying the delay rather than simply blocking either of the beams , as was done in the simulations .",
    "a diagram of the apparatus is shown in supplementary figure 1 .",
    "* simulations * we were guided initially by two - dimensional simulations , which were observed to match experiment qualitatively along the plane containing the angle between the beams .",
    "the simulations involved a split - step fourier solution of the three - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation for each polarization .",
    "the coupled nonlinear step used a 4th - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the fields were chosen to initially have flat radial and spectral phases , were 320 fs ( fwhm ) by 200 @xmath4 m ( @xmath5 intensity ) and were initially overlapped . parameters for sf11 were n=1.76 , @xmath6 fs@xmath7/cm , and n@xmath8=41@xmath9 @xmath4m@xmath7/w . for 3d simulations ,",
    "the grid was 128 time points by 256 space points with a 750 @xmath4 m step in the propagation direction .",

    "the pulse duration was shortened to 150 fs .",
    "this leads to a simpler , more identifiably cone - shaped wave which typifies the general form of post - collapse waves and is more suitable for an explanatory figure of the general concept . for figure 1c , parameters mentioned above were used , in order to demonstrate the effect of linear regeneration on the pulses in the experiment and simulated gates .",
    "to provide an approximate measure to allow us to compare different computational platforms , we will consider the number of logical states of a set of @xmath1 logic gates , which are each comprised of several transistors .",
    "of course , we can not fully calculate the performance of each platform without making more detailed assumptions about the programming , the rate of error , power consumption , clock speed , etc .",
    "in addition to different levels of connectivity and flexibility , different platforms offer different advantages at the software and hardware levels .",
    "novel platforms provide an opportunity for new advances in these areas while necessarily eschewing many well - developed technologies and paradigms .    in conventional platforms , computation and",
    "interconnection takes place on a two - dimensional plane and gates are connected to their nearest neighbours by wires of finite size and fixed location .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that there are 8 input wires to each gate .",

    "this factor of @xmath15 applies , within our assumptions , equally to all architectures . for a 3d wired architecture",
    ", there are 18 additional neighbours to each gate ( again , assuming @xmath16 and @xmath17 wires ) , for a total of 26 inputs . similarly to the 2d wired architecture , there are @xmath18 states for @xmath1 gates in @xmath13 cycles .    for the globally - interconnected , wireless 3d architecture , each gate is directly connected to ( up to ) all @xmath1 other gates .",
    "all space between gates can be used , simultaneously by all signals , to connect to other gates .",
    "the number of states in @xmath13 cycles is @xmath19 . for a cutting - edge modern microprocessor transistor count of  @xmath20 ,",
    "the number of states for the assumed 2d architecture is about @xmath21 . for the 3d , globally - interconnected wireless architecture , the requisite @xmath1 to match",
    "this is about @xmath22 .",
    "hence , a set of about @xmath22 gates can be compared to @xmath23 in the conventional architecture .",
    "more importantly for future applications , a chip with @xmath23 gates may be comparable to a set of @xmath24 in a conventional one .",
    "this factor of improvement corresponds to a boost in computational capacity similar to that which has been obtained since gordon e. moore first predicted the exponential growth of integrated circuit density in 1965 .",
    "while this measure is incomplete , it suggests some caution is due when making comparisons of technical performance requirements with conventional architectures ( _ e.g. _ , energy consumption or device size ) , all of which operate within a similar 2d wired configuration .",

    "excellent agreement is observed except for a systematic tendency for simulations to produce smaller beams .",
    "simulations varying initial pulse chirp , radial phase and astigmatism suggest this is due to uncompensated nonlinear chirp in the amplified experimental pulses and because the slightly elliptical experimental beams possess an finite ( and asymmetric ) radial phase at the front face of the sf11 .",
    "these factors were not found to influence the interactions in any significant way except to delay the onset of collapse .",

    "may only be triggered with n>1 signals present .",
    "however , weak soliton - like dragging occurs unless symmetric signals are applied . as shown in supplementary figure 3 ( and observed experimentally in supplementary figure 2g - h ) , these angular deflections may allow all - optical control of the pump without causing collapse . in a properly designed network",
    ", the gate in supplementary figure 3 may thus have a useful operation : depending on signal input , it either steers the pump , leaves it unchanged , or causes it to collapse . for strict nand operation , we split signals symmetrically into to two copies , each containing one half the original signal energy .",

    "a useful gate must maximize the effect of the signal s perturbation to the pump while simultaneously ensuring that the pump does not destabilize in solitary propagation and can be restored for routing into subsequent gates . to this end , we established an operating regime by increasing the pump power until the pump beam size was observed to increase in size with pump power .",
    "we then chose to restrict the pump power below the lowest power for which the minimum beam size could be observed .",
    "this value is expected to depend on the details of the collapse - arresting mechanisms , as well as on the initial pulse parameters ( spot size , radial phase , pulse duration , chirp , etc . ) .",
    "manipulation of these parameters is thus expected to allow tuning of device performance .",
    "provided the pump power is set sufficiently below this point - the point where collapse occurs in the medium - gate operation should not be sensitive to noise . we have observed this insensitivity both experimentally and in simulation .",

    ", width=869 ]    we then introduced the signal beam at a small fraction of the pump power and varied the relative angle between the beams , for each angle scanning the time delay through zero .",
    "the signal beam perturbs the pump beam by causing it to collapse quicker , but also by changing the propagation of the pump through and beyond the collapse .",
    "accordingly , we observed strong interactions not only for angles near zero , but also at angles for which strong soliton - like effects were observed with equal beam powers ( see supplementary figure 2 a - f , figure 2 in the letter ) .",
    "it is also possible to observe soliton - like interactions with a weak signal , as in supplementary figure 2 g - h .",
    "these occur only for relatively large angles and do not provide significant net deflection .",
    "these interactions could be used to control the pump optically without causing collapse .",
    "supplementary figure 5a shows the ratio of energy transmitted through a 250 @xmath4 m square aperture without the signal present to that without the signal present for gain = 1 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath25 ) .",
    "supplementary figure 5b shows the same for gain = 5 .",
    "note the slightly different y - axis in the plots .",
    "these plots show roughly the extent to which the signal s presence causes the pump to transform , measured by the change in spatial energy distribution of the pump beam at the end of the sf11 rod . for equal energies ,",
    "very strong interactions occur for particular non - zero angles , which increase with the power in the beams . when gain is equal to 5 , relatively strong effects are still possible at these angles . in order to optimize the gate to be cascadable however , one must restrict the pump power below that for which collapse occurs in the gate without the signal present .",
    "supplementary figure 5c shows the transmission of the pump through the aperture without any perturbing signal beam . beyond about 4@xmath3 ( 1.36 mw )",
    ", the pump s transmission decreases with increasing power .",
    "this point of no return indicates that collapse has occurred in the material . during collapse",
    ", the pump will typically be affected by higher - order nonlinearities , as well as reshaping involving strong coupling between different effects .",
    "these effects make linear regeneration impossible .",
    "hence , we operate well below this value and choose a relative angle within a range of strong interaction , about 1.2 mrad .",
    "other operating points are possible . at a minimum ,",
    "the signal must cause collapse to occur within the gate and additional logic contrast can be obtained using non - zero angles for which the pump s spatiotemporal instability is most strongly excited during and beyond the collapse .",
    "however , provided collapse is induced by the signal and does not occur when the signal is absent , logic contrast will be enhanced with propagation through subsequent gates , linear regenerators and , if necessary , additional linear or nonlinear propagation ."

    "<S> an important feature of the logic operation that we describe below is that it is independent of these details , relying only on the universal ( occurring in nearly all materials ) transformation through collapse .    </S>",

    "<S> a and b are plotted with self - normalized color scales while c and d ( e and f ) are both normalized to the maximum in c ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> scale bars correspond to 200 @xmath4 m . </S>",

    "<S> the pump pulse is centered between three signals , which are arranged on the vertices of an equilateral triangle ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> this realizes fig . 1d but uses the freedom of three dimensions to cascade the gate within a smaller volume and with zero latency . </S>",

    "<S> 3 , right . further scaling is possible by placing additional signal beams within a circle centered on the pump . as shown in the fig s3 - 4 and supplementary discussion ii , we find that , by adjusting the signal geometry , this gate may simultaneously provide other logic functions , including 3d - nand , and facilitate signal - controlled pump steering . combining conventional binary - state logic with conditional steering and continuous , many - input gates should simplify system design and may provide more sophisticated computational functions .        </S>",
    "<S> if properly designed ( see supplementary discussion iii ) , logic gates based on the induced instability of the pump pulse possess all necessary qualities required for integration into a full - scale computer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the output pulse of one gate can drive a subsequent gate , and because they provide gain , there is capacity for fan - out . </S>",
    "<S> the insensitivity of evolution towards the townes profile to initial conditions intrinsically damps fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the gates provide logic level restoration ( fluctuations in input parameters do not result in fluctuations of output level ) and do not require critical biasing . indeed , </S>",

    "<S> the irreversibility of the collapse process enforces unidirectional errors , which will allow efficient error correction . </S>",
    "<S> the use of orthogonal circularly - polarized fields in an inverting logic operation eliminates phase - dependence and provides input - output isolation . </S>",
    "<S> electrical detection schemes that are independent of path - specific loss may be conceived ; most multi - point measurements of phase , spectrum or beam shape should work . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the distinct characteristics of pre- and post - collapse waves imply that the logic contrast will be enhanced by extended propagation@xcite ( e.g. , through subsequent gates ) . </S>",
    "<S> these criteria will be similarly satisfied with other physical realizations , where the transformation , or arrest of collapse , is mediated by effects other than kerr nonlinearity and dispersion@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> together , these features suggest caution in making direct comparison to the requirements of any previously - described systems . as an obvious step </S>",
    "<S> , the gates can be implemented in highly nonlinear materials , thereby lowering power and size requirements . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the advantages the gates provide for software however , they afford many advantages for novel hardware designs that , while radically different from electronic designs , may facilitate practical devices . </S>",
    "<S> devices may consist largely of homogenous , linear dielectrics ( even air ) , enabling low - loss , crosstalk - free continuous interconnection and control over the location of energy dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> quantum impedance conversion implies that only a minute sample of each pulse is required for electronic detection . </S>",
    "<S> hence , energy - efficient reuse of 1 ( and , if an efficient conversion scheme can be devised , 0 ) logic pulses should be possible over many computing cycles . </S>",
    "<S> these measures may combine for a device with very small net power dissipation in spite of the relatively high peak power required for gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> these illustrative example strategies merely hint at the architecture design possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> specific measures may improve gates themselves . </S>",
    "<S> for example : the pump s propagation may be controlled@xcite to avoid accidental collapse , and the signal characteristics may be adjusted to more strongly excite instability@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , using a weak pulse to trigger supercontinuuum generation@xcite has yielded gain > 100 and 30 db contrast . </S>",
    "<S> since the gates provide logical inversion , more immediate applications in signal processing should be possible@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated an approach towards a continuous , 3d , globally - interconnected , wireless optical computing architecture , based on the instability of optical waves in nonlinear media . complemented by emerging technologies in optical data storage and broadband interconnects , this opens a route to powerful computing technology . </S>",
