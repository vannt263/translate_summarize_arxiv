    "a topological quantum computer is a hypothetical device that relies upon a kind of topological symmetry in topologically ordered states of matter to carry out fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "usually , these topological phases are taken to be ( effectively ) 2-dimensional systems of anyons : point - like quasi - particles that emerge in certain condensed matter systems .",
    "topological phases of matter were first realized through quantum hall effects , for example in fractional quantum hall liquids in the experiments of tsui and strmer in 1982 @xcite which led to the nobel prize they shared with laughlin @xcite in 1998 . in the past few years @xcite the possibility of building a quantum computer using physical systems exhibiting topological phases has motivated significant investment of resources towards realizing such a project .",
    "both microsoft and alcatel - lucent are currently pursuing topological qubits . besides the potential commercial computational benefits",
    ", these states of matter are fascinating from both the physical and mathematical perspectives , connecting the seemingly unrelated subjects of quantum topology and condensed matter .",
    "the mathematical foundations of topological quantum computation are usually cast in categorical language . in this survey",
    "we will avoid categorical terminology in the hopes that this will broaden the readership , without significantly sacrificing precision .",
    "there are other expository works of varying length and precision on the subject .",
    "the shortest and most elementary is @xcite , written for a general audience .",
    "the text @xcite gives a fairly comprehensive account aimed at physicists , while the excellent survey @xcite mainly focuses on topological and condensed matter themes .",
    "the short survey @xcite introduces the topological model to mathematicians , while the very precise and complete @xcite makes full use of the categorical language .",
    "the main goal of this survey is to give non - experts a taste of the mathematics of topological quantum computation , illustrating how the theory arises naturally and hopefully inspiring further reading .",
    "in the first part of this survey we will present a first approximation of the mathematical model for anyons on surfaces .",
    "some technical details will be neglected , but these can be reconciled by further reading ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "the second part will be devoted to describing some of the recent advances and open problems based upon this model .",
    "according to @xcite : _ a system is in a topological phase if , at low temperatures and energies and long wavelengths , all observable properties e.g. , correlation functions are invariant under smooth deformations of the space - time manifold in which the system lives , _ or , alternatively , _ if its low energy effective field theory is a topological quantum field theory tqft , i.e. , a field theory whose correlation functions are invariant under diffeomorphisms . _ the mathematics of anyons in 2d can be distilled down to the study of ( quasi-)particles on surfaces .",
    "how such systems may arise in nature is explained in @xcite , we content ourselves to present figure [ fig1 ] as a mathematician s cartoon of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "electrons are effectively confined to a 2d disk due to the low energy , perpendicular magnetic field causes quasi - particles to emerge.,width=336 ]    the spin - statistics theorem of fierz and pauli shows that in 3 spacial dimensions , every particle is either a fermion or a boson : particle exchange of a system of two indistinguishable particles changes the state by at most a sign : @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically , this is related to the fact that the group of motions of two points in 3-dimensional space is @xmath1 , the group of order @xmath2 . in 2 spacial dimensions the group of motions of @xmath3 points in a disk is the braid group @xmath4 , an infinite group with generators : @xmath5 obeying :    1 .",

    "assuming we can manufacture , manipulate and measure 2-dimensional topological phases of matter , we have a scheme for topological quantum computation ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a topological quantum computation scheme : particle - antiparticle pairs are drawn from the vacuum , particle exchange is performed followed by a measurement of the resulting particle type(s).,width=345 ]    our first problem is now clear : how can we model a quantum mechanical system of anyons on a surface ?",
    "two mathematical facts emerge from the quantum computational scheme in figure [ fig2 ] : 1 ) to each surface with labeled points we must assign a hilbert space in a consistent way ( i.e. respecting the topological invariance and quantum mechanical constraints ) and 2 ) particle exchange must correspond to a unitary operation on the associated hilbert space .      let us explore the problem of assigning a hilbert space @xmath14 to a system of anyons @xmath15 on a surface @xmath16 , in a way consistent with quantum mechanical principles and the topological nature of anyons .",
    "what we will be describing is essentially the @xmath2-dimensional part of a @xmath17-tqft , see @xcite for an excellent online resource .",
    "suppose our system supports exactly @xmath18 distinguishable indecomposable anyon types , which we label by a set @xmath19 of `` colors '' or `` particle types '' .",
    "we include the vacuum as a sort of invisible anyon type which we label by @xmath20 , or sometimes @xmath21 .",
    "as we interpret the anyons as ( quasi)-particles , each anyon @xmath22 must have an antiparticle , which we denote by @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the vacuum is its own antiparticle so @xmath24 .",
    "anyons on a surface are point - like , so we may imagine them as small boundary circles on the surface labeled by @xmath25 .",
    "a convenient topological interpretation of anti - particles is that a positively oriented circle labeled by @xmath22 is the same as a negatively oriented circle labeled by @xmath23 .",
    "topological invariance means that any topologically allowed operations such as anyon exchange , or twisting part of a surface must correspond to a unitary operator on the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "the underlying hilbert space must remain the same , provided the operation leaves the topology of the surface @xmath16 with labeled punctures the same .",
    "the notions of _ entanglement _ , ( particle - anti - particle ) _ duality _ and _ locality _ lead us to the following :    * * disjoint union axiom * the hilbert space of two disjoint systems ( surfaces with labeled boundary ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 , considered as a composite system is @xmath28 . *",
    "* duality axiom * @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the surface @xmath16 with opposite orientation and @xmath31 means apply @xmath32 to each @xmath33 .",
    "* * gluing axiom * the global hilbert space is determined by local hilbert spaces .",
    "more precisely , if a surface @xmath34 with boundary labels @xmath15 is obtained from @xmath35 by gluing the boundary circles labeled by @xmath36 and @xmath37 together , then @xmath38    taken together , these axioms point us to a cut - and - paste procedure to determine the hilbert space associated to a surface with labeled boundary from `` initial conditions '' , i.e. the hilbert spaces of a few less complicated surfaces .",
    "the first three initial conditions are :    * * empty set axiom * @xmath39 * * disk axiom * @xmath40 * * annulus axiom * @xmath41    as axioms these are meant to be unquestioned  however they can be justified as consistency .",
    "for example , the disk and annulus axioms can be understood as particle - anti - particle creation rules .",
    "the last initial condition(s ) are meant to determine the hilbert spaces for all surfaces with labeled boundary , subject to compatibility with the previous axioms :    * * pants axiom * @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 is the sphere with three boundary components ( `` a pair of pants '' ) labeled by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the problem now is to choose the @xmath47 for all triples of labels @xmath48 compatible with all of the axioms .",
    "the alert reader will realize that the pants axiom does not uniquely assign a hilbert space to labeled pair of pants . indeed , there is a @xmath49-fold ambiguity : one for each permutation of the labels @xmath45 and @xmath46 !",
    "this technicality is dealt with by replacing surfaces @xmath16 by so - called _ @xmath50-surfaces _ or _ extended surface _ which have a bit more structure .",
    "the idea is that one should fix a particular `` standard '' surface with boundary and use it to parametrize all surfaces with boundary that are homeomorphic the the standard surface .",
    "the parametrization then removes the ambiguity .",
    "this is carefully addressed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) . for a sphere with punctures",
    "it amounts to choosing some labels as `` inputs '' and others as `` outputs '' and carefully ordering the labels along two parallel lines . for two input labels",

    "fusion channels _ @xmath53 : a hilbert space of dimension @xmath54 , see figure [ fig3 ] .     the labeled surface associated with the fusion channel @xmath53 , which is to be read upwards , and interpreted as the number of independent ways that particles @xmath22 and @xmath51 can fuse to give particle @xmath52.,width=153 ]    the interpretation of the hilbert space associated with the surface in figure [ fig3 ] as a fusion channel suits our purposes very well : we would like to imagine these as processes .",
    "dual to fusion channels are the _ splitting channels _ with @xmath55 input ( say @xmath52 ) and @xmath2 outputs ( say @xmath22 and @xmath51 ) denoted @xmath56 . using the axioms above , _ every _ state space can be obtained via tensor products and direct sums of splitting and fusion channels . which fusion / splitting channels correspond to the annulus axiom ? by choosing the fusion output or splitting input to be the vacuum @xmath20 label we get @xmath57 .",
    "use the gluing axiom and the annulus axiom to show that the state space with input and output @xmath22 has : @xmath58 .    the precise sense in which these space are dual will be described below .    in general @xmath59",
    ": this is due to the technicality mentioned above .",
    "however , using the annulus , gluing and disjoint union axioms one can show that @xmath60 : one simply glues cylinders ( annuli ) with labels @xmath46 and @xmath61 to change them from inputs to outputs and vice versa .",
    "similarly the duality axiom implies that @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , if we assume that every particle is indistinguishable from its anti - particle ( i.e. @xmath63 ) , the _ dimension _ of @xmath14 can be computed unambiguously : for then the @xmath47 are fully symmetric in the three indices .    to get a better intuition for how these axioms allow one to determine ( at least the dimension of ) the hilbert space of any surface with labeled boundary we suggest trying the following :    show that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the 2-dimensional torus .",
    "topological invariance provides many useful constraints on the numbers @xmath47 , since these are interpreted as dimensions of hilbert spaces associated with a thrice punctured sphere .",
    "for example , interchanging labels @xmath36 and @xmath61 ( i.e. braiding , but keeping both @xmath36 and @xmath61 as inputs ) is a topological ( commutativity ) operation , so @xmath66 . to give algebraic interpretations",
    "we define , for each label @xmath22 , a _ fusion _ matrix @xmath67 by @xmath68 . in this formalism",
    "the above calculations imply that @xmath69 .",
    "the _ fusion rules _ express the fusion channels as a superposition of particle types that can occur as an output with inputs @xmath36 and @xmath61 : @xmath70 . a cascade of fusion channels",

    "so far we have only discussed the spaces of states .",
    "we can now proceed to explore the unitary operations ( quantum gates ) , processes and further constraints in our model . to do this",
    ", we need to establish notation for states themselves .",
    "how do we describe a specific state in , for example , the fusion channel @xmath53 as in figure [ fig3 ] ?",
    "it is convenient to denote such a vector by the skeleton of the corresponding space , i.e. the trivalent graph with the three extremal vertices labeled by @xmath73 and @xmath52 and the degree three vertex labeled to distinguish it from other states in @xmath53 .",
    "for example , we might choose a basis for @xmath53 , so that there are @xmath74 labels .",
    "similarly , we use appropriately labeled graphs @xmath75 to denote states in the dual space @xmath76 .",
    "it is tempting , and indeed can be justified mathematically using the gluing axiom , to stack these graphs to represent a cascade of splitting / fusion operations .",
    "for example , if we compose compatibly labeled @xmath75 ( input @xmath52 , outputs @xmath73 ) and ( inputs @xmath73 , output @xmath52 ) the result is a vector in the @xmath55-dimensional state space @xmath77 .",
    "one typically choosing the bases so that this pairing coincides with the inner product on the hilbert space @xmath53 .",
    "a complete treatment of this diagrammatic yoga of _ graphical calculus _ involving such pictures can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix e ) and ( * ? ? ? * section 4.2 ) .",

    "some calculations of this form are illustrated in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "the vacuum state corresponds to a disk with boundary labeled by @xmath20 , which we can use as an invisible input or output without changing the state .",
    "the creation of a particle - antiparticle from the vacuum corresponds to a disk with boundary labeled by @xmath20 and two interior boundary circles labeled by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this process translates to a linear ( hermitian ) operator on state spaces : @xmath78 , with a corresponding ( dual ) annihilation @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , we assume we can create ( via some physical process ) any number of particle - antiparticle pairs , from which we obtain , from the vacuum state , a state in @xmath80 .",
    "this corresponds to _ initialization _ in the quantum computational model . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are given a system with state vector in @xmath81 we assume we can measure the total charge ( i.e. the label ) of a pair of adjacent particles , perhaps by bringing them together and measuring the energy .",
    "this is the _ measurement _ stage of the quantum computation , a hermitian operator represented graphically as composing with a fusion operator @xmath75 .",

    "more generally , we always obtain a unitary representation of the small group of _ pure braids _ consisting of those braids with each strand beginning and ending in the same position .",
    "the computational strength of the model is hidden in this unitary representation of @xmath4 .",
    "a particle @xmath22 is called * non - abelian * if the image of the @xmath4 representation on the state space of @xmath3 type @xmath22 particles is non - abelian ( for some @xmath3 ) . to have a reasonable computational model",

    "the search for non - abelian and universal anyons is a major thrust of experimental condensed matter physics .    to summarize the processes we assume are available : 1 ) we can create any number of particle - antiparticle pairs , 2 ) we may exchange these particles to rotate our initial state and 3 ) we may measure the particle type of any pair of neighboring particles .",
    "one key is that after braiding the particles world lines , a neighboring particle - antiparticle pair may have obtained a different total charge ( besides @xmath20 , i.e. the vacuum ) . to get meaningful information from this process",
    "we must repeat the same process several times , taking a tally of the outputs ( particle types ) .",
    "the topological degrees of freedom ensure that slight variations in the process ( e.g. small deviations in the trajectory of a particle in space - time ) do not influence the output .",
    "the empirically computed probability distribution of output particle types constitutes the result of the quantum computation .",

    "how can we distinguish indecomposable particle types ?",
    "2 .   is there a `` periodic table '' of topological phases of matter ?",
    "3 .   how can we detect non - abelian and universal anyons in ( idealized ) experiments ?",
    "for any two particles types @xmath22 and @xmath51 , we must have an ( idealized ) quantum process that distinguishes the particle types .",
    "essentially , we need to be able to determine some unknown particle type using creation , braiding and measurement .    creating particle - antiparticle pairs of types @xmath22 and @xmath51 , braiding and then measuring the amplitude of the vacuum output produces a constant map @xmath88 for each @xmath89 . for fixed @xmath22 , we require that the vector of outputs over all @xmath90 be linearly independent with ( in fact , orthogonal to ) that of any other @xmath91 . that is , the matrix @xmath92 must be orthogonal ( up to an overall phase).,width=249 ]    figure [ fig6 ] illustrates the process , which leads to a certain non - degeneracy constraint on the braiding .",

    "for this one should imagine that the particle @xmath22 is a small line segment so that the world lines are really ribbons rather than 1-dimensional curves .",
    "then if we twist @xmath22 by @xmath96 radians , its trajectory traces out a narrow ribbon with a twist . depicting trajectories as curves we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the topological twist . we must take care to remember that the picture on the left acquires a phase @xmath100 when pulled straight .",
