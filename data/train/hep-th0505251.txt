    "many physical systems may be efficiently modeled in a reduced number of spatial dimensions . in particular , certain static solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations exhibiting solitonic behavior , or at least spatial localization , have been shown to exist from hydrodynamics and condensed matter physics @xcite to relativistic field theories @xcite . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "the possibility that the four fundamental interactions of nature may be unified in theories with extra spatial dimensions has triggered a search for static nonperturbative higher - dimensional solutions of a variety of models derived from string theory @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions may be compact and much smaller than the usual three dimensions of space , as in kaluza - klein models @xcite , or they may be infinitely large , as in the recent randall - sundrum scenario , where gravity ( and , possibly , other fields ) can leak into one or more dimensions orthogonal to the 3-dimensional brane where matter and gauge fields propagate and interact@xcite .    in either higher - dimensional formulation ,",
    "there is plenty of motivation to search for @xmath1-dimensional nonperturbative configurations with @xmath0 quanta .",
    "the reasons are two - fold : first , as an upsurge of recent work suggests , it is possible that these extra dimensions may be much larger than the planckian scale @xcite .",
    "if the fundamental gravity scale is @xmath6 , the associated length scale of the extra dimensions is @xmath7 .",
    "[ @xmath8 is the number of extra dimensions . ] thus , if @xmath9 tev , @xmath10 cm . for @xmath11 ,",
    "this scenario is still acceptable by current tests of newton s gravitational law @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is possible that signatures of extra dimensions may be discovered in collider experiments @xcite .",
    "for example , energy may leak out into the bulk , disappearing from three dimensional space ( missing energy ) or , more relevantly for the present work , higher dimensional solitonic configurations may be produced at future accelerators , as has been recently suggested by one of us @xcite .",
    "thus , computing their properties , such as energy and spatial extension , and how they scale with spatial dimensionality , is of great interest : if the fundamental interactions giving rise to the observed configuration are known , their properties may serve as a probe to determine the dimensionality of spacetime @xcite .",
    "another reason for considering such objects is that they may well exist in a pre - compactification spacetime .",
    "being nonperturbative , they may contribute in as yet unknown ways to the compactification process or even to the stability of the compactified internal space .",
    "their existence may change the structure of the vacuum , a possibility worth exploring in the near future .    in the present work",
    "we will focus on a particular class of nonperturbative configurations called @xmath0-balls .",
    "this choice reflects the fact that they are  as will be shown  the simplest static , spatially - localized configurations that can be found in any number of spatial dimensions .",
    "they have been shown to appear in many versions of 3-dimensional field theories , supersymmetric or not ( see references in next paragraph ) and will most certainly be present in their higher - dimensional extensions , although we will not present a detailed study of specific examples here . as in the early work concerning 3-dimensional @xmath0-balls ,",
    "our strategy is to start by studying their properties in the simplest possible models that can support them .",
    "more specific applications are the next logical step .",
    "@xmath0-balls are non - dissipative , spatially - localized scalar field configurations that owe their stability to the conservation of a global charge @xmath0 @xcite . as such , they belong to the general class of nontopological objects constructed to bypass the limitations imposed by derrick s theorem forbidding the existence of static localized configurations of real scalar fields in more than one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of @xmath0-balls is that they can be constructed from a single complex scalar field ; most nontopological solitons are built out of two or more interacting scalars @xcite .",
    "since they were first proposed by coleman , these objects have triggered many different avenues of research : some searched for @xmath0-balls in nonabelian models @xcite or with several interacting fields @xcite , others in supersymmetric models @xcite and the effects of their mutual interactions @xcite , while others investigated their stability against quantum effects @xcite and their cosmological role @xcite .",
    "understandably , this past work was confined to the usual three spatial dimensions .",
    "given the recent upsurge of interest in higher - dimensional theories , we believe it important to investigate how the properties of @xmath0-balls depend on spatial dimensionality .",
    "although there is a trend to consider models with compactified extra dimensions , in this work we will consider only @xmath0-balls in flat @xmath12-dimensional minkowski spacetimes .",
    "one reason is that these objects will typically have radii @xmath13 which are much smaller than the scale of the compactified space , @xmath14 , in particular in the context of models with large extra dimensions @xcite ; that is , they will `` see '' a flat @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "our emphasis throughout this work is to explore how spatial dimensionality affects some of the key properties of @xmath0-balls : their energy , minimal charge , and size . for this purpose",
    ", we will employ a combination of analytical and numerical tools , often contrasting one with another .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the class of models we will be working with , establishing notation and definitions .",
    "we also obtain a @xmath1-dimensional virial relation for @xmath0-balls that is shown to encompass derrick s theorem when @xmath15 . in section 3",
    ", we define the type of potentials we will be using throughout this work and study large @xmath0-balls , using a variational ansatz for their spatial profiles to estimate their energies and explore some of their properties .",
    "we contrast our results with numerical computations . in section 4",
    "we treat small @xmath0-balls , again using a variational approach .",
    "we show that the concept of `` small '' @xmath0-ball makes more sense for lower dimensional models , as dimensionality greatly affects the minimum charge for these objects .",
    "we obtain an analytical estimate for the minimum charge @xmath16 as a function of spatial dimension @xmath1 accurate for @xmath17 , and find a simple relation , @xmath18 $ ] . in section 5 we briefly explore the existence of @xmath0-clouds in @xmath1 dimensions .",

    "this is an example of nonperturbative effects dominating the physics of the vacuum .",
    "if a model supports such configurations , one can not claim to understand the physics of the vacuum before incorporating their contribution .",

    "@xmath32    from the associated conserved current @xmath33 , one obtains the charge conservation law ,    @xmath34    in practice , @xmath0-balls are very similar to critical bubbles in the theory of homogeneous nucleation or , to use coleman s expression , false vacuum decay @xcite",
    ". the latter is characterized by an asymmetric double - well potential , with the field initially trapped in the false vacuum state .",
    "the critical bubble or bounce is the spherically - symmetric static solution to the equation of motion that interpolates ( or almost ) between the two potential minima : at @xmath35 , @xmath36 is close to the global minimum @xmath37 and , as @xmath38 , it approaches the false vacuum at @xmath27 .",
    "the field configurations for @xmath0-balls do the same . but how could this be if the potential @xmath39 has a global and not a local minimum at @xmath27 ?",
    "the answer , a clever trick , comes from the term in the equation of motion proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "this term contributes an effective negative mass to the potential : for certain choices of @xmath41 , it makes the minimum at some @xmath37 the global minimum and the minimum at @xmath27 the false vacuum .",
