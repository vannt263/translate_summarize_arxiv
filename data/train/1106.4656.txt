    "<S> pacs numbers : 74.20.fg , 03.65.yz    the bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite is based on the simple hamiltonian but it captures the essential physics not only for superconductivity of electrons in metals , but also the superconductivity of atomic nuclei , nuclear matter , neutron stars @xcite , and cold atomic fermi - gases @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> based on the lindblad master equation , we propose the extension of the bcs theory to the open quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the order parameter  </S>",
    "<S> the density of cooper pairs , and optionally the order parameters of a superconducting reservoir , self consistently . a simple model of a single spinful fermionic level embedded into a fermionic reservoir is proposed . for a self consistent treatment of the reservoir </S>",
    "<S> we recover the standard mean - field superconducting phase transition in the grand - canonical ( equilibrium ) state , whereas for a fixed state of the reservoir , we find that the state of the system follows the state of the reservoir , being either superconducting or normal .    </S>",

    "<S> introducing ( time - dependent ) averages @xmath7 , and using wick theorem we approximate ( [ eq : exacth ] ) by the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the complex order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_def ] ) can be diagonalized by the canonical bogoliubov transformation @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are bogoliubov quasiparticles , which satisfy standard anticommutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal form of the hamiltonian is @xmath13 we assume that our system is embedded into a superconducting bath described by a macroscopic gas of bogoliubov quasiparticles , which can be exchanged with the system . </S>",
    "<S> this process is quite generally described by a combination of the following @xmath14 lindblad operators @xmath15 superconducting properties of the bath are not necessarily the same as of the embedded system , so the angles @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , may be different from @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constants @xmath20 are connected to the fermi - dirac distribution of the normal modes of the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_def ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a parameter controlling the strength of the system - bath coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to rewrite the lindblad equation in terms of hermitian majorana fermions @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> since our master equation is quadratic in terms of @xmath26 , we obtain a closed set of equations for the covariance matrix @xmath27 : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a real , anti - symmetric @xmath30 matrix , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real matrices @xmath33 note that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) is non - linear , as @xmath34 and @xmath19 depend again on covariances through the relation ( [ eq : delta ] ) . if in addition , we determine the lindblad operators self - consistently , which means that the bath has the same properties as the embedded system , then we should also set @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> fixed points of the flow ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) , which are solutions of the continuous lyapunov equation @xmath38 determine the stationary states of the system . </S>",
    "<S> these stationary states may not be unique because of the non - linearity . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can show that a stable fixed point is unique . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from the fact that all linear relaxation rates , i.e. eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath31 ( [ eq : x ] ) , @xmath39 , have strictly positive real parts for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> one can further show that all solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lyap ] ) are of the form @xmath41 which is specified by only three real variables @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the lyapunov equation should be solved self - consistently ( [ eq : delta ] ) , i.e. @xmath43 let us now consider two possible cases of the bath , i.e. two possible choices of angles @xmath44 :     versus the inverse temperature . </S>",

    "<S> \\(i ) _ fixed bath . </S>",
    "<S> _ if the bath is considered fixed , we can set @xmath50 without loss of generality , so the equation together with the lyapunov equation ( [ eq : lyap ] ) results in the conditions @xmath51 for normal , non - superconducting bath , @xmath52 , and there exists only a trivial solution @xmath53 for the system . </S>",
    "<S> for a superconducting bath , @xmath54 , the system is always superconducting as well , for all inverse temperatures @xmath55 , as the only solution ( [ eq : fixedbath ] ) has @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , for a superconducting bath the embedded system can not be in the normal state no matter how small the parameter @xmath22 is .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) _ self - consistent bath . _ </S>",
    "<S> the bath can be considered self - consistent in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> we associate the lindblad operators with the normal mode creation and annihilation operators such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 . inserting these assumptions in the lyapunov equation </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath59 the consistency conditions now result in @xmath60 we always have the trivial solution @xmath53 , however for temperatures smaller than @xmath61 where @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> we also find superconducting solution with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , critical temperature only exists for @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : condition2 ] , [ eq : betac ] ) are exactly the result that we get in standard grand canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the bath - self - consistency conditions completely eliminate dependence of the properties of the stationary state on the system - bath coupling @xmath22 .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase ] we plot a phase diagram @xmath64 , for both cases ( i , ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that only if @xmath65 is smaller than @xmath66 then we may have @xmath67 for some temperature @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have investigated fixed points of the non - linear flow ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us now address the question of their stability by investigating the full dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we shall only focus on the case ( ii ) of self - consitently determined baths , which possesses non - unique stationary solution below the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical equations for @xmath69 follow directly from equation ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) with the ansatz ( [ eq : z ] ) . by means of self - consistency equations ( [ eq : selfc ] ) we replace @xmath70 by @xmath71 , resulting in a system of three non - linear differential equations @xmath72 note that the first equation ( [ eq : dt ] ) is independent from the other two , and yields a closed first order differential equation for the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath34 . writing it as @xmath73 we can easily study the stability of two possible fixed points @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 if @xmath80 ) . for the trivial fixed point we find @xmath81 which means that the non - superconducting state is stable @xmath82 if @xmath83 and unstable @xmath84 if @xmath80 . as for the second , non - trivial fixed point @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily show that it is always stable @xmath85 if it exists , i.e. if @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of the order parameter @xmath86 in different cases is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dynamic ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the other two phase - space variables @xmath87 are completely _ enslaved _ by the order parameter @xmath86 , so they again converge either to their trivial ( non - superconducting ) or non - trivial ( superconducting ) fixed point values .     as a function of time , for @xmath83 ( red curves ) and @xmath80 ( black curves ) , and for an attractive potential @xmath88 ( full curves ) and a repulsive potential @xmath89 ( dashed curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> we plot some typical trajectories starting from green points and ending in one of the two stable fixed points ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerical values of parameters are @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in conclusion , based on the lindblad master equation we proposed the extension of the bcs theory to open fermi systems exchanging bogouliubov quasiparticles with the bath . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the equations of motion for the covariance matrix and found the fixed points of the flow equations . </S>",
    "<S> if the bath is considered self - consistently with the system , the results becomes equivalent to the grand canonical ensemble and all dependences on the lindblad dissipators are eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> if the superconductivity of the bath is fixed , the system remains in the superconducting state for all values of temperature no matter how small the system - bath coupling is . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the stability analysis of the fixed points and found that below the critical temperature the fixed point which corresponds to the normal phase is not stable , whereas the superconducting solution is stable . note that our results are closely related to an exact treatment of open bcs model in quasi - spin formulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the ( quasi-)particles can not be exchanged with the system , so the study of thermodynamic limit is more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> we thus believe that our single - level formulation provides a minimal model of open bcs quantum dynamics and should serve as the first step in approaching the non - equilibrium open bcs models with several different temperature / particle reservoirs .    </S>",
