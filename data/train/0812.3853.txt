    "one of the most fascinating arenas for testing general relativity in the neighborhood of a real astrophysical black hole is undoubtedly represented by sgr a * , the massive black hole ( mbh ) at the center of our galaxy , whose existence has been now strongly proven by the combination of radio , sub - mm , x - ray , and near infrared ( nir ) observations . while in the radio domain sgr a * appears as a steady and motionless compact source @xcite , its x - ray , sub - mm , and nir counterparts are variable since they exhibit outbursts of energy ( _ flares _ ) , which typically last for a few hours and occur several times a day @xcite .",
    "these flares are likely due to energetic events arising very close to the central mbh , on a scale of a few schwarzschild radii , and they can be interpreted as due to emission from matter in relativistic orbits around sgr a*. moreover , by using large class telescopes , such as the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) and the keck telescopes , and thanks to the adaptive optics , it has been possible to observe a multitude of stars in the @xmath1 band ( the so - called s - stars ) moving in the gravitational potential of the galactic mbh @xcite .",
    "the entire system is perfectly described by a single point mass and newton gravity .",
    "very recently , @xcite have been able to determine the orbits of 28 s - stars , resting upon the results of 16 years of monitoring of their motions . in particular , it has been possible to observe the whole orbit of the famous star s2 , since it has completed a full revolution around sgr a*. the value of the galactic mbh mass , extrapolated from these improved data , is @xmath2 m@xmath3 .    since the theory of general relativity predicts that the central mbh can act as a powerful gravitational lens on s - stars , some of them , depending on the knowledge of their orbital parameters , have been the object of careful investigations .",
    "the strategy of this study is very clear .",
    "in fact , knowing the position of the s - stars in space as a function of time , it is easy to predict the time of their periapse , that is the closest approach to sgr a * , and look for possible alignments between one of them and the lens , corresponding to the mbh , along the line of sight of an observer on the earth . in this way , it is possible to foresee at any time where to look for a secondary image , what its apparent magnitude should be , and , thanks to our knowledge of their orbits , easily predict the best time to observe them .",
    "s2 was the first star to be studied as a possible source for gravitational effects due to the central mbh @xcite .",
    "the light curve for its secondary image , as well as the first two relativistic images , were calculated in the schwarzschild black hole hypothesis .",
    "the analysis was then enlarged by @xcite , who achieved the light curves for the secondary images of five more s - stars .",
    "an important fact that emerges from the latter study is that the light curves are peaked around the periapse epoch , but two subpeaks may arise in nearly edge - on orbits , when the source is behind sgr a * ( _ standard lensing _ ) or in front of it ( _ retrolensing _ ) . in this respect",
    ", the star s14 represents an emblematic case .    in the present paper",
    "we want to extend the previous analysis of @xcite to the new set of 28 s - stars , provided by @xcite .",
    "we will see that , within these stars , s6 turns out to be a particularly intriguing source for gravitational lensing , since its secondary image is potentially observable by incoming interferometric instruments .",
    "our aim is to calculate the position and the luminosity of the secondary images of the 28 s - stars as functions of time , generated by the mbh at the center of our galaxy .",
    "the secondary image appears on the opposite side of the black hole with respect to the source and is thus formed by light rays passing behind the mbh . defining the deflection angle @xmath4 as the angle between the asymptotic directions of motion of the light rays , before and after the rendezvous with the black hole , the lens equation is @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the alignment angle of the source , that is the angle between the line connecting the source to the lens and the optical axis , defined as the line connecting the observer to the lens .",
    "the geometry of the lensing configuration is such that @xmath6 runs from 0 ( perfect alignment ) to @xmath7 ( perfect anti - alignment ) .",
    "@xmath8 is the impact angle for the light rays as seen from the observer , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the distances between the observer and the lens , and the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is given by the distance of the sun to the galactic center , which is currently estimated to be @xmath11 kpc @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we obtain @xmath10 and @xmath6 as functions of time by an accurate modelling of the keplerian orbit of the s - stars around the mbh , taking into account the measured values of the orbital parameters .",
    "for all the details , the reader is referred to @xcite .    as explained in @xcite , the lens equation ( [ lens eq ] )",
    "is the closest to the exact treatment of deflection by a spherically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "the relative error in the position of the images committed by using eq . ( [ lens eq ] ) is at most of the order of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "this number stays lower than @xmath14 in the worst cases .",
    "the deflection angle is calculated assuming that the black hole is spherically symmetric , thus being described by a schwarzschild metric . since the secondary image of",
    "an s - star demands a deflection angle in the whole range @xmath15 $ ] , we can not adopt the weak - field or the strong deflection limit approximation , but we have to calculate the exact deflection angle in terms of elliptic integrals @xcite .",
    "finally , the magnification of a secondary image is given by the general formula @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance between the observer and the source .",
    "in the nir band , the sgr a * stellar cluster has been originally observed with the eso s ntt starting from 1992 , then with the keck from 1995 , and with the vlt from 2002 . the good synergy between the adaptive optics and the 8m/10m - class telescopes @xcite allowed to push the astronomical imaging and the spectroscopy for point sources to a deep sensitivity , that is @xmath18 at an angular resolution of @xmath19 mas @xcite . thanks to these powerful instruments of astronomical investigation , it was possible to monitor the s - stars for more than 16 years and reconstruct for some of them their keplerian orbits around the galactic mbh @xcite . the orbital parameters of these 28 stars are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .    following the steps described in section [ sec lens ] , we have calculated the light curves of the secondary images of the mentioned 28 stars .",
    "the main features of these images are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] , allowing an immediate reading of the results . besides the values of the minimum magnitude for the secondary images and the epochs at which they peak , we also report the time spent by the secondary images when their luminosity is greater than half of the maximum , the alignment angle and the distance from the mbh of the source stars at the peak , and the maximal angular distance of the secondary images from the apparent shadow of the black hole ( whose angular radius is @xmath20 @xcite ) .    among all the s - stars analyzed ,",
    "we concentrate our attention on three particular cases : s6 , s17 , and s27 , characterized by a value of the orbit inclination very close to @xmath21 .",
    "this feature qualifies them as very appealing candidates for gravitational lensing by the mbh . in figure  [ fig 1 ] we report the light curves for the secondary images of the three mentioned stars ( left column ) and the alignment angles as functions of time ( right column ) .",
    "s6  this star is indeed the most interesting one , since its orbit is nearly edge - on ( @xmath22 ) , and its eccentricity brings it quite close to the black hole ( up to 4800 @xmath23 ) .",
    "the best alignment and anti - alignment times are very close to the periapse epoch and are responsible for two subpeaks , see figure  [ fig 1]a . by examining the figure",
    "[ fig 1]b , we notice that first we have the alignment peak ( @xmath24 ) , and then the anti - alignment peak ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "what makes s6 particularly interesting is the high brightness attained by the secondary image . at the best alignment time , that will occur in 2062 , the secondary image has a magnitude @xmath0 , and the maximal angular distance from the apparent shadow of the mbh is about @xmath26 mas , according to the current estimates of the orbital parameters .",
    "s17  the orbit of this star is nearly edge - on as well ( @xmath27 ) . yet , contrarily to the previous case , the eccentricity of s17 is very low and the periapse occurs in proximity of one of the nodes . for this reason , the alignment and anti - alignment peaks occur at opposite epochs in the period and neither of them is particularly bright ( figures  [ fig 1]c and [ fig 1]d ) .",
    "s27  from a gravitational - lensing point of view , the inclination of the orbit of this star is the most favorable among all the known s - stars ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "moreover , the eccentricity of the orbit is very close to one .",
    "however , the periapse occurs in correspondence to the anti - alignment epoch ( compare figure  [ fig 1]e with figure  [ fig 1]f ) . by reflex",
    ", the anti - alignment peak is very tight and hardly visible in figure  [ fig 1]e because s27 moves very fast at that time .",
    "conversely , the alignment peak is not so bright ( @xmath29 ) as in the case of s6 , but anyway better than s14 and s17 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the angular separation of the secondary image of s27 reaches almost 0.4 mas at the best alignment time , which puts this star in a very good position for possible observations .",
    "thanks to the great technological advances earned by the modern big - class telescopes , it has been possible to have access to very remote zones of the milky way , like the neighborhood of its center , where the radio source sgr a * lies .",
    "the discovery that most of the detected stars in this region move along tight keplerian orbits is a strong indication of the existence of a very compact object of more than @xmath30 m@xmath3 , currently recognized as a massive black hole , in the geometrical center of the milky way .",
    "this great disclosure opens an amazing way of escape from the meanders of theoretical speculations and allows us to study gravitational lensing by a black hole on a real case and test general relativity in its strong field regime .",
    "the idea of using the star s2 as a potential source to be lensed by the central mbh , was conceived originally by @xcite , and then acquired and rigorously developed by @xcite , who considered other s - stars as further possible sources for this phenomenology . in this paper , we extend the previous analysis to a new set of 28 s - stars provided by @xcite .",
    "whereas most of these stars have undetectable secondary images , there are some cases in which the lensed images have a significant probability of being detected by incoming instruments , as can be deduced from table  [ tbl-2 ] . among these , s6 represents the best case since its secondary image at the peak reaches @xmath0 , with an angular separation of 0.3 mas from the central black hole . actually , the perspectives for observing such an event are not so far from what the modern technology is developing . in fact , in 2013 the new second - generation vlti instrument , called gravity , will be scientifically operative at the eso paranal observational site @xcite .",
    "this instrument , specifically designed to observe highly relativistic motions of matter close to the event horizon of sgr a * , will interferometrically combine the nir light collected by the four - units telescope of the vlt , exploiting all the potential of this extremely powerful eso observatory .",
    "the resolution that will be obtained in the nir band is @xmath31 mas for objects that can be as faint as @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , in its astrometric mode , gravity will have an accuracy of @xmath33 @xmath34 , allowing to study the motions of celestial objects to within a few times the event horizon size of the galactic mbh .",
    "there are still many years before the secondary images of the best known s - stars will shine again ( 2047 for s14 , 2062 for s6 and s27 ) .",
    "surely , new s - stars will be discovered and followed along their orbits , eventually providing even better candidates for gravitational lensing . in the meanwhile , we have no doubt that the astronomical community will fortify its stock of observational facilities with new advanced instruments , which will be able to catch this extraordinary kind of gravitational lensing events .",

    "<S> the existence of a massive black hole in the center of the milky way , coinciding with the radio source sgr a * , is being established on more and more solid ground . in principle , this black hole , acting as a gravitational lens , is able to bend the light emitted by stars moving within its neighborhood , eventually generating secondary images . extending a previous analysis of the gravitational lensing phenomenology to a new set of 28 stars , whose </S>",
    "<S> orbits have been well determined by recent observations , we have calculated all the properties of their secondary images , including time and magnitude of their luminosity peaks and their angular distances from the central black hole . the best lensing candidate is represented by the star s6 , since the magnitude of its secondary image at the peak reaches @xmath0 , with an angular separation of 0.3 mas from the central black hole , that is just at the borders of the resolution limit in the @xmath1 band of incoming astronomical instruments . </S>"
