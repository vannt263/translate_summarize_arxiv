    "radio observations of synchrotron emission is an important source of information about astrophysical magnetic fields ( see ginzburg 1981 ) .",
    "diffuse synchrotron emission is observed throughout the ism and the icm , as well as in the lobes of radio galaxies ( e.g. westerhout et al .",

    "observations testify that turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics ( see armstrong et al .",
    "1994 , lazarian 2009 , chepurnov & lazarian 2010 ) .",
    "as most astrophysical environments are magnetized and relativistic electrons are in most cases are present , the turbulence results in synchrotron fluctuations , which carry important information , but at the same time , interfere with attempts to measure cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with high precision .",
    "in addition , synchrotron fluctuations present an impediment for studying fluctuations of atomic hydrogen distribution in the early universe .",
    "the latter has become a direction of intensive discussion recently ( see loeb & zaldarriaga 2004 , pen et al . 2008 ,",
    "loeb & wyithe 2008 , liu , et al .",
    "2009 , ferdinandez et al .",
    "if we know the spectrum of underlying turbulence , these fluctuations can be separated from the cmb signal ( see cho & lazarian 2010 ) .",
    "better cleaning of the cmb maps is particularly important while analyzing polarized radiation in the search of enigmatic b - modes produced by gravitational waves in the early universe .",
    "the polarized synchrotron present a important foreground that such studies have to deal with .",
    "a number of earlier studies tried to utilize synchrotron intensity fluctuation to obtain the spectrum and anisotropies of underlying magnetic turbulence ( see getmantsev 1959 , chibisov & ptuskin 1981 , lazarian & shutenkov 1990 , lazarian & chibisov 1991 , chepurnov 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , polarization fluctuations were proposed to address the complex issues of measuring magnetic field helicity ( waelkens et al .",
    "2009 , junklewitz & enlin 2011 ) .",
    "the serious limitation of all the above studies was that it was done for a single spectral index of relativistic electrons that allowed to write the synchrotron emissivity not as generally applicable @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a perpendicular component of magnetic field and @xmath2 depends on the spectrum of emitting electrons , but only for @xmath3 . in a way",
    ", the studies were limited to a single point of a parameter space .",
    "the above deficiency was addressed in our recent study ( lazarian & pogosyan 2012 , henceforth lp12 ) where we provided the statistical description synchrotron fluctuations for an arbitrary index @xmath2 corresponding to the actual energy distribution of relativistic electrons . very importantly , rather than taking a usual ad hoc and incorrect assumption that magnetic field in turbulent media can be presented as @xmath4 , i.e. as a superposition of a regular magnetic field @xmath5 and _ isotropic _ stochastic magnetic field we used the model of the turbulence for realistic anisotropic magnetic turbulence which corresponds to theoretical expectations ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 , see brandenburg & lazarian 2013 for a review ) and supported by numerical simulations in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) and kowal & lazarian ( 2010 ) .",
    "these two advances brought the studies of magnetic turbulence using synchrotron to a new stage .",
    "testing of the expressions obtained in lp12 has been performed with synthetic data in heron et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the study in lp12 was mostly dealing with synchrotron intensities .",
    "present day telescopes present opportunities to get detailed maps of polarization .",
    "in fact , the position - position frequency ( ppf ) data cubes are getting available with high spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "such data cubes present a good opportunity for studying magnetic turbulence , provided that the description of the relation of the synchrotron polarization statistics and the statistics of the underlying magnetic fields is available .",
    "we also derived correlations of synchrotron polarization but did not deal with the important effect of faraday rotation of the polarized radiation that arises as radiation propagates in the magnetized plasmas .",
    "the angle of polarized radiation rotation is proportional to the @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wavelength of the radiation , the integration is done along the line - of - sight , while @xmath8 is the component of magnetic field along the line - of - sight and @xmath9 is the density of electrons in thermal plasmas . in terms of synchrotron polarization",
    "the effects of faraday rotation decrease the polarization and introduce additional fluctuations arising from both fluctuations of parallel component of magnetic field as well as electron density . therefore ignoring the faraday rotation while dealing with polarized intensity",
    "can only be justified for sufficiently short wavelengths .",
    "faraday rotation measurements have been extensively used for studying regular and fluctuating components of magnetic fields using radio emission of external sources , e.g. point radio sources .",
    "in addition , the effect of faraday depolarization was used to probe magnetic field at different distances from the observer .",
    "indeed , by changing the wavelength of the radiation one can vary the contribution of polarized synchrotron emission from the regions at different distances along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , using longer the wavelengths one can sample emission from closer emitting volumes .",
    "in fact , our present study shows that the criterium for sampling the turbulence with synchrotron polarization is different from the one for intensity studies .",
    "more recently there have been renewed interest to getting detailed maps of diffuse synchrotron emission that experiences faraday rotation within the emitting volume ( beck et al .",
    "these new studies provide position - position - frequency ( ppf ) data cubes which exhibit an intricate structure of fluctuations that arise from both the fluctuations of magnetic field and the fluctuations in the faraday measure .",
    "our paper opens new ways of using these ppf data cubes for studying turbulence by providing the analytical description of fluctuations in these data cubes .",
    "in particular , we below we describe techniques for studying polarization fluctuations at a given wavelength as a function of spatial separation .",
    "we also explore the potential of the dispersion of the polarized signal when it is studies as a function of frequency . the first technique with separated lines - of - sight some has similarities to the velocity channel analysis ( vca ) technique that employs spectral doppler - shifted lines to study velocity turbulence introduced by us some time ago ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2004 ) , while the studies of the frequency dependence of the dispersion has some similarities to the velocity correlation spectrum ( vcs ) technique that was suggested by us later , i.e. in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "both vca and vcs make use of position position velocity ( ppv ) spectral data which is an analog of ppf in the present analysis .",
    "both techniques have been successfully employed to study velocity turbulence data ( see lazarian 2009 for a review ) . in analogy with these techniques",
    "we term the technique based on the analysis of spatial fluctuations of polarization polarization spatial analysis ( psa ) , which is an analog of vca for velocity data cubes , and on the analysis of frequency dependence of the polarization variance , polarization variance analysis ( pva ) , which is an analog of vcs . in view of the revival of interest to the faraday rotation synthesis technique ( brentjens & bruyn 2005 ) we discuss how to use this technique within the pva approach .",
    "we would like to stress that there are two major advantages of using different techniques for studying turbulence .",
    "first of all , they measure different components of turbulent cascade .",
    "for instance , it is advantageous to measure independently both the spectrum of velocity and the spectrum of magnetic field .",
    "this , for instance , is possible combining vca and psa measurements for the same media .",
    "second , combining different techniques it is possible to study whether properties of magnetic turbulence in different media , e.g. to explore the continuity the turbulent cascade in different phases of the ism and test whether the cascade is these phases corresponds to the big power law in the sky ( armstrong et al .",
    "1994 , chepurnov & lazarian 2010 ) .",
    "the present paper follows the pattern of our earlier publications on studying spectrum of turbulence from observations ( see lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "we obtain general expressions , but are focused on obtaining the asymptotic regimes for turbulence statistics .",
    "while , as we discuss in the paper , these asymptotic expressions are informative , the full expressions may have advantages for the analysis of observational data as was shown in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . indeed , in the latter paper , apart from the spectral slope , the injection scale of turbulence and the turbulence mach number were obtained .",
    "we expect that additional measures , e.g. injection scale and variations of turbulence intensities along different directions , can be available .",
    "in what follows , we discuss the basic statistics of mhd turbulence that we seek to obtain using synchrotron polarization fluctuations in  [ sec : mhdstat ] , introduce the measures and explore the properties of synchrotron statistics in  [ sec : syncstat ] , introduce the correlations of polarization at different spatial points , i.e. psa technique in ",
    "[ sec : samelambda ] and discuss the statistics of measures along the same line of sight in  [ sec : lineofsight ] . in ",
    "[ sec : additionalways ] we discuss additional measures , including spatial correlations of the derivatives of polarization _ wrt _ to wavelength , and application to interferometers .",
    "on the basis of our formalism we formulate new techniques of turbulence study with synchrotron polarization in  [ sec : results ] and provide the discussion of our results and comparison of the different ways to study magnetic turbulence in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the latter section may be the most useful for researchers interested in practical application of the techniques .",
    "our findings are summarized in  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "this paper deals with developing the technique for obtaining properties of magnetic turbulence from observations .",
    "turbulence in magnetized plasmas plays a crucial role for the processes of cosmic ray propagation ( see schlickeiser 2003 , longair 2011 ) , star formation ( see elmegreen & scalo 2005 , mckee & ostriker 2007 ) , heat transfer in magnetized plasmas ( see narayan & medvedev 2001 , lazarian 2006 ) , magnetic reconnection ( see lazarian & vishniac 1999 , kowal et al . 2009 , eyink et al .",
    "2011 , see review lazarian et al .",
    "2015 and ref . therein ) .",
    "the advantage of statistical description of turbulence is that it allows to reveal regular features within chaotic picture of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "recent reviews on mhd turbulence include brandenburg & lazarian ( 2013 ) and beresnyak & lazarian ( 2015 ) .",
    "in this paper we use the statistical description of turbulence and claim that it is an adequate and concise way to characterize many essential properties of interstellar turbulence .",
    "indeed , while turbulence is an extremely complex chaotic non - linear phenomenon , it allows for a remarkably simple statistical description ( see biskamp 2003 ) .",
    "if the injections and sinks of the energy are correctly identified , we can describe turbulence for _ arbitrary _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the simplest description of the complex spatial variations of any physical variable , @xmath12 , is related to the amount of change of @xmath13 between points separated by a chosen displacement @xmath14 , averaged over the entire volume of interest . usually the result is given in terms of the fourier transform of this average , with the displacement @xmath14 being replaced by the wavenumber @xmath15 parallel to @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "for example , for isotropic turbulence the kinetic energy spectrum , @xmath17 , characterizes how much energy resides at the interval @xmath18 . at some large scale @xmath19 ( i.e. , small @xmath20 )",
    ", one expects to observe features reflecting energy injection . at small scales , energy dissipation should be seen . between these two scales",
    "we expect to see a self - similar power - law scaling reflecting the process of non - linear energy transfer , which for kolmogorov turbulence results in the famous @xmath21 relation .",
    "however , from the point of view of astrophysics both the injection scale or multiple injection scales ( see yoo & cho 2014 ) , which are also expected in interstellar medium , as well as dissipation scale are of great interest .    for our statistical description , we need to know what are expected properties of mhd turbulence , e.g. to know which range of spectral indexes we should consider deriving our asymptotic solutions and what other effects , e.g. related to anisotropy we should consider .",
    "apparently , mhd turbulence is more complex than the hydrodynamical one .",
    "magnetic field defines the chosen direction of anisotropy ( montgomery & turner 1981 , shebalin , matthaeus & montgomery 1983 , higdon 1984 ) . for small scale motions",
    "this is true even in the absence of the mean magnetic field in the system . in this situation",
    "the magnetic field of large eddies defines the direction of anisotropy for smaller eddies .",
    "this observation brings us to the notion of _ local system of reference _ , which is one of the major pillows of the modern theory of mhd turbulence .",
    "therefore a correct formulation of the theory requires wavelet description ( see kowal & lazarian 2010 ) . indeed , a customary description of anisotropic turbulence using parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers assumes that the direction is fixed in space .",
    "in this situation , however , the turbulence loses its universality in the sense that , for instance , the critical balance condition of the widely accepted model incompressible mhd turbulence ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 , henceforth gs95 ) which expresses the equality of the time of wave transfer along the magnetic field lines and the eddy turnover time is not satisfied .",
    "the existence of the local scale dependent anisotropy does not mean that describing synchrotron fluctuations as they are seen by the observer one should use the gs95 description . in fact , the local system of reference in most cases is not available to the observer who measures turbulence in the system of mean magnetic field . in such a system ,",
    "the anisotropy is also present , but it is independent of scale ( see the discussion in cho et al . 2002 ) and the perpendicular alfvnic perturbations absolutely dominate the spectrum of fluctuations from alfvnic turbulence .",
    "therefore the expected spectrum from gs95 is kolmogorov - type with @xmath22 ( see cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002 ) .",
    "the tensor for turbulence with the scale - independent anisotropy in the global system of reference is given in lp12 and discussed for realizations of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "it is important to understand that , contrary to the entrenched in the community notion , mhd _ compressible _ turbulence can be described in simple terms .",
    "numerical studies support the notion that the turbulence of fast modes develops mostly on its own and corresponds to the spectrum of acoustic turbulence , i.e. @xmath23 ( cho & lazarian 2002 , 2003 , kowal & lazarian 2010 ) .",
    "the slow mode fluctuations are expected to follow the spectrum of the alfvn mode ( gs95 , lithwick & goldreich 2001 , cho & lazarian 2002 )",
    ". shocks , which are inevitable for highly supersonic turbulence , are expected to induce steeper turbulence with spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "steepening of observed velocity fluctuations was reported in padoan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and chepurnov et al .",
    "these groups used for their studies the vcs technique ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2006 ) .",
    "it is interesting to know whether magnetic field fluctuations will also demonstrate the corresponding steepening .",
    "thus the development of the corresponding techniques is important from the point of view of establishing the correct spectral slope of magnetic fluctuations in mhd turbulence .",
    "we should mention that the theory of mhd turbulence is a developing field with its ongoing debates . while we feel that among all the existing models the gs95 provides the best correspondence to the existing numerical and observational data ( see beresnyak & lazarian 2010 , chepurnov & lazarian 2010 , beresnyak 2011 , 2013 ) , the issue of the actual nature of mhd turbulence requires further research for which observational techniques will play important role .",
    "indeed , the inertial range provided by astrophysical turbulence is much larger than that of numerical simulations .",
    "thus the synchrotron studies may be very useful for getting insight into the nature of mhd turbulence .",
    "the issues of the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations are important for turbulence theory and its implications , e.g. cosmic ray and heat propagation ( see brandenburg & lazarian 2013 ) . however , for describing many astrophysical processes , the issues of intensity of turbulent fluctuations , degree of turbulence compressibility , degree of magnetization of turbulence , injection and dissipation scales of turbulence are essential .",
    "in particular , interstellar medium is a very complex system and therefore one can not be a priori sure that simple models of isothermal turbulence can be directly applicable to its parts not to speak about the interstellar medium in general .",
    "additional physics , as well as multiple sources of energy injection can affect the shape of the turbulence spectrum and this makes obtaining the turbulence spectrum from observations essential .",
    "within our treatment we do not assume that the spectral index of magnetic fluctuations is @xmath25 , but treat it as a parameter that should be established from observations .",
    "all in all , the techniques that we propose in this paper are important for establishing ( a ) sources and sinks of turbulent energy , ( b ) the distribution of turbulence in galaxy and other astrophysical objects , ( c ) clarification of the properties of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "magnetic fields that are sampled by synchrotron polarization are turbulent .",
    "the prediction for the magnetic turbulence within the gs95 theory is the kolmogorov spectrum , which is in terms of 3d spectrum corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "note , when direction averaged , the spectrum gets another @xmath27 , which provides the usual value @xmath21 , which is a more common reference to the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we , however , will use in this paper , similar to our other publications ( see lp00 ) the 3d spectra .    at the same time , in some cases the spectrum of turbulence may be more shallow .",
    "this , for instance , corresponds to the magnetic field in the viscosity - damped turbulence , which is the high @xmath20 regime of turbulence in the fluid where the ratio of viscosity to resistivity is much larger than one ( cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002 , 2003 , lazarian , vishniac & cho 2004 ) .",
    "there it was shown that the one - dimensional spectrum can be @xmath28 which corresponds to the 3d spectrum of magnetic field of @xmath29 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath30 corresponded to the border - line spectrum of turbulence between the steep and shallow regimes ( see lp00 ) with shallow regime corresponding to most of the turbulent energy being at small scales , while the steep regime corresponds to most of the energy being at large scales .",
    "we are not aware of any expectations of the turbulent magnetic spectrum with the index more shallow than this borderline value .",
    "therefore we shall consider only _ steep _ magnetic field spectra .",
    "the fluctuations of synchrotron polarization are affected not only by magnetic perturbations , but also by faraday rotation fluctuations that are proportional to the product of the parallel to the line of sight component of magnetic field and density .",
    "shallow and steep spectra are , however , a confirmed reality of the spectrum of density in mhd turbulence ( see beresnyak , lazarian & cho 2005 , kowal , lazarian & beresnyak 2007 ) .",
    "the spectrum gets shallow as turbulence gets supersonic and more density fluctuations are localized in corrugated structures of shock - compressed gas .",
    "this regime in case of interstellar medium is relevant to cold phases of the medium , e.g. to molecular clouds ( see draine & lazarian 1998 for the list of the idealized phases ) , but localized ionization sources may result also in a shallow spectrum of random density . the warm interstellar medium",
    "responsible for the synchrotron radiation corresponds to transonic turbulence with mach number of the order of unity ( see burkhart , lazarian & gaensler 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , faraday rotation may take place in any media between the observer and the region of region of synchrotron emission , which may include cold high mach number turbulence .",
    "therefore , in our treatment we consider both shallow and steep spectra of turbulence .",
    "the anisotropy of the density correlations depends on the sonic mach number . in mhd turbulence at low mach numbers density",
    "follows the velocity scaling and exhibit gs95 type anisotropy , while at large mach numbers the density gets isotropic ( cho & lazarian 2003 , beresnyak et al .",
    "2005 , kowal et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this paper",
    "we will use only very general spectral properties of the rm correlations , while we continue elsewhere our studies of anisotropies ( see lazarian , esquivel & pogosyan 2001 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , 2009 , lazarian & pogosyan 2012 ) .    there can be processes that create correlations between the magnetic field and the density of thermal electrons .",
    "such correlations are possible for shocked regions .",
    "we consider such correlations .",
    "however , as we discuss further , the correlations of the vector , i.e. the line of sight component of magnetic field , and a scalar , i.e. thermal electron density are always zero .",
    "our assumption within the paper is that the squared perpendicular component of magnetic field and the density of cosmic rays are not correlated , as observations are indicative of more isotropic distribution of cosmic electrons .",
    "however , this is not a crucial assumption for our work , as we discuss below .",
    "mhd turbulence is more complex than the hydrodynamical one .",
    "magnetic field defines the preferred direction ( montgomery & turner 1981 , shebalin et al .",
    "1983 , higdon 1984 ) and the statistical properties of magnetized turbulence are anisotropic . for small scale motions this is true even in the absence of the mean magnetic field in the system .",
    "the local system of reference that , as we discussed earlier , is fundamental for modern theory of alfvnic turbulence ( see lazarian & vishniac 1999 , cho & vishniac 2000 , maron & godreich 2001 ) is not accessible to an observer who deals with projection of magnetic fields from the volume to the pictorial plane .",
    "the projection effects inevitably mask the actual direction of magnetic field within individual eddies along the line - of - sight .",
    "as the observer maps the projected magnetic field in the global reference frame , e.g. system of reference of the mean field , the anisotropy of eddies becomes _ scale - independent _ and the degree of anisotropy gets determined by the anisotropy of the largest eddies which projections are mapped ( cho et al . 2002 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 ) .    in the presence of the mean magnetic field in the volume under study",
    ", an observer will see anisotropic turbulence , where statistical properties of magnetic field differ in the directions orthogonal and parallel to the mean magnetic field that defines the symmetry axis .",
    "the description of axisymmetric turbulence was given by batchelor ( 1946 ) , chandrasekhar ( 1950 ) and later matthaeus & smith ( 1981 ) and oughton ( 1997 ) .",
    "this is the description that was employed in our earlier paper ( lp12 ) for the description of anisotropic fluctuations of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the index - symmetric part of the correlation tensor can then be presented in the following form : @xmath31 where the separation vector @xmath32 has the magnitude @xmath33 and the direction specified by the unit vector @xmath34 .",
    "the direction of the symmetry axis set by the mean magnetic field is given by the unit vector @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the magnetic field correlation tensor may also have antisymmetric , helical part ( see appendix  [ app : antisym ] ) .",
    "this part was not considered in lp12 as its contribution to synchrotron intensity fluctuations may be shown to be small . however , as we will discuss in the present paper , this part provides a very distinct response within the polarization studies that we discuss .",
    "therefore , while we do not dwell upon this part within this paper , we would like to stress , that , as we discuss below , with polarization correlations it is feasible to detect the helical part of the tensor .",
    "such a detection would be very important understanding of many problems of magnetic dynamo .",
    "the structure function of the field has the same representation @xmath37 with coefficients @xmath38 etc . in case of power - law spectra",
    ", one can use either the correlation function or the structure function , depending on the spectral slope . for the shallow spectrum it is natural to use the correlation function , while for steep one the structure function ( see e.g. lazarian & pogosyan 2004 ) . in this case",
    "the structure function coefficients can be thought of as renormalized correlation coefficients .",
    "magnetic field spectrum can be obtained by a fourier transform of correlation and structure functions of magnetic fields ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) .",
    "first we consider the case when statistics of the magnetic field is isotropic , which may , for instance , correspond to the super - alfvnic turbulence , i.e. for the turbulence with the injection velocity much in excess of the alfvnic one .",
    "the structure tensor of a gaussian isotropic vector field , a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dij ] ) , is usually written in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are structure functions that describe , respectively , the correlation of the vector components normal and orthogonal to point separation @xmath42 . in case of solenoidal vector field , in particular the magnetic field ,",
    "two structure functions are related by @xmath43 which in the regime of the power - law behaviour @xmath44 leads to both functions being proportional to each other @xmath45 .    from the point of view of observations , our considerations in  [ 2.1 ]",
    "suggest that the slope of the spectrum is not expected to change when the measurements are done in the system of reference of the mean magnetic field , which is the only system of reference available to the observer . therefore , if we are interested only in the crude description of turbulence , which includes the spectral slope and approximate measures of the injection / dissipation scales , to use the isotropic description of turbulence .",
    "this was the description that we adopted in our earlier papers dealing with velocity spectra ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 ) , but it is different from the description adopted for describing anisotropy of synchrotron fluctuations in lp12 .    potentially , our treatment of synchrotron fluctuations may be done for the case of relativistic electrons correlating with the strength of squared component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight . then the correlated quantities should be not @xmath46 , but @xmath47 .",
    "to characterize fluctuations of the synchrotron polarization one can use different combinations of stokes parameters ( see our discussion in lv12 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the complex measure of the linear polarization @xmath48 other combinations may have their advantages and should be discussed elsewhere .    in case of an extended synchrotron sources ,",
    "the polarization of the synchrotron emission at the source is characterized by the polarized intensity density @xmath49 , where @xmath50 marks the two - dimensional position of the source on a sky and @xmath51 is a line - of - sight distance . the polarized intensity detected by an observer in the direction @xmath50 at wavelength",
    "@xmath7 @xmath52 is a line - of - sight integral over emission at the sources modified by the faraday rotation of the polarization plane ( see brentjens & bruyn 2005 ) . here",
    "@xmath19 is the extent of the source along the line - of - sight and the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) is given by @xmath53 where @xmath9 is the density of thermal electrons in @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the strength of the parallel to the line - of - sight component of magnetic field in @xmath56gauss , and the radial distance is in @xmath57 .    in general , synchrotron emission intensity depends on the wavelength @xmath7 , as discussed in appendix  [ app : basics ] . in this study",
    "we consider the polarization measure @xmath58 in which this dependence has been scaled out .",
    "this can be accomplished , for instance , by determining the mean wavelength scaling from the total intensity measurements . with such rescaling , polarization at the source @xmath59",
    "is treated as wavelength independent , while the observed @xmath60 contains the residual wavelength dependence due to faraday rotation only .",
    "while faraday rotation reflects the line - of - sight @xmath61 component of the magnetic field , the intrinsic synchrotron emission at the source is determined locally by its transverse , @xmath62 , part ( see   [ app : basics ] ) .",
    "clearly both polarization at the source and faraday rotation influence the observed signal .",
    "this makes the analysis of polarization fluctuations much more complicated compared to pure intensity that we studied in lp12 .",
    "let us write the faraday rotation measure as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the rm per unit length along the line - of - sight .",
    "electron density @xmath9 , the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field @xmath65 and , correspondingly , @xmath66 are spatially local quantities which we assume to be statistically homogeneous .",
    "both density and magnetic field can be presented as a sum of the mean value and a fluctuation .",
    "therefore , the average value of the rm linear density is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are zero mean fluctuations of the electron density and the magnetic field .",
    "note that these fluctuations taken at the same point are generally uncorrelated due to the vector nature of the magnetic field and the symmetry under the local reversal of its direction .",
    "thus , it is just the product of the mean @xmath70 that defines the mean rm density .",
    "the variance of fluctuations in faraday rm density is @xmath71 correlation properties of the rm density at two points in space are described by the correlation or structure functions @xmath72 assumption of statistical homogeneity of the medium is reflected in the fact that @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend only on the coordinate difference between the two positions . in what follows",
    "we illustrate our treatment of the problem using power - law correlation model @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the scaling slope and @xmath77 is the correlation length of rm density , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these expressions are not the most general expressions for the correlations in the magnetic field ( compare with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xi_ij]),([eq : dij ] ) ) , but they are adequate if we discuss measuring the scaling properties .",

    "this was shown in lp12 to result in anisotropies of synchrotron fluctuations .",
    "if we compare the expression for intensity in eq.([i ] ) and polarized intensity eq.([p ] ) we observed that the fluctuations of the perpendicular component of magnetic field enter the same way in both expressions , i.e. they are both proportional to @xmath475 .",
    "the difference arises from the fact that the expression for the polarization has the faraday phase factor . in terms of correlation properties ,",
    "this factor , as our analysis above shows , in most cases results in introduction of the window which limits the extent of the region from which the signal is collected .",
    "thus the analysis of anisotropy of synchrotron fluctuations in lp12 is applicable to the correlation functions of the polarized radiation with the caveat that the magnetic field studied this way is not the magnetic field integrated over the line - of - sight through the entire emitting region , but limited by the zone extent of which determined by the faraday window that we discussed in  [ sec : samelambda ] .",
    "this provides a few new effects which are very valuable for magnetic field studies .",
    "the analysis of anisotropies in lp12 suggested that the mean magnetic field direction in the entire synchrotron -emitting region can be obtained from the analysis of the quadrupole anisotropy of the synchrotron fluctuations . in view of our earlier discussion",

    "it is possible to see that the same analysis can be extended to obtain the variations of the corresponding strengths along the line - of - sight if polarized synchrotron emission is used for the cases when the faraday rotation does not impose the fluctuations of its own .",
    "the latter corresponds to the limited parameter space ( see left upper part of table  [ tab : mainresults ] ) . in that",
    "special situation the analysis in lp12 should be extended .",
    "a particular case of anisotropy analysis considered in lp12 is the case of studying anisotropies within the milky way when the observer is submerged in the emitting synchrotron volume .",
    "it was shown there that if the angle @xmath476 between the lines - of - sight along which the synchrotron intensity is collected is sufficiently large , i.e. @xmath476 is much larger than the ratio of the correlation radius of magnetic fluctuations @xmath148 to the extent of the emitting volume @xmath19 , then the anisotropy analysis samples correlations of magnetic field only to the extent @xmath477 , which allows determining magnetic field direction variations within the emitting volume .",
    "it is easy to see that the polarization substantially extends this ability of sampling magnetic field and allows studying variations of magnetic field at scales less than @xmath148 .",
    "the direction of magnetic field that obtained by the correlation anisotropy analysis in lp12 will not coincide , in general , with the direction given by the mean polarization .",
    "this arises from the fact that the magnetic eddies tend to get elongated along the mean field .",
    "the latter direction is fixed in space and not affected , unlike the synchrotron polarization direction , by faraday rotation .",
    "a comparison of the direction provided by the statistical technique above and the direction of mean polarization can provide an estimate of the mean angle of faraday rotation for the polarized radiation .    the suggested in lp12 technique of multipole decomposition of the synchrotron radiation potentially opens ways to disentangling the contributions from compressible and incompressible motions .",
    "the spectral analysis of the fluctuations of the multipoles obtained as a result of such a decomposition opens an avenue for studies of spectra of magnetic fluctuations corresponding to compressible and incompressible motions separately . in lp12 we assumed that for our study we use single dish data or , equivalently , the interferometric data with the full coverage of spatial frequencies . within this paper",
    "we explored a possibility of studying synchrotron with sparsely sampled interferometric data .",
    "we feel that such a data can be used within the multipole decomposition technique .",
    "we plan to elaborate the corresponding procedures elsewhere .",
    "this paper is the first attempt , as far as we know , to provide the detailed statistical properties of position - position - frequency ( ppf ) data cubes of polarization data in order to study properties of underlying magnetic turbulence .",
    "synchrotron emission is pretty complex and this probably kept theorists off the subject .",
    "for instance , its properties depend on the index of cosmic rays , as a result the intensities of both polarized and unpolarized emission depend on @xmath478 , where @xmath479 is the amplitude of magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight and @xmath138 is related to the spectral index of cosmic rays as it is discussed in appendix a.    this paper continues our study of the statistics of synchrotron radiation that we started in lp12 .",
    "there we obtained the two point statistics of synchrotron intensities for arbitrary @xmath138 . in this paper",
    "we utilized this advance to describe the statistics of polarization in the presence of faraday rotation . as a result , our results are applicable to a variety of situations characterized by different @xmath138 .",
    "in lp12 we showed that the spectrum of magnetic turbulence within entire synchrotron emitting volume can be determined from synchrotron fluctuations for an arbitrary @xmath138 .",
    "the use of polarized fluctuations gives us a possibility to vary the extent of the volume under study .",
    "indeed , we have seen in the previous sections that the faraday rotation effect limits the extent of the region where magnetic fluctuations are being sampled .",
    "an important finding of the present study is that we found the situations when the correlations of the polarization have imaginary parts . in other words",
    ", we found that the real part of the polarization correlations , i.e. @xmath480 provides the information about the symmetric turbulence of magnetic field and electron density fluctuations , while the imaginary part , i.e. @xmath481 is may not be zero and can deliver very valuable information about properties of magnetic field and turbulence .",
    "for the most part of the paper we concentrate on the real part of polarization correlations , while we briefly discuss that the non - zero imaginary part can inform us about the 3d direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we note that for the practical analysis of the data one can use the expression @xmath480 to make sure that the antisymmetric part does not contribute to the signal . in fact , this is the expression that one should identify with the analysis of the correlation of fluctuations of polarization that we discussed in the paper . alternatively ,",
    "as we discussed earlier , one can use structure functions of the polarization rather than the correlation functions .",
    "finding that the combination @xmath481 differs from zero in observations will be an important discovery .",
    "depending on the dominant origin of the antisymmetry one can get insight either into the 3d direction of magnetic field in the emitting volume .",
    "naturally , there are different ways of studying fluctuations of polarization . in the present paper",
    "we have provided a detailed description of the study of the spatial correlations or polarization measures in spatially separated points @xmath482 for the same wavelength and the frequency variations of the dispersion of the polarization @xmath483 .",
    "the technique utilizing the former measure we termed polarization spatial analysis ( psa ) and utilizing the latter measure polarization variance analysis ( pva ) .",
    "table  [ tab : mainresults ] illustrates different regimes of turbulence study that are available with the above techniques .",
    "this table also reflects the richness of the ppf data in terms of various scales that are involved and which can be recovered by the analysis of the polarization data ( see also table 1 where these scales are listed ) .",
    "the variety of the scales involved arises from the fact that the resulting polarization is the outcome of both polarization of synchrotron emission collected along the line of sight and the faraday rotation of the polarization plane . in the main text of the paper we assumed that the emission and faraday rotation happen within the same volume",
    "this is the most complex from the mathematical point of view situation .",
    "we consider another limiting case of separate regions of emission and faraday rotation in appendix c. naturally , the intermediate cases can be presented as a superposition of these two limiting cases .    with astrophysical environments presenting us with a rich variety of different circumstances ,",
    "we consider both the situation when most of faraday rotation arises due to the turbulent field and to the mean field .",
    "the former case corresponds to turbulent decorrelation scale @xmath484 given by eq .",

    "this provides one with an opportunity to sample different volumes along the lines and use synchrotron polarization fluctuations to get unique insight into the distribution of magnetic fields and magnetic turbulence and different distances from the observer .",
    "this is the unique feature of using polarized synchrotron emission .",
    "we deal at length with psa and pva techniques , as we view them as the simplest techniques involving synchrotron polarization data . at the same time",
    ", our approach is not limited to these two techniques .",
    "in fact , we also applied our approach to find a few more useful statistical measure that we discuss in the paper .",
    "if we talk about the psa we have several regimes .",

    "( [ eq : xi_sync_larger ] ) which happens as the line separation @xmath108 becomes comparable with the correlation scale @xmath490 we can get the characteristic size of the faraday rotation fluctuations .",
    "in other regimes shown in table  [ tab : mainresults ] one can obtain @xmath491 , i.e. to obtain the statistics of magnetic field , which is not distorted by the faraday rotation fluctuations . combining that with the result obtained in the regime in the upper left corner of table  [ tab : mainresults ]",
    ", one can obtain also the spectral properties of the faraday rotation fluctuations , e.g. the spectral index @xmath489 .",
    "depending on the media the fluctuations of @xmath486 can be dominated either by electron density fluctuations or the parallel to line - of - sight component of magnetic field fluctuations . in many situations the fluctuations of magnetic field and electron density are not correlated and therefore the correlation is factorized , i.e. can be presented as a product of the electron density and magnetic field correlations .",
    "if magnetic field statistics is known through the measurements of @xmath488 as we discussed above , then in the case of no density - magnetic field correlations one can get the correlation function of electron density .",
    "another feature that is obvious from the analysis of table  [ tab : mainresults ] is that , apart from @xmath490 , measuring of which we discussed above , we get an opportunity to obtain the characteristic correlation scales of the magnetic field @xmath148 . if within psa we observe at a given wavelength two regimes depending on the line - of - sight separation , then we can increase the wavelength and suppress the regime influenced by the faraday rotation fluctuations ( see upper left corner of table  [ tab : mainresults ] ) .",
    "the transition will happen at @xmath492 , which presents an interesting way to determine the correlation length of the magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "in short , when magnetic field fluctuations dominate the faraday rotation measure and in the case of no assumption of magnetic field and electron density correlation the psa provides the correlation function of magnetic field and a correlation function of electron density product with magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is not correlated with electron density one gets separately the correlation functions of magnetic field and electron density .",
    "the observations of the change of the polarization fluctuation slopes provide also the scales @xmath490 and @xmath148 . in addition , by exploring the very fact that there is a change of the scalings of the polarization fluctuations ( compare upper and lower lines of the left corner of table  [ tab : mainresults ] ) allows to establish whether the magnetic fluctuations or regular magnetic field dominate the faraday effect .",
    "if the faraday rotation is dominated by the regular magnetic rotation , then we have only one regime of study and all the fluctuations naturally arise from the fluctuations of the perpendicular component of magnetic field .    for the pfa ,",
    "which is complementary to the psa technique , table  [ tab : mainresults ] illustrates that the relative effect of the ratio of the mean faraday measure to its dispersion results in rather conspicuous consequences .",
    "indeed , the universal scaling of the variance as @xmath306 for long @xmath7 testifies that the faraday dispersion measure dominates the regular faraday rotation . to find the underlying magnetic field spectral slope one has to differentiate the variance as it suggested by eq .",

    "the analytical description of synchrotron fluctuations in lp12 and the present study provides an opportunity to describe synchrotron statistics for complex astrophysical situations when the emitting regions and the regions of faraday rotation are inhomogeneous in space , magnetic field changes in the direction in respect to the line of sight .",
    "this is very important for the analysis of galactic and extragalactic synchrotron sources as well as for predicting the statistical properties of synchrotron foregrounds within cmb studies .",
    "our study is focused on obtaining turbulent spectra both of magnetic field and of faraday rotation . while studying astrophysical turbulence one should take into account that the properties of turbulence may change along the line of sight and averaged rather than local properties of turbulence are available .",
    "this , however , did not prevent substantial progress in the studies of turbulent densities and velocities , as we discuss in the paper .",
    "similarly , magnetic turbulence was also studied successfully using synchrotron intensity fluctuations ( see lp12 and ref . therein ) .",
    "we would like to mention , however , that in terms of sampling local properties of magnetic turbulence and getting homogeneous in the statistical sense sample the suggested techniques employing synchrotron polarization have an unquestionable advantage .",
    "indeed , using the faraday rotation depolarization it is possible to limit the extent of the regions that contribute to the signal .",
    "this allows more localized studies of turbulence and also mitigates the problem of the sample inhomogeneity .",
    "in our derivations we used the assumption of magnetic fields being gaussian .",
    "our recent numerical study ( herron et al . 2015 ) confirms that even for high mach number turbulence the magnetic fields preserve gaussian properties , which is reflected through the skewness and kurtosis calculations .",
    "the last comment is that while the full statistical description of magnetic fields requires the use of anisotropic tensors presented in ",
    "[ subsec : bfieldstat ] , for the limited purpose of obtaining the spectral slope of magnetic turbulence spectrum , the simplified description of turbulence that we adopted for the most part of this paper is adequate .      for the most of the paper we consider a homogeneous volume filled with turbulent magnetic fields , relativistic electrons and turbulent thermal plasmas .",
    "we also consider in the appendix a particular case when the thermal plasmas and the volume of synchrotron emission are separated in space . in reality",
    ", the actual picture may be a combination of the two cases .    in the present problem of studying magnetic turbulence with synchrotron polarization",
    "there are several parameters , the characteristic length of faraday rotation arising from the mean field @xmath509 , the characteristic scale of faraday rotation arising from the random field @xmath510 , the correlation scale of emitting synchrotron magnetic structures @xmath148 , the correlation scale of the faraday rotation fluctuations @xmath77 .",
    "separation between the lines - of - sight @xmath511 and the size of the emitting region along the line - of - sight @xmath19 . both @xmath509 and @xmath510",
    "are proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , by changing the wavelength @xmath7 is it possible to make these sizes larger or smaller than other sizes involved in the problem . as we discussed earlier , ability to vary @xmath7 allows to study separately the statistics of fluctuations that arise from the faraday rotation and arising from variations of perpendicular component of magnetic field @xmath474 responsible for synchrotron polarized emissivity .    to see correlations of synchrotron polarization",
    "it is most productive to make the measurements at @xmath512 , as no appreciable correlations is expected when the sampling of independent eddies is involved .",
    "we also assumed that the thickness of emitting physical volume along the line - of - sight @xmath19 is much larger than the separation between the lines - of - sight @xmath108 .",
    "this is a natural assumption for studying 3d turbulent volumes . in some particular situations of studying turbulence in thin emitting synchrotron shells ,",
    "the turbulence can be essentially 2d .",
    "for such special cases our analysis can be modified accordingly .    in many cases",
    "it is natural to assume that the correlation scale of faraday rotation fluctuations @xmath490 should be smaller than the correlation scale of the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath148 .",
    "this is natural if fluctuations of electron density are short correlated .",
    "however , there was no particular assumption for the relation between @xmath148 and @xmath490 involved in our derivations .    in some astrophysical settings",
    "another parameter related to the optical depth for self - absorption of synchrotron is appropriate .",
    "however , in the present study we disregard the effect of self - absorption .",
    "this effect will be studied elsewhere .",
    "all the papers on synchrotron spectra determination ( see  [ sec : introduction ] ) prior the lp12 study used the simplifying assumption of synchrotron emissivity being proportional to the perpendicular component of magnetic field squared .",
    "this meant that the solution was suitable only for a single value of the relativistic electron spectral index .",
    "in general , synchrotron emissivity is proportional to @xmath513 with @xmath138 varying within astrophysical objects and also varying with the frequency of synchrotron radiation .",
    "this limitation was a serious constraint for the statistical studies and it was overcome in lp12 .",
    "our present study employs the foundations established in lp12 .",
    "indeed , studying intensities as in lp12 we demonstrated that one can obtain the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations as well as the direction of the mean magnetic field along the line - of - sight .",
    "we also showed that one can find the relative importance of compressible and incompressible modes within magnetic turbulence .",
    "intensities is the simplest emission property to study through observations and it is remarkable that a lot of information can be obtained even using synchrotron intensities alone . the polarization that we deal with in the present paper is a more sophisticated measure .",
    "the expressions for the synchrotron polarization are affected by faraday rotation and the resulting statistics reflects both magnetic and electron density fluctuations .",
    "naturally , for sufficiently small @xmath7 we are getting expressions which are not affected by the faraday rotation and the expressions for polarization become similar to those of intensity .    in terms of the analysis of the observational signal we can list a few advantages of using the polarization statistics we employ here compared to that of intensity .",
    "the most obvious advantage of the present approach is that we get another parameter that we can vary , namely , the wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "this makes the study much more informative as we discuss in  [ sec : lineofsight ] and  [ sec : additionalways ] .",
    "additional information should be available by fitting of the model of turbulence with its injection and dissipation scales as it is done in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2015 ) for the case of spectral line data .",
    "for obtaining the spectral slope of turbulence the wavelength information can increase the reliability of the measurement .",
    "the predicted dependence on @xmath7 is not the only advantage of using polarimetric data compared to pure intensity .",
    "the synchrotron radiation is strongly polarized and therefore polarization provides additional way to separate it from unpolarized diffuse radiation , e.g. from the free - free plasma emission .",
    "this is important , for instance , in the context of separating foregrounds in cosmic microwave background studies .",
    "in addition , as we discussed above , the advantage of using ppf data cubes is the ability of tomographic study of turbulence that the use of polarization allows . as we have demonstrated in the paper , the polarization signal is being collected from the distances limited by the faraday depolarization effect .",
    "this allows studying turbulence at different distances from the observer .",
    "last , but not the least is that our study reveals the possibility of studying magnetic turbulence using wavelength information for the measurements taken along the same line - of - sight .",
    "this ability is absent for absent for the intensity data .",
    "our work shows the dependence on the cosmic ray spectral index affects the the polarization measures the same way that it depends intensity in enlin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are consistent with our theoretical finding . ] .",
    "we believe that our approach presents a way to extend the results to the measures that other authors ( e.g. enlin et al .",
    "2010 ) employed in the assumption of @xmath146 , e.g. the way to determine the `` power spectrum of the magnetic tension force '' ( enlin et al . 2010 ) and other magnetic field statistical measures that can be obtained with synchrotron stokes measures .",
    "exploring these possibilities deserves a separate study .",
    "this study provides a new approach to studies of turbulent magnetic fields . we should stress that attempts to recover statistical information about the structure of turbulent magnetic fields in the icm from the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) data ( enlin & vogt 2003 ; vogt & enlin 2003 , 2005 ; govoni et al .",
    "2006 ; guidetti et al . 2008 ) , as well as studies of the ism ( haverkorn et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , and the works based on polarized synchrotron emission data ( spangler 1982 , 1983 , eilek 1989a , b ) can be repeated on the basis of the detailed statistical description of synchrotron polarization that we presented in lp12 and this study .",
    "our present paper presents the description of the statistics of synchrotron fluctuations in the ppf space . the corresponding description of the statistics of spectral line fluctuations in the position - position - velocity ( ppv ) space was provided in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , 2006 ) .",
    "we see both similarities and differences of the aforementioned statistics .",
    "we can observe that while the ppv statistics is strongly influenced by both the fluctuations of density and velocity , the statistics of fluctuation in the ppf arise from the fluctuations of magnetic field and those in faraday rotation .",
    "the latter is affected by the product of electron density and parallel component of magnetic field .",
    "thus in both cases we deal with a signal that is affected by different turbulent fields .    at the same time , the properties of ppf and ppv data cubes are different . in ppv cubes",
    "we could separate the contributions from velocity and density by changing the thickness of the frequency intervals over which we sampled the cube , i.e. by changing the thickness of velocity slices . in ppf cubes , for a given spatial separation of the correlated points , the low frequency part of ppf depending on the regime ( see table  [ tab : mainresults ] ) is dominated by both the faraday rotation fluctuations and fluctuations of magnetic field or just fluctuations of magnetic field , while the higher frequency part of ppf cube arises from only magnetic fluctuations .",
    "in other words , the ways of extracting statistical information from ppv and ppf are different . by studying ppf at sufficiently high frequencies",
    "the information about @xmath1 can be obtained , which if combined with the statistics at low frequencies provides the information about @xmath514 .",
    "important difference between the ppv and ppf statistics is that ppv statistics is homogeneous in the velocity direction , while ppf statistics is strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "this provides additional information about turbulent volumes .",
    "for instance , changing the wavelength it is possible to explore regions at different distances from the observer .",
    "this is a capability not available with ppv data cubes .",
    "in addition , anisotropy in ppf results in additional effects unique for this space , e.g. in the imaginary part of correlations as it is discussed in  [ subsec : antisym ] .",
    "integration over a range of frequencies , or frequency resolution play an important role for vca , but it is not so important within the psa if the range of frequencies is within one of the distant regimes of @xmath514 or @xmath1 integration ( see figure [ fig : wl ] ) .",
    "if , however , the power is integrated over the frequencies includes the range of the transition from one asymptotic regime to another , the resulting behavior will not reflect any of the asymptotics .",
    "our pfa technique can be considered as the analog of the vcs technique that we developed for the ppv space . similarly to vcs , this technique does not use spatial information to get the statistics of turbulence .",
    "therefore , we expect that , similar to the vcs , the new technique can get the statistics of turbulence using measurements just along 5 - 10 lines - of - sight",
    ". the latter was established numerically in chepurnov & lazarian ( 2010 ) .    in the paper",
    "we were focused on the asymptotic regimes . in this respect",
    "our study follows the theoretical approach in our papers dealing with obtaining velocity turbulence using doppler shifted spectroscopic data ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , we also obtained general expressions for the synchrotron polarization in the presence of faraday rotation .",
    "our corresponding general expressions obtained for the spectroscopic data were used in the study of chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to provide a detailed description of turbulence , including in particular , studying hi emission with galfa data chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) provided not only slopes of the underlying velocity and density fluctuations , but also the injection scale and other parameters .",
    "the fruitfulness of such an approach was shown in the subsequent study by chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2015 ) that revealed that the corresponding properties of turbulence in small magellanic cloud are rather different from those in our galaxy .",
    "we feel that a similar approach can be fruitful within our new technique synchrotron polarization technique described in the present paper .",
    "the fact that the expression for synchrotron intensity depends on the spectral index of cosmic rays has been an impediment for the quantitative studies of the statistics of synchrotron variations .",
    "our study shows that cosmic ray spectral variations change only the amplitude of the polarization fluctuation that we discussed . as varying @xmath7 allows to sample synchrotron emitting regions to different depths , we may encounter the variations of spectral index in the sampled regions .",
    "then the use the correction factors from lp12 can be employed , if necessary .",
    "our study has been performed in the assumption of no magnetic field correlation with the density of relativistic electrons .",
    "this assumption corresponds to observation of much smoother distribution of relativistic electrons compared to the distribution of magnetic fields in the milky way .",
    "our formalism , however , may be extended for the case of relativistic electrons correlated with magnetic fields .",
    "we do not expect substantial changes in our present conclusions , e.g. in the dependence of synchrotron intensity spectrum on @xmath138 .      with the enhanced resolution of the synchrotron data available it is possible to apply our techniques not only to milky way , but also to extragalactic sources , e.g. to nearby galaxies and radio lobes of radio galaxies .",
    "for such extragalactic applications , the synchrotron radiation and faraday rotation of milky way acts as a foreground . incidentally , the usage of the raw interferometric data in order to obtain turbulent spectra is most advantageous for this application as getting turbulence spectra would not require full spectral frequency coverage .",
    "for the two techniques the milky way foreground acts differently .",
    "it is influence is strongest to the pfa one as the information is collected along a single line - of - sight . for the psa ,",
    "if the angular extent of the synchrotron source is relatively small , then the influence of the milky way amounts to essentially constant along both lines - of - sight faraday rotation and synchrotron polarization intensity .",
    "those should not interfere with the analysis . as a result",
    "we expect that the technique can study the distribution of turbulence in extragalactic sources .",
    "for the turbulence anisotropy analysis the variations of the milky way polarization for the beams separated at distances much smaller than @xmath148 are expected to be small . therefore the variations are expected to arise mostly from an extragalactic source and the anisotropy analysis should reveal the magnetic field and its variations within the source .",
    "galactic data synchrotron emission presents a natural object for studying with the new technique .",
    "however , the technique can be used to measure the statistics of distant objects , e.g. external galaxies and clusters of galaxies as the resolution of instruments increases .",
    "magnetic fluctuations that are available through the study of psa and psf techniques described above are very important for understanding both the fundamental properties of mhd turbulence and its influence on key astrophysical processes , e.g. star formation ( see mckee & ostriker 2007 ) and cosmic ray propagation ( see schlickeiser 2002 , yan & lazarian 2008 ) , as well as for the mapping of the sources and sinks of turbulent energy .",
    "the synchrotron fluctuations deliver the information on magnetic fluctuations , which is complementary to the velocity statistics that is available by other techniques .",
    "the currently alternative way of studying magnetic fluctuations is through using dust polarization signal , which is a technique that is limited by our the ability of dust grains to follow magnetic fields and the uncertainties of the grain alignment theory ( see lazarian 2007 for a review ) .",
    "the vca and the vcs techniques that we developed for the analysis of the velocity fluctuations provide the statistics of velocity fluctuations . in mhd turbulence , the velocity and magnetic field statistics are related and therefore the simultaneous use of the two measures is advantageous .",
    "in addition , the measures may be very complementary , as spectral lines and velocities may sample different regions along the line - of - sight .    in general , in the presence of the complex , inhomogeneous ism",
    "it is really advantageous to use complementary statistical measures which can provide a better insight into the complexity of the turbulence . thus combining velocity and magnetic field",
    "is synergetic .",
    "in addition to velocity that we can obtain with e.g. vca and vcs techniques we can use the statistics of density .",
    "those can be obtained using some of the new techniques that have been developed recently .",
    "those include the analysis of moments of the density probabilities ( kowal et al .",
    "2007 , burkhart et al . 2009 , 2010 ) , tsallis statistics ( esquivel & lazarian 2010 , tauffmire et al .",

    "2008 , burkhart et al .",

    "apart for analyzing the density , the aforementioned techniques can be applied to the synchrotron emission distributions .",

    "( 2012 ) used kurtosis , skewness and genus of the polarized intensity gradient distribution to establish the mach number of turbulence .",
    "such work provides complementary information about the properties of magnetic turbulence under study .",
    "we note that the general formalism describing fluctuations of polarization that we developed in this paper can be modified for study spectra of gradients of polarization and the anisotropy of the gradients of polarization .",

    "( 2011 ) .",
    "the techniques described above outline new ways of studying anisotropic astrophysical magnetic turbulence both in milky way and beyond .",
    "the injection and dissipation scales as well as spectral slope of magnetic turbulence provide keys to addressing many problems of turbulence .",
    "these properties are necessary for studying cosmic ray transport and cosmic ray acceleration , as well as studying heat and mass transport in astrophysical environments . in addition , studies of turbulence anisotropy open ways for studying turbulence compressibility . combined with statistical studies of density and velocity ,",
    "the new techniques allow ways to identify sources of turbulence in different phases of interstellar media over the range of scales from kiloparsecs to astronomical units .",
    "the corresponding knowledge is necessary for a wide range of subjects from star formation to interstellar chemistry .",
    "we note , that the interest to properties of magnetic turbulence in milky way also arises from its role of inducing fluctuations of foreground radiation .",
    "in particular , we discussed potential ways of removing foregrounds if the spectrum of turbulence is known .",
    "the application of such an approach for cmb data is discussed in cho & lazarian ( 2010 ) and for high redshifted atomic hydrogen emission in cho , lazarian & timbie ( 2012 ) .",
    "last but not the least , the information about turbulence obtained through observations is important for understanding of the enigmatic nature of mhd turbulence .",
    "the present paper presents the first to our knowledge detailed statistical description of the synchrotron polarization fluctuations .",
    "it capitalizes on our study in lp12 , which provided the description of fluctuations for an arbitrary index of cosmic rays .",
    "however , this work does not address all the questions .",
    "while it provides analytical expressions of the different regimes of the psa and pfa studies , it explores analytically only one regime of turbulence study within the faraday rotation synthesis .",
    "naturally , the corresponding work should be extended .",
    "we have noticed in the present paper that the helical correlations should result in distinct signature , making the correlation function of polarization ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrpfluct ] ) complex .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ eq : corrpfluct ] ) contains the valuable information about 3d direction of magnetic field and therefore this term deserves a separate theoretical study .",
    "the effects of self - adsorption is neglected within our treatment .",
    "this effect may be important for some data sets and also should be accounted for in future .",
    "our experience with ppv data cubes in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2004 ) show that absorption can substantially change the observed statistics .",
    "fortunately , effects of self absorption are less common in synchrotron compared to the spectroscopic data .",
    "motivated by the richness of the synchrotron data available with operating telescopes and the prospects of higher resolution and sensitivity that is going to be available for synchrotron observations in the near future , we proceed with our studies of synchrotron fluctuations our present study capitalizes on our previous investigation in lp12 , which established the way to describe synchrotron fluctuations for the arbitrary index of cosmic ray spectrum . unlike the lp12 it is aimed on using synchrotron polarization rather than intensity .",
    "synchrotron polarization fluctuations carry information both about the statistics of random magnetic field perpendicular to the line - of - sight as well as of the fluctuations of the product of the electron density and the parallel component of magnetic field . obtaining these statistics from the statistics of synchrotron polarization fluctuations",
    "was our goal in the paper . within the assumptions discussed throughout the paper we have obtained analytical results which can be briefly summarized in the following way :    * we provided an analytical description of the statistics of synchrotron polarization fluctuations within position - position - frequency ( ppf ) data cubes and employed this description to develop two complementary techniques to study the spectra of the underlying fluctuations of magnetic field and electron density .",
    "* the first technique that we termed polarization spatial analysis ( psa ) employs the correlations of the polarization intensities measured at the same frequency . at high frequencies it samples @xmath1 fluctuation , while at lower frequencies the technique is also sensitive to the fluctuations of @xmath486 measure , provided that these fluctuations dominate faraday rotation arising from the regular field .",
    "we find that the psa is a powerful technique that can provide the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations , the slope of faraday rotation fluctuations , the correlation scale of faraday rotation fluctuations , the correlations scale or magnetic turbulence fluctuations as well as to give insight into the ratio of the regular and random magnetic fields . * the second technique that we termed polarization frequency analysis ( pfa )",
    "employs the change of the variance of polarization with frequency .",
    "the properties of the variance as a function of frequency were found to depend on whether the rotation measure is dominated by the regular faraday rotation arising from the mean field or the faraday rotation is dominated by @xmath486 fluctuations . in the former case",
    "the dependence of the variance of polarization on frequency reflects the statistics of @xmath1 . in the latter case",
    "the variance of polarization exhibits a universal asymptotic but we suggest a measure that uses the derivative of the variance and which reflects the @xmath1 statistics . by studying the change of the slope one also can determine the correlation length of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "* polarization fluctuation are predicted to exhibit anisotropy that arises from the mhd turbulence anisotropy .",
    "the technique for such a study is similar to the one in lp12 but has the advantage that the sampling distance along the lines - of - sight can be controlled by changing the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "this allows to study the variations of the regular magnetic field along the line - of - sight . *",
    "the imaginary part of the correlation functions of polarization contains the information about the 3d direction of mean magnetic field , which is a very valuable information to be obtained from the ppf studies . *",
    "our analysis of the effects of the spatial and frequency resolution of the telescopes provides the criteria for the averaging that the finite resolution involves not to distort the results obtained with the techniques .",
    "* we introduced a new measure of polarization statistics @xmath515 which we found is more sensitive to faraday rotation and therefore is complementary to the polarization correlations used with psa technique . *",

    "the origin of nonlinearity is in relativistic effects .",
    "nonlinearity comes from the fact that the signal is formed only over the narrow fraction of the electron cycle , and the two leading orders in the deviation of the trajectory from the straight line give the same contribution in terms of the inverse of the lorentz factor @xmath517 .",
