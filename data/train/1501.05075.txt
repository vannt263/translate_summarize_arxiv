    "before its complete proof by andrew wiles , a major result for the first case of fermat s last theorem ( flt ) , that is , the assertion of the impossibility of @xmath3 in integers @xmath4 , none of which is divisible by a prime @xmath5 , was the 1909 theorem of wieferich @xcite that the exponent @xmath0 must satisfy the congruence    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is known as the fermat quotient of @xmath0 , base 2 .",
    "this celebrated result was to be generalized in many directions .",
    "one of these was the extension of the congruence to bases other than 2 , the first such step being the proof of an analogous theorem for the base 3 by mirimanoff @xcite in 1910 .",
    "another grew from the recognition that some of these criteria could be framed in terms of certain special harmonic numbers of the form    @xmath8    for @xmath2 , and with @xmath9 denoting the greatest - integer function .",
    "there are nice historical overviews of these developments in @xcite and @xcite ( pp .  15559 ) , which go into greater detail than we attempt here .      at the time when wieferich s and mirimanoff s results appeared",
    ", it was already known that three of these harmonic numbers had close connections to the fermat quotient , and satisfied the following congruences ( all modulo @xmath0 ) :    @xmath10    all these results are due to glaisher ; those for @xmath11 = 2 and 4 will be found in ( @xcite , pp .",
    "21 - 22 , 23 ) , and that for @xmath11 = 3 in ( @xcite , p.  50 ) .",
    "although it was not the next harmonic number criterion published , it will be convenient to dispense next with the case @xmath11 = 6 .",
    "the apparatus needed to evaluate this harmonic number appears in a 1905 paper of lerch ( @xcite , p.  476 , equations 14 and 15 ) , but the implications of lerch s result were long overlooked , and only realized in 1938 by emma lehmer ( @xcite , pp .",
    "356ff ) , who gave the following congruence mod @xmath0 :    @xmath12    the fact that the vanishing of @xmath13 mod @xmath0 is a necessary condition for the failure of the first case of flt for the exponent @xmath0 is an immediate consequence of the theorems of wieferich and mirimanoff . in the present study ,",
    "we use lehmer s congruence in the equivalent form    @xmath14    obtained from ( [ eq : p6a ] ) by applying in reverse the logarithmetic and factorization rules for the fermat quotient given by eisenstein @xcite .",
    "this expression reveals that divisors @xmath0 of @xmath13 are instances of the vanishing of the fermat quotient mod @xmath0 for composite bases , a problem which has notably been studied in the ongoing work of richard fischer @xcite .",
    "the four congruences above exhaust the cases of @xmath1 that can be evaluated solely in terms of fermat quotients .",
    "historically , the case @xmath11 = 5 also has its origins in this era , and was in fact introduced before that of @xmath11 = 6 . in 1914 , vandiver @xcite proved that the vanishing of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are necessary conditions for @xmath0 to be an exception to the first case of flt . unlike the four cases already considered , here the connection of the harmonic number with flt was discovered before any evaluation of it ( beyond the definitional one ) was known .",
    "it was almost eighty years later that the connection between these results would become apparent .",
    "the ingredients needed for the evaluation of this harmonic number were presented in a 1991 paper by williams ( @xcite , p.  440 ) , and almost simultaneously by z.h .",
    "sun ( @xcite , pt .  3 , theorems 3.1 and 3.2 ) ; and though they do not write out the formula explicitly , it is clearly implied to be    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the fibonacci quotient ( oeis a092330 ) , with @xmath19 a fibonacci number and @xmath20 a jacobi symbol . in light of vandiver s theorems on @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", this result immediately established that the vanishing of the fibonacci quotient mod @xmath0 was yet another criterion for the failure of the first case of flt for the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the fact was announced almost immediately in the celebrated paper by the sun brothers @xcite , which gave fresh impetus to an already vast literature on the fibonacci quotient ; and in its honor the primes @xmath0 which divide their fibonacci quotient were named wall - sun - sun - primes .",
    "these remain hypothetical , as not a single instance has been found despite tests to high limits @xcite .",
    "the remaining known formulae for the type of special harmonic numbers in which we are interested are of much more recent origin . in some cases",
    "they were discovered simultaneously , or nearly so , by more than one researcher ; and we hope we have not done injustice to any of the participants . apart from a few published formulae which are apparently in error or underdetermined , we have the following congruences ( all modulo @xmath0 ) which are undoubtably correct :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where the @xmath23 are jacobi symbols , and    * @xmath18 is as before the fibonacci quotient ( oeis a092330 ) * @xmath24 is the pell quotient ( oeis a000129 ) * @xmath25 is a quotient derived from the lucas sequence 1 , 4 , 15 , 56 , 209 , ",
    "( oeis a001353 ) * @xmath26 is a quotient derived from the lucas sequence 1 , 10 , 99 , 980 , 9701 , ",
    "( oeis a004189 ) * @xmath27 * @xmath28 * @xmath29 .",
    "the result for @xmath11 = 8 is derived from the 1991 paper by williams ( @xcite , p.  440 ) , with an equivalent result also appearing in sun ( @xcite , pt .  3 , theorem 3.3 ) . to the best of our knowledge , at the time of the discovery of this formula in 1991 the vanishing of @xmath30 modulo @xmath0",
    "was not recognized as a condition for the failure of the first case of flt for the exponent @xmath0 , and this only became evident with the appearance of the 1995 paper of dilcher and skula @xcite discussed below .",
    "the result for @xmath11 = 10 is due to a 1992 paper by z.h .",
    "sun ( @xcite , pt .  3 ,",
    "theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "since the vanishing of all the individual components was by then known to be a necessary condition for the failure of the first case of flt for the exponent @xmath0 , the same thing was immediately seen to be true for @xmath31 .    the result for @xmath11 = 12",
    "is also derived from the 1991 paper of williams ( @xcite , p.  440 ) , and that for @xmath11 = 24 is from a 2011 paper of kuzumaki & urbanowicz ( @xcite , p.  139 ) .",
    "in their landmark joint paper of 1995 , dilcher and skula @xcite proved among other things that the vanishing modulo @xmath0 of @xmath1 was a necessary criterion for the failure of the first case of flt for the exponent @xmath0 , for all @xmath11 from 2 to 46 .",
    "this result gives retrospective interest to the evaluations of @xmath30 and @xmath32 , and furnishes the main motivation for the present study .      as discussed in section [ computational considerations ] below , when calculating the sort of special harmonic number with which we are concerned , it is important to avoid by any means possible the calculation of the long runs of modular inverses suggested by the definition ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) . in the early days of this study @xmath34",
    "was obtained from @xmath31 , requiring the calculation of inverses for @xmath35 of the numbers in the range @xmath36 .",
    "this is more efficient than obtaining @xmath37 from @xmath38 , the nearest neighbor that can be calculated by formula , which requires the calculation of inverses for @xmath39 of the numbers in the range @xmath36 .",
    "however , assuming @xmath37 will be calculated anyway , @xmath34 can be derived from it without calculation of any additional inverses , and with negligible cost .",
    "the device proposed is somewhat convoluted , but worthwhile . in 1991 , zhi - hong sun ( @xcite , theorem 2.7 ) gave an evaluation of    @xmath40    which is in fact trivially equivalent to    @xmath41    to use a well - known notation for this sum . consider the recurrence defined by    @xmath42    sun showed that there is a composition , which we shall designate @xmath43 , defined by    @xmath44    such that    @xmath45    the evaluation of the sequence @xmath46 can be performed efficiently in pari using the matrix exponentiation @xmath47\\textrm{\\textasciicircum{}}n)[1 , 1]}$ ] , with the calculations being performed modulo @xmath48 throughout .",
    "thus , noting that by definition ,    @xmath49    we have from ( [ eq : sundefinition ] ) that    @xmath50    no direct evaluations of @xmath37 and @xmath34 comparable to that for @xmath51 are known , but sun s result allows efficient evaluation modulo @xmath0 of either of these special harmonic numbers with respect to the other . compared with a scheme in which the two quantities are calculated separately ,",
    "the derivation of @xmath34 from @xmath37 requires the calculation of @xmath52 as many modular inverses , while the derivation of @xmath37 from @xmath34 requires the calculation of only @xmath53 as many inverses .",
    "however , we choose the former path because we also require the values of @xmath1 with @xmath54 .",
    "it may be helpful to distinguish the purpose of the present study with that of the more general problem of the divisibility of harmonic numbers .",
    "eswarathasan and levine @xcite note that all primes greater than 3 divide the harmonic numbers of indices @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , and wolstenholme s theorem states that for a prime @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "these results may be inverted to give three general rules for the divisibility of harmonic numbers :    1 .",
    "@xmath60 is divisible by @xmath61 if @xmath62 is a prime @xmath63 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath60 is divisible by @xmath64 if the latter is a prime @xmath63 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath60 is divisible by @xmath65 if the latter is a prime @xmath63 .",
    "eswarathasan and levine define _ harmonic _ primes as primes that divide only the three aforementioned harmonic numbers ( oeis a092101 ) , and _ anharmonic _ primes as those that divide additional harmonic numbers ( oeis a092102 ) . from the fact that we consider only cases ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) where @xmath66 with @xmath2 ,",
    "it will be evident that any such @xmath0 is anharmonic , and that we are seeking a subset of anharmonic primes that divide harmonic numbers of relatively small index ; for example , from table [ table_5 ] we see that @xmath67 is solved by @xmath68 , implying that @xmath69 , while @xmath70 is solved by @xmath71 , implying that @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , the work of boyd @xcite and rogers @xcite entails , in part , finding harmonic numbers of large index divisible by relatively small primes , such as the case @xmath73 . the overlap between our results and theirs",
    "is slight .    indeed ,",
    "our results entail only a minority of the anharmonic primes , because they require that @xmath0 divide an harmonic number @xmath60 with @xmath74 , and thus belong to a subset of the anharmonic primes which has sometimes been called the harmonic irregular primes ( see oeis a092194 and the wikipedia entry for `` regular prime '' ) .",
    "although the standard definition of such a prime @xmath0 is that it divide an harmonic number @xmath60 with @xmath74 , it may be noted that any prime satisfying this criterion must in fact divide some harmonic number @xmath60 of smaller index @xmath75 , since by symmetry @xmath76 .",
    "the inequality sign in this condition is strict because if @xmath77 , then @xmath0 is a wieferich prime and by ( [ eq : p2 ] ) and ( 4 ) must likewise divide the smaller @xmath78 . but",
    "this inequality also gives a sharp upper bound on the index of the least harmonic number divisible by an harmonic irregular prime @xmath0 , since among the first 999 primes we have @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( see oeis a125854 ) .",
    "in general , there does not seem to be any way of recognizing an harmonic irregular prime other than by exhaustively testing it as a divisor of harmonic numbers @xmath60 with @xmath81 ( though one would of course not attempt to do this by actual division except for very small @xmath0 ) .",
    "in turn , our results entail only a minority of the harmonic irregular primes , because we must have @xmath82 for some @xmath11 . nonetheless , for some small primes this relationship is satisfied by more than one value of @xmath11 ; for example , with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .    taking into account the stringency of the conditions on @xmath0 , it is perhaps unsurprising that few instances have been found where a given @xmath0 divides distinct harmonic numbers of the special type under consideration . by ( [ eq : p2 ] ) and ( 4 ) all wieferich primes",
    "@xmath0 divide both @xmath78 and @xmath86 , but otherwise we have found only two instances where a non - wieferich prime @xmath87 divides two distinct harmonic numbers of index @xmath88 in such a way that @xmath82 is satisfied for some @xmath89 in each case : for @xmath90 , @xmath0 divides both @xmath91 ( with @xmath11 = 85 through 95 ) and @xmath92 ( with @xmath11 = 32 , 33 ) , and for @xmath93 , @xmath0 divides both @xmath94 ( with @xmath11 = 836 ) and @xmath95 ( with @xmath11 = 555 ) .",
    "perhaps further solutions exist with larger @xmath11 , but we expect such primes to be rare",
    ".    there is , however , a sense in which our results do relate to the general problem of the divisibility of harmonic numbers . while the formulae ( [ eq : p2 ] ) through ( [ eq : p24 ] ) are framed in terms of @xmath0 , they may conversely be seen as divisibility conditions on @xmath60 .",
    "for example , with @xmath96 ( the wieferich primes ) , we seek cases where the numerator of @xmath60 is divisible by a prime @xmath97 , @xmath98 , or @xmath99 .",
    "the still unresolved case @xmath100 asks whether it is possible for @xmath60 to be divisible by a prime of one of the forms @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , or @xmath104 , and the still unresolved case @xmath105 whether it is possible for @xmath60 to be divisible by a prime of one of the forms @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , or @xmath109 .",
    "incidentally , we also tested the numerators of @xmath60 for divisibility by any of these linear forms without the restriction that the divisors be prime , and found only one additional solution for @xmath110 , for a divisor of the form @xmath106 : @xmath111 is divisible by 121 , which is of course @xmath112 .",
    "for the same ranges of @xmath0 as covered by table [ table_5 ] below , the following table shows , for small @xmath113 , all linear forms for which there exists no known @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) dividing an harmonic number @xmath60 .",
