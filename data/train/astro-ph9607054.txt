    "despite years of study and volumes of data , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remain among the most mysterious cosmic phenomena . perhaps the greatest impediment to theoretical progress",
    "is that the source of grbs is unknown .",
    "although it is widely thought that neutron stars are involved , there is no consensus on even the broadest details of the physical processes involved .",
    "the main reason for this is that the distance to grbs is not known .",
    "many have interpreted the observations of grb isotropy and spatial inhomogeneity ( fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) by the _",
    "compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "s burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) as indicating that bursts are at cosmological distances .",
    "attempts have been made to verify this conclusion with batse data ( davis et al .",
    "1994 ; norris et al .  1994 )",
    "but the claims are controversial ( band 1994 ; brainerd 1994 ) and the possibility of a galactic origin has not been ruled out ( c.f . , podsiadlowski , rees , & ruderman 1995 ) . uncertainty in the distance to grbs leads to uncertainty in the energy required to generate observed grbs and hence , confusion about the source physics .",
    "if the distance scale to grbs can be determined , it will be the greatest step yet taken toward understanding these enigmatic events .",
    "an excellent way to establish the grb distance scale is to discover counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "counterparts could also reveal valuable information about burst sources and environments which would have an enormous impact on our physical understanding of these events .",
    "for example , if grbs were found only in a particular environment , then properties unique to that environment are likely to be responsible for the burst .",
    "many groups ( see reviews by schaefer 1994 and greiner 1995 ) have attempted to find counterparts which flare along with the burst , are observable in quiescence , or appear as afterglows . to date , convincing counterparts have been found only for soft gamma repeaters , which many believe to be unrelated to grbs ( although this opinion is not universal ; see rothschild & lingenfelter 1996 ) .",
    "several theories have been been proposed which predict emission at wavelengths other than gamma - rays ( a number of them are listed in schaefer 1994 ) although the guidance they provide is slim considering that many were advanced at a time when bursts were thought to originate at distances @xmath2  kpc , much closer than is now believed .",
    "since we have no clear expectations as to the appearance of a burst source in quiescence or immediately after the gamma - ray event , we assume in this work that all optical emission occurs at the same time as the high energy emission and is the low energy tail of the gamma ray spectrum .",
    "just as we extrapolate observed x - ray and gamma - ray emission to the optical - uv band , some model high energy spectra can be extrapolated to lower energy .",
    "katz ( 1994 ) and tavani ( 1996a , b ) proposed a model where particles in a relativistic shocked plasma with an equilibrium energy distribution radiate a synchrotron spectrum which can extend to optical energies .",
    "mszros & rees ( 1993 ) modeled the multiwavelength emissions of a fireball which interacts with the surrounding medium , resulting in a reverse shock , with emission from a number of regions .",
    "a variety of different high energy and optical - uv spectra are possible , depending on the physical parameters ( e.g. , densities and magnetic field ) ; for some parameters an optical synchrotron spectrum similar to the katz and tavani models is emitted , while for others the optical emission can be greater , or self - absorbed .",
    "several models predict concurrent low energy emission based on the reprocessing of gamma - rays in a neutron star magnetosphere ( hartmann , woosley , & arons 1988 ) , an accretion disk ( epstein 1985 ) or a stellar companion ( london & cominsky 1983 ) .",
    "these models all assume nearby ( @xmath3 pc ) sources and consequently much smaller source energies ( @xmath4  ergs ) than is required for bursts in the galactic halo or at cosmological distances ( @xmath5  ergs ) ; it is unclear what effect such a large energy release will have on the reprocessing region .",
    "while these reprocessing models predict optical re - emission while the burst is still in progress , the re - emitted flux should be proportional to the total gamma ray energy flux and not to an extrapolation of the gamma ray spectrum .",
    "lacking compelling theoretical expectations , we take an empirical approach to determine how bright simultaneous counterpart emission may be by extrapolating spectra observed by batse to optical and ultraviolet energies (  2 ) .",
    "several experiments capable of detecting simultaneous optical emission from a grb are described (  3 ) and the implications of our results for these experiments are discussed (  4 ) .",
    "we base our extrapolated fluxes on spectral fits to 54 bright grbs from the first 13 months of batse operation ( band et al .  1993 ) .",
    "the bursts were selected with a brightness criterion using the peak count rate in the @xmath6  kev energy band .",
    "most bursts which met the intensity requirement were included in the sample , but there were a few exceptions .",
    "bright bursts shorter than 1s were left out of the sample while some dim bursts with interesting time structure were included ; the number in both cases was small . although the sample is not statistically complete , it is representative of bright bursts .    in this work ,",
    "we ignore interstellar absorption .",
    "while this effect will render sources which must be observed through the galactic plane invisible in the optical - uv band , it is far less important above the plane . near the galactic poles , absorption typically dims sources by @xmath7 ( mihalas & binney 1981 , p.  181 ) .",
    "the exact amount of absorption depends on the amount of interstellar matter along the line of sight , something which is not a simple function of elevation angle above the plane because of the clumpy nature of the interstellar medium .",
    "given the large range of magnitudes which results from our extrapolation of the spectrum over four energy decades under very simple assumptions , the additional complexity of modeling interstellar absorption of @xmath8 off the galactic plane is not warranted .",
    "band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) fitted spectra averaged over the entire burst to a four parameter function of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 were fitted to the observed spectra and @xmath12 was chosen to make the function continuously differentiable everywhere .",
    "the energy range covered by the fit varied , with typical lower and upper energy cutoffs of @xmath13  kev and @xmath14  mev , respectively .",
    "this is a differential photon number spectrum which must be multiplied by energy , @xmath15 , to get the energy flux .",
    "note that the spectral indices in eq .",
    "( 1 ) do not have an explicit minus sign .    here",
    "we extrapolate the fitted spectra down to 1  kev where they break to a power law with a different spectral index which describes the optical through soft x - ray spectra .",
    "the index of the low energy extrapolation is varied from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in integer steps .",
    "in addition , we include an energy index of 1/3 , which is physically interesting , as we discuss below .",
    "finally , a low energy power law spectrum of index @xmath18 , an unmodified continuation of the gamma ray spectrum , is extrapolated to the optical range .",
    "discussions of counterpart emission are conventionally based on burst fluence ; expected magnitudes are presented as if all the emission occurred in one second ( schaefer 1981 ) .",
    "although this is not consistent with the assumption of strictly simultaneous optical emission , it is a useful exposure - time independent standardization .",
    "we calculate fluence based magnitudes in the energy bands of the u , b , and v filters and the @xmath19  ev bandpass of the uv camera array on the _ high energy transient explorer _ ( _ hete _ , discussed in  3 ) . for the first three bands , we convolved spectra with the filter response functions ( budding 1993 , p.  46 ) and converted the fluxes to magnitudes .",
    "the _ hete _",
    "bandpass is not a standard wavelength band so we integrate the flux over the @xmath19  ev band . expected magnitudes for a one second exposure are given in table  1 and distributions for the @xmath18 and 1/3 extrapolations are shown in figures 1 and  2 ( the distributions for the integral indices are identical to the distribution for 1/3 , but with the magnitude axis shifted ) .",
    "the true differential distribution is a convolution of the intensity distribution and the distribution of spectral shapes .",
    "since the burst intensity distribution increases with decreasing intensity ( perhaps until the spatial inhomogeneity becomes particularly severe ) , we expect the optical magnitude distribution to increase with magnitude .",
    "however , our calculated optical distributions are based on a sample of bright bursts , and therefore the distributions are truncated on the large magnitude ( low optical flux ) side .",
    "if the optical searches can reach magnitudes larger than or comparable to the peaks of the distributions in figures 1 and  2 , then the number of bursts which these searches may detect will be underestimated . however , as will be demonstrated below , this is not an issue for physically interesting extrapolations .",
    "although fluence - based measures of brightness are the standard , flux - based measures are more meaningful when detector exposure durations are comparable to the burst duration ( note that we assume the optical emission has the same duration as the gamma - ray emission ) .",
    "this distinction is unimportant when the exposure time is longer than the burst since the entire burst fluence will be observed .",
    "indeed , the search for optical transients began with the inspection of photographic plates which had exposure times much longer than the typical burst duration . if , however , the exposure time is shorter than the burst , then only a fraction of the total flux is observed and fluence - based measures will overestimate the brightness of a burst .",
    "another concern when dealing with real experiments is spectral response .",
    "all the instruments we consider except _ hete _ are ground based and sensitive between @xmath20 .",
    "although this energy band is very wide , the convention is to define sensitivities in terms of v magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we convolve spectra with the response function of the v - filter and convert the flux to magnitude for comparison",
    ". this will introduce slight errors in the comparison of observability because the grb spectra are assumed to be power laws while the sensitivities of the instruments were determined using stars , which have black body continua .",
    "these errors are not large however and a proper treatment would require detailed knowledge of the complicated response functions of the various experiments .    for each instrument we calculated the",
    "expected observed flux within each experiment s exposure time . in all cases ,",
    "the detector response was assumed to be linear ( no saturation ) .",
    "if a burst was shorter than the exposure time , the entire flux of the burst was averaged over the exposure time ( equivalent to the fluence - based magnitude with dilution for exposure times @xmath21s ) .",
    "if the burst was longer , we used the average flux over the exposure time .",
    "this process can be expressed mathematically as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the v band extrapolated flux and @xmath24 is the v band flux of a magnitude zero object ( 3.08@xmath25 ergs/@xmath26-s  budding 1993 , p.  46 ) .",
    "@xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the instrument exposure time and @xmath30 is the burst duration .",
    "the case @xmath31 is only an approximation to the true instantaneous flux because intensity and spectra vary within a burst ( ford et al .",
    "although the spectral changes are not as radical as intensity fluctuations , spectral variations are amplified by the four decade extrapolation from the lowest energy gamma - rays included in the original spectral fits .",
    "better sensitivity can be obtained for the short exposure instruments by adding subsequent images together .",
    "we did not consider this effect since approximately one magnitude is gained for a typical burst .",
    "this boost in sensitivity is likely to be more than compensated by our neglect of slew times for telescopes which respond to a burst trigger since typically the brightest emission occurs early in the burst .",
    "instruments which can detect simultaneous optical emission from grbs can be grouped into two categories .",
    "the first has large fields - of - view and long exposure times ( @xmath32  min ) .",
    "these telescopes were designed for meteor patrols , wide field imaging or variable star patrols , but their large fields - of - view make them well suited for grb detection . many of these instruments are outlined in greiner et al .",
    "those most likely to image a field containing a grb are sky patrols from sonneberg and ondejov ( the odessa and dushanbe sky patrols have been suspended because of economic difficulties in ukraine and tadshikistan  j .",
    "greiner 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "although the patrol plates have a variety of sensitivities and exposure times , we concentrate on sky patrol plates from ondejov because its field - of - view is particularly wide and it has three coincidences with bursts in the band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) sample ( greiner et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the second class of instruments we consider is characterized by short exposure times .",
    "these instruments are much more sensitive to grbs , which seldom last more than a few minutes ( the longest burst in our sample is 130s ) .",
    "we consider four experiments here : the explosive transient camera ( etc , vanderspek et al.1994 ) , the gamma - ray optical counterpart search experiment ( grocse , akerlof et al .",
    "1994 ) , the gamma - ray to optical transient experiment ( gtote , s. barthelmy 1995 , private communication ) , and the ultraviolet transient camera array on the _ hete _ spacecraft ( ricker et al .  1992",
    "; vanderspek et al .",
    "all of these instruments monitor a portion of the sky but the etc , grocse , and gtote can slew to preliminary batse positions distributed on the bacodine network ( barthelmy et al .",
    "bacodine requires up to five seconds to localize a grb and another few seconds to distribute the coordinates on the network .",
    "after that , the telescope must slew to the proper position .",
    "these delays will often result in bright portions of the burst being missed by the telescope .",
    "we ignore these concerns in this paper so our extrapolated brightness may be somewhat optimistic .",
    "details of all the instruments mentioned here are presented in table  2 .",
    "the flux - based magnitudes of bursts expected under our assumptions are given in table  3 .",
    "figures 3a and  b show the v - band brightness distribution of our sample for extrapolations with energy indices of @xmath33 ( the low energy gamma - ray power law ) and @xmath34 , respectively , for the etc .",
    "although the etc , grocse , and gtote have varying integration times , only six of the 54 bursts in our sample were shorter than five seconds ( the exposure time of the etc ) .",
    "these bursts are slightly brighter in grocse and gtote .",
    "the difference is only a few tenths of a magnitude though and the resulting distributions have the same maximum and median brightness .",
    "the overall distributions are almost identical as well so that figure  3 applies to all three of these experiments .",
    "figures 4a and  b show similar distributions for _",
    "an extrapolation with an energy power law index of  2 could correspond to the rayleigh - jeans portion of a thermal spectrum . for the rayleigh - jeans power law to extend to 1  kev",
    "the radiating plasma should have a temperature above @xmath35  kev , which is possible in the extreme conditions expected in the burst environment .",
    "the thermonuclear model of woosley & wallace ( 1982 ) predicted an x - ray tail with a temperature greater than 2  kev ; this model applied to local bursts , and the predicted emission was not concurrent , but the model does show that high temperatures are plausible .",
    "however , table  3 shows that if this is the only component of concurrent grb emission at lower energies , grbs will not be observable at optical or uv wavelengths ( assuming no afterglow ) .",
    "a power law index of 1/3 might result from low energy synchrotron emission ( katz 1994 ; tavani 1996a , b ) .",
    "the low energy limit of the synchrotron spectrum emitted by a single electron is a power law with an index of 1/3 below a characteristic energy of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnetic field , and @xmath38 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the electron s energy . the synchrotron power law indices of @xmath39 familiar from radio astronomy result from a power law electron distribution .",
    "if the electron distribution has a low energy cutoff @xmath40 , then the low energy single electron synchrotron power law of index 1/3 will be observed below @xmath41 .",
    "note that the energy spectral index ( 1+@xmath42 ) of the low energy component of the spectral function in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is typically of order 1/3 . in figures 2 , 3b , and",
    "4b we present the optical - uv burst distributions for an energy index of 1/3 . for this case",
    "the brightest burst in our sample would have appeared as a @xmath43 transient , just at the sensitivity limit of grocse .",
    "therefore , we doubt current instruments can effectively test this model of counterpart emission .",
    "the results of previous optical searches rule out some of the spectral indices considered in this simple model .",
    "in particular , greiner et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) examined sky patrol plates from several sites which were coincident with grbs .",
    "three plates from the ondejov patrol were coincident with bursts in our sample .",
    "these plates had four hour exposures with sensitivity to events brighter than @xmath443 .",
    "the three bursts which overlap with our sample ( 3b911127 , 3b920525 , and 3b920530 ) would have produced optical images at least this bright if the spectrum was a power law of index less than @xmath45 below 1  kev .",
    "( published before the 3b catalog was released , this result is still valid since the difference in the positions of these bursts in the 2b and 3b catalogs is less than the plate dimensions  j .",
    "greiner 1996 , private communication ) this rules out more steeply falling power laws , which is not a severe constraint .",
    "lacking compelling physical guidance for our expectations , the simplest hypothesis is that spectra in the optical band have the same index as at higher energies ( the @xmath33 case ) .",
    "if this is true , then the etc , grocse , and gtote have a chance of detecting the very brightest bursts which trigger batse and are distributed by the bacodine network .",
    "the etc would have seen only the brightest burst in the sample while grocse and gtote would have seen four .",
    "_ hete _ would not fare as well , being unable to detect any grbs in the uv if the @xmath33 extrapolations hold .",
    "being able to detect a grb does not imply it will be observed .",
    "assuming that each site can image half the sky half the time ( night only ) , then there is a 25% chance a batse grb can be slewed to .",
    "for simplicity we neglect other factors which reduce the duty cycle , such as inclement weather and moonlight .",
    "therefore , grocse and gtote might be able to detect one burst per year for the @xmath33 extrapolation and the etc might record a positive detection every four years .",
    "all of these detectors have a monitor mode which could catch a burst batse does not see .",
    "batse has @xmath4633% sky coverage , so the number of potentially detectable grbs is tripled assuming a site can view all the sky all the time .",
    "however , 75% of these are lost to a given ground based site when earth blockage and daytime are included .",
    "most of the rest are inaccessible because the fields - of - view of these instruments is small .",
    "the etc has the largest field - of - view and it covers only 10% of the sky accessible to it .",
    "therefore , detection in the monitor mode of any of these instruments is unlikely for this extrapolation .",
    "the instruments discussed here would have difficulty observing simultaneous optical emission from a grb if optical photons are generated as part of the same spectrum as the gamma - rays .",
    "this implies that if concurrent emission is observed more than about once a year , the energy flux must follow a power law of index greater than @xmath33 , indicative of another spectral component since grb spectra are concave down above 10  kev . however , there are indications of emission in excess of simple extrapolations below @xmath47  kev in 10% of grbs ( preece et al .",
    "1996 ) . therefore , aside from the discovery of a grb counterpart ,",
    "the observation of simultaneous optical emission would indicate a multifaceted emission process , providing new and important information about the burst environment .",
    "using spectra of 54 bright grbs from batse , we have determined the expected optical brightnesses for simultaneous optical emission for an empirical extrapolation of the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we find that in order for concurrent optical emission to be observable , the spectral index of a power law extrapolation must be negative at long wavelengths ( more flux at lower energies ) .",
    "a simple extrapolation to optical wavelengths is only marginally detectable , providing about one observable burst per year for the grocse and gtote telescopes .",
    "this implies that if optical transients concurrent with burst emission are observed more frequently , an additional spectral component must exist .",
    "we are indebted to s. barthelmy and r. vanderspek for sharing details of their instruments .",
    "we also thank r. narayan for suggesting this project and w.  coburn , g.  huszar , d.  marsden , and l.  peterson for their assistance .",
    "we appreciate the insightful comments of the referee , j.  greiner .",
