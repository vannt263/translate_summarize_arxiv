    "the energies of cosmic rays observed near earth extend over a very wide range , from below 10@xmath3 ev to more than 10@xmath4 ev per particle . up to about 10@xmath5 ev per amu , the particle energies and intensities are significantly affected by solar modulation , but for the nearly ten remaining decades , the arriving particles are believed to represent the ambient cosmic - ray population in the local galaxy . over this range ,",
    "the total cosmic - ray intensity ( the `` all particle '' differential energy spectrum , see , for instance , the compilation of @xcite ) decreases monotonically by more than 30 orders of magnitude , initially as a power law @xmath6 e@xmath7 , steepening slightly to e@xmath8 at the `` knee '' above 10@xmath9 ev per particle , and exhibiting small changes in slope again ( a `` second knee '' and an `` ankle '' ) in the 10@xmath10 ",
    "10@xmath11 ev region .",
    "besides these relatively minor changes , the overall spectrum is remarkably featureless , even though a variety of processes may contribute to the cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the general consensus is that the particles below the knee are generated inside our galaxy and are contained by the galactic magnetic fields for millions of years , while at the highest energies ( @xmath12 10@xmath10 ev ) the gyration radii become so large that galactic containment is no longer effective , and that the cosmic rays may then be of extragalactic origin .",
    "the all - particle energy spectrum refers to the overall spectrum of cosmic rays without differentiating the individual components . to obtain deeper insight , details of the composition of the cosmic - ray particles",
    "must be studied .",
    "for instance , very accurate measurements of not only the elemental , but also the isotopic composition are now available at low energies ( @xmath13 10@xmath14  10@xmath5 ev per particle ) .",
    "these have determined such important quantities as the average containment time of cosmic rays in the galaxy from observations of radioactive clock - nuclei ( @xmath15 y at these energies ( first reported by @xcite ; more recent work by @xcite ) , and they have excluded fresh supernova ejecta as source material of cosmic rays from the abundances of co- and ni - isotopes @xcite . at relativistic energies only the abundances of the elemental species , without isotopic detail , have been accessible to measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) , but even these encounter increasingly severe systematic and statistical uncertainties as the energy increases . very few direct observations ( e.g. @xcite ) have provided composition detail with single - element resolution above  10@xmath16 ev per particle .",
    "the work described in this paper represents an attempt to improve this situation , and to determine the energy spectra of individual elemental species up to much higher energies .",
    "the current paradigm of the origin of galactic cosmic rays postulates first - order fermi acceleration in interstellar shock fronts from supernova ( sn ) explosions as the most potent contributor to the cosmic - ray flux below the knee .",
    "this mechanism , first proposed by @xcite , must be very efficient indeed , since as much as @xmath110% of the total kinetic energy released in supernova explosions is required to sustain the cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the sn shock acceleration mechanism predicts a source energy spectrum in the form of a power law @xmath6 @xmath17 , with a spectral index @xmath18 for strong shocks .",
    "such a spectrum is much harder than the @xmath19 spectrum that seems to be typical for most primary cosmic - ray nuclei below the knee .",
    "this difference in spectral slope can be explained if the propagation and containment of cosmic rays in the galaxy are energy - dependent .",
    "such a behavior had indeed been inferred , even before the sn shock acceleration model was formulated , on the basis of measurements of the `` l / m ratio '' , i.e. , of the abundance of secondary , spallation - produced cosmic rays ( such as the light elements li , be , b ) relative to their primary parents ( such as c and o ) , @xcite .",
    "one concludes from such measurements that the average amount of interstellar matter encountered by cosmic - ray nuclei during their propagation through the galaxy decreases with energy .",
    "the effect is often parameterized by a propagation pathlength @xmath20 , which depends on energy as @xmath21 for relativistic nuclei @xcite . the primary cosmic - ray spectrum at the source",
    "would then be approximately @xmath22 or @xmath23 , close to what the shock acceleration model predicts .",
    "this fact provides strong but indirect evidence for the validity of the shock acceleration model .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that current measurements of the l / m ratio do not extend beyond 10@xmath24 ev per amu ( or about 10@xmath25 ev per particle ) .",
    "hence , there is an extended region of energies ( 10@xmath25  10@xmath9 ev per particle ) where the sn shock acceleration model is assumed to be valid , albeit without the benefit of much observational support .",
    "the sn shock acceleration process is expected to become inefficient at energies around @xmath26 10@xmath0 ev ( where @xmath27 is the atomic number of a cosmic - ray nucleus ) @xcite , but this limit is not observationally confirmed .",
    "one might refer to the steepening of the all - particle spectrum at the `` knee '' as evidence , but even then the origin of cosmic rays with energies far beyond the knee remains a mystery .",
    "the sn - shock acceleration model has recently found strong observational support through the detection of tev gamma rays from shell - type sn - remnants @xcite , although there remains a debate whether the parent particles of these gamma rays are electrons or , indeed , protons and nuclei @xcite .    clearly , the present observational evidence about high - energy cosmic rays is inadequate to provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions about their origin and galactic propagation , and there exists an undeniable need for improved measurements at higher energies .",
    "the tracer program has been developed to provide direct measurements of the energy spectra of the heavier cosmic - ray nuclei through balloon flights above the atmosphere , up to energies between 10@xmath0 and 10@xmath9 ev per particle [ the acronym tracer stands for `` transition radiation array for cosmic energetic radiation '' ] .",
    "higher energies are currently studied through indirect observations with ground - based air - shower installations .",
    "however , attempts to obtain composition details from air - shower observations are affected by a number of systematic uncertainties .",
    "one of the goals of tracer is to approach the energy region of air shower measurements , with the hope of providing some cross - calibration with the indirect measurements .",
    "a successful cosmic - ray measurement above the atmosphere must determine at least two quantities for each particle : the charge @xmath27 and the energy @xmath28 .",
    "measurement of @xmath27 is commonly accomplished by utilizing the fact that all electro - magnetic interactions scale with @xmath29 .",
    "hence , devices that measure the ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) such as plastic scintillators or gas proportional counters , or that measure the intensity of cherenkov light , are well suited and are used in tracer .",
    "the energy determination is a greater challenge , mainly because of the large detector areas that are needed at high energy .",
    "extrapolations from lower energies indicate that a successful measurement of nuclei heavier than helium requires detectors with exposure factors of at least several 100 m@xmath30 sr days in order to approach the 10@xmath9 ev per particle region .",
    "such exposures can be accomplished with long - duration ( i.e. , several weeks ) balloon flights if the detectors have sensitive areas of a few square meters . a classic calorimeter that measures the total energy absorbed in matter after a particle interacts",
    "would become much too massive if it were to have an area of this magnitude .",
    "hence , tracer uses electromagnetic interactions not just to determine @xmath27 , but also to measure the energy ( or more exactly , the lorentz - factor @xmath31 ) : measurement of cherenkov light produced in an acrylic cherenkov counter at low energies ( up to a few 10@xmath14 ev per amu ) , measurement of the specific ionization in gases at intermediate energies ( 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath25 ev per amu ) , and measurement of transition radiation at the highest energies ( @xmath32 5 @xmath33 10@xmath24 ev per amu ) .",
    "figure [ resp ] shows the typical energy responses for the detectors used in tracer .",
    "the light intensity of an acrylic cherenkov counter ( refractive index = 1.49 ) increases quickly with energy above a threshold of 0.325 gev per amu ( @xmath34 1.35 ) until it approaches saturation above 20 gev per amu ( @xmath34 22 ) .",
    "the ionization loss in gas decreases with energy , reaches a minimum at @xmath35 = 3.96 , and then increases logarithmically with @xmath28 .",
    "transition radiation ( tr ) x - rays are generated in a multi - surface radiator ( mats of plastic fibers in tracer ) and are detected in a gas proportional counter .",
    "hence , the tr detector measures an ionization loss signal , and at sufficiently high energies ( @xmath32 5 @xmath33 10@xmath24 ev per amu ) , a superimposed signal due to the absorption of tr photons .",
    "the tr signal rises rapidly with the lorentz factor @xmath35 and reaches saturation in the @xmath35 = 10@xmath36  10@xmath37 region .",
    "the use of tr to measure the highest cosmic - ray energies was first implemented for the crn detector in 1985 @xcite , but remains unconventional .",
    "it permits the construction of detectors of very large area .",
    "as the tr intensity increases with @xmath29 , this technique is well suited for measurements of the heavier cosmic rays ( @xmath38 3 ) , but not applicable to protons or he - nuclei where the signals are affected by large statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that the response curves shown in figure [ resp ] for the detectors of specific ionization and tr are double - valued : large signals can either be produced by high - energy particles , or by particles below minimum ionization . the tracer instrument must be launched at latitudes with low geomagnetic cutoff energies where a significant cosmic - ray intensity arrives with sub - relativistic energies . the inclusion of a plastic cherenkov counter which identifies the low - energy particles is then essential in order to remove the degeneracy of ionization and tr response .",
    "overall , the counter combination chosen for tracer measures the energies of cosmic - ray nuclei over a very wide range , in excess of four orders of magnitude .",
    "a schematic cross - section of the tracer instrument is shown in figure [ tracer ] .",
    "the detector elements are rather large in area ( 206 cm @xmath33 206 cm ) , and are vertically separated by 120 cm .",
    "this leads to an overall geometric factor of about 5 m@xmath30sr .",
    "the instrument has been previously described @xcite , and a detailed technical description of the detector elements is currently being prepared for a separate publication . here",
    ", we will present a brief summary of the relevant properties of the instrument .",
    "as figure [ tracer ] shows , the individual components of tracer are , from top to bottom :    \\1 . a plastic scintillator sheet ( bicron-408 material ) , with active area 200 cm @xmath33 200 cm , and 0.5 cm thick .",
    "the scintillator is viewed by 24 photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) via wavelength shifter bars .",
    "four double layers of single - wire proportional tubes , oriented in two orthogonal directions .",
    "each tube is 200 cm long and 2 cm in diameter .",
    "the tube walls are wound from aluminized mylar and are about 127 @xmath39 m thick .",
    "another four double layers of proportional tubes of identical design , but each double layer located below blankets of plastic fiber material , which form a radiator to generate transition radiation .",
    "all tubes are filled with a mixture of xenon and methane ( at equal parts by volume ) and are operated in flight at a pressure of 0.5 atmospheres .",
    ". a second scintillator of identical design , but read out by just 12 pmts , and located below the lowest layer of proportional tubes .",
    "\\5 . a cherenkov counter , with active area 200 cm @xmath33 200 cm and 1.27 cm thick , at the bottom of the detector stack .",
    "the cherenkov material consists of an acrylic plastic ( refractive index = 1.49 ) , doped with wavelength shifter material .",
    "signals are read out via wavelength - shifter bars connected to 24 pmts ( as for the scintillator on top ) .",
    "the two scintillators serve as triggers for the instrument and , together with the cherenkov counter , determine the elemental charge @xmath27 of individual cosmic - ray nuclei traversing the instrument .",
    "the proportional counter arrays measure the energy ( or lorentz - factor @xmath40 ) of the cosmic - ray particles at high energies , and they determine the trajectory of each particle traversing the instrument in two projections .",
    "the signals in the top four double layers simply are a measure for the ionization energy loss ( @xmath41 ) of the particle .",
    "the small logarithmic increase above the minimum - ionization level provides an estimate of the particle energy up to lorentz factors of a few hundred .",
    "the lower four double layers of tubes form a transition radiation detector ( trd ) .",
    "as the response curves in figure [ resp ] show , the trd signals are identical to the de / dx signals of the tubes above , except at the highest energies ( @xmath35 @xmath32 400 ) , where the rapid increase of the signal with increasing @xmath35 permits an energy measurement .",
    "the signals of the proportional tubes ( a total of about 1600 ) are processed through vlsi chips ( `` amplex '' , @xcite ) .",
    "the finite dynamic range of these devices restricts the range of elemental species for which data could be recorded in this flight , from oxygen ( @xmath27 = 8) to iron ( @xmath27 = 26 ) .",
    "the tracer instrument derives its heritage from the crn detector that was developed by our laboratory in the 1980s for space flight @xcite .",
    "in fact , the radiator material used for the tracer - trd is identical to that of crn .",
    "however , crn employed thin - window multiwire proportional chambers to detect transition radiation , and hence , needed a heavy pressurized container .",
    "the proportional tubes used in tracer instead can easily withstand external low pressure ; and thus , a pressurized gondola is not required and not used for tracer .",
    "tracer had first a one - day balloon flight in fort sumner , new mexico , in 1999 .",
    "the results from this flight have been published @xcite . a circumpolar long - duration balloon ( ldb )",
    "flight was originally planned for a flight in the northern hemisphere with a launch from alaska , but could not be conducted because of the lack of relevant international agreements .",
    "therefore , an ldb flight had to be planned in antarctica , but had to wait until 2003 , when a new launch vehicle commensurate with the weight of tracer ( 6,000 lbs . , including ballast , telemetry , and balloon - related instrumentation ) became operational .",
    "tracer was launched near mcmurdo , antarctica , on december 12 , 2003 . during its two - week flight ( see figure  [ map ] ) at an average height of 37.75 km ( 3.9 g/@xmath42 ) with excursions not exceeding @xmath2 1.75 km , it collected data from a total of 5 @xmath33 10@xmath43 cosmic - ray events .",
    "the data were transmitted at 500 mbit / sec to the ground ( when the instrument was within telemetry range ) and stored on six disks on - board and recovered after termination of the flight .",
    "overall , the instrument performed very well during this flight . in particular ,",
    "the entirely passive thermal insulation kept the temperatures of all detector components close to room temperature , with diurnal variations of at most a few degrees c. there was no indication of a deterioration of the performance of the proportional tubes due to gas poisoning for the duration of the flight .",
    "this result would be of great practical importance if flights of such devices for much longer duration ( for instance in space ) are anticipated : there seems to be no need for gas - purging at the time scales of at least a few weeks , except for the provision of make - up gas to correct for minor gas leaks .",
    "the data acquisition system operated very efficiently , with a dead time of just 6% , but the total time during which data could be recorded was limited to ten days , due to a catastrophic failure of the rechargeable lithium batteries ( which were used to buffer the solar - power system ) towards the end of the first orbit of the balloon around the south pole .",
    "the first step in the analysis of the data is the accurate reconstruction of the trajectory of each cosmic - ray particle through the instrument .",
    "the entire array of proportional tubes is used for this purpose .",
    "it consists of four double layers of tubes in each the x- and y- direction .",
    "hence , ideally a trajectory is characterized by eight tube `` hits '' in each projection . in practice ,",
    "sometimes the particle may pass between adjacent tubes of a given layer and not generate a hit in this layer .",
    "in addition , spurious signals in tubes outside the particle trajectory may be recorded .    as a first estimate",
    ", the path is obtained using the center of each of the tubes hit in an event .",
    "all possible combinations of these tubes are fit with straight lines in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 projection , and the combination in each projection with minimum @xmath46 per degree of freedom and maximum number of tubes used is kept .",
    "this method allows an accuracy of 5 mm in track position .",
    "the procedure is quite efficient : less than 5  % of cosmic - ray nuclei are missed in the process .    a preliminary estimate of the charge of each particle",
    "is then performed using the technique described in the following section .",
    "a subset of the data from which we expect the same average signal in any tube ( high energy @xmath47 or @xmath48 nuclei ) is then used to correct for deviations of the tube positions from their `` ideal '' positions , and to match signal gains within 5  % or less .",
    "corrections due to variations in the tube gain with time either due to temperature changes or small gas leakages are also calculated and applied .",
    "in general , gain variations in a given tube are negligible _ along _ that tube .",
    "finally , the tube signals are corrected to account for minor non - linearities in the front end electronics at large signals .",
    "all these corrections are necessary to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the tube signals below the level of unavoidable physical fluctuations ( `` landau fluctuations '' ) in the energy deposited in the gas .    as a final step ,",
    "the trajectory is refined by using the fact that the energy deposit in each tube is proportional to the track length in that tube .",
    "taking this fact into account , an accuracy of 2 mm in the lateral track position is achieved , which corresponds to a 3  % uncertainty in the total pathlength through all the tubes .",
    "the accuracy and efficiency of this method are verified with a geant4 simulation @xcite of the instrument .",
    "the accurate knowledge of the particle trajectories is essential to the analysis for two reasons : first , it permits corrections of the scintillator and cherenkov signals due to spatial non - uniformities and zenith - angle variations ( see section [ sec : charge ] ) .",
    "second , it makes possible to determine accurately the average energy deposit of a cosmic - ray particle when it traverses the tubes .",
    "specifically , the average signals are as follows :    in the top four double layers , the average specific ionization is defined as    @xmath49    and in the bottom four double layers ( which form the trd ) , the average signal is    @xmath50    here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 refer to energy deposit and pathlength , respectively , in tube number @xmath53 .",
    "the two quantities defined in ( [ dedxeq ] ) and ( [ dedxtreq ] ) are , of course , identical within fluctuations at energies where no transition radiation is detectable ( @xmath54 ) . in order to exclude large fluctuations associated with short pathlengths ,",
    "we remove tubes with @xmath55 1 cm from the summation .      as a first step to determine the charge of each particle ,",
    "the signal recorded by each pmt is corrected to account for the spatial non - uniformities in the counter responses .",
    "these corrections are derived using the tracking information together with response maps recorded with muons at ground and verified with the flight data themselves in an iterative procedure .",
    "subsequently , for each event the average signal of all pmts in each counter is calculated , and then normalized to vertical incidence .",
    "figure [ cerscint ] shows a scatter plot of the @xmath56 scintillator signal vs the cherenkov signal .",
    "it is apparent that particles with the same charge are clustered along lines .",
    "the position along the line depends on the primary energy : a concentration of events around maximum cherenkov and minimum scintillation signals corresponds to energies of minimum ionizing particles and above , and the energies decrease for events towards the left of this concentration .",
    "the scintillator signals depend on particle charge as @xmath57 , due to non - linear effects in the light yield , while the cherenkov signals follow the expected @xmath58 dependence .",
    "the residual scintillation in the cherenkov counter is visible in figure [ cerscint ] , and is subtracted out in the analysis .",
    "figure [ zhisto ] shows a charge histogram for all charges obtained from summing along lines of constant charge in figure [ cerscint ] .",
    "the charge resolution evolves from 0.25 charge units for @xmath27=8 ( @xmath47 nuclei ) to 0.5 charge units for @xmath27=26 ( @xmath59 nuclei ) at low energies ( @xmath60 10 gev per amu ) , and increases slightly to 0.3 and 0.6 charge units , respectively , at the highest energies .",
    "note that figure [ zhisto ] is generated just on the basis of the signals of the top scintillator , and thus depicts a histogram of @xmath61 .",
    "one can , in the same fashion , construct a histogram of @xmath62 , using the signals of the bottom scintillator .",
    "for the further analysis , we require that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are consistent within fluctuations for each accepted event . in practice",
    ", this means that particles with @xmath63 are rejected . in almost all cases",
    "these are particles that have undergone a nuclear spallation while traversing the detector material between top and bottom of the instrument ( for numerical detail , see section 5 and figure [ interactions ] ) .",
    "the procedure to select a sample of a given element for further analysis is as follows : first , with a very tight cut on @xmath62 , clean , penetrating nuclei are selected , and their distribution in @xmath61 is investigated .",
    "this yields the values for charge resolution mentioned above , and it indicates the efficiency if a charge cut on @xmath61 is made .",
    "if the cut on @xmath61 is of the order of @xmath64 charge units , the efficiency is quite high . for certain elements , a tighter cut on @xmath61",
    "must be made , and the efficiency is then reduced .",
    "numerical details are given in section 5 and table [ tab : eff ] .",
    "it should be noted that the tight cut on @xmath62 is only applied in order to determine the form of the charge distribution on @xmath61 . for the final analysis , only a very loose cut on @xmath62",
    "is used to remove interacting particles .",
    "this cut leads to a negligible reduction in overall charge selection efficiency .",
    "finally , it should be noted that `` edge '' effects can compromise the charge resolution . to avoid this problem , tracks with an impact point within 1 cm of the wavelength - shifter bars are excluded .",
    "this creates a dead area in the detector of about 4 % of the total area .",
    "the energy of each cosmic - ray nucleus is obtained from the combined signals of the cherenkov counter and of the proportional tubes .",
    "the top four double layers of tubes measure the specific ionization of each particle , @xmath65 , while the bottom four double layers detect transition radiation , measuring @xmath66 .",
    "while the main objective of the cherenkov counter is to identify low energy particles , below the level of minimum ionization , the rapid increase of the signal with energy provides a good energy measurement up to about 3 gev per amu .    at energies between minimum ionization and the onset of tr ( 3 to 400 gev per amu ) the signals in the de / dx tubes and the tr tubes",
    "are the same and increase logarithmically with energy .",
    "this increase is slow and can be used for an energy measurement unless it is obscured by statistical signal fluctuations .",
    "the relative level of the fluctuations decreases with the nuclear charge as @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the energy measurement improves with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "note that each individual proportional tube provides an estimate for the specific ionization by measuring the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "hence , for any particle up to 16 tubes provide independent measurements , which are required to be consistent within fluctuations . for the final analysis , the average @xmath69 , as defined in equation [ dedxeq ] and [ dedxtreq ] ,",
    "is used .    at the highest energies ( @xmath32 400 gev per amu ) , the signals from the de / dx tubes and from the tr tubes diverge , and the rapid increase of the tr signals with particle energy provides an excellent energy measurement .",
    "however , particles in this energy region are extremely rare , less abundant than particles in the minimum - ionization region by more than four orders of magnitude . to uniquely",
    "identify these particles , it is necessary but not sufficient to just require that low - energy nuclei are rejected on the basis of their cherenkov signals .",
    "in addition , we require that the measurement of their ionization energy loss @xmath65 ( performed with four double layers of de / dx tubes ) places them at an energy level well above minimum ionization ( for details , see section  [ sec : hep ] and table  [ tab : flux1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the combination of de / dx tubes with the trd tubes is crucial for the success of the tracer measurement at the highest energies .      to identify low energy particles , the signals from the cherenkov counter",
    "are compared with those of the de / dx tubes .",
    "the de / dx response , shown in figure [ resp ] , is well described by the bethe - bloch formula .",
    "the cherenkov counter response ( figure [ resp ] ) must be slightly modified to account for effects of delta rays generated by the primary particle in the instrument , while the signals from the proportional tube array remain unaffected by delta rays .",
    "these effects are well understood and have been previously studied and reported @xcite .",
    "the scatter plot in figure [ cerdedx ] shows the correlation of the ionization and cherenkov signals measured for iron nuclei .",
    "the solid line represents the average response expected from simulations .",
    "the cherenkov signal increases with energy until it reaches saturation , while the ionization signal clearly exhibits the level of minimum ionization ( @xmath1 3 gev per amu ) .",
    "note that the gray scale of the scatter plot is logarithmic .",
    "plots like this one for each charge exhibit the level of fluctuations in the cherenkov signal : it is about 8 % for o nuclei and 2.5 % for fe nuclei .",
    "a cut in the cherenkov signal is placed at a level that corresponds to the minimum in the ionization signal .",
    "events with cherenkov signals below this cut are used to generate their energy spectrum from 0.8 to 2.3 gev per amu .",
    "events with cherenkov signals above the cut are used to construct the energy spectra above 12 gev per amu as described in the following section .      after removing all particles below about 3 gev per amu",
    ", the rare high energy particles are identified from the combination of the signals from the de / dx tubes and the trd .",
    "these detectors have been calibrated at accelerators using singly charged particles .",
    "figure [ trcurve ] shows the measured response for the trd of the crn instrument @xcite .",
    "the radiator combination and gas mixtures of tracer are identical to those of the crn instrument . however , crn used plane multiwire proportional chambers rather than the layers of cylindrical proportional tubes of tracer .",
    "we have ascertained in monte - carlo simulations that the accelerator calibrations for crn remain valid for the detector geometry of tracer .",
    "most of the data shown in figure [ trcurve ] have been published previously @xcite .    below 400 gev / amu",
    "we expect no observable transition radiation . both signals , @xmath65 and @xmath70 ,",
    "increase logarithmically with energy and will cluster along the diagonal in a correlation plot of trd response vs ionization response as illustrated in figure [ trdvsdedx ] . above 400 gev per amu ,",
    "tr becomes observable , and the signal from the trd will increase above the ionization signal .",
    "this manifests itself as a deviation from the diagonal in the correlation plot .    as an example , figure [ trdedx ] shows the observed cross correlation between the trd and the ionization signals for neon nuclei ( @xmath27 = 10 ) above minimum ionization . the small black points represent the numerous events with energies below the onset of tr .",
    "the rare high energy particles with clear tr signals are highlighted .",
    "as expected , the data follow the response illustrated in figure [ trdvsdedx ] .",
    "note that the highest energy events ( the @xmath71 events ) stand out without any background in other regions of the scatter plot .",
    "the most energetic neon nucleus in this sample of data has an energy of @xmath72ev .",
    "we must emphasize again that the off - diagonal position of these higher energy events defines them uniquely as tr - events for the selected charge ( z=10 in figure [ trdedx ] ) .",
    "any spillover due to misidentified charges , with z either larger or smaller than the selected value , would lead to signals along the diagonal , but would not contaminate the well defined `` tr - tails '' .",
    "each event that passes the data analysis cuts is classified in energy as either as a _",
    "cherenkov event _",
    "( @xmath60 3 gev per amu ) , _ de / dx event _ ( 10 - 400 gev per amu ) or _ tr event _ ( @xmath32 400 gev per amu ) .",
    "events are sorted into energy bins of width @xmath73 and a differential energy spectrum is constructed for each elemental species .",

    "the intrinsic relative signal fluctuations decrease with increasing @xmath27 , essentially as @xmath67 ( figure  [ eres ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of acceptable energy bins increases for elements with higher charge number .    as the shape of the energy spectra",
    "is not expected to vary rapidly with energy , choosing too fine a subdivision of the energy scale might just lead to increased statistical uncertainty in each energy bin , and hence , not improve the quality of the results .",
    "more importantly , the widths of the bins must be commensurate with the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "otherwise , overlap corrections for events being misinterpreted from a neighbouring energy bin would become substantial and could possibly bias the result for a steeply falling spectrum .    in the current analysis of the tracer data ,",
    "the bin widths are chosen fairly wide , such that the overlap correction factor can be determined with the help of an iterative monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the corrections are computed for each energy bin and element .",
    "they are fairly small , in general @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath93 ) .",

    "note that the energy in the table is given in units of kinetic energy per amu , whereas in figure [ tracerspec ] the units are given in terms of kinetic energy per particle .",
    "data from the tracer 2003 flight are indicated by the solid squares . for clarity the intensity of each element",
    "is scaled by a factor shown on the left .",
    "existing data from measurements in space with heao-3 @xcite and crn @xcite are shown for comparison . in the energy regions where overlap exists , the agreement of the results appears to be quite good .",
    "we note the large range in intensity ( ten decades ) and particle energy ( four decades ) covered by tracer .",
    "as can be seen , the energy spectra extend up to and beyond 10@xmath0 ev .",
    "the eight elements for which spectra are shown in figure [ tracerspec ] represent the major primary species from oxygen to iron ; contributions to these species from spallation produced secondary elements are expected to be small .",
    "we may fit the high - energy part ( @xmath32 20 gev per amu ) of each spectrum to a power law in energy @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting spectral indices are shown in figure [ powerlaw ] .",
    "remarkably , there is no significant trend of the spectral indices with charge @xmath27 , and all indices fit well to an average of @xmath103 = 2.65 @xmath2 0.05 .",
    "it must be emphasized that this result is not an artifact of the method of defining the differential intensities described in the previous sections .",
    "the similarity of the spectral shapes must indicate that acceleration and propagation mechanisms are essentially the same for all species .",
    "however , the statistical errors do not exclude the possibility of deviations from a pure power - law behavior for individual spectra .",
    "in figure [ tracerspec ] , the energy spectra obtained with tracer are shown together with measurements in space with the heao-3 satellite up to @xmath110 40 gev per amu , and with the crn detector on the space shuttle up to about 1000 gev per amu . however , a multi - decade plot such as that of figure [ tracerspec ] may obscure the finer details in a steeply falling spectrum . to illustrate this",
    ", we show the energy spectra for o , ne , and fe , in figure [ fe - ne - o ] multiplied with @xmath111 .",
    "it is apparent that the differences between individual data sets seem to be mostly statistical .",
    "we note that figure [ fe - ne - o ] also includes a recent determination of the high - energy iron spectrum that was performed with the hess imaging air cherenkov telescope on the ground .",
    "here it was possible for the first time to observe directly the cherenkov light of iron - group nuclei in the atmosphere before they interact @xcite .",
    "again , the agreement with the tracer data is good , although uncertainty about the choice of a nuclear interaction model affects the interpretation of the hess measurement .",
    "there are also several recent or current balloon - borne detectors that are designed to obtain measurements of the high - energy cosmic - ray composition , for instance runjob @xcite , atic @xcite , and cream @xcite ; all of these employ mostly calorimetric techniques .",
    "the runjob experiment has published energy spectra for mostly elemental groups . the iron spectrum from this experiment",
    "is also included in figure [ fe - ne - o ] .",
    "again we see that there is good agreement with the tracer data .",
    "spectra for a few individual heavy elements , more limited in energy coverage and statistics than tracer , have been reported for atic and cream at conferences @xcite .",
    "these results are not included here as they are still labeled preliminary",
    ". however , the agreement in the regions of overlap appears to be quite good .",
    "data for oxygen and iron from tracer are compared in figure [ airshower ] with spectra derived from indirect air - shower observations by the eas - top collaboration @xcite , and by the kascade group for two different nucleus - nucleus interaction models @xcite .",
    "these groups do not report results for individual elements : the fluxes for the `` cno group '' most likely have about twice the intensity than oxygen alone , while the `` iron group '' probably is dominated by iron .",
    "our results do not yet overlap with the energy region of the air shower data , but the gap is becoming smaller , in particular for oxygen .",
    "additional measurements should indeed lead to significant constraints on the air shower interpretations .",
    "the energy spectra of the cosmic - ray nuclei determined in this investigation extend to energies around @xmath112 ev per particle , or significantly higher for the more abundant nuclei .",
    "we believe that this data set represents the most comprehensive information about the spectra of the heavier primary nuclei currently available .    we have studied in some detail how these results provide constraints on our current understanding of the origin of galactic cosmic rays and of models of acceleration and propagation .",
    "we realize that the upper energy limit of the measurement is still below the region of the cosmic - ray `` knee '' , so perhaps it is not surprising that no significant changes in cosmic - ray composition are yet observed .",
    "however , the great similarity between the individual energy spectra is remarkable .",
    "the result of our studies of these features is currently being prepared for a separate publication .",
    "it is clear that an extension of the measurements to still higher energy is desirable .",
    "the dynamic range of the trd used here is not exhausted with the current measurement .",
    "hence , in order to reach higher energy , the tracer detector would either have to be increased in size , which seems impractical as the instrument is already the largest balloon - borne cosmic - ray detector in existence , or would have to be subjected to additional long - duration balloon flights .",
    "ideally , an instrument like tracer should be exposed in space for several years .    an important objective for measurements beyond the current tracer results",
    "would be an extension of the dynamic range of the detector , such that the light secondary elements ( li , be , b ) as well as carbon and nitrogen can be covered together with the heavier nuclei .",
    "if successful to sufficiently high energies ( @xmath113 gev per amu ) , this measurement would lead to a determination of the l / m abundance ratio , i.e. , to a determination of the propagation pathlength at high energy .",
    "this would be an essential step towards a better understanding of the galactic propagation of cosmic rays . to make this measurement possible",
    ", the electronics of tracer has recently been completely refurbished , and another successful long - duration balloon flight was performed in 2006 .",
    "the analysis of these new data is currently in progress and results will be reported in due course .",
