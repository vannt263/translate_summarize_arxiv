    "a _ @xmath2-plane tree _ is a planted plane tree such that each vertex is colored black or white and for each edge at least one of its ends is white .",
    "gu and prodinger @xcite proved , that the number of 2-plane trees on @xmath3 vertices with black ( white ) root is @xmath4 ( fuss - catalan number of order @xmath5 , sequence a001764 in oeis @xcite ) and @xmath6 ( sequence a006013 in oeis ) respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we are going to study the sequence @xmath7 which begins with @xmath8 of total numbers of such trees ( a007226 in oeis ) .",
    "both the sequences on the right hand side of ( [ aintsuma ] ) are positive definite ( see @xcite ) , therefore so is the sequence @xmath9 itself . in this paper",
    "we are going to study the corresponding probability measure @xmath0 , i.e. such that the numbers @xmath1 are moments of @xmath10 .",
    "first we prove that @xmath10 is mellin convolution of two beta distributions , in particular @xmath10 is absolutely continuous .",
    "then we find the density function of @xmath10 . in the last section",
    "we prove , that @xmath10 can be decomposed as additive free convolution @xmath11 of two measures , which are both infinitely divisible with respect to @xmath12 and are related to the marchenko - pastur distribution .",
    "in particular , the measure @xmath10 itself is @xmath12-infinitely divisible .",
    "let us consider the generating function @xmath13 according to ( [ aintsuma ] ) , @xmath14 is a sum of two generating functions .",
    "the former is usually denoted by @xmath15 : @xmath16 and satisfies equation @xmath17 lambert s formula ( see ( 5.60 ) in @xcite ) implies , that the latter is just square of @xmath15 : @xmath18 so we have @xmath19    combining ( [ aintbfunction ] ) and ( [ aintgbfunction ] ) , we obtain the following equation for @xmath14 : @xmath20 which will be applied later on .",
    "now we will give formula for @xmath21 .",
    "for the generating function of the sequence ( [ aintsuma ] ) we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "denoting @xmath24 we have @xmath25 therefore @xmath26 now we apply formula @xmath27 which can be proved by hypergeometric equation ( note that both the functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 are even , so the right hand side is well defined for @xmath30 ) . putting @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which after elementary calculations gives ( [ aintgeneratingfunction ] ) .",
    "in this part we are going to study the ( unique ) measure @xmath0 for which @xmath35 is the moment sequence .",
    "we will show that @xmath10 can be expressed as the mellin convolution of two beta distributions .",
    "then we will provide explicit formula for the density function @xmath36 of @xmath0 .",
    "recall ( see @xcite ) , that for @xmath37 , the _ beta distribution _",
    "@xmath38 is the absolutely continuous probability measure defined by the density function @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "the moments of @xmath38 are @xmath41    for probability measures @xmath42 , @xmath43 on the positive half - line @xmath44 the _ mellin convolution _ is defined by @xmath45 for every borel set @xmath46 ( @xmath47 denotes the indicator function of the set @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is the distribution of the product @xmath49 of two independent nonnegative random variables with @xmath50 . in particular , if @xmath51 then @xmath52 is the _ dilation _ of @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the dirac delta measure at @xmath56 .",
    "if both the measures @xmath57 have all _ moments _ @xmath58 finite then so has @xmath59 and @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .",
    "the method of mellin convolution has been recently applied to a number of related problems , see for example @xcite .",
    "now we can describe the probability measure corresponding to the sequence @xmath1 .",
    "define @xmath10 as the mellin convolution @xmath62 then the numbers @xmath1 are moments of @xmath10 : @xmath63    it is sufficient to check that @xmath64    in view of formula ( [ ameamuzerobeta ] ) , the measure @xmath10 is absolutely continuous and its support is the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "now we are going to find the density function @xmath36 of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath66\\ [ + \\frac{1}{2^{8/3}\\pi x^{1/3}\\sqrt{3}}\\left(3\\sqrt{1 - 4x/27}+1\\right)&\\left(1+\\sqrt{1 - 4x/27}\\right)^{-1/3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 is the density function of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the density @xmath36 of @xmath10 is represented in fig .",
    "putting @xmath71 and applying the gauss - legendre multiplication formula @xmath72 we obtain @xmath73 @xmath74 then @xmath75 can be extended to an analytic function on the complex plane , except the points @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath70 .",
    "now we are going to apply a particular type of the meijer @xmath14-function , see @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the inverse mellin transform of @xmath75 .",
    "then we have @xmath79 where @xmath67 ( consult @xcite for the role of @xmath56 in the integrals ) . on the other hand , for the parameters of the @xmath14-function we have @xmath80 and hence the assumptions of formula 2.24.2.1 in @xcite are satisfied .",
    "therefore we can apply the mellin transform on @xmath81 : @xmath82 whenever @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , @xmath84 .",
    "now we use slater s formula ( see @xcite , formula 8.2.2.3 ) and express @xmath68 in terms of the hypergeometric functions : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 applying the formula @xmath88 ( see @xcite ) for @xmath89 and @xmath90 we conclude the proof .",
    "in this part we are going to describe relations of @xmath10 with free probability .",

    "denote by @xmath91 the class of probability measures on @xmath92 with compact support . for @xmath93 , with moments @xmath94 and with the _ moment generating function _ : @xmath95 we define its _ @xmath96-transform _ @xmath97 by the equation @xmath98 then the _ additive free convolution _ of @xmath99 is defined as the unique @xmath100 which satisfies @xmath101    if the support of @xmath93 is contained in the positive halfline @xmath102 then we define its _ @xmath103-transform _ @xmath104 by @xmath105 on a neighborhood of @xmath106 . if @xmath107 are such measures then their _ multiplicative free convolution _",

    "then @xmath119 @xmath120 in free probability the measures @xmath121 play the role of the poisson distributions .",

    ". then @xmath136 which gives @xmath137 and finally @xmath138 therefore we can find the @xmath103-transform of @xmath10 : @xmath139 and from ( [ cfreemsrtransforms ] ) we get the @xmath96-transform : @xmath140 now we observe that @xmath141 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath142 comparing with ( [ cfreersfreepoisson ] ) we observe that @xmath143 is the @xmath96-transform of @xmath144 , which implies that @xmath145 is @xmath12-infinitely divisible .",
    "consider the taylor expansion of @xmath146 : @xmath147 since the numbers @xmath148 are moments of the _ arcsine distribution _",
    "@xmath149 the coefficients of the last sum constitute a positive definite sequence .",
    "so @xmath150 is @xmath96-transform of a probability measure @xmath151 , which is @xmath12-infinitely divisible ( see theorem  13.16 in @xcite ) . now using ( [ cfreertransform ] )",
