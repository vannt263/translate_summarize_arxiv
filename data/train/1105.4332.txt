    "the era of unconventional computers  implementations of computing schemes in physical , chemical and biological substrates , and interpretation of the behaviour of natural systems in terms of computation  has brought us a plethora of original prototypes of future and emerging computing architectures .",
    "some examples of this new paradigm are polymer- and conductive foam based extended analog computers  @xcite , chemical reaction - diffusion computers  @xcite , aromatic molecular computers  @xcite , slime mould computers  @xcite , micro - fluidic based computers  @xcite , enzymatic logical circuits  @xcite , molecular arithmetical circuits  @xcite to name but a few .",
    "many of these novel computing devices work on the principle that information is represented by localised states of natural systems ( phase or diffusive waves , propagating pseudopodia , electron density , conformation ) which can then be represented by cellular automata or other discrete automata models ( at least in principle )  @xcite .",
    "most models of unconventional computers suffer , up to different degrees , from boundary problems .",
    "the systems are confined to some experimental arena , e.g. test tube or a petri dish , or even be controlled and programmed by externally imposed geometrical constraints ( e.g. channels in excitable chemical computers )",
    ". it would be incredible useful to produce a model which is self - contained , is not dependent on external constraints and which can , subject to resources and energy supplied , function indefinitely .",
    "a particle `` super collider '' may be the best candidate for such a universal model of boundary free computation .    in his seminal paper `` symbol super colliders ''",
    "@xcite tommaso toffoli envisaged far fetching analogies between physical implementations of particle super colliders , lattice gas and one - dimensional cellular automata .",
    "he suggested that the concept of symbol super collider  where myriad of tokens run along intersecting rings and interact with each other to produce new tokens  can be used in designing novel types of nature - inspired computing devices @xcite .",
    "in present paper we develop toffoli s ideas further and provide computational implementations of particle ` accelerator ' or test rigs , implemented in elementary cellular automata .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "a cellular automaton ( ca ) is a quintuple @xmath2 based on a one - dimensional lattice @xmath3 of cells , where each cell @xmath4 , @xmath5 , takes a state from a finite alphabet @xmath6 .",
    "a sequence @xmath7 of @xmath8 cell - states represents a string or a global configuration @xmath9 on @xmath6 .",
    "we write a set of finite configurations as @xmath10 .",
    "cells update their states via an evolution rule @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 represents a cell neighbourhood that consists of a central cell and a number of neighbours connected locally",
    ". there are @xmath13 different neighbourhoods and if @xmath14 then we have @xmath15 different evolution rules .    an evolution diagram for a ca",
    "is represented by a sequence of configurations @xmath16 generated by the global mapping @xmath17 , where a global relation is given by as @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the initial configuration .",
    "cell states of a configuration @xmath20 are updated simultaneously by the evolution rule as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 indicates cell position and @xmath23 is the radius of neighbourhood @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the elementary basic ca class represents a system of order @xmath24 ( in wolfram s nomenclature @xcite ) , the well - known eca . to represent a specific evolution rule we write name of the rule in a decimal notation , e.g. @xmath25 .",
    "conventional cellular automata are memoryless : the new state of a cell depends on the neighbourhood configuration solely at the preceding time step of @xmath26 .",
    "ca with memory are an extension of eca in such a way that every cell @xmath4 is allowed to remember its states during some fixed period of its evolution .",
    "ca with memory have been proposed originally by alonso - sanz  @xcite .",
    "we implement a memory function @xmath27 as follow :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 determines the degree of memory and each cell @xmath30 is a state function of the series of states of the cell @xmath4 with memory up @xmath31 . to execute the evolution we apply the original rule @xmath32 .",
    "thus in ca with memory , while the mapping @xmath26 remains unaltered , historic memory of all past iterations is retained by featuring each cell as a summary of its past states from @xmath27 .",
    "we can say that cells canalize memory to the map @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the memory function @xmath27 as a majority memory @xmath33 , where in case of a tie given by @xmath34 from @xmath27 we take the last value @xmath4 .",
    "so @xmath35 function represents the classic majority function for three values @xcite as follows :    @xmath36    that represents the cells @xmath37 and defines a temporal ring before to get the next global configuration @xmath9 .",
    "of course , this evaluation can be for any number of values . in this way",
    ", a number of functional memories may be used such as : minority , parity , alpha , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "evolution rules representation in eca with memory as given in @xcite is as follows :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a decimal notation of a particular eca rule and @xmath40 is a kind of memory used given with a specific value of @xmath31 .",
    "thus for example , the majority memory ( @xmath41 ) incorporated in eca rule 30 employing five step of a cell s history ( @xmath42 ) is denoted as @xmath43 . the memory is a function of the ca itself , see schematic explanation in fig .",

    "thus , a filter is a sequence of cells that have a high frequency in the evolution space .",
    "such @xmath65-dimensional string repeat periodically , coexisting with any complex structure without altering or disturbing the global dynamics .",
    "in this section we analyze examples of ballistic collisions between particles in eca and eca with memory .",
    "let us start with eca with memory governed by the rule @xmath66",
    "there are only two types of particles in this rule @xmath67@xmath68 .",

    "initially , a cts works as a traditional tag system @xcite , i.e. , as a substitution system reading the first symbol on the tape , deleting and putting new symbols .",
    "cts are new machines proposed by cook  @xcite as a tool to implement computations in @xmath25 .",
    "cts are a variant of tag systems : they have the same action of reading a tape in the front and adding characters at the end , nevertheless there are some new features as follows :    1 .",
    "a cts needs at least two letters in its alphabet ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "only the first character is deleted ( @xmath80 ) and its respective sequence is added .",
    "if the machine reads a character zero then the production rule is always null ( @xmath81 , where @xmath82 represents the empty word ) .",
    "4 .   there are @xmath83 sequences from @xmath84 which are periodically accessed to specify the current production rule when a nonzero character is taken by the system .",
    "therefore the period of each cycle is determinate by @xmath83 .",
    "this way a cycle determines a partial computation over the tape .",
    "no particular halt conditions are specified in the original paper  @xcite , possibly because the halting is a direct consequence of tag systems .",
    "let us see some samples of a cts working with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the production rules : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    ".,width=432 ]    our intention is to represent cts function in @xmath25 based beam routing of symbols .",
    "we employ transition beam routings to explain critical changes that occur due to collisions and sets of particles that are present on each beam routing at every instant description of the machine .",
    "we start with a description of main stages of encoding packages of particles in their initial condition .",
    "this will be an equivalent of beam routing diagram .",
    "we will first show how particles and their collisions emulate a cts in @xmath25 .",
    "we use packages of particles to represent data and operators .",
    "we read , transform and delete data in the tape using reactions between the particles .",
    "the approach is a delicate one and requires a laborious task of setting initial configurations for the particles in the beams .",
    "a diagram of such representation is shown in fig .  [ cts - diagram ] , particular features of the diagram are explain below .",
    "a construction of the cts in @xmath25 can be partitioned , essentially , in three parts :    * first , is the left periodic part , controlled by packages of 4_@xmath90 particles .",
    "this part is static and controls the production of @xmath91 s and @xmath92 s . *",
    "the second part is the center , determining the initial value in the tape . *",
    "the third one is the right cyclic part , which has the data to process , adding a leader component which specifies data added to or erased from the tape in the evolution space .    in the left part , the four packages of @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]c ) particles must be carefully explained because although they are static , their phases change periodically .",
    "the important point is to implement these components in defining both distances and phases , because a distinct phase or a distance induces an undesirable reaction ; in fact all components obey this restriction because every glider of each component must be correctly aligned .    the central part is constituted by an initial 1 on the tape represented by a package of four @xmath93 particles .",
    "this way , an element 1ele@xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]b ) represents a 1 and the element 0ele@xmath94 ( fig .  [ beamroutingr110]a ) represents a 0 in the tape .    the element 0blo@xmath95 is formed by 12@xmath96 particles . for the 1blo@xmath95 element , cook establishes the existence of two components to represent 1 s : 1blop@xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]f ) named _ primary _ and 1blos@xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]g ) named _ standard_. in essence both blocks produce the same element 1add@xmath95 , although coming from different intervals .",
    "the reason to use both blocks is that @xmath25 is not symmetric ; thus , if we use only one element then although we would obtain a good production in the first collision , generating an element 1add@xmath95 , when the second package of 4_@xmath90 particles finds the second block , the system is completely destroyed .",
    "a leader element sepinit@xmath97 ( fig .  [ beamroutingr110]d ) is important in order to separate packages of data and determine their incorporation into of the tape .    the elements 1add@xmath95 ( fig .  [ beamroutingr110]i ) and",
    "0add@xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]h ) are produced by two previous different packages of data .",
    "an element 1add@xmath95 must be generated by a block 1blop@xmath95 or by 1blos@xmath95 .",
    "this way , both elements can produce the same element . while an element 0add@xmath95 is generated by a block 0blo@xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110]e ) .",
    "finally , in terms of periodic phases , this cts can be written as follow :    * \\{@xmath98 - 4@xmath99(f@xmath100 ) } , for @xmath101 in sequential order * @xmath102 - 1ele@xmath103c2(a , f@xmath104_1)-@xmath105-@xmath106(f@xmath104_1 ) * \\{sepinit@xmath97(#,f@xmath107_1)-1blop@xmath95(#,f@xmath107_1)-sepinit@xmath97(#,f@xmath107_1)-1blop@xmath95(#,f@xmath107_1)-0blo@xmath95(#,f@xmath107_1)-1blos@xmath95(#,f@xmath107_1 ) } ( where @xmath108 and # represents a particular phase ) .",

    ", we will use connections between beam routing , as we have proposed in fig  [ beamroutingtransition ] .",
    ".,width=345 ]    transitions between beam routings connect each set of collisions to enter to the next beam routing diagram .",

    "figure  [ ctsbeamrouting ] shows the general diagram to reproduce a cts by particle collisions in @xmath25 with beam routing transitions . while fig .",
    "[ beamroutingr110 ] describes each component to code particles in @xmath25 , fig .",

    "0ele@xmath110 they are compressed only for one dark circle ( that represents the point of collisions ) .",
    "both elements are constituted for four @xmath111 particles in different distances , although they have a static position @xmath62 that can be confined to this dark circle , as @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "when a leader component ( sepinit@xmath97 ) is transformed , given previous binary value on the tape , it collides with @xmath114 component , i.e. a @xmath112 or @xmath113 element .",
    "if @xmath114 is 0 , then a cascade of collisions start to _ delete _ all components that come with three particles successively and change this reaction to reach a new leader component and return to the beginning .",
    "but , if @xmath114 is 1 then a cascade of _ transformations _ dominated by additional particles @xmath62 starts , in order to reach the next leader component . here , we have more variants because pre - transformed package of particles is encoded to binary values that is then included on the machine tape .",
    "if a block of particles is 1blop@xmath95 or 1blos@xmath95 this means that such a component will be transformed to one 1add@xmath95 element .",
    "but , if a block of particles is 0blo@xmath95 , then such a component will be transformed to 0add@xmath95 element . at this stage ,",
    "when both components are prepared then a binary value is introduced on the tape , a 1add@xmath95 element stores a 1 ( 1ele@xmath110 ) , and a 0add@xmath95 element stores a 0 ( 0ele@xmath110 ) , which eventually is deleted for the next leader component and starts a new cycle in the cts machine .",
    "the relevant point here is how to control and code particles by beam routings .",
    "that will offer a better chance to perform a computation with this architecture before implementing the complicated and laborious task of setting up initial condition .",
    "of course , such an idea can be carried out in any ca handling signals , waves , particles , gliders or mobile self - localizations @xcite .",
    "the package particles codification for a cts in @xcite is represented for the expression @xmath115 while that in @xcite is represented for the expression @xmath116 .",
    "finally in all cases , this cts beam routing may simulate such operations .",
    "we advanced a concept of symbol super collider  @xcite and implemented it in one - dimensional cellular automata .",
    "two types of automaton rings were considered  elementary cellular automata ( binary cell state , ternary neighbourhoods ) and elementary cellular automata with memory .",
    "we demonstrated that , for certain rules of cell - state transition functions , the automata exhibit a wide range of particles ( mobile self - localizations or gliders ) in their evolution .",
    "high degree of morphological diversity and richness of collision dynamics of the particles in memory - enriched cellular automata make them particularly promising objects for constructing computational schemes .    in present paper we advanced over twenty years old studies in identifying and classifying gliders and localisations in ca .",
    "there is a number of approaches varying in their degrees of efficiency and discovery potentials .",
    "thus , wuensche successfully classified ca evolution rules with his z parameter , and provided power structures of a substantial number of glider - generating rules  @xcite .",
    "other studies focus on specification of sets of strings as patterns and gliders .",
    "for example , redeker developed a compact algebraic representation of 1d ca evolution , known as _",
    "flexible time_. suing his approach one can construct specific periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "evolution programming techniques are also proved to be very successful , e.g. in situations when a genetic algorithm undertakes a search for gliders and patterns on fixed small arrays of bits  @xcite .",
    "as well , freire _ et .",
    "al _ developed an approach to select specific sets of vectors , initial configurations , that determine development of gliders and localised patterns  @xcite .",
    "finally , the de bruijn diagrams is a time - tested and reliable tool to classify sets of periodic structures or gliders using exhaustive approach  @xcite .",
    "said that in present paper we did not aim to deal with identification of mobile patterns but rather consider glider sets in collision - based computing perspective .",
    "concretely , we only aimed to develop the idea of cyclotrons as an abstract model of super - colliders  @xcite .",
    "we proved experimentally that the dynamics of these particles support all basic types of ballistic collisions and consequently that the cellular automata cyclotrons can be used to implement certain schemes and operations of collision - based computing .",
    "we designed schemes with several beams of particles and provided a means of beam routing and programming interactions between particles . to demonstrate the high degree of computational universality of cellular automaton cyclotrons we took into account that each particle is essentially a finite - size binary string travelling along a one - dimensional lattice ` cyclotron . '",
    "when a string with lower velocity overtaken by a string with higher velocity the content of one or both strings can be modified .",
    "thus , for carefully selected initial configuration of particles and types of particles on a ring , the cellular automaton cyclotron imitates a cyclic tag systems , and thus is computationally universal .    what are advantages of the proposed approach ? in cellular - automaton models particles can run along the rings indefinitely . with suitable beam routing schemes some particles (",
    "the results of computation or the products of reactions ) can be removed from the system and new particles can be added .",
    "the cellular - automaton super collider is a universal computing devices based on interactions between particles due to the particles different speeds .",
    "this give our constructs an enormous advantage when compared to more `` traditional '' constructs , where particles collide only due to different orientations of velocity vectors .",
    "also most existing unconventional designs of universal computing devices have certain issues of boundary conditions , e.g. infinite versus finite , the cellular - automaton super - colliders by using periodic boundary conditions removes the effect of any boundary being equivalent to an infinite periodic system .",
    "the theoretical models of cellular - automaton super colliders open new perspectives in laboratory implementations of collision based computing devices .",
    "the opportunities are virtually endless .",
    "hundreds of chemical , physical and biological systems exhibit travelling localizations in their dynamics .",
    "examples include co - aligned dipole groups in tubulin microtubules ( e.g. @xcite , kinks , breathers and solitons in molecular chains and polymers ( e.g.  @xcite , phasons in quasi - crystals  @xcite , kinks in ferromagnets  @xcite , dissipative solitons in gas - discharge systems  @xcite , localizations of electron density in monolayers of aromatic molecules  @xcite , wave - fragments in excitable chemical media  @xcite .",

    "<S> gliders in one - dimensional cellular automata are compact groups of non - quiescent and non - ether patterns ( ether represents a periodic background ) translating along automaton lattice . </S>",
    "<S> they are cellular - automaton analogous of localizations or quasi - local collective excitations travelling in a spatially extended non - linear medium . </S>",
    "<S> they can be considered as binary strings or symbols travelling along a one - dimensional ring , interacting with each other and changing their states , or symbolic values , as a result of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse what types of interaction occur between gliders travelling on a cellular automaton ` cyclotron ' and build a catalog of the most common reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that collisions between gliders emulate the basic types of interaction that occur between localizations in non - linear media : fusion , elastic collision , and soliton - like collision . </S>",
    "<S> computational outcomes of a swarm of gliders circling on a one - dimensional torus are analysed via implementation of cyclic tag systems . </S>",
