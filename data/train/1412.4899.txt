    "the identity of the dark matter remains a mystery in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "recent observation of a peak in the galactic x - ray spectrum at 3.55 kev @xcite can be interpreted as a signal of the existence of a 7.1 kev dark matter candidate .",
    "this dark matter can decay to produce final state photons which can explain the observed x - ray signal .",
    "a variety of self - consistent models @xcite have been studied to explain the cosmological data as well as the galactic x - ray spectrum and confront them with experiments .",
    "sterile neutrinos can not only be a good candidate for warm dark matter @xcite , but also play an essential role in achieving smallness of neutrino masses @xcite and baryogenesis via leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the sterile neutrino states can mix with the active neutrinos and such admixtures contribute to various processes which are forbidden in the standard model and can affect the interpretations of cosmological and astrophysical observations @xcite . as required from the observation of the galactic x - ray spectrum , they can radiatively produce photons through their mixing with active neutrinos @xcite . thus , the masses of the sterile neutrinos and their mixing with the active neutrinos are subject to current experimental , cosmological and astrophysical constraints as well as the recent observation of the galactic x - ray spectrum .    in ref.@xcite , a model for low scale leptogenesis has been proposed . in the model , tiny neutrino masses",
    "are achieved by introducing extra singlet neutrino on top of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "the extra yukawa couplings between singlet neutrinos allow us to lower the scale of leptogenesis down to tev scale . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this model to investigate whether the extra singlet neutrino with 7.1 kev mass can be a dark matter leading to 3.55 kev photon peak .",
    "we will show how the required size of the mixing parameter between the extra sterile neutrino and active neutrinos can be achieved in the model so as to explain the galactic x - ray spectrum . since the extra singlet neutrino in the model is out of equilibrium for any time after inflation , it must be produced by non - thermal mechanism .",
    "we will show that the light sterile neutrino can be produced via the out - of - equilibrium decay of singlet scalar field @xcite which is initially assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in early universe and then decoupled at the temperature around the scale of singlet scalar mass of order 100 gev .",
    "we do not consider the possible production mechanism of the warm dark matter candidate via neutrino mixing at low temperature @xcite because it is not dominant for the sterile neutrino with mass above 3.5 kev @xcite .",
    "as will be shown later , the coupling between the extra singlet neutrino and singlet scalar plays an important role in achieving low scale leptogenesis and the right amount of relic density for the sterile neutrino as a dark matter .",
    "so in this model , there will be a connection between lepton asymmetry and relic density of dark matter .    in sec .",
    "ii , we set up the model and show how the extra sterile neutrino has mass of around 7.1 kev and that we can get the required size of the mixing angle between the extra sterile neutrino and active neutrinos so as to accommodate the result of the galactic x - ray spectrum . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how low scale leptogenesis can be realized in this model .",
    "iv is devoted to the derivation of the relic density of the extra sterile neutrino as a dark matter . here",
    ", we will discuss how the lepton asymmetry can be connected to the relic density of the extra singlet neutrino . in sec .",
    "v we look at the possible decay channels of the sterile neutrino dark matter candidate and the production of 3.55 kev photon signal . some comments and conclusion will be given in sec .",
    "on top of the seesaw model , we introduce a singlet neutrino , @xmath0 , and a singlet scalar field , @xmath1 .",
    "the mass terms and yukawa interactions in the lagrangian we consider is given in the charged lepton basis as @xcite = m_n_in_i^t n_i+y_d_ij |_i h n_j+ y__i |n_i -^t + h.c .",
    ", where @xmath2 stand for su(2)@xmath3 lepton doublet with flavor index @xmath4 , right - handed singlet neutrino and an su(2)@xmath3 scalar doublet field respectively .",
    "we impose a @xmath5 symmetry under which the fields @xmath1 and @xmath0 are odd and all the other fields are even . this @xmath5 symmetry ,",
    "if unbroken , would immediately imply that the lightest singlet neutrino @xmath0 is stable and can be a dark matter candidate .",
    "this is not strictly true for our model as the @xmath5 symmetry is broken once the scalar singlet @xmath1 gets a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "although @xmath0 is no longer stable , it is still a viable dark matter candidate since its lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe as will be discussed later .    the scalar potential in this model is given as @xcite _ scalar= h^ h+(h^h)^2 + ^2 + ^4+(h^h)^2 . defining the vacuum expectation values of the neutral component of @xmath6 and @xmath1 fields as @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , we expand the fields as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this gives us a @xmath11 mass squared matrix for the scalar fields given as    _",
    "h v^2&_huv + _",
    "huv&2_u^2    .",
    "assuming @xmath12 we get the eigenvalues of this mass squared matrix as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scalar mixing angle given as = .",
    "for @xmath1 to be an appropriate candidate to act as the heat bath we should have @xmath15 @xcite . on the other hand we need to make sure that its mixing with the higgs boson is small enough to not effect the higgs signals .",
    "we thus choose @xmath16 .",
    "for such a small @xmath17 , we can easily neglect its contribution to the masses of the scalars given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar ] ) .",
    "the mass of the standard model like higgs boson is @xmath18 gev for @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 .",
    "we choose the vacuum expectation value of the scalar singlet @xmath21 gev , and @xmath22 which gives @xmath23 gev as a benchmark point for achieving right amount of relic density for the dark matter candidate .",
    "let us now focus our attention to the neutrino sector in this model .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in the basis @xmath24 is given as @xcite m_= (    ccc 0 & m_d_ij & 0 + m_d_ij & m_n_ii & m__i + 0 & m__i & -    ) , [ massmatrix ] where @xmath25 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath26 . after integrating out the right - handed heavy neutrino sector @xmath27 in the above lagrangian , and block diagonalization of the effective mass terms ,",

    "on the other hand , the sterile neutrino mass is approximately given as @xmath30 we further assume that @xmath31 and then , the mixing angles @xmath32 and the sterile neutrino mass @xmath33 are approximately given by 2 _ & & 2 _ , [ mixing ] + m _ & & [ sterile2 ] taking @xmath34 kev , the sterile neutrino is regarded as dark matter leading to 3.55 kev peak of the galactic x - ray spectrum . then , we see from eq.([dsw ] ) that @xmath35 for @xmath36 ev corresponding to the atmospheric ( solar ) neutrino mass scale in the hierarchical spectrum . to achieve low scale leptogenesis ,",
    "it is desirable to take the lightest @xmath37 to be a few tev .",
    "once we take @xmath38 tev , we are led from eq.([mixing ] ) to _ ~()^2 .",
    "[ s - mixing ] in order for the sterile neutrino to be the dark matter with mass @xmath39 kev , it is required @xmath40 @xcite . combining this constraint with eq.([s - mixing ] ) , the scale of @xmath41 is determined to be around @xmath42 mev , and thus @xmath43 to be 70(50 ) kev .",
    "those scales of @xmath43 and @xmath41 are achieved by taking @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively for @xmath46 gev and @xmath47 gev .",
    "when we take @xmath37 to be less 10 tev , then we get smaller @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we note that such a small mixing angle @xmath32 between sterile and active neutrinos ensures that sterile neutrinos were never in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and this allows their abundance to be smaller than the predictions in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , the right abundance of the sterile neutrino should be achieved not by thermal production frozen out below sterile neutrino mass but production via freeze - in decay of the scalar @xmath1 as will be shown in section [ dmp ] .",
    "now , let us consider how low scale leptogenesis can be successfully achieved in our scenario by the decay of the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino before the scalar fields get vacuum expectation values . we take the basis where the mass terms @xmath50 and @xmath29 are real and diagonal .",

    "in addition to the diagrams of the standard leptogensis scenario @xcite , there is a new contribution of the diagram which corresponds to the self energy correction of the vertex arisen due to the yukawa interaction @xmath58 , so that the lepton number asymmetry is given by @xmath59{\\cal t}_{k1 } + g_s(x_k){\\cal s}_{k1}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath60\\}$ ] , @xmath61 with @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64   \\over ( y_d^\\dagger y_d)_{11 } + |y_{\\chi_1}|^2}\\ ] ] and @xmath65   \\over ( y_d^\\dagger y_d)_{11 } + |y_{\\chi_1}|^2}.\\ ] ] as shown in @xcite , the new contributions to @xmath66 could be important for the case of @xmath67 for which the asymmetry is approximately given by @xmath68 }             { ( y_d^\\dagger y_d)_{11}+|y_{\\chi_1}|^2 }          + \\frac { im[(y_dy^{\\dagger}_d)_{21}(y_{\\chi_2}y_{\\chi_1}^{\\dagger } ) ] }                     { ( y_d^\\dagger y_d)_{11}+|y_{\\chi}|^2}\\right]r~ ,                     \\label{epsilon2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a resonance factor defined by @xmath70 are suppressed . for successful leptogenesis , the size of the denominator of @xmath66 should be constrained by the out - of - equilibrium condition , @xmath71 with the hubble expansion rate @xmath6 , from which the corresponding upper bound on the couplings @xmath72 reads @xmath73 however , the size of @xmath74 is not constrained by the out - of - equilibrium condition , so large value of @xmath74 is allowed for which the second term of eq .",
    "( [ epsilon2 ] ) can dominate over the first one and thus the size of @xmath66 can be enhanced .",
    "taking @xmath75 with constant @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the upper limit of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ epsilon2 ] ) is given in terms of @xmath78 by @xmath79 .",
    "the generated b - l asymmetry is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath1 is the efficient factor and @xmath81 is the number density of the right - handed heavy neutrino in thermal equilibrium at high temperature given by @xmath82 with boltzmann constant @xmath83 and the effective number of degree of freedom @xmath84 .",
    "in this model , the new process of type @xmath85 generated through virtual @xmath86 exchange will dominantly contribute to @xmath1 . to a good approximation",
    ", the efficiency factor can be easily estimated by replacing @xmath57 in the case of the typical seesaw model with @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "then , successful leptogenesis can be achieved for @xmath88 gev , provided that @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which alleviate the severe fine - tuning for the mass difference between @xmath57 and @xmath91 required for resonant leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "note that the choice of parameters as above is similar to the case of the typical seesaw model with @xmath92 gev and the effective neutrino mass @xmath93 ev for successful leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "now , let us investigate how the relic abundance of the singlet neutrino , @xmath0 , as a kev dark matter can be achieved . since we assume that the yukawa couplings @xmath72 is very small so as to achieve small neutrino masses as well as tiny mixing angle between sterile neutrino and active neutrino , the interactions with the couplings @xmath72 were never in thermal equilibrium in early universe .",
    "as shown before , in order to achieve low scale leptogenesis , large values of @xmath74 is essential , so the interactions with @xmath74 may play an crucial role in achieving right amount of relic abundance . in this work , we will show that the relic abundance of @xmath0 can be achieved via so - called freeze - in process through out of equilibrium decay of the scalar @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the decays of @xmath1 into a pair of @xmath0 can occur via the interaction term generated after heavy majorana neutrino @xmath86 decoupled and @xmath1 got vacuum expectation value , @xmath94 .",
    "we consider the possibility that the scalar interactions of @xmath1 with sm higgs @xmath6 keep @xmath1 in equilibrium down to a rather low temperature of @xmath95 , so that @xmath1 remains in thermal equilibrium and behaves as a bath particle above that .",
    "the decay width of @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 that decay process happens out of equilibrium at @xmath98 .",
    "then the abundance of @xmath0 becomes so flat that it can give rise to right amount of the relic density .",
    "the relic density of @xmath0 is obtained by solving the boltzmann equation for @xmath99 @xcite , + 3 h n _ = d _ d_2 d_3(2)^4^(4)(p_-p_2-p_3 ) _ spin|m|^2 _ f _ , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the momentum of the outgoing particles , @xmath102 and the initial abundance of @xmath0 is assumed to be negligible so that we can set @xmath103 . using the definition of the partial decay width for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , given in eq.([decay - eta ] ) , we can rewrite the above equation as follows ; + 3 h n _ & = & 2 + & = & de _",
    "e^-e_/t + & = & t k_1(m_/t ) , where @xmath106 is the first modified bessel function of second kind . here",
    "we have used the maxwell - boltzmann approximation @xmath107 . rewriting in terms of the yield , @xmath108 , = - , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 . using @xmath111 ,",
    "y_^x_max_x_k_1(x ) x^3 dx taking @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we can get y _ ( ) _ h^2 |y__2|^4    for a decoupling temperature of around 70 gev , as is the case here , we can easily take @xmath114 to a very good approximation . calculating the number of degrees of freedom we get @xmath115 in this case .",
    "thus , the formula for the relic density can easily give us the desired value of @xmath116 @xcite for our preferred choice of parameters given as @xmath117 gev , @xmath118 gev , @xmath119 , @xmath120 tev and @xmath121 kev .",
    "this shows that we can easily generate the required lepton asymmetry and the correct relic density with a relatively low seesaw scale in this model .",
    "we would like to further investigate whether the sterile neutrino dark matter in this model behaves as a warm or cold dark matter candidate .",
    "a knowledge of its free - streaming length , though does not provide the entire picture , can give us some indication towards our goal .",
    "the free streaming length depends not only on its mass but also on the production mechanism of the dark matter particle @xcite .",
    "the frozen - in production mechanism at @xmath122gev leads to a much colder dark matter candidate compared to typical warm dark matter production via dodelson - widrow mechanism @xcite .",
    "this is also true for our model where the sterile neutrino dark matter candidate has a shorter free streaming length than typical warm dark matter but still is much larger than that of cold dark matter .",
    "a detailed analysis of the free - streaming length or the determination of the velocity profile for the dark matter is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry introduced in the model is broken when the scalar field @xmath1 gets a vacuum expectation value . as a result",
    "the dark matter candidate is no longer stable and can decay .",
    "the only possible decay channels for the scalar dark matter @xmath0 would be into three active neutrinos or into an active neutrino along with the emission of a photon @xcite .        the primary decay channel for the final state with three active neutrinos is shown in fig .  [ fig:3nu ] .",
    "the decay width for this process is given as @xmath123 where @xmath124 @xmath125 is the fermi constant , @xmath126 is the mass of the dark matter candidate and @xmath32 is the mixing angle between the singlet @xmath0 and the active neutrinos .",
    "the processes for the radiative decay of the dark matter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nugamma ] .        in these processes ,",
    "the final state is a neutrino accompanied by the radiative emission of a photon with an energy of @xmath127 .",
    "if the mass of the dark matter particle is 7.1 kev , the emitted photon will have an energy of 3.55 kev .",
    "this can easily explain the recent observation of a 3.55 kev x - ray line signal detected in the andromeda galaxy and many other galaxies including the perseus galaxy .",
    "the decay width for these processes are inversely proportional to the mass of the charged lepton inside the loop and hence an electron would produce a much stronger limit on the lifetime of the dark matter particle .",
    "the smallness of the electron yukawa coupling implicates that the contribution from the first pair of diagrams which involve the gauge interactions far exceed the contribution form the other pair involving yukawa interactions .",
    "considering the masses of the @xmath128 boson and the higgs boson being of the same order the second pair of diagrams are suppressed by a factor of @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the electron yukawa coupling and @xmath133 is the @xmath134 gauge coupling .",
    "hence the first pair of diagrams are the ones which provide any meaningful limit on the dark matter lifetime for its radiative decay",
    ".    the combined decay width for the radiative decay processes involving the gauge couplings is given as @xmath135    thus one can see that for @xmath126= 7.1 kev and @xmath136 the decay width will be @xmath137 which leads to a lifetime much larger than the age of the universe .",
    "hence the dark matter can be considered to be relatively stable in the time frame of our universe s age .",
    "in this work we consider a simple extension of the standard model with an extra singlet scalar ( @xmath1 ) , a singlet fermion ( @xmath0 ) and heavy right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "this model can consistently explain the light neutrino masses along with the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the baryon asymmetry is generated through leptogenesis , the lepton asymmetry being generated by the decay of a heavy neutrino . a new contribution corresponding to the self energy correction of the heavy neutrino",
    "helps in generating the required lepton asymmetry at low scale",
    ". the yukawa interactions between singlet neutrino @xmath0 and @xmath139 can play an important role in connecting this low scale leptogenesis with the relic density of the kev dark matter candidate . in this model ,",
    "the singlet fermion @xmath0 can be identified as a dark matter candidate of mass 7.1 kev .",
    "it decays with a lifetime much larger than the age of the universe , producing a final state photon with @xmath140 .",
    "this explains the recently observed 3.55 kev photon signal from the galactic center .",
    "we present a benchmark point of the unknown parameter set for which the required lepton asymmetry and relic density of the kev dark matter can be obtained .",
    "thus we have presented here a simple extension of the standard model which can connect the smallness of the neutrino mass , baryon asymmetry of the universe and the recently observed 3.55 kev photon signal under a single framework .",
    "the model also provides a good dark matter candidate with the correct relic density .",

    "<S> we consider a simple extension of the standard model to consistently explain the observation of a peak in the galactic x - ray spectrum at 3.55 kev and the light neutrino masses along with the baryon asymmetry of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon asymmetry is generated through leptogenesis , the lepton asymmetry being generated by the decay of a heavy neutrino with tev mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> the extra singlet fermion introduced in the model can be identified as a dark matter candidate of mass 7.1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> it decays with a lifetime much larger than the age of the universe , producing a final state photon . </S>",
    "<S> the yukawa interactions between the extra singlet neutrino and a heavier right - handed neutrino play a crucial role in simultaneously achieving low scale leptogenesis and relic density of the kev dark matter candidate . </S>"
