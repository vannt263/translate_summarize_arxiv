    "recent advances of micro - sensor fabrication technology allow for producing cheap and small sensor nodes with wireless communication capabilities . consequently , wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) become an economically sound solution to wide range of applications such as environmental and wildlife habitat monitoring , target tracking for defense purposes , and health care @xcite .",
    "typical wsn consists of large number of sensor nodes deployed in an area of interest to collect specific information about the surrounding environment .",
    "the need for large number of sensor nodes in wsns while being cost - effective constraints the industry standards to produce battery - powered sensor nodes with simple hardware . as a result of the limited energy and processing capabilities of sensor nodes ,",
    "the collected information has to be sent to a fusion center ( fc ) for centralized processing .",
    "one important application of wsns is the distributed estimation of scalar parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . in such application ,",
    "sensor nodes transmit their observations over a multiple access channel ( mac ) to the fc .",
    "the received signal is distorted by the channel fading and the additive noise .",
    "the fc is required to reconstruct the source parameter with minimum mean - square error ( mse ) .",
    "depending on the available information about the source statistics , different estimators can be used to achieve the mse criterion .",
    "the performance of the best linear unbiased estimation ( blue ) @xcite , minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) estimator @xcite , and maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) @xcite are studied in literature .",
    "both orthogonal mac @xcite and coherent mac @xcite are considered in the distributed estimation problem .",
    "assuming gaussian source signal and noise , amplify - and - forward schemes significantly outperform the traditional source - channel coding for both multiple access channels @xcite .",
    "optimal power allocation for sensor nodes under different constraints is addressed in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the distortion is also studied in @xcite .",
    "the mse performance for the coherent mac asymptotically approaches to zero as the number of sensors increases to infinity .",
    "however , this is not the case for the orthogonal mac where the mse reaches a finite non - zero value as the number of sensor nodes increases @xcite .",
    "diversity order of estimation distortion is introduced in @xcite and shown to be given by the number of sensors .    in most wsn applications ,",
    "the source parameter is a physical quantity like temperature , pressure , humidity , sound , ... etc .",
    "therefore , the sensor node observations are correlated where the correlation coefficient is exponentially decaying with distance . in literature , simple signal models were usually assumed .",
    "for example , unity correlated observations are assumed in @xcite , where sensor nodes measure a noisy version of the source signal .",
    "the correlation between the observations and the source signal ( denoted hereafter as the source - node correlation ) is considered in @xcite .",
    "however , in this model the correlation between observations ( denoted hereafter as the inter - node correlation ) is determined by the source - node correlation as we will show later . considering a correlation model with inter - node correlation that determined by the distance between sensor nodes",
    "is a more realistic assumption @xcite .    in this paper , we study the distributed estimation of a scalar parameter where sensor nodes transmit their observations to the fc over a coherent mac . the observations are spatially correlated and corrupted by noise . moreover , the communication channel is subject to fading and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the fc uses the received signal to estimate the source parameter using lmmse estimator . the distance - based correlation model of @xcite",
    "is used in this paper to characterize the source - node correlation and the inter - node correlation .",
    "the effect of the distance - based correlation on the estimation performance is demonstrated and compared with the case of unity correlated observations .",
    "the outage probability is adopted as the performance measure .",
    "a new closed - form expression for the outage probability in terms of quadratic forms is introduced .",
    "it is shown that less correlated observations degrade the performance .",
    "hereafter , small letters , bold small letters , and bold capital letters will designate scalars , vectors , and matrices , respectively .",
    "if @xmath0 is a matrix , then @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denote the hermitian , the transpose , and the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we define @xmath4 to be a diagonal matrix formed from vector @xmath5 .",

    "consider a wsn consisting of @xmath9 sensor nodes and a fc as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "sensor nodes are required to observe a scalar parameter modeled by a zero - mean complex gaussian random variable @xmath10 .",
    "the signals measured by individual sensor nodes can be described as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13th sensor node observation and @xmath14 is the observation noise .",
    "the signals @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are modeled as zero - mean joint gaussian random variables , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the source - node correlation coefficient between @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , sensor node observations @xmath16 , are correlated to each other , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inter - node correlation coefficient between @xmath12 and @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation coefficients are non - negative and decrease monotonically with distance . using the power exponential model presented in @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , according to the relation @xmath25 where @xmath23 is the distance between the event source and the @xmath13th node , @xmath24 is distance between sensor @xmath13 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the model parameters , where @xmath28 normalizes the distance and @xmath29 controls the correlation decay rate . let us define the matrix @xmath30 as the cross - node correlation matrix with @xmath21 is the element at the @xmath13th row and @xmath26th column . assuming random sensor node locations , @xmath30 will be a full - rank matrix , and therefore this model will be referred to as _ full - rank _ correlation model .",
    "the aforementioned model for the correlation coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath21 is more generalized than the one used in @xcite where the signal is given as @xmath32 , and thus @xmath33 in this case .",
    "this results in _ unity _ correlated source and observations , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 . also , the signal model used in @xcite is @xmath37 which corresponds to @xmath38 in eq .",

    "for the amplify - and - forward scheme , the transmitted signal from the @xmath13th sensor node is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the amplification factor . here",
    ", the transmit power for each node is @xmath46 .",
    "assume that the channel state information ( csi ) is available at the fc .",
    "then , the coherent combining of the transmitted signals received at the fc is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the communication noise @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the rayleigh fading for the @xmath13th node @xmath51 .",
    "given the signal and channel statistics , the lmmse estimate @xmath52 can be expressed as @xmath53 and the corresponding distortion becomes @xmath54    the normalized distortion @xmath55 is then given by eq .",

    "are the result of the inter - node correlation .",
    "in this section , the special cases of unity correlation and rank - one model are compared to full - rank model . for simplicity ,",

    ", it is apparent that @xmath64 and @xmath65 as the number of sensor nodes goes to infinity .",
    "however , @xmath66 does not vanish under the same condition .",
    "the effect of correlation on the distortion when the number of sensor nodes increases is depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "( [ asymptoticd1 ] ) , ( [ asymptoticd2 ] ) , and ( [ asymptoticd3 ] ) are averaged over 1000 random realization of sensor node locations and plotted for increasing @xmath9 . here",
    ", the observation signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is defined as @xmath67 = 20  db and the communication snr as @xmath68 = 20  db , where @xmath69 .",
    "the correlation model has @xmath28 = 250 and @xmath29 = 1 .",
    "the total transmit power of all sensor nodes is @xmath58 = 10 db ( normalized to @xmath70 ) .",
    "as expected , the distortion for the unity correlated case tends to zero as @xmath9 increases .",
    "the same behavior is noticed for the rank - one model , however with slightly higher distortion in this case .",
    "conversely , the distortion for full - rank model exhibit a floor behavior at a non - zero distortion ( @xmath71 0.182 ) .",
    "therefore , correlation between observations should be taken into consideration when designing distributed estimation schemes because weak correlation degrades its performance .",
    "the normalized distortion in eq .",
    "( [ normdes ] ) depends on the channel fading , correlation coefficients , channel and measurement noise power , and amplification factors .",
    "given the distance - based correlation model , the correlation coefficients will be invariable for specific network geometry . therefore , with fixed power allocation and noise power ,",
    "the channel fading is the only determining factor for the fluctuation in the estimation distortion . in many applications ,",
    "the interest is to characterize the maximum distortion rather than the average distortion . in such situations ,",
    "the outage probability is used as a performance measure where the outage refers to the event at which a desired performance level can not be satisfied . here",
    ", the outage probability is defined as the probability that the normalized distortion exceeds a certain value @xmath72 , @xmath73    to find a closed - form expression for the outage probability , we first express the distortion in vector form .",
    "let us define the vectors @xmath74^{t}$ ] , @xmath75^{t}$ ] , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 as defined previously .",
    "it follows that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . also , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "then the normalized distortion can be expressed in terms of indefinite quadratic forms as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "accordingly , the outage probability takes the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 . using the results of @xcite",
    ", the outage probability @xmath91 can be expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the heaviside unit - step function .",
    "this expression can be simplified if @xmath96 is substituted by its component matrices , @xmath97 where the last approximation results from considering that @xmath98 .",
    "recall that the matrix @xmath99 is the outer product of the vector @xmath100 by itself , hence it is of rank one and positive semidefinite .",
    "moreover , @xmath101 is also positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 has only one non - negative eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues can simply canceled off in ( [ outagepreqn1 ] ) because of the unit - step function .",
    "finally , the expression of outage probability simplifies to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the only non - negative eigenvalue of @xmath94 . using weyl s inequality @xcite",
    ", this eigenvalue can be lower bounded by @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the largest eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath99 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the outage probability depends on the eigenvalues of @xmath107 ( exact expression ) or the eigenvalues of @xmath99 and @xmath101 ( lower bound ) .",
    "assume equal power allocation , one has @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the factor reflecting the effect of the correlation on the largest eigenvalue and it depends on the geometry of the wsn . considering that the term @xmath110 is constant for specific network setting",
    ", the factor @xmath111 will be referred to as the normalized eigenvalue .",
    "the outage probability in this case is expressed as @xmath112 clearly , the outage probability is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath111 and thus related to the signal and observations correlation .",
    "in this section , the analytic results are confirmed by numerical simulations . consider a wsn that consists of @xmath9 = 10 sensor nodes randomly located in a square area with side length of @xmath113  m. it is required to estimate a source parameter located @xmath114  m away from the center of the sensor nodes .",
    "the settings of fig .  2 are assumed for all the following simulations unless otherwise stated .",
    "moreover , the channel fading has variance @xmath115 .",
    "all simulation results are averaged over 1000 independent runs .",
    "3 shows the outage probability vs. the normalized distortion .",
    "the analytic expressions are plotted with solid , dashed , and dotted lines and the simulations are plotted with circle , diamond , and plus marks . the closed - form expression is shown to be in perfect match with the simulation results and the accuracy of the closed - form approximation of the outage probability is verified .",
    "the correlation clearly affects the outage performance where more outage occurs for both distance - based correlation models .",
    "note that for the full - rank model , @xmath116 for @xmath117 with values less than @xmath71 0.182 ( i.e. the distortion is always larger than this value ) which agrees with the results of fig .  2 .",
    "4 compares between the exact expression for the largest eigenvalue ( normalized by @xmath118 ) and its approximation in eq .",
    "( 17 ) for different source locations .",
    "the source distance to the center of the square area is set to 50  m , 30  m , and 0  m. note that @xmath119 is upper bounded by @xmath118 since @xmath120    recall that the outage probability is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath121 and situations with larger eigenvalue corresponds to a better outage performance ( i.e. lower outage probability ) . from the figure , we conclude that observing farther source reduces the largest eigenvalue and thus increases the outage probability .",
    "in this paper , distributed estimation of a scalar parameter in wsns is considered .",
    "correlated source signal and observations are assumed and the effect of correlation is investigated . a closed - form expression for the outage probability",
    "is derived to link between the correlation and the outage performance .",
    "it is shown that higher distortion levels occurs with higher probability when assuming correlated observations as compared to unity correlated ones .",
    "moreover , the distortion does not vanish when increasing the number of sensor nodes indefinitely for the distance - based correlation .",
