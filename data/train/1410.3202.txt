    "strongly correlated electron systems show a variety of intriguing phenomena like unconventional and/or high - temperature superconductivity , spin and charge ordering , formation of heavy fermions , non - trivial ( kondo ) semiconducting behavior , and quantum criticality . among them , such yb - based single - crystalline compounds as ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath3  @xcite showing the quantum criticality in ambient pressure , a kondo semiconductor ybb@xmath4  @xcite , valence - fluctuating ybal@xmath5",
    "@xcite and ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite , and a very heavy fermionic ybco@xmath1zn@xmath6  @xcite have been synthesized with excellent quality and thus intensively studied within a couple of decades . since the strong coulomb repulsion ( effective value of 6 - 10 ev ) works between the 4@xmath7 electrons in the yb sites , an ionic picture is a good starting point to discuss and reveal their electronic structure as well as the origins of various phenomena in the crystalline solids .",
    "the majority of the yb ions in the above - mentioned materials is in trivalent 4@xmath8 ( one 4@xmath7 hole ) configurations although there are to some extent yb@xmath9 ( 4@xmath10 ) components due to the hybridization between the 4f orbitals and other valence - band states crossing the fermi level .",
    "the yb@xmath11 @xmath0 levels are split by the spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath12 ev ) and further split by the crystalline electric field ( cef , from a few to several tens mev ) in solids as shown in fig .",
    "[ bothld](a ) .",
    "ground - state @xmath7-orbital symmetry determined by the cef splitting is very fundamental information of the realistic strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "in contrast to the case of transition - metal oxides in which the electron correlations work among the @xmath13-orbital electrons , the ground - state symmetry is not straightforward revealed since it is unclear which sites act as effective _",
    "`` ligands '' _ for the @xmath7 sites .",
    "a standard experimental technique for determining the 4@xmath7 levels with their symmetry is to analyze the inelastic neutron scattering spectra and anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility of single crystals .",
    "however , the magnetic 4@xmath7 - 4@xmath7 excitations are often hampered by the phonon excitations with the same energy scale .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to uniquely determine the symmetry of all @xmath7 levels by the analysis of the magnetic anisotropy since there are too many free parameters for a unique description of the cef potential . actually , the ground - state 4@xmath7-orbital symmetry is not clear for here reported ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 and ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1 although a couple of possible solutions have been proposed .",
    "polarized neutron scattering  @xcite for large single crystals is principally powerful to determine the @xmath7-orbital symmetry , but time - consuming .",
    "recently linear dichroism ( ld ) in the 3@xmath13-to-4@xmath7 soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas )  @xcite for single crystals has been reported for the heavy fermion systems with nearly ce@xmath11 ( @xmath14 ) configurations as a powerful tool to determine the 4@xmath7 ground state owing to the dipole selection rules .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply this technique to probe the yb@xmath11 states since there is only single - peak structure ( @xmath15 final state ) at the @xmath16 absorption edge . on the other hand , the selection rules work also in the photoemission process while the excited electron energy is much higher than that in the absorption process .",
    "we have discovered that the atomic - like multiplet - split structure in the core - level photoemission spectra shows easily detectable ld reflecting the outer 4@xmath7 spatial distribution probed by the created core hole . in this letter , we demonstrate that the 4@xmath7-orbital symmetry of the ground state for ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 and ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1 in tetragonal symmetry is determined by the ld in the yb 3@xmath17 core - level photoemission , and further that the excited - state @xmath0 symmetry is also probed by the temperature - dependent data .",

    "there are a single peak at the binding energy of @xmath281520 ev and a multiple - peak structure ranging from 1525 to 1535 ev in all spectra .",
    "since the 4@xmath7 subshell is fully occupied in the yb@xmath9 sites with spherically symmetric 4@xmath7 distribution , the former single peak is ascribed to the yb@xmath9 states .",

    "than in the p - polarization configuration ( p - pol . )",
    "whereas a structure with the 1529.5-ev peak and 1530.5-ev shoulder is stronger in the p - pol . for both compounds .",
    "possible photoelectron diffraction effects are ruled out of the origin of ld based on the fact that the degree of ld is mutually different between both compounds with the same thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 crystal structure .    to clarify the origin of ld in the yb@xmath11 @xmath21 core - level haxpes spectra , we have performed ionic calculations including the full multiplet theory  @xcite and the local cef splitting using the xtls 9.0 program  @xcite .",
    "all atomic parameters such as the 4@xmath7 - 4@xmath7 and 3@xmath13 - 4@xmath7 coulomb and exchange interactions ( slater integrals ) and the 3@xmath13 and 4@xmath7 spin - orbit couplings have been obtained by cowan s code  @xcite based on the hartree - fock method .",
    "the slater integrals ( spin - orbit couplings ) are reduced down to 88% ( 98% ) to fit the core - level photoemission spectra  @xcite .",
    "we show the polarization - dependent core - level spectra at @xmath35 for pure @xmath36 states of the yb@xmath11 ions with @xmath37 in fig.[bothld](d ) .",
    "ld depends strongly on @xmath38 , reflecting the coulomb interactions between the 3@xmath13 and 4@xmath7 holes with anisotropic spatial distributions in the final state .",
    "the result of the simulations tells us that the observed ld in the core - level haxpes spectra originates from the anisotropic 4@xmath7 hole distribution under cef in the initial state .    in the case of yb@xmath11 ions in tetragonal symmetry ,",
    "the eightfold degenerate @xmath39 state splits into four doublets as @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 defining the actual charge distributions , and cef splitting energies depend on the cef parameters @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in stevens formalism  @xcite .",
    "since all cef splitting energies are highly expected to be much larger ( @xmath44 k ) than the measured temperature of 14 k for ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite and ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite , it is justified to assume that only the lowest state is populated . as shown in fig.[bothld](d ) , ld is qualitatively different between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where lds for @xmath47 and 3/2 are qualitatively consistent with those for the experimental data",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the 4@xmath7-orbital symmetry of the ground states as well as that of the excited states in the yb compounds is probed by the ld in the core - level haxpes and its @xmath19 dependence . the ground - state symmetry is unambiguously determined by the ld under the sole assumption that only the lowest state is populated .",
    "ld in the core - level haxpes has the advantage over ld in xas in discriminating the same shape of the 4@xmath7 charge distributions with in - plane rotation as shown for ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1 owing to the experimental parameter @xmath19 in addition to the polarization .",
    "the discrimination of the in - plane rotation of charge distribution is also feasible by the polarization - dependent non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering  @xcite , but the throughput and energy resolution are much better for ld in the core - level haxpes .",

    "<S> we show that the strongly correlated @xmath0-orbital symmetry of the ground state is revealed by linear dichroism in core - level photoemission spectra as we have discovered for ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 and ybcu@xmath1si@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical analysis tells us that the linear dichroism reflects the anisotropic charge distributions resulting from crystalline electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully determined the ground - state @xmath0 symmetry for both compounds from the polarization - dependent _ angle - resolved _ core - level spectra at a low temperature well below the first excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> the excited - state symmetry is also probed by temperature dependence of the linear dichroism where the high measuring temperatures are of the order of the crystal - field - splitting energies . </S>"
