    "<S> we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of anyons in three dimensional @xmath0 model with a chern - simons term in various limits in @xmath1 expansion . we have found that for anyons of infinite mass the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath2-factor ) is 2 up to the next - to - leading order in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our result supports a recent claim that the @xmath2-factor of nonrelativistic anyons is exactly two . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that for @xmath3 , the electromagnetic interation between two identical aynons of large mass are attractive .    0.2 in    pacs numbers : 13.40.fn , 11.10.lm , 11.15.pg    -0.5 cm -1.0 cm by 3    =    0.35 in * anomalous magnetic moment of anyons + in three dimensional @xmath0 model *    .1 in deog ki hong    department of physics , pusan national university + pusan 609 - 735 , korea +    .1 in jin young kim    division of basic sciences , dongseo university + pusan 616 - 010 , korea +    .1 in    one of the peculiarities of planar physics is that there exists a particle of arbitrary spin , called anyon , since the rotation group in the two - dimensional space is @xmath4 . in field theories , anyon can be realized by minimally coupling a boson or a fermion to chern - simons gauge fields@xcite . due to the coupling to the chern - simons gauge fields , the wave function of two identical particles gets an aharonov - bohm phase , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coefficient of the chern - simons term in the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> since the aharonov - bohm phase is interpreted as a statistical phase , the particle gets an induced spin , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> anyon has been studied extensively because of its possible application to some of the planar condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that anyon matter exhibits superconductivity@xcite and describes quantum hall system@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to study the many - body effects of anyons , one needs to find out how they interact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> besides the statistical interaction due to the chern - simons fields , anyons may interact electro - magnetically . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the interaction between its magnetic moment and electric charge can be very important since it may lead to a bound state of anyon and a magnetic flux tube@xcite , which is introduced by jain@xcite to describe fractional quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the sign of the magnetic moment of anyon , the interaction of identical anyons could be attractive while the electric charge - charge interaction is always repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a certain value of the coefficient of the chern - simons term , two identical anyons can form a bound state . </S>",
    "<S> finding out the exact value of the magnetic moment of anyon is therefore of some importance .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been several calculations on the magnetic moment of anyon . </S>",
    "<S> chou _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ showed that the @xmath2-factor of nonrelativistic anyonic particles is exactly two @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , in field theoretical models , it is shown that in the pure anyonic limit ( namely for large value of the coefficient of the chern - simons term ) the gyromagnetic ratio of anyon at one - loop is @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the coefficient of the chern - simons term@xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the magnetic moment of anyons in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 model with a chern - simons term@xcite and we try to see if we reproduce the chou _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> s result for anyons of large mass . for @xmath9 , the model was originally studied to describe the high @xmath10 superconductivity @xcite , since the model appears as a long - wavelength limit of the hubbard model near half - filling@xcite .    the @xmath0 model with a chern - simons term </S>",
    "<S> is described by a lagrangian density ( in the euclidean notation ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the covariant derivative @xmath13 . in the original @xmath0 model without the chern - simons term , the vector field @xmath14 is an auxiliarly field satisfying the constraint @xmath15 which reduces the independent components of the complex fields @xmath16 by 2 together with the constraint on the  length square \" of @xmath16 , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> but , as is well known , the quantum corrections generate a kinetic term for @xmath14 . with the chern - simons term </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 model behaves quite differently from the original one . the added chern - simons term in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) not only makes the vector field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 propagte even at the classical level but also provides an induced fractional spin to @xmath16 by the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .    in the @xmath1 perturbation , </S>",

    "<S> the flavor symmetry breaks down to @xmath25 , leaving @xmath26 massless nambu - goldstone bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of anyons described by ( [ lagrangian ] ) in the symmetric phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the magnetic moment of a particle can be infered from the on - shell matrix element of the effective interaction hamiltonian under a ( spatially ) uniform external magnetic field ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element of the current of a scalar field is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 corresponds to the electric charge form factor . for a constant magnetic field , @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily see that , as @xmath34 , @xmath35 therefore @xmath36 is the magnetic moment of a scalar field which couples minimally to photon . </S>",
    "<S> there are seven diagrams , shown in fig.1 , which are leading order corrections in @xmath1 to the vertex function . by lorentz invariance , the diagram ( b ) must be proportional to @xmath37 , which is then zero due to the current conservation . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) are zero by explicit calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram ( e ) in fig.1 vanishes identically , because of the symmetry of the lagrangian under @xmath38 , @xmath39 , which is similar to furry s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> finally , one can easily see that the parity - odd parts of the diagrams ( f ) and ( g ) are zero by the similar argument used to prove the coleman - hill theorem on non - renormalization of the chern - simons term @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram ( f ) gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the propagator for the gauge fields and @xmath42 is the propagator for @xmath43 field . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is the one - loop effective @xmath45 vertex . because of the current conservation and the analyticity of the vertex , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is analytic at the zero momenta . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the effecive vertex is analytic at the vanishing external momenta , since the @xmath21 fields are massive . ) since in the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diaf ] ) @xmath44 is contracted with the gauge field propagator @xmath41 , only the parity - even part of the propagator survives in the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diaf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the only diagram which has a nonvanishing parity - odd part is diagram ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the magnetic moment is parity - odd , it is the only diagram that contributes to the magnetic moment of anyon in the leading order in @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ moment ] ) is the exact magnetic moment of @xmath21 fields in the @xmath0 model with a chern - simons term . </S>",
    "<S> since it is not easy to perform the integration , we consider two extreme cases where @xmath59 the mass of @xmath21 fields is very large ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 very small ( @xmath62 ) . in these limits </S>",
    "<S> the parity - odd part of chern - simons propagator becomes for each cases @xmath63 repeating calculations with these propagators , we get @xmath64 since the induced spin of @xmath21 fields is @xmath65 , the gyromagnetic ratio is for each limiting cases @xmath66 we see here that in the non - relativistic limit ( namely in the heavy mass limit , @xmath60 ) the @xmath2-factor of anyons is two at the leading order in the @xmath1 expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the next - to - leading corrections to the magnetic moment when the mass of anyon goes to infinity to see if the @xmath2-factor of heavy anyon does not get corrections in higher orders in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the next - leading order diagrams in @xmath1 for the vertex function are shown in fig.2 . since in the large @xmath67 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the gauge field propagator becomes @xmath68 the contribution of the parity - even part of the gauge field propagator is suppressed by @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the large @xmath67 limit , one may neglect the parity - even part of the gauge field propagator in calculating the vertex function . to get the parity - odd vertex correction </S>",
    "<S> , we need to consider the diagrams which has odd number of the gauge propagator . </S>",
    "<S> then , the diagram ( a ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is the only diagram that may contribute to the parity - odd part of the vertex function in the next - to - leading order in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> but , one can see that the diagram does not contribute to the magnetic moment of heavy anyon by the coleman - hill argument we used previously . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram ( a ) gives in the large @xmath67 limit    @xmath70 \\left [ ( p - k_1-k_2)^2-m^2\\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> because of the gauge invariance and the analyticity of the effective vertex@xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a function of @xmath74 and regular at zero momenta . in the vertex function ( [ next ] ) , the effecive vertex @xmath75 is contracted with the parity - odd part of the gauge field propagator , @xmath76 of the diagram ( a ) vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find that the next - to - leading order correction in @xmath1 to the magnetic moment of anyon is zero in the heavy anyon limit . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no correction to the chern - simons term in the @xmath0 model @xcite , @xmath77 still holds up to the order of @xmath78 . </S>",

    "<S> this result is consistent with the result claimed in @xcite . </S>",
