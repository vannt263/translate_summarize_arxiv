    "neural collective oscillations have been observed in very many context in brain circuits , ranging from ubiquitous @xmath1 oscillations to @xmath3 rhythm in the hippocampus .",
    "the origin of these oscillations is commonly associated with the balance between excitation and inhibition in the network , while purely excitatory circuits are believed to lead to `` unstructured population bursts '' @xcite .",
    "however , recent ` ex vivo' measurements performed on the rodent neocortex  @xcite and hippocampus  @xcite in the early stage of brain maturation reveal coherent activity patterns , such as _ giant depolarizing potentials_. these collective oscillations emerge despite the fact that the gaba transmitter has essentially an excitatory effect on immature neurons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , also in purely excitatory networks one can expect non trivial dynamics at a macroscopic level .",
    "numerical and theoretical studies of collective motions in networks of simple spiking neurons have been mainly devoted to balanced excitatory - inhibitory configurations , e.g see @xcite and references therein .",
    "only few studies focused on coherent periodic activity in fully coupled excitatory networks of leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons .",
    "these analysis revealed a regime characterized by a _ partial synchronization _ ( ps ) at the population level , while the single neurons perform quasi - periodic motions  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the ps regime is quite robust to perturbations , since it survives to moderate levels of noise or dilution  @xcite .    furthermore , in their recent study bonifazi et al .",
    "@xcite found that the functional connectivity of developing hippocampal networks is characterized by a truncated power - law distribution of the out - degrees with exponent @xmath4 .",
    "this scaling has been shown to hold over one / two decades , thus not ensuring a scale - free distribution for the links over all scales , but surely indicating the presence of a large number of hub neurons , namely cells characterized by a high connectivity . at early developmental stages of the brain , gabaergic hub interneurons ,",
    "performing complex excitatory / shunting inibitory actions  @xcite , seem to be responsible for the orchestration of the coherent activity of hippocampal networks  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of hubs in rendering a neural circuit extremely hyperexcitable has been also demonstrated in simulation studies of a realistic model of the epileptic rat dentate gyrus , even in the absence of a scale - free topology @xcite .    motivated by these studies , but without attempting to reproduce the experimental results , we focus on a very preliminary question : to which extent is the macroscopic neural dynamics influenced by the average degree of connectivity of the neurons ?",
    "our specific aim is to analyze the key ingredients leading to the onset of coherent activity , as opposed to asynchronous dynamics , for different network size and topology .",
    "specifically , we consider the transition from an asynchronous regime to partial synchronization in the excitatory lif pulse coupled neural networks introduced by abbott and van vreeswijk  @xcite . at variance with previous works ,",
    "we consider dynamical evolution on random erds - renyi ( er ) networks with an average connectivity corresponding to that of a truncated power - law distribution with a decay exponent @xmath5 . this amounts to have an average connectivity which scales proportionally to @xmath6 with the number of neurons in the network . in the limit @xmath7 the massively connected network , where the connectivity is proportional to @xmath8 , is recovered ; while for @xmath9 a sparse network , where the average probability to have a link between two neurons vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , is retrieved . the topology of er networks is modified by varying the parameter @xmath1 in the interval @xmath10 $ ] ,",
    "in particular as far as @xmath11 trees and cycles of any order are present in the network , while for @xmath7 complete subgraphs of increasing order appear in the system @xcite . in the paper",
    "we will study how and to which extent these topological modifications influence the macroscopic dynamics of the network , with particular emphasis on the transition from asynchronous to ( partially ) synchronous collective dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to the introduction of the neural model and of the indicators employed to characterize the dynamics of the network .",
    "the phase diagram reporting the collective states emerging in our system is described in sect .",
    "the influence of finite size effects on the coherent activity is analyzed in sect .",

    "whenever the neuron reaches the threshold @xmath17 , a pulse @xmath18 is instantaneously transmitted to all the connected post - synaptic neurons and the membrane potential of neuron @xmath13 is reset to @xmath19 .",
    "the synaptic current can be written as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 representing the synaptic excitatory strength while the field @xmath22 is the linear superposition of the pulses @xmath18 received by neuron @xmath13 in the past , in formula @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of pre - synaptic neurons connected to the neuron @xmath13 ( i.e. the in - degree of neuron @xmath13 ) and @xmath25 the causal @xmath26 function .",

    "our choice for the connectivity matrix has been mainly motivated by the results obtained for `` ex vivo '' cells by bonifazi et al .",
    "in particular , these authors have shown that in developing hippocampal networks the functional connectivity is distributed according to power - law distribution , at least over one / two decades . the distribution of links @xmath48 per neuron is thus given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a normalization constant .",

    "the role of hub neurons in orchestrating the level of synchrony in living brain networks has been clearly demonstrated in @xcite . in spite of these findings",
    "the underlying network topology is maybe less important than the actual number of highly connected neurons , as suggested by morgan and soltesz @xcite .    in order to single out the effect of the average number of connections on the network dynamics we decided to limit our analysis to erds - renyi ( er ) random network  @xcite , but with an average connectivity given by eq .",

    "let us stress that in the present study the distributions of pre - synaptic ( in - degree ) and of post - synaptic ( out - degree ) connections are identical , and this is guaranteed by the above outlined procedure to determine unidirectional links for er networks .",

    "the latter choice can be justified from a physiological point of view by the fact that the synaptic transmission of signals is an _ unreliable _ process @xcite .",

    "on the contrary , in the quenched case once @xmath1 is fixed an unique regime is observable for almost all the investigated sizes . in particular , the network is always in an as for @xmath103 and 1.5 , while it is in the ps regime for @xmath100 and 1.3 for ( almost ) all the considered number of neurons .",
    "these additional findings strengthen the above reported conclusions : finite size systems are weakly chaotic for any considered dynamical regime .    according to the results reported above",
    ", we expect that for sparse networks the maximal lyapunov exponent will eventually saturate to some constant value , apart for possible logarithmic corrections .",
    "thus , sparse networks should remain chaotic for any system size , paralleling the behavior of the microscopic fluctuations shown in the previous section",
    ". therefore microscopic inhomogeneities and chaotic behavior appear as deeply related .",
    "collective periodic oscillations in excitatory er networks can be observed only above a critical average in - degree .",
    "this latter quantity saturates to a constant value for networks with a sufficiently large number of neurons , thus suggesting that the key ingredient responsible for the emergence of collective behaviors is the number of pre - synaptic neurons both for massively connected networks as well as for sparsely connected ones .",
    "this result confirms and generalizes previous findings on the stability of the complete synchronized state for pulse - coupled hindmarsh - rose neurons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that the minimal network size required to observe collective oscillations diverges with the exponent @xmath1 ruling the scaling of the average connectivity with the number of neurons .",
    "the presence of annealed disorder in the network ( corresponding to unreliable synapses ) favors the emergence of coherent activity with respect to the quenched case ( associated with reliable synapses ) , since in the first case the asymptotic average connectivity required to observe collective oscillations is much smaller .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that in the annealed situation each neuron is on average subjected to the same train of stimuli , while with quenched disorder the dynamics of each neuron depends heavily on its neighbors .",
    "furthermore , for sufficiently large networks the macroscopic behavior observable with reliable or unreliable synapses becomes identical .",
    "this seems to indicate that at the level of population dynamics the reliability or unreliability in the synaptic transmission can be irrelevant .",
    "the average in - degree @xmath0 also controls the fluctuations among different neurons , being the fluctuations proportional to the inverse of the square root of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , for er networks with average in - degree proportional to any positive power of @xmath8 , the fluctuations will vanish in the limit @xmath113 , leading to a homogeneous collective behavior analogous to that of fully connected networks .",
    "on the contrary , inhomogeneities among neurons will persist at any system size in sparse networks .",
    "recent experimental results on the intact neuronal network of the barrel cortex of anesthetized rats seems to clearly suggest that the dynamics of this system is chaotic @xcite .",
    "this result poses severe questions about the possibility of reliable neural coding .",
    "the evolution of our models is chaotic for any finite networks .",
    "however , in presence of coherent periodic activity , the chaoticity present in the system is not so strong to destroy the average collective motion",
    ". thus the trial - to - trial variability induced by chaos does not prevent the possibility of the network to encode information .",
    "the information can be coded in some property associated to the global oscillations of the network which are robust to local fluctuations , and this _ collective coding _ can represent an alternative to the dilemma rate versus spike timing coding  @xcite .",
    "the level of chaos in the examined networks decreases with @xmath8 and the dynamics becomes regular in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , the decrease of the maximal lyapunov exponent with @xmath8 slows down dramatically for @xmath9 , suggesting an erratic asymptotic behavior for sparse networks .",
    "our results represent only a first step in the analysis of what matters in the network topology for the emergence of coherent neural dynamics . in future works",
    ", our findings should be critically verified for more complex topologies , like scale - free and small - world , and the influence of other ingredients , like the asymmetry in the in - degree and out - degree distributions @xcite , should be also addressed .",
