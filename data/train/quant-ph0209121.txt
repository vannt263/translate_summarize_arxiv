    "quantum game theory is an interesting new development in the fields of game theory and quantum information .",
    "first initiated by meyer ( 1999 ) , a protocol for two player , two strategy ( @xmath0 ) games was developed by eisert and collaborators ( 1999 ) and extended to multi - player games by benjamin & hayden ( 2001@xmath1 ) . where both players have access to the full set of quantum strategies there is no nash equilibrium ( ne ) amongst pure strategies ( benjamin & hayden 2001@xmath2 ) , though there are an infinite set of equilibria amongst mixed quantum strategies ( eisert & wilkens 2000 ) .",
    "a pure quantum strategy specifies a particular quantum operator to apply contingent on the game situation , whereas a mixed quantum strategy specifies a probabilistic mixture of operators . in a dynamical game one",
    "generally would not expect convergence to a ne . in an entangled quantum game ,",
    "if the ( pure ) strategy of one player is known the other player can produce any desired final state by a suitable ( pure ) counter strategy , assuring them of the maximum payoff .",
    "hence it is always possible for one of the players to improve his / her payoff by a unilateral change in strategy . for a discussion , see the recent review of quantum games by flitney & abbott ( 2002@xmath1 ) .",
    "when one player is restricted to classical moves and the other is permitted the full quantum domain , the quantum player has a clear advantage .",
    "eisert found that in a two player prisoners dilemma the quantum player could guarantee an expected payoff not less than that of mutual cooperation , while the classical player s reward was substantially smaller .",
    "the advantage gained by the quantum player was found to be dependent on the level of entanglement . below a critical level",
    "the quantum player could do no better than adopting the classical dominant strategy .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the relationship between the advantage obtainable by a quantum player over their classical rival and the advantage a quantum algorithm has over a classical one .    in this work",
    "we extend the result of eisert _ et al _ ( 1999 ) and a later generalization by du _",
    "( 2001@xmath3 ) for prisoners dilemma to a general @xmath0 quantum game . section  [ s - games ] will summarize the protocol for @xmath0 entangled , quantum games . in ",
    "[ s - miracle ] we determine the four different miracle moves , depending on the game result most desired by the quantum player , and consider the payoffs as a function of the degree of entanglement . section  [ s - critical ] presents threshold values of the entanglement for various game situations and  [ s - extensions ] briefly considers extensions to larger strategic spaces .",
    "figure  [ f - game22 ] is a protocol for a quantum game between alice and bob .",
    "the players actions are encoded by qubits that are initialized in the @xmath4 state .",
    "an entangling operator @xmath5 is selected which commutes with the direct product of any pair of classical strategies utilized by the players .",
    "alice and bob carry out local manipulations on their qubit by unitary operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , drawn from corresponding strategic spaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 . a projective measurement in the basis @xmath10 is carried out on the final state and the payoffs are determined from the standard payoff matrix .",
    "the final quantum state @xmath11 is calculated by @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the initial state of the qubits .",
    "the quantum game protocol contains the classical variant as a subset since when @xmath6 and @xmath7 are classical operations @xmath14 exactly cancels the effect of @xmath5 . in the quantum game it is only the expectation values of the players payoffs that are important . for alice ( bob )",
    "we can write @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the payoff for alice ( bob ) associated with the game outcome @xmath17 .",
    "the classical pure strategies correspond to the identity operator @xmath18 and the bit flip operator @xmath19 without loss of generality , an entangling operator @xmath20 for an @xmath21-player game with two pure classical strategies ( an @xmath22 game ) may be written ( benjamin & hayden 2001@xmath1 ; du _ et al _ 2001@xmath1 ) would be equivalent , via local unitary operations , and would result only in a rotation of @xmath23 in the complex plane , consequently leading to the same game equilibria . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 , \\ ; \\gamma = \\pi/2 $ ] corresponding to maximum entanglement .",
    "that is , @xmath26 a pure quantum strategy @xmath27 is an su(2 ) operator and may be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "a classical mixed strategy can be simulated in the quantum game protocol by an operator in the set @xmath31 .",
    "such a strategy corresponds to playing @xmath18 with probability @xmath32 and @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 .",
    "where both players use such strategies the game is equivalent to the classical game .",
    "when both players have access to the full set of quantum operators , for any @xmath35 , there exists @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 that is , on the maximally entangled state , any local unitary operation that alice carries out on her qubit is equivalent to a local unitary operation that bob carries out on his ( benjamin & hayden 2001@xmath2 ) .",
    "hence either player can undo his / her opponent s move ( assuming it is known ) by choosing @xmath38 in response to @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , knowing the opponent s move , either player can produce any desired final state .",
    "we are interested in the classical - quantum game where one player , say alice , is restricted to @xmath39\\}$ ] while the other , bob , has access to @xmath40 ; \\ ; \\alpha , \\beta \\in [ -\\pi,\\pi]\\}$ ] .",
    "we shall refer to strategies in @xmath41 as ` classical ' in the sense that the player simply executes his / her two classical moves with fixed probabilities and does not manipulate the phase of their qubit .",
    "however , @xmath42 only gives the same results as a classical mixed strategy when both players employ these strategies . if bob employs a quantum strategy he can exploit the entanglement to his advantage .",
    "in this situation bob has a distinct advantage since only he can produce any desired final state by local operations on his qubit . without knowing alice s move , bob s best plan is to play the ` miracle ' quantum move consisting of assuming that alice has played @xmath43 , the ` average ' move from @xmath41 , undoing this move by @xmath44 and then preparing his desired final state .",
    "the operator @xmath45 has the property @xmath46 so bob can effectively flip alice s qubit as well as adjusting his own .",
    "suppose we have a general @xmath0 game with payoffs @xmath47 where the unprimed values refer to alice s payoffs and the primed to bob s .",

    "although the miracle moves are in some sense best for bob , in that they guarantee a certain minimum payoff against any classical strategy from alice , there is not necessarily any ne amongst pure strategies in the classical - quantum game .",
    "in each of the four cases of equation  ( [ e - payoffs ] ) there can be critical values of the entanglement parameter @xmath58 below which the quantum player no longer has an advantage .",
    "we will consider some examples .",
    "the most interesting games are those that pose some sort of dilemma for the players . a non - technical discussion of various dilemmas in @xmath0 game theory is given in poundstone ( 1992 ) from which we have taken the names of the following games .",
    "the results for prisoners dilemma , using the standard payoffs for that game , were found by eisert _",
    "et al _ ( 1999 ) and , for generalized payoffs , by du _",

    "the situation is more complex for multi - player games .",
    "no longer can a quantum player playing against classical ones engineer any desired final state , even if the opponents moves are known",
    ". however , a player can never be worse by having access to the quantum domain since this includes the classical possibilities as a subset .    in two player games with more than two pure classical strategies the prospects for the quantum player are better .",
    "some entangled , quantum @xmath64 games have been considered in the literature ( iqbal & toor 2001 ; flitney & abbott 2002@xmath2 ) . here",
    "the full set of quantum strategies is su(3 ) and there are nine possible miracle moves ( before considering symmetries ) .",
    "@xmath41 , the strategies that do not manipulate the phase of the player s qutrit ( a qutrit is the three state equivalent of a qubit ) can be written as the product of three rotations , each parameterized by a rotation angle .",
    "since the form is not unique , it is much more difficult to say what constitutes the average move from this set , so the expressions for the miracle moves are open to debate .",
    "also , an entangling operator for a general @xmath64 quantum game has not been given in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum player will still be able to manipulate the result of the game to increase the probability of his / her favoured result .",
