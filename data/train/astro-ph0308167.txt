    "it is a challenge to study the large - scale dynamics of various morphologies of disk galaxies such as bars and lopsided , barred , and normal spiral structures ( e.g. , baldwin , lynden - bell , & sancisi 1980 ; richter & sancisi 1994 ; rix & zaritsky 1995 ) . to include gravitational interactions and magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and magnetic field , we risk in making the task even more formidable",
    "however , multi - wavelength observational diagnostics involving both ism and magnetic field do provide indispensable clues to the overall dynamics .",
    "for example , there have been growing numbers of high - quality observations on large - scale magnetic field structures in nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , sofue et al .",
    "1986 ; kronberg 1994 ; beck et al . 1996",
    "; beck 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "we here venture to formulate a limited yet nontrivial theoretical mhd disk problem in which stationary nonaxisymmetric mhd perturbation configurations are constructed from a background axisymmetric msid of interstellar gas medium embedded with a coplanar azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "we search for both aligned and unaligned stationary configurations in a two - dimensional self - gravitating msid with a flat rotation curve",
    ". our model analysis here will give various stationary morphologies in a magnetized gas disk , including bars and lopsided , barred , and normal spiral structures .",
    "moreover , we provide phase relationships of spatial patterns among magnetic field , gas density , and velocity perturbations that can be examined observationally . regarding the recent wavelet analysis on multi - wavelength data of the spiral galaxy ngc 6946 ( frick et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) that revealed an extension of the interlaced magnetic and optical spiral structures into the outer disk with a largely flat rotation curve , our analysis here conveys an important message that stationary logarithmic spiral patterns of slow mhd density waves ( smdws ; fan & lou 1996 ; lou & fan 1998a ) , with interlaced spiral enhancements of magnetic field and gas density , can indeed persist in an extended msid with a flat rotation curve ( lou & fan 2002 ) .",
    "conceptually , the stationary pattern problem here is closely tied to the density wave problem in a differentially rotating disk ( syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "it is the balance between relevant wave pattern speeds and disk rotation that leads to possible nonaxisymmetric patterns stationary in an inertial frame of reference .",
    "historically , the seminal idea of mhd density waves was contemporary ( lynden - bell 1966 ; roberts & yuan 1970 ) with the early development of density wave theory four decades ago ( lin & shu 1964 , 1966 ; goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; toomre 1969 , 1977 ; lin 1967 , 1987 ; shu 1970a , b ) .",
    "while the stellar disk provides a massivetemplate \" , mhd density wave processes in the ism disk ( fan & lou 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ; lou & fan 1997 , 1998a , b , 2000a , b , 2002 ; lou , han , & fan 1999 ; lyf 2001 ; lyfl 2001 ) do have additional dynamic freedoms .",
    "theoretically , there exist complemetary perspectives , different motivations , and independent approaches to study various bar phenomena in rotating self - gravitating fluid bodies .",
    "the masterpiece of chandrasekhar ( 1969 ) on ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium summarizes the beautiful mathematical descriptions of maclaurin , jacobi , dedekind , riemann ellipsoids and poincar pear - shaped configurations as well as their close interrelations on the basis of instability analyses and characteristics of bifurcations in incompressible self - gravitating fluids .",
    "complementary numerical studies of compressible , self - gravitating , differentially rotating , nonspherical equilibrium figures have shown striking family resemblances to these classical exactly solved problems ( ostriker 1978 ) . by collapsing the dimension along the rotation axis , one can study equilibria and stability properties of two - dimensional riemann disks of uniform rotation relevant to central parts of disk galaxies ( weinberg & tremaine 1983 ; weinberg 1983 ) .",
    "another broad class of disk problems involves stability properties of singular isothermal disks ( sids ) ( zang 1976 ; toomre 1977 ; lemos et al .",
    "1991 ; lynden - bell & lemos 1993 ; goodman & evans 1999 ) .",
    "syer & tremaine ( 1996 ) found solutions to a class of stationary nonaxisymmetric perturbation sid configurations .",
    "shu et al . ( 2000 ) derived solutions for stationary perturbation configurations in isopedically magnetized sids and interpreted them as onsets of bar - type and barred - spiral instabilities ( galli et al .",
    "our analysis here parallels that of shu et al .",

    "shu et al . ( 2000 ) pursued the analogies of bar - type instabilities known in thin self - gravitating disks ( hohl 1971 ; miller et al .",
    "1970 ) as well as in rotating self - gravitating spheroids and ellipsoids of uniform density ( chandrasekhar 1969 ; ostriker 1978 ) for equilibria and instabilities of isopedically magnetized sids . in spite of the known difficulties ( galli et al . 2001 ) , the fascinating scenario of the so - called  fission theory \" by poincar ( 1885 ) , liapunov ( 1905 ) , and jeans ( 1928 ) that regards incompressible ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium as potential candidates for fissioning through pear - shaped equilibria into binary stars has lead shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to speculate that nonaxisymmetric , magnetized , compressible , and perhaps truncated sids might prove to be promising candidates for fragmentation into binary- and multiple - star systems .",
    "they also hypothesized that a rapid loss of magnetic flux at a certain stage might hold the crucial key of resolving or bypassing the relevant known difficulties . in line with these speculations ,",
    "the present msid problem should be relevant to star formation research as well .    based on theoretical analyses ( lau & bertin 1978 ; lin & lau 1979 ; bertin & mark 1979 ) to retain higher - order effects for the wkbj expansion of the poisson equation , bertin et al .",
    "( 1989a , b ) heuristically argued and invoked the cubic dispersion relation of density waves in a thin fluid stellar disk as the conceptual basis for classifying barred and normal spiral galaxies ( viz . , the hubble classification scheme of galaxies ; e.g. , lin & lau 1979 ) constructed numerically by solving the standard linear integro - differential density wave equations with chosen boundary conditions .",
    "important aspects of this modal perspective have been comprehensively summarized in bertin & lin ( 1996 ) . in their scenario ,",
    "bars and barred spirals are essentially viewed as density - wave phenomena that are better described when the effects of long - range self - gravity and differential rotation are more fully included .",
    "specifically , the cubic dispersion relation becomes cubic in the radial wavenumber @xmath13 by including the tangential shear force ( tsf ) for nonaxisymmetric coplanar perturbations ( lyf 2001 ) .",
    "besides the familiar short- and long - wave branches ( both are somewhat modified by the tsf ) , there is now a third wave branch of  open modes \" characterized by even smaller @xmath13 that bear striking resemblances to bars and barred spirals when superposed with an axisymmetric bulge ( see fig .",

    ", it would be natural to pursue the correspondence between the modal perspective of bertin & lin ( 1996 ) and the ( m)sid results here as well as of shu et al .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we formulate in  2 the problems of full and partial msids and display relevant mhd equations .",
    "solutions and analyses for aligned and unaligned msid configurations are presented in  3 . in  4 , we examine the spatial phase relationships between enhancements of gas density , magnetic field , and velocity disturbances . in  5 , we discuss the connection between the modal formalism and the msid perspective for classifying normal and barred spiral galaxies , indicate the implication to multi - band observations of spiral galaxy ngc 6946 , and summarize the results .",
    "mathematical formulae are collected in appendices a@xmath14e for the convenience of reference .",
    "the key difference of our formulation and that of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is that their magnetic field is poloidal threading across the disk and may be effectively relegated into two dimensionless parameters and @xmath15 with @xmath16 const . and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coplanar gravitational acceleration .",

    "in essence , the effect of their poloidal magnetic field can be scaled away such that the analysis is equivalent to a hydrodynamic one , while the coplanar magnetic field of our model can give rise to new classes or features of stationary nonaxisymmetric msid configurations .",
