    "contact interaction has been investigated nonrelativistically in numerous studies using different methods in the context of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation @xcite , and in the context of dirac equation @xcite .",
    "regularization is an approach that is widely used in quantum field theories @xcite.the solution of the schrdinger equation in 1-d for @xmath4-potential needs to be regularized when @xmath5 @xcite even for non - relativistic solution .",
    "the relativistic contact interaction potentials has been investigated in much smaller number of articles , in the context of self - adjoint extensions for pseudodifferential operators by using abstract mathematical approach .",
    "this approach dose not require the use of any regularization method , and the concept of a wave function is not necessary to obtain physical quantities like the scattering amplitude , or bound state @xcite .",
    "however the mathematical language , and the treatment is beyond the grasp of most physicists .    an important feature of most of quantum field theories is locality @xcite . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    ", according to the theory of self - adjoint extensions , the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath6 is local , which means that the wave function to the left and to the right of the contact interaction is a wave function of a free particle .",
    "the boundary condition is characterized by a family of self - adjoint extension parameters . in 1-dimension",
    ", the boundary condition for the wave function at contact point takes the following form @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the parameters subject to the condition @xmath10 , and @xmath11- \\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ ] . therefore , the five parameters @xmath12 reduced to 4-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of the non - relativistic free - particle hamiltonian , which can describe any contact interaction .",
    "for example the @xmath4-function , and after imposing parity symmetry , the boundary condition can be reduced to a 1-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions , which is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the binding energy of the of the particle with mass @xmath16 .",
    "recently , the problem has been investigated by solving directly the relativistic schrdinger equation in 1-dimension for the @xmath0-function potential and the @xmath3-function potential .",
    "the problem require dimensional or cutoff regularization @xcite . the resulting wave function for the bound state",
    "is @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the energy of the bound state .",
    "the resulting wave function for the scattering states is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy of a scattering state , @xmath21 is the renormalized coupling constant , @xmath22 are constants . aside from the contact point @xmath23 , the same result can be obtained for @xmath3-function potential .",
    "it is important to notice here that ; the argument that the wave function to the left and to the right of the origin does not feel the contact interaction , is no longer valid .",
    "that is because of the second term in eq.([psixdeltafirst ] ) , which does not vanish for @xmath24 .",
    "this is one of the reasons that makes eq.([self1d1 ] ) or eq.([self1d2 ] ) invalid for the relativistic case .",
    "that is why we say that pseudodifferential @xmath25 is non - local .",
    "in fact , this is one of the most important results of @xcite .",
    "the treatment also shows that the @xmath0-function potential and @xmath3-function potential shares several non - trivial features with relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "for example , it is asymptotically free @xcite , just like quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the massless limit , it undergoes dimensional transmutation , and it possesses an infrared conformal fixed point . an additional important feature that relativistic mechanics shares with some quantum field theories is universality . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that we can not distinguish physically between the @xmath0-function potential , the @xmath3-function potential , or a combination of them .",
    "this is similar to the situation in local quantum field theories , when all the lagrangians corresponding to different models reduce to one lagrangian once the cutoff is removed .",
    "the evidence of universality for the solution of the relativistic schrdinger equation with a general contact interactions in 1-dimension is not conclusive .",
    "that is because higher derivative than one has never been examined relativistically in this context for the @xmath0-function potential .",
    "the method of choice for regularizing the is cutoff regularization .",
    "it has many advantages , one of the most important is ; it give us a quantitative measure of how big is big and how small is small in terms of the momentum cutoff @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the gap equation for the @xmath0-function potential case is @xmath27 where @xmath28 from eq([lambs2 ] ) and eq([lambs1 ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath29 as @xmath30 . on the other hand eq.([deltawf ] ) gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the normalization constant .",
    "eq.([psism ] ) means that @xmath34 as @xmath30 , while @xmath35 is a finite non zero quantity . in the case of the @xmath3-function potential , @xmath36 is finite while @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "the momentum cutoff is not only envisage how fast functions go to infinity or to zero at certain point , it also reveal the behavior of these functions near a singular point or points .",
    "it is important to remember that , what is right for a very large @xmath26 is right for @xmath39 . in this way",
    ", we can not just avoid dealing with a function at singular points because they are undefined . to highlight this point ,",
    "let us introduce the momentum cutoff to the @xmath0-function .",
    "then we can write @xmath40 it straightforward to find that the extreme value of @xmath41 at the origin is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "a more delegate example is the @xmath3-function . for this case @xmath42",
    "form figure 1 , and as expected from an odd function , it vanishes at origin .",
    "the nearest extrema of the function @xmath43 to the origin are at @xmath44 .",
    "the extreme values are proportional to @xmath26 , and the value of @xmath45 is inversely proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "the previous two examples show that the behavior of a singular function at , or near the origin , can be understood by cutting off the integral interval from @xmath46 to @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the present work is aim to present a general scheme for solving the schrdinger equation with arbitrary derivative of the @xmath0-potential using cutoff regularization .",
    "both of the non - relativistic and relativistic are studied in details .",
    "the @xmath2-potential is presented as an example for this general treatment , it has been shown that universality contact interaction holds for this case too . before removing the cutoff",
    "the it has been proved that there are @xmath48 gap equations for the even function solution , however , after removing the cutoff the number of parameters reduce to only one parameter in both of the non - relativistic and relativistic cases .",
    "in fact this is the correct number of parameters obtained from the non - relativistic theory of self - adjoint extension .",
    "the work has lead to an addition new analogy between relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theories ; it was proved that relativistic case leads to a solution that reduce to the trivial free particle solution once the cutoff is removed .",
    "the non - relativistic @xmath49 -function potential problem solution can be studied using certain procedure of cutoff regularization , this provide an important guidance of how to approach the relativistic case .",
    "the non - relativistic schrdinger equation in this case is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bare coupling constant . in momentum space ,",
    "the above equation is @xmath52 where @xmath53 the second term in eq.([pspacenon1 ] ) can be written as @xmath54 the partial integral can be repeated in the above equation . from the general leibniz rule",
    ", we have @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the binomial coefficient . in addition , is easy to prove that @xmath57 therefore eq.([patialint ] ) can be written as @xmath58    @xmath59    for @xmath60 we get the solution of the delta function that was discussed in details in @xcite . from eq.([generalpsinon ] ) , the bound state wave function in coordinate space is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the binding energy , and @xmath63 the above equations means that the expression of the wave function can be calculated from just calculating @xmath64 .",
    "this can be done using contour integral ( see figure 2 top panel ) .",
    "the result is @xmath65    1.6 cm    as it was explained in @xcite , the non - relativistic problem needs to be regularized , therefore the expression of the wave function in eq.([generalpsinon ] ) is considered as the unregularized expression of the bound state wave function .",
    "the regularization can be done by regularizing the integrals @xmath66 . for cutoff",
    "regularization , the interval of the integral in eq.([iknon ] ) is changed to @xmath47 $ ] , accordingly eq.([iknon ] ) is written as @xmath67 the regularization includes the bare coupling constant as well .",
    "we define @xmath68 . from eq.([iknonreg ] ) , and for arbitrary @xmath69 , the general expression of @xmath70 can be obtained in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "the result is @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is a hypergeometric function with one variable . on the other hand , it straightforward to prove that @xmath74 for @xmath38 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath75 is given by the following relation @xmath76 at this point , the regularized form of the wave function can be introduced .",
    "it can be written as @xmath77 the gap equation can be derived from the above equation . substituting @xmath78 in eq.([regboundwf ] ) leads to one algebraic equation , in addition , deriving eq.([regboundwf ] ) for one time , two times , until @xmath1-times at @xmath78 give additional @xmath1-equations .",
    "the @xmath79-equations are @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is a short hand for @xmath83 .",
    "it is very important to distinguish between two cases ; the first one , when the derivative of the @xmath0-function potential is an even number . in this case",
    "the wave function is either an even or an odd function . for an even wave function solution . @xmath84 therefore using eq.([psizerosys ] ) , the gap equation can be obtained from the roots of the following equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the values of @xmath87 can be calculated in terms of @xmath88 by solving eqs.([psizerosys ] ) , and using one of the @xmath1 roots from eq.([seqeqeven ] ) at a time .",
    "for the odd wave function solution , @xmath89 therefore using eq.([psizerosys ] ) , the gap equation can be obtained from the roots of the following equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the values of @xmath92 can be calculated in terms of @xmath93 by solving eqs.([psizerosys ] ) , and using one of the roots @xmath94 from eq.([seqeqodd ] ) , one root at a time . in total , we have @xmath95 solutions for the even derivative case .",
    "the second case is when the derivative of the @xmath0-function potential is an odd number . in this case",
    "the solution is neither a n odd nor an even function @xmath96 where @xmath97 from eq.([seqeqodd ] ) , it is clear that there are @xmath79 gap equations for the @xmath1-odd case .    to be a physical state , the wave function for",
    "the bound state must be normalizable . from eq.([fnpeq ] ) and eq.([generalpsinon ] ) we get @xmath98 at first glance , it seems that the wave function is not normalizable because @xmath99 however further analysis shows that this is not the case , as quantities like @xmath100 goes to zero fast enough as @xmath39 for all @xmath101 such that the integrals in eq.([normanongen ] ) converges .",
    "this can be very well demonstrated in section 3 .",
    "the scattering wave function for the non - relativistic case can be studied using the following ansatz @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are arbitrary constants that will be defined later . to calculate the scattering states , the expression of @xmath105",
    "must be calculated first .",

    "in contrast , the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic case for ultra - strong bound state gives a repulsive @xmath2-function potential with @xmath293 in eq.([psixdeltafirstnonlim ] ) . at first glance",

    "however , the fact that contact interactions happen at very short distances can explain the issue .",

    "in fact , once the cutoff is removed the value of @xmath321 , and @xmath322 , which means that the resulting scattering states @xmath323 are the ones for a free particle . as a result of the argument in this subsection , the odd wave function solution has a bound state which is normalizable , on the other hand , the particle does not scatter from the potential , instead it acts as the potential does not exist .",
    "a general method has been developed to solve the schrdinger equation relativistically and non - relativistically for an arbitrary derivative of the @xmath0 -function potential in 1-d .",
    "the problem needed to be regularized in both of the two cases .",
    "the method of choices and convenience is cutoff regularization . as we know , when the @xmath1-derivative of the delta function potential is an even number , the bound state solution is either an even or an odd function . on the other hand when @xmath1 is an odd number .",

    "the odd @xmath1-derivative case leads to @xmath79 gap equations . in each equation ,",
    "the bare @xmath51 coupling constant is expressed in term of the integral @xmath75 for the non - relativistic case given be eq.([ikhyper ] ) , or @xmath209 in the relativistic case given be eq.([iebhyper ] ) .",
    "the value of any @xmath324 with @xmath325 can be expressed in terms of @xmath326 using eq.([psizerosys ] ) .",
    "the treatment leads to @xmath327 as @xmath38 , on the other hand @xmath328 always appears in all the formulation as @xmath329 , where @xmath81 .",
    "if the problem is renormailzable , then @xmath330 for @xmath325 , while @xmath331 , and the value of @xmath33 is dictated by the normalization condition . under the same regularization scheme",
    ", the scattering wave function can be derived relativistically and non - relativistically for arbitrary @xmath1 .    as an application for the method",
    ", the @xmath332- function potential has been used as an example . for the even solution case @xmath333 .",
    "it has been shown that there are two possible values for the bare coupling constant @xmath334 given in eq.([gap2der ] ) , and eq.([gaprel2der ] ) .",
    "this example is highlighting the importance of redefining the concept of renormalization from renormalizing @xmath335 to renormalizing the combination @xmath336 , which vanishes as @xmath39 , and renormalizing @xmath337 which is equal to the normalization constant @xmath338 .",
    "for the non - relativistic odd solution case , the problem is proved to be non - renormalizable .",
    "that is because there is an odd - function bound state given by eq.([nonboundodd ] ) , but there is no scattering state because @xmath113 diverges for any value of @xmath109 when the cutoff is removed . for the relativistic odd solution case , there is a normalizable bound state , but it is highly local , which means that it is only nonzero values in the neighborhood of @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , the scattering solution leads only to a trivial free particle solution when the cutoff is removed .",
    "this is analogous to some quantum filed theories , which reduce to a trivial free solution once the cutoff is removed .",
    "another result of this work is in highlighting the fact that the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic case does not lead exactly to the non - relativistic solution .",
    "that is because the non - relativistic case has only an attractive @xmath2-function potential .",
    "in contrast , the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic case , and for ultra - strong bound state gives a repulsive @xmath2-function potential , where @xmath293 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that @xmath2-function potential is a contact interaction that takes place at very short distances , which mean high momentum transfer is taking place .",
    "therefore , even for non - relativistic energies limit , the particle still influenced by powers of @xmath176 higher than two in the expansion of the pseudo - differential operator .",
    "this also explains why the divergence at the origin persist when taking the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic case .",
    "both of the @xmath2-function and @xmath3-function potentials reveal this feature more than the @xmath0-function potential , because in the the @xmath0-function potential there is a repulsive solution for the non - relativistic case .",
    "for the relativistic and non - relativistic @xmath2-function potential even solution , there are 2-parameters family of self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath339 .",
    "when @xmath26 is not large , the wave function for the bound state is an even function , which is differ than the @xmath0-function potential bound state wave function .",
    "the wave function for @xmath340 is different from the the one for @xmath341 .",
    "as the momentum cutoff value increases , the wave function becomes increasingly similar , and the difference between the the two case diminish .",
    "when the cutoff is removed , we get an even wave function with no difference what so ever between @xmath342 and the @xmath343 , as one can see this from figure 3 and figure 5 .",
    "this means that when removing the cutoff , only one parameter left , that is the coupling constant @xmath261 in the non - relativistic case , and @xmath21 energy - dependent relativistic running coupling constant in the relativistic case .",
    "this is similar to the situation in local quantum field theories , when all the lagrangians correspond to different models reduce to a one lagrangian once the cutoff is removed .",
    "then , we left only with certain terms and their associated parameters , while all the other parameters associated with the vanishing term become irrelevant .",
    "it is important to note here that the non - relativistic self - adjoint extension theory predict also that there is only one parameter . after removing the cutoff",
    ", relativistic even solution leads to wave functions for bound and scattering states with the same expression of the analogous ones in the relativistic @xmath0-function and @xmath3-function potentials . as a result",
    ", we have the same interesting features like , asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , and an infra - red conformal fixed point in the massless limit that was discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "moreover , the calculations show that the bound state of the potential @xmath344 has exactly the same expression of wave function for the bound state of the @xmath0-function potential when the cutoff is removed .",
    "also with one parameter survive the cutoff regularization .",
    "it is not clear if the work in @xcite leads to the same conclusion .",
    "the previous results show that the evidence of universality is extended as far as the relativistic @xmath345-function potentials are concerned , where @xmath346 .",
    "that is because in each of these problems , all the parameters are reduced to only one parameter once the cutoff is removed .",
    "in addition the @xmath345-function potentials have the same wave functions after removing the cutoff .",
    "this means that the particle in question is blind to the difference between the @xmath2-function , @xmath347-function , and the @xmath0-function potentials , or a combination of the three of them .",
    "this is highly a non - trivial result because it means that there is an additional feature that relativistic quantum mechanics shares with local quantum field theories , that is universality .",
    "this does not mean that the hamiltonian for the @xmath2-function potential is local , in fact it is nt because of the nonlocal operator @xmath348 .",
    "does universality hold for a more general contact interaction like @xmath349 is still an open question , even after this study . to prove that there is universality to all relativistic contact interactions , we have to prove that the outcome is insensitive to any details of the interaction after removing the cutoff , and the result is always similar to the @xmath0-function potential case .",
    "the non - relativistic @xmath2-function potential hamiltonian is local , and when removing the cutoff , only one parameter remains .",
    "nevertheless , we can not say that there is an evidence of universality , because the the behavior in this case is different than the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential case which has a repulsive solution , while @xmath2-function potential has only attractive solution",
    ".    in our opinion , the most important outcome of this study is demonstrating an exercise in applied mathematics , on how to quantify singularities for certain singular functions in term of the cutoff value , or , in layman s terms , how small is small , and how big is big in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "the best part of this demonstration is in describing the behavior of the scattering wave function in the neighborhood of @xmath78 for the odd case .",
    "this is done by combining analytic and numerical methods in calculating @xmath251 , which is one of the terms in the expression of @xmath323 . in the appendix",
