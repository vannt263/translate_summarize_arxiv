    "entanglement entropy and other related information - theoretic quantities such as mutual information , are by now regarded as valuable tools to study different phenomena in quantum field theories and many body systems @xcite .",
    "these quantities provide a new kind of information that can not be obtained from more standard observables such as two point correlation functions .",
    "namely , both the entanglement entropy and the mutual information , are sensitive probes able to detect non - local signatures of the theory such as topological order which can not be detected by any local observable . concretely , the mutual information @xmath0 between two arbitrary regions @xmath1 and @xmath2 has certain advantages over the entanglement entropy .",
    "first , @xmath0 can be viewed as an entropic correlator between @xmath1 and @xmath2 defined by , _",
    "ab = s_a + s_b - s_a b , [ mutinf ] where @xmath9 is the entanglement entropy of the region @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the entanglement entropy of the two regions . by its definition , @xmath0 is finite and , contrarily to entanglement entropy , is non uv - cutoff dependent .",
    "in addition , the subadditivity property of the entanglement entropy states that when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are disconnected , then , [ ssub ] s_a + s_b s_a b , which inmediatly leads to realize that @xmath12 .",
    "subadditivity is the most important inequality which entanglement entropy satisfies .",
    "a standard approach to compute both the entanglement entropy and the mutual information makes use of the replica trick @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations are notoriously difficult to carry out , even in the case of free field theories .    in the context of the ads",
    "/ cft @xcite-@xcite , however , ryu and takayanagi ( rt ) have recently proposed a remarkably simple formula @xcite-@xcite to obtain the entanglement entropy of an arbitrary region @xmath1 of a @xmath13 dimensional cft which admits a classical gravity dual given by an asymptotically ads@xmath14 spacetime . according to the rt formula",
    ", the entanglement entropy is obtained in terms of the area of a certain minimal surface @xmath15 in the dual higher dimensional gravitational geometry ; as a result , the entanglement entropy @xmath16 in a cft@xmath17 is given by the celebrated area law relation , [ hologee ] s_a = , where @xmath18 is the number of space dimensions of the boundary cft and @xmath19 is the @xmath18-dimensional static minimal surface in ads@xmath14 such that @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 is the @xmath22 dimensional newton constant .",
    "the rt formula provides a simple tool to prove the subadditivity of entanglement entropy from the properties of minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "otherwise it has to be laboriously derived from the positive definiteness of the hilbert space .",
    "here we consider the mutual information between two disconnected regions @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the ground state of an strongly coupled quantum field theory with a gravity dual given by the ads / cft correspondence . using ( [ hologee ] ) in ( [ mutinf ] ) , this quantity reads , [ holomi ] _",
    "ab= , where @xmath23 is the area of the minimal surface related to @xmath24 .",
    "recently , the holographic mutual information ( [ holomi ] ) has been considered in a quite remarkably amount of different settings @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a striking prediction for the holographic mutual information arises when analyzing the behaviour of the minimal surface @xmath25 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown how , for certain distances between the two regions , there are minimal surfaces @xmath26 connecting @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for those regimes ,",
    "the holographic mutual information has a nonzero value proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the gauge theory lying on the boundary of ads@xmath14 .",
    "however , when the separation between the two regions is large enough compared to their sizes , then a disconnected surface @xmath27 with , ( _ a b^dis ) = ( _ a ) + ( _ b ) , is both topologically allowed and minimal . in this case , ( [ hologee ] ) yields @xmath28 and a sharp vanishing of @xmath0 then occurs .",
    "this result is quite surprising from a quantum information point of view since , when the mutual information vanishes , the reduced density matrix @xmath29 factorizes into @xmath30 , implying that the two regions are completely decoupled from each other and thus , all the correlations ( both classical and quantum ) between @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be rigorously zero .",
    "indeed , it seems , at least counterintuitive , that all the correlations should strictly vanish at a critical distance , in a field theory in its large @xmath31 limit .",
    "this behaviour is a general prediction of the rt formula ( [ hologee ] ) which is valid for any two regions of any holographic theory . as a matter of fact ,",
    "both ( [ hologee ] ) and ( [ holomi ] ) come from classical gravity in the bulk and provide the correct results to leading order in the @xmath32 expansion",
    ". when the boundary field theory is a large @xmath31 gauge theory , these terms are of order @xmath33 .",
    "thus , one might expect some corrections coming from quantum mechanical effects in the bulk theory , with the first correction appearing at order @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "these @xmath35 order corrections are small enough not to modify the shape of the surfaces and , as have been argued in @xcite , jointly with the leading classical contributions , they obey the strong subadditivity condition .    in this note it is shown that , at least in the case that has been considered , the mutual information ( [ holomi ] ) between two disjoint regions @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the large separation regime , while undergoing a phase transition at a critical distance , instead of strictly vanishing , decays with a law whose leading contributions are given by the exchange of pairs of the lightest bulk particles between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these bulk particles correspond to operators in the boundary field theory with small scaling dimensions as stated by the standard ads / cft dictionary @xcite-@xcite . in order to achieve this result , first we propose to interpret the mutual information in terms of correlators of surface operators . these can be realized in terms of a probe d3-brane using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "an operator product expansion ( ope ) for the long distance mutual information written in terms of these correlators is then provided .",
    "the expansion is in accordance with a recent proposal given in @xcite where authors provide a long distance ope for the mutual information @xmath0 between disjoint regions inspired by an ope for the mutual information in cft previously discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there , the expected leading contributions come from the exchange of pairs of operators @xmath36 located in @xmath1 and @xmath2 each with an small scaling dimension @xmath37 .",

    "ab~c_^_a^_b ^2~c _ ( ) ^4 + , where @xmath38 is the distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath39 comes from squares of ope coefficients .",
    "thus , when considering a cft theory with a gravity dual , one must deal with a quantum field theory in a fixed background geometry and the long distance expansion for the mutual information reduces to an expression similar to ( [ eq0 ] ) , where now one should consider the exchange of the lightest bulk particles .",
    "the direct computation of the one - loop bulk corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy and rnyi entropies of two wide separated disjoint intervals in a 1 + 1 cft has been explicitly addressed in @xcite . here",
    "we ask if a simpler procedure can be used to learn , at least , some basic properties of the long range expansion of the @xmath0 in higher dimensional theories .",
    "our aim is to provide an ope for the holographic mutual information in ads@xmath40 in terms of correlators of surface operators @xmath41 of the dual @xmath3 sym gauge theory . to this end , in this section , we first present some general properties of @xmath0 for subsystems that are weakly coupled to each other .",
    "we show a result that foreshadows the long distance expansion ( [ eq0 ] ) on very general grounds .",
    "then we review the twist operators and their role in computing the entanglement entropy and the mutual information in quantum field theory through the replica trick method @xcite . based on this , an ope for the long distance mutual information is given .",
    "we also discuss on the strong analogies between the twist operators and the surface operators in gauge theories .      we assume , following @xcite , that the nearly factorized density matrix of two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 separated by a distance @xmath38 much bigger than their characteristic sizes is given by , [ eqa01 ] _ a b = _ 0 + _ 1 + ^2 _ 2 , where @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as a result , at order @xmath46 , the entanglement entropy @xmath11 may be written as , [ eqa01b ] s_a b & = & - tr [ _ a b _ a b ] + & = & - tr [ ( _ 0 + _ 1 + ^2 _ 2 ) ( _ 0 + _ 1 + ^2 _ 2 ) ] + & & - tr ( _ 0_0 ) - tr ( ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) _ 0 ) - ^2 tr ( _ 0 ^ -1 _ 1 ^ 2 ) + & = & s_a + s_b - tr ( ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) _ 0 ) - ^2 tr ( _ 0 ^ -1 _ 1 ^ 2 ) , so",
    ", the mutual information at this order reads as , [ eqa01b2 ] _ ab ~ tr ( ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) _ 0 ) + ^2 tr(_0 ^ -1 _ 1 ^ 2 ) .    thus , it is straightforward to realize that at first order in @xmath47 , the mutual information must vanish since @xmath47 could take either sign while @xmath0 is always non - negative . hence , the first non zero contribution to the mutual information is given by , [ eqa02 ] _ ab~^2",
    "tr(_0 ^ -1 _ 1 ^ 2 ) , which does not depend on @xmath48 .",

    "is poorly understood .",
    "nevertheless , let us briefly discuss on how these higher dimensional @xmath63 $ ] operators exhibit significant analogies with extended operators in gauge theories .",

    "the way the field @xmath81 picks up the phase shift @xmath82 resembles the aharonov - bohm effect .",

    "here we argue that it might result helpful to rephrase these quantities in terms of correlators of twist operators ( eq.([eq06 ] ) ) since , once taken this approach , it is in principle possible , to have an ope of these correlators from which @xmath96 , @xmath97 corrections to eq.([holomi ] ) might be obtained .",
    "let us settle on this claim .",

    "a similar expansion also holds for the twist operator @xmath88 $ ] defined along the boundary of a region @xmath2 with characteristic size @xmath99 located at a distance @xmath38 from the origin , [ eqa05 ] _",
    "n ( 1 + _ j _ j^b(a,_j , l ) ^b_j(l ) ) .",
    "thus , the opes and their coefficients @xmath102 appear as one replaces the regions @xmath1 , @xmath2 by a sum of local cft operators , the conformal dimensions and insertion points of the expansion coefficients @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . ] .",
    "assuming that the vacuum expectation value of a single operator @xmath105 , the connected correlator in eq.([eq06 ] ) can be written as , [ eqa06 ] ~_i , j",
    "j^b ^a_i(0 ) ^b_j(l ) .",
    "however , recalling eqs.([eqa02])-([eqa03 ] ) , one notices that this ope for the mutual information should not be valid , as only involves @xmath106 terms @xmath107 contrarily to the expected @xmath108 ones @xmath109 .",
    "let us fix this point by focusing on the 1 + 1 cft case .",
    "if one performs a sort of ope such as the one given by eq.([eqa06 ] ) on the quantity within the brackets in eq.([eq07 ] ) , then the computation of @xmath0 singles out the term that is linear in @xmath110 .",

    "we first notice that the long distance expansion for the operator @xmath66 $ ] with a chiral primary operator ( cpo ) @xmath114 inserted at @xmath115 is given by , [ eqa07 ] = _ k^a",

    "it results reasonable to propose a long distance ope for the mutual information which jointly takes into account the long distance correlators of each one of the twist fields with all the cpo which one might find inserted on the other region .",

    "it is worth to note that , while little is known about twist fields in higher dimensional cfts , not to say about the coefficients @xmath120 of the ope . as discussed above , those seem to be line or surface - like operators of a sort with analogous properties to the better known line and surface operators of gauge theories .",
    "therefore , it might result tempting to access the properties of the mutual information in higher dimensional theories through the properties of these higher dimensional gauge operators , especially in situations where the benefits of computing through the ads / cft correspondence are manifest .",
