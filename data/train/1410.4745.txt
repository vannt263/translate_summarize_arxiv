    "the inclusive @xmath0 cross section at @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been measured recently by both the atlas  @xcite and cms collaborations  @xcite . all measurements show a systematic tension when compared to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations .",
    "the disagreement was first observed in the 7 tev data , and then it increased at 8 tev , where the tension with the nlo predictions reaches the @xmath3 level .",
    "the small uncertainties quoted for the nlo calculations suggest that higher - order qcd corrections can not change this pattern .",
    "this triggered a lot of interest and a number of models were suggested to explain this excess in terms of new light states , see e.g. refs.@xcite . however , before discussing any hint for new physics , one needs to fully control the uncertainty associated with the standard model prediction .",
    "one issue that arises , is that refs .",
    "@xcite quote the inclusive cross section , obtained by extrapolating the measured fiducial cross section through data driven monte carlo ( mc ) acceptances .",
    "one reason for quoting the inclusive cross - section is that it is independent of the experimental setup , hence it is possible to make statements about whether two measurements by atlas and cms are in agreement , while fiducial cross - sections are different for the two experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the extrapolation from the fiducial to the inclusive phase space relies on a monte carlo simulation , and thus obviously it depends on the generator used .",
    "for instance , a generator that systematically underestimates the fiducial cross - section would lead to an overestimation of the resulting `` measured '' inclusive cross section .",
    "hence , a comparison to theory should be made first in the fiducial region , for which experimental data is available , before extrapolating the result to the fully inclusive phase space .",
    "a possible way to compare the measurements of both experiments avoiding a big extrapolation to the total inclusive phase space would be to extrapolate the atlas fiducial measurement from the cms one , and vice versa .",
    "this extrapolation would still depend on the monte carlo generator used , but it would involve two cross sections that are typically of the same order of magnitude .    in this note",
    "we compare the measured fiducial cross sections to the nlo predictions and find that there is no sizable tension between the two ( at the 1-@xmath4 level ) .",
    "we then study the effect of the extrapolation from the fiducial region to the inclusive one .",
    "we find that the monte carlo acceptance computed with powheg overestimates the reduction due to the fiducial phase space cuts , leading to a larger total cross section when the extrapolation from the fiducial to the inclusive phase space is carried out .",
    "we study the source of the reduction in the monte carlo prediction , and discuss the possible impact of higher - order corrections . at the moment , only atlas published the measured fiducial cross sections at 7 and 8 tev . since the larger disagreement is observed in the 8 tev data , we focus on the latter measurement for the three leptonic channels , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we present here theory predictions for the fiducial cross section as defined by the atlas experiment at a centre - of - mass energy of 8 tev  @xcite .",
    "the relative fiducial cuts are summarized in table  [ tab : fiducials ] .",
    "our analysis equally applies to the 7 tev case , for which we find similar conclusions .",

    "] we use the mstw2008nlo parton densities  @xcite and central renormalization and factorization scales @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the invariant mass of the leptonic system .",
    "the scale uncertainty is obtained by varying both scales by a factor of two in either direction and keeping @xmath41 . with this setup",
    "we get a total inclusive @xmath0 cross section of @xmath42  pb ( @xmath43  pb ) excluding ( including ) higgs mediation . for consistency , the quoted higgs mediated cross section has also been computed with mcfm . on the other hand , atlas finds @xmath44  pb .    the measured fiducial cross sections at 8 tev are reported in the first column of table  [ tab : fidatlas8vsnlo - mswt - m(ww ) ] , together with the total nlo predictions in the fourth column .",

    ".atlas fiducial cross - sections in fb at 8 tev ( 1st column ) and two processes that contribute to @xmath0 production ( 2nd and 3rd column ) .",
    "the last column contains the sum of the previous two contributions .",
    "the theory predictions are obtained with mcfm with central renormalisation and factorisation scales set to the leptonic system invariant mass , and using the mstw2008nlo pdf set .",

    "despite the substantial tension with the nlo prediction reported by atlas for the inclusive @xmath0 cross section at 8 tev , our findings show that the measured fiducial cross sections are in good agreement ( at about the 1-@xmath4 level ) with the nlo result for all leptonic decay modes .    the discrepancy observed by atlas at 8 tev",
    "can be explained to a large extent by studying the monte carlo predictions used in the extrapolation to the inclusive cross section .",
    "the prediction obtained with the powheg box reduces the nlo result by 9 - 11% . the monte carlo result for the jet - veto efficiency",
    "is found to overestimate sudakov suppression effects with respect to the analytic resummation .",
    "furthermore , at the les houches level , the leptons transverse momentum spectrum is slightly different than the nlo distribution .",
    "this is a higher - order effect , and it leads to a systematic reduction in the fiducial cross section ( of about 3% in the present case ) at the parton - shower level with respect to nlo . as a result , the fiducial cross - section is reduced and the extrapolated ( \" measured  ) inclusive cross section tends to be overestimated .",
    "the latter effect should be taken into account as a potential additional systematic uncertainty associated with the matching procedure of higher - order calculations to a parton shower .    using the nnll+nnlo predictions for drell - yan and higgs production , we provide an estimate for the fiducial cross section , including these higher - order effects .",
    "it suggests that the agreement found at nlo for the fiducial cross sections will remain good , or even improve once nnll+nnlo effects are included in the theory predictions .",
    "a better assessment of higher order effects and related uncertainties is today possible by matching the recently computed nnlo corrections  @xcite to the existing nnll resummation  @xcite .",
    "it would be also useful to encode the nnlo prediction in a fully exclusive nnlo + parton shower generator , on the line of what has been recently done for higgs-  @xcite and drell - yan production  @xcite .",
    "region with their nnlo parton shower approach . ]",
    "further studies are also required for the formally nnlo @xmath48-initiated channel .",
    "at lowest order it amounts to 3 - 4% of the nlo cross section at the inclusive level ( i.e. of the same order of the higgs - mediated reaction ) , but it raises to 8 - 9% after fiducial cuts are taken into account since the jet veto is ineffective when applied to the tree level prediction . due to the large amount of initial state radiation ,",
    "this channel will experience a sizable sudakov suppression , and has a potentially large k factor .",
    "we estimate the nnll+nnlo effects in the jet - veto efficiency , but a more detailed study is necessary .",
