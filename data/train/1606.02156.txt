    "anderson localization , the absence of wave diffusion due to destructive interference between partial waves multiply scattered by a disordered potential @xcite , has been observed in a number of experiments involving atomic matter waves quasi - periodically kicked by laser pulses @xcite or subjected to one - dimensional 1d @xcite and three - dimensional 3d @xcite quenched speckle potentials , as well as ultrasound waves in 3d disordered dielectric media @xcite .",
    "in cold - atom setups , the control of atom - atom interactions ( through , e.g. , feshbach resonances ) together with a weak coupling to the environment constitute precious assets for the observation of interference effects in disorder .",
    "furthermore , atom - optics experiments offer the possibility to directly probe localization phenomena _ inside _ the atomic system , as well as to follow their evolution in the course of time @xcite .",
    "if atoms are injected into a disordered potential with an initial momentum @xmath0 , they no longer have a well defined energy @xmath1 but rather an energy distribution called the spectral function , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral function thus defines a quasi - particle , and generally speaking can provide important physical insights to the complex problem of disorder scattering even without the knowledge of the system s eigenstates @xcite .",
    "even more , it turns out that to achieve a quantitative understanding of cold - atom experiments in speckle potentials and in particular to properly characterize anderson localization , a good knowledge of the spectral function is crucial . indeed , when disorder is strong enough the spectral function is broad , which can have important consequences for the global motion of an atomic cloud .",
    "for instance , a cloud of atoms that are individually diffusive may exhibit a global sub - diffusive behavior as a result of the superposition of the various energy - dependent atomic diffusion coefficients , thus mimicking the onset of localization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if the cloud contains localized atoms , usually a finite part of it remains diffusive and a precise characterization of the spectral function is then required in order to pinpoint the location of the mobility edge @xcite .",
    "related to the spectral function , the density of states ( dos ) in strong speckle potentials is also poorly understood .",
    "this question is however essential as the dos plays a central role in atomic physics , in particular in the discussion of phases of interacting bosons @xcite .    despite its importance",
    ", the calculation of the spectral function of speckle potentials in the strong disorder regime has been little addressed , the main difficulty stemming from the inapplicability of weak - disorder approximations in this regime .",
    "recently however , a systematic semiclassical expansion of the spectral function around the classical solution has been proposed @xcite .",
    "although successful in the large - energy sector , the approach of @xcite fails at capturing the singular quantum corrections at low energies .",
    "as far as the dos is concerned , important progress has been recently accomplished by falco _",
    "@xcite , who used a classical approximation for describing high energies in speckle potentials .",
    "again however , this approach remains inaccurate to capture the low - energy sector . as a matter of fact",
    ", the difficulty of treating low energies in speckle potentials lies in the singular nature of quantum corrections in this region of the spectrum .",
    "such singular corrections are absent for gaussian random potentials @xcite frequently used in condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , they have not been described yet .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the spectral function and the density of states in one ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) speckle potentials , making use of a semiclassical approach based on stationary phase approximations , thereby allowing for a non analytic perturbation expansion in @xmath3 .",

    "speckle potentials are obtained by transmission or reflection of a laser through a rough plate .",
    "the resulting potential @xmath5 felt by atoms subjected to this light is proportional to the square of a complex gaussian field @xcite , with a sign that depends on the laser detuning with respect to the considered two - level transition .",
    "this potential has the following on - site distribution : @xmath12= \\frac{1}{v_0}\\theta \\left [ \\pm v({{{\\boldsymbol{r } } } } ) \\right ] \\text{exp } \\left [ \\mp \\frac{v({{{\\boldsymbol{r}}}})}{v_0 } \\right ] , \\label{eq - distribspeckleonsite}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the heaviside theta function .",

    "another quantity that we will frequently encounter in the following is the two - point correlation function @xmath17 . for the isotropic speckles considered in this paper , the two - point correlation function depends only on @xmath18 .",
    "it decays over a typical distance @xmath19 , referred to as the correlation length @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 defines an important characteristic energy scale , the so - called correlation energy  @xcite : @xmath20 the two - point correlation function can take various forms depending on the experimental setup @xcite .",
    "the approach developed in this paper in principle applies to any shape of the correlation function , but the results for the spectral function and the dos turn out to very weakly depend of it , provided the proper value of @xmath19 is chosen .",
    "consequently , for definiteness we will only consider the gaussian case in the following : @xmath21 as an example , we show in fig .",

    "this field is then multiplied by a proper cut - off function  that physically describes the shape of the plate  which we take gaussian to reproduce the two - point correlation function ( [ eq - specklecorrel ] ) .",
    "finally , ( the opposite of ) the modulus square of the field in coordinate space gives the blue-(red-)detuned speckle potential visible in the observation plane @xcite .",

    "alternatively , a quantum particle with energy@xmath34 encountering a potential barrier of height@xmath34 and thickness@xmath35 will have a vanishingly small probability@xmath36 to tunnel throught it , making the dynamics almost classical .    in the deep semiclassical limit @xmath37",

    "we now would like to describe the quantum corrections to the classical limit in the low - energy region @xmath59 for speckle potentials .",
    "for this purpose , we propose an approach inspired of gutwiller theory @xcite , for which we here sketch the essential ideas .",
    "the starting point is the van vleck form of the propagator , valid in the semiclassical regime @xcite : @xmath60 where the sum runs over classical trajectories leading from @xmath61 to @xmath62 during the time span @xmath63 .",

    "their exact value is not important for the present preliminary discussion , where we remain at a qualitative level and want only to discuss which classical trajectories give the most important contributions . the sum over all classical trajectories is a very complicated one , obviously different for each disorder realization , making the averaging _ a priori _ rather complex .",
    "one can nevertheless envision that the statistical properties of the potential may have a strong influence . for a blue - detuned speckle at low energy",
