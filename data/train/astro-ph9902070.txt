    "the qso j2233 - 606 ( @xmath4  =  2.24 ) has been given tremendous interest as it is located in the middle of the stis hubble deep field south making this field an ideal target for studying the connection between the diffuse gaseous component of the universe and galaxies ( ferguson 1998 ) .",
    "the spectrum of this qso shows several associated systems , ( i.e. systems with  @xmath5  ) , at @xmath3  @xmath6  2.2 with broad c  iv and n  v absorption lines ( sealey et al .",
    "1998 , savaglio 1998 , outram et al . 1998 ) .",
    "hst stis spectra , together with the available ground - based data , provide different pieces of information about these systems over the rest - wavelength range 375 - 2800   .",
    "associated systems have been intensively studied in the past few years because they are believed to be intimately related to the central engines of agns as : ( i ) they frequently show absorption due to high - ionization lines ; ( ii ) they have been convincingly shown to have metallicities of the order of or above solar ( petitjean et al .",
    "1994 , savaglio et al .",
    "1994 , hamann 1997 ) ; ( iii ) the absorbing gas does not cover the background emitting region completely ( petitjean et al .",
    "1994 , hamann et al . 1997b , barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "in a few cases it has been shown that the optical depth of the high - ionization lines varies with time on scales of a year ( hamann et al .",
    "1997b ) as is the case for some broad absorption line systems ( e.g. barlow et al .",
    "this requires a recombination time - scale of less than a year and hence high particle density in the absorbing gas if the observed variability is caused by the change in the ionizing conditions .",
    "soft x - ray spectra of an appreciable fraction of seyfert - i galaxies show k - shell absorption edges of ionized oxygen ( o  vii and o  viii ; reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    ". rapid variability of these absorption edges suggest that the absorbing gas is very close to the central engine .",
    "moreover , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the presence of associated absorption systems and x - ray `` warm absorbers '' in seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the case for a unified model for x - ray and uv absorbers , although attractive , is not completely convincing yet however .",
    "eventhough mathur et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that the x - ray and uv absorptions seen in 3c351 can be reproduced by a single - cloud model , there are cases where two different ionized zones are needed even to produce the optical depth ratios of o  vii and o  viii ( see reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "some seyfert - i galaxies show signatures of the existence of optically thin emitting clouds in the blr .",
    "shield , ferland & peterson ( 1995 ) have shown that the properties of the optically thin clouds in the inner blr are consistent with that of warm absorbers ( see also porquet et al .",
    "analysis of the broad ne  viii@xmath7774 _ emission _ line in qsos shows that the ne  viii - emitting regions have ionization parameters in the range 530 , total hydrogen column densities of the order of 10@xmath8  @xmath9 and average covering factors @xmath1030% for solar abundances and a nominal qso spectrum ( hamann et al . 1997b ) .",
    "the ionization conditions in these emitting clouds are similar to those of warm absorbers .    in order to investigate in more detail the nature of associated systems and their possible connection to warm absorbers , absorptions from species with a wide range of excitation",
    "should be studied .",
    "morevover column densities should be determined taking into account the effect of partial coverage . in this prospect ,",
    "absorption from ne  viii , if present , is crucial as its ionization potential , 207  ev , is much higher than the ionization potential of other easily observable species . to our knowledge the ne  viii@xmath11770,780 absorption doublet has been detected in only two associated systems , in the line of sight to hs1700 + 6416 at @xmath3  =  2.7126 ( petitjean et al .",
    "1996 ; see the hst spectrum in vogel & reimers 1995 ) and in the line of sight to um675 ( hamann et al .",
    "1995 , see the spectrum in hamann et al .",
    "1997a ) at @xmath3  =  2.1340 .",
    "analysis of the latter system leads the authors to conclude that , although the detection of ne  viii provides strong evidence for a link between the associated system and the warm absorber , the total hydrogen column density in the ne  viii phase is too small to produce the warm absorber phenomenon .",
    "recently telfer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have done a similar study ( including detection of ne  viii ) of the broad absorption line system present in qso sbs 1542 + 531 .",
    "note that in all previous studies ne  viii absorption is investigated with low dispersion fos spectra . in the following we discuss in detail the associated systems in the line of sight to qso j2233 - 606 and especially the unambiguous detection of strong ne  viii absorption .",
    "we briefly present the method to derive column densities in case of partial coverage in section  2 ; describe the data in section  3 and the individual absorption systems in section  4 , discuss the physical consequences of the observations in section  5 and draw our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "when an absorbing cloud does not cover the background source completely , the observed residual intensity in the normalized spectrum , @xmath12 , can be written as , @xmath13 where , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the optical depth and covering factor respectively .",
    "the latter is the ratio of the number of photons produced by the region of the background source that is occulted by the absorbing cloud to the total number of photons ( srianand & shankaranarayanan 1999 ) .",
    "if two absorption lines with rest - wavelengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 originate from the same ion ( usually it will be doublets or multiplets ) , their residual intensities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at any velocity @xmath20 with respect to the centroid of the lines are related by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the covering factors calculated for the two lines and , @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the oscillator strengths ( see e.g. petitjean 1999 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is close to 2 for doublets .    though our intuition says that @xmath28 it need not be true in general ( srianand & shankaranarayanan 1999 ) .",
    "indeed due the complex velocity structure in the blr , photons that could be absorbed by lines 1 and 2 ( even in the case of doublets ) originate from spatially distinct regions in the blr .",
    "a cloud can thus be black in line 1 ( covering the blr region emitting at the corresponding wavelength @xmath16 ) , but not in line 2 if it does not cover at the same time the region emitting photons with wavelength @xmath17 . also , the interpretation of the relative covering factors for various ions is not straightforward .",
    "indeed , the covering factor of absorption lines seen over the wavelength range of the qso spectrum that is dominated by the continuum may be larger than the covering factor of lines present on top of the qso emission lines as the extension of the blr is larger than that of the continuum emission region .",

    "we thus do not believe that the possible line at @xmath61875     seen in only one of the spectra can be he  i@xmath7584 .",
    "the emission redshift of qso j2233 - 606 , derived from the high - ionization emission lines c  iv , c  iii ] + al  iii , @xmath4  =  2.237 , is smaller than the redshift derived from mg  ii , @xmath4  =  2.252 , by about 1390  km  s@xmath33 ( sealey et al .",
    "1998 ) . considering the mg  ii redshift as more representative of the intrinsic redshift ( carswell et al . 1991 ) , the associated absorptions , seen over the redshift range 2.1982.2215 , have outflow velocities relative to the quasar of 28005000  km  s@xmath33 which is modest compared to usual associated or bal outflows .",
    "there is a line at this redshift with flat bottom , consitent with line saturation , but with non - zero residual intensity . from the latter",
    ", it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ f222 ] that the minimum covering factor for this line is @xmath34  @xmath6  0.7 .",
    "however before drawing any conclusions it is important to show that the feature is not due to blending of a few weaker lines . in fig .",
    "[ f222 ] we plot the line profiles of the other detected lyman series lines from this system .",
    "it can be seen that the line is very strong .",
    "moreover the residual intensity in the line is _ smaller _ than the residual intensity in the line , consistent with saturation of the line .",
    "we first assume that the covering factor is the same for and . in the middle panel",
    "we plot the observed profile together with the predicted profiles computed from the profile for three values of the covering factor : dotted , short  dashed and long  dashed lines are for covering factors 1 , 0.8 , 0.70 respectively .",
    "the predicted profiles are inconsistent with the observed profile and the latter seems too strong even for the minimum covering factor acceptable for the line ( @xmath34  @xmath6  0.7 ) .",
    "the numerous saturated lines present in this part of the spectrum assures that the error in the zero level determination can not explain the discrepancy .",
    "although we can not reject the presence of weak ly@xmath2 absorption lines superimposed with the absorption , especially in the blue - wing , the good wavelength coincidence between and seems to indicate that the contamination can not be large .",
    "one way to explain the apparent strength of the line is to assume that the covering factor for is _ larger _ than for .",
    "note that this is consitent with the qso emission line to be stronger than the emission line .",
    "if true , then we can expect that the covering factor of the ly@xmath27 line be even larger .    in the top panel we plot the observed wavelength range of the ly@xmath27 line and the predicted profile using the profile for covering factors 1 ( dotted line ) and 0.9 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the best match is obtained for complete coverage though this does not reproduce the ly@xmath27 very well .",
    "smaller values of the covering factor predict too strong a ly@xmath27 line .",
    "we conclude that , in order to understand the residual intensities in the different lyman series absorption lines , it must be assumed that the covering factor increases from to ly@xmath27 .",
    "it is thus likely that the absorbing cloud at @xmath3  =  2.2215 completely covers the continuum source and partially covers the blr .",
    "this system does not show absorption due to any detectable heavy element transitions either in the optical data ( outram et al 1998 ; savaglio , 1998 ) or in the hst data .",
    "if partial coverage is a signature of physical association between the absorbing gas and the agn , then the lack of metal lines in this system could suggest that there are large inhomogeneities in the chemical enrichment of the gas physically associated with central engines of qsos .",
    "however , on the contrary , if we presume that the gas associated with the central regions of the quasar is more or less uniformly enriched , then this system could correspond to very highly ionized gas .",
    "the ionization state should be such that all observable metal transitions are weak and undetectable . this condition demands log h",
    "i / h to be smaller than -8 ( e.g. hamann 1997 ) and log @xmath35(h)@xmath1022 .",
    "note that such a cloud could be related to the warm absorbers .",
    "another possibility is that the gas is extremely metal - poor and is produced by an intervening cloud with sizes less than the blr ( i.e. few pc ) .",
    "not only this is much smaller than the dimensions derived for intervening clouds using adjacent lines of sight ( e.g. petitjean et al . 1998 ) but also these clouds would have been detected by previous surveys far away from the qso .",
    "the , and absorption lines produced by this system are shallow and broad ( @xmath6500  km  s@xmath33 ) like a miniaturised broad absorption line system ( bals ) .",
    "outram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss the and absorptions from this system .",
    "they could not fit the doublet when assuming 100% coverage .",
    "however , they managed to obtain a consistent fit after correcting the continuum by subtracting a gaussian centered at 3938     with fwhm = 670   and maximum depth 19 percent of the original continuum level .",
    "they used a three - component model with large velocity dispersions .",
    "savaglio ( 1998 ) observed the absorption doublet from this system .",
    "she could fit the doublet with six components .",
    "the and ne  viii doublets are detected in the g430 m and e230 m spectra respectively .",
    "note that the doublet is observed at slightly lower resolution than and and the ne  viii doublet is found in a low s / n region blueward the lyman limit of the moderately thick system at = 1.87 .",
    "finally , strong o  v@xmath7629 is seen at @xmath62020     as expected and possibly mg  x@xmath7624 at @xmath72000   .",
    "the stronger line of the , , and ne  viii doublets , together with the line , are plotted on fig .",
    "[ f220 ] on a velocity scale .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines are the predicted velocity profiles computed from the profile of the second transition of the doublets for different values of the covering factor . here",
    "again we assume identical covering factors for both transitions .",
    "it can be seen that in order to reproduce the residual intensities of we need a covering factor of the order of 0.35 at @xmath20  @xmath6  + 150   and 0.50 at @xmath20  @xmath6  100 .",
    "the difference between the two models with @xmath34  =  0.35 and 0.50 , is , at these places , of the order or larger than 0.1 ( 10% of the normalized continuum ; see fig .",
    "[ f220 ] ) when the rms deviation in the spectrum is @xmath60.04 .",
    "the profiles are consistent with a covering factor @xmath36 that can not be reconciled with the values found for .",
    "note that the profiles could be affected by the relatively poor spectral resolution and the derived covering factors should be considered as lower limits .",
    "the maximum error in the covering factor for the lines is about 0.1 , computed from the error in the residual intensity .",
    "the s / n ratio over the doublet is not good enough and consistent residual intensities are obtained for a wide range of covering factors .",
    "the covering factor required for the ne  viii lines is in the range 0.8 - 1.0 with an error per pixel of 0.15 .",
    "the covering factor derived from the ne  viii lines is therefore significantly larger than the one derived from the doublet .",
    "there seems to be an anti  correlation between the covering factor and the ionization state or the wavelength .",
    "this again is consistent with clouds partially covering the blr while covering most of the continuum emission region .",
    "another interesting observation concerns the doubly - ionized species .",
    "it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ transi ] that o  iii@xmath7832 is certainly blended with other lines ; that there may be a shallow absorption at the expected position of c  iii@xmath7977 although most of it should be ly@xmath27 ; and that there is a strong absorption at the expected position of n  iii@xmath7989 .",
    "this line can not be at @xmath3  =  2.093 as there is no corresponding line .",
    "we can not reject the hypothesis that this is an intervening line as the range is of very poor s / n ratio .",
    "interestingly enough , there is an absorption feature at the expected position of n  iii@xmath11684,685 ( see fig .",
    "[ transi2 ] ) .",
    "although such a strong n  iii absorption would be very surprizing ( see next section and fig .",
    "[ models ] ) , the presence of doubly - ionized species can not be ruled out .",
    "the corresponding absorptions from triply ionized species , although weak and noisy , could be present ( see in particular o  iv@xmath7787 and n  iv@xmath7765 ) .",
    "if true , this would imply that the medium has two phases of low and high - ionization ( see next section ) .",
    "since the possible strong n  iii@xmath7989 line goes to zero , suggesting complete coverage ; we note that there is a tendency for the absorption lines redshifted on top of the emission lines ( here and ) to have covering factors smaller than lines redshifted in parts of the spectrum free from emission - lines ( ne  viii and n  iii ) .",
    "this further supports the conclusion that the gas covers the continuum emitting region but only part of the blr .      and",
    "absorptions produced by this system are detected by outram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who already noted the incomplete coverage of the background source .",
    "they conjectured that the absorbing cloud is larger than the continuum emitting region and smaller than the blr .",
    "savaglio ( 1998 ) has noted that single as well as two component fits to the doublet result in a very poor fit , again suggesting partial coverage . and ne",
    "viii doublets are detected in the hst spectra .",
    "the stronger lines of the doublets together with are plotted on fig .",
    "[ f219 ] on a velocity scale .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines are the predicted velocity profiles computed from the second transition of doublets assuming different values of the covering factor ( dotted , short - dashed and long - dashed lines are for @xmath15 = 0.7 , 0.8 and 0.9 respectively ) . here",
    "again we assume identical covering factors for both transitions .",
    "the line of this system is blended with of the system at 2.208 .",
    "we have subtracted the contribution due to the line before doing the analysis .",
    "the covering factor required to fit the doublet is @xmath37 .",
    "however the profiles require values larger than 0.85@xmath38 .",
    "it is quite likely that the ne  viii@xmath7780 is blended with some other line in the blue wing .",
    "also the ne  viii@xmath7770 profile is very noisy and is consistent with a wide range of covering factors .",
    "it is interesting to note that inspite of the poor signal to noise ratio , the profiles clearly suggest that the covering factor is less than 0.7 and we have obtained a consistent fit for @xmath15 = 0.5 .",
    "thus like the = 2.207 system , this system also shows different covering factor for different transitions ; the covering factor beeing lower for than for .",

    "( 1996 ) have also noticed overabundance of nitrogen with respect to carbon and oxygen in the well - studied bal system in q  0226 - 1024 .",
    "they could obtain a much better fit of the lines after taking into account the abundance pattern due to rapid star - formation .",
    "the overabundance of nitrogen with respect to oxygen and/or carbon , does not seem to be seen in every associated system however .",
    "indeed , we have good data for the associated systems in q  0207003 and q  0138381 showing partial coverage .",
    "although solar metallicities are needed to explain the line ratios , there is no indication of enhanced nitrogen abundance .    from the observed",
    "to n  iv column density ratio , it can be seen that log  @xmath52 0.5 ( the ionization parameter @xmath53 is the ratio of the ionizing photons density to the total hydrogen density ) .",
    "however such a value for the ionization parameter implies that the gas producing and n  iv can not account for the observed value of the ne  viii column density without an unrealistically large neon abundance .",
    "another and more likely explanation is that there are two distinct regions with different ionization parameters and that ne  viii predominantly originates from the more highly ionized region .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the ne  viii absorption is spread over a larger velocity range than the and absorptions .",
    "we can check that , even in that case , c  iii@xmath7977 would not be detectable . indeed , the expected c  iii column density is of the order of 10@xmath54  @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ models ] ) , thus @xmath55(c  iii@xmath7977 )  @xmath6  0.2     which is about twice below the detection limit at @xmath7  @xmath6  3100   .    since the low - ionization region by itself can account for the observed h  i and column densities",
    ", the high - ionization region should have @xmath35(ne  viii ) much larger than @xmath35 ( ) which means log  @xmath53 larger than 0.5 and most probably 1 . if we suppose that this component is similar to warm absorbers detected by o  vii and o  viii edges in the x - rays , then the condition that the optical depth of these edges are larger than 0.1 implies log  @xmath35(o  vii )  @xmath10  17.55 and log  @xmath35(o  viii )  @xmath10  18.00 .",
    "photoionization models with solar abundances , fail to produce such high o  vii and o  viii column densities for h  i column densities in the range 10@xmath54 to 10@xmath49  @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , the ratios neviii / ne , ovii / o and oviii / o are all maximized over the range of ionization parameters @xmath53  @xmath6  10100 ( see hamann et al . 1995 ) where log",
    "hi / h  @xmath6  6 . for log  @xmath35(h",
    "i )  =  14 , this corresponds to log  @xmath35(h )  @xmath6  20 and , assuming solar abundances , implies that log  @xmath35(o  vii ) and log  @xmath35(o  viii ) are less than  17 .",
    "thus , it is most likely that in qso j2233 - 606 , the region producing the ne  viii absorption can not be a warm absorber .",
    "it is thus of first importance to study the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of j2233 - 606 especially in the x - rays .",
    "we have studied the associated absorption systems ( @xmath3  @xmath6  @xmath4 ) in qso j2233 - 606 , seen over the redshift range 2.1982.2215 , corresponding to outflow velocities relative to the quasar emission redshift ( @xmath4  =  2.252 from mg  ii ) of 28005000  km  s@xmath33 which is modest compared to usual associated or bal outflows .",
    "we have shown that the ly@xmath2 line at = 2.2215 is saturated but has non - zero residual intensity .",
    "the covering factor of the gas is of the order of 0.7 .",
    "this absorption system is unusual in the sense that there is no detectable metal lines .",
    "this could reveal chemical inhomogeneities in the gas or , and more likely , this absorption could correspond to very highly ionized gas from which no absorption due to heavier element can be detected .",
    "if the latter is true , the ionization factor log  hi / h could be smaller than 8 and the total column density in the cloud larger than log  @xmath35(h )  =  22 . such a cloud",
    "could be related to the warm absorbers . over the redshift range 2.1982.21 , conspicuous ne  viii , o  vi , c  iv and n  v",
    "absorptions are seen whereas the h  i absorption is weak . from analysing these absorptions",
    "we conclude that ( i ) a two - phase medium of low and high - ionization respectively is required to explain the complete set of column densities ; ( ii ) the abundances are close to the solar value but nitrogen is enhanced with respect to carbon ; ( iii ) although difficult to ascertain there is a tendency for the absorption lines redshifted on top of the emission lines to have covering factors smaller than lines redshifted in parts of the spectrum free from emission - lines ; this suggests that the gas covers the continuum emitting region but only part of the blr .",
    "the component at @xmath3  =  2.21 ( + 950  km  s@xmath33 on fig .",
    "[ transi ] ) is remarkable as , though conspicuous in ne  viii and o  vi , it is undetected in h  i , and .",
    "the column densities derived for this subcomponent by voigt - profile fitting are log  @xmath35(ne  viii )  =  14.57@xmath470.10 ; log  @xmath35(o",
    "vi )  =  14.05@xmath470.06 and log  @xmath35(h  i )  @xmath48  13.30 , consistent with what is expected from a high - ionization zone .",
