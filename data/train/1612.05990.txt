    "the recent discovery of the first weyl semimetal in taas has opened a new direction of research in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "weyl semimetals are fascinating because they give rise to weyl fermions as emergent electronic quasiparticles , have an unusual topological classification closely related to the integer quantum hall effect , and host topological fermi arc surface states @xcite .",
    "these properties give rise to many unusual transport phenomena , including negative longitudinal magnetoresistance from the chiral anomaly , an anomalous hall effect , the chiral magnetic effect , non - local transport and novel quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "although many recent works have studied transport properties in taas @xcite , transport experiments are challenging because taas and its isoelectronic cousins have a three - dimensional crystal structure with irrelevant metallic bands and many weyl points . as a result",
    ", there is a need to discover new weyl semimetals better suited for transport and optics experiments and eventual device applications .",
    "recently , the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series has been proposed as a new weyl semimetal @xcite . unlike taas",
    ", mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  has a layered crystal structure and is rather widely available as large , high - quality single crystals .",
    "indeed , mote@xmath2 , wte@xmath2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides are already under intense study as a platform for novel electronics @xcite .",
    "moreover , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  offers the possiblity to realize a tunable weyl semimetal , which may be important for transport measurements and applications .",
    "recently , it was also discovered theoretically that wte@xmath2 hosts a novel type of strongly lorentz - violating weyl fermion , or type ii weyl fermion , long ignored in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "this offers a fascinating opportunity to realize in a crystal an emergent particle forbidden as a fundamental particle in particle physics .",
    "there are , moreover , unique transport signatures associated with strongly lorentz - violating weyl fermions @xcite . for all these reasons , there is considerable interest in demonstrating that mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  is a weyl semimetal .",
    "however , it is important to note that _ ab initio _ calculations predict that the weyl points in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  are above the fermi level @xcite .",
    "this makes it challenging to access the weyl semimetal state with conventional angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated that we can access the unoccupied band structure of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  by pump - probe arpes to the energy range necessary to study the weyl points and fermi arcs @xcite . at the same time , despite the promise of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  for transport , if the weyl points are far from the fermi level , then the novel phenomena associated with the emergent weyl fermions and violation of lorentz invariance will not be relevant to the material s transport properties .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  at doping @xmath3 .",
    "we use pump - probe arpes to study the band structure above the fermi level and we directly observe two kinks in a surface state band . we interpret the kinks as corresponding to the end points of a topological fermi arc surface state .",
    "we apply the bulk - boundary correspondance and argue that since the surface state band structure includes a topological fermi arc , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  is a weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "the end points of the fermi arc also allow us to fix the energy and momentum locations of the weyl points .",
    "we find excellent agreement with our _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "however , crucially , we find that certain weyl points have lower binding energy than expected from calculation and , in fact , are located very close to the fermi level .",
    "this unexpected result suggests that our mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2  samples may be useful to study the unusual transport phenomena of weyl semimetals and , in particular , those particularly exotic phenomena arising from strongly lorentz - violating weyl fermions .",
    "our work also sets the stage for the first tunable weyl semimetal .",
    "our discovery of a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  provides the first weyl semimetal outside the taas family , as well as a weyl semimetal which may be tunable and easily accessible in transport studies .",
    "taken together with calculation , our experimental results further show that we have realized the first weyl semimetal with type ii , or strongly lorentz - violating , emergent weyl fermions .",
    "we first provide a brief background of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  and study the band structure below the fermi level .",
    "wte@xmath2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic bravais lattice , space group @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , lattice constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a @xcite .",
    "crucially , the crystal has no inversion symmetry , a requirement for a weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "the crystals we study are flat , shiny , layered and beautiful , see fig .",
    "the natural cleaving plane is ( 001 ) , with surface and bulk brillouin zones as shown in fig .",
    "we first consider the overall band structure of wte@xmath2 .",
    "there are two bands , one electron and one hole pocket , near the fermi level , both very near the @xmath11 point of the bulk brillouin zone , along the @xmath12 line .",
    "although the bands approach each other and weyl points might be expected to arise where the bands cross , it is now understood that wte@xmath2 is in fact very close to a phase transition between a weyl semimetal phase and a trivial phase , so that the electronic structure of wte@xmath2 is too fragile to make it a compelling candidate for a weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "next , we interpolate between _ ab initio _ wannier function - based tight - binding models for wte@xmath2 and mote@xmath2 to study mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  at arbitrary @xmath13 @xcite . for a wide range of @xmath13 , we find a robust weyl semimetal phase @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]e , f , we show where the weyl points sit in the brillouin zone .",
    "they are all located close to @xmath11 in the @xmath14 momentum plane .",
    "there are two sets of weyl points , @xmath15 at binding energies @xmath16 ev and @xmath17 at @xmath18 ev , all above the fermi level @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the weyl points are almost aligned at the same @xmath20 , although this positioning is not known to be in any way symmetry - protected .",
    "we also note that the weyl cones are all tilted over , corresponding to strongly lorentz - violating or type ii weyl fermions , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]g @xcite .",
    "next , we study a fermi surface of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  at @xmath21 using incident light with photon energy @xmath22 ev , shown in fig .",
    "we observe two pockets , a palmier - shaped pocket closer to the @xmath23 point of the surface brillouin zone and an almond - shaped pocket sitting next to the palmier pocket , further from @xmath23 .",
    "the palmier pocket is a hole pocket , while the almond pocket is an electron pocket @xcite .",
    "we note that we see an excellent agreement between our results and an _ ab initio _ calculation of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  for @xmath24 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]i . at the same time , we point out that the electron pocket of the weyl points is nearly absent in this arpes spectrum , possibly due to low photoemission cross section at the photon energy used @xcite . however , as we will see below , we do observe this electron pocket clearly in our pump - probe arpes measurements , carried out at a slightly different photon energy , @xmath22 ev . based on our calculations and preliminary arpes results",
    ", we expect that the weyl points sit above the fermi level , where the palmier and almond pockets approach each other .",
    "we also present an @xmath25-@xmath26 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig1]j where we see how the plamier and almond pockets nest into each other .",
    "we expect the two pockets to chase each other as they disperse above @xmath19 , giving rise to weyl points , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]k .      next",
    ", we show that pump - probe arpes at probe photon energy @xmath27 ev gives us access to the bulk and surface bands participating in the weyl semimetal state in mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2 , both below and above @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a - c , we present three successive arpes spectra of mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2  at fixed @xmath28 near the predicted position of the weyl points . we observe a beautiful sharp band near @xmath19",
    ", whose sharpness suggests that it s a surface band , and broad continua above and below the fermi level , whose broad character suggests that they are bulk valence and conduction bands . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d - f , we show the same cuts , with guides to the eye to mark the bulk valence and conduction band continua .",
    "we also find that we can track the evolution of the bulk valence and conduction bands clearly in our data with @xmath28 .",
    "specifically , we see that both the bulk valence and conduction bands disperse toward negative binding energies as we sweep @xmath28 closer to @xmath23 . at the same time",
    ", we note that the bulk valence band near @xmath23 is only visible near @xmath29 and drops sharply in photoemission cross - section away from @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]g , h we present a comparison of our arpes data with an _ ab initio _ calculation of mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we also mark the location of the three successive spectra on a fermi surface in fig .",
    "we include as well the approximate locations of the weyl points , as expected from calculation .",
    "we find excellent correspondence between both bulk and surface states .",
    "we add that there is an additional surface state detaching from the bulk conduction band well above the fermi level and that we can also directly observe this additional surface state both in our arpes spectra and in calculation .",
    "our pump - probe arpes results clearly show both the bulk and surface band structure of mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2 , both below and above @xmath19 , and with an excellent correspondence with calculation .",
    "now we show that we observe signatures of a fermi arc in mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2 .",
    "we consider the cut shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , repeated from fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , and we study the surface state .",
    "we observe two kinks in each branch , at @xmath30 ev and @xmath31 ev .",
    "this kink is a smoking - gun signature of a weyl point @xcite .",
    "we claim that each kink corresponds to a weyl point and that the surface state passing through them includes a topological fermi arc .",
    "to show these kinks more clearly , in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , we show a second derivative plot of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c we also present a cartoon of the kink in our data , with the positions of the @xmath15 and @xmath17 weyl points marked .",
    "again , note that although the @xmath15 and @xmath17 are not located strictly at the same @xmath28 , we expect the @xmath28 separation to be on the order of @xmath32 from calculation , so that we can consider them to lie at the same @xmath28 within experimental resolution .",
    "we emphasize that from our pump - probe arpes spectrum , we can directly read off that the energy separation of the weyl points is @xmath33 ev and that the @xmath15 are located at @xmath34 ev .",
    "we also present a quantitative analysis of our data , showing a kink . to do this",
    ", we fit the surface state momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) to a lorentzian distribution and we plot the train of peaks corresponding to the surface state band .",
    "we note that we simultaneously fit the topological surface state , the bulk valence and conduction states and the trivial surface state above the conduction band . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d we plot the resulting band dispersions in white and observe an excellent fit to our spectrum .",
    "next , we define a kink as a failure of the train of lorentzian maxima to fit to a quadratic band . in particular , over a small energy and momentum window , any band should be well - characterized by a quadratic fit , so the failure of such a fit in a narrow energy window implies a kink . after fitting the topological surface state to a quadratic polynomial we find two mismatched regions , marked in fig .",
    "[ fig3]e , demonstrating two kinks . for comparison",
    ", we plot the energy positions of the @xmath15 and @xmath17 as read off directly from fig .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between the qualitative and quantitative analysis , although we note that the fit claims that the @xmath17 kink is lower in energy . to illustrate the success of the lorentzian fit , in figs .",
    "[ fig3]f , g we present two representative mdcs at energies indicated by the green arrows .",
    "we see that the lorentzian distributions provide a good fit and take into account all bands observed in our spectra .",
    "the raw data , the second derivative plots and the lorentzian fitting all show two kinks , providing a strong signature of fermi arcs .    to show that we have observed a topological fermi arc , we compare our experimental observation of two surface state kinks with a numerical calculation of mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , b , we mark the energies of the weyl points as well as the band minimum of the surface state in our arpes spectrum and in calculation .",
    "we see that the energy difference between the weyl points is @xmath35 ev in calculation but @xmath33 ev in experiment .",
    "moreover , the band minimum @xmath36 is at @xmath37 in calculation , but at @xmath38 ev in experiment .",
    "the difference in @xmath36 suggests either that our sample is electron - doped or that the @xmath28 position of the weyl points differs in experiment and theory .",
    "next , crucially , we observe that , in disagreement with calculation , the @xmath15 are located only @xmath39 ev above @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests that the weyl points and fermi arcs in our mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2  samples may be accessible in transport .",
    "this result is particularly relevent because mote@xmath2 , wte@xmath2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides are already under study as platforms for novel electronics @xcite .",
    "since the weyl points of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  may be at the fermi level , it is possible that transport measurements may detect a signature of the strongly lorentz - violating weyl fermions or other unusual transport phenomena associated with weyl semimetals in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "we summarize our results in fig .",
    "we directly observe , above the fermi level , a surface state with two kinks ( shown in red ) . by comparing our results with _ ab initio _ calculation",
    ", we confirm that the kinks correspond to weyl points .",
    "furthermore , the excellent agreement of our experimental results with calculation shows that we have realized the first type ii weyl semimetal .",
    "so far we have studied the surface states of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  and we have argued that mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  is a weyl semimetal because we observe a topological fermi arc surface state . however , topological fermi arcs can not strictly distinguish between bulk weyl cones that are of type i or type ii . while the excellent agreement with calculation suggests that mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  is a type ii weyl semimetal",
    ", we might ask if we can directly observe a type ii weyl cone in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  by arpes .",
    "this corresponds to observing the two branches of the bulk weyl cone , as indicated by the purple dotted circles in fig .",
    "we reiterate that one crucial obstacle in observing a type ii weyl cone is that all the recent calculations on wte@xmath2 , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  and mote@xmath2 predict that all weyl points are above the fermi level @xcite . as we have seen , using pump - probe arpes , we are able to measure the unoccupied band structure and show a fermi arc . however ,",
    "in our pump - probe arpes measurements , we find that the photoemission cross - section of the bulk bands is too weak near the weyl points . at the same time",
    ", our calculations suggest that for a reasonable quasiparticle lifetime and spectral linewidth , the broadening of bands will make it difficult to resolve the two branches of the weyl cone .",
    "we conclude that it is challenging to directly access the type ii weyl cones in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "one obvious concern with our experimental result is that we observe two kinks in the surface state , but we expect a disjoint segment based on topological theory . in particular , all calculations show that all weyl points in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  have chiral charge @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however , our observation of a kink suggests that there are two fermi arcs connecting to the same weyl point , which requires a chiral charge of @xmath41 . to resolve this contradiction",
    ", we study the calculation of the surface state near the weyl points , shown in fig .",
    "we observe , as expected , a fermi arc ( red arrow ) connecting the weyl points .",
    "however , at the same time , we see that trivial surface states ( yellow arrows ) from above and below the band crossing merge with the bulk bands in the vicinity of the weyl points . as a result",
    ", there is no disjoint arc but rather a large , broadband surface state with a ripple arising from the weyl points .",
    "we can imagine that this broadband surface state exists even in the trivial phase .",
    "then , when the bulk bands cross and give rise to weyl points , a fermi arc is pulled out from this broadband surface state . at the same time , the remainder of the broadband surface state survives as a trivial surface state . in this way , the fermi arc is not disjoint but shows up as a ripple . we observe precisely this ripple in our arpes spectra of mo@xmath4w@xmath5te@xmath2 .    as a further check of our analysis",
    ", we perform a lorentzian fit of an arpes spectrum at @xmath28 shifted away from the weyl points , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d , the same cut as fig .",
    "we show the lorentzian fit in fig .",
    "[ fig4]e and a quadratic fit to the train of peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig2]f . in sharp contrast to the result for @xmath42",
    ", there is no ripple in the spectrum and the quadratic provides an excellent fit .",
    "this result is again consistent with our expectation that we should observe a ripple only at @xmath28 near the weyl points .",
    "our results also set the stage for the realization of the first tunable weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "as we vary the composition , we expect to tune the relative separation of the weyl points and @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]h - k , we present a series of calculations of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we see that the separation of the weyl points increases with @xmath13 and that the @xmath15 approach @xmath19 for larger @xmath13 .",
    "we propose that a systematic composition dependence can demonstrate the first tunable weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "we have demonstrated a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  by directly observing kinks and a fermi arc in the surface state band structure . taken together with calculation ,",
    "our experimental data show that we have realized the first type ii weyl semimetal , with strongly lorentz - violating weyl fermions .",
    "we point out that in contrast to concurrent works on the weyl semimetal state in mote@xmath2 @xcite , we directly access the unoccupied band structure of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  and directly observe a weyl semimetal with minimal reliance on calculation . in particular , our observation of a surface state kink at a generic point in the surface brillouin zone requires that the system be a weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement with calculation serves as an additional , independent check of our experimental results .",
    "we also reiterate that unlike mote@xmath2 , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  opens the way to the realization of the first tunable weyl semimetal .",
    "lastly , we note that mote@xmath2 is complicated because it is near a critical point for a topological phase transition .",
    "indeed , one recent theoretical work @xcite shows that mote@xmath2 has four weyl points , while another @xcite finds eight weyl points .",
    "indeed , this is similar to the case of wte@xmath2 , which is near the critical point for a transition between eight weyl points and zero weyl points .",
    "by contrast , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  sits well within the eight weyl point phase for most @xmath13 , as confirmed explicity here and in ref .",
    "the stability of the topological phase of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  simplifies the interpretation of our data . by directly demonstrating a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2",
    ", we provide not only the first weyl semimetal beyond the taas family , but the first type ii weyl semimetal , as well as a weyl semimetal which may be tunable and which may be more accessible for transport and optics studies of the fascinating phenomena arising from emergent weyl fermions in a crystal .",
