    "a peak in the contrast is observed at the up / down dw position while a dip is observed at the down / up dw position .",

    "more physical insight is obtained from the effective forces @xmath65 and @xmath66 which are plotted in fig .",
    "a first interesting feature is that @xmath67 cancels out for @xmath68  nm , which thus would be an equilibrium size for the skyrmion in the absence of the domain magnetostatic energy .",
    "this equilibrium is the result of a balance between the dw energy cost which is proportional to @xmath43 and tends to decrease the skyrmion diameter and the curvature energy cost due the exchange energy which scales as @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetostatic force @xmath70 is large enough at low diameter to destabilize this balance and the final equilibrium position is obtained for a larger value of @xmath71  nm , where the two forces are equal .",
    "this underlines that the magnetostatic energy plays an important role in the stability and size of the skyrmion at zero external magnetic field .",
    "we also carried out micromagnetic simulations for square nanostructures with larger lateral dimensions .",
    "we observed that for sides larger than 1.2  @xmath72 m , the skyrmion structure is not stable and a stripe domains structure appears  @xcite .",
    "this may explain why we did not observe any skyrmions but stripe domains for larger structures with 1  @xmath72 m sides  @xcite .",
    "the confinement is thus an additional important feature for the skyrmion stability .",
    "is the force due to the exchange and effective anisotropy ( black curve ) , @xmath70 is the force due to the magnetostatic interaction between the domains ( red curve ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it may seem surprising that the domain magnetostastic energy plays such an important role in the skyrmion stability given the very small thickness of the layer .",
    "indeed , magnetostatic effects are expected to favor multidomain states only when the film thickness @xmath26 is of the order or larger than the characteristic length @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the dw surface energy .",
    "this criterion expresses the competition between the cost in the dw energy and the gain in the magnetostatic energy when creating a domain .",
    "the energy @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 so that it is decreased in the presence of dmi .",
    "thus , the criterion @xmath76 can be fulfilled even for very low thickness . in our experiments",
    ", we find that @xmath77 is indeed of the order of the film thickness , @xmath78  nm .",
    "this leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that the higher the dmi , the larger the role played by the magnetostatic interaction in the skyrmion stability .",
    "note that this analysis holds for @xmath79 , i.e @xmath80 where @xmath81 , which is the case in our sample where @xmath82 .    to conclude , we have observed stable magnetic skyrmions at room temperature in ultrathin pt / co / mgo films in the absence of applied external magnetic field . using the high resolution xmcd - peem magnetic microscopy technique , we were able to demonstrate its internal left - handed chiral nel structure , which can be explained by the large dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction measured in this material .",
    "micromagnetic simulations are in agreement with our experimental results and we show that the equilibrium skyrmion structure is the result of a balance between the dw energy modulated by the dmi and the magnetostatic interaction in the patterned structure .",
    "this balance is very sensitive to the different magnetic parameters that are @xmath25 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 and the total magnetic moment .",
    "the lateral confinement also plays an important role since it leads to a modulation of the magnetostatic energy .",
    "hence , the size and stability of magnetic skyrmions can be finely tuned by playing with these different parameters .",
    "this will be a key for the design of future devices based on the manipulation of magnetic skyrmions .",

    "<S> a key feature of such magnetic nano - objects is their chiral and topologically non - trivial spin structure , i.e their magnetisation texture can not be continuously transformed into the uniform magnetic state without causing a singularity  @xcite . for a surface </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , this topological property is characterized by the skyrmion number @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the unit magnetization vector ) . for a single skyrmion , </S>",

    "<S> . the skyrmion chiral property is generally driven  @xcite by an additional anti - symmetric term in the exchange energy , namely the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) , induced by the lack of structural inversion symmetry and the spin orbit coupling ( soc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this additional energy term writes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dmi characteristic vector and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two neighbouring spins . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dmi tends to make the magnetisation rotate around @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> the nm size of the skyrmion combined with the low current density needed to induce its motion  @xcite would lead to devices with unprecedented combination of high storage density , large data transfer rate and low power consumption  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topological ( @xmath10 ) and chiral properties of skyrmions are keys for such devices as they control the current induced skyrmion dynamics  @xcite and the interaction of skyrmions with other spin structures and the nanostructure edges  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> have been observed below room temperature  @xcite and in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite . in epitaxial heavy metal / ferromagnetic ultrathin films  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the dmi arises from the breaking of inversion symmetry at the interfaces combined with the large spin - orbit coupling in the heavy metal  @xcite , leading to skyrmions with a nel - like structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed skyrmions were stable only at low temperature  @xcite which prevents any use for applications . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the ultrathin films were grown by molecular beam epitaxy which is not suitable for industrial production .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the attention has shifted to ultrathin ferromagnetic / heavy metal films deposited by sputtering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this class of materials combines several features which makes their use appealing for the study of skyrmion structures and their applications : i/ the magnetic parameters controlling the skyrmion stability and size , i.e the anisotropy , the dmi and the exchange  @xcite , can be easily tuned by playing with the nature and thickness of the materials composing the multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> ii/ they are characterized by a large dmi  @xcite which leads to chiral nel domain walls ( dws )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> iii/ large current induced spin orbit torques are present  @xcite which results in fast current induced dw motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> iv/ the deposition by sputtering is fast and spatially homogeneous and is compatible with standard spintronics devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions , which makes the industrial integration straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> whereas several recent experimental works have studied magnetic bubbles in such materials  @xcite , and demonstrated their current induced motion  @xcite , the direct evidence of their chiral internal structure is still lacking . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the observation of stable chiral skyrmions in sputtered ultrathin pt / co(1  nm)/mgo nanostructures at room temperature and zero applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we used photoemission electron microscopy combined with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd - peem ) to demonstrate their chiral nel internal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the xmcd - peem combines several advantages for the observation of magnetic nanostructures , such as skyrmions : firstly , a high lateral spatial resolution ( down to 25  nm ) ; secondly , the magnetic contrast is proportional to the projection of the local magnetisation along the x - ray beam direction . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the x - ray beam impinges at a grazing angle of 16 degrees on the sample surface plane so that the contrast is approximately three times larger for the in - plane component of the magnetisation than for the out - of - plane one . </S>",
    "<S> this important feature allows the direct imaging of the internal in - plane spin structure of dws or skyrmions . </S>"
