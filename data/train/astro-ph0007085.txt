    "astro - f also known as the infrared imaging surveyor ( iris ) is the second infrared astronomy mission of the japanese institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) .",
    "astro - f is a 70 cm cooled telescope and will be dedicated for infrared sky surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "the astro - f richey - chretian telescope has a 70 cm aperture and is cooled to 6k , and the detectors to 1.8k , using a light weight liquid helium cryostat .",
    "two 2-stage stirling - cycle coolers ensure minimum heat flow from the outer wall of the cryostat , almost doubling the lifetime of the helium thus allowing approximately 150l of liquid helium to sustain the telescope for more than 400 days .",
    "another advantage of using the mechanical coolers is that the near - infrared detectors will still be usable even after the helium expires ( providing the coolers continue to function ) .",
    "astro - f covers wide wavelength range from the k - band to 200@xmath0 m .",
    "two focal - plane instruments are installed .",
    "the first is the far - infrared surveyor ( fis , @xcite ) which will survey the entire sky in the wavelength range from 50 to 200@xmath0 m ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the other focal - plane instrument is the infrared camera ( irc , see table  [ irc ] ) .",
    "it employs large - format detector arrays and will take deep images of selected sky regions in the near and mid infrared range ( @xcite ) .",
    "the irc is a wide - field imaging instrument ( @xcite ) consisting of three independent camera systems .",
    "irc - nir ( 1.8 - 5 @xmath0 m ) , mir - s ( 5 - 12@xmath0 m ) and mir - l ( 10 - 25@xmath0 m ) - see table  [ irc ] ( @xcite ) , capable of simultaneously observing 3 different fields ( 10x10 fov each ) of the sky separated by approximately 20 , with a diffraction - limited spatial resolution of approximately 2 . at the aperture stop of each camera ( i.e. the image position of the telescope primary mirror , @xmath111@xmath212 mm in diameter ) ,",
    "a 6-position filter wheel is placed to select the observing wavelength band .",
    "the filter bands are selected by rotating the filter wheels via commands .",
    "astro - f will have a much higher sensitivity than that of the iras survey having 50 - 100 times higher sensitivity at 100@xmath0 m and more than 1000 times that at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "table  [ limits1 ] shows the current expected sensitivities for a single pointing ( @xmath3 ) using the narrow band filters on the irc - mir detectors . with the astro - f surveys ,",
    "great progress is expected in the research on evolution of galaxies , formation of stars and planets , dark matter and brown dwarfs .",

    "the mission lifetime is relatively short , limited by the capacity of liquid helium coolant .",
    "the satellites have to avoid radiation from the sun and earth thus the single integration times that are capable are relatively short ( 10mins . for astro - f ) . finally , the actual apertures of the telescopes are relatively small ( 70 cm for astro - f , 85 cm for sirtf ) due to the weight constraints placed on the mission payloads by the cooling cryostats .",
    "these small aperture telescopes will undoubtedly suffer from severe constraints in sensitivity due to source confusion due to faint sources ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    to overcome these constraints ,",
    "the hii / l2 mission has been proposed .",
    "the hii / l2 mission is a next generation mission proposed by the japanese institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) tentatively scheduled for launch in 2010 from the new h - iia launch vehicle ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hii / l2 would be a _",
    "warm launch  _ cooled telescope , launched at ambient temperature and cooled to 4.5k in space via natural radiation cooling and a cryogenic cooler .",
    "the lack of a large cryostat means that the satellite weight is vastly reduced and significantly larger aperture mirror can be accommodated . in the case of hii",
    "/ l2 a 3.5 m mirror ( or 8 m unfoldable ) .",
    "in addition , the hii / l2 telescope would be put into a _ halo _",
    "orbit around the 2nd sun - earth lagrangian liberation point ( s - e l2 ) . at this distance , the apparent size of the earth",
    "is reduced to @xmath230 , thereby greatly reducing the heat from the earth .",
    "furthermore , the earth , sun and moon are approximately in the same direction enabling easier shielding and longer integration times of larger areas of the sky .    in the mid - infrared region",
    "hii / l2 would envisage having 2 main instruments covering a short wavelength range from 5 - 12@xmath0 and longer wavelengths from 12 - 2@xmath0 with a fov of 6.1x6.1@xmath17 ( see tab .",
    "[ irc ] ) .",
    "the short wavelength detector would consist of a 2x2 array each of 1024x1024 pixels .",

    "the _ bump _ in the ulig counts at faint fluxes is caused by the strong density evolution incorporated into these models .",
    "table  [ limits1 ] shows the current expected sensitivities for a deep 20 pointing ( @xmath3 ) survey using the narrow band filter wavelengths on the astro - f irc - mir detectors for astro - f and a single 1 hour deep pointing on hii / l2 .",

    "would be seen in the short wavelength bands decreasing towards the longer ( 20 - 25@xmath0 m ) wavelength bands where the confusion limit becomes severe . in general",
    "the trend is towards an increasing fraction of starburst galaxies to normal galaxies towards longer wavelengths .",
    "the agn component maintains an almost constant fraction of the total observed sources over the entire 7 - 25@xmath0 m wavelength range .",
    "the fraction of uligs rises from around 10@xmath21 in the shortest waveband to 65@xmath21 in the longest .",
    "the number of uligs predicted remains approximately constant @xmath27000 from 7 - 15@xmath0 m , dropping to @xmath23000 at the longest wavelengths due in part to the relatively lower sensitivity of these bands . in the 7 - 15@xmath0 m bands we are essentially seeing the entire ulig population .",
    "a significant contribution comes from the pah features in the ulig sed at the longer wavelengths . at all wavebands",
    "the contribution from the ulig component peaks at about redshift 1 due to the form of the strong density evolution assumed by the model . also prominent at 20@xmath0 m is the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate absorption line in the starburst and ulig seds , producing a prominent double hump in the ulig number redshift distribution .",
    "this feature is prominent due to the evolution incorporated into the ulig model .",
    "the emission from the 3.3@xmath0 m feature enhances the detectability of the normal galaxy component ( and to a similar extent the starburst component ) out to redshifts of @xmath21 - 2.5 from 7 - 11@xmath0 m respectively ( see fig .  [ graph ] ) .",
    "in fact as much as 60@xmath21 of the normal galaxies may lie at z@xmath221 in the shortest 2 bands . in all bands approximately 50@xmath21",
    "of the starburst galaxies lie at z@xmath221 within which @xmath110 - 20@xmath21 may lie at z@xmath222 .",
    "interestingly , the role of the mid - ir pah features seems rather important enhancing the starburst galaxy population at redshifts of approximately 1 and 2 in the 15 and 20 - 25@xmath0 m bands respectively as the mid - infrared region containing the 6 - 13@xmath0 m _ forest _ of pah features is redshifted into the respective observation windows . for hii / l2 ,",
    "the survey predictions are very different because the nature of the survey is essentially a _",

    "the proportion of ulig sources is relatively low due to the fact that they are most numerous at redshifts of @xmath11.the dominant population at short wavelengths are the normal galaxies ( over 75@xmath21 ) .",
    "a large contribution of the flux at these wavelengths comes from the 3.3@xmath0 m uib feature . at the longest wavelengths the starburst galaxies become the dominant population .",

    "survey predictions have been made assuming evolutionary scenarios including normal , evolving starburst & agn galaxy components and a strongly evolving ulig component ( @xcite ) . for the astro - f survey",
    ", in general the models predict that between 20,000 - 40,000 sources may be detected in the shortest wavebands dropping to @xmath15000 in the longest ( 25@xmath0 m ) band . at the longest mir wavelengths ,",
    "the deep survey would be severely constrained by the source confusion limit rendering the deepest integrations relatively futile .",
    "this will be an important constraint for both the astro - f , sirtf and future relatively small aperture space infrared telescopes .",
    "although sirtf has a slightly larger primary ( 85 cm ) than astro - f , source confusion at longer mid - infrared wavelengths will still be severe . to integrate deeper _ beneath _ the current constraints set by the source confusion ,",
    "telescopes with significantly larger mirrors will be required ( e.g. ngst & hii / l2 mission ) . in the shorter bands it should be possible to detect many sources out to high redshift @xmath24 with more than half of the normal galaxies being at redshift @xmath221 in the 7 & 9@xmath0 m bands . without doubt",
    "the infrared unidentified bands ( uib - pah features ) aid in the detection of galaxies to higher redshifts , with the 3.3@xmath0 m enhancing the detectabilty of normal galaxies out to high redshift and the pah _ forest _ in general enhancing the detectability of all starforming and normal galaxies in the 20@xmath0 m band .",

    "an interesting possibility for hii / l2 would be the inclusion of an almost monochromatic filter to trace the unidentified ir bands in the pah _ forest _ out to high redshift ( or in fact as a direct indicator of redshift ? )    as it is hoped that astro - f and sirtf will complement each other and pave the way for future generations of space telescopes , so it is also enthusiastically hoped that hii / l2 may would play a complementary role to ngst , first and planck .",
