    "although the one - loop correction to the matter - gauge boson vertex in gauge theory has been studied long ago , the full non - perturbative structure of this vertex has remained a challenge for decades , not only in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) but also for simpler cases as quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . a systematic study for spinor qed",
    "was initiated more than three decades ago by ball and chiu @xcite and led to their well - known decomposition of the vertex into transversal and longitudinal parts .",
    "they also calculated the vertex at one - loop in feynman gauge .",
    "later , the same vertex was calculated in yennie - fried gauge @xcite .",
    "the extension of the ball - chiu results to an arbitrary covariant gauge was carried out in @xcite . in three dimensional spinor qed ,",
    "the massive and massless vertex in an arbitrary covariant gauge was obtained in @xcite .",
    "landau and khalatnikov and independently fradkin have derived a series of transformations ( lkft ) for qed that transform the green functions in a specific manner under a variation of the gauge @xcite .",
    "later these transformations were rederived by johnson and zumino by means of functional methods @xcite .",
    "these transformations are non - perturbative and written in coordinate space .",
    "they can not only be used to change from one covariant gauge to another at a fixed loop level , but also to predict higher - loop terms from lower - loop ones . however",
    ", those predicted terms will all be gauge parameter dependent @xcite .",
    "there have been many efforts to construct the three - point vertex in a way that would ensure the lkft law for the massless fermion propagator , see , for example , @xcite .    in this contribution , which is based on our recent paper @xcite , we consider the less explored case of scalar qed . applying the worldline formalism ,",
    "we present an off - shell multiphoton amplitude master formula , as well as a generalization of the lkft to arbitrary @xmath0-space amplitudes .",
    "the worldline formalism is based on feynman s early and well - known representation of the qed s - matrix in terms of first - quantized path integrals @xcite whose potential for improving on the efficiency of calculations in qed was recognized only following the work of strassler in 1992 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "that work in turn was triggered by an effort by bern and kosower @xcite who found a novel and efficient way to compute gauge theory amplitudes representing them as the infinite string tension limit of suitable string amplitudes .",
    "in particular , in this way they obtained a compact generating function for the one - loop ( on - shell ) n - gluon amplitudes , known as the bern - kosower master formula .",
    "the worldline formalism allows one to rederive this master formula in a purely field theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "more recently , two of the present authors have applied the worldline formalism along these lines to recalculate the off - shell three - gluon vertex  @xcite , recuperating the form - factor decomposition originally proposed by ball and chiu  @xcite in a way that not only significantly reduces the amount of algebra , but also allows one to combine the scalar , spinor and gluon loop cases .",
    "the superior efficiency of the method becomes even more conspicuous at the four - gluon level  @xcite .",

    "_   @xcite applied the string - inspired worldline formalism to amplitudes in this theory , albeit only in momentum space . here",
    "we follow a similar approach , only that for our present purposes it will be essential to work in @xmath0-space as well as in momentum space .",
    "we will first derive a master formula for nonlinear compton scattering with an arbitrary number of photons , on - shell and off - shell .",
    "these amplitudes are becoming relevant these days for laser physics , for a review see @xcite .",
    "then , taking advantage of the fact that , in the worldline formalism , changes of the gauge parameter can be implemented by total derivative terms under the path integration , we derive a generalization of the lkft to arbitrary amplitudes in scalar qed .",
    "we discuss the perturbative workings of this transformation , and finally exemplify both the usefulness of the master formula and of the generalized lkft by a recalculation of the one - loop propagator and vertex in an arbitrary covariant gauge .",
