    "the influence of quenched disorder on phase transitions has been studied since long time ago now . in 1974 , harris @xcite established this famous criterion : _ uncorrelated disorder is not relevant , for a second order phase transition , if the specific heat exponent is negative _ ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the criterion was generalized by weinrib and halperin ( wh ) @xcite for any disorder distribution whose correlation function exhibits a power - law tail , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "disorder is shown to be relevant in these cases : d- 2 & < & 0 a d,[whsrc ] + a- 2 & < & 0 a < d,[whlrc ] being @xmath3 the dimension , and @xmath4 the correlation length exponent of the pure system . after josephson hyperscaling ( @xmath5 ) harris criterion is recovered in the short - range correlated ( src ) regime ( [ whsrc ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the long - range correlated ( lrc ) regime extends the criterion to systems satisfying condition ( [ whlrc ] ) , even if @xmath6 .",
    "this generalization explains why critical exponents for the superfluid ( sf ) transition of @xmath7 change when the fluid is confined in very light aerogels @xcite and do not when confined in , for example , porous gold @xcite .",
    "aerogels are fractal for several length scales @xcite , while porous gold has exponentially decaying correlations beyond the size of a typical pore @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , authors @xcite argued that the critical behaviour of sf @xmath7 in aerogels yet poses intriguing questions to be solved .",
    "for instance , light aerogels are fractal for several length scales , up to a certain value @xmath8 that depends on aerogel density . beyond this length ,",
    "the disordered structure becomes homogeneous , entering an uncorrelated regime .",
    "after harris criterion , as the sf correlation length @xmath9 gets larger than @xmath8 , disorder should become irrelevant , because @xmath10 is negative for this system .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated that this crossover should appear at @xmath11 but , although they approached @xmath12 as close as @xmath13 , no crossover to bulk exponents was observed .",
    "a different universality class was evident for the sf transition of @xmath14he , when confined in aerogels .",
    "an explanation to these changes was given using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the three - dimensional xy ( 3dxy ) model , confined in aerogel - like structures @xcite .",
    "the sf transition belongs to the 3dxy universality class , and correlated disorder could be relevant provided that the wh condition ( [ whlrc ] ) at @xmath2 is fulfilled .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that changes occur because of _ hidden _ lrc , inherent to the process of aerogel formation . using simulated aerogels ,",
    "made by diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca ) @xcite , authors showed that different lrc subsets are physically well defined within the whole aerogel structure . specifically , _ gelling clusters _",
    "( to be defined later in this paper ) are shown to be the relevant structures defining the critical behaviour of the 3dxy model in dlca aerogels @xcite .    in this paper , we study the three - dimensional ising model ( 3dis ) , in presence of such aerogel - like structures .",
    "the pure 3dis has a positive specific heat exponent ( @xmath15 ) , so any type of disorder , correlated or not , will be relevant .",
    "if ising spins are collocated in the pores of aerogels , criticality will be affected by lrc as well as by src disorder .",
    "our main purpose is to elucidate which among these effects dominates the critical behaviour of the 3dis model in this case . along this paper , we report the results of extensive mc simulations of the 3dis in the pores of dlca aerogels at fixed porosity @xmath16 , in order to clarify this point .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ ante3dis ] is a brief review about diluted ising systems studied in the past .",
    "section [ model - sim ] is due to explain the model first , then the simulation procedure in detail , with a preamble on self - averaging , in order to validate our procedure ; two methods to obtain accurate values of the critical coupling are presented at the end .",
    "thermal and magnetic effective exponents are presented , and their asymptotic behaviours are discussed in section [ effective ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclu ] is due to present some concluding remarks .",
    "many experimental , theoretical , and computational works have been done to date , in order to study the critical behaviour of the 3dis model in presence of quenched disorder .",
    "most of numerical and theoretical works address the random - diluted 3dis ( rdis ) , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the ising model in presence _ non - correlated _ distributions of impurities@xcite .",
    "appart , concerning disordered lrc structures , ballesteros and parisi @xcite simulated the 3dis , with dislocations represented by lines of impurities generated at random .",
    "correlations for this type of disorder decay with an exponent @xmath17 .",
    "they obtain a correlation length exponent @xmath18 for the impure system , thus confirming the result of wh , that this exponent should be @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also simulated a diluted 3dis , but with spins located _ on _ lrc sites .",
    "these sites were provided by a previous simulation of the pure 3dis model ; taking all sites from the cluster of dominating spin orientation at @xmath12 , these are then occupied by the interacting ising spins to simulate . clusters for this",

    "they obtain an exponent @xmath18 , also in agreement with the wh expression . in both cases ,",
    "lrc disorder is relevant for criticality .",
    "nevertheless , this particular result from wh has proven recently not to be correct at more accurate approximations .",
    "using two - loop expansions , prudnikov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , showed that the exponent @xmath22 depends on both , the internal dimension of the order parameter @xmath23 and the exponent @xmath24 , not the case in wh s conjecture , independent of @xmath23 .",
    "for both systems , prudnikovs prediction yields @xmath25 .",
    "experiments about the critical point of the liquid - vapour ( lv ) transition of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , confined in @xmath28 porous aerogels @xcite , concern directly the problem we are addressing in this paper .",
    "bulk @xmath26 near its lv critical point belongs to the 3dis universality class , and aerogel - like disorder has proven to contain both , lrc and src disordered structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite report , for the order parameter , exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , consistent with that calculated for the pure 3dis by guida and zinn - justin @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the same experiments , the specific heat curves present finite peaks at @xmath12 , characteristic of a negative exponent @xmath32 , definitely different from the corresponding @xmath33 for the pure 3dis .",
    "actually , within error bars , results for @xmath34 are also consistent with the corresponding rdis value @xcite , @xmath35 .",
    "after these experimental results one may take non - correlated , src instead of lrc disorder , within aerogels , to be the relevant one for the critical behaviour of the 3dis in aerogel pores@xcite .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) calculations for the 3dis with weak amounts of disorder show that a new universality class appears , different from that of the pure 3dis @xcite , and consistent with harris criterion .",
    "since d.  p.  landau @xcite , using mc simulations , concluded that the exponents for the 3dis with random impurities differ from those of the pure system , different works stated that exponents depend on the concentration of impurities . until 1990 , when heuer @xcite began to clarify that differences with rg calculations are due to the fact that exponents obtained from simulations were basically effective ones , and not the asymptotic ones .",
    "ballesteros _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using a @xmath36-reweighting method in mc simulations , found the exponents for the rdis universality class to be independent from the concentration of impurities @xmath36 .",
    "this was confirmed for the random bond ising model in @xmath37 by berche _",
    "et al . _",

    "all those calculations motivated further mc and rg studies about the crossover between the effective and really asymptotic critical behaviour @xcite .",
    "definitive evidences of a new universality class were obtained using neutron scattering in the antiferromagnets @xmath38 @xcite and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "for the first system , exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are the results for the second one .",
    "these results clearly differ from bulk exponents , see for instance those calculated by guida and zinn - justin @xcite : @xmath44 .",
    "the critical behaviour of magnetic systems confined in aerogel  like structures , may be subject of competing lrc and src influences .",
    "the 3dxy model in pores of dlca aerogels , for instance , presents new exponents due only to the presence of gelling clusters , which are lrc , while the src components are irrelevant to the transition@xcite .",
    "however , for the ising model under the same kind of confinement , two different effects may be present .",
    "simulations under strictly lrc types of disorder @xcite , give exponents consistent with the result of weinrib and halperin .",
    "on the other hand , experimental results about the critical point of lv transitions in aerogels @xcite point to the relevance of the uncorrelated part of disorder .",
    "the 3dis in the presence of impurities , on a simple cubic lattice with nearest - neighbor interaction , is described by the hamiltonian : = - _ i j _ i _ j s_i s_j , [ hamilton ] where @xmath45 are the spin variables , @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath47 is the coupling . in",

    ", sites are occupied by a uniform random distribution of @xmath53 particles , so their volume fraction is @xmath54 . to simulate the rdis",
    ", this initial distribution of disorder is held through the rest of the mc simulation .    instead , for aeis simulations to take place",
    ", aerogels are generated through the on - lattice dlca algorithm @xcite with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "monomers and clusters diffuse randomly with diffusivity constants @xmath55 which depend on their mass @xmath56 through @xmath57 . the fractal dimension @xmath58 has been taken equal to its value in three dimensions@xcite , @xmath59 .",
    "they stick irreversibly when they come in contact , and then the process follows up until a single cluster is obtained .",
    "this model is known to reproduce well the geometric features of real aerogels @xcite . at a given stage in this dlca process",
    ", the first aggregate to reach opposite sides of the simulation box in any direction is called the gelling cluster ( gc ) .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the correlation function for this gc is algebraic up to a cutoff , which diverges as @xmath60 . in other words , these objects are fractal ( lrc ) . right after the gc is built , many other smaller clusters ( _ islands _ ) continue to diffuse , and finally attach themselves to the gc at _ random _ sites .",
    "the resulting dlca cluster ( gc with islands ) becomes homogeneous at a very small cutoff , in spite of the existence of a physically well defined fractal structure , the gc .",
    "this cutoff increases as the concentration decreases , a feature already observed for real silica aerogels@xcite . at the volume fraction employed in the present work , @xmath61 ,",
    "the cutoff is so small ( a few lattice constants ) that dlca clusters must be considered as non - fractals .",
    "thus , the presence of islands , which represent the src subset within the whole dlca cluster , actually _ hide _ the lrc behaviour of gelling clusters .",
    "it is in this sense that aerogel - like structures must be considered as a mixture of lrc and src disorder distributions .",

    "theoretical predictions based on the weinrib and halperin model @xcite , able to explain changes on the critical behaviour of the 3dxy model in the pores of dlca aerogels@xcite , may also explain the influence of this type of disorder on the 3dis . in this case ,",
    "two competing effects are present : the random src subset of the disorder ( defined in section [ dlcaproc ] ) , which already affects the critical behaviour of the 3dis , and the lrc subset which , after the extended criterion ( [ whlrc ] ) , may be relevant as well .",
    "this is certainly not the case for the 3dxy model , where harris criterion prevents the src subset of impurities ( islands ) to be relevant : only the weak lrc distribution of impurities ( gc ) is relevant@xcite for the 3dxy . for the 3dis",
    ", theory predicts that both , lrc and src subsets may be relevant . which one finally dominates the critical behaviour ?",
    "results presented in this paper suggest that , in the aeis case , the critical behaviour is ruled by the src fixed point . a plausible explanation to these dominating src effect is provided by theoretical works@xcite : for the 3dis",
    ", rg flows converge to a more stable src fixed point , because at @xmath239 the lrc fixed point is less stable ( marginal ) .",
    "however , it has been mentioned before , without a proof@xcite , that amplitudes of disorder may in some cases affect criticality .",
    "added in proof , we have to mention that in preliminary simulations of the 3dis in presence of mixed kinds ( lrc and src ) of disorder@xcite , evidence of a continuous flow from the lrc fixed point to the src one has been observed , when relative strengths are tunned from a pure lrc distribution of defects to a @xmath240 proportion . in the aeis case , we have analized relative amplitudes ( strengths ) of the lrc and the src subsets of disorder , for @xmath241,to determine that up to @xmath242 of defects are due to islands ( src ) , while only @xmath243 are due to the gc ( lrc ) .    to conclude , it has to be stated that the influence of aerogel - like distributions of impurities on the critical behaviour of the 3dis is yet far from being completely understood .",
    "the problem is similar to that of phase transitions in ising systems with non - integer dimension or in fractal structures .",
