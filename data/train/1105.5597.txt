    "systems composed of coupled nanostructures attract much attention as they not only open the path to new applications but also provide new ways of controlling the states and dynamics of confined carriers .",
    "for instance , systems build of two closely located quantum dots provide the basis for an implementation of excitonic qubits with extended life times @xcite , allow one to effect conditional quantum control of carrier states @xcite , and have been proposed as a source of entangled photons @xcite .",
    "carrier transfer in such double quantum dot ( dqd ) structures can also be used for initializing the spin state of a dopant mn atom in one of the dots @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of the dqd structures are much more complex than those of a single quantum dot ( qd ) , which is manifested in the occupation and coherence dynamics observed in optical experiments @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the richer structure of carrier states @xcite but also to the interplay of a few other factors that govern the evolution of carriers in these systems after an optical excitation : collective spontaneous emission ( radiative recombination of excitons ) @xcite , coupling between the dots @xcite , as well as phonon - induced transitions @xcite and dephasing @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we have investigated the effect of the first two of these factors @xcite and their role in the linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite response of dqds .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that collective effects in the spontaneous emission of uncoupled dqds disappear as soon as the transition energy mismatch between the dots forming the system exceeds the spectral line width of the fundamental transition ( on the order of micro - electron - volts ) , which is well beyond current manufacturing possibilities . however , coupling between the dots leads to pronounced collective effects even for technologically realistic values of the energy mismatch on the order of milli - electron - volts .",
    "we have also pointed out that phonon - related effects can affect the collective spontaneous emission in these systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of phonon - induced transitions and dephasing on the kinetics of collective radiative recombination in dqds .",
    "the interplay of these two factors has recently been shown to determine the recombination properties of a lateral dqd system with direct to indirect exciton tunneling @xcite . here , we consider a vertically stacked system with realistic values of the parameters and focus on the experimentally observable features in the system dynamics assuming the spatially direct nature of the excitons ( no electric field applied ) .",
    "we study the decay of the exciton occupation in a dqd in the presence of phonons and show that it becomes strongly dependent on temperature due to phonon - induced thermalization of single - exciton occupations and pure dephasing processes . for negative coupling ( characteristic of tunneling )",
    ", this leads to an increase of the exciton lifetime with temperature and to its non - monotonic behavior in a typical situation when thermally activated non - radiative decay processes are present at higher temperatures .",
    "we show also that for specific values of the system parameters , coherent transfer of interband polarization between the biexciton and exciton transitions can take place , which is reflected in the non - linear optical spectroscopy of these systems , and we study the stability of this process against phonon - induced decoherence .",

    "one recovers the perfect superradiance ( doubled decay rate ) and subradiance ( no radiative decay ) of the two states .",
    "the former is a precursor of the true superradiance of many identical atomic systems @xcite .",
    "note that this limit can be reached both for identical dots @xmath94 and for strongly coupled ones @xmath95 , which makes it important also in the case of typically strongly inhomogeneous qd systems .",
    "the second effect is related to the oscillating term in eq .  .",
    "in a general case , it can be expected to have little impact on the secular evolution since the two frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 are typically different .",
    "however , the biexciton shift depends on the static dipole moment in the dots , hence on the spatial arrangement of the carriers , and can be tuned e.g. by applying an external axial electric field .",
    "therefore , these two frequencies can be tuned to resonance and this term becomes non - negligible .",
    "physically , this means that the transition from the biexciton state to one of the single exciton state has the same energy as the transition from the same single exciton state to the vacuum state . as follows from eq .  , in such case the exciton coherence @xmath98 is driven by the biexciton coherence @xmath99 , hence coherence can be transferred from the biexciton transition to the exciton transition . in sec .",

    "the initial state of the dqd is chosen to be @xmath173 .",
    "in all the three cases , the biexciton polarization ( green dashed line ) decays exactly in the same way ( with the rate @xmath174 in this case ) .",
    "however , at resonance , its decay is accompanied by the appearance of a relatively long - living exciton polarization ( blue dotted line ) . hence , the decay time of the total coherence ( red solid line ) is considerably extended .",
    "this effect is present only in a narrow energy range around the resonance .",
    "already for a detuning of 0.01  mev , the transfer of coherence to the single - exciton polarization is much smaller and the decay of the total polarization is only modulated by small oscillations .",

    "the only effect is the fast initial dephasing of the coherence @xcite which increases with temperature . in figs .",
    "[ fig : transfer - ph](d - f ) , we present the evolution of a dqd system with coupled dots ( @xmath129 , which corresponds to @xmath175  mev and @xmath176  mev ) . here",
    "we see that the lifetime of the polarization is shortened to some extent already at @xmath156 and becomes very short at @xmath177  k. the amplitude of the single - exciton polarization induced by the polarization transfer also decreases with temperature .",
    "the effect of pure dephasing is visible also here but it affects the evolution only over a very short period and leads to a small almost instantaneous initial reduction of the polarization . the strong temperature dependence observed at longer times is due to real phonon - induced transitions between the single exciton eigenstates which is allowed in the case of coupled dots and is accompanied by a decay of coherences between the single exciton states involved in these phonon - induced transitions and the other two states ( vacuum and biexciton ) . since our initial state involves only the lower - energy single exciton state the phonon scattering within the single exciton subspace induces the markovian dephasing of the interband coherences with a rate which critically depends on the bose occupation factor at the phonon frequency corresponding to the transition to the higher state , @xmath178 .",
    "the major phonon - induced effect is therefore thermally activated . at higher temperatures",
    "it reduces the lifetime of the polarizations from the usual time scales of radiative recombination to the values typical for phonon - related processes , that is , from almost a nanosecond to several picoseconds .",

    "coherences one usually resorts to nonlinear spectroscopy techniques @xcite .",
    "for instance , the effects of dipole couplings between the dots have been thoroughly studied theoretically for the differential absorption measured in a pump - probe experiment@xcite .",
    "tracing the phonon effects on such spectra on the same level of exactness would require including carrier - phonon coupling in the full model of ref .   which would go far beyond the scope of this paper . here , we only present a simplified model of a particular pump - probe experiment in which the extended life times of the optical coherences are manifested in the absorption spectra in the most clear way .",
    "let us consider a pump - probe experiment in which the spectrally resolved lowest - order response of a single pair of coupled dots to a probe pulse is studied after a strong pump pulse ( beyond the usual second order in the pump amplitude ) .",
    "the two pulses are spectrally broad enough to excite all the relevant exciton and biexciton transitions in an identical way .",
    "the delay time between the pulses is long enough for the occupations of the two single - exciton states to equilibrate but much shorter than the radiative life time .",

    "this choice strongly suppresses the gain line corresponding to the emission from the ground exciton state leaving the biexciton absorption line as the only feature in the relevant spectral range .",
    "we then calculate the probe absorption spectrum as the imaginary part of the fourier transform of the total polarization obtained from the simulations with the initial state corresponding to an instantaneous excitation by the probe from the thermalized state prepared by the pump ( in the linear order in the probe pulse area ) .",
    "the spectra obtained in this way , in the area around the transition energy from the lowest exciton state , are shown in fig .",

    "each plot contains three spectra : one at resonance ( red solid line ) and two detuned by @xmath184  mev .",
    "each off - resonant spectrum contains the absorption line corresponding to the exciton - biexciton transition and a weak feature at the exciton - ground state transition energy .",
    "the essential effect is the narrowing of the absorption line at the resonance , which corresponds to the extended life time of the coherent polarization due to the coherence transfer to single - exciton polarization , as discussed above .",
    "this effect is quite strong at low temperatures but becomes less pronounced when the temperature increases and the line widths become dominated by phonon - related effects .",
    "we have studied theoretically the kinetics of radiative recombination of excitons confined in systems consisting of two coupled quantum dots in the presence of carrier - phonon coupling . in general terms",
    ", this corresponds to spontaneous emission from non - identical coupled emitters undergoing an additional , possibly non - markovian dephasing .",
    "we have shown that coupling to phonons strongly affects the dynamics of spontaneous emission by inducing transitions between the bright and dark states of the double - dot structure as well as by pure dephasing processes at short time scales .",
    "both these phonon - related effects lead to strong temperature dependence of the carrier lifetime .",
    "we have shown that in the case of a binding ground state ( negative coupling , typical e.g. for tunneling ) , the carrier lifetime increases with growing temperature . for certain values of system parameters and in the presence of thermally activated non - radiative exciton decay processes , this can lead to a non - monotonic dependence of the exciton lifetime .",
    "we have also studied the process of resonant coherence transfer between the biexciton and exciton transitions and the effect of phonons on the kinetics of this process .",
    "we have shown that this effect can lead to considerable extension of the life time of coherent interband polarization in the double dot system , which is stable against phonon - induced decoherence in a relatively wide temperature range .",
    "we have presented a simplified model of a spectrally resolved pump - probe experiment which shows that the coherence transfer and the resulting extension of the polarization life time manifests itself by line narrowing in the nonlinear absorption spectrum of the system .",
    "our results show that carrier - phonon interaction can qualitatively modify the optical response of double dot systems .",
    "phonon - related effects turn out to play a much more important role in these systems than they do for individual dots .",
