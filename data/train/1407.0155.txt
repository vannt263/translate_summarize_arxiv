    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are powerful explosions , and are among the highest - redshift point sources observed .",
    "the most common phenomenological interpretation of these cosmological sources is through the so called fireball model @xcite . in this model , part of the energy is carried out ( e.g. , from a collapsed star ) by hadrons at highly - relativistic energies , some of which is dissipated internally and eventually radiated as @xmath8-rays by synchrotron and inverse - compton emission by shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "as the fireball sweeps up ambient material , it energizes the surrounding medium through , e.g. , forward shocks , which are believed to be responsible for the longer - wavelength afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "if the grb jet comprises pev protons , it should produce energetic neutrinos through photon - hadron interactions .",
    "the photons for this process can be supplied by the grb gamma rays during its prompt phase , or during the afterglow phase @xcite .",
    "these would lead to the production of charged pions , which subsequently decay to produce neutrinos . within this picture",
    ", grbs should produce neutrinos with energies of @xmath9 tev ( observed frame ) from the same region in which the grb photons are produced @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos , if present , could be readily detected .",
    "hence , the detectability of tev to pev neutrinos depends on the presence of ( @xmath10 ) pev protons and on the efficiency at which their energy is converted into neutrinos , as compared to how much of the energy is in electrons , which is manifested primarily in the prompt grb photon emission .",
    "the high - energy neutrinos from grbs should be detected by large neutrino telescopes , such as icecube and in the future km3net .",
    "icecube , is a cherenkov detector @xcite with photomultipliers ( pmts ) at depths between 1450 and 2450 meters in the antarctic ice designed specifically to detect neutrinos at tev - pev energies . since may 2011 @xcite",
    ", icecube has been working with a full capacity of 86 strings ( ic86 ) .",
    "since grb neutrino events need to be correlated both in time and in direction with the gamma - rays , they are sought after in small angular and short time windows . in this context",
    ", icecube has recently developed a powerful model - independent analysis tool for neutrinos detection , which is coincident in direction and in time to within 1,000 seconds with grb flares reported by the gamma ray satellites .",
    "icecube reported no detection of any grb - associated neutrino in a data set taken from april 2008 to may 2010 @xcite ; none of the high energy neutrinos reported for the next two years @xcite is grb - associated either , and as far as we know no neutrino event has been associated with any grb to date .",
    "this non - detection is in conflict with earlier models @xcite , all of which predicted the detection of approximately ten grb neutrinos by icecube during this period .",
    "those earlier estimates were largely calibrated based on the fireball hypothesis , and were motivated by the assumption that uhecrs are produced primarily by grbs .",
    "the icecube results thus appear to rule out grbs as the main sources of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "this implies either that grbs do not have the ( @xmath10)pev protons , hypothesized in the fireball model , or that the efficiency of neutrino production from these protons is much lower than had been estimated @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the data from the grb monitor ( gbm ) on board fermi to calibrate the photon ( representing electrons ) energy content of the grb jet .",
    "subsequently , we compare this with the upper limit on proton ( turned pion ) energy content , given the non - detection of grb neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , the first catalog of the large area telescope ( lat ) on board fermi includes 35 grbs with gamma ray emission above 100 gev @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain this high energy emission @xcite including hadronic models @xcite .",
    "the same photon - hadron process that produces the charged pions and subsequently the 100 tev neutrinos , would also generate neutral pions that decay to photons of similar energy .",
    "these high - energy photons have been hypothesized to cascade through pair production processes down to the gev regime , where they can escape the jet and be observed by lat",
    ". within this scenario , we use the observed gev burst fluence to put another upper limit on the energy content of the protons in the jet .",
    "in a relativistic outflow ( fireball ) , the energy carried by the hadrons can be dissipated internally , or through interactions with ambient matter .",
    "thus , a substantial part of the bulk kinetic energy is converted to internal energy , which is then distributed between electrons , protons and the magnetic field .",
    "we denote the ratio between the energy carried by electrons and that of the protons as @xmath11 . if the plasma is in equipartition , @xmath12 , but in our analysis this is not a requirement .",
    "the internally accelerated electrons presumably are responsible for the kev - mev photons observed in the grb , which are emitted through synchrotron or inverse compton processes .",
    "the measured gbm burst fluence is , thus , proportional to the energy carried by electrons .",
    "accelerated protons may interact with these ( @xmath13 mev ) photons to produce pions via the delta resonance ,    @xmath14    the branching ratios for @xmath15 and @xmath16 production in this process are 1/3 and 2/3 , respectively . taking into account higher - energy resonances , this interaction could lead to a higher yield of charged pions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 decays to two photons , which are discussed below in sec .",
    "[ sec : pi0_estimate ] .",
    "the associated proton may interact with the photons to produce secondary pions , which could increase the expected neutrino flux from the grb , but we neglect these here . including them would only tighten the constraints on the hadronic content that we derive below from the non - detection of neutrinos .",
    "the charged pion decays to produce @xmath17 and @xmath18 neutrinos and anti - neutrinos :    @xmath19    the energy in this decay is split about evenly between the products , i.e. 3/4 of the @xmath15 energy goes to neutrinos .",
    "although icecube can detect neutrinos of all flavors @xcite , it is most sensitive to tracks produced by @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the atmospheric background of @xmath20 is very high , which calls for the exploitation of shower events of @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , within the short time window of an individual grb , icecube is essentially background - free . in other words , a muon track of sufficiently high energy that is associated in direction and in time with a grb",
    "would most surely be a real detection .",
    "this allows icecube to exploit its high effective area for @xmath20 events , without the downside of the @xmath20 background .",
    "allowing for effective neutrino oscillations , which results in an equal flux of the three flavors at the detector , and since in point source searches the detector is about 10 times more sensitive to @xmath20 than to the other flavors , icecube can be expected to detect 1/3 of the neutrinos , and hence 1/4 of the @xmath15 energy in the form of @xmath20 . denoting the fraction of proton energy that goes into pions as @xmath23 ,",
    "the fraction of proton energy that ends up in neutrinos is consequently @xmath24 .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest that @xmath25 .",
    "it has been suggested that if the resulting neutron ( equation  [ eq_pg ] ) remains in the plasma , @xmath23 can be much higher @xcite . however , in this work we leave @xmath23 as a free parameter and attempt to constrain it from the icecube results .",
    "one can now relate the hadron energy content of the grb jet to that of the gamma ray emitting electrons through the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "the grb fluence serves as a proxy of the electron energy in the jet .",
    "the electrons are assumed to follow a power - law energy distribution with a spectral slope of @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 .",
    "noting that the prompt grb energy fluence measured in the mev ( gbm ) band , @xmath28 , is due only to the electron population in a limited energy range @xmath29 , one can write :    @xmath30    assuming the electrons , protons , and thus ( pions and ) neutrinos all adhere to the same slope , and that all their energies range the same number of decades , the @xmath20 energy fluence of a grb , @xmath31 , can be directly related to @xmath28 through :    @xmath32    what is the neutrino spectral slope ?",
    "@xmath1 is motivated by fermi acceleration , as well as by the icecube measured slope for diffuse neutrinos @xcite .",
    "an independent indication of the slope could come from the photon ( grb ) spectra .",
    "however , the relation between the photon and neutrino spectral slopes is not totally clear .",
    "while @xcite assume they are the same , more detailed fireball models use more parameters to relate the two @xcite . since we wish to avoid model - dependent assessments , we limit ourselves to the generic slope of @xmath1 . in section [ slopes ] , we will discuss the scenario of a neutrino power - law that deviates from the canonical 2 slope .    in the limit of @xmath1 , equation  ( [ eq_n_general ] )",
    "provides a simple expression for @xmath31 :    @xmath33    which is conveniently independent of @xmath34 .",
    "the factor of @xmath35 is due to the fact that the gbm band is roughly two decades of photon energy from 0.01  mev to 1  mev , which arises from only one decade of electrons energy ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) , since the energy of photons emitted by both synchrotron and inverse compton scale as @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 in equation ( [ eq_fn ] ) merely represents the total energy in protons . using equation ( [ eq_fn ] ) ,",
    "the neutrino number fluence is :    @xmath39    employing the icecube effective area curves @xmath40 as a function of declination , we can now estimate the number @xmath41 of neutrinos expected to be detected by icecube for each individual grb , and as a function of the single parameter @xmath42 representing the hadronic fraction in the grb jet :    @xmath43    in figure [ effarea ] , we plot the effective area curves of the complete ic86 array for point source detection of @xmath20 ( a. karle , j. feintzeig , private communications ) .",
    "the efficiency of detecting @xmath21 and @xmath22 from a point source is much smaller , and we neglect it here .",
    "the icecube effective area curves for negative declinations ( overhead at the south pole ) continue to rise with neutrino energy . however , given the declining energy spectrum ( equation [ eq_dnde ] ) , the most grb neutrinos are expected in icecube around 30 tev .",

    "they would add to any other electron emission at these energies if present .",
    "recall that 2/3 of pions produced by the photon - hadron interactions ( equation  [ eq_pg ] ) are @xmath16 . for a spectral slope of @xmath1 , and by analogy to equation  ( [ eq_fn ] )",
    ", their ( maximal ) expected contribution to the fluence measured by lat would be :    @xmath46    if the spectral slope @xmath26 deviates from 2 , the more general factor needs to be used here ( c.f . , equations  [ eq_n_general ] ) instead of @xmath35 .",
    "the cascade products would , thus , carry out from the grb most of the energy that was initially in protons .",
    "additional gev photon fluence @xmath47 could arise from the positrons produced in the charged pion decay ( equation [ eq_pi_decay ] ) that takes about 1/4 of the @xmath15 energy , or 1/12 of the total pion energy    @xmath48    finally , the original electrons in the jet may also emit gev photons with fluence @xmath49 .",
    "accounting for all of these potential gev photon emission processes , one can express , most generally , the total lat fluence as :    @xmath50    the hadronic contribution of the detected lat fluence is the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq_flat ] ) , which allows us to write the hadronic fraction of the lat fluence as :    @xmath51    the actual contribution of the hadrons to the gev emission is model dependent .",
