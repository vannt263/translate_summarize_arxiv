    "non - stationary subdivision schemes have proven to be efficient iterative algorithms to construct special classes of curves ranging from polynomials and trigonometric curves to conic sections or spirals .",
    "aim of this paper is to establish the algebraic conditions that fully identify the reproduction properties of a given convergent , univariate , binary , non - stationary subdivision scheme .",
    "following the notation in @xcite , we denote by @xmath0 the finite sequence of real coefficients corresponding to the so called _ k - level mask _ of the non - stationary subdivision scheme and we define by @xmath1 the laurent polynomial whose coefficients are exactly the entries of @xmath2 .",
    "the polynomial in ( [ symbol_def ] ) is commonly known as the _ k - level symbol _ of the non - stationary subdivision scheme .",

    "we see that the subdivision process generates denser and denser sequences of data so that a notion of convergence can be established by taking into account the piecewise linear function @xmath12 that interpolates the data , namely @xmath13 } \\in \\pi_1 , \\qquad    i\\in{\\mathbb{z}},\\quad k\\geq0,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the space of linear polynomials .",
    "if the sequence @xmath15 converges , then we denote its limit by @xmath16 and say that @xmath17 is the _ limit function _ of the subdivision scheme based on the rule ( [ def : suboper ] ) for the data @xmath18 . due to the linearity of the refinement rule , we can equivalently check convergence of the subdivision scheme when applied to the initial data @xmath19 .",
    "if this is convergent with limit @xmath20 , then we have @xmath21 for any initial data sequence @xmath18 .",
    "since most of the properties of a subdivision scheme ( e.g. its convergence , its smoothness or its support size ) do not depend on the choice of the parameter values @xmath22 , these are usually set as @xmath23 we refer to the choice in ( [ def : primal_par ] ) as to the `` standard '' parametrization .",
    "as it will be better clarified later , with respect to the subdivision capability of reproducing specific classes of functions , the standard parametrization is not always the optimal one .",
    "indeed , the choice @xmath24 with @xmath25 suitably set , turns out to be a better selection . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath26 we call this parametrization `` primal '' , while in the case @xmath27 we use the term `` dual '' parametrization , as in @xcite .",
    "for a complete discussion concerning the choice of parametrization in the analysis of polynomial reproduction for stationary subdivision schemes , we refer the reader to the papers @xcite . in passing , we recall the following definition since it lays the foundations of our results in the non - stationary situation .",

    "we also recall that a convergent subdivision scheme that reproduces polynomials of degree @xmath34 has approximation order @xmath38 ( see @xcite for the proof of this result ) .    in this context , the first purpose of this paper is to deal with the extension of the concepts of polynomial generation and polynomial reproduction to the non - stationary setting , leading to the concepts of exponential polynomial generation and exponential polynomial reproduction . in a few words ,",
    "a subdivision scheme is said to possess the property of reproducing exponential polynomials if , for any initial data uniformly sampled from some exponential polynomial function , the scheme yields the same function in the limit .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to show that , as in the stationary case discussed in @xcite , the choice of the correct parametrization is crucial in the non - stationary setting as well .",
    "+ our analysis brings to algebraic conditions , involving a parametrization of general type ( [ def : dual_par ] ) , that the symbols of a convergent , binary , non - stationary subdivision scheme should fulfill in order to reproduce spaces of exponential polynomials .",
    "we remark that , as the symbol of the scheme changes from level to level and the parametrization plays a crucial role in this kind of study , the proofs of the non - stationary case are often more difficult than in the stationary case .",
    "this is why much of the results previously obtained can not be straightforwardly generalized but require a reformulation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ to illustrate the application of the simple but very general algebraic conditions derived , we construct novel subdivision symbols defining new non - stationary subdivision schemes with specified reproduction properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : spaces ] we start by defining the space of exponential polynomials and we characterize some of its special instances that turn out to be really useful in applications .",
    "then , in section [ sec : e - reproduction ] , we provide new theoretical results concerning the algebraic conditions that the symbols of a convergent , binary , linear , non - stationary subdivision scheme should satisfy in order to reproduce functions from a given space of exponential polynomials . finally , in section [ sec : applications ] , novel subdivision schemes are introduced to show how the illustrated conditions can be easily applied to work out non - stationary refinement rules with desired reproduction properties .",

    "<S> we present an accurate investigation of the algebraic conditions that the symbols of a convergent , univariate , binary , non - stationary subdivision scheme should fulfill in order to reproduce spaces of exponential polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> a subdivision scheme is said to possess the property of reproducing exponential polynomials if , for any initial data uniformly sampled from some exponential polynomial function , the scheme yields the same function in the limit . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this property is due to the fact that several functions obtained as combinations of exponential polynomials ( such as conic sections , spirals or special trigonometric and hyperbolic functions ) are of great interest in graphical and engineering applications . since the space of exponential polynomials trivially includes standard polynomials , the results in this work extend the recently developed theory on polynomial reproduction to the non - stationary context . </S>",
    "<S> a significant application of the derived algebraic conditions on the subdivision symbols is the construction of new non - stationary subdivision schemes with specified reproduction properties .    _ </S>",
