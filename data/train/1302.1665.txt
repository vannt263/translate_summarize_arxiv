    "a relativistic fluid approach has been applied to various high - energy phenomena in astrophysics , nuclear , and hadron physics , bringing a lot of interesting and outstanding results . in particular",
    ", recent relativistic hydrodynamic analyses revealed a new and interesting feature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) started operation in 2000 , a number of discoveries have been made , providing insight into quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition and the qgp .",
    "one of the most interesting and surprising outcomes at rhic was the production of the strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) , which was confirmed by both theory and experiment .",
    "the highlights are : ( i ) strong elliptic flow , which suggests that collectivity and thermalization are achieved ; ( ii ) strong jet quenching , which confirms that hot and dense matter is created after collisions ; ( iii ) the quark number scaling of elliptic flow , which indicates that the hot quark soup is produced @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamic models have made a significant contribution to these achievements .",
    "for example , at the time , only hydrodynamic models could explain the strong elliptic flow at rhic , which was considered to be direct evidence for the production of sqgp at rhic .",
    "because of the success of the relativistic hydrodynamic model at rhic , hydrodynamic analysis has become a useful and powerful tool for understanding dynamics of hot and dense matter in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in the early stage of the hydrodynamic studies at rhic ,",
    "viscosity effects were not taken into account . however , detailed analyses of experimental data in relativistic heavy - ion collisions gradually revealed limitation of ideal hydrodynamic models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the first time , quantitative analyses of elliptic flow were performed with a relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model .",
    "the authors showed that ideal hydrodynamics overestimates elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum , and that a hydrodynamic calculation with finite viscosity explains the experimental data better .",
    "since then , the main purpose of the phenomenological study for relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc has been to obtain detailed information of bulk properties of qgp , such as its transport coefficients .",
    "besides , recent high statistical experimental data at rhic and lhc require more rigorous numerical treatment on the hydrodynamical models .",
    "recently both at rhic and lhc the higher harmonic anisotropic flow , which is the fourier coefficient of particle yield as a function of azimuthal angle , has been reported .",
    "one of the origins of the higher harmonics is event - by - event fluctuations . to obtain the precise value of transport coefficients with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics , we need to choose an algorithm with small numerical dissipation and treat the inviscid part with care .",
    "usually each algorithm has advantages or disadvantages in terms of coding , computational time , precision and stability . thus far , unfortunately , only limited attention has been paid to numerical aspects in hydrodynamic models for high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in this article",
    ", we present a state - of - the - art algorithm for solving the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics equation with the qcd equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "our applications require a numerical scheme that can treat a shock wave appropriately and has less numerical dissipation in order to gain comprehensive understanding of recent high - energy heavy - ion collision physics .",
    "these advantages can be achieved by implementing a riemann solver for the relativistic ideal hydrodynamics . in particular , we propose a new riemann solver for the qcd eos at low baryon density , which has not been considered in astrophysical application where baryon density is usually much higher .",
    "we derive our riemann solver by analytically solving the relativistic riemann problem for low baryon density , within the approximation scheme proposed by @xcite . as we will see in section [ sec : num_test ] , where we perform several numerical tests , our new algorithm with the riemann solver has an advantage over other algorithms such as kurganov - tadmor ( kt ) @xcite , nessyahu - tadmor ( nt ) @xcite and shasta @xcite from the point of view of analyses for current relativistic heavy - ion collisions . by implementing our new riemann solver for relativistic ideal hydrodynamics in a numerical scheme for causal viscous hydrodynamics",
    "recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can also construct a new algorithm for causal viscous hydrodynamics for qgp .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",

    "we mention the key aspects of numerical simulations in relativistic hydrodynamic models , which are classified into ideal versions and viscous ones .",

    "the information for the qcd phase diagram is obtained through the eos used in the hydrodynamic calculation .",

    "historically , in terms of analyses of high - energy heavy - ion collisions , only physical conditions , such as initial conditions , eos and termination conditions of hydrodynamic expansion have been discussed . however , because of the nonlinearity of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations , even if we use the same physical conditions , different numerical schemes would give us different numerical solutions .",
    "furthermore , when we start to investigate viscosity effects and event - by - event fluctuations in recent high statistic experimental data , we need to choose suitable numerical schemes carefully . for numerical stability of hydrodynamic calculation , numerical dissipation is needed .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate physical viscosity in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , we need to avoid or control the effect of numerical dissipation in the numerical relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "accurate numerical schemes can be found in those with riemann solvers for relativistic ideal hydrodynamics ( references therein @xcite ) .",
    "the riemann solver is a method to calculate numerical flux by using the exact solution of the riemann problems at the interfaces separating numerical grid cells , and can be used to describe the flows with strong shocks and sharp discontinuity stably and highly accurately .    here , we mention the basis of hydrodynamics briefly .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamics equations are given by the conservation laws of energy , momentum and baryon number : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath5 is the baryon current . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the cartesian coordinates where the metric tensor @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 . in the case of relativistic ideal fluid , the energy - momentum tensor and baryon current are given by @xmath8 u^\\mu ( x ) u^\\nu   ( x ) - p(x ) g^{\\mu      \\nu } \\ , , \\\\",

    "when the effects of dissipation are included into relativistic hydrodynamics , a rather complicated situation arises .",
    "one of the difficulties is that the naive introduction of viscosities as in the first - order theory , in which the entropy current contains no terms higher than the first - order term in the thermodynamic fluxes , suffers from acausality . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", the second - order terms in heat flow and viscosities have to be included in the expression for the entropy @xcite , but a systematic treatment of these second - order terms has not yet been established .",
    "although there has been remarkable progress toward the construction of a fully - consistent , relativistic viscous hydrodynamical theory for the description of high - energy heavy - ion collisions , there are still ongoing discussions about the formulation of the equations of motion and about the numerical procedures @xcite .    at first order",
    "the new structures are proportional to gradients of the velocity field @xmath14 and the baryon number density @xmath15 , and only three proportionality constants appear : the shear viscosity @xmath16 , the bulk viscosity @xmath17 , and the baryon number conductivity @xmath18 . at second order , many more new parameters related to relaxation phenomena , such as relaxation times for each diffusive modes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 appear .",
    "currently , most viscous hydrodynamical calculations use the relativistic dissipative equations of motion that were derived phenomenologically by israel and stewart @xcite which are utilized in this work ( see appendix [ sec : is ] ) , and their variants @xcite .",
    "recently , a second - order viscous hydrodynamics from ads / cft correspondence was derived @xcite , as well as a set of generalized israel - stewart equations from kinetic theory via grad s 14-momentum expansion , which have several new terms @xcite .",
    "however , a qualitatively different first - order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamical scheme was also proposed on the basis of renormalization - group consideration @xcite .",
    "there are two choices for the local rest frame in a relativistic viscous hydrodynamics equation .",
    "one is the eckart frame @xcite , where the direction of the four - velocity is the same as that of the particle flux vector .",
    "the other is the landau - lifshitz frame @xcite , where the direction of the four - velocity is the same as that of energy flux vector .",
    "because in high - energy collisions at rhic and lhc the baryon number density is very small ( section [ sec : qcd_eos ] ) , the landau - lifshitz frame is more suitable for qcd at high temperature and low baryon number density .",
    "the phase diagram of qcd matter has been investigated for decades . in fig . [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] , a schematic qcd phase diagram is depicted with the axes of temperature @xmath22 and baryon chemical potential @xmath23 . among the six flavors of quarks in the standard model",
    ", we only consider the three light flavors of quarks ( up , down , and strange ) with physical quark masses .",
    "the phase diagram is characterized by three typical phases : a hadronic phase , a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , and a color super - conducting ( csc ) phase . in the hadronic phase , which is realized in the ground state of the qcd hamiltonian ( vacuum state ) , the chiral symmetry of qcd is broken , and quarks and gluons are confined in the hadrons . in the qgp phase , which was realized in the early universe ,",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored and quarks and gluons are liberated from the hadrons . in the csc phase , which may be realized inside neutron stars , the quarks on the fermi surface form cooper pairs and are condensed to create a super - conducting state . for further details of the qcd phase diagram , see the review @xcite .    in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the lhc and rhic ,",
    "the relevant region in the qcd phase diagram is high - temperature ( @xmath24-@xmath25 mev ) , low baryon density ( @xmath26-@xmath27mev ) one . in this region",
    ", there is a transition from the qgp phase to the hadron phase .",
    "the transition is a crossover confirmed by the state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulation @xcite , in contrast to the bag eos , which is a phenomenological equation of state with a first - order phase transition and has been widely utilized in previous hydrodynamic models . in the high - temperature , low baryon density region",
    ", we expect that the qcd eos can be approximated by taking into account the leading - order contribution of the finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "in other words , due to the charge conjugation ( @xmath28 ) symmetry of the qcd , the @xmath28-even quantities , e.g. pressure , energy density , temperature , and sound velocity , are approximated by those at vanishing baryon chemical potential , while the @xmath28-odd quantities , e.g. baryon density , and baryon chemical potential , are approximated by the first - order contribution of the chemical potential .",
    "note that in this approximation the @xmath28-even quantities are independent of @xmath23 , while the @xmath28-odd quantities depend on both @xmath22 and @xmath23 in principle .",
    "for example , @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the baryon number susceptibility . is defined in terms of differentials of pressure along the isentropes : @xmath31 when @xmath32 is positive , the convexity condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "our approximation corresponds to @xmath33 at @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is easily confirmed at @xmath36 . ]",
    "although the first - principles lattice qcd simulation is limited at vanishing baryon chemical potential , we can access the thermodynamic properties at low baryon chemical potential by using @xmath37 in the above approximation .",
    "indeed , combining the result of the state - of - the - art lattice simulation @xcite ( @xmath38-@xmath39 at @xmath40-@xmath25 mev , @xmath41-@xmath42 at @xmath40-@xmath43 mev ) and the typical values of the baryon chemical potential in the heavy - ion collisions ( @xmath44 mev at rhic and 1 mev at lhc @xcite ) , we can estimate the importance of the next - to - leading order term in the pressure by taking its ratio with the leading - order term @xmath45 , which yields only a 0.4% correction at the rhic and a 0.00075% one at the lhc .",
    "therefore , we regard this approximation to be quantitatively reliable in all the regions of the qgp fireball at both rhic and lhc .    in numerical tests in section [ sec : num_test ] , we will consider an eos for free gas of gluons ( free gas eos ) and that for realistic interacting quarks and gluons calculated by the lattice qcd simulation ( lattice qcd eos ) , which we plot in fig .",
