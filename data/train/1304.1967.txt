    "open clusters are useful examples for studying the dynamical evolution of stellar systems and the chemical evolution of the galactic disc , because the stars in an open cluster are assumed to have the same chemical and dynamical properties owing to of their shared origin . because open clusters orbit about the centre of the galaxy near the galactic plane , they are frequently disturbed by both giant molecular clouds and the tidal forces originating from the galactic disc .",
    "in particular , old open clusters can be tracers of the structural and evolutionary history of the galactic disc @xcite .",
    "the structure of the old open clusters can be changed by dynamical evolution driven by internal and external tidal forces .",
    "energy equipartition due to encounters among member stars @xcite leads to mass segregation , which is characterized by the concentration of high - mass stars in the cluster s centre , and an isotropic distribution of low - mass stars rambling throughout the cluster .",
    "mass segregation results in the steeper slope of the mass function in the outer region of the cluster @xcite .",
    "some fraction of low - mass stars evaporates from the cluster to create the halo surrounding the cluster @xcite .",
    "the evaporation of low - mass stars also increases the size of the cluster because of the reduction of the binding energy .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we derived the luminosity function ( lf ) of the clusters using the membership probability defined in equation 4 . because the number of stars at each magnitude interval , corrected for the field star contamination , is equal to the effective number of stars @xmath1 , it can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the membership probability and incompleteness correction factor , respectively , for stars with a magnitude interval @xmath5 .",
    "then , the lfs at a radial distance @xmath6 from the cluster centre can be determined based on @xmath7 .    we considered three regions , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , to derive radial dependence of lfs .",
    "the half number radius @xmath11 is the radius where the number of stars becomes half of the total number of stars within @xmath12 .",
    "they are @xmath13 and @xmath14 for ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 , respectively .",
    "8 shows the radial lfs derived for the two open clusters , ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 .",
    "the general trend of the lfs of the two open clusters under consideration is a gradual change of the peak positions ; the lfs peak closes to the bright end of the inner region ( @xmath8 ) , whereas the peak closes to the faint end in the outer region ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this means that fainter stars are likely to be found in the outer regions of the clusters , i.e. , there is a clear evidence of mass segregation in the two clusters , ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 .",
    "similar signatures of mass segregation were reported for m11 @xcite , pleiades and praesepe @xcite , ngc 2099 @xcite and ngc 6819 @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for the observed mass segregation seems to be the dynamical evolution that leads to the energy equilibrium because these open clusters are old enough to be relaxed .",
    "[ density_contour ]      to investigate the morphology and halo structure of the clusters , we plotted 2 dimensional effective surface number density distributions of ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 in fig .",
    "9 and fig .",
    "10 , respectively .",
    "we plotted two contour levels .",
    "one corresponds to the effective surface number density of @xmath15 showing the representive morphology of the cluster and the other corresponds to the @xmath16 of the background density ( @xmath17 ) showing the outer morphology of the cluster which can be detected above the background fluctuations . as can be seen in fig .",
    "9 and fig .",
    "10 , ngc 1245 is more elongated than ngc 2506 .",
    "there seems to be no relation between the direction of the major axis of ngc 1245 and the direction of the cluster proper motion @xcite .",
    "we plotted the directions of cluster proper motion @xcite along with the directions of the galactic latitude and longitude for comparison .",
    "there are some features resembling tidal tails in the north - west of ngc 1245 .",
    "the surface number densities of these features are comparable to the @xmath16 of the @xmath17 which is @xmath18 times the central surface density ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we proposed a new method for determining the cluster membership probability using the spatial positions together with the positions in the cmd .",
    "owing to the ability to assign the membership probability for all the stars in the cluster field , we could trace the morphology of the clusters and derive the radial surface density profiles corrected for the field star contamination .",
    "the validity of the present method of 4-d membership probability is confirmed by comparing our membership probabilities with those from proper motion studies in the central region of ngc 2506 @xcite .",
    "however , our method shows some bias to higher probability for stars in the central regions of the cluster .",
    "this bias is caused by assigning high probabilities to stars in the central regions of the cluster if they are located within the photometric membership boundary in the cmds .",
    "we also tested the robustness of the segregation of non - member stars from the member stars by the monte - carlo simulations and found that the 4-d method assigns membership probability quite convincingly .",
    "the probability of a star with @xmath20 is a real cluster member is about @xmath21 .",
    "however , for better understanding of the structure of open clusters , we need kinematic data .",
    "the two old open clusters ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 show an imprint of the dynamical evolution in their lfs and radial surface density profiles .",
    "the lfs of the inner region of the clusters are dominated by the giant and upper main - sequence stars , whereas those of the outer region of the clusters are dominated by low - mass stars .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in ngc 2506 .",
    "some fraction of low mass stars is expected to be evaporating from the cluster to create the tidal halo surrounding the cluster .",
    "the over - dense regions revealed in the effective number density contour map of ngc 1245 suggest the presence of the tidal halo at @xmath22 in the north - west of ngc 1245 .",
    "the detection of the over - dense regions at @xmath22 was made possible due to our method of membership probability which took into account spatial positions together with the positions in the cmd , in addition to using wide and deep photometry of the two clusters ( paper i ) .",
    "we found that the cluster core radius derived from bright stars is smaller than that from the faint stars .",
    "the dependence of core radius on the luminosity of stars is a strong evidence of the mass segragation in ngc 1245 and ngc 2506 .",
    "mass segregation and evaporation of the low mass stars are natural consequences of the dynamical evolution in relaxed clusters .",
    "stars exchange their kinetic energy through encounters . owing to the equipartition of the kinetic energy , high - mass stars",
    "have relatively low velocity , whereas low mass stars may have velocity that is sufficient to escape from the cluster . if the evaporated stars are tidally disturbed by the galactic disc or giant molecular clouds during their orbital motion , they are likely to be stretched along the orbit @xcite to create tidal tails .",
    "a signature of tidal tail seems to be observed in ngc 1245 but the signal is too low to be confirmed .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
