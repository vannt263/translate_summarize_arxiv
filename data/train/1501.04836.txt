    "our own implementation combines the the codemist standard lisp ( csl)-based version of the computer algebra system reduce  @xcite with the gurobi optimizer  @xcite .",
    "technically , csl provides a foreign function interface that allows us to dynamically load the gurobi c - library at runtime and call its functions from within symbolic mode reduce functions .",
    "gurobi uses the simplex algorithm .",
    "so far we have got no experience with the use of implementations of polynomial methods for lp , like the interior point method  @xcite .",
    "gurobi uses floating point arithmetic with a limited precision .",
    "we want to adress some issues related to this , which we consider of general inteterst , because that floating point approach is typical for simplex - based lp software .    on the one hand ,",
    "lp solvers are quite good at controlling numerical stability . with our comprehensive computations",
    "we have never encountered any problems with false results due to lp rounding errors . on the other hand ,",
    "in line 15 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] we obtain @xmath65 ,  ,  @xmath66 , @xmath232 as floats with small rounding errors .",
    "these rounding errors do not affect correctness but cause a subtle problem : converting @xmath65 , ",
    ",  @xmath66 into fractions , the gcd of their denominators will typically be @xmath233 so that the principal denominator @xmath234 computed in line  18 becomes the very large product of those denominators .",
    "consequently , in line  19 we obtain our final @xmath45 with very large relatively prime integer coordinates .",
    "this , in turn , renders infeasible the exponentiation of increasing powers of @xmath235 with those integer coordinates and substitution of the result into @xmath15 in line  11 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] or in lines  14 , 17 , and 19 of algorithm  [ alg : findposgen ] .",
    "there are two principle ways out , which we call the _ pure lp approach _ and the _ mip approach _ , respectively .",
    "of course , the single design decisions made with these approaches can be recombined to yield further , mixed , approaches .",
    "[ [ the - pure - lp - approach ] ] the pure lp approach + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the pure lp approach tries to get along with the delivered floats .",
    "specifically , lines  1820 in algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] are skipped , and a floating point vector is returned .",
    "the while - loops in line 11 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] and line 17 of algorithm  [ alg : findposgen ] remain correct with floating point exponents @xmath45 .",
    "later , in lines  1112 of algorithm  [ alg : findz ] it is important to convert to rationals .",
    "in particular the substitution of floats into a high - degree polynomial @xmath15 in line  12 could cause considerable numerical instabilities .",
    "subsequent root isolation to floating point precision in line 13 and back - substitution of the obtained floats in line  14 worked well with all our computations .",
    "[ [ the - mip - approach ] ] the mip approach + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    mip stands for _ mixed integer ( linear ) programming_. our lemma  [ le : equiv ] allows us to declare @xmath65 , ",
    ",  @xmath66 as integers to the lp solver right away , while @xmath232 remains real . as mip is np - hard  @xcite , the mip approach is considerably harder than the pure lp approach in terms of theoretical complexity . in practice",
    "there are several advanced algorithms for simplex - based mip solving , which rely in some way on considering an _ lp relaxation _ ,",
    "i.e. , considering integer variables as real variables , and , in the feasible case , trying to construct a mixed real integer feasible point on the basis of an lp solution .",
    "the gurobi solver specifically uses advanced _ cutting plane _",
    "@xcite methods for that construction . for the largest problems discussed with our practical computations in section  [ se : computations ] below ,",
    "we have observed factor of about 3 for milp solving compared to lp solving .",
    "there is an interesting optimization with the mip approach : since in out situation mip feasibility is equivalent to lp feasibility by lemma  [ le : equiv ] , one can generally first check the latter in lines  1415 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] , and in the feasible case rerun for the corresponding mip problem . using this strategy",
    ", there is always at most one mip solving step per root finding problem .",
    "furthermore , one runs mip solving only on feasible instances .",
    "this excludes the really problematic cases , which are lp feasible but not mip feasible problems .    in rare cases one obtains integer solutions which are so large that they render exponentiation and substitution in line  11 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] or in lines  14 , 17 , and 19 of algorithm  [ alg : findposgen ] infeasible .",
    "one can impose a suitable bound on the absolute values of the solutions , and in case of exceeding that bound treat the problem as infeasible , and proceed to the next candidate .",
    "another noteworthy optimization is the symbolic precomputation of a univariate rational function for the while - loop in line 17 of algorithm  [ alg : findposgen ] .",
    "see algorithm  [ alg : precompute ] for details .",
    "a corresponding simpler variant , of course , works also for lines  1012 in algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] .    for root isolation in line  13 of algorithm  [ alg : findz ]",
    "we use the _ vincent  collins  akritas _ method  @xcite .",
    "we obtain a real algebraic number encoded by a univariate defining polynomial and an open isolating interval , which is back - substituted in line  14 , yielding a vector of such real algebraic numbers as the final solution @xmath236 .",
    "[ alg : precompute ]    @xmath237 for a new variable @xmath130    @xmath238    @xmath239    @xmath240",
    "we consider input polynomials originating from 4 different chemical and biological models .",
    "this yields 929 instances altogether . for all of these instances we are checking for zeros with strictly positive coordinates .",
    "it turns out that for 640 of the instances we find @xmath241 $ ] in line 1 of algorithm  [ alg : findpos ] , which tells us that the corresponding polynomial is positive definite ( on the interior of the first hyperoctant ) . running our method on the 289 remaining instances",
    ", it fails in only 7.3  percent of the cases .",
    "table  [ tab : bench ] shows detailed information for the single models .",
    "it also shows size ( number of monomials ) , dimension ( number of variables ) , and the largest degree of an occurring variable for the respective largest instance .",
    "it furthermore shows the maximal computation time for a single instance and the sum of computation times .",
    "all computations have been carried out on a 2.8  ghz xeon e5 - 4640 with the mip approach , yielding exact algebraic number solutions :    .statistics for our practical computations[tab : bench ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that for our particular application the detection of definiteness by our implementation establishes a perfect result . from that point of view",
