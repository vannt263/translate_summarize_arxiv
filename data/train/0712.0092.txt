    "mean - field theories for spin glasses have not been limited to their original aim of explaining peculiar behaviours presented by some magnetic alloys , but have been applied to a large number of complex systems , ranging from biology and optimisation problems to information processing @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic mean - field spin - glass model is the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite . by the application of the replica method",
    ", it was found that the low temperature spin - glass phase is described by a solution with an infinite number of stages of replica symmetry breaking ( @xmath1rsb ) according to a hierarchical scheme proposed by parisi @xcite .",
    "the difficulty posed by the analysis of this solution , analytically as well as numerically , encouraged the investigation of simpler models that retain some of the essential aspects of the sk model .",
    "the generalisation from a spin - glass interaction between pairs of spins to an interaction among sets of @xmath2 spins has attracted considerable interest in this respect @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the limit @xmath3 this model becomes equivalent to the random energy model ( rem)@xcite , which can be solved with or without the help of the replica method .",
    "moreover , the first stage of replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) is shown to be exact for this model .",
    "another instance in which the analysis becomes simpler is the spherical version of the model @xcite .",
    "this model can be exactly solved and exhibits a spin - glass phase described by a stable 1rsb solution for any @xmath0 , even to the lowest temperatures .",
    "experimental works report evidences of a spin - glass behaviour and of coexistence of spin - glass and antiferromagnetic orders , both in diluted antiferromagnetic materials ( e.g. fe@xmath4mg@xmath5cl@xmath6 ) @xcite and in mixed antiferromagnetic compounds ( e.g. fe@xmath4mn@xmath5tio@xmath7 ) @xcite . as a theoretical approach to these systems ,",
    "the two - sublattice sk model was introduced to describe re - entrant transitions from the antiferromagnetic to the spin - glass phase@xcite",
    ". an extended version of this model was investigated in an attempt to reproduce the experimental results observed in the experimental systems mentioned previously@xcite .",
    "needless to say , the solution of the two - sublattice sk model is hard to be analysed analytically as well as numerically . as a simpler model which retains some essential features of the two - sublattice sk model ,",
    "a two - sublattice version of the rem was proposed recently @xcite to explain some experimental results in the disordered antiferromagnetic system fe@xmath8zn@xmath8f@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the foregoing experimental and theoretical investigations motivated us to consider a two - sublattice version of the spherical spin - glass model with multi - spin interactions .",
    "the relative simplicity of the model enables us to investigate the phase diagrams of the model for the full range of parameters .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath9 continuous spins distributed in two sublattices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , each consisting of @xmath12 spins .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an applied magnetic field and @xmath15 is the antiferromagnetic interaction between different sublattices .",
    "the interactions @xmath16 among the set of @xmath17 spins on different sublattices are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath18 where the factor @xmath19 is a matter of convention while the dependence on @xmath12 is needed to ensure an extensive free energy .",
    "the spins , @xmath20 in the @xmath10 sublattice and @xmath21 in the @xmath11 sublattice , are real continuous variables ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath1 .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature and the delta functions impose spherical constraints to ensure the existence of a well - defined limit at low temperatures .",
    "in the replica method the self - averaged free energy per spin is computed by means of @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the average over the gaussian random variables @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "the saddle - point equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 which are coupled to similar equations obtained by the interchange @xmath37 .",
    "here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the overlap between replicas , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the sublattice magnetisations , @xmath43    to evaluate the free energy explicitly , it is necessary to impose some structure on @xmath44 and @xmath34 . in this work we consider the replica - symmetric ( rs ) and 1rsb _ anstze _ , the latter being the most general solution for this model @xcite .",
    "usually the rs form of the overlap matrix is appropriate for the description of systems when there is only a single equilibrium state .",

    "the glassy behaviour is signalled by ergodicity breaking , with the emergence of many inequivalent pure states that are described by the breaking of replica symmetry @xcite .",

    "we present the results only for @xmath58 since the the general features of the phase diagrams do not depend sensitively on @xmath17 .",
    "the zero - field phase diagram is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we found four phases which meet at a multicritical point : the paramagnetic ( p ) phase , antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase , spin glass ( sg ) phase and mixed ( mx ) phase ( or glassy antiferromagnetic phase ) .",
    "the p and af phases show no replica symmetry breaking and are described by the rs solution .",
    "the p phase is characterised by the order parameters @xmath60 and the af phase by @xmath61 the sg and mx phases present replica symmetry breaking and are described by 1rsb solution .",
    "the sg phase is characterised by the order parameters @xmath62 and the mx phase by @xmath63    if we make the substitutions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( [ f1rsb]-[xeq ] ) , these equations become identical to those of one - sublattice @xmath0-spin spherical model with ferromagnetic interactions @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "thus in the absence of an external field the results of the one - sublattice model can be translated to the two - sublattice model simply by exchanging the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orderings .",
    "the p - af and the sg - mx transitions are continuous and are characterised by the appearance of spontaneous sublattice magnetisations @xmath70 in the af and mx phases .",
    "the p - sg and the af - mx transitions are characterised by the emergence of 1rsb solution with higher free energy than the rs solution in the sg and mx phases . in the sg to the p transition @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "vanishes discontinuously .",
    "thus there is a discontinuous one - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( d1rsb ) transition .",
    "the af - mx transition is also a d1rsb transition to the left of the maximum in the boundary of mx phase , but to the right of the maximum @xmath73 and @xmath74 merge continuously at the transition with @xmath75 . thus there is a continuous one - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( c1rsb ) transition .",
    "we observe that although the spin - glass order parameters change discontinuously across the d1rsb transition , thermodynamically it is a continuous transition @xcite .      the phase diagram of the model in a uniform external field is shown in figure [ figure2 ] for @xmath77 and @xmath58 .",
    "we again found four phases that meet at a multicritical point .",
    "the p and af phases show no replica symmetry breaking and are described by the rs solution . the p phase is characterised by the order parameters @xmath78 and the af phase by @xmath79 the sg and mx phases present replica symmetry breaking and are described by 1rsb solution .",
    "the sg phase is characterised by the order parameters @xmath80 and the mx phase by @xmath81    the order parameters as functions of the external field is plotted in figure [ figure3 ] for @xmath58 , @xmath77 and @xmath82 , when the system undergoes transitions from mx to sg and from sg to p phases for increasing fields .",
    "the mx - sg transition takes place at @xmath83 . at this transition",
    "the sublattice order parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 become identical with @xmath90 , implying a continuous transition between rsb phases . at the sg - p transition at @xmath91 the order parameters @xmath73 and",
    "@xmath74 merge continuously with @xmath75 , indicating a c1rsb transition .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows the order parameters as functions of the temperature for @xmath58 , @xmath77 and @xmath92 , when the system undergoes transitions from mx to af and from af to p phases for increasing temperatures .",
    "the mx - af transition takes place at @xmath93 . at this transition the sublattice magnetisations @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 meet continuously .",
    "however @xmath87 and @xmath89 do not merge continuously with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "also @xmath94 at the transition , which indicates a d1rsb transition .",
    "the af - p transition at @xmath95 is a conventional continuous transition between rs phases .",
    "the free energies of the rs and 1rsb solutions for @xmath58 , @xmath77 and @xmath92 are shown in figure [ figure5 ] across the mx - af transition .",
    "we observe that in the mx phase the free energy of the 1rsb solution is higher than the rs solution .",
    "a similar behaviour was also found in the one - sublattice model @xcite . in the replica approach",
    "this indicates that we must choose the 1rsb rather than the rs solution @xcite .",
    "figures [ assghtj0](a)-(f ) show the evolution of the field - temperature phase diagrams for increasing values of the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath96 . in figure [ assghtj0](a ) for @xmath97",
    "only the sg and the p phases are present .",
    "the p - sg boundary has a maximum .",
    "it is a d1rsb transition to the left of maximum and c1rsb transition to the right .",
    "this feature of p - sg transition is common to all the subsequent phase diagrams . in figure [ assghtj0](b ) for @xmath98 the af and mx phases are present for small magnetic fields .",
    "the p - af and mx - sg transitions are always continuous .",
    "the mx - af transition is of d1rsb type . in figure [ assghtj0](c ) for @xmath99 the mx phase extends to zero temperature . in figure [ assghtj0](d )",
    "the af - mx boundary exhibits a c1rsb transition in the low field side .",
    "this feature of the af - mx transition which starts at @xmath100 is common to all subsequent phase diagrams . in figure [ assghtj0](e ) for @xmath101 the mx phase is no longer present at zero field .",
    "finally , in figure [ assghtj0](f ) the d1rsb transition line has disappeared in the p - sg boundary , and only the c1rsb transition line remains .",
    "also the the d1rsb transition in the mx - af boundary becomes again a c1rsb transition before reaching the multicritical point .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams of a @xmath17-spin antiferromagnetic spherical spin - glass model using the replica method . for this class of models",
    "the first step in the replica symmetry breaking is sufficient @xcite .",
    "the model is a two - sublattice version of the @xmath0-spin ferromagnetic spherical spin - glass model @xcite .",
    "the two models become essentially identical in their properties in the absence of an external field if the roles of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic orderings are exchanged .",
    "the model can also be considered as a spherical version of the antiferromagnetic sk model @xcite and the antiferromagnetic rem model @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed numerical study for the representative case @xmath58 .",
    "the phase diagrams comprise the paramagnetic ( p ) phase , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase , the spin - glass ( sg ) phase and mixed ( mx ) or glassy antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "all the transitions between these phases are continuous in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "however the spin - glass order parameters may change continuously ( c1rsb ) or discontinuously ( d1rsb ) in the sg - p and mx - af transitions .",
    "previous studies of the same problem in antiferromagnetic sk model @xcite and the antiferromagnetic rem model @xcite have yielded qualitatively similar phase diagrams . however",
    "the p - sg and af - mx transitions are of continuous @xmath1rsb type in the antiferromagnetic sk model @xcite and of continuous c1rsb type in the rem model @xcite .",
