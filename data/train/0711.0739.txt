    "even before the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , research in organic and heavy fermion compounds lead to the suggestion that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations can promote superconductivity with an order parameter that changes sign along the diagonal of the brillouin zone , so - called d - wave superconductivity  @xcite",
    ". this question can be studied using the hubbard model . at strong coupling ,",
    "namely interaction strength @xmath7 larger than the bandwidth , mean - field factorization of the equivalent @xmath8 model already reveals the possibility of d - wave pairing .",
    "the situation is quite different at weak coupling .",
    "there , no mean - field factorization of the hubbard model leads to a d - wave superconducting state . instead , magnetic fluctuations are dominant .",
    "pairing must then be seen in a two - stage process .",
    "first , sufficiently strong magnetic fluctuations are formed , then the corresponding low energy bosons can act as a glue for pairs , in a manner analogous to what phonons do in the standard bcs theory .",
    "in other words , at strong coupling it seems that superexchange suffices to form pairs , while at weak coupling there is an intermediate process where mediating bosons must be formed before they can bind pairs  @xcite .",
    "there is now ample numerical and analytical evidence for d - wave superconductivity in the one - band hubbard model  @xcite even though there are some dissenting voices  @xcite .",
    "while the coupling in high - temperature superconductors or the layered bedt organics is strong enough to lead to a mott insulating state at half - filling , it is still interesting to understand more deeply the physics at weak to intermediate coupling in the absence of the mott insulating state .",
    "there , numerical methods are limited by the fact that small system sizes do not allow magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate wave vectors .    in this paper",
    ", we study the two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling . in two - dimensions",
    ", the mermin - wagner theorem implies that there is no long - range magnetic order at finite temperature .",
    "nevertheless , there is a crossover temperature at which the magnetic correlation length starts to grow exponentially as temperature decreases .",
    "one enters the so - called renormalized classical regime .",
    "we thus study the influence of second - neighbor hopping @xmath9 and of interaction strength @xmath7 on the magnetic crossover temperature .",
    "berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless superconductivity is allowed in two - dimensions and can be induced by these magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we answer the question of the relation between the wave vector of the dominant magnetic fluctuations and the symmetry and magnitude of d - wave superconductivity  @xcite , as well as the question of the relative importance of the non - interacting density of states , the double occupancy , the magnetic correlation length , and the detailed shape of the fermi surface on superconductivity .",
    "we will use the two - particle self - consistent ( tpsc ) approach  @xcite that is non - perturbative and valid at weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "this method has been benchmarked by comparisons with quantum monte carlo calculations wherever possible .",
    "it gives results for the pseudogap that are in agreement with experiments in electron - underdoped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the superconducting transition temperature obtained  @xcite by this method is very close to more accurate results from the dynamical cluster approximation  @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the model and the tpsc method , explaining in detail why it is a method of choice for this problem .",
    "we next present our numerical results , discuss various physical aspects that can be found in the @xmath10 model and compare our results with other results in earlier literature .",
    "we then discuss the relationship between d - wave superconductivity and magnetic fluctuations in terms of a simple physical picture and conclude .",
    "we study the hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operator for electrons of spin @xmath14 at site @xmath15 .",
    "the hopping matrix element @xmath16 is between nearest - neighbors @xmath17 whereas @xmath9 is between next - nearest - neighbors @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the density operator at site @xmath15 , and @xmath7 is the on - site interaction .",
    "particle - hole transformation with and without a phase factor shows that at half - filling the results do not depend on the sign of either @xmath16 or @xmath9 .",
    "the tpsc approach that we use in this paper satisfies the pauli principle @xmath20 , conservation of spin and charge as well as the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "in addition , it includes renormalization of interaction ( kanamori - brckner ) and has a self - energy that includes the vertex corrections that must be taken into account in the absence of the conditions necessary to satisfy midgal s theorem .",
    "tpsc also achieves consistency between one- and two - particle quantities in the form of the sum rule relating potential energy to the trace of self - energy times green function . at weak",
    "to intermediate coupling ( @xmath21 ) , detailed comparisons with benchmark quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite reveal that tpsc is accurate to a few percent .    in this approach , spin and charge susceptiblities @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 have random phase approximation ( rpa)-like forms but with two different effective interactions @xmath24 and @xmath25 that are then determined self - consistently .",
    "although the susceptiblities have a rpa functional form , the physical properties of the theory are very different from the rpa because of the self - consistency condition on @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the necessity to have two different effective interactions for spin and charge",
    "is dictated by the pauli exclusion principle @xmath20 which implies that the local values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related to only one local pair correlation function @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , using the fluctuation - disspation theorem in matsubara formalism , we have the exact sum rules @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 the wave vectors of an n - site lattice , and with @xmath31 the bosonic matsubara frequencies .",
    "the pauli principle @xmath20 applied to the left - hand side of both equations with the tpsc expressions for @xmath22 , @xmath23 on the right - hand side leads to    @xmath32    @xmath33    with @xmath34 the susceptiblities calculated from green functions whose constant self - energy can be absorbed in the chemical potential .",
    "hence , @xmath34 takes the non - interacting form .",
    "if @xmath26 is known , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined from the above equations .",
    "the key quantity @xmath26 can be obtained from monto carlo simulations or by other means .",
    "however , it can also be obtained self - consistently by adding to above set of equations the relation @xmath35    equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) define a set of self - consistent equations for @xmath24 that involve only two - particle quantities .",
    "@xmath25 is determined by substituting in eq.(4 ) the value of @xmath26 that is obtained from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .    following the procedure introduced in ref .",
    "one can show that the self - energy can be calculated from @xmath36 where the matsubara frequency associated with @xmath37 is fermionic and that associated with @xmath38 is bosonic . in @xmath39",
    "the self - energy is a constant that can be absorbed in the chemical potential so that effectively @xmath39 is the non - interacting green function for half - filling .    as usual we can compute the spectral function from @xmath40 where @xmath41 the interacting chemical potential @xmath42 is found by fixing the number of particles calculated from @xmath43 to half - filling .",
    "the above formalism can be extended  @xcite to compute pairing correlations .",
    "basically , the above steps are repeated in the presence of an infinitesimal external pairing field that is eventually set to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "this allows us to obtain the particle - particle irreducible vertex in nambu space from the functional derivative of the off - diagonal @xmath44 with respect to the off - diagonal green function .",
    "the @xmath45-wave susceptibility is defined by @xmath46 with the @xmath45-wave pair creation operator @xmath47 , @xmath48 being a form factor for a representative gap symmetry , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the time - ordering operator , and @xmath51 is imaginary time .",
    "the final expression for the d - wave susceptibility in the zero - frequency limit can be written as follows , if we use the notation where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote both wave vector and fermionic matsubara frequency ,    @xmath54    in this equation , @xmath55 for @xmath56 symmetry and @xmath57 for @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "details of the calculational procedure are explained in ref .  .",
    "the only difference is that , in the present paper , double occupancy is always computed self - consistently with eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) . at high temperature",
    "the pairing susceptibility obtained from the above approach is in quantitative agreement with benchmark quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the sign problem , the latter are not available at very low temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , temperatures in the simulations are low enough to observe the effect of the pseudogap .    since the expression for the susceptibility eq .",
    "( [ suscep_d ] ) contains only the first two terms of the infinite bethe - salpeter series , we use the temperature where the contribution of the vertex part ( exchange of one spin and charge fluctuation ) becomes equal to that of the direct part of the @xmath45-wave pairing susceptibility  @xcite as a rough estimate for the transition temperature for @xmath45-wave superconductivity .",
    "in other words , we look for the equality of the sign and the magnitude of the two terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ suscep_d ] ) .",
    "this choice is motivated by the statement that @xmath59 diverges when @xmath60 . the true kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature in two dimensions is expected to occur below the temperature determined from the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the temperatures that we will find for the transition temperature are thus upper bounds .",

    "one can define the crossover temperature @xmath66 as the temperature at which the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath67 becomes equal to the thermal de broglie wavelength . at this temperature ,",
    "a pseudogap begins to appear at hot spots in the zero frequency single - particle spectral weight  @xcite .",
    "hot spots are points of the fermi surface that are linked by the wave vector where the magnetic fluctuations are becoming large .    in practice , as soon as the correlation length becomes relatively large compared with the lattice spacing , the rise in @xmath67 as temperature is lowered is rather sharp . for convenience , we thus choose @xmath66 as that temperature where @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the wave vectors where the response function has a maximum .",

    "the phase diagram in the @xmath65 plane has been obtained by the path - integeral renormalization group ( pirg ) approach  @xcite . restricting ourselves to the region @xmath84 of that paper , we find that the area of our pm state is smaller . however , the region where @xmath72 fluctuations occur is quite close .",
    "they find a @xmath85 phase for @xmath86 like us but at @xmath87 due to the finite size of the pirg calculations , they are not sensitive to the incommensurate spin density waves that we find .",

    "no singlet superconductivity occurs in the vicinity of the change in fermi surface topology because of the incommensurability and smallness of the fluctuations .     as a function of @xmath9 , calculated at half - filling with an energy resolution @xmath148 .",
    "spin degeneracy is included.,width=321 ]    the single particle density of states of the non - interacting system is not a major factor in the occurrence of d - wave superconductivity .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ dos ] that shows that there is no correlation with the maximum @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ tc ] and peaks in the single particle density of states .",
    "there is a jump in density of states near @xmath135 where fermi surface topology changes .",
    "the only case where the fermi surface coincides with a van hove singularity in the single - particle density of states is at @xmath107 and in that case there is no d - wave superconductivity , contrary to naive expectations .",
    "this is because the nesting allows strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations at @xmath72 to open a pseudogap over the whole fermi surface .",
    "this is illustrated in ref .  .",
    "the pseudogap removes density of states from the fermi energy and is detrimental to d - wave superconductivity  @xcite . the same phenomenon is seen at @xmath147 where there is also nearly perfect nesting . in the presence of a finite @xmath9 , the pseudogap is created only at hot spots and d - wave superconductivity can arise .",
    "our estimate of @xmath4 from the normal state rests on the fact that at @xmath4 the vertex equation deduced from the bethe - salpeter equation becomes singular . in that case",
    ", the vertex equation has the same structure , symmetry - wise , as the bcs gap equation .",
    "one can thus understand very simply the relation between the symmetry of the d - wave order parameter and the underlying magnetic fluctuations .",
    "normally , one would project the interaction potential in the different pairing channels  @xcite .",
    "a less rigorous but more intuitive approach follows ref .   and starts from the bcs gap equation @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the quasiparticle energy and @xmath151 the fermi function .",
    "even though the effective potential @xmath152 for singlet pairing due to spin fluctuations is always positive ( repulsive ) , it can lead to an effective negative ( attractive ) potential for @xmath56-wave superconductivity if it is peaked at @xmath153 and symmetry related wave vectors , as illustrated on the left of fig .",
    "[ bcsorigin ] . indeed , take a value @xmath154 along the @xmath125 axis where the gap is positive .",
    "then the largest contribution to the integral over @xmath155 will come from a region around @xmath155 located at @xmath156 , where the gap is negative , such that the condition @xmath157 is satisfied as closely as possible .",
    "the change in sign of the gap allows a solution of the gap equation even with @xmath158 positive .",
    "( clearly also , increasing the strength of the interaction will lead to a higher @xmath4 . )",
    "the analogous argument explains why @xmath159 , @xmath160 scattering favors @xmath58-wave superconductivity , and why magnetic fluctuations that are peaked at incommensurate wave vectors are not favorable to any of the allowed singlet pairing symmetries on the square lattice .",
    "( in addition for a given @xmath7 the magnitude of fluctuations at incommensurate vectors is smaller than at commensurate vectors ) .",
    "while we have not studied the following question in detail , we note that incommensurate wave vectors may be favorable to pairing in triplet channels such as p - wave , ( @xmath161 )  @xcite .",
    "there is however a change in sign of the effective interaction in the triplet channel  @xcite .",
    "that kind of mechanism may occur in the heavy fermion compound @xmath162  @xcite for example .    according to anderson  @xcite , that physics whereby the pair state is orthogonal to the repulsive core of the coulomb interaction",
    "was explained by pitaevskii and brckner  @xcite . note also that in our approach , we neglect the feedback of superconductivity on spin fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in the present case the non - interacting density of states has little influence on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "self - energy effects can strongly modify the effective density of states by creating a pseudogap that is detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "self - energy effects are not so important in calculations that do not contain the pseudogap  @xcite .",
    "we saw the suppression of superconductivity by the pseudogap at @xmath107 for example .",
    "that suppression is already apparent at high temperature in quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite and is reproduced by tpsc within a few percent in that regime . in apparent contradiction with the suppression of superconductivity by strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the presence of nesting , in quantum cluster approaches  @xcite one does not see the suppression of d - wave superconductivity at half - filling for @xmath107 at weak to intermediate coupling ( i.e. below the mott transition ) , unless long - range antiferromagnetism is allowed . this is because for the small cluster sizes considered , the normal - state magnetic correlation length can not become large enough to create a weak coupling pseudogap .",
    "indeed , a weak coupling pseudogap can barely be seen in ref .   for cluster sizes @xmath163 , even though they are larger than the @xmath164 clusters in ref .  .",
    "it is only at even larger cluster sizes that the weak coupling pseudogap appears in dca calculations  @xcite .",
    "the difference between weak and strong coupling pseudogaps has been discussed for example in refs .  .",
    "in electron - phonon mediated superconductivity , it has been found that the phonon frequencies near @xmath165 are the most efficient ones for pairing  @xcite . in the present case",
    "the wave vector of the magnetic fluctuations is also important . although we have not studied the importance of the frequency dependence in detail , it is possible to make the following remarks .",
    "take @xmath56 superconductivity . for small @xmath9 , where superconductivity is reduced by self - energy effects coming from the pseudogap , the important frequencies are less than temperature in energy units because @xmath4 occurs in the renormalized classical regime . at larger @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is reduced by incommensuration effects and deviations to nesting",
    ", the pseudogap occurs at lower temperature than @xmath4 hence finite frequencies larger than temperature are still important .",
    "optimal @xmath4 occurs between these two cases .",
    "we have studied the conditions for the appearance of magnetic - fluctuation induced d - wave superconductivity in the half - filled hubbard model in two dimensions .",
    "we have shown that at weak to intermediate coupling , the symmetry of the d - wave order parameter is determined by the wave vector of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "those that are near @xmath72 lead to @xmath56-wave ( @xmath105 ) superconductivity while those that are near @xmath74 induce @xmath58-wave ( @xmath106 ) superconductivity .",
    "the dominant wave vector for magnetic fluctuations is determined by the shape of the fermi surface so we find that @xmath56-wave superconductivity occurs for values of @xmath9 that are relatively small while @xmath58-wave superconductivity occurs for @xmath146 .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath9 the magnetic fluctuations are smaller and incommensurate so no singlet superconductivity appears .",
    "the maximum value that @xmath4 can take as a function of @xmath9 increases with interaction strength .",
    "all of the above can easily be understood physically from simple bcs - like arguments . however , contrary to what is expected from bcs , the non - interacting single - particle density of states does not play a dominant role . with fermi surfaces where hot spots can create a pseudogap on nearly all the fermi surface ( as in the @xmath107 case ) ,",
    "self - energy effects hinder d - wave superconductivity , even though the strength of magnetic fluctuations can be very large . in that case , the large inelastic scattering rates are pair breaking and remove states near the fermi level , decreasing the tendency to d - wave superconductivity .",
    "there is thus an optimal value of @xmath9 ( frustration ) for superconductivity . for @xmath56 superconductivity in underfrustrated systems ( small @xmath9 )",
    "@xmath4 occurs below the temperature @xmath100 where the crossover to the renormalized classical regime occurs . in other words , at @xmath4 the antiferromagnetic correlation length is much larger than the thermal de broglie wave length .",
    "the opposite relationship between these lengths occurs for overfrustrated systems ( @xmath9 larger than optimal ) where @xmath4 is larger than @xmath100 .",
    "the two temperatures are comparable for optimally frustrated systems .",
    "but in all cases , at @xmath4 the antiferromagnetic correlation length is larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "comparisons with experiments on heavy - fermion compounds , quasi one - dimensional organic metals and the question of the interplay of incommensurate magnetic fluctuations and triplet pairing is left for future work .",
