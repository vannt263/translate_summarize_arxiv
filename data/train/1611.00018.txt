    "furthermore , one may also wonder if these gws journeying over a size - able fraction of our observable universe could experience the expansion of space itself , as well as interact with the intervening inhomogeneities  thereby picking up additional features that could in turn provide us with novel probes of dark energy and dark matter .    in this paper",

    "since we are working only to first order in metric perturbations , it is physically fruitful to employ the well - developed gauge - invariant cosmological linear perturbation theory because once the solutions are non - trivial , they can not be rendered trivial simply by transforming to a  nearby \" coordinate system  and therefore ought to play key roles in characterizing physical observables such as the strain measured by a gw detector . in @xcite , where we stumbled upon a tail - induced gw memory effect ( to be explained shortly ) in de sitter / dark energy and matter dominated universes , only the 4-dimensional ( 4d )",

    "more recently , tolish and wald @xcite have extended the 4d gw memory analysis to the full set of gauge - invariant scalar , vector and tensor metric variables . in this paper , while we specialize to a constant@xmath19 cosmology from the outset , we shall tackle not only the gauge - invariant scalar - vector - tensor perturbations but also provide analytic solutions for the relevant green s functions in all dimensions higher than three .",
    "one key gw observable is the fractional displacement between a pair of test masses that comprises part of a hypothetical experiment .",
    "it is convenient to assume that these test masses are freely falling and co - moving in some given spacetime , so their spatial coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 are time independent .",
    "as we demonstrate in appendix , if we denote the proper spatial distance between the masses at a fixed time as @xmath22 $ ] , and if we began our gw experiment at time @xmath23 , then the fractional displacement @xmath24 \\equiv ( l[\\eta]-l[\\eta'])/l[\\eta']$ ] is given by the following integral of the total change in the spatial metric expressed in synchronous gauge : @xmath25   = - \\frac{\\widehat{n}^i \\widehat{n}^j}{2 } \\int_{0}^{1 } \\delta\\chi_{ij } { \\text{d}}\\lambda   + \\mathcal{o}\\left [ ( \\chi_{\\mu\\nu})^2,(\\eta-\\eta ' ) \\dot{a}[\\eta']/a[\\eta ' ] \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where here and throughout the rest of the paper an overdot always denotes a derivative with respect to the time coordinate being used ; @xmath26 is the unit radial vector pointing from one mass to the other ; and @xmath27   - \\chi_{ij}\\left [ \\eta ' , \\vec{y}_0 + \\lambda \\left(\\vec{z}_0-\\vec{y}_0\\right ) \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the argument @xmath28 describes the euclidean straight line joining @xmath29 . )    suppose the primary wave train of some gw event has just passed our detector .",

    "in such a scenario , eq . then informs us that the fractional distortion becomes permanent : @xmath33 by placing pairs of test masses with different orientations @xmath34 , and by comparing the pair - separations before and after the passage of the gw signal , we may thus detect whether such a permanent fractional distortion of space itself has occurred .",
    "the gw memory effect is not the only reason motivating us to solve the perturbed cosmological system at hand . since @xcite",
    "we have been motivated by the possibility that future - generation gw detectors such as lisa may hear gws emanating from the strong field regime of super - massive black holes residing within the central core of galaxies .",
    "while the unperturbed kerr black hole ( bh ) does not radiate , compact objects that orbit and plunge into its horizon do stir up vibrations of spacetime that carry energy - momentum to infinity .",
    "there is some hope that , when the compact object is much less massive than the bh itself , this  extreme - mass - ratio - inspiral \" ( emri ) system can be tackled analytically by expanding in powers of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the compact body and bh masses . in the strong gravity region near the black hole horizon , and at least within the lorenz gauge condition , compact bodies exert a tail - induced self - force that needs to be modeled properly for gw detectors to successfully track emri systems over @xmath38 $ ] orbital cycles @xcite .",
    "additionally , gws from compact binary systems , modeled by the well - established weak field post - newtonian / minkowskian ( pn / pm ) framework , are also known to scatter off their own spacetime curvature and develop tails .",
    "therefore , in this new era of gw astronomy , the tail phenomenon in 4d curved spacetimes is no longer a mere intellectual curiosity ; but understanding it properly could lead to observable consequences . to this end , we hope it will prove instructive to first understand thoroughly the gravitational and electromagnetic green s functions in the simpler context of cosmology .",
    "it is worth pointing out that such an indirect detection of the tail effect  through its impact on the compact bodies dynamics , which in turn would alter the resulting emri / pn / pm gw - forms  is a test of our understanding of classical field theory in curved spacetime . for ,",
    "since the pioneering work of hadamard @xcite , it is known that green s functions in 4d curved spacetimes , at least whenever the observer at @xmath39 and the spacetime - point - source at @xmath40 can be joined by a unique geodesic , take the generic form @xmath41 = u[x , x ' ] \\delta_+[\\sigma_{x , x ' } ] + v[x , x ' ] \\theta_+[\\sigma_{x , x ' } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dirac @xmath42-function term describes the strictly - null signals and the ( step- ) @xmath43-function term the tail signals .",
    "( here , @xmath44 is proportional to the square of the geodesic distance between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . )",
    "the key insight is that : while understanding the tail function @xmath45 requires the full wave equation to be solved , the null - cone parts @xmath46 and @xmath47 only require the geodesics of the background spacetime to be known .",
    "this lends itself to the physical interpretation that classical wave tails arise from the long wavelength modes , because it is these low frequency waves that are sensitive to the background spacetime curvature .",
    "we begin , in ",
    ", with a review of and commentary on the extant literature on the gw memory effect in cosmology .",
    "following that , in  , we describe in detail the cosmological setup we are considering in this paper , including the background metric and fluid solutions upon which we are going to carry out perturbation theory .",
    "the technical core of the paper lies in  , where we will carry out first order gauge - invariant perturbation theory by first computing the equations - of - motion ( eom ) of the metric variables before presenting their analytic solutions in terms of convolution of appropriate green s functions against the astrophysical source .",
    "potential gw memory effects , in both the scalar and tensor sectors , will be pointed out . in  , we carry out an analogous gauge - invariant analysis for electromagnetic fields in cosmological spacetimes , and work out potential electric memory effects .",

    "the bulk of @xcite consisted of solving the linearized weyl tensor sourced by a null matter stress - energy tensor .",

    ", we shall examine the geodesic deviation equation that encodes the tidal forces exerted upon a gw detector . if @xmath890 is tangent to the timelike geodesic swept out by one component of lisa , for instance ; and @xmath58 is the vector joining it to a nearby component ; from eq .",
    ", @xmath891 if the riemann tensor were zero , @xmath58 is parallel transported along @xmath892 and there would be no tidal forces .",
    "it is convenient to work with the synchronous gauge metric in eq . , because it allows us to make the exact statement @xmath893 . by a direct calculation",
    ", one may then verify that this choice of gauge eliminates the @xmath894 component of eq . because both @xmath895 and @xmath896 are individually zero .    _ minkowski background _",
    "let us , for a start , assume the detector is operating nearly at rest in a background minkowski spacetime . since the background riemann tensor vanishes , its first order counterpart is gauge - invariant .",
    "in fact , the spatial components of the right hand side of eq . can be re - cast in terms of the gauge - invariant variables , @xmath897 where @xmath898 without the solutions to linearized general relativity at hand , one may be tempted to surmise that all scalar , vector and tensor perturbations produced by a distant astrophysical system contribute to the tidal squeezing and stretching of a gw detector .",
    "but if we do in fact assume general relativity holds , so that equations , , and through may be exploited , @xmath899 by referring to eq .",
    "we recognize the first line to contain various irreducible spatial components of the matter stress - energy tensor .",
    "if we assume the gw source is isolated and well separated from the observer , this first line vanishes identically at the gw detector s location . as for the second line , by recalling the  _ coulomb vs. waves _ \" discussion in  , we may estimate the scalar - to - tensor amplitude to scale as ( ( characteristic timescale of gw source)/(observer - source spatial distance))@xmath451 .",
    "hence , in the far zone where the gw detector is located , @xmath900 to reiterate : it is only after the dynamics of general relativity has been incorporated , eq .",
    "reduces to the statement that the acceleration of the deviation vector in spatial directions is driven primarily by the tensor mode filling the space around a distant gw detector .    _ cosmological background _ we move on to discuss the case where gws are journeying across a cosmological background",
    ". we shall invoke the form of the riemann tensor in eq .",
    ", and for technical simplicity focus only on the weyl contribution to tidal forces .",
    "now , the weyl tensor @xmath901 , with one upper index , is conformally invariant .",
    "that means , when linearized about a perturbed spatially flat flrw universe , it must be equal to its flat spacetime counterpart .",
    "moreover , since it vanishes about the background homogeneous and isotropic universe , the linearized weyl tensor @xmath902 must itself be gauge - invariant .",
    "a direct calculation then shows the components of weyl relevant for the @xmath299th component of the geodesic deviation eq .",
    "are @xmath903 where the first term ( from the left ) involves the scalar spacetime laplacian , @xmath904 .",
    "since @xmath905 actually equals its linearized counterpart about minkowski , all scale factors really cancel out . but",
    "putting the weyl tensor in this form allows the eom for @xmath53 , @xmath312 , @xmath311 and @xmath271  specifically , equations , , and  to be employed . if we further make the approximation that the gw experiment does not run over cosmological timescales , so that all the ensuing @xmath449 terms may be neglected , eq . could then be re - expressed as @xmath906 much like the minkowski case above , the first line vanishes identically at the gw - detector s location because it contains various @xmath135 components of the isolated astrophysical system .",
    "the subtlety in the cosmological case at hand arises on the second line : even though @xmath53 admits wave solutions and therefore always plays a key role in exerting tidal forces on the gw detector ; @xmath311 does so only when @xmath1 . for",
    ", it is within this range of eos that @xmath311 obeys a wave equation ( namely , eq . ) and the @xmath907s acting on it in eq .",
    "can be treated on roughly the same footing as the time derivative @xmath908(characteristic timescale of gw source ) .",
    "we close this section by suggesting that the ",
    "conformal fermi normal coordinates \" recently developed in dai , pajer and schmidt @xcite ( which built upon earlier work by pajer , schmidt and zaldarriaga @xcite ) for cosmological large scale structure applications , could perhaps also be used to integrate the geodesic deviation equation to study gw observables and potential memory effects in our universe .",
