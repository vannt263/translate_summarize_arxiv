    "flavor oscillations in dense neutrino gases exhibit collective phenomena caused by neutrino - neutrino interactions  @xcite . in the simplest example of a dense neutrino gas that is homogeneous and isotropic , studies of collective oscillations in the two - flavor context amount to solving the nonlinear equations of motion ( eoms ) for a set of flavor polarization vectors  @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 the `` effective magnetic field '' @xmath4 is a unit vector in flavor space and @xmath5 the vacuum oscillation frequency for a neutrino mode with energy @xmath6 .",
    "the total polarization vector of the ensemble  is @xmath7 finally , @xmath8 is a typical neutrino - neutrino interaction energy .",
    "its exact definition depends on how we normalize the polarization vectors , but for our purpose it is simply an adjustable parameter of dimension energy .",
    "two main questions are of interest : what are the collective forms of motion in a dense neutrino gas ? what happens when @xmath9 slowly decreases , mimicking the expanding universe or the neutrino density variation with distance from an astrophysical source ?",
    "we concentrate on the former question and identify a new mode of collective oscillations that so far has gone unnoticed .",
    "the simplest form of collective motion consists of `` synchronized oscillations , '' meaning that modes with different frequencies @xmath10 oscillate with a common frequency @xmath11 if @xmath9 is sufficiently large  @xcite .",
    "the main physical idea is that the hamiltonian vectors @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) are dominated by @xmath13 , forcing all @xmath1 to follow @xmath14 and thus to a common precession around  @xmath4 .",
    "it is this picture that we will see is not always complete .",
    "another case is the `` pure precession mode '' where each @xmath1 is collinear ( parallel or antiparallel ) to @xmath12 @xcite . even though @xmath12 depends on all @xmath1 through @xmath14 , such a self - consistent solution exists for any strength of @xmath9 .",
    "all @xmath12 lie in the plane spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath14 .",
    "this plane rotates around @xmath4 , all @xmath1 being static within it . for @xmath15",
    "this solution requires all @xmath1 to be collinear and then is identical with a synchronized solution .",
    "conversely , beginning with collinear @xmath1 and slowly reducing @xmath9 takes us adiabatically through different pure precession modes .",
    "finally , the `` pendulum in flavor space '' represents a class of solutions relevant for @xmath9 not too large  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case involves two vectors @xmath16 that initially point in opposite directions .",
    "the dynamics of this system is equivalent to a gyroscopic pendulum .",
    "once more , for @xmath15 the motion is a common synchronized precession without nutation unless initially @xmath17 .",
    "it was always assumed that , unless initially @xmath18 , the large-@xmath9 behavior is a synchronized precession .",
    "likewise , it was assumed that the pure precession mode is stable .",
    "however , while a small perturbation may lead to small oscillations around the ideal solution , it may also lead to an exponential deviation .",
    "numerical studies always found stable behavior for the pure precession mode and synchronized behavior in the large-@xmath9 limit .",
    "however , we will see that these findings depend on special choices of initial conditions and are not generic , although probably most relevant in the supernova context .",
    "it is easy to see that the pure precession mode and its large-@xmath9 limit need not be stable .",
    "a pure precession mode with each @xmath19 collinear with @xmath12 is a self - consistent exact solution .",
    "realistic initial conditions , however , begin with all @xmath1 collinear with each other , representing the assumption of all neutrinos being prepared in weak - interaction eigenstates . on the other hand , the initial",
    "@xmath9 may be large but must be finite .",
    "this initial condition is not an exact pure precession mode because each @xmath1 sports a small angle relative to its @xmath12 and thus moves on a precession cone with a small but nonzero opening angle .",
    "therefore the total @xmath14 itself can not be static in the co - rotating plane .",
    "each @xmath1 precesses around @xmath12 with an approximate frequency @xmath9 , so @xmath14 itself must `` vibrate '' with a similar frequency .",
    "we thus have a typical situation for a parametric resonance : each @xmath1 precesses around @xmath12 with the approximate frequency @xmath9 and @xmath12 itself vibrates with a similar frequency . therefore , while the precession cone of each @xmath1 follows its @xmath12 , it is not assured that the opening angle stays small .",
    "the exact outcome depends on how the evolution of the @xmath1 feeds back on @xmath14 and thus on @xmath12 .    to identify the simplest system showing such behavior we return to the eoms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) and note that they have two exact invariants .",
    "one is the angular momentum along @xmath4 , so @xmath20 is conserved  @xcite .",
    "the other is the energy  @xcite @xmath21 where the `` total magnetic moment '' is @xmath22 when @xmath15 energy conservation implies that @xmath23 and thus @xmath24 are conserved  @xcite . @xmath14 then precesses around @xmath4 as a collective object , representing the usual synchronized oscillations .",
    "this does not imply , however , that all @xmath1 remain collinear with @xmath14 .",
    "there can be internal motions among them such that @xmath24 is conserved and @xmath14 still precesses as a collective object , yet the individual @xmath1 move relative to each other and relative to @xmath14 .    for two polarization vectors",
    "no internal motion is possible without modifying @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath25 is conserved , the motion of each @xmath1 is described by two angles , so we have a total of four degrees of freedom . with two exact constants of the motion there",
    "remain two degrees of freedom , representing , for example , the `` nutation angle '' and the `` precession angle '' of the flavor pendulum .",
    "there is no room for new forms of motion .",
    "if we have three or more polarization vectors that are initially aligned , nothing new happens either because the approximate conservation of @xmath24 in the large-@xmath9 limit requires that the @xmath1 remain aligned .",
    "thus we need three polarization vectors ( oscillation frequencies @xmath26 ) , one of them initially anti - aligned with the others . if the `` flipped '' polarization vector is number 1 or 3 we are back to the flavor pendulum because in the large-@xmath9 limit two neighboring aligned vectors act roughly as one average mode .",
    "this is not possible if the flipped vector is number 2 , so the relevant initial configuration is either up - down - up or down - up - down .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the most basic system of this sort and some simple generalizations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] we solve analytically a very symmetric system consisting of three modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] we consider its counterpart for a continuous spectrum of modes and solve it analytically .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the basic configuration showing a self - induced parametric resonance consists of three polarization vectors with frequencies @xmath26 . for simplicity",
    "we assume equal frequency spacings @xmath27 .",
    "the common precession of the system around @xmath4 is irrelevant , so we can choose @xmath28 , essentially going to a rotating frame around @xmath4 .",
    "the polarization vectors are @xmath29 with oscillation frequencies @xmath30 and @xmath31 and",
    "the eoms are @xmath32 moreover , we assume that all polarization vectors have unit length and that initially @xmath33 point in the positive , @xmath34 in the negative @xmath35-direction .      .",
    "we show @xmath33 and @xmath34 , projected on the direction of the total @xmath14 .",
    "the uppermost curve is @xmath24 .",
    "[ fig : threea ] ]    we first illustrate the behavior of this system with a numerical example .",
    "we take @xmath4 to be tilted relative to the @xmath35-axis by an angle @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 itself playing the role of the neutrino mixing angle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : threea ] we show the evolution of the projections of @xmath33 and @xmath39 on @xmath14 for the interaction strength @xmath40 .",
    "the vector @xmath34 evolves from its initial anti - alignment with @xmath14 to complete alignment and back , and so forth periodically .",
    "the other two vectors evolve similar to each other such that @xmath20 is strictly conserved and the length @xmath24 ( uppermost curve ) is approximately conserved .    , now with a small mixing angle and @xmath41 ( upper panel ) and @xmath40 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the interaction energy ( see text).[fig : threeb ] ]    the interesting internal evolution is relative to @xmath14 , so a large @xmath38 complicates the system by projection effects .",
    "we may use the opposite extreme of a vanishing @xmath38 because the existence of the new collective mode can not depend on this choice .",
    "a vanishing @xmath38 has the only disadvantage that the system can not start moving if the polarization vectors begin exactly collinear with @xmath4 .",
    "however , the motion can be excited by using a small but nonzero @xmath38 or by some other disturbance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : threeb ] we show the evolution for an extremely small but nonzero mixing angle using @xmath42 ( upper panel ) and @xmath43 ( lower panel ) .",
    "we do not show the long quasi - static phase where the system starts moving .",
    "one difference to the previous case is the absence of any `` wiggles '' even for a moderate @xmath9 . for larger @xmath9",
    "the variation of the interaction energy @xmath44 becomes smaller .",
    "we show as a dotted line the quantity @xmath45 . for @xmath15",
    "the two energy components @xmath46 and @xmath47 seem to be separately conserved .",

    "if we use coordinates where the @xmath49-direction is defined by @xmath34 we can describe the motion by the angle @xmath48 alone in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this way we always have @xmath53 .",
    "the energy components @xmath46 and @xmath54 do not depend on  @xmath48 .    ]",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sol1 ] ) must be a good approximation to the solutions of the eoms , so all that is missing is the time evolution of @xmath48 . to find it we simplify the eoms further and",
    "observe that the component of @xmath14 along @xmath4 is strictly conserved .",
    "our choice of unit length for all vectors therefore implies @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath14 component transverse to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the eoms are @xmath57 we observe that there is a common precession with frequency @xmath9 around @xmath4 that represents the fast internal precession of all @xmath1 around @xmath14 .",
    "we can take out this common motion by going once more to a rotating frame so that finally the eoms for the internal motion are @xmath58 we have achieved that fast precessions that are common to all polarization vectors have disappeared .",
    "the polarization vectors see the usual @xmath4 , leading to normal precessions , and in addition a transverse effective field represented by @xmath56 that tilts them .",
    "this is analogous to the textbook example of magnetic resonance where an electron spin precesses fast in a strong external @xmath59 field . applying even the tiniest transverse @xmath59 field that rotates with the original precession frequency leads to a situation where in the co - rotating frame the spin only feels the transverse component and completely reverses relative to the direction of the large external field .    in this example",
    "the rotation speed of the transverse @xmath59 component must be adjusted to match the electron s precession frequency . in our case",
    "this resonance condition arises automatically by the nonlinear nature of the problem where the transverse field is provided by the precessing polarization vectors themselves .    to solve the eoms",
    "it is useful to introduce the difference vector @xmath60 and study the motion of the three vectors @xmath34 , @xmath61 and @xmath56 .",
    "their eoms are @xmath62 the vectors @xmath34 and @xmath61 have lengths of order unity , whereas in the large-@xmath9 limit @xmath56 must be small .",
    "energy conservation implies that it must be of order @xmath63 or smaller .",
    "however , since @xmath56 appears on both the l.h.s .  and r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom3c ] ) and since it appears multiplied with @xmath9 on the r.h.s .",
    ", both sides of this equation are of the same order in @xmath64 only if to leading order @xmath65 here we have assumed that to leading order @xmath61 has no component along @xmath4 because @xmath66 and @xmath67 are expected to behave symmetrically . inserting this into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom3a ] ) and  ( [ eq : eom3b ] ) and neglecting terms of order @xmath64 we find @xmath68 to leading order in @xmath64 we have found a closed system of eoms for @xmath34 and @xmath61 alone .",
    "the strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction has disappeared , only @xmath69 appears as an energy scale .    in our coordinate system @xmath34 moves in the @xmath49-@xmath35 plane whereas @xmath61 is along the @xmath70-direction . describing the orientation of @xmath34 with the angle @xmath48 as in eq .",

    "therefore , we have the eom of a pendulum with frequency  @xmath69",
    ".    the initial condition @xmath33 aligned with @xmath4 and @xmath76 anti - aligned corresponds to the initial condition @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in other words ,",
    "the pendulum begins in an inverted position and obeys @xmath79 this agrees well with numerical examples .    using the vectors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol1 ] ) with any value @xmath80 as an initial condition amounts to @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] or @xmath82^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the system follows the same solution ( up to corrections of order @xmath64 ) for any @xmath80 , except that the pendular motion begins in some phase of the oscillation other than the inverted position .",
    "the pendulum begins with an initial excursion @xmath80 and an initial velocity @xmath83 , both adjusted such that it will reach the inverted position .",
    "we can also choose other initial conditions with an arbitrary @xmath80 and no initial velocity ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "in this case we have a pendulum that oscillates between two maximal excursion angles without reaching the inverted position . in terms of the polarization vectors",
    "this corresponds to @xmath33 being initially aligned with @xmath85 whereas @xmath34 begins with a nonvanishing angle @xmath80 .",
    "we can choose this initial angle such that all three polarization vectors are initially almost aligned .",
    "in this case we obtain small - amplitude oscillations .",
    "this shows that our solution is also relevant for three initially aligned polarization vectors , the case where one finds synchronized oscillations . in the limit @xmath15 and exactly aligned vectors nothing happens",
    "however , for a finite @xmath9 and a small disturbance these vectors do oscillate . here",
    "the small opening angles of the precession cones caused by the imperfect initial alignment between @xmath1 and @xmath12 also cause a parametric resonance , but in the direction of the small opening angles becoming smaller , then back to the original angle , and so forth .",
    "so the parametric resonance always occurs , but has a visible effect only if @xmath34 is initially anti - aligned with @xmath33 .",
    "we finally remark that the initial orientation of the three polarization vectors relative to @xmath4 is irrelevant .",
    "the initial conditions up - down - up or down - up - down are equivalent .",
    "in contrast to the gyroscopic flavor pendulum the neutrino mass hierarchy is here irrelevant .",
    "we return to the case where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are initially at some large angle @xmath36 relative to @xmath4 , corresponding to a large neutrino mixing angle @xmath38 .",
    "armed with the insights gained in the previous section we note that we should study this situation in a coordinate system co - moving with @xmath14 and co - rotating with @xmath34 around @xmath14 .",
    "now the vector @xmath4 rotates with the large frequency @xmath9 around @xmath14 , its transverse component averaging to zero . in other words",
    ", we may consider the rotation - averaged eoms in the same spirit as for the ordinary matter effect  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the previous section remains unchanged except that only the component of @xmath4 along @xmath14 contributes .",
    "this amounts to using the effective oscillation frequency @xmath86 .",
    "one can verify in numerical examples that this is indeed what happens . even comparing our figs .",
    "[ fig : threea ] and  [ fig : threeb ] reveals to the naked eye that a large @xmath38 value increases the oscillation period .",
    "we conclude that the essential dynamics of our system does not depend on @xmath38 . for our theoretical study",
    "it is most convenient to use @xmath87 whereas in numerical examples one uses a nonvanishing value that provides the necessary initial disturbance to start the motion .",
    "ordinary matter has the same effect on all modes and therefore can be removed by going into a rotating frame  @xcite .",
    "since we anyway only study the internal motion of the @xmath1 and since we already go to a rotating frame to achieve this simplification , nothing new happens by the extra matter - induced rotation .",
    "therefore , the effects discussed here are not modified by the presence of dense matter except for details of the initial disturbance caused by the fast - rotating @xmath4 .",
    "antineutrinos are most easily included in the eoms as modes with negative frequencies @xmath88 @xcite , so in the most general case both neutrinos and antineutrinos are present .",
    "on the other hand , we constantly switch between rotating coordinate systems , shifting the zero - point of frequency at convenience .",
    "after each shift the behavior of the abstract system is the same , whereas its physical interpretation changes .",
    "the polarization vectors used here are similar to the neutrino flavor isospin vectors of duan et  al .",
    "@xcite in that for an antineutrino ( negative frequency ) `` spin up '' means @xmath89 if for a neutrino ( positive frequency ) `` spin up '' means @xmath90 .",
    "shifting between rotating coordinate systems therefore changes , for example , a @xmath89 to  a  @xmath90 .",
    "we repeat , however , that the interpretation of the polarization vectors is irrelevant with regard to the dynamics of the system .",
    "it is easiest to think of all modes as representing neutrinos in that any given distribution can be thought of as stemming from a neutrino distribution , suitably shifted to a rotating frame .",
    "therefore , in an abstract discussion of the eoms and their solutions , antineutrinos need not appear explicitly .",
    "we have studied a very symmetric system , but the general behavior persists if we vary the relative lengths of the vectors @xmath91 and the frequency splittings .",
    "however , for any motion of this sort to be possible the three vectors must be able to move relative to each other while conserving @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 is conserved , energy conservation implies that we also need to conserve  @xmath46 .",
    "once the lengths of the three vectors are specified , their motion is described by two angles each , so a total of six angles .",
    "our conditions provide four constraints , leaving two degrees of freedom : an irrelevant overall precession angle around @xmath14 and one angle describing the internal configuration .",
    "the general conditions for a solution are not particularly illuminating , but we remark that , if @xmath66 and @xmath67 have equal lengths , the parametric resonance requires @xmath92 .",
    "this is verified in numerical examples .",
    "the dashed line is the `` flipped '' version of the thick spectrum . [ fig : resonance ] ]    next we consider a broad spectrum of modes .",
    "for convenience we scale all frequencies with a scale @xmath69 and use @xmath93 as a time coordinate , i.e. , we use dimensionless frequencies . without loss of generality",
    "we consider the range @xmath94 .",
    "we study the continuous generalization of the previous three - vector example , using an initial spectrum that is of box shape and has a flipped part in the middle ( shaded spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] ) .",
    "we let this ensemble evolve with a fixed large  @xmath9 , using a @xmath4 that is collinear with the polarization vectors except for a small mixing angle that triggers the motion .",
    "all modes oscillate with the same phase and reach their maximum excursion at the same time .",
    "we show the maximum excursion spectrum as a thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] .",
    "the result is clearer when we `` flip '' the central part of the spectrum ( dashed line ) . within numerical accuracy ,",
    "this compound curve is a lorentzian resonance curve .",
    "therefore , the different parts of the neutrino spectrum librate relative to each other .",
    "in particular , the neutrinos with intermediate frequencies oscillate completely between two flavors with a typical vacuum oscillation frequency .",
    "the neutrino density does not enter as long as it is large in the sense @xmath95 .",
    "we can make the `` flipped '' part of the spectrum narrower , obtaining a narrower lorentzian .",
    "however , we can not make it arbitrarily broad in the same way as in the three - vector example the middle vector could not be longer than twice the length of the peripheral vectors .",
    "here we find that the width of the flipped part must not exceed half the total box width .",
    "the transition is sharp in the sense that if the flipped part is slightly broader than half the total , nothing happens , if it is slightly smaller we find complete reversals and back of the central part of the spectrum .      to determine the exact solution in the large-@xmath9 limit we note that the eoms in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom5 ] ) are @xmath96 where each polarization vector is characterized by its frequency @xmath97 .",
    "we have assumed again that the mixing angle is small and therefore @xmath4 collinear with @xmath98 .",
    "integrating both sides over @xmath99 leads to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is here not assumed to equal unity .",
    "the `` magnetic moment '' is @xmath102 .",
    "the same argument as in the three - vector example implies @xmath103 to lowest order in @xmath104 .",
    "we use spectra that are symmetric relative to @xmath105 so that @xmath106 to lowest order has no component along @xmath4 .",
    "so the eoms are @xmath107 once more we have eliminated the large frequency @xmath9 .    in this form",
    "it is clear that we expect a resonance shape of the oscillation pattern as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "only the mode with @xmath105 is exactly on resonance in that the transverse @xmath59 field ( here @xmath106 ) is exactly co - rotating with it , or in our co - rotating coordinate system , does not move at all .",
    "the other modes precess around @xmath4 relative to the @xmath106 direction .",
    "they are not exactly on resonance .    for an explicit example we return to a box spectrum like fig .",

    "( [ eq : eom10 ] ) .",
    "the behavior found in the previous section is similar for less symmetric arrangements .",
    "however , the `` flipped '' part of the spectrum must not be too broad and must not get too close to the edges of the overall box .",
    "in other words , the two `` wings '' of the spectrum must be large enough to support the parametric resonance , but we have not worked out the general condition .    the crucial feature is to have a `` double - crossed '' spectrum @xmath127 , representing the initial @xmath35-component of @xmath128",
    ". the spectrum must first cross from positive to negative and then back to positive values or the other way round .",
    "one can also construct multiple - crossed spectra and finds more complicated parametric resonance patterns .    on the other hand",

    "@xmath133 is maximal , so moving any polarization vector makes it smaller .",
    "this is easily seen if we go to a rotating frame where @xmath134 .",

    "the opposite is true if the spectrum crosses from positive to negative values or if we take @xmath4 to point in the negative @xmath35-direction .",
    "in other words , even though for a single - crossed spectrum one could move the polarization vectors such that @xmath139 and @xmath47 remain unchanged , the quantity @xmath133 is extremal .",
    "a single - crossed spectrum is the prototype for a gyroscopic flavor pendulum that is driven by the exchange of energy between @xmath47 ( playing the role of kinetic energy ) and @xmath133 ( potential energy ) . in the large-@xmath9",

    "we have shown that in a dense neutrino gas , neutrino - neutrino interactions can lead to a parametric resonance that causes different parts of the flavor spectrum to oscillate relative to each other .",
    "this effect persists in the large - density limit where one would have expected synchronized oscillations .",
    "the new pattern is an internal motion among the ensemble of polarization vectors that still precess together as a collective object , but do not retain a common orientation relative to each other .",
    "the strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction does not appear in the oscillation frequency that is determined entirely by the spectrum of vacuum oscillation frequencies .    however , the parametric resonance has a macroscopic impact only if the initial flavor spectrum @xmath127 is at least `` double crossed '' in that there must be a spectral flavor sequence of the form up - down - up or the other way round .",
    "we use polarization vectors similar to `` neutrino flavor isospin vectors '' where , for example , a @xmath140 mode is `` spin down '' if @xmath90 is defined as `` spin  up . ''",
    "therefore , a neutrino flux initially consisting of neutrinos and antineutrinos of a single flavor represents a single - crossed case : @xmath127 changes sign once at @xmath105 going from antineutrinos to neutrinos .",
    "most numerical studies of supernova neutrino oscillations used such single - crossed spectra and the parametric resonance did not show up .    a dense gas of neutrinos and antineutrinos of different flavors in kinetic ( but not chemical ) equilibrium is also single crossed .",
    "for a fermi - dirac distribution the spectral shape and amplitude are fixed by the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "if the distributions for two flavors are described by the same @xmath146 but different degeneracy parameters , they do not cross .",
    "our spectrum @xmath127 with @xmath147 represents the difference between the distributions of the two flavors because the identical parts drop out of the oscillation equations .",
    "the only crossing occurs at @xmath105 at the spectral junction between antineutrinos and neutrinos .",
    "flavor - dependent neutrino chemical potentials are important inside a supernova core and also in the early universe if primordial neutrino asymmetries exist .",
    "the usual picture of synchronized oscillations and/or a synchronized msw resonance remains unchanged . in this context the parametric resonance apparently does not lead to a novel speed  up of flavor conversions .",
    "neutrinos streaming from a supernova core are not black - body radiation . even if one approximates the fluxes of @xmath90 , @xmath140 and the other species by fermi - dirac distributions , the effective temperatures and chemical potentials are different .",
    "typically one finds three spectral crossings , the usual one at @xmath105 and one for a negative and one for a positive @xmath97 , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . however , neutrinos streaming from a source are strongly anisotropic , so the parametric resonance would be suppressed by multi - angle effects as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : multiangle ] even if the spectral conditions were appropriate .",
    "therefore , it is unclear if the collective motion represented by the parametric resonance is realized in any practical astrophysical or cosmological context .",
    "perhaps the main insight is that even for a slowly changing or fixed @xmath9 the individual polarization vectors @xmath1 need not follow their `` single - particle hamiltonians '' @xmath12 even if the system as a whole evolves adiabatically .    in the supernova context one",
    "is primarily concerned with the fate of flavor - dependent neutrino spectra as a function of radius , the decreasing neutrino - neutrino interaction producing a `` spectral split . '' in the homogeneous and isotropic model represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) this occurs if @xmath9 slowly decreases so that @xmath12 changes from being @xmath148dominated to being @xmath149dominated . for a single - crossed spectrum",
    "the occurrence of a split is explained by each @xmath1 following its @xmath12 in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the spectral split occurs at a frequency @xmath150 corresponding to the final co - rotation frequency .",
    "its value can be found from the conservation of @xmath20 . in the present case of a double - crossed spectrum a slowly decreasing @xmath9",
    "leads to two spectral splits .",
    "multiple - crossed spectra lead to multiple spectral splits .",
    "the occurrence of multiple splits is not directly accounted for by the picture of all @xmath1 following their @xmath12 in a single co - rotating frame and a full theoretical understanding of the phenomenon of multiple spectral splits is presently missing .",
    "the parametric resonance and multiple splits are not directly related even though this investigation was motivated by the numerical observation of multiple splits .",
    "a parametric resonance for our box - spectrum requires the flipped middle part not to exceed half the box width whereas a double split occurs for any width of the flipped part .",
    "it is actually surprising that the large-@xmath9 oscillations have no apparent impact on the final sharp double  split that is found in the adiabatic limit of a slowly decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "one also finds that multiple splits are not , or at least not always , prevented by multi - angle effects for neutrinos streaming from a source . on the other hand ,",
    "the collective motion found here is `` fragile '' and easily suppressed by multi - angle effects as explained earlier .",
    "perhaps the main lesson from our investigation is that the innocent - looking eoms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) continue to surprise us with unexpected solutions , even if these solutions need not be of direct astrophysical relevance .",
    "much of the insights gained about collective neutrino oscillations are owed to `` numerical experiments '' followed in some cases by theoretical explanations and even analytic solutions .",
    "one may well worry if our current understanding of these nonlinear equations is sufficiently advanced to arrive at robust conclusions about possible observable effects for example in supernova neutrino spectra .",
    "more theoretical work may well turn up more surprises .",
