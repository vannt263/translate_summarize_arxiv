    "understanding and minimization of background plays a very important role in rare decay studies like double beta decay ( dbd ) . for such rare processes ( t@xmath310@xmath4 years ) ,",

    "t@xmath6 @xmath11  years , etc . ) , setup materials and the detector itself are the source of @xmath13 and neutrons .",
    "further , muon - induced interactions in the materials surrounding the detector give rise to additional background of @xmath14-rays and neutrons . while it is impossible to completely eliminate these background sources , it is essential to minimize the same .",
    "the flux of cosmic ray muons can be significantly reduced in an underground laboratory .",
    "background from internal sources can be minimized by careful selection of radio pure materials  @xcite , while the background from the external sources is reduced by suitable shielding . in recent experiments ,",
    "ultra low levels of background @xmath1510@xmath16 cts/(kev kg year ) have been claimed using special materials and novel techniques @xcite .",
    "the total background , both from external and internal sources , has to be taken into consideration during the interpretation of results .",
    "generally , a background model employing monte carlo ( mc ) simulations taking into account all the contributions from the actual setup and the environment in the experimental site is used for physics analysis @xcite .    to assess the level of radio purity in the materials surrounding the detector , samples are often counted in a close geometry to obtain high counting efficiency . for accurate determination of radio impurities , precise knowledge of detection efficiency over a wide energy range",
    "is necessary .",
    "the efficiency measurement in a close geometry is complicated using standard multi - gamma sources due to coincidence summing effects .",
    "hence , measurements are restricted to available mono - energetic sources in a limited energy range .",
    "consequently , mc simulation technique is adopted to obtain efficiency of the detector over a wide energy range for different source - detector configurations .",
    "it has been observed in the literature @xcite that the efficiency computed from the mc simulations using the detector geometry supplied by the manufacturer is overestimated ( by @xmath1710@xmath1 ) as compared to the experimental values .",
    "the discrepancy in efficiency is attributed to the inaccuracy of the supplied parameters , like detector size and the dead layer .",
    "it should be mentioned that this effect is more pronounced for large size detectors @xcite , which may be due to incomplete charge collection .",
    "thus , the parameters of the detector need to be optimized by detailed measurements along the detector surfaces covering the energy range of interest .",
    "in addition , measurements at different distance for various source geometries are required to extract the active volume .    a feasibility study to search for 0@xmath18 in @xmath2sn using a tin cryogenic bolometer",

    "a low background counting setup with hpge detector has been made at sea level in tifr , mumbai .",
    "this setup is intended for screening of materials in the prototype bolometer r@xmath21d at tifr as well as for understanding the background .",
    "in addition , the setup will be used for rare event studies like dbd to the excited states of daughter nuclei , rare alpha decays etc .",
    "this paper describes the optimization of the hpge detector model using mc simulations . in the present work ,",
    "mono - energetic sources are used to scan the ge crystal in directions parallel and perpendicular to its cylindrical axis .",
    "measurements are also done with sources over an energy range of e@xmath22=100 - 1500  kev as a function of distance to estimate its active volume .",
    "experimental details are discussed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the procedure of mc simulations as well as the optimization of different parameters of the crystal , namely , the top and side dead layer , front gap , radius , length and hole size .",
    "results of the detector model and measurements in the low background counting setup are presented in section 4 and conclusions are given in section 5 .",

    "figure  [ sketch]a shows a schematic view of the experimental setup together with the inner 5  cm low activity ofhc cu shield and the outer 10  cm low activity pb shield ( @xmath230.3  bq / kg @xmath24 ) . figure  [ sketch]b shows the cross - sectional view of the detector indicating different parameters .",
    "the detector bias used is + 4  kv , as recommended by the manufacturer .",
    "the nominal size of the ge crystal given by the manufacturer is 78.3  mm diameter and 63  mm length with a 0.7  mm dead layer on the cylindrical side .",
    "in addition to electrical contacts , the detector is surrounded by aluminized mylar and thin copper on sides as well as on bottom for thermal shielding .",
    "generally , the physical dimensions of the detector can be determined by radiography @xcite but the active volume of the detector may differ depending on the electric field configuration inside the crystal @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of photopeak efficiencies using radioactive sources give better estimates on the actual active volume and the surrounding materials of the detector . in the present case ,",
    "radiography of the setup was not possible and hence mono - energetic sources covering an energy range of 59.51115.5  kev were used to scan the crystal .",
