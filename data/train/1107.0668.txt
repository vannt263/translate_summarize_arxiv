    "the issue of thermalization is a very challenging question in the theory of heavy ion collisions . on the one hand",
    ", a lot of circumstantial evidence suggests that the matter formed in these collisions behaves like a nearly perfect fluid at very short times after the collision ( this is based on a comparison of flow measurements with predictions of hydrodynamical models ",
    "see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "this fact is commonly interpreted as a sign of the fast thermalization of the quark - gluon matter produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions . on the other hand , justifying this thermalization from first principles in qcd has proven to be very difficult , and to this date the question has not been satisfactorily answered .    the main issue is the following : a semi - hard momentum scale the saturation momentum @xmath0 is dynamically generated by the non - linear gluon interactions that occur in nuclear collisions at high energy @xcite .",
    "this scale controls the so - called gluon saturation phenomenon , that alters the gluonic content of a nucleus at high energy , but it is also this scale that controls the final state interactions that occur after the collision , at least initially .",
    "however , the saturation scale @xmath0 increases with the energy of the collision , and therefore the relevant qcd coupling effectively decreases .",
    "it thus seems that the relevant degrees of freedom are rather weakly coupled in collisions at very high energies , rendering difficult the obtention of short thermalization times @xcite .    to compute the initial gluon production in heavy ion collisions at high energy",
    ", we have at our disposal an effective theory the color glass condensate @xcite that consistently takes into account the non - linear saturation effects . in this effective theory , the degrees of freedom that populate the light - cone wave - function of a nucleus are divided in two classes , according to their longitudinal momentum .",
    "partons with a longitudinal momentum above a certain cutoff @xmath1 are approximated by a collection of static ( because they appear highly boosted in the frame of the slower partons ) color sources of density @xmath2 , while the partons with longitudinal momentum below @xmath1 are treated as standard gauge fields @xmath3 . in this effective theory , the sources @xmath4 are stochastic variables ( reflecting the fact that we do not know the precise arrangement of the fast partons at the time of the collision ) , with a probability distribution @xmath5 $ ] .    from the above description of the cgc , it may seem that observables could depend on the unphysical cutoff @xmath1 , that has been introduced by hand as a separation scale between the fast and the slow partons .",
    "this worry becomes manifest when one computes loop corrections in this framework : they usually contain logarithms of the cutoff @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately , one can show that for sufficiently inclusive observables in the collision of two nuclei , these logarithms are universal in the following sense : ( i ) they do not depend on the observable under consideration , but are instead properties of the initial state , and ( ii ) each logarithm of @xmath1 can be assigned to one of the two projectiles ( meaning that its coefficient does not depend on the nature of the second projectile ) .",
    "this universality allows to absorb all these logarithms into a redefinition of the distributions @xmath5 $ ] of the two projectiles .",
    "after this is done , these distributions depend on the cutoff @xmath1 ( in such a way as to cancel the @xmath1 dependence that arises from loop corrections ) , and their changes under variations of the cutoff are controlled by the jimwlk evolution equation @xcite .",
    "the color glass condensate , supplemented with the jimwlk equation , therefore provides a consistent framework for computing observables relevant to heavy ion collisions , such as the spectrum @xcite of produced gluons or components of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "however , these computations have also shown that the gluonic matter produced in these collisions is rather far from local equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in fact , its pressure tensor is highly anisotropic , with two positive transverse pressures and a negative longitudinal pressure .",
    "such a form of the pressure tensor is arguably too far from the equilibrium form to justify the applicability of hydrodynamics ( even with viscous corrections ) .",
    "this computation , a leading order calculation in @xmath6 improved by the resummation of all the leading logarithmic contributions discussed above , is however not the end of the story .",
    "it has been noted in various situations @xcite that the classical solutions of yang - mills equations that constitute the lo answer in the cgc approach are unstable under small perturbations .",
    "practically , this means that loop corrections contain secular divergences i.e .",
    "terms that have an unbounded growth with time and that the perturbative expansion breaks down after a certain time ( this time can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath7 , up to logarithms ) .",
    "an additional resummation is therefore necessary in order to circumvent this problem and to obtain expressions that remain well behaved at all times .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the nlo ( 1-loop ) corrections to inclusive observables in the cgc formalism suggests a natural resummation scheme , that in a loose sense amounts to exponentiating the 1-loop result .",
    "such a resummation first appeared in the context of inflation in cosmology @xcite . in the context of the color glass condensate and heavy ion collisions",
    ", it was sketched in @xcite in the case of gauge fields , and more thoroughly justified in the case of scalar fields in @xcite .",
    "the reason why a @xmath8 scalar field theory in four dimensions is an interesting playground for testing these ideas is that this theory , like yang - mills theory at the classical level , is scale invariant , and that its classical field configurations are also subject to an instability ( due to parametric resonance ) .",
    "the resummation we advocated in @xcite can be formulated in two equivalent ways : its derivation leads first to a rather formal expression , in which the resummation is expressed as the action of the exponential of a certain operator on the lo result .",
    "this form is not practical for a numerical implementation , but is equivalent to averaging the lo order result ( which is expressed in terms of a classical field ) over a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions for the classical field .",
    "we then showed that the proposed resummation indeed leads to observables that remain finite at all times , therefore solving the original problem of secular divergences .",
    "moreover , by studying the time evolution of the pressure tensor , we showed that after the resummation , the pressure converges towards its equilibrium value in a fairly short time something that would not happen with the unresummed expression .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue the study of this system of scalar fields , in order to elucidate the microscopic state of the system .",
    "in particular , we would like to know whether the system is thermalized when its pressure has relaxed to its equilibrium value , or whether on the contrary one could have an equilibrium - like pressure tensor while the system is still far from equilibrium . a natural quantity to study in order to address",
    "this question is the occupation number in the system , and its time evolution .",
    "however , even before computing the occupation number , it is interesting to ask whether the system can be described in terms of quasi - particles ( this is not trivial : although the system is weakly coupled , it is also very dense , and strong collective effects may render the quasi - particles completely unstable ) .",
    "we start with a reminder of the model and of the main results of @xcite in the section [ sec : setup ] ; then we compute in the section [ sec : toy : spectral ] the spectral density of the system , after having justified that it can be resummed in the same way as the energy - momentum tensor . in the section",
    "[ sec : occ ] , we continue our study with the occupation number . we compute it as a function of momentum up to large times , and identify several stages in its time evolution .",
    "in particular , we discuss the possible occurrence of turbulence and bose - einstein condensation . from the occupation number ,",
    "we perform in the section [ sec : qp - mass ] several tests of the quasi - particle picture ( e.g. compare the measured mass of the quasi - particles , with its value at 1-loop , including medium effects ) and compute how the entropy of the system evolves with time .",
    "a summary and further discussion can be found in the section [ sec : t - evol ] . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : classical ] , we discuss some aspects of the classical dynamical system to which the quantum field theory is equivalent in our resummation scheme",
    ". some basic properties of the liouville equation are recalled in the appendix [ app : liouville ] .",
    "in @xcite , we considered a real scalar field theory , with quartic self - interactions , and coupled to an external source .",
    "the lagrangian of this model reads @xmath9 in this model , the source @xmath10 is nonzero only at negative times , and its purpose is to initialize the fields to a configuration that has a large expectation value at @xmath11 . at positive times , @xmath12 and the fields",
    "evolve by themselves .    in @xcite",
    ", we have studied the time evolution of the energy - momentum tensor of the system . at leading order ( tree level ) in the coupling @xmath13 ,",
    "it is simply the energy - momentum tensor of a classical field : @xmath14\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\square \\varphi + \\frac{g^2}{3!}\\varphi^3&=&j\\ ; , \\quad   \\lim_{x^0\\to -\\infty}\\varphi(x^0,\\x)=0\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : lo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , at nlo ( 1 loop ) we observed that @xmath15 is plagued by secular divergences that originate from an instability of the above classical solution , due to parametric resonance . in order to cure this problem",

    "the main result of @xcite is that the fluctuations resummed in the formula ( [ eq : sum1 ] ) , in addition to making the resummed quantities free of secular divergences , cause the pressure to relax towards its equilibrium value ( one third of the energy density for a @xmath8 theory in four dimensions ) . without these fluctuations ,",
    "the pressure is simply that of a classical field configuration , and it oscillates periodically around the equilibrium value , but never relaxes : therefore there is no one - to - one relationship between the pressure and the energy density , and thus no equation of state at lo .",
    "the fluctuations of the initial condition for the classical field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum1 ] ) produce a decoherence that dampens the oscillations of the pressure , as illustrated in the figure [ fig : eos ] , and after a finite time the pressure converges towards the value required by the equilibrium equation of state ( @xmath37 ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "we have also studied the fluctuations of the energy in a small subsystem .",
    "of course , the total energy in the system is conserved and therefore does not fluctuate , but its value in a small subvolume can vary due to exchanges with the surroundings .",
    "we have observed a rapid transition from rather narrow gaussian fluctuations at the starting time to broader fluctuations that are much closer in shape to canonical equilibrium fluctuations at late times .",
    "this transition appears to occurs approximately at the same time as the relaxation of the pressure .",
    "however , the study performed in @xcite does not tell us much about the microscopic evolution of the system : indeed , since the energy density and the pressure of the system are intensive quantities that sum over all the modes of the system , the existence of an equation of state identical to the equilibrium one does not imply that the system is in full equilibrium .",
    "equilibrium requires a much more stringent microscopic arrangement of the system , in which the energy is distributed among the various modes in a very specific way . in the present paper",
    ", we wish to pursue this study by looking at more microscopic aspects of the system : namely the existence of quasi - particle excitations , and the evolution in time of their momentum distribution . in particular",
    ", we would like to know how the energy of the system , initially introduced in the zero mode via a spatially homogeneous external source , eventually goes into higher momentum modes .",
    "a crucial ingredient in this process is the parametric resonance that exists in the @xmath8 scalar field theory , and therefore it is important that the ultraviolet lattice cutoff be large enough to comprise the resonance band .",
    "if the source @xmath10 is parametrically @xmath38 then the resonance band is located at momenta of order @xmath39 , and the uv cutoff @xmath1 must therefore obey @xmath40 .",
    "setting up the lattice cutoff in this way is sufficient to study the evolution of the system at short times , because on these time scales the occupation number remains small above the resonance region , as we shall see later in this paper .",
    "this is however not sufficient if we want to study the approach of the system to thermal equilibrium . in order to see this ,",
    "recall that the energy density in the system is parametrically @xmath41 if thermal equilibrium is achieved , this energy density must also be given by the stefan - boltzmann formula ( at least for reasonably weak couplings ) , @xmath42 which tells us that the system would equilibrate at a temperature @xmath43 for a numerical simulation to be able to approach the equilibrium state , the lattice ultraviolet cutoff must be large enough to include modes of the order of the temperature , which is a more stringent constraint than simply having the resonance band below the cutoff . at weak coupling , this implies that the resonance band should be located towards the soft sector of the lattice spectrum , i.e. in a region where the lattice mode density is rather low . in order to still have a significant number of lattice modes inside the resonance band",
    ", we used a larger lattice ( of size @xmath44 for the results presented in this paper ) , and we have chosen the value of the parameter @xmath45 so that the resonance band is located near @xmath46 ( in lattice units , where the ultraviolet cutoff is at @xmath47 ) .",
    "this choice of @xmath45 is significantly lower than the value used in @xcite ( where we were only interested in the early stages of the time evolution , dominated by the resonant modes ) .",
    "this means a lower energy density , and larger time scales . indeed , since our system is scale invariant , energy density scales like @xmath48 and all the times scale like @xmath49 .",
    "the resulting time evolution of the pressure , for this choice of @xmath45 and a coupling constant @xmath50 , is shown in the figure [ fig : eos ] .",
    "before we study the time evolution of the occupation number in the system , it is interesting to ask an even more elementary question : can the system be described in terms of quasi - particles , or on the contrary does it interact so strongly that no identifiable quasi - particles show up in its spectrum ? to that effect , one can compute the spectral function , defined as the imaginary part of the fourier transform of the retarded propagator does not depend on @xmath51 . ] : @xmath52 in this formula , the retarded propagator is normalized so that @xmath53\\,g_{_r}(x , y)=\\delta(x - y)\\ ] ] for a classical field configuration @xmath26 .",
    "a system in equilibrium is invariant under translations in time , and therefore its spectral function defined in this way is in fact independent of the time @xmath54 .",
    "however , for transient systems that are not yet in equilibrium , the spectral function will evolve with time and the @xmath54 dependence is important .",

    "the simplest way to compute this propagator is to consider a small field perturbation @xmath22 in that background , that obeys the following equation of motion @xmath57\\,a(x)=0\\ ; .",

    "there , besides the main branch that continues to large @xmath82 , the spectral density exhibits additional branches .",
    "one of them corresponds to a higher mass excitation , and another one has a mass comparable to the main branch but an anomalous dispersion such that the frequency decreases while the momentum increases .",

    "if one takes as a crude estimate the hard thermal loop @xcite expression of the medium - generated mass  ( see for instance @xcite , pp 4145 ) , @xmath92 as a function of the occupation number @xmath93 , we can interpret the decrease of the mass as a shift of the occupation number from low @xmath82 to higher @xmath82 s if the total number of quasiparticles ( @xmath94 ) is approximately constant .",

    "the increase of the non - zero modes is most pronounced in a narrow band of @xmath124 , where it peaks more than an order of magnitude above the rest of the curve .",
    "one can check that this band of @xmath124 coincides with the band of parametric resonance that we have discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the dominant physics at early times is that of resonance , which leads to a quick increase of the occupation number in a narrow region of @xmath82 .",
    "after @xmath125 , the resonance peak has disappeared and the evolution becomes fairly slow .",
    "let us now discuss fits of the occupation number , that are represented in the figure [ fig : fk ] .",
    "the first two are a fit by a bose - einstein distribution , @xmath126 and a fit by a classical distribution of the form @xmath127 interestingly , the best fit we could achieve with a bose - einstein distribution required a non - zero chemical potential .",
    "although the particle number has no reason to be conserved in this theory ( there is no symmetry protecting it ) , this suggests that changes of the particle number are slow compared to the evolution of the distribution in momentum space : a chemical potential at the latest times we have considered indicates that the particle number has not yet reached its equilibrium value ( and its positive sign means that we have a particle excess ) .    at weak coupling ,",
    "this is rather natural : inelastic processes have a much smaller rate than the elastic ones scalar theory that we consider here , @xmath128 , while @xmath129 .",
    "the hierarchy between the elastic and inelastic time - scales is certainly less pronounced in qcd ( see @xcite ) and there it is unclear whether there is enough time for the formation of a transient state that has a non - zero chemical potential . ] , and therefore at intermediate time scales the number of particles is an approximately conserved quantity . in order to check this hypothesis",
    ", we can evaluate the number density by summing the occupation number over all the modes @xmath82 .",
    "this has been done in the figure [ fig : density ] .",
    "one sees indeed that , after a period of somewhat erratic evolution ( that roughly corresponds to the time necessary to have well defined quasi - particles in the system ) , the number density decreases very slowly at late times , as a small negative power of time .",
    "it is also obvious from the figure [ fig : fk ] that a bose - einstein distribution does not fit well the occupation number in the tail at large @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , the contrary would have been surprising , since our computation is essentially semi - classical .",
    "naively , one may expect to obtain a classical distribution of the form @xmath130 ( again , a non - zero @xmath131 is allowed if number changing processes are very slow ) , but one can check that such a distribution does not produce a better fit of the tail . at first sight , one could be tempted to blame this drop in the tail on the rarefaction of the lattice modes at large @xmath124 ( see for instance the figure 15 in @xcite ) . however , this assumption does not hold if one does the same simulation with lower physical scales , as is done in the figure [ fig : fk_small ] . on this figure , one sees the same drop , now occurring at a smaller value of @xmath124 .",
    "if the drop was caused by lattice artifacts , one would expect it to occur at a fixed value of @xmath124 ( in lattice units ) , no matter what the physical scales are .",
    "it turns out that this drop has a rather trivial explanation .",
    "firstly , note that a very good fit is obtained with the distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) ( the thin black line in the figures [ fig : fk ] and [ fig : fk_small ] ) , that differs from the naive classical distribution by an extra @xmath132 term . this extra term , that makes the fit considerably better , has a simple origin : it comes from the @xmath132 in the equation ( [ eq : fk ] ) , which in the derivation of the formula for @xmath93 can be traced back to the non - zero commutator between creation and annihilation operators .",
    "keeping this @xmath132 correction in the definition of the occupation number for a semi - classical calculation is to a large extent an arbitrary choice .",
    "indeed , such an approximation is expected to reproduce correctly the underlying quantum theory only in the region where the occupation number is sufficiently large .",
    "when this is the case , one has @xmath133 , and therefore this @xmath73 is not very significant .",
    "this also means that the drop of the occupation number at @xmath134 in the figure [ fig : fk ] , although perfectly understandable in our semi - classical approximation , is obviously not a physical feature of the underlying quantum theory term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) is nothing but the second term in the expansion of the bose - einstein distribution in powers of @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , at a formal level , keeping this @xmath73 correction in the present semi - classical computation gives a better approximation of the full quantum theory .",
    "this point was already discussed extensively in @xcite in the context of the boltzmann equation . ] . in our setup , there is one advantage in keeping the @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fk ] ) though : if one does the same computation with a vanishing source @xmath12 , one gets identically @xmath136 , which is of course the exact answer . without this @xmath132",
    ", one would have obtained @xmath137 .      at @xmath138 ,",
    "the modes in the resonance band reach their maximal occupancy , and start to subside afterwards , while the other non - zero modes continue to increase .",
    "while the resonance peak progressively disappears , one sees in the figure [ fig : fk ] that the occupation curves tend to accumulate in the intermediate @xmath124 range on a fixed line that is well fitted by a power law @xmath139 . in this regime",
    ", the zero mode continues to decrease , while the occupation curve extends slowly into the hard region .",
    "such a scaling with an exponent @xmath140 in the power law is well know in the physics of turbulence ( see the first part of @xcite for instance ) .",
    "typically , in kolmogorov s turbulence , the energy cascades to the hard modes from a source localized in the soft sector , with an intermediate stationary distribution in between , that follows a power law @xmath139 . in our case",
    ", the zero mode plays the role of this source , since it was initially the only occupied mode .",
    "in contrast to the usual setup in the study of kolmogorov s turbulence @xcite , our system is closed and eventually the zero mode will run out of energy and will not be able to feed the cascade anymore .",
    "however , in our simulation , we have not reached the time at which this starts to happen .      in the figure [ fig : fk ]",
    ", we saw that the occupation number at late times is best fitted by a distribution of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) .",
    "this fit however calls for two comments :    * the occupation number of the zero mode lies above the curve provided by this fit , * the best value of the chemical potential ( @xmath141 ) is close to the mass of the quasi - particles at this time , @xmath142 .",
    "these two seemingly unrelated facts have a common interpretation .",
    "as we have seen before , a chemical potential arises because the number of quasi - particles evolves very slowly in this system , and a positive @xmath131 is the reaction of the system to accommodate an excess of particles .",
    "however , it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bemu ] ) and ( [ eq : class ] ) that @xmath131 can not be larger than the mass @xmath89  otherwise , the occupation number would become negative near @xmath143 . but having an upper bound on the chemical potential implies an upper bound on the particle density that these distributions can describe .",
    "what if the particle excess in the system is so large that the density is larger than this upper bound ?",
    "when this happens , the excess of particles condenses on the zero mode , a phenomenon known as bose - einstein condensation .",
    "dynamically , the system evolves towards a distribution made of two components .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in the appendix [ sec : classical ] . ] , @xmath144 i.e. the chemical potential settles to the maximal value @xmath145 , and the extra particles go into the zero mode is the only mode where the extra particles can go .",
    "if the particles in excess occupy non - zero modes , then one does not have a fixed point of the boltzmann equation . ]",
    "as one can see from the fit of the figure [ fig : fk ] , the occupation number at low @xmath82 appears to be precisely of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bemu+cond ] ) .    from the knowledge of the occupation number , it is easy to compute what fraction of the number of particles and what fraction of the total energy",
    "are contained in the zero mode at various times .",
    "this information is provided in the two plots of the figure [ fig : efrac ] .    at early times ( up to @xmath147 ) , all the particles and all the energy are stored in the zero mode , as a consequence of our initial condition . at intermediate times ( e.g. at @xmath148 ) , a large fraction of the energy is still in the zero mode , and the remainder is almost entirely in the resonance band . at the latest time we have considered ( @xmath149 lattice units ) , the zero mode still contains about @xmath150 of the particles and @xmath151 of the energy .    on could argue that our computation does not demonstrate bose - einstein condensation , because we started from an initial condition in which all the energy is already stored in the zero mode .",
    "what if we had started from a situation where the zero mode is empty ? we have done that in the figure [ fig : fk_cond_k1 ] , in which the energy of the system is initially contained in the modes @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( the total energy being exactly the same as in the figure [ fig : fk ] ) .",
    "thus , at the initial time , the occupation number has a delta peak at a single , non - zero , energy .",
    "but then , one sees that a non - zero occupation number develops in the zero mode ( and in other modes as well ) , to reach very large values in a rather short time . after this rapid transient regime",
    ", all trace of the original peak has been washed out . at late times , the distribution has become identical to the one encountered in the figure [ fig : fk ] : all the modes except @xmath146 are described by a function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) , and there is a particle excess in the zero mode .",
    "this study strongly suggests that bose - einstein condensation indeed occurs in this system term at the origin or whether it is a strongly peaked but otherwise regular function .",
    "] , when it is initially over - occupied .",
    "from the occupation number , we can further test the quasi - particle description of the system .",
    "a simple check is to compute the medium - induced mass of the quasi - particles , assuming that perturbation theory applies .",
    "the hard thermal loop contribution to this mass has already been given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermal - mass ] ) , and we have represented this quantity in the figure [ fig : mass ] ( blue curve ) , along with the mass obtained by fitting the location of the peak in the spectral function . in the region where quasi - particles are well defined ( @xmath154 ) , we see that the htl value of the mass is systematically lower than the observed one .",
    "we can improve this result by including also the 1-loop vacuum contribution to the mass . at 1-loop in a @xmath8 theory , this is given by a tadpole graph whose expression can be written as @xmath155 including the vacuum contribution to the mass improves significantly ( see the red curve in the figure [ fig : mass ] ) the agreement between the theoretical prediction and the fit , indicating that higher - order corrections are presumably rather small for this value of the coupling ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the quasi - particle description is quite consistent : indeed , the occupation number computed from the fields themselves , when inserted into the 1-loop formula for the effective mass , reproduces very well the mass measured by fitting the peak in the spectral function .",
    "a quasi - particle description of a system is useful only if the residual interactions between the quasi - particles are weak  in other words , if the main effect of the interactions is simply to alter the properties of the particles ( e.g. by generating an effective mass ) .",
    "this can be tested by computing the energy density of the system by summing the energies of its quasi - particles , i.e. by assuming that they have no residual interactions is equivalent to substituting the expectation value of the interaction energy @xmath156 by @xmath157 , i.e. to a mean - field approximation .",
    "] , @xmath158 by comparing this quasi - particle energy to the actual energy density , @xmath159 , we can estimate the interaction energy of the quasi - particles and therefore the strength of their residual interactions .",
    "the result of this comparison is shown in the figure [ fig : energy-1 ] .",
    "we see that the true energy of the system is always below the energy of its quasi - particles , indicating that the residual interactions are attractive  which is indeed a standard result of a @xmath8 field theory .",
    "moreover , as the time increases , the energy of the quasi - particles gets closer to the true energy , meaning that the quasi - particle description is better at late times .      from the occupation number ,",

    ", we have displayed the entropy that would have a gas of free bosons of equal energy density at thermal equilibrium .",
    "the true entropy of the system gets close to the equilibrium entropy , but not exactly equal even at the largest times we have considered ( the discrepancy remains of the order of @xmath161 ) .",

    "the increase of the entropy defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) may seem paradoxical at first sight , given the way it has been obtained in our framework .",

    "this equation of motion is invariant under time reversal @xmath162 , yet the entropy @xmath163 computed in this system is clearly not invariant under this transformation  despite the fact that it is a functional of classical fields that have a time - reversible evolution .",

    "this means that , if one were able to determine the field configuration of the system at a given time , there would be no entropy increase because everything would be known about the microscopic state of the system .",
    "in contrast , the definition ( [ eq : entropy ] ) is the appropriate definition when one knows only the single particle distribution in the system . compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy-1 ] ) , a lot of information about the microscopic state of the system has been discarded by doing this .",
    "this coarse graining is the reason why the entropy given by ( [ eq : entropy ] ) increases with time , while at the microscopic level the field configurations evolve via time reversible equations .",
    "in this paper , we have pursued the study started in @xcite of the time evolution of a system of scalar fields in a fixed volume box , in a resummation scheme that has been devised to cure the problem of secular divergences caused by parametric resonance .",
    "although it is a resummation of quantum corrections that arise via loops , we have shown that this resummation can also be formulated as an average over classical field trajectories , with a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "this latter formulation is the one we adopt for a practical numerical implementation . in @xcite , we have focused mostly on the evolution of the energy - momentum tensor of the system , and we have shown that the pressure relaxes towards its equilibrium value , thanks to a decoherence mechanism due to the fluctuating initial conditions .    in the present paper , we have studied more microscopic properties of the system , in order to understand in more detail its time evolution . in particular , one question that was left unanswered in @xcite is whether the system is in local thermal equilibrium at the time its pressure tensor reaches the equilibrium form .",
    "first of all , we have studied the existence of quasi - particles in the spectrum of the theory , by computing the spectral function of the system .",
    "next , after having identified quasi - particle modes , we have computed their occupation number and the associated entropy .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of this paper in a synthetic way , by displaying in parallel the time evolutions of the various quantities that we have considered separately so far .",
    "this is shown in the figure [ fig : summary ] .    from these plots",
    ", it appears that one can divide the time evolution in three stages that are qualitatively distinct .",
    "moreover , these time - scales depend on the coupling constant @xmath13 , and decrease as the coupling increases . ] :    * @xmath167  :   at these early times , the pressure of the system has not yet started to relax towards its equilibrium value @xmath168",
    ". moreover , quasi - particles are not a good description of the system ( their mass is not well defined , and there are extra spurious branches in the spectral function ) .",
    "the entropy displays only a very moderate growth during this era , the occupation number starts rising in the resonance band almost immediately , but the energy is still almost entirely contained in the zero mode , * @xmath169  :   this intermediate period starts when the occupancy in the resonance band reaches its maximum and starts to subside , while the occupation number rises in the other momentum modes . during this stage ,",
    "the zero mode still contains the largest share of the total energy , and the remainder is contained predominantly in the resonant modes .",
    "the mains features of this era are the relaxation of the pressure towards its equilibrium value , and an important growth of the entropy . in this era , there are well defined quasi - particles , with a mass that is almost constant in time , * @xmath170  :   in the late stages of the time evolution , the pressure is the equilibrium one , and the entropy displays only a marginal growth .",
    "however , the system is not yet fully equilibrated : the mass of the quasi - particles shows a clear decrease , while the occupation number continues to slowly expand towards higher momenta . during this stage",
    ", the occupation number shows some signs of kolmogorov scaling , but perhaps even more compelling is the fact that it seems to evolve as would a system dominated by elastic collisions and which is overpopulated compared to equilibrium ",
    "i.e. by developing a chemical potential equal to the mass and a bose condensate at zero momentum .",
    "at the same time , the energy initially contained in the zero mode is progressively distributed among the higher modes .",
    "a very interesting observation is the appearance of a chemical potential , that we interpreted as resulting from a particle excess ( compared to the value the particle density should have in equilibrium ) combined to a fairly slow rate of inelastic processes .",
    "eventually , the inelastic processes will wipe out the initial particle excess .",
    "however , because they are slow , there is an extended regime where the occupation number settles on a form that has a chemical potential .",
    "moreover , for the bosonic statistics , the chemical potential can not be larger than the mass of the quasi - particles .",
    "this implies that if the particle excess is too large , it can not be accommodated solely by a chemical potential and the system stabilizes itself by the formation of a condensate at zero momentum .",
    "our numerical results confirm this , and moreover indicate that this condensation occurs very early in the time evolution .",
    "interestingly , the condition of overpopulation is also realized for the gluons produced initially in heavy ion collisions .",
    "indeed , at a time @xmath7 ( where @xmath0 is the saturation momentum ) , the energy density is @xmath171 and the gluon number density is @xmath172 .",
    "thus one has the dimensionless ratio @xmath173 , that should be of order 1 in chemical equilibrium .",
    "depending on the strength of the number - changing processes , one may also expect the ( transient ) appearance of a gluonic chemical potential and the formation of a gluon condensate at zero momentum .",
    "one of the virtues of the formalism we have developed to address this problem is its seamless integration into the color glass condensate framework , since it is formulated in terms of classical field configurations ( in fact , the resummation scheme we are using here was obtained as a by - product of the formalism developed for proving the initial state factorization of the large logs of @xmath174 ) . as a consequence",
    ", it can be adapted very easily to the yang - mills case , and to the study of thermalization in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "a crucial step in view of this application was performed in @xcite , where has been derived the spectrum of fluctuations at early times ( i.e. before the glasma instabilities start to develop ) for gauge field fluctuations  in a system of coordinates and a gauge that are appropriate for numerical studies of the evolution of the glasma fields .",
    "let us finally mention some possible connections with the idea of `` eigenstate thermalization '' proposed by srednicki in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this idea follows berry s conjecture  @xcite , which states that the high energy eigenstates of quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic have extremely complicated wave - functions that for all practical purposes can be replaced by a random sum of plane waves ( with gaussian distributed coefficients ) .",
    "assuming that this conjecture is satisfied , srednicki proved that sufficiently inclusive measurements on such a state would lead to results that agree with thermal equilibrium . the main impediment to thermalization in a quantum system",
    "would thus be the fact that the system is usually not prepared in an energy eigenstate .",
    "for instance , for a system that is initially in a coherent state , thermal features would only become manifest once the various energy eigenstates superimposed in the coherent state have become incoherent . in the problem we have considered in the present paper and in @xcite ,",
    "the initial condition at @xmath11 appears to be closely related to the wigner distribution of a coherent state and the associated classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "moreover , we have seen that the relaxation of the pressure is due to the loss of coherence between the various initial conditions .",
    "it would thus be very interesting to study whether there is a deeper connection between thermalization in quantum field theory and the ideas advocated by srednicki .",
    "we would like to thank j.p .",
    "blaizot , k. dusling , k. fukushima , y. hatta , k. itakura , j. liao , l. mclerran and r. venugopalan for useful discussions on the issues studied in this paper and on closely related questions .",
    "in the figure [ fig : fk ] , we have obtained a very good fit of the occupation number at late times by a function of the form @xmath175 this fit works except for the zero mode , that is over occupied with respect to this distribution .",
    "we interpreted this distribution as the classical approximation of a bose - einstein distribution , and the @xmath132 term was simply due to our definition of the occupation number .",

    "this reformulation is equivalent to solving the liouville equation , @xmath176 given some gaussian initial distribution .",
    "therefore , if we adopt this point of view , we just have a ( large ) collection of coupled classical oscillators , and we follow their hamiltonian flow in phase - space . in this appendix , we discuss some aspects of this classical dynamical system , that are relevant to the topics discussed in the rest of the paper .      motivated by the observation of quasi - particles in the system , we may assume that there is a transformation of the fields and their conjugate momenta such that the hamiltonian becomes a sum of quasi - free harmonic oscillators coupled only by weak residual interactions .",

    "simultaneously , the zero mode distribution shrinks slowly , while remaining on a curve of constant energy ( i.e. this seemingly constant energy is in fact slowly decreasing , due to a transfer of energy from the soft to the hard modes ) .    to summarize these observations , the fourier modes that initially have a large amplitude quickly decohere .",
    "if there are many such modes ( instead of only one as in our numerical example ) , what happens then depends on whether the classical dynamics is chaotic or on the contrary integrable : in a chaotic system , all these modes mix and fill uniformly an energy shell , while in the integrable case these modes would evolve independently and cover an invariant torus of much smaller dimension ( for @xmath190 modes , an energy shell is a manifold of dimension @xmath191 , while an invariant torus has dimension @xmath190 only ) . on larger time scales ,",
    "the energy carried by these initially large modes decreases slowly , and is transferred to the higher modes whose distribution expands as a consequence of this transfer .",

    "thus , if the residual interactions are weak , this quantity should indeed be approximately conserved .",
    "if both @xmath197 and @xmath205 are invariants , then the most general asymptotic solution of the liouville equation must depend on @xmath193 only through some combination of the form @xmath206 . for any distribution of this",

    "however , it may happen that the initial value of @xmath211 is larger than this maximum .",
    "in this situation , the @xmath184 s must be altered in order to accommodate this excess , but in such a way that eq .",

    "any modification of @xmath184 for @xmath212 will violate eq .",

    "then , we see that the only way to change @xmath213 without violating eq .",

    "thus , when there is an excess of @xmath211 , the equilibrium value of @xmath196 takes the form @xmath214 this explains why we found a chemical potential whose value is very close to the mass of the quasi - particles ( within statistical errors ) . this phenomenon can be seen as an analogue in classical hamiltonian dynamics of bose condensation in quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact that the liouville evolution makes the distribution @xmath215 evolve towards a classical thermal equilibrium leads to an interesting question : does the same happen if in our original problem there is no source coupled to the quantum fields , i.e. for pure vacuum fluctuations ?",

    "the consistency of our approach requires that the vacuum does not change over time .",
    "however , since eq .",

    "we have computed @xmath196 numerically for the pure vacuum case , by starting from the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vac - fluct ] ) and by evolving the corresponding classical field configurations also to a large time @xmath218 . as",
    "shown in the figure [ fig : edist_vac ] , this computation shows no sign of equipartition of the vacuum energy , indicating that the vacuum is stable in our framework .",

    "( [ eq : vac - fluct ] ) represents the ground state of the corresponding quantum theory ? in a sense , the liouville equation seems to know more than what its `` classical '' qualifier might suggest .",
    "this result can be qualitatively explained by recalling a formal connection that exists between quantum mechanics and the classical liouville equation . in quantum mechanics ,",

    "to do this , one should first introduce the wigner distribution associated to the density operator @xmath219 . for a single degree of freedom , this is defined as @xmath221 the von neumann equation can then be shown to be equivalent to the moyal equation for @xmath222 , @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the moyal bracket , obtained as the wigner transform of the commutator . at this stage ,",
    "one has a formulation of quantum mechanics that involves only quantities defined on the classical phase - space ( the quantum mechanical aspects are hidden in the fact that the moyal bracket depends on @xmath225 ) .",
    "the connection to the classical liouville equation arises via the following two properties ,    * the moyal bracket @xmath226 is equal to the poisson bracket @xmath227 if the hamiltonian @xmath228 is quadratic in the coordinates and momenta , * for any hamiltonian , one has @xmath229    if the quantum system is in its ground state @xmath230 , its density operator @xmath231 is invariant under the von neumann equation .",
    "equivalently , the corresponding wigner distribution @xmath232 is invariant under the moyal equation .",
    "since @xmath233 is the wigner distribution of the same vacuum state , it is thus natural that it is left invariant by the liouville evolution , since it is the @xmath234 limit of the invariant moyal evolution .",
    "in this appendix , we recall the derivation of liouville s equation and some of its well known properties .      in this appendix , we denote generically the canonical coordinates by @xmath235 , the corresponding canonical momenta by @xmath236 , and the hamiltonian by @xmath197 .",
    "hamilton s equations read @xmath237 let us introduce a few useful notations  : @xmath238 hamilton s equations can now be rewritten in the following compact form @xmath239 this notation is suggestive of the fact that @xmath240 is the velocity field induced on phase - space by the hamiltonian .",
    "a crucial property of hamiltonian flows is that they are incompressible , @xmath241 this identity is the essence of liouville s equation .",
    "consider an ensemble of such dynamical systems , all described by the same hamiltonian @xmath197 . at the time @xmath242 , their distribution in phase - space is described by a density @xmath243 $ ] , and we wish to derive an equation that describes the time evolution of this distribution .",
    "naturally , the number of systems in the ensemble is not changing since each system evolves independently of the others .",
