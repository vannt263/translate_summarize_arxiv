    "the latest tpcf results continue to draw a distinction between the ly@xmath10 -only ( i.e. , apparently metal - free ) absorbers and those which also contain metals ( e.g. , 1548 ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the metal - line systems show a significant excess power in the tpcf at low velocity differences , the ly@xmath10 -only absorbers show very little evidence for clustering in velocity ( i.e. , only a 3-@xmath12 excess at @xmath13  km  s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , metals may be present in a substantial fraction of the still lower column density systems .",
    "these tpcf and metal abundance results suggest , but do not prove , that even the uniformly - distributed , lower column density ly@xmath10 absorbers could contain metals at a level of 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath17 solar .",
    "if this inference is correct , a very early epoch of star formation may have `` enriched '' the intergalactic medium ( igm ) more or less uniformly ( but see @xcite for evidence against this conclusion ) .    at the highest hydrogen column densities ( @xmath18 @xmath2 ) the association between galaxies and absorbers is much clearer .",
    "imaging and spectroscopy of strong metal - line systems at moderate @xmath8 @xcite have found strong evidence for the association of metal - bearing absorbers with luminous galaxies brighter than @xmath19l@xmath20 . in steidel s ( 1995 , 1998 )",

    "since the high equivalent - width systems are invariably optically - thick at the lyman limit , these systems must include both lyman limit and damped ly@xmath10 absorption systems .",
    "the two absorbers in the @xcite sample lacking `` associated '' bright galaxies are damped systems @xcite and it is now known that some low-@xmath8 damped ly@xmath10 absorbers are associated with dwarf @xcite and even low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies @xcite . a new blind 21 cm survey",
    "@xcite confirms that a very broad range of masses and thus optical and near - ir luminosity galaxies contribute to the damped ly@xmath10 absorber population @xcite .",
    "these observations are strongly suggestive that strong /lyman limit absorbers are due to metal - rich gas in bound halos of brighter galaxies ( @xmath22l@xmath20 ) , while damped absorbers are due to metal - rich gas in disks of galaxies of all descriptions and luminosities .",
    "weaker ( n@xmath23 @xmath2 ) low - ionization , ( , ) and high - ionization ( , , and ) metal - line absorbers are more numerous and poorly understood ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "particularly enigmatic are the low ionization , weak systems @xcite .",
    "while there is little imaging and spectroscopy of these systems that might reveal `` associated '' galaxies , a photoionization model leads to surprisingly high densities and thus small sizes ( @xmath24 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at least along the line - of - sight .",
    "suggestions concerning the enigmatic nature of these very numerous , low - ionization absorbers include extragalactic starforming regions , cool clumps in bound galaxy halos similar to galactic high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , and cool clumps in unbound galaxy winds .",
    "regardless , if the extremely small inferred cloud depths are indicative of the overall sizes of these weak systems , they would be extremely numerous ( greatly exceeding the number of bright galaxies ) and difficult to understand in any context @xcite .    _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) ultraviolet spectroscopy stands to make an essential contribution to our understanding of the relationship between galaxies and the variety of absorbers described above , because some of the hst - discovered absorbers are at sufficiently low redshift that their surroundings can be scrutinized for galaxies in great detail .",
    "statistical evidence for the relationship between low-@xmath8 absorbers and galaxies is based upon two major hst spectroscopic surveys : ( 1 ) the hst qso absorption line key project @xcite used the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) to study high column density ( log n@xmath25 @xmath2 ) absorbers and ( 2 ) papers  i - iv used the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) to study lower column densities ( log n@xmath26 to 16 @xmath2 ) but over a shorter pathlength ( @xmath27 compared to @xmath28 at @xmath29 for the key project spectroscopy ) .",

    "these latter results have suggested to some investigators ( including the current authors ) , that the proximity of high column density absorbers found by @xcite is not a cause - effect relationship between the absorber and its nearest galaxy , but rather is caused by both galaxies and absorbers being parts of the same large - scale structure filament .",
    "this conclusion is supported both by the theoretical n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and by the nearest neighbor analysis of paper  iii .    in an effort to utilize the most nearby ly@xmath10 absorbers to study the absorber / galaxy relationship ,",

    "this one absorption system has more column than all of the other ly@xmath10 absorptions along this sightline , so it is at the very high end of the column density distribution of absorbers studied by our hst and galaxy surveys ( papers  i - iv ) .",
    "this absorber is very similar to the `` weak '' absorbers studied by @xcite , as described above .",
    "t2002 use photoionization models to infer a cloud thickness of 70 pc , quite comparable to the small line - of - sight extents inferred by @xcite for weak systems .",
    "thus , this absorber and its possibly related galaxy allow us to study weak metal - line absorption systems in close detail . in the next section",

    "the 3c273 sightline was the first to have intergalactic ly@xmath10 absorption detected locally using hst @xcite .",

    "however , a subsequent far - uv spectrum of 3c  273 taken with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) detected 2 and 6 higher - order lyman lines respectively in these two systems , requiring a substantial downwards revision in the @xmath44-values to 32 and 16  km  s@xmath4  , respectively .",
    "the revised column density for the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber is now : log n@xmath45 @xmath2 .",
    "a subsequent stis echelle spectrum obtained by the stis instrument team @xcite detected low - ionization metal species in the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber ( c  ii 1335 , s  ii 1250  and si  1206 ) and placed sensitive limits on the presence of higher ions , specifically .",
    "in addition , we have used an archival ghrs medium resolution spectrum to place a limit on the presence of 2798 , 2803  in this absorber of @xmath46 m  ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "a photo - ionization analysis of this absorber by t2002 requires a surprisingly high density of @xmath47 @xmath48 , assuming a standard value for the extragalactic ionizing flux at @xmath49 of @xmath50 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath2 hz@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a metallicity of 6%  solar and an overabundance of silicon relative to carbon of @xmath51 dex was found , which is strongly suggestive of supernova type ii enrichment of this gas .",
    "this led t2002 to speculate that this absorber was recently enriched by an outflowing supernova - driven wind .",
    "the low metallicity suggests either that the galaxy creating the wind has overall low metallicity or the wind has swept up a large amount of metal - poor gas .",
    "another bright qso , rx j1230.8 + 0115 , is 0.9 degrees away from 3c  273 on the sky ( 355h@xmath21 kpc at 1586  km  s@xmath4 ) and also has hst uv spectroscopy available from ghrs and stis observations ( paper  i and * ? ? ?",
    "there is a particularly strong ly@xmath10 absorption line at 1666  km  s@xmath4  with an equivalent width of 389 m , which is almost certainly a blend of two absorbers , both with log n@xmath52 @xmath2 given the detection of close pairs of metal lines for a variety of species and ions @xcite . in these cases , the line ratios demand a photoionization model , which also leads to small line - of - sight depths through these clouds of @xmath53 kpc .",
    "the metal abundance of these clouds is consistent with being similar to the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber in 3c  273 , but with large error bars due to a poorly determined hydrogen column density .",
    "the velocity difference between these two absorbers and the 1586  km  s@xmath4  3c  273 absorber is small enough to suggest that these two absorbers are part of the same structure , which would then be inferred to be @xmath54h@xmath21 kpc across the sky @xcite .",
    "however , the coincidence of line pairs in velocity ( @xmath55  km  s@xmath4 ) in qso spectra can be interpreted either as a physically `` contiguous '' structure or a series of `` correlated '' structures stretching across these sightlines ; e.g. , metal enriched gas from galaxies aligned along the same large - scale structure filament . in this case `` correlated '' structures are suggested by the much smaller line - of - sight sizes of these two clouds . that is",
    ", the 1666  km  s@xmath4  absorbers in the rx j1230.8 + 0115  sightline could be two other small clouds similar to the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber studied here , but due to another galaxy aligned along the same large - scale structure filament .",
    "the first systematic attempt to discover galaxies associated with the ly@xmath10 absorbers towards 3c  273 was conducted by m93 , who used deep narrow - band and broad - band imaging in an attempt to detect faint galaxies which might be associated with ly@xmath10 clouds .",
    "they then performed followup multiobject spectroscopy on a `` complete sample of galaxies to @xmath56 '' over an area extending one degree from the qso in right ascension and 40 arcmin in declination .",
    "this corresponds to distances across the sky of @xmath57 and 260h@xmath21 kpc respectively at the distance to the absorbers in question .",
    "although the galaxy studied herein is within this sky area and brighter than 19th magnitude , it was not observed by m93 because its image was classified as `` merged '' ( s. morris , private communication ) .",
    "m93 found that , while the 3c  273 absorbers tended to be associated with groups or large - scale structures of galaxies , the ly@xmath10 absorbers did not cluster with galaxies nearly as strongly as galaxies clustered with each other .",
    "the m93 results are consistent with results obtained by other workers using other sightlines ( paper  iii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : there is no close relationship between galaxies and low column density ly@xmath10 absorbers .",
    "m93 did not find any new galaxies close to either one of the two virgo cluster absorbers .",
    "a summary of all known galaxies near these virgo absorbers is given in table 4 and figure 7 of paper  iii .",
    "for the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber there is no previously - known galaxy closer than 250 kpc with @xmath58  km  s@xmath4  , to which the absorber could be individually related .",
    "paper  iii suggested an alternative model which includes all 7 virgo ly@xmath10 absorbers ( 2 in 3c  273 and 5 in rx j1230.8 + 0115 ) and all 8 known galaxies in this region in a single large - scale structure , which stretches diagonally across these two sightlines for @xmath59h@xmath21 mpc . including the dwarf we report on here , and a new galaxy discovered recently by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , there are now 6 known galaxies at @xmath60  km  s@xmath4  within 1h@xmath21 mpc of the 3c  273 sightline .",
    "the presence of strong absorption systems in these two adjacent sightlines at nearly equal velocity , and containing gas of similar metallicity , is evidence in favor of a `` large - scale structure '' model for these absorbers .",
    "over the past several years we have conducted a deep galaxy redshift survey in regions where low-@xmath8 ly@xmath10 absorbers have been discovered with hst .",
    "we have used the dupont 2.6 m telescope of the las campanas observatory ( lco ) in chile and the 3.5 m wiyn telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in arizona .",
    "the lco observations were taken with the wide field ccd multiobject metal slit mask spectrometer ( @xmath61 for 4000 - 8000 ) designed and built by one of us ( rjw ) . a preliminary discussion of the observing setups , data reduction and analysis of both the lco and wiyn data can be found in @xcite",
    ". a more complete discussion of all sightlines observed will be presented later @xcite .    here",
    "we present a summary of the results for the 3c  273 sightline , in which spectra for 79 galaxies were obtained using lco slit masks , only 15 of which had previously been observed by m93 .",
    "our spectra of the 15 galaxies previously observed have confirmed the redshifts determined by m93 in all cases . of the remaining 64 , all but 6 were too faint to be selected by m93 .",
    "therefore , these new observations extend those of m93 1.5 to 2 magnitudes fainter within 15 arcmin of the sightline .    we are confident now that all galaxies with m@xmath62 and @xmath63 mag arcsec@xmath16 within 40 arcmin of 3c  273 have had redshifts determined .",
    "our confidence is based primarily upon the work of m93 and our realization that the small incompleteness of the m93 survey was due to a few misclassifications , which have now been rectified ; i.e. , all objects in this region have been classified by three different automated classification schemes ( we have used both the sextractor @xcite and ppp @xcite image classification algorithms ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitude completeness limit of m@xmath62 corresponds to m@xmath64 and -12.0 for the more distant and closer 3c  273 virgo absorbers respectively .",
    "our new survey has extended the m93 work to include @xmath65 of all galaxies with m@xmath66 within 15 arcmin of this sightline .",
    "thus , this field has been extremely well - surveyed for galaxies to limits comparable to local group dwarf spheroidals , and only one galaxy has been found close to the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber .",
    "this galaxy is shown in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf ] ; it is a dwarf with m@xmath67 lying 11 arcmin from the quasar sightline . at the hubble flow distance to this galaxy",
    ", it has a total absolute magnitude , m@xmath68 ( 0.004l@xmath20 ) , and its angular separation from 3c  273 amounts to a projected distance from the sightline to the galaxy of only 71 h@xmath5 kpc .",
    "this is the smallest impact parameter found in our entire survey .",
    "this galaxy was observed in two of the las campanas masks , as well as in a followup , long - slit spectrum obtained at the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) .",
    "the dis spectrum has a spectral resolution of @xmath69   ( 500  km  s@xmath4 ) covering the range 3600 - 9600  .",
    "the final redshift we adopt is based upon the 3.5 m spectrum because our best lco spectrum suffers from interference with zero redshift night sky absorption , since it was taken at quarter moon .",
    "the velocity obtained from the apo spectrum agrees for the various absorption lines measured to within @xmath70  km  s@xmath4  .",
    "the velocity determined for the galaxy is @xmath71  km  s@xmath4  ( heliocentric ) .",
    "a redshift determined from the better of the two lco spectra is 80  km  s@xmath4  less than the above value .",
    "therefore , the measured radial velocity of this galaxy overlaps the absorber velocity at the @xmath72 level .",
    "the better of the lco spectra is shown in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum can be described as a `` post - starburst '' or @xmath73 galaxy in that both absorption lines of an older or cooler stellar population and hydrogen absorption lines indicating a young , a - f star population are present .",
    "no emission lines are visible in the spectrum to a limit of @xmath74  , including [ oiii ] and h@xmath10 ( although not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c273_dwarf_spectrum ] , the wavelength of h@xmath10 is present in all three of our spectra ) . based upon deep b and r - band images of this galaxy ( see inset to figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf ] ) obtained at the apo 3.5 m telescope using the ccd imager `` spicam '' , this galaxy has a central surface brightness of @xmath75 mag arcsec@xmath16 , a disk scale length of 0.4h@xmath5 kpc , an overall color of ( b  r)=1.3 and isophotes of ellipticity 0.35 with little isophotal irregularities ( no significant ellipticity changes or isophotal twists ) .",
    "the seeing during these observations was 1.4 arcsecs .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_surf ] , the overall surface brightness brightness profile is much better fit with an exponential disk model than with an r@xmath76-law .",
    "thus , despite its elliptical appearance in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf ] , this galaxy is a spiral , and therefore , similar to local group dwarf spheroidals in their surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , this object s structural parameters fit nicely onto the dwarf spheroidal structural sequences shown in @xcite and far from the elliptical galaxy sequences . placing the core radius that we have measured for this galaxy on the dwarf spheroidal sequences in @xcite suggests a velocity dispersion of @xmath53  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , our lco and apo spectra were obtained at too low a spectral resolution to confirm this estimate .",
    "the evidence that this spiral has been entirely stripped of its gas and dust includes the absence of patchy absorption in the b - band image , the absence of 21 cm emission ( m@xmath77 m@xmath78 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the absence of h@xmath10 and [ o ii ] line emission ( table [ tbl - lick ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with its classification as an @xmath73 galaxy . given its distance and apparent magnitude , the galaxy is a dwarf with an extrapolated total magnitude of m@xmath68 .",
    "post - starburst or @xmath73 galaxies are quite rare in the local universe .",
    "@xcite found that only a very small percentage of galaxies in a large field galaxy survey could be described as `` post - starburst '' : 0.2% .",
    "however , in a more recent spectroscopic survey of the outskirts of several nearby very rich galaxy clusters , @xcite found that 3 - 12% of all cluster ellipticals exhibit post - starburst spectra , although these statistics refer to galaxies considerably brighter than the one we have found here .",
    "while virgo is much less rich than the clusters studied by these authors , we might expect that a few percent of all early - type galaxies in the southern virgo region would be post - starburst .",
    "thus , an admittedly _ a posteriori _ probability that a post - starburst galaxy is the nearest galaxy to this absorber just by chance is @xmath79 .",
    "another _ a posteriori _ probability that supports a physical / causal relationship between this dwarf galaxy and the absorber is that , given that only 6 galaxies total are found in the m93 and current galaxy survey areas within @xmath80  km  s@xmath4  of the absorber , the probability that one of these would be found @xmath81 kpc from 3c  273 accidentally is @xmath82 .",
    "so , even if the galaxy filament in this region of sky spans a velocity range of @xmath83  km  s@xmath4 , the likelihood is small that a galaxy in this filament would be found just by chance as close to 3c  273 as this dwarf .    the next nearest galaxies to the 3c  273 absorber are ugc 7642 ( @xmath84  km  s@xmath4  and m@xmath85 ) , a starforming dwarf irregular which is 252h@xmath5 kpc away on the sky and ugc 7612 ( @xmath86  km  s@xmath4  and m@xmath87 ) , an lsb dwarf sm galaxy , which is 265h@xmath5 kpc away on the sky .",
    "although these galaxies are @xmath88 times more luminous than the dwarf we have found , they are also much farther away from the sightline . indeed ,",
    "as we show below , these galaxies have properties which , we believe , that this newly discovered dwarf had several gyrs ago . there are three other galaxies at comparable recession velocities 483 , 743 and 791h@xmath5 kpc away , so there is some evidence for a filament of galaxies in this region at the absorber redshift .",
    "so , given that the next two nearest galaxies are at comparable distance from the absorber and that there is some evidence for a galaxy filament ( see paper iii ) , the two alternative hypotheses for the origin of the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber are either that it is primarily due to the dwarf we have found or that it is due to the cumulative effect of several nearby galaxies in this filament , including this dwarf    the apo 3.5 m spectrum allows further investigation into the nature of the stellar population(s ) in this dwarf .",
    "the equivalent widths and line strengths for some of the `` lick indices '' @xcite are shown in table [ tbl - lick ] .",
    "we also list upper limits on the equivalent widths of the h@xmath10 , [ o ii ] 3727 , and [ oiii ] 5007  emission lines .",
    "although figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_spectrum ] does not show the h@xmath10 region , each of our three spectra covered that region and h@xmath10 was not detected in any of our data to sensitive limits .",
    "however , h@xmath10 does appear to be detected in absorption in our spectrum with equivalent width of @xmath89  , so some weak emission may be present which fills in some of the h@xmath10 absorption line .",
    "the strength of h@xmath90 ( 2  ) is large enough to suggest that a single , massive starburst created the f stars which are seen in hydrogen absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , an h@xmath90 equivalent width of this strength may also be produced from a more extended star formation history ( see particularly figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* , based upon 10@xmath91 galaxies from the sdss )",
    ". therefore , while suggestive of a massive starburst , the lick indices in table [ tbl - lick ] do not require it ; while these values constrain the mean characteristics of the stellar population in this dwarf by comparing hydrogen to metal line strengths , they do so regardless of the exact star formation history . figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_lick ] shows the h@xmath92 vs. mg@xmath93 and h@xmath90 vs. @xmath94fe@xmath95 indices as defined by @xcite quoting @xcite with a grid of mean population characteristics overplotted .",
    "although the uncertainties are rather large , the two plots in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_lick ] together require a mean stellar metallicity of -1.0 ( @xmath960.5 ) dex solar and a mean stellar age of 3.5 @xmath96 1.5 gyrs .",
    "if the light from this dwarf is dominated by a single , massive starburst , these values represent the metallicity and the age of the starburst .",
    "if the recent star formation history of this dwarf has been more complicated ( e.g. , an older stellar population from previous star formation accounts for the metal lines ) , then the location of the lick index measurements on the population grid in figure [ fig:3c273_dwarf_lick ] yields an upper limit on the time in the past when a less massive starburst occurred .",

    "these two possible histories of this dwarf can be discriminated by obtaining a near - uv image with hst / stis .",
    "if the luminosity of this galaxy is due primarily to a single starburst 3.5 gyrs ago , the near - uv flux should be quite faint , 2.5 - 3 mags fainter than the b - band flux .",
    "if a more extensive star formation history is correct , numerous blue , horizontal branch stars will be present making the near - uv flux substantially brighter @xcite . since the evidence that some dwarf spheroidals have had star formation histories that include several star forming episodes , a single , massive starburst could be unusual",

    "the galaxy type is unusual if the absorber and galaxy are close just by chance .",
    "2 .   within rather large errors the metallicities of the galaxy and the absorber match .",
    "the super - solar [ si / c ] ratio in the absorber suggestive of recent supernova type ii enrichment and the evidence for a recent starburst in the dwarf ( balmer absorption but no emission lines ) seem to link these two together causally .    while these comparisons are strongly suggestive , the metal enrichment of such a large region of the igm by such a small galaxy may seem extreme and deserves more detailed scrutiny .",

    "so , although the number of recent supernovae and the amount of gas expelled from this galaxy are not precisely known , nevertheless , there is indirect evidence that a supernova driven wind did expel most of this galaxy s gas and dust into the igm .",
    "the absence of photometric peculiarities in the surface brightness profile shown in figures [ fig:3c273_dwarf ] and [ fig:3c273_dwarf_surf ] argue against the gas being stripped by a recent interaction with another galaxy ; nor is a nearby galaxy seen . and although this galaxy is on the southern outskirts of the virgo cluster , its distance , 3.3h@xmath21 mpc away on the sky , places it well outside the region where ram pressure stripping by intra - cluster gas would be effective .",
    "the expected low escape velocity for this dwarf ( @xmath99  km  s@xmath4 ; see below ) makes gas ejection into the surrounding igm seem more plausible than if this galaxy was much more massive .",

    "* ) .    to pursue the dwarf galaxy wind scenario , for the moment we will assume that the galaxy characteristics we see are due to a single , massive starburst 3.5 gyrs ago . in this case , the absolute b magnitude of the dwarf is almost entirely due to main sequence f stars and the implied current luminosity of the starburst is nearly @xmath100 solar luminosities ( i.e. , the fading starburst accounts for virtually all of the galaxy s observed b - band luminosity ) .",

    "either way , any model for metal line absorbers must account for dn / dz @xmath153 . in principle , dwarf galaxy starburst superwinds could account for a number density this large , even assuming a `` standard '' @xcite faint - end slope to the local luminosity function of galaxies of @xmath154 .",
    "assuming that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies went through this starburst phase in the past and that all low luminosity spirals , irregulars , blue cluster dwarfs , etc .",

    ".    the number of ly@xmath10 + metal - line absorbers produced by starburst winds could be even higher if more luminous galaxies also contribute to this process . while there is no compelling evidence for this at low-@xmath8 , at @xmath159 , @xcite find a very strong correlation between absorbers and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , that may be evidence of massive galaxies expelling gas into the igm at early epochs @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxy population represented by the lbgs is unclear ; they may be galaxies with stellar masses comparable to l@xmath20 galaxies today or they may be dwarf galaxies undergoing intense bursts of star formation .",
    "both of these models are possible given the observational constraints available .",
    "for example , @xcite infer sub-0.1m@xmath20 stellar masses for lbgs in the hubble deep field , but @xcite , using the @xcite lbg sample , infer significantly larger masses , up to the stellar mass expected for current l@xmath20 galaxies . in addition , the sizes of these star forming regions is small , 2.5 - 5.2 kpc @xcite . however , both groups note that the presence or absence of an older stellar population is not well - constrained by the available data , so that these masses and sizes must be treated as lower limits for the galaxy as a whole .",
    "so , these lbgs can either be starbursting dwarfs that will assemble into larger galaxies at later epochs or the uv - luminous star forming regions inside more massive galaxies already assembled at the epoch of observation .",
    "if the former is the case , then a consistent picture emerges for both high and low redshift in which dwarf galaxies are primarily responsible for enriching the igm with metals .",
    "if the latter is the case , then the spread of metals at early epochs is due to galaxies of a wider range of masses than in the present epoch and the estimate of the number of qso metal absorption line systems made above is a lower limit .    despite the huge number of metal - line systems which could be due to dwarf galaxy winds",
    ", these superwinds would not fill an appreciable fraction of the igm .",
    "if the expansion speed associated with these outflows is similar to what we have found here , the volume filling factor of these winds decreases with cosmic time ; i.e. , superwind expansion speed @xmath94 hubble expansion speed . even if there were about ten times more dwarfs at high - z than now and they all produced starburst superwinds before merging into larger galaxies , the volume filling factor of metal - enriched gas is less than 1% .",
    "this is consistent with numerical simulations of the spread of metals @xcite and suggests that the bulk of the ly@xmath10 forest is unenriched . while @xcite and @xcite found that galaxy interactions could spread these metals a bit more widely , we would not expect that metals would be spread much further than @xmath113 kpc from galaxies today unless there were a very large number of star formation sites spread very uniformly throughout the universe .",
    "ly@xmath10 absorbers in regions most remote from galaxies , those in galaxy voids ( paper iii and * ? ? ?",

    "if early star formation were more widespread than is possible assuming all dwarfs create superwinds , even `` void absorbers '' would contain metals at abundances comparable to the possible `` floor '' of metallicity suggested by the recent work on low column density absorbers at high-@xmath8 ( @xmath160 } = -2.5 $ ] solar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) .",
    "while the predicted number density of dwarf galaxy winds mentioned above suggests that virtually all metal - line absorbers at high-@xmath8 could be due to this process , this certainly depends upon the detectability of absorption in dwarf wind outflows .",

    "thus , assuming comparable physical size scales for absorbers in dwarf winds at @xmath161 as at @xmath49 , should be the dominant carbon species for absorbers with n@xmath166 to @xmath167 @xmath2 . and so should be the most observable metal line in high-@xmath8 dwarf wind clumps which have already cooled sufficiently to be in photoionization equilibrium with the ionizing background at that epoch . of course , could also be produced by collisional ionization of these wind clumps with the igm or with other pieces of the outflow .",
    "however , the cooling time at @xmath168 k is very short and would be unlikely to create wind clumps which are often detectable in or even in . for collisionally ionized gas , one would expect the column of to be larger than for @xcite , and so more detectable .",
    "absorption systems in which both ( and other lower ion species ) and are detected are thought to be multi - phase gas with both photo- and collisionally - ionized gas present @xcite",
    ".    recent work on the so - called `` weak '' absorbers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have led these authors to speculate along similar lines to those presented here .",
    "like the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber , standard photoionzation models of many of the weak systems yield absorber thicknesses of @xmath94 1 kpc .",
    "for the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber , a small size is also obtained and absorption is also weak . using the photoionization model of t2002 and a solar ratio of mg to c , we would predict an equivalent width of 2798  of 10 - 20 m , less than the limit ( 45 m ) we have derived from the available ghrs data ( see section 2 ) .",
    "thus , the absorber studied here is a `` local '' example of a `` weak '' absorber . @xcite",
    "interpret the small sizes of `` weak '' absorbers as indicative of their three dimensional diameters , which require a huge number of these tiny spheres to create the substantial absorber numbers seen . here , instead",
    ", we have suggested a spherical geometry of an expanding shell , with a large cross section on the sky but with small thicknesses along the line - of - sight , as inferred from photoionzation modeling .",
    "the substantial number of tiny spheres envisioned by @xcite , several hundreds to thousands per l@xmath20 galaxy , makes it difficult to imagine their origin except in some unknown population of objects .",
    "but an expanding supershell surrounding a fading dwarf galaxy could be viewed as tens to hundreds of individual filaments ( or tiny spheres ) as is commonly observed for individual supernova remnants in our own and nearby galaxies . thus , we suggest that these two views are compatible and the differences largely semantic , so that no novel population of objects is required to explain their numbers",
    ".    however , a substantial percentage ( 25% ) of the weak absorber population have been found by @xcite to have fe abundances comparable to solar metallicity .",
    "this would be very unexpected for any absorber produced by outflowing winds from a dwarf galaxy , both given the low metallicity of stars and gas seen in dwarfs ( e.g. , i zw 18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the substantial amount of even lower metallicity gas that an outflowing wind might be expected to sweep up in its progress through the igm . if these high metallicities are correct , they argue for large numbers of undetected star forming pockets outside of galaxies , and against the dwarf galaxy wind model proposed here .",
    "these as - yet undetected star formation sites also would be the high-@xmath8 sources of metals required to produce a universal `` floor '' of metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the method used by @xcite to determine metallicity makes use of metal line widths and the ly@xmath10 profile only . without , for example , information about the higher order lyman series absorption lines , this method may not be accurate .",
    "recently , @xcite have used uv spectra of bright agn to show that the curve - of - growth method using the lyman lines observed by fuse obtains @xmath44-values which are a factor of two smaller in the mean than the @xmath44-values obtained from ly@xmath10 profile fitting alone .",
    "this difference leads to an upward correction in hydrogen column density and thus to a downward correction in metallicity .",
    "because the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber has seven detected lyman lines @xcite , the hydrogen column density derived by this method is quite secure . as a result",
    ", this absorber can provide a test of the accuracy of the @xcite method for determining metallicities . following their method ,",
    "we begin with the equivalent widths and @xmath44-values measured for well - detected metal lines ( see t2002 ) .",
    "we then constructed a grid of photoionization models , requiring that the models be compatible with all metal line ratios , widths and limits .",
    "this procedure sets a limit on the temperature of the gas , which we can use to constrain the line width associated with the metal - bearing gas .",
    "fixing the ly@xmath10 redshift and line width to the values required for the metal - bearing gas , and allowing additional ly@xmath10 components , we then find the column density associated with the metals .",
    "using this procedure on the metal - line and ly@xmath10 data for the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber yields n@xmath169 @xmath2 and a metallicity of @xmath170 solar .",
    "this should be compared with the 6% obtained for this absorber by t2002 .",
    "thus , rigby et al . would have inferred a much higher metallicity for the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber by using their method .",
    "therefore , we assert that the metal abundances in the absorbers rigby et al . have studied are uncertain and may be substantially less than they calculate .",
    "if this is correct , the dwarf superwind hypothesis is an excellent fit to the various types of `` weak '' systems they have studied .",
    "and there is no requirement for as yet unobserved , very numerous , small pockets of star formation well outside galaxies .",
    "the variations in observed species and ionization parameter seen in weak systems and other weak metal line systems seem explicable given the possible variations in sightlines through supernova remnants , which might intercept cool filaments or hotter intra - filament regions or both .",
    "high quality uv spectra of background sources viewed through galactic supernova remnants are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "in this paper we have reported the discovery of a dwarf , post - starburst galaxy 71h@xmath5 kpc away on the sky and at the same recession velocity to within the combined errors as the highest column density ly@xmath10 absorber in the 3c  273 uv spectrum obtained with hst and fos , ghrs and stis . a detailed study of this absorber using a stis e140 m spectrum @xcite in conjunction with fuse observations of higher order lyman lines @xcite has been made by t2002 . based upon standard photoionization models , t2002 found a metallicity for this n@xmath97 = 10@xmath171 @xmath2 absorber of 6% solar , an absorber thickness along the line - of - sight of 70 parsecs and an overabundance of si to c of 0.2 dex relative to solar . using lick absorption line indices measured from a ground - based spectrum of the nearby dwarf ( m@xmath172 ) obtained at the apache point observatory s 3.5 m telescope , we estimate that the galaxy s stellar population has a mean age of 3.5 @xmath96 1.5 gyrs and a mean metallicity of 3 - 30% solar . strong balmer absorption ( e.g. , 2   equivalent width of h@xmath90 ) and the absence of [ o ii ] and h@xmath10 emission , as well as the absence of 21 cm emission ( m@xmath77 m@xmath78 ) are strongly suggestive , but can not prove , that this galaxy experienced a massive starburst @xmath1403.5 gyrs ago , whose subsequent supernovae blew out all of its remaining gas . given this interpretation , the evidence for a direct connection between this small galaxy and the nearby ly@xmath10 absorber is quite convincing : approximate matches in recession velocity and metallicity , and a si / c ratio in the absorber suggesting recent supernova type ii enrichment . despite an extremely thorough search for faint galaxies near the 3c  273 sightline ( m93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the present work ) , only this one dwarf has been found close to this absorber .",
    "the next nearest galaxies are two other dwarf galaxies @xmath173h@xmath21 kpc away , so that the only viable alternative picture for the 3c  273 absorber is gas produced by at least several nearby galaxies , including this dwarf .",
    "optical ( b , r ) images of this dwarf obtained at the apo 3.5 m show that , despite the galaxy s elliptical appearance , its surface brightness profile is much better fit by an exponential disk with scale length 0.4h@xmath5 kpc and no optical peculiarities in the b - band image that would indicate the presence of dust . if a massive starburst did occur in this galaxy @xmath98 gyrs ago , the type ii supernovae would have had sufficient energy to accelerate several @xmath174 m@xmath78 of to the speeds necessary to reach 70h@xmath5 kpc radius by now .",
    "thus , although we can not prove beyond all doubt that the atoms producing the absorber came from this dwarf galaxy due to a massive starburst superwind , this seems to be the most logical conclusion .",
    "also , since spectral synthesis models of the evolving stellar population of starbursts @xcite suggest that this galaxy was @xmath88 times brighter in b - band during its starburst phase and will fade ten times more in the next few gyrs , this galaxy is an example of the intermediate stage in the evolutionary process that @xcite suggests begins as a blue , starbursting dwarf galaxy and ends as a dormant , dwarf spheroidal .",
    "the primary uncertainty in this proposed scenario is that this galaxy experienced a single , massive starburst @xmath1403.5 gyrs ago , which accounts for its current luminosity and stellar properties .",
    "a starburst of this magnitude in a dwarf galaxy ( requiring 1 m@xmath78 yr@xmath4 for 10@xmath107 yrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is unexpectedly large .",
    "further , the indirect evidence from observations of the stellar populations of local group dwarf spheroidals is that low luminosity galaxies typically experience several epochs of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , even in the case that the starburst which took place in this galaxy accounts for only @xmath30 of all of its stars and occurred as recently as 2 gyrs ago , a supernovae - driven wind can still account for the observed properties and location of the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber towards 3c  273 .",
    "a near - uv image of this dwarf galaxy could determine whether the massive , single starburst model is correct .",
    "@xcite models of instanteous starbursts have little mid - uv flux more than 1 gyr after the starburst , fading from 6 to 20 times less flux than at b - band between 1 and 4 gyrs after the starburst",
    ". however , stellar synthesis models with several star formation epochs or continuous star formation have sufficient blue horizontal branch stars so that the mid - uv flux never gets this low compared to b - band ( see e.g. , @xcite on the  uv - upturn  in ellipticals , which has an onset of @xmath175 gyrs after a starburst ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the association of this dwarf galaxy with a ly@xmath10 + metal - line absorption system is interesting as an individual example of a `` cheshire cat '' galaxy @xcite , it also may be indicative of a large population of starbursting dwarf galaxies , whose supernovae can drive gas away from these dwarfs due to their shallow gravitational potential wells @xcite .",
    "we are currently searching for a faint galaxy near the rx j1230.8 + 0115  sightline that could be responsible for a very similar pair of metal - line absorbers at 1666  km  s@xmath4  , @xmath176h@xmath5 kpc away on the sky from the 1586  km  s@xmath4  absorber in 3c  273 .",
    "if a dwarf galaxy is present near rx j1230.8 + 0115 this will provide further proof in favor of the dwarf starburst superwind model for these absorbers .",
    "all other known metal line systems are too far away ( @xmath177 ) to allow dwarfs similar to this one to be observed by current surveys for galaxies near qso absorbers ( i.e. , at m@xmath178 ; m93 ) .",
    "therefore , metal - line absorbers would be identified with more luminous galaxies at greater impact parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which happen to be in the same galaxy filament as a dwarf ( or dwarves ) closer to the sightline .",
    "we view the discovery of this dwarf close to a ly@xmath10 + metal - line absorption system as strong evidence in favor of the @xcite scenario used to explain the large population of `` faint , blue galaxies '' seen on deep optical images .",
    "the large numbers of faint , blue galaxies plus the theoretical expectations of standard heirarchical pictures of galaxy formation strongly suggest that there were many more of these dwarf galaxies in the past than now .",
    "if most of these dwarfs went through a violent starburst phase , dwarf starburst superwinds could be responsible for @xmath179 ly@xmath10 + metal - line absorption systems in the spectra of high-@xmath8 qsos .",
    "this estimate is based upon the assumption that all dwarf galaxies produce a 75h@xmath5 kpc radius shell of metal - enriched gas around them before they merge to form larger galaxies .",
    "evidence from other work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that larger galaxies ( @xmath148l@xmath20 ) form bound halos of denser gas and may not contribute significantly to the spread of metals into the igm .",
    "but , even if all dwarfs produce massive starburst superwinds , @xmath9 of the igm would become enriched in metals , leaving most of the ly@xmath10 forest absorbers metal - free at the lowest column densities .",
    "this conclusion can be tested by determining if ly@xmath10 absorbers in galaxy voids ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) contain metals at a level @xmath152 solar .",
