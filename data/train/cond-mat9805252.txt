    "ring polymers have been extensively studied experimentally by several groups , not always leading to completely consistent results @xcite .",
    "indeed , the synthesis of the samples of unknotted and nonconcatenated rings ( see fig .  [ figsketch ] ) remains a very delicate issue @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the general conclusion emerging from these studies is that the dynamics of rings is quite similar to that of linear chains of the same molecular mass and density @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a surprising result from the point of view of the reptation model which describes the flow behavior of entangled linear polymer chains @xcite . in this effectively single - chain model ,",
    "the constraints on the motion of a reference chain due to the interactions with its neighbors are replaced by a curvilinear  tube \" within which the chain  reptates \" : relaxation of the constraints occurs only at the chain ends .",
    "clearly , a closed ring polymer ( having no ends ) can not reptate in this conventional sense .",
    "accordingly , the motion in a melt of rings should be quite different from that of an analogous linear chain system ; and at first sight on would expect it to be slower . indeed it was argued @xcite that motion of ring polymers should be exponentially slow and comparable with that of star polymers @xcite .",
    "this is however not borne out by rheological measurements on polystyrene ( ps ) and polybutadyene ( pb ) rings , which showed that the zero - shear viscosities @xmath6 for melts of rings for all molecular weights considered are similar to , but even slightly smaller than , those for linear chains @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath6 in ps rings is virtually indistinguishable from that of linear polystyrene of high enough molecular weight ; all viscosities display classical wlf or vogel type temperature dependence and they can be superimposed on a single master curve . for linear chains ,",
    "two power - law regimes arise in the mass dependence of the viscosity , corresponding to rouselike and entangled motion .",
    "unexpectedly , the same is found for ring polymers . below a critical mass @xmath7",
    "the viscosity seems to increase with an exponent @xmath8 which is larger than the expected @xmath9 for ideal rouse behavior .",
    "the values for rings and linear chains of the same molecular weight are of similar magnitude . in the high mass regime ( @xmath10 ) the viscosities increase more strongly , again with a power similar to the linear case . an exponential increase in the range of masses available ( up to @xmath11 )",
    "is explicitly excluded @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the dynamics of ring molecules to their linear counterparts is also reported on a more microscopic level from tracer diffusion measurements @xcite .",
    "dilute labeled ps chains of mass @xmath12 , in a matrix of mass @xmath13 , were measured using forward recoil spectroscopy .",
    "different topologies ( rings in linear matrices@xcite , linear chains in ring matrices @xcite , rings in microgel @xcite ) were investigated and compared to linear chains in linear matrices .",
    "unfortunately , there exist so far no systematic measurements of ring tracers in matrices of rings ( of identical size ) in which the molecular mass covers a significant range .",
    "however , consistent with the rheological measurements quoted above , the tracer diffusion of linear ps in ring matrices was found to be nearly identical to that of linear ps in linear ps matrices @xcite .",
    "this is again a surprising result in view of theoretical concepts of matrix dependent tracer diffusion @xcite .    a suggestion by lodge et al .",
    "@xcite is that the experiments on rings may be reconciled with the reptation concept by taking into account the higher entanglement length .",
    "the critical mass for entanglement can be estimated from the viscosities or from the shear modulus .",
    "ps rings exhibit a plateau modulus approximately one - half ( one - fifth for pb ) that for linear polymers , suggesting that rings are less effective at forming entanglements .",
    "rubber elasticity arguments indicate a critical mass for polystyrene cycles of @xmath14 compared to @xmath15 for linear chains .",
    "if one now makes a comparison _ at an equal number of entanglements _ ring melts in fact have higher viscosities than linear chains .",
    "the experimental viscosity data then lie in the unentangled / entangled crossover region , where it is clear from the linear polymer results that reptation is not the only available mode .",
    "this explanation would allow a crossover to much slower ring dynamics at very high molecular weights .    no theoretical explanation for this increase of the critical mass exists , but it seems reasonable to relate it to the idea that ring conformations in the melt may be partially collapsed @xcite .",
    "besides the usual excluded volume interaction between two neighboring chains there is a topological interaction due to the exclusion of knotted and concatenated ring configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ figsketch ] ) .",
    "while the excluded volume interaction is screened out whenever the overlap with other chains is large ( i.e. , as long @xmath16 , true for large chains if @xmath17 ) the topological interaction in 3-dimensions need not be screened and should cause a reduction in the size exponent @xmath18 below the gaussian value ( @xmath19 ) .    despite this argument , no experimental study of the radius of gyration of rings in the melt appears to have been made .",
    "a good understanding of the static properties of the system is of course an indispensable starting point for a reasonable description of the dynamics , so this is unfortunate .",
    "detailed static measurements ( in both dilute and concentrated systems ) could also provide a stringent test on the quality of the ring synthesis , as mckenna et al . have pointed out @xcite . without them , for many synthesis routes it is hard to exclude the possibility of knotted or concatenated rings , nor that of a small fraction of linear chain contaminant which might modify the viscosity substantially ( by threading the rings , for example ) @xcite .    in view of those experimental difficulties , a detailed simulation study to investigate both the statics and the dynamics in a melt of rings",
    "is certainly warranted .",
    "most previous attempts are based on pakula s `` cooperative motion algorithm '' @xcite . while this algorithm can give correct results for the statics ( especially for melts ) its value for studying dynamics",
    "is questionable ( see section 2 below ) . in the following we",
    "study melts of non - knotted , non - concatenated rings within the well - established  bond - fluctuation model \" ( bfm ) to get a better insight in their statics and dynamics .",
    "apart from its computational efficiency , an advantage of the method is that comprehensive data for linear chains have already been obtained @xcite with which quantitative comparisons can be made . indeed , even if ring polymers did not exist experimentally , this comparison might help illuminate several longstanding but still controversial issues in the dynamics of entangled linear chains @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we give briefly some technical comments on the bfm simulation performed . in section 3 results on the conformation of isolated rings ( in an athermal solvent ) are presented , showing that the unknottedness constraint is insufficient to swell the rings significantly beyond what would be caused by excluded volume forces alone .",
    "molten rings , on the other hand , are found to be quite compact with an exponent @xmath20 , consistent with the assumption @xcite that roughly one degree of freedom is lost for every topological interaction with a neighboring chain .",
    "we then show , in section 4 , that the dynamics of rings and linear chains are qualitatively similar over much of the range of chain length that we are able to simulate .",
    "for the largest rings , however , a perfect scaling ( involving a single characteristic time for each chain length ) is still obeyed whereas for this size of linear chain significant departures are observed .",
    "this allows us to confirm the suggestion that the entanglement mass is much larger for rings .",
    "we also study the degree to which rings thread through one another , a question addressed in both sections 3 and 4 .",
    "this seems to be insufficient to allow large clusters of mutually entangled material to build up .",
    "the extent of entanglement , quantified roughly as the number of neighboring rings contacting a given molecule , nevertheless appears relevant for dynamics : for both rings and their linear counterparts the diffusion constant is shown to scale as the mass of the correlation hole ( at least , in the range of chain lengths studied ) . finally in section 5",
    "we give our conclusions and discuss the impact of these ring investigations on our understanding of entangled polymer dynamics .",
    "the algorithm used in this investigation is the well - established  bond - fluctuation model \" ( bfm ) of k. kremer et al @xcite .",
    "this coarse - grained 3-dimensional lattice model has proven to be especially useful for investigating the universal features of statics and dynamics in dense polymeric melts @xcite .",
    "a small number of chemical repeat units ( i.e. a kuhnian segment ) is mapped onto a lattice monomer such that the relevant characteristics of polymers are retained : connectivity of the monomers along a chain and excluded volume of the monomers .",
    "each monomer occupies a whole unit cell of a simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "adjacent monomers along a polymer are connected via one of 108 allowed bond vectors .",
    "these are chosen such that the local excluded volume interactions prevents the chains from crossing each other during their motion .",
    "this conservation of the topology ensures that the rings ( which are set up initially as thin `` sausages '' ) remain neither knotted with themselves nor concatenated with one another during the relaxation and sampling . in our athermal simulation , `` local jumps '' are realized by choosing one monomer at random and attempting to jump over the distance of one lattice spacing in one of the six basic directions ( also randomly chosen ) .",
    "the attempt is accepted if excluded volume restriction are satisfied and the new bond vectors to the neighbors along the ring belong to the allowed set .",
    "there has already been made a simulation study of ring polymers by frisch et al @xcite in the framework of the bfm .",
    "however , due to the large cpu - time demands , that study was restricted to single rings ; also the dynamical properties were not very directly addressed .",
    "the only existing simulation data on the statics and dynamics of rings in the melt use pakula s  cooperative rearrangement algorithm \" @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the local jumps utilized in the bfm , this algorithm changes simultaneously and collectively the monomer positions on a number of different chains . while giving correctly the static properties ,",
    "a clear correspondence between monte - carlo time and real time is yet to be established for this algorithm and its dynamical interpretation is accordingly unclear .    in the present bfm investigation",
    "we want to extend the careful study of linear chains made by paul et al @xcite to ring polymers and compare our results to their data on linear chains . at a filling fraction @xmath1 of occupied lattice sites ,",
    "many static and dynamic features of molten polymeric materials are reproduced by the bfm .",
    "for example , the single chain conformations obey gaussian statistics down to the screening length @xmath21 ( in units of the lattice constant ) of the excluded volume interaction obtained from the static structure factor @xcite .",
    "there are extensive results on the dynamical properties covering the range from an unentangled behavior for short chain lengths up to the onset of reptation - like motion for chain length @xmath22 .",
    "of course , the dynamics of long polymers in a dense melt slows down dramatically with growing chain length and therefore poses huge demands on cpu - time requirements . for the present investigation",
    "we employ a very efficient implementation of the bfm on a massively parallel cray t3d @xcite . using a 2 dimensional geometrical decomposition of the simulation grid of linear extension @xmath23",
    ", we employ 64 t3d processors .",
    "this permits us to equilibrate systems comprising 131072 monomers and ring lengths up to 512 ( statics ) or 256 ( dynamics ) statistical segments .",
    "this study involved about @xmath24 hours of single processor cpu time .",
    "the starting configurations consisted of straight sausage - like rings ( loops enclosing no area ) which were carefully equilibrated for at least one relaxation time ( i.e. the center of mass had moved a distance comparable to the chain size ) before any data were taken .",
    "indeed , for all but the longest chains , runs were continued well beyond this ( so as to generate dynamical data ) which enabled us to confirm that the static chain extensions had settled to their equilibrium values by this time .",
    "in this section we consider the effects of the unknottedness and nonconcatenation constraints on the conformational properties of dilute and molten rings .",
    "while the effect of the former constraint on isolated rings turns out to be irrelevant the non - concatenation requirement significantly compactifies molten rings .",
    "the size of the rings is measured firstly with the usual mean - square radius of gyration @xmath25 ; as a second measure , we define the average distance between pairs of monomers that are @xmath26 monomers apart along the ring contour , @xmath27 , and call this the mean - square ring diameter . for isolated rings in an athermal solvent results for both quantities",
    "are presented in table  [ tab1 ] . in agreement with previous monte carlo studies by frisch et al @xcite the simulation yields a ring size @xmath2 with exponent @xmath28 for the radius of gyration and @xmath29 for the ring diameter .",
    "these values are only slightly larger than the excluded volume exponent ( @xmath30 ) for linear athermal chains , the difference lying within the range of the statistical error .",
    "the influence of the topological constraints on the static properties of isolated rings thus appears not to alter the chain - swelling exponent in 3 dimensions ( though there may be a prefactor effect ) @xcite .",
    "this finding concurs with the analytical studies of des cloizeaux @xcite and is now also confirmed experimentally .",
    "indeed , while early sans data of j.  higgins et al @xcite seemed to indicate a nearly gaussian statistics for rings in good solvent , later the delicate dependency of the ring properties on preparation conditions was overcome by g.  hadziioannou et al @xcite and j.  roovers et al @xcite corroborating that the statistics are as for linear chains in a good solvent .",
    "however , a decrease of the @xmath31-temperature of isolated rings ( compared to linear chains ) by several kelvin has been measured .",
    "this is defined by the point at which the second virial coefficient from the light scattering measurements equals zero , and seems to be the only manifestation of the unknottedness constraint @xcite .",
    "a monte carlo study of the @xmath31-point depression of isolated rings , including a careful finite - size analysis could certainly yield interesting additional information ; we do not attempt this here .",
    "the situation changes completely in the other limit of molten rings where , confirming pakula s simulation @xcite we find very compact rings ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "when naively fitted without any finite size analysis , the ring sizes yield an exponent @xmath32 for the ring diameter @xmath33 and a slightly higher value , @xmath34 , for the radius of gyration @xmath35 .",
    "those values are quite similar to the ones obtained by pakula .",
    "however , finite - size corrections are clearly detactable in the curvature of the data points , and a more careful fitting is necessary , as explained below and in fig .",
    "[ figfsa ] .",
    "this yields in an extrapolation to the limit of infinite masses a distinctly lower exponent @xmath36 , which ( as it should ) becomes the same for our two measures of ring size , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    at the volume fraction @xmath39 used in the simulation , the excluded volume interaction is not completely screened , as pointed out in the previous section . this explains why the radius of gyration , which is more sensitive to short - scale structure , tends to give larger exponents @xmath40 than the diameter which probes larger distances ( fig .",
    "[ figfsa ] ) . at high masses",
    "this short - scale effect of the excluded volume will become less and less important , so both the ratio of diameter to the radius of gyration ( inset of fig .  [ figfsa ] ) , and the running exponents @xmath40 , tend to become smaller .",
    "these exponents are plotted against the natural variable of the screening ( proportional to @xmath41 ) @xcite ; the procedure brings all the measured values @xmath40 to lie on straight lines which permit a precise finite size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "as one sees from fig .",
    "[ figfsa ] the low masses gives exponents close to those obtained previously ; the highest masses used yield an exponent @xmath42 . only in the limit of infinite masses",
    "does the short - scale excluded volume effect vanish and the two lines for @xmath33 and @xmath35 merge at a value @xmath43 .",
    "this value is consistent with a crude but interesting flory - like estimate of the free energy of a polymer ring given by cates and deutsch @xcite .",
    "they argued that , if a ring of polymerization index @xmath44 has size @xmath45 , it is overlapped with a number of neighboring rings of order @xmath46 ( in @xmath47 dimensions ) .",
    "the more spatially extended the ring , the more entropy is lost by the nonconcatenation constraint with its neighbors .",
    "the simplest possible estimate of this is to say that the number of degrees of freedom lost due to the constraint is proportional to the number @xmath46 of neighbors which the ring is prevented from threading .",
    "this gives a contribution to the free energy of @xmath48 tending to decrease the ring size . on the other hand",
    ", there is also an entropy penalty if the ring becomes too squashed ; the free energy required to squash a gaussian chain of @xmath44 steps into a region of linear size @xmath45 less than @xmath49 scales as @xmath50 .",
    "adding these contributions , and minimizing over @xmath45 , gives a characteristic size scaling as @xmath2 with @xmath51 .",
    "hence in three dimensions the exponent is @xmath52 , very close to the value found by our simulation .",
    "note that the latter value is definitely smaller than the result @xmath53 put forward recently by m.  brereton and t.  vilgis @xcite .",
    "we note that from the measured exponents of the chain size of an isolated chain @xmath54 and of ring chains @xmath55 a crossover scaling can be obtained in the usual way .",
    "this yields for the ring size in the semidilute concentration range , @xmath56 where the monomer density is @xmath57 and the usual crossover density ( overlap threshold ) is @xmath58 .",
    "the decrease in the size of a ring with @xmath57 is much more pronounced than for linear chains where @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "[ figprobre ] , we show simulation data for the probability distribution @xmath60 of the diameter of a ring as a function of the characteristic variable @xmath61 .",
    "data is given for various masses up to @xmath62 .",
    "the scaling collapse becomes more and more perfect with increasing mass indicating again that the local interactions become irrelevant for ring sizes much larger than the excluded volume screening length @xmath63 . in principle",
    ", this distribution should define some further characteristic exponents , assuming that , as for linear chains @xcite the distribution rises with a power @xmath64 for small @xmath65 and drops off essentially as @xmath66 for large @xmath65 . for isolated linear chains the exponents @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be written in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath69 ( the latter is the exponent controlling the @xmath44 dependence of the free energy ) .",
    "unfortunately , although the scaling in fig .",
    "[ figprobre ] is good , the data is not precise enough to extract any corresponding exponents in this case .",
    "accordingly we leave this issue for future investigations .    a quantity of more direct experimental relevance than @xmath70 is the static structure factor @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ figsq ] the values of @xmath72 for masses up to @xmath0 , expressed as function of the characteristic variable @xmath73 , superimpose ( apart from the spurious bragg peak in each case ) onto a single master curve . consistently with our earlier discussion of the scaling of the ring size , a self - similar power - law regime is apparent , and shows a fractal dimension @xmath74 as expected .",
    "the gaussian dimension 2 is clearly ruled out by our data @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , and above , the probability of threading of a ring polymer by its neighbors is implicated in the mechanism of partial collapse , and may also have dynamical consequences by way of long - lived clusters of entangled material slowing down the relaxation times .",
    "it is difficult to define precisely what is meant by threading ( in either static or dynamical terms ) but a partial measure of the ease with which a ring can be threaded is to measure the area of its projection onto a random direction .",
    "this area @xmath75 is defined as a signed quantity ( the component in that direction of the vector area of the ring ) which vanishes for any configuration in which the ring exactly retraces its own steps .",
    "a measure of the  threadability \" is provided by @xmath76 ; it turns out that @xmath77 as is shown in fig .",
    "the scaling is the same as would be naively expected .",
    "note that sausage - like configurations would involve very small values of @xmath78 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath79 indicates that the rings have no tendency to retrace their own steps ; a fact also revealed by inspection of snapshots .",
    "another quantity that may be relevant in measuring the strength of the topological interactions is the number of chains touching a reference chain @xmath80 .",
    "two chains are defined to be  touching \" whenever their monomers include pairs separated by a distance less or equal to @xmath81 lattice constants .",
    "( this somewhat arbitrary microscopic distance was chosen to include all the monomers within the first peak of the monomer - monomer correlation function . )",
    "intuitively @xmath82 should vary as the number of chains within the  correlation hole \" spanned by a given chain , and we see in fig .",
    "[ figa ] that @xmath80 indeed scales as @xmath83 .",
    "the plateau at high enough masses confirms the self - similarity of rings in the melt which was already indicated by the scale invariance of the diameter distribution in fig .",
    "[ figprobre ] .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , there is some experimental evidence that the dynamics of rings are similar to their linear counterparts , at least up to the largest molecular masses that can readily be obtained .",
    "our simulation data , presented below , confirms this for rings of up to @xmath62 monomers by comparing mean - square displacements , chain and cooperative motion correlation functions , and the resulting diffusion coefficients and relaxation times .",
    "we characterize the dynamics by measuring three different mean - square displacement functions , describing the motion of monomers @xmath84 in the lab frame , the motion of monomers in the center - of - mass frame of a given ring , @xmath85 , and the motion of the center of mass itself , @xmath86 .",
    "the mean - square displacement functions for molten rings are given in fig .",
    "[ figg1g2g3 ] .",
    "these quantities are scaled by the mean square characteristic ring size @xmath87 whereas the time coordinate is scaled by the rotational relaxation time @xmath88 .",
    "this rotational time is the decay time for relaxation of a ring diameter ( the vectorial displacement between monomers @xmath26 apart in the sequence ) which is obtained from the correlation function @xmath89 described below ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figcn ] ) , and its scaling with @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figtauee ] ) .",
    "apart from the mass @xmath90 all curves perfectly superimpose with the use of this single scale factor for each chain .",
    "this indicates that no second time - scale is present as would be expected for an entangled system ( the entanglement time ) .",
    "such scaling is sometimes called rouse behaviour @xcite , but here we describe it as  unentangled scaling \" since the power laws involved need not be those of the rouse model .",
    "notably , no crossover whatever is detectable from this scaling to a modified ( reptation or other ) motion , involving a second time scale , even for the largest rings studied ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this contrasts with the fact that for linear chains of mass larger than @xmath22 the unentangled scaling starts to break down , with clear signs of a crossover to a new regime ( whose exponents could not , however , be reliably measured ) @xcite .",
    "this finding confirms that any entanglement length for rings is larger than that for linear chains of the same type , in agreement with experimental inference @xcite .    as mentioned before",
    ", it is tempting to associate this with the fact that the rings are partially collapsed .",
    "crudely one could argue that for a given degree of entanglement , the number of chains in the correlation hole ( which scales as @xmath83 ) should be the same for rings and linear chains .",
    "this would give a rough estimate of @xmath91 bfm monomers as the breakdown point of the unentangled scaling in the ring case .",
    "this estimate is broadly consistent with the entanglement mass for rings reported in experiments as lying between 2 ( for ps ) or 5 ( for pb ) times as large as for linear chains , as discussed in the introduction",
    ".    qualitatively the mean square displacements of rings displayed here show very similar behavior to that of short linear chains , up to masses of order @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "( however as mentioned above , for larger masses the scaling breaks down in the linear chain case , and in this regime the rings and linear chains are no longer precisely alike . ) while the center of mass follows the fickian type of diffusion at long times ( @xmath93 ) a clear signature of net forces acting on the center of mass of the chains is displayed at short times , when the center of mass displacement @xmath94 is proportional to @xmath95 , with an effective exponent @xmath96 .",
    "( within a true rouse model , in which each monomer in the system is subject to uncorrelated random forces , this exponent would have the fickian value of unity at all times . )",
    "this effect was also observed for linear chains with a slightly higher effective exponent @xmath97 at the same density @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there it was also verified that the exponent @xmath65 is density dependent , approaching 1 in the low density limit ; it is very likely that this is similar for rings .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , as for linear chains , there is a net force acting on the center of mass generated by the interaction of the test chain with surrounding ones , slowing down the chain motion at short times .",
    "the monomer motion may also be split into two regimes characteristic of short and long times . while in the latter the monomeric displacements approach asymptotically that of the whole chain ( @xmath98 ) , the conformational properties of the rings in the melt are reflected in the short time anomalous diffusion regime .",
    "the involvement of more and more ring monomers as the lifetime of a fluctuation increases , gives by general scaling arguments a mean - square monomer displacement of @xmath99 .",
    "for our rings ( @xmath20 ) this yields an exponent of about 0.45 which agrees well with the dynamical simulation data shown in fig .",
    "[ figg1g2g3 ] .",
    "( the agreement is even better if one uses for each chain length the measured exponent @xmath40 which is somewhat larger than the extrapolated value @xmath100 , as explained in the previous section . ) defining a monomeric mobility @xmath101 by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the monomer size , perhaps surprisingly we find ( as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) that @xmath104 for rings is about 4 times larger than for linear chains where @xmath105 .",
    "the mean - square monomer displacement in the frame of the center of mass , @xmath106 , follows ( as expected ) for small times the same behavior of that in the lab frame @xmath107 while for long times it approaches ( by definition ) the mean - square radius of gyration of the rings .    in order to characterize succinctly the mean square displacement curves for rings , and to compare them to the linear chain counterparts , we define ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) three characteristic times , @xmath108 according to the following criteria : @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "each @xmath112-parameter is a measure of the decay of the corresponding displacement function , as indicated in fig .",

    "apart from a bit of scatter we obtain , independently of mass , the ratios @xmath113 ( compared to @xmath114 for linear chains ) and @xmath115 ( compared to @xmath116 ) .",
    "this means that , normalizing by the motion of a monomer in the lab frame , both the center of mass motion , and that of monomers in the center of mass frame , take longer to reach their long time asymptotic limits than is the case for linear chains .",

    "the situation is somewhat different for the diffusion constants @xmath123 obtained for rings in the melt .",
    "the first striking point is that the rings diffuse _ faster _ than linear chains of same mass and density .",
    "this confirms the trend found experimentally in zero - shear viscosities for ps and pb melts of rings @xcite .",
    "second , for rings , there is no sign of curvature on the log plot , which is consistent with the idea that the entanglement mass for rings is larger than for linear chains .",
    "in fact , the diffusion constant of linear chains , also shown in fig .",
    "[ figdiff ] , has previously been interpreted in terms of a crossover from true rouse behaviour for small @xmath44 ( which would appear as a plateau on this representation ) to a new , entangled regime , with the crossover effects first appearing for @xmath125 . for linear chains ( but not rings ) this crossover behaviour was much more strongly seen in @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "looking at the center of mass diffusion data alone , however , there is no sign of a small-@xmath44 plateau , and no firm evidence of a crossover to a new regime of entangled behaviour , even in the linear chain case !",
    "this suggests that other interpretations might also be worth investigating .",
    "if one assumes that , within the range of masses studied , both linear chains and rings follow _ a single _ power law behavior , then one finds respectively @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the two cases @xcite . remarkably therefore , in each case that the diffusion constant varies inversely with the mass of the `` correlation hole '' of surrounding chains : @xmath130 .",
    "this suggests a mental picture in which the center - of - mass mobility of any given chain is governed by having to  drag \" the contents of the correlation hole along with it .",
    "although this picture should clearly break down for long linear chains ( where a more conventional reptation picture becomes appropriate ) it could provide some insight into the behaviour at intermediate @xmath44 . for rings , this ",
    "intermediate \" regime appears to be more strongly developed .",
    "if one compares rings and linear chains at equal mean - square gyration radius , then the rings have slightly smaller diffusion constants than linear chains . assuming that any increase in the entanglement length of rings is due to partial collapse , this is consistent with the experimental fact that the viscosities of ring melts , compared with linear chains at an equal number of entanglements , have slightly higher viscosities .",
    "master curves for some further correlation functions are presented in fig .",
    "[ figcn ] .",
    "the correlation function @xmath89 is analogous to the end - end vector correlation function usually used for linear chains @xcite .",
    "it describes the decay of the diameter vector @xmath131 between two monomers of a ring separated by @xmath26 monomers .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath88 , used to scale the time axis in the various plots discussed already , is defined as the time at which this correlation function has decayed by a factor @xmath132 .",
    "note that this correlation function shows a near - exponential decay .",
    "this contrasts with the second correlation function @xmath133 , which measures the decay in the mean number of chains ,  touching \" ( in the sense defined above ) a given reference chain at time zero , that are still touching it ( or touching it again ) at time @xmath134 . from this quantity",
    "is subtracted an asymptotic plateau value ( arising from the finite size of the simulation cell ) so that the correlation function vanishes at long time ; we normalize to @xmath135 .",
    "this @xmath133 apparently decays with a power law ( fig .",
    "[ figcn ] ) .",
    "this correlation function @xmath133 was defined in an attempt to monitor any possible clustering of entangled rings ( leading to a fraction of slow - moving material ) , by detecting possible long - lived contacts between rings that might arise from threading of one ring by another .",
    "although the number of contacting rings remains large for times much longer than the measured diffusive relaxation times , there is nothing like a plateau ; the power - law decay of @xmath136 apparently scales with @xmath88 , so there is no new time scale due to clustering @xcite .",
    "it seems that the threading probability is not large enough to form large clusters whose percolation ( for example ) could lead to new dynamical phenomena .    in fig .",
    "[ figtauee ] we compare the relaxation times @xmath88 as defined from the decay of the diameter correlation function @xmath89 ( and used above for the scaling of the time axis ) with the quantity @xmath137 which also defines a characteristic time .",
    "to a good accuracy , these are proportional , but the latter is larger by a factor of about 10 .",
    "the scaling of the relaxation time , by either definition , follows approximately an @xmath138 law ( as do the times @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 we obtained from the mean square displacements ) , as predicted from the simple rouse model for gaussian chains or rings .",
    "however , we believe that this is fortuitous , the diffusion constant being the more fundamental quantity ; indeed , true rouse motion for partially collapsed objects ( as we know the rings to be ) would give a higher power . for comparison ,",
    "the relaxation time obtained from the diffusion coefficient via @xmath142 for linear chains is also plotted . in the range of @xmath44 studied , this follows a @xmath143 power law .",
    "( the linear chain values are taken out of ref .",
    "@xcite , some data for short chains are added . )",
    "in this article we have demonstrated using the bond - fluctuation model various pronounced effects of topological constraints on the static and dynamic properties of rings .",
    "while the size of isolated rings scale as their linear counterparts , molten rings are quite compact objects characterized by an exponent @xmath36 for the chain size @xmath45 .",
    "this is consistent with a crude flory - like argument @xcite suggesting that one degree of freedom is lost for every non - concatenation constraint .",
    "experimentally , melt of rings seem to show dynamical behavior very similar to linear chains , at least for the masses of rings usually studied @xcite .",
    "the same seems to be true in our computational study , which is of course limited to relatively modest masses  though ones for which , in linear chains , the onset of entanglements would clearly be detectable .",
    "we see no sign of a similar effect for rings , suggesting a larger effective entanglement length in the rings case . indeed , in our simulation ( which ignores hydrodynamics but respects the topological constraints ) conformational relaxation of the rings is well described by a dynamical scaling involving a single characteristic time scale @xmath88 for each chain , whereas an entanglement crossover would introduce a second timescale",
    ". nonetheless , the motion is not that of a simple rouse model ( chains moving independently subject to local friction and uncorrelated noise ) : interchain forces are manifest in the reduced effective exponent for the center of mass motion at short time scales , or equivalently in an increase in the exponent for the dependence of the single - chain relaxation time @xmath88 on chain length .",
    "this increase , fortuitously , approximately restores the exponent to the value 2 predicted by a simple rouse model for gaussian rings , despite the fact that our rings are partially collapsed .",
    "the breakdown of a true rouselike dynamics ( which would give @xmath144 ) for molten chains is not completely unexpected , since the rouse model describes only one chain or ring in isolation .",
    "what is remarkable from the simulation is that , for the range of masses ( of both rings and linear chains ) studied so far by bfm methods , the slowing of the center of mass motion is consistent with a picture in which each chain or ring has to drag with it the neighbors in its correlation hole against the resistance of local frictional forces ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "this very simple picture may have something to offer for understanding the diffusion of molten linear polymers in what is classically viewed as the crossover region between entangled and unentangled motion , although further work is required to check whether the same relation holds over a range of volume fractions .",
    "note that the diffusion constants and relaxation times for linear chains obtained with the bfm agree perfectly with simulations obtained with md by kremer and grest @xcite and experimental values of richter by rna @xcite ; these were always analyzed previously in terms of a crossover , although such data do not show true rouse behavior even for small @xmath44 ( and nor does the experimental data unless corrections are made for the dependence of the effective segmental mobility on chain length @xcite ) .",
    "likewise for rings one has to choose whether to assume a crossover or fit an intermediate power law to the data .",
    "the crossover interpretation is rather forced for rings , since for the ring sizes studied here , the intermediate ( apparently power - law ) behavior shows no sign of breaking down at either the small or large mass end of the range .",
    "since the nature of entanglements in ring systems remains to be clarified , it is possible that this behavior could extend to quite high masses ( or even , in principle , be the true limiting result for high @xmath44 ) . certainly if an entanglement crossover is present for rings we can say that it is at substantially higher masses than for linear chains of the same type . in",
    "the range of @xmath44 studied , there is in particular no evidence for a crossover to a regime in which the rings have exponentially long relaxation times .",
    "such behavior would anyway be surprising since even rings in a fixed network show an algebraic dependence of the diffusion constant on mass @xcite . in molten linear chains",
    ", it is known that reptation can not be the only mode of relaxation ( the prefactors predicted from the reptation picture for the diffusion coefficient and for the viscosity systematically underestimate the relaxation ) ; so there are probably enough alternative modes of motion to allow relaxation of molten rings on an algebraic timescale even in the limit of high masses .",
    "a full investigation of that limit must of course await further increases of computer power , especially since , as emphasized above , any crossover to the entangled regime occurs for substantially higher masses than in the case of linear chains .",
