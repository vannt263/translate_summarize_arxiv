    "the stopping power of ions in solids is a necessary ingredient of many areas of basic science and material technology @xcite .",
    "there are numerous detailed models to describe the response of outer electrons as a free electron gas ( feg ) @xcite . in many cases",
    "the stopping due to the feg is enough for energies reaching up to the maximum of the stopping .",
    "but for targets with the full @xmath0 or even @xmath1 subshells , the bound electron contribution plays an important role even at intermediate energies .",
    "the description of bound electrons from first principles is a heavy task , especially for multielectronic atoms ( see , for example the binary collisional formalism in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we describe the bound electron contribution to the stopping power by employing a many electron model , the shellwise local plasma approximation ( slpa ) .",
    "this is based on the local plasma approximation ( lpa ) @xcite to deal with bound electrons as an inhomogeneous free electron gas .",
    "we apply this model within the dielectric formalism kwei88,wang94,fuhr but assuming independent shell approximation archubi .",
    "this means that in the slpa the electrons of the same binding energy respond to the ion passage as a whole ( collectively ) , screening the interaction with the impinging ion .",
    "this binding energy ( or ionization gap ) is included explicitly by employing levine and louie dielectric function @xcite .",
    "the slpa allows us to calculate the different moments of the energy loss by the ion when at least one of the bound electrons is ionized .",
    "this is an _ ab initio _ calculation  no parameter is included  whose only inputs are the atomic densities of the different subshells and the corresponding binding energies",
    ". once the electronic wave functions are available , the slpa applies to the different targets with the same degree of complexity .",
    "this model has been applied successfully to describe experimental stopping cross sections of elements with @xmath2 ( using the hartree - fock wave functions and binding energies ) @xcite , and also for very heavy elements like au , pb , and bi for which numerical solutions of the dirac equation were needed @xcite .    in what follows we present our theoretical results for the stopping of protons in cu ( z=29 , [ ar ] @xmath3 ) .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to use cu as a testing case for the slpa because it is a well known element ( experimentally @xcite  and theoretically sabin89,bichsel90,denton ) , and because we can employ the known hartree - fock wave functions @xcite to obtain the subshell densities to include in the slpa .",
    "we organize this work in two steps .",
    "first , we describe briefly the theoretical calculation , and then we present results for stopping cross sections of cu for protons and compare our _ ab initio _ theoretical values with the experimental data available @xcite and with the semi - empirical srim08 results @xcite .",
    "the slpa  introduces two important differences to the known lpa .",
    "one of them is the shell  to  shell calculation .",
    "mathematically it implies a separate dielectric function for each subshell of bound electrons , and the total response as the addition of these independent contributions .",
    "physically , the electrons are screened only by those of the same binding energy and not by the rest .",
    "the second one is the explicit inclusion of the binding energy by using the levine - louie dielectric response @xcite  instead of lindhard one lindhard .",
    "this dielectric function takes into account the ionization gap so that the contribution is null if the ionization threshold is deeper than the energy transferred @xcite .",
    "the levine - louie dielectric response maintains the characteristics of lindhard @xcite ( linear response , electron - electron correlation ) , and satisfies the @xmath1-sum rule ( particle number conservation ) .",
    "more detail about the slpa can be found in refs .",
    "lizn , archubi .    for a bare ion of charge @xmath4  and velocity @xmath5 ,",
    "the stopping cross section due to the ionization of the @xmath6 subshell of target electrons , is expressed as    @xmath7\\ d\\omega , \\ ] ]    the dielectric function @xmath8  is calculated as a mean value of a local response * *  * * @xcite @xmath9=4\\pi \\int_{0}^{r_{ws}}% \\func{im}[\\frac{-1}{\\varepsilon ^{ll}(k,\\omega , \\delta _ { nl}(r),e_{nl})}]\\ r^{2}dr ,   \\label{epslpa}\\]]where @xmath10  and @xmath11 are the local density of electrons @xmath12 and ionization gap , respectively , obtained from the atomic hartree - fock tabulated by bunge _",
    "the spatial integration is performed over the atomic dimensions within the solid cu ( i.e. , @xmath13  is the atomic wigner - seitz radius , related to the atomic density @xmath14^{-1}$ ] ) .",
    "the dielectric response , given by eq .",
    "( [ epslpa ] ) , considers only the electrons in the @xmath6 subshell . in this way",
    "the contribution of each shell of target electrons is obtained separately .",
    "an orbital version of the lpa was introduced many years ago by meltzer _",
    "@xcite within the logarithmic high energy limit of the stopping number . instead ,",
    "in the slpa we calculate a dielectric response of each shell , and it is valid even in the intermediate energy range .",
    "the independent shell description in the slpa considers explicitly the energy threshold @xmath11  of each shell ( ionization of inner shells ) .",
    "the levine and louie model @xcite defines the dielectric function as    @xmath15 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cc } \\begin{array}{c } im[\\varepsilon ^{l}(q,\\omega _ { g},k_{nl}^{f}]% \\end{array } & \\begin{array}{c } \\omega >",
    "|\\epsilon _ { nl}|% \\end{array } \\\\ 0 & \\omega < |\\epsilon _ { nl}|% \\end{array}% \\right .",
    "\\label{ll}\\ ] ]    with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the usual lindhard dielectric function @xcite .",
    "this modified slpa has already been applied successfully in recent calculations of stopping power @xcite , energy loss straggling @xcite in solids , and also in multiple ionization cross sections of rare gases @xcite .",
    "in order to compare with the experimental data available we calculate total stopping cross sections . these values are obtained as the addition of the bound electron and the feg contributions .",
    "the former calculated with the slpa formalism as described before .",
    "the latter by employing the dielectric formalism with the mermin dielectric function @xcite .",
    "the characteristic plasmon frequency and width of the cu feg are @xmath18 a.u . and @xmath19 a.u .",
    "this implies a mean value of electrons in the feg @xmath20 , and a seitz radius @xmath21 a.u .. these values were obtained from the optical data of energy loss function @xcite by considering only the first important peak .",
    "the number of electrons in the feg is similar to the experimental value recommended by isaacson @xcite . to keep the total number of electrons , we considered cu as [ ar ] @xmath22 and @xmath23 electrons as feg .        in fig .",
    "[ hcu ] we plot our total stopping cross sections of cu for protons , and compare them with the experimental data available @xcite , and with srim08 results @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the feg and the bound electrons are displayed separately . about the experimental data ,",
    "we indicate separately only the data since 1980 , while previous one is plotted together with a single type of symbol .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data and with the srim08 curve is good .",
    "this is a perturbative formalism , which is not expected to describe the data for ion energies below 30 kev .",
    "however , we have obtained a very good agreement even with the measurements by valdes _",
    "@xcite  in the low energy region .",
    "the feg results obtained with the mermin dielectric function , even perturbative , are rather good for protons in cu at such low energies .",
    "figure [ hcu ] shows that the stopping maximum is correctly described in energy and value . for energies above that of the stopping maximum ,",
    "the description is good , but shows an overestimation around 2 mev .",
    "this behavior of the slpa has already been noted in previous works @xcite  and it is under study .",
    "in this work we test the _ _  ab initio _ _ slpa for the stopping of cu for protons .",
    "this is a perturbative model which works within the dielectric formalism by considering the response of bound electrons as that of a free electron gas of inhomogeneous density .",
    "the slpa introduces the independent shell approximation to the usual formalism .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with the experimental data available and with the semi empirical srim08 values , showing good agreement in a large energy region ( 5 kev-30 mev ) .",
