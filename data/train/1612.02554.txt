    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations hold the potential to achieve the highest astrometric accuracy in astronomy , provided that the fringe phase observable can be calibrated @xcite .",
    "the development of advanced phase referencing ( pr ) techniques to compensate for the tropospheric propagation errors have led to routinely achieving micro - arcsecond ( @xmath2as ) astrometry at frequencies between ca .",
    "10 and a few tens of ghz using alternating observations of the target and a nearby calibrator , which can be up to a few degrees away @xcite . the increasingly fast tropospheric fluctuations at higher frequencies set an upper threshold for application of pr techniques at @xmath343 ghz ( with but a single case at 86 ghz @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the development of phase calibration techniques using ( nearly ) simultaneous observations at multiple mm - wavelengths , that is source frequency phase referencing ( sfpr ) @xcite and multi frequency phase referencing ( mfpr ) @xcite , have extended the capability to measure @xmath2as astrometry up to mm - wavelengths .",
    "this capability for accurate astrometry has resulted in a wide applicability to many scientific problems ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless the application of these advanced pr techniques to relatively low frequencies @xmath4  ghz are hindered by the contribution of ionospheric propagation effects , increasingly dominant at lower frequencies , which have a different nature to the tropospheric effects .",
    "the unpredictability of the spatial irregularities in the plasma density in the ionosphere introduces differential path variations between the sky directions of the two sources , and propagate into systematic position errors even for small source separations .",
    "in addition , at the lowest frequencies , the temporal variations are also an issue .",
    "these both are responsible for degrading the positional accuracy achieved with this technique and , eventually , prevent the phase connection process and the use of conventional phase referencing .    therefore , a new strategy is required to overcome the limitations imposed by the ionospheric propagation medium and to reach the full potential of the instruments working on these spectral regimes , such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) that will have vlbi capability between 0.3 and 14  ghz . in general , observations which involve more than one calibrator have demonstrated advantages for astrometric vlbi at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "the alternative is the unusual configuration when a target and a strong calibrator lie within the field - of - view ( fov ) of the vlbi antennas ( i.e. an ` in - beam ' calibrator ) , and thus can be observed simultaneously @xcite .",
    "a useful variation of this combines the observations of a weak ` in - beam ' calibrator source and nodding to a strong more distant calibrator @xcite .",
    "the observations of the strong calibrator are used to remove the first - order atmospheric effects ; then the observations of the weak ` in - beam ' source , which is observed along with the target source , provide further adjustments of the spatial and temporal fluctuations , with longer coherence times .",
    "the results obtained with this approach are positive , however its widespread application is still limited by sensitivity .",
    "another useful approach is when there are two calibrators aligned with , but on opposite sides of , the target @xcite . during the observations the telescopes alternate every few minutes between the three sources , and in the analysis successive scans on the calibrators",
    "are used for the spatial and temporal interpolation to the enclosed position and scan time of the target source . the rare source configuration required for this approach to work results in limited applicability , and",
    "the calibration time overhead is large . in this paper we present results from the multiview technique which , by deriving 2d phase screens from observations of three or more calibrators , achieves a superior mitigation of atmospheric errors that results in increased precision astrometry , along with wide applicability by relaxing the constraints on the angular separation up to few degrees , and does not require alignment of sources .",
    "the scope of application is for the low frequency regime where the perfomance of pr is degraded due to the spatial structure of the ionospheric dominant errors .",
    "it is a development of the `` cluster  cluster '' vlbi technique , which allowed simultaneous observations of a target and multiple calibrators around it by replacing single telescopes by sites with multiple elements @xcite .",
    "the ability of the `` cluster  cluster '' technique to address the ionospheric effects has been demonstrated with joint observations between connected interferometer arrays at 1.6 ghz of a target and three calibrator sources @xcite . despite these benefits its use has been limited by the shortage of compatible observing sites , and the complexity in its implementation .",
    "we revisit this technique in the light of the next generation of instruments for low frequency observations that will become operational in the course of the next decade .",
    "these have the multi - beam capability as an `` in - built '' feature , such as the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) in the near future , and ska in the longer term .",
    "we believe that the implementation of multiview techniques will enhance the performance of vlbi observations , by providing higher precision astrometric measurements of many targets at low frequencies .    in this paper",
    "we describe the observations in section  [ sec : obs ] ; the basis of the multiview technique in section  [ sec : meth ] ; section  [ sec : res ] presents a demonstration and quantifies its astrometric capabilities , along with a comparative study with outcomes from conventional pr techniques for a range of target  calibrator angular separations , including in - beam phase referencing , using vlba observations at 1.6 ghz ; section  [ sec : disc ] are discussions and conclusions .",
    "in an effort to demonstrate the improvements by multiview calibration over conventional techniques , we conducted two epochs of observations with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) separated by one month , on 2015 june 8 ( epoch i , obs . i d :  bo047a7 ) and july 7 ( epoch ii , obs .",

    "we conclude that greater improvements are expected from increased sensitivity , and faster duty cycles , with maximum benefits from simultaneous observations and closer source distribution , to minimize the non - linear deviations of the actual ionospheric spatial structure above each antenna from a planar surface .",

    "it is a ska goal to achieve @xmath27as astrometric accuracy at a single epoch of observations at @xmath281.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity and long baselines of ska vlbi observations will result in a much reduced thermal noise level and high spatial resolution .",

    "this puts a very tight limit on the number of available calibrator sources , even at the ska sensitivities @xcite .",
    "this constraint on the angular separation can be significantly relaxed , by using multiple calibrator sources and mv techniques , as suggested by the demonstration presented in this paper and our previous simulation studies .",
    "additionally , the multi - beam capability of ska will allow for simultaneous observations of all sources and therefore eliminate the errors arising from short term phase fluctuations , which result in a reduction of the coherence losses ( i.e. characterized by ffr quantity ) and the thermal noise errors , while improving the overall performance .",
    "this applies to other instruments with multibeam systems such as askap and westerbork synthesis radio telescope with apertif , among others .",
    "our demonstration includes three calibrators ; note that the more calibrators the better , as this will allow the most accurate reconstruction of the atmospheric effects .",

    "scientific applications using such a group of sources applied to studies with the ska of the nearby universe , including the milky way galaxy and the local group of galaxies are described in @xcite . although that case - study report discussed the scientific applications conservatively based on only ` in - beam ' pr astrometry , our results indicate that mv would provide further benefits .",

    "10s of arcminutes away @xcite .",

    "hence , using three calibrators within the ska - mid antenna beams and mv will result in a further increase by one order of magnitude of the astrometric precision , extrapolating from our comparative study .",
    "in general , allowing for larger angular separations makes it possible to select good calibrator sources , which are fundamental for multi - epoch studies . with the higher probabilities of finding suitable calibrators",
    "the general applicability is also highly increased . in some cases , such as pulsar observations in the galactic plane",
    ", it might even be desirable to use calibrators out of the plane to reduce the effect of scattering",

    "high precision astrometry observations of methanol masers at 6.7 ghz holds the prospect to contribute to the successful program for 3-d mapping of our galaxy , as a complement to the precise water maser measurements @xcite .",
    "however the advanced pr strategies used at 22 ghz , in the tropospheric dominated regime , fail to provide high precision astrometry at 6.7 ghz , as this is in the ionospheric dominated regime . therefore mv with fast source switching between sources , or simultaneous observations if possible , provides a strategy for superior calibration of the tropospheric and ionospheric errors resulting in precise astrometry .",
