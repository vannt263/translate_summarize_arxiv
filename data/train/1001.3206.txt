    "since the beginning of research on multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems , there has been a growing interest in the construction of low complexity space - time coding ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , high rate and low complexity are so far limited to two transmit antennas @xcite , whereas for higher number of transmitters , the constructed codes are either low rate ( like orthogonal or quasi - orthogonal designs @xcite ) , have long delays ( e.g. , @xcite ) or have a considerable higher complexity than the orthogonal designs @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the threaded algebraic space - time ( tast ) framework , proposed by the authors in @xcite and which is shown to comprise most full diversity codes ( e.g. , orthogonal designs , codes from cyclic division algebra , etc .",
    "the tast codes are full rate , full diversity and decodable by algorithms that search trees for shortest paths such as sequential decoding .",
    "the tree of the coded mimo system is usually constructed via qr decomposition of the composite channel and code matrix @xcite . within the tast framework",
    ", we investigate here the construction of codes that facilitate tree - searching decoding algorithms by simplifying the tree structure of the new proposed tast codes .    for our purposes ,",
    "we consider a space - time block code @xmath0 over @xmath1 transmit antennas and @xmath2 channel uses .",
    "the code words of @xmath3 $ ] are @xmath4 matrices in which the @xmath5-th entry @xmath6 denotes the modulated code symbol transmitted from the @xmath7-th transmit antenna at the @xmath8-th symbol periods .",
    "if all nontrivial pairwise differences between code word matrices are full rank ( i.e. , of rank @xmath1 ) over the complex numbers @xmath9 , then the space - time code is said to achieve full diversity .    in this work ,",
    "the transmitted symbols are generated from some finite constellations using algebraic constructions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the two - dimensional quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) alphabet , and let @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 , denote the field of complex rational numbers .",
    "we let choose @xmath13 be an extension field of degree @xmath14 $ ] over the base field @xmath15 that contains @xmath10 .",
    "the rate of the code @xmath16 is defined as the number of complex symbols from @xmath10 transmitted per channel use .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tast ]",
    "we review the construction methodology of the tast framework and we present our new construction in section [ st - tast ] before concluding in section [ conc ] .",
    "the basic idea of the tast framework is to divide the space - time matrix into several threads ( i.e. , permutation matrices or concatenation of permutation matrices ) and then assign a different full diversity siso encoder to each thread . that makes",
    "each thread achieves full diversity in the absence of the other threads .",
    "then , to achieve full diversity of the total code , one needs to project each siso encoder into a different algebraic subspace by multiplying its elements by some roots of unity @xcite .",
    "the threaded code structure was introduced by el gamal and hammons @xcite as a generalization of the layers proposed by foschini @xcite . in the aforementioned framework ,",
    "a _ layer _ is a function that assigns a unique transmit antenna to be used during the symbol intervals that are available over a code word interval .",
    "a layer is called a _ thread _ if the domain of the function includes all possible symbol intervals and its range includes all possible transmit antennas ( i.e. , a thread exploits all the spatial diversity of a mimo system ) . for example , a mimo system with @xmath1 transmit antennas and a code word interval of duration @xmath2 symbols allows the simultaneous transmission of @xmath1 different threads .",
    "an example of the threaded layering set @xmath17 is given in the following equation ( with the convention that time indices span @xmath18 $ ] ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the mod-@xmath1 operation .",
    "then , a tast code consists of sending different siso encoders into different threads .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 , full diversity full rate tast codes can be constructed using the following siso encoders @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an @xmath24 full diversity constellation rotation , @xmath25 is an @xmath26 an information symbol vector with components from a given qam constellation and @xmath27 are some roots of unity that are algebraically independent over the number field containing the rotations @xmath28 .",
    "the tast framework contains most of the known full diversity space - time codes , such as orthogonal designs and codes from cyclic division algebra for example @xcite .",
    "an example of tast codes is the golden code ( or its variant matrix c in the wimax standards ) @xmath29 , \\\\   \\nonumber \\phantom{{{\\,\\,\\stackrel{\\scriptscriptstyle \\bigtriangleup}{=}\\,\\ , } } } u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \\in \\ , \\mbox{qam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a shaping coefficient in order to make the mapping unitary @xcite .",
    "consider a tast code with rate @xmath34 complex symbols per channel use , i.e. , each @xmath35 qam information symbol vector @xmath36 is associated with an @xmath4 code word matrix @xmath37 .",
    "when transmitting the tast code word @xmath37 over a mimo channel , the baseband received signal can be written in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 channel matrix with i.i.d rayleigh fading coefficients and @xmath41 is an @xmath42 matrix representing the additive white gaussian noise with i.i.d .",
    "components . writing the received signal in a vector form",
    "gives @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 identity matrix , @xmath46 is the kronicker product , @xmath47 is the equivalent @xmath48 code matrix such that @xmath49 . maximum likelihood ( ml ) or near - ml decoding can then be done using qr decomposition on the composite @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 followed by sphere decoding or other type of sequential decoding algorithms that search for the shortest path on a tree such as the m - algorithm @xcite . since the complexity of the qr decomposition is cubic in the matrix dimension , it can be prohibitive for large values of @xmath2 and @xmath52 ( e.g. , for full rate minimum delay tast codes , @xmath21 and @xmath53 ) . in the next section ,",
    "we propose a new construction of tast codes that simplifies the qr decomposition of @xmath51 by designing @xmath47 to be in an upper triangular form ( note that the qr decomposition of @xmath54 requires only the decomposition of the @xmath40 channel matrix @xmath39 ) .",
    "the new codes use the threading in for @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a non negative integer that allows more tradeoff between complexity and rate as explained in the sequel .",
    "we encode @xmath57 qam information symbols , @xmath58 into an @xmath4 code word matrix @xmath59 . in order to have an upper triangular equivalent code matrix",
    ", each siso encoder creates an isi - like channel in each thread . for simplicity of presentation",
    ", the code construction is explained first for @xmath60 ( i.e. , @xmath61 , and @xmath53 ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be a full diversity , full rate @xmath24 optimized tast code ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then the new tast code is constructed as follows .",
    "the first @xmath24 block of the new code is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64-th column of matrix @xmath65 .",
    "that is , at each symbol period , @xmath1 new qam symbols enter the encoder until a total of @xmath66 symbols are encoded .",
    "the second and last @xmath67 block is given by @xmath68 that is , at each symbol period , @xmath1 symbols that appeared @xmath1 times each in the code , exit the encoder .",
    "for example , for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , using the golden code as the constituent code , one has @xmath71,\\ ] ] with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 as in .",
    "the rate of this code is @xmath76 complex symbols per channel use and it is easy to show that it achieves full diversity .",
    "the equivalent code matrix @xmath47 is upper triangular as can be seen from transforming @xmath59 into a vector by stacking its columns one after the other .",
    "@xmath77    to increase the rate while keeping the upper - triangular property of the equivalent code matrix @xmath47 and the full diversity of the code , one can add @xmath56 columns between the first and last block of the new tast code , where for each added column , @xmath1 symbols exit the @xmath1 siso encoders and @xmath1 new qam symbols enter such that each of the @xmath52 qam symbols * appears exactly in * @xmath1 places * in only one * of the @xmath1 thread . for example , for the above code with @xmath78 , one obtains    @xmath79,\\ ] ]    which has a rate of @xmath80 .",
    "the general construction is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a @xmath35 qam information symbol vector @xmath36 is encoded into an @xmath4 space - time code word matrix @xmath59 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath56 a non negative integer .",
    "the new @xmath4 tast code @xmath83 is based on concatenating the columns of a constituent @xmath24 full diversity and full rate tast code @xmath65 such that in the code word matrix @xmath83 , the columns of @xmath65 are repeated cyclically , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "3 .   after the first @xmath1 columns given in",
    ", one can add @xmath56 columns to increase the rate and then one requires @xmath85 columns for termination ( in order to guarantee the same diversity level for all the symbols )",
    ". the addition of extra columns respects the following rule : * each qam symbol should appear exactly in @xmath1 positions in only one thread . * mathematically , the @xmath86-th added column with @xmath87 is of the form @xmath88 where at each columns , @xmath1 symbols that already appeared @xmath1 times each exit the encoder and @xmath1 new symbols enter . 4 .",
    "the last @xmath85 columns are for termination where no new symbols enter the code and @xmath85 blocks of @xmath1 symbols exit the encoder ( @xmath1 symbols at each column ) : @xmath89    note that the space - time code @xmath90 takes input vector of length @xmath66 , and therefore , the number of zero elements in @xmath91 using the above notations equal @xmath66 minus the number of nonzero elements .",
    "one has the following .",
    "the new tast code constructed as above over @xmath1 transmit antennas and @xmath82 transmission intervals has a rate of @xmath92 symbols per channel use and achieves full diversity whenever the constituent tast code achieves full diversity .    to prove full diversity",
    ", we consider the rank of the difference between distinct code word matrices , @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "equivalently , we can consider @xmath59 with @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath95 , it follows that at least one @xmath96 is nonzero . by construction , each @xmath96 appears exactly in @xmath1 positions along one thread in @xmath83 .",
    "now , consider the square @xmath24 submatrix that contains those positions of @xmath96 . by construction , it is the constituent tast matrix @xmath65 ( up to a column permutation ) .",
    "since the constituent tast code achieves full diversity , it follows that the rank of the considered submatrix equals @xmath1 and the new tast code @xmath83 achieves full diversity .",
    "the following example illustrates the idea of creating an isi - channel in each thread in order to achieve diversity while reducing detection complexity .",
    "let @xmath97 giving @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 some qam constellation in @xmath101 $ ] , the ring of gaussian integers .",
    "further , let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be the corresponding diophantine numbers of the tast construction @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath102 are algebraically independent over @xmath103 and @xmath104 are algebraically independent over @xmath105 ) . then",
    ", the following construction is one example of a simplified tree - structured tast code : @xmath106 note that each symbol @xmath96 , @xmath107 appears exactly @xmath108 times in one of the @xmath109 threads , guaranteeing thus its full diversity level . under this representation ,",
    "the simplified tree - structured tast code can be considered as a finite - state machine ( i.e. , convolutional encoder over the complex numbers field ) where the first thread is generated by the convolutional encoder @xmath110 , the second thread by @xmath111 and the third thread by @xmath112 .",
    "note also that , similar to the fractional rate loss in convolutional codes due to equal error protection , we have a fractional rate loss that vanishes when the block length increases .",
    "the main property of the new codes is that the equivalent code matrix @xmath47 is upper triangular which is easily shown form the construction method .",
    "this largely simplifies the qr decomposition of the composite channel and code matrix @xmath113 which is essential to ml detection using sphere or sequential decoding or other sub - optimal near - ml decoding algorithms such as the babai decoder @xcite .",
    "this reduction in complexity is achieved at the expense of rate reduction .",
    "while the constituent tast code has a full rate of @xmath1 symbols per channel use , the new construction achieves a rate of @xmath92 , which only asymptotically tends to the full rate when @xmath56 increases .    as for the other code properties , such as peak - to - average power ratio or the coding gain",
    ", the new construction inherits the properties of the constituent tast code . in particular",
    ", one can show that if the constituent tast code @xmath65 has a non - vanishing determinant ( nvd ) then the new construction @xmath83 also has the nvd property .",
    "this can be seen from the construction of @xmath83 where it has to contain ( up to column permutations ) the submatrix @xmath65 with at least one nonzero thread , which gives the nvd property . while the new codes are not dmt optimal for finite @xmath56 due to their rate loss , using the nvd property",
    ", one can show their optimality in the limit of @xmath56 .",
    "the new tast codes with simplified tree structures inherit other desirable properties form their tast brethren such as their availability for any number of transmit and receive antennas , any channel - state information at the receiver and transmitter and any input alphabets @xcite .",
    "finally , note that one can increase the rate ( while keeping the upper triangular form of @xmath47 ) by cutting the termination tail of @xmath85 columns in @xmath83 , in which case one obtains unequal error protection ( that results from unequal diversity levels ) for the different qam symbols .",
    "except as noted to the contrary , we employ bpsk modulation in all our simulations .",
    "simulation results presents the degradation in complexity achieved through the proposed codes over the original tast codes in both stages , the preprocessing stage ( represented in the qr decomposition ) and the tree search stage ( represented in the number of nodes visited by the fano decoder ) .",
    "unless specified otherwise , the diophantine numbers are chosen according to @xcite to be algebraic integers such that the tast code achieves full diversity .",
    "fig  [ nodes_vs_k ] and  [ nodes_vs_snr ] show the reduction in complexity in the search stage achieved by the proposed tree codes over the original tast codes which is clear especially for large block lengths and also at low snr .",
    "this is because of the sparsity of the composite @xmath114 matrix which facilitates the role of the fano decoder .",
    "+ fig  [ qr_vs_k ] shows the main reduction in complexity in the preprocessing stage ( the qr decomposition ) .",
    "this was mainly achieved by applying qr decomposition through givens rotations which introduces one zero at a time which helps in investing the ready zeros in the tall upper - triangular composite matrix @xmath114 .",
    "the exact number of flops needed per decoded symbol is calculated to be @xmath115k + [ \\frac{n - m}{2m}]k^2 $ ] .",
    "so , it s obvious that at @xmath116 , the number of flops required per decoded symbol reduces to @xmath117 which is of @xmath118 instead of @xmath119 for the original tast codes .",
    "the figure shows this linear relation with the block length .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new methodology for constructing tast codes with simplified tree structure .",
    "the new codes have the interesting property of upper triangular equivalent code matrix which simplifies the subsequent tree search algorithms such as sequential decoders .",
    "the complexity reduction comes at a price of a fractional rate loss , when compared to the full rate tast codes , that vanishes when the block size increases .",
    "the proposed codes present an interesting compromise between rate and complexity which situates them as an attractive alternative of low rate low complexity orthogonal and quasi - orthogonal designs and high - rate high complexity tast codes or codes from cyclic division algebra .",
    "further simplification of the proposed codes is under consideration as well as their extension to distributed relay network @xcite .",
