    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , much of the theoretical work to date has focussed on modeling individual emission line profiles ( at high resolution ) and the overall spectral energy distributions ( at low resolution ) of cttss , with relatively little emphasis on the fluxes and flux ratios of a series of emission lines .",
    "only recently have the relative strengths of the higher order members of various h series been combined with their stronger counterparts to estimate the density and temperature of the emission regions in cttss @xcite and thereby constrain theoretical models .",
    "a complication in carrying out such comparisons of relative line fluxes to model predictions arises from the notorious variability of the spectra of cttss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and therefore the need to acquire spectra covering all useful lines simultaneously .",
    "consequently , the location and physical conditions of the h line emitting regions are not well constrained observationally .    at a distance of @xmath14 51 pc @xcite ,",
    "tw hya is one of the nearest t tauri stars .",
    "although it is a member of a small group of stars known as the tw hydra association ( twa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tw hya resides surprisingly far from any known molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite originally identified this object as a possible post - t tauri star with a spectral class of k7 ve .",
    "however , its optical spectrum exhibits a very strong and variable h@xmath11 emission line and emission lines of he i , [ ] , , and , features that suggest that it is a ctts @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that tw hya was a strong iras source , suggesting that it is surrounded by a dusty accretion disk .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite , who found tw hya to be a strong sub - millimeter source . the accretion disk around tw hya was subsequently directly imaged at various wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and is seen approximately face - on .",
    "analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of tw hya has indicated that the system contains a so - called  transitional disk \" @xcite with two separate components : a largely dust free , optically thin , hot , inner region , extending from @xmath14 0.06 - 4 au @xcite , and a cold outer region extending to a radius of @xmath14 200 au .",

    "the later spectral type implies a much cooler stellar temperature , and hence a much younger age than usually adopted .",
    "subtraction of a scaled , matching spectral template from our spectrum reveals numerous ( primarily h ) emission features . because the spectra simultaneously cover both the pa and br series , we avoid the ambiguity introduced by temporal variability of the line fluxes and we use the relative line fluxes to determine the physical conditions of the emitting gas .",
    "the derived temperature , density , and thickness of the emission region are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of magnetospheric accretion models .",

    "a set of internal flat fields and arc frames were obtained immediately after the observations of tw hya for flat fielding and wavelength calibration purposes .",
    "the data were reduced using spextool @xcite , the idl - based package developed for the reduction of spex data .",
    "the spextool package performs non - linearity corrections , flat fielding , image pair subtraction , aperture definition , optimal extraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "the sets of spectra resulting from the individual exposures were median combined and then corrected for telluric absorption and flux calibrated using the extracted a0 v telluric standard spectra and the technique and software described by @xcite .",
    "the spectra from the individual orders were then spliced together by matching the flux levels in the overlapping wavelength regions , and regions of poor atmospheric transmission were removed .",
    "the final sxd and lxd spectra were merged by scaling the sxd spectra by 1.05 in order to match the flux levels of the lxd data in the region of wavelength overlap between 2.2 and 2.4 @xmath2 m and then computing a weighted average .",
    "the weights were determined from the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) values in the two spectra . the final @xmath1 @xmath2 m spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the s / n varies across the spectral range ; it is of the order of several hundred across the sxd wavelength range , @xmath28 across the @xmath29 @xmath2 m range and about @xmath30 in the @xmath31 @xmath2 m range .",
    "we computed synthetic nir magnitudes in various filters from our final spectrum .",
    "the estimated 2mass magnitudes are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "comparison with the 2mass point source catalogue indicates that our synthetic magnitudes are systematically lower by @xmath35% .",
    "given the variable nature of tw hya , it is not clear if this difference reflects a real change in the source brightness or a systematic error in our absolute flux calibration .",
    "however our synthetic @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors agree to within 0.02 mags with the 2mass values , which indicates that our relative flux calibration is very accurate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* where it is demonstrated that the adopted method of flux calibration produces spectra with relative fluxes accurate to a few percent ) .",
    "although a spectral type as early as k6ve has been given for tw hya @xcite , the most commonly quoted spectral type for this object is k7ve following @xcite .",
    "however , determinations of the spectral type of t tauri stars based on optical spectra can be biased by the substantial excess optical continuum produced by the accretion process ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as any differential extinction due to dust either locally or along the line of sight . in the nir ,",
    "however , the contribution from the excess continuum is believed to be small for most cttss , and this spectral region is much less affected by dust than the optical , while still containing numerous diagnostic lines that can be used for spectral classification . with the recent publication of the irtf spectral library @xcite , it is possible to re - evaluate the spectral types for cttss by directly comparing their nir spectra with those for a large stellar sample .",
    "therefore , we have re - examined the spectral type for tw hya based on our spex spectrum , which was obtained with the same instrumentation and reduced in exactly the same manner as those in the irtf spectral library .",
    "we attempted to determine the spectral classification of tw hya using a variety of methods .",
    "comparison of the overall shape @xmath1 @xmath2 m spectrum of tw hya ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) with those presented in the irtf spectral library @xcite immediately suggests that this object has a spectral type between m1v and m4v , and certainly later than k7v .",
    "in particular , the broad shallow absorption at @xmath38 m , due to tio bandheads , and the prominent continuum ` bumps ' in the h and k bands , due to water absorption at the edges of the bands at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 m , suggest a spectral type later than about m1.5v but earlier than about m3.5v ( see * ? ? ?",
    "such a comparison should not be affected by extinction along the line of sight to tw hya because , at a distance of only 51 pc and a location well outside of any molecular cloud , as well as a nearly pole - on orientation , tw hya is believed to have @xmath42 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  3.2 below ) .",
    "furthermore , the m stars in the irtf spectral library either have zero extinction or their spectra have been corrected for extinction .",
    "nevertheless , t tauri stars are known to exhibit  veiling \" , in which emission from the surrounding accretion disk provides additional flux above that of the photosphere in the ir , while the accretion shock contributes additional flux in the uv / optical to the total spectrum from the object .",
    "as tw hya is a  transitional disk \" system , the nir veiling is believed to be rather low ( @xmath43% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  3.3 below ) .",
    "even if the veiling were substantial , the smooth excess flux spectrum expected from the disk emission should not produce the broad absorption features that characterize the spectra of early m subtypes .",
    "we then independently examined various spectral regions , and compared them with the corresponding regions of the spectra in the irtf spectral library .",
    "we carried out this comparison both `` by eye '' and using a least - squares fitting procedure ( to determine the best - fit scaling for each spectrum in the irtf spectral library ) .",
    "as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] , both the spectral slope and the depths of various spectral features in the @xmath44 @xmath2 m region indicate that tw hya has a spectral type between m1v and m3v . in particular , the presence of weak tio bands at @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath2 m , a weak absorption due to feh at @xmath47 @xmath2 m , and the absorption feature due to h@xmath48o at 1.33 @xmath2 m suggest a spectral type of early m , rather than k. a similar result",
    "is found for the k - band region ( fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] ) , in which the spectral shape of tw hya appears to be very similar to that of an m2.5v star . for the h - band ,",
    "however , we find a slight disagreement between the spectral shape , which indicates a spectral type of m2v or later , and the strengths of various discrete features ( particularly the complex of fe and si lines between 1.60 and 1.65 @xmath2 m ) , which indicate a spectral type of @xmath14 m1v .",
    "the @xmath49 comparison over the wavelength region between 0.95 and 1.34 @xmath2 m ( where veiling is expected to be minimal ; see below ) yields low @xmath49 values for the m0.5v , m1.5v , m2.5v , and m3v spectra from the library , with a formal best match with the m1.5v spectrum .",
    "however , the overall spectrum does not match that of the m0.5v star and the shape of the k band spectral region does not match that of the m1.5v star .",
    "there is very little difference between the m2.5v and m3v spectra .",
    "we also measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of numerous features in our spectrum and compared them with values determined from direct measurements of the spectra of k and m stars available in the irtf spectral library @xcite .",
    "( since our spectrum has the same resolution and comparable s / n as those in the irtf spectral library , a comparison with these values should provide a better indication of the spectral type than those given by other authors with different stellar libraries . ) the ews of some of these absorption features ( due to , , , , and feh ) in the spectrum of tw hya are presented in table [ abslines ] . a comparison between a subset of these values deemed to be the most sensitive diagnostics of spectral type and those derived in an identical manner from the k and m stars in irtf spectral library",
    "is shown in figure [ fig3 ] as a function of spectral type . in this figure ,",
    "the horizontal dashed lines denote the range in the ew ( @xmath50 ) for tw hya .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , particularly the feh and @xmath51 m ews , clearly suggest a spectral type of m2.5v - m3.5v for tw hya .    because of veiling",
    ", one must be careful in interpreting the ews as spectral type diagnostics : lines may appear to be too weak simply because of the additional continuum flux from the disk . therefore , the effect of veiling on a spectral type determination depends on the trend of the ew of a feature with spectral type for normal stars .",
    "if the ew of a feature decreases with spectral type , veiling will cause a feature to appear weaker and will result in a later spectral classification . if the ew increases with spectral type , veiling will result in an earlier spectral classification .",
    "however , veiling can not produce lines that are too _ strong _ for a given spectral type .",
    "furthermore , the veiling in tw hya is expected to be negligible in the y and j bands @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we relied primarily on the diagnostic lines in these bands and on those lines whose strength increases with later spectral type .",
    "the latter set of lines should yield a limit on the spectral type .",
    "nevertheless , even for the h and k bands , the effect of veiling on the spectral type we determine from the ews should be small .",
    "the true ew ( @xmath52 ) can be computed from the observed ew ( @xmath53 ) with @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the veiling value .",
    "@xcite give a k band veiling value for tw hya of @xmath56 .",
    "even a correction of 10% to the observed ew values will not yield a spectral type substantially different from what we determine from the observed ( uncorrected ) ews .",
    "furthermore , such an increase in the ews will tend to yield later , not earlier , spectral types from the most sensitive lines .",
    "the effects of veiling can be mitigated to a large extent by considering pairs of closely spaced diagnostic lines sensitive to spectral class .",
    "the ratio of the ews of two such lines is given by @xmath57 we can express the veiling of one line in terms of the other @xmath58 and if the lines are suitably close in wavelength then @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 and the observed ew ratios will reflect the true ews .",
    "if this ratio is sensitive to spectral type , it can be used to classify the star . fig .",
    "[ ewratio ] demonstrates the use of this technique for tw hya using the 1.14 @xmath2 m and 1.18@xmath2 m lines .",
    "this figure demonstrates again that the spectral type for tw hya is approximately m2.5v , independent of any possible veiling . the agreement between this determination and that derived from the individual lines demonstrates that the veiling around 1 @xmath2 m must be negligible in tw hya .",
    "based on the results of these three comparison methods , we conclude that tw hya has a spectral type of m2.5v or m3v , with a possible range between m1.5 v and m3.5 v. for this spectral type , the calibrations for m stars given by @xcite and @xcite yield an effective temperature of @xmath61 k and a mass of @xmath62 . to estimate the stellar radius , we adopted the 2mass j band magnitude of 8.22 , a distance of 51 pc , and the j - band bolometric corrections from the @xcite models to compute the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the radius was then determined from @xmath63 with this procedure , we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the derived luminosity is in good agreement with other estimates ( @xmath66 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen in fig .  1 , the nir spectrum of tw hya consists of numerous emission lines atop a photospheric spectrum .",
    "the emission lines presumably arise from the accretion process .",
    "we generated the spectrum of this emission component by scaling the spectrum of an m2.5v star ( gl 381 ) from the irtf spectral library to that of tw hya and subtracting it .",
    "the scale factor was determined to be 0.29 via a least squares calculation between 0.95 and 1.34 @xmath2 m .",
    "this wavelength region was chosen for two reasons : ( 1 ) as stated above , previous investigations have found that the veiling in the y band ( i.e. , around 1 @xmath2 m ) is negligible @xcite ; ( 2 ) matching a library spectrum at any longer or shorter wavelengths resulted in substantial regions with negative ` excess ' fluxes and veiling factors . since the extinction toward tw hya is negligible , the latter result is not physically justified .",
    "the result of the subtraction of the scaled m2.5v template spectrum is shown at the bottoms of figs .",
    "[ fig2a]-[fig2d ] .",
    "numerous lines of the hydrogen paschen ( pa ) , brackett ( br ) , pfund ( pf ) , and humphreys ( hu ) series , as well as emission lines of and appear in the subtracted spectrum .",
    "we see no evidence of the h@xmath48 emission at 2.1218 @xmath2 m reported by @xcite .",
    "the measured line fluxes are presented in table [ emisslines ] .",
    "we now discuss the properties of the h , he , and o lines .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    as shown by @xcite for a sample of 15 classical t tauri stars and by @xcite for the case of tw hya itself , the relative h line strengths in the spectra of these objects can be well reproduced with the case b recombination approximation . although the relative line strengths within any given series can be used to estimate the temperature and density of the emitting region , a more sensitive diagnostic is provided by the inter - series ratios of line strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we computed the flux of each line relative to that of pa @xmath12 , the strongest line in our spectrum .",
    "we then used the theoretical h line fluxes for case b as provided by @xcite and @xcite to compute the corresponding line ratios for electron temperatures between 500 and 30000 k and electron densities between @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath7 .",
    "for each temperature and density pair we computed a @xmath49 value between the theoretical and observed line ratios .",
    "contours of the @xmath49 values are shown in fig .",
    "[ chicont ] .",
    "the minimum @xmath49 was found for @xmath69k and @xmath70 @xmath7 and the corresponding theoretical line ratios for these values are plotted along with the observed line flux ratios as a function of upper level quantum number in fig [ lineratio ] .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ chicont ] , the electron temperature is not tightly constrained by the line ratios and we find that any temperature @xmath5 k can provide an adequate representation of the data points . for temperatures @xmath71",

    "we also plot in fig [ lineratio ] the theoretical values for @xmath74 k and @xmath75 @xmath7 derived by @xcite .",
    "this comparison clearly demonstrates that the values found by @xcite can not reproduce the observed line ratios for tw hya .",
    "we also analyzed the h line strengths seen in the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of tw hya presented by @xcite in the same manner . because of the large error bars and relatively few data points , the h flux ratios relative to hu@xmath11 in the sh2 spectrum provide only weak constraints on the electron temperature and density .",
    "although the formal best fit for the sh2 line fluxes is found for @xmath76 k and @xmath77 @xmath7 , there is very little difference between the theoretical line flux ratios for this set of parameters and the values we found from our nir line analysis . for the sh1 spectrum of @xcite ,",
    "the best fit was found for @xmath78 k and @xmath75 @xmath7 , close to the values advocated by @xcite .    as stated above",
    ", it is the combination of multiple h line series that provide the strongest constraints on the temperature and density . with just the pa h series alone ,",
    "for example , it would be nearly impossible to distinguish lines produced in a region with @xmath79 @xmath7 from those produced in a region with @xmath70 @xmath7 .",
    "however , the fluxes of the h lines in the spectra of t tauri stars are known to vary , and our lxd data were not acquired simultaneously with the sxd data ( the time difference was almost exactly 24 hours ) . therefore , we also carried out our analysis using only the pa and br lines in our sxd 0.8 - 2.5 @xmath2 m spectrum .",
    "we obtained results similar to those given above : a temperature of @xmath80 k and a density @xmath81 @xmath7 provided the best fit in this case , but @xmath69 k , and @xmath70 @xmath7 were nearly equally acceptable .",
    "this , along with the fact that the observed flux levels of the sxd and lxd spectra differed by only 5% between the two nights , suggests that tw hya did not vary substantially between the two observations , and confirms the results found by including the pf lines in the analysis .",
    "we note that the h line strengths in the spectrum of tw hya obtained by @xcite in 2008 are only about 15 - 20% larger than the values we measure .",

    "the 1.083 @xmath2 m profile in their spectrum exhibits a considerably stronger emission peak , a somewhat shallower p cygni absorption trough , and almost no evidence of the red absorption feature .",
    "this change in the line profile suggests a denser outflow during the observations of @xcite , which would be consistent with their somewhat stronger h lines .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    as discussed by @xcite and summarized by @xcite , the permitted lines seen in the spectrum of tw hya can arise from recombination , fluorescence excited by the stellar continuum , or resonance fluorescence excited by ly @xmath12 . because continuum fluorescence should generate an 0.8446 @xmath2 m line that is considerably stronger than the 1.1287 @xmath2 m line , while the observations indicate that these two lines have approximately equal strength , this excitation mechanism can be ruled out . the relative line strengths produced by recombination can be derived from the volume emission coefficients , @xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137 because and have very similar ionization potentials , we might expect o and h to have similar spatial distributions and ionization fractions in the emission regions . in this case , the strength of the 0.8446 @xmath2 m line relative to pa @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath138 this is provides an upper limit to the flux ratio because it assumes all the o is in the form of ; some o may be in and higher ionization stages .",
    "extrapolating the effective recombination coefficients of @xcite for to electron temperatures of @xmath139 k , and using the h line emissivities given by @xcite and a solar oxygen abundance @xcite , we estimate line strength ratios resulting from recombination of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the observed line ratios are found to be @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "although it could be argued that the former ratio could be affected by reddening , which could be responsible for reducing the observed ratio below the expected value , the latter ratio is already @xmath144 times stronger than predicted and would only increase with any corrections for reddening .",
    "furthermore , to bring the former line ratio into agreement with the predictions would require a reddening correction corresponding to @xmath145 , which seems far too large for tw hya .",
    "therefore , under the assumption that the h and emission lines are generated in the same region , we can rule out recombination as the source of the emission .",
    "this leaves fluorescence by ly @xmath12 as the excitation mechanism for the lines .",
    "this mechanism should produce equal numbers of photons in the 0.8446 and 1.1287 @xmath2 m lines , which is exactly what we observe .",
    "the fact that we do observe equal numbers of photons in the lines again confirms that there is no differential reddening along the line of sight to the emitting region and very little dust within the emission region itself , as found previously by many others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the excess at longer wavelengths could be due to the thermal emission from the accretion disk , either the optically thick disk at @xmath149 au @xcite or an optically thin inner disk @xcite .",
    "however , the excess spectrum can not be fit with any simple disk model ; the model of @xcite is shown as a dotted line in this panel and clearly does not match the shape of the derived spectrum , greatly underestimating the flux in the h and k bands and overestimating the flux at longer wavelengths .",
    "the peak in the excess flux spectrum in the h band requires a dust temperature of @xmath150 k , but optically thin dust disk models , with power law distributions for the temperature and surface density , generally can not reproduce the sharp drop off in flux on either side of this peak that is seen in our data .",
    "an ` excess flux ' spectrum that peaks in the h band is very reminiscent of the spectral difference observed between late type giants and dwarfs .",

    "[ giant_dwarf ] we plot the ` excess ' spectrum derived by scaling the spectrum of an m2.5v star to that of an m2.5iii star , both taken from the irtf spectral library , over the wavelength range @xmath152 m , and subtracting the former from the latter .",
    "the resulting difference spectrum was then scaled to match the level of the h band excess in the spectrum of tw hya and overplotted on the tw hya excess spectrum . as can be seen from this figure ,",

    "therefore , we believe the tw hya h and k band excess is in fact not indicative of disk emission , but rather is a signature of tw hya s youth ( relative to field m dwarfs ) , as it contracts and evolves down to the main sequence . this conjecture might be tested with higher resolution observations of atomic absorption lines , whose widths would reflect the value of @xmath155 , in much the same manner as described by @xcite for l dwarfs .",
    "if the excess could be calibrated as a function of @xmath155 , it could provide a separate estimate of the age of the system .    under the assumption that the excess spectrum is due to emission arising from the accretion process",
    ", the ratio of the excess spectrum to the library template yields the veiling @xmath55 . as seen in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ veilplot ] , the veiling derived from the m2.5v spectral template is fairly small : @xmath156% between 0.8 and 0.9 @xmath2 m , @xmath157% between 1.4 and 1.8 @xmath2 m , @xmath18% between 2.0 and 2.4 @xmath2 m , and @xmath158% between 3.0 and 4.0 @xmath2 m .",
    "our derived veiling values are in good agreement with the estimate of @xcite for the k band and those of @xcite for @xmath159 m . however ,",
    "if the suggestion given above for the shape of the excess spectrum is correct , only a fraction of this excess emission arises from the accretion process and therefore our veiling estimates for the h , k and l bands are strict upper limits .",
    "although it is uncertain how much of the excess longwards of @xmath160 @xmath2 m is due to the effects of the lower gravity of tw hya relative to the comparison field m dwarf used for the subtraction , it is possible that this difference in gravity is responsible for nearly all of the observed excess in the h and k bands , and a significant fraction of the excess in the l band .",
    "the wavelength region around 1 @xmath2 m is ideal for spectral classification of cttss : ( 1 ) the excess emission arising from the accretion process , which is very strong in the uv and optical wavelengths , is relatively small ; ( 2 ) the emission from the accretion disk itself , which can dominate the spectrum at k band and longer wavelengths , is minimal ; ( 3 ) the effects of any extinction are mitigated substantially compared to the optical ; and ( 4 ) there are numerous strong photospheric absorption features present that can be used for classification .",
    "the last point is particularly important because , while the contributions from the accretion shock and circumstellar disk ( uv and ir excesses , respectively ) are at a relative minimum in the y and j bands , they are not necessarily negligible and evidence for significant j band veiling has been found in some sources @xcite .",
    "however , the ratio of absorption ews , as discussed in  3.1 , provides a veiling independent method of determining the spectral type of a source .",
    "although the relatively ` clean ' nature of this spectral region has been pointed out before @xcite and exploited to study the emission associated with the accretion process in cttss @xcite , this is the first time of which we are aware that the absorption features in this region have been used for spectral classification of a ctts .",
    "the absorption line ews we measure , in comparison with those derived from the irtf library spectra , provide strong evidence that the underlying star in tw hya has a spectral type of @xmath14 m2.5v .",
    "this result suggests that the values for the stellar mass and radius typically adopted in the literature ( @xmath161 k , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are incorrect , as they are based on an incorrect spectral type ( k7v ) .",
    "we suggest that the appropriate values for tw hya are @xmath164 k , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , based on an m2.5v spectral type , the temperature and mass calibrations given by @xcite and @xcite , and the estimated bolometric luminosity .    the spectral type we determine , and the stellar parameters we derive , are clearly inconsistent with those found by others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "examination of the spectra shown by @xcite indicates that the k7v spectral classification is appropriate , as tw hya clearly has an earlier type than those of the m stars shown . @xcite and @xcite fit atmosphere models to high resolution optical spectra and derived parameters again consistent with a k7v star . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass estimated for tw hya from the @xcite stellar parameters is far too large for even a k7v spectral type .",
    "furthermore , the moderate resolution optical spectrum presented by @xcite ( their figure 9 ) , with its strong rise in the continuum to the red and its sharp and prominent tio bandheads near 7100  , is more suggestive of an early m dwarf than a late k dwarf ( see below ) and does not seem to be completely consistent with the spectrum presented by @xcite .",
    "can these two discrepant spectral type classifications be reconciled ?",
    "the optical spectrum of tw hya suffers from considerable and variable veiling ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is possible that veiling has contributed to mis - classification , especially if the spectral comparison is restricted to very small wavelength regions lacking strong lines diagnostic of spectral type . to investigate this possibility , we selected an m2v star from the indo - us spectral library @xcite and added veiling in an attempt to reproduce a k7v star spectrum between 6400 and 7600    ( the spectral region displayed in fig .",
    "1b of @xcite ) .",
    "we found that it was not possible unless the veiling was substantially larger ( @xmath167 ) than that estimated by either @xcite or @xcite in this wavelength range .",
    "therefore , veiling can not be completely responsible for the classification differences .",
    "we also considered the possibility that tw hya is an unresolved binary .",
    "however , given the relative luminosities of k and m stars , it is not physically possible for a coeval k7v+m2.5v binary system to generate a spectrum in which the k7v component dominates the optical spectrum but is nearly invisible in the nir spectrum .",
    "because both the continuum and line emission are know to vary substantially in tw hya , it is tempting to consider the possibility that the spectrum ( and spectral type ) of the object varies as a function of both accretion rate and wavelength .",
    "a physically plausible explanation for this variation is that the spectrum of tw hya consists of two separate components , one due to the star ( m2.5v ) and one arising from an accretion hot spot , either on the surface of the star or located in the inner disk , or from the inner disk itself . in this scenario ,",
    "the hot spot or inner disk would have a temperature of @xmath168 k and would generate a spectrum similar to that of a k7v star .",
    "this component would also vary in strength with the accretion rate , dominating the ( optical ) spectrum and completely overwhelming the underlying m2.5v stellar spectrum when the accretion rate is high .",
    "support for this suggestion can be found by comparing the observed optical spectra with the reported h@xmath11 equivalent widths , a proxy for the accretion rate .",
    "the optical spectrum presented by @xcite is clearly that of a k7v star and yields an @xmath169  .",
    "similarly , the optical spectrum shown by @xcite is consistent with that of a k7v star and has @xmath170   ( c.  m.  johns - krull , private communication ) .",
    "the optical spectrum presented by @xcite , however , corresponds to spectral type intermediate between a k7v and an early m star , and has @xmath171 between @xmath172 and @xmath173  .",
    "in fact , when we attempted to reproduce the features seen in this spectrum we found that a combination of a k7v and an m2.5v , with roughly equal contributions at 0.8 @xmath2 m , provides a much better representation than any single k or early m spectrum alone . the shape and depth of the tio bands at 7100   and the simultaneous presence of these bands and a strong line at 7148",
    "   indicates that the observed spectrum is a composite of both a k7v and an early m type spectrum . in our nir spectrum of tw hya",
    ", the region shortward of 1@xmath2 m can also be well fit with an m2.5v spectrum and a small contribution from a k7v spectrum , comprising @xmath144% of the total flux at 0.8 @xmath2 m .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ m+k ] , where it can be seen that at wavelengths shorter than @xmath174 m we would expect that , during our observations of tw hya , the k7v spectrum contributed roughly half of the total flux , but comprised only a very small fraction of the flux longward of @xmath175 m .",
    "unfortunately a more satisfactory test of this suggestion can not be carried out with the spectra and accretion rates or ew values found in the literature .",
    "( surprisingly few optical and nir spectra of tw hya are actually shown in the voluminous literature on this object . )",
    "frequent simultaneous monitoring of tw hya in both the optical and nir wavelength regimes would be able to confirm or rule out our suggestion .",

    "large underestimates of both mass and age by the various models have been pointed out previously by @xcite . however , even accounting for an underestimate of the age by a factor perhaps as large as two @xcite would be insufficient to make the star 10 myr old .",
    "the models of @xcite provide a mass of @xmath179 , closest to our adopted value of @xmath178 .",
    "for these models , the age of tw hya estimated from the isochrones is @xmath3 myr .",
    "we note that the new location of tw hya on the h - r diagram actually brings this source into better agreement with other members of the twa , as can be seen from fig .  3 of @xcite , which indicates that , aside from twa 6 and twa 9 a and b , the locations of the members of the twa on the h - r diagram are consistent with an isochrone age for the association of @xmath180 myr .",
    "this age is also in reasonable agreement with the expansion age of the twa of @xmath181 myr derived by @xcite , and therefore alleviates to a considerable degree the previous discrepancy between the isochrone age of twa and dynamical age estimates .",
    "furthermore , compared to the usually adopted age of 10 myr , an age of 3 - 5 myr for tw hya is in much better agreement with estimates of the half life of accretion disks in low mass stellar systems of @xmath182 myr @xcite . by 10 myr",
    "the disks in such systems have usually transformed into debris disks with masses of @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the large mass of the disk in tw hya ( @xmath184 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore suggests an age of considerably less than 10 myr @xcite , in agreement with our much younger estimate .",
    "we also note that tw hya exhibits many of the same emission features , and has exactly the same li 6708  absorption ew , as the m2.5 star gn tau @xcite .",
    "the latter star is a low - mass t tauri star with an estimated age of @xmath3 myr , again providing support for our age estimate for tw hya .      the determination of an accurate spectral type permits the subtraction of the correct spectral template to reveal the emission from the accreting gas and the circumstellar disk .",
    "under the assumption that the h lines are optically thin and follow the case b predictions , our analysis of the h line flux ratios yields a temperature of @xmath185 k , a density of @xmath186 @xmath7 and a thickness of the emission column of @xmath187 km .",

    "the latter value is fairly close to our empirical results ( under the assumption that all of this material becomes fully ionized in the pre - shock region ) .",
    "the models also predict a temperature for this region of @xmath193 k , and thickness of the fully ionized zone of @xmath194 km , again in good agreement with our findings .",
    "recently @xcite has used interferometry to determine the stellocentric radii of the br @xmath13 emitting gas in t tauri and herbig ae / be stars .",

    "using our derived density and placing a limit on the optical depth of the pa @xmath12 line , we derive a lower limit to the fractional area covered by the accretion column of @xmath198 .",
    "our limit is well within the range of previous estimates of the covering fraction , for both tw hya itself as well as other cttss @xcite . although our limit is a factor of 7 larger than that estimated by @xcite , we also derive substantially larger ( factors of 4 - 5 ) values of the accretion luminosity and rate than these authors .",
    "( @xcite also derive a substantially larger value of the accretion energy flux @xmath188 than we do , largely because of this difference in the values of the covering fractions @xmath109 . )",

    "it is interesting to note that the values of the energy flux and covering fraction we derive for tw hya are very similar to those found by @xcite for cy tau , the star whose 1.083 @xmath2 m line profile resembles that in our spectrum of tw hya most closely .    despite the good agreement between our temperature and density estimates and the model predictions of @xcite , our values do not agree with those of @xcite for their sample of cttss , and our analysis rules out their values for tw hya with high confidence .",
    "@xcite do not present results for individual stars , so it is unclear how much variation they find from object to object .",

    "however , one would expect that higher mass loss rates would generate larger volume densities . at the moment",
    ", we have no satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "the high densities we derive provide a reasonable explanation for why other lines typical of ionized regions ( e.g. , forbidden lines of and ) are weak or absent in optical and nir spectra of tw hya obtained with narrow slits centered on the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since these ionization states are found primarily within the region where h is fully ionized and the density is well above the critical density for these transitions , the ground - state levels giving rise to these transitions are collisionally de - excited .",
    "spectra obtained with wide slits , encompassing lower density regions farther from the star , might be expected to reveal the usual forbidden lines ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is not immediately obvious , however , where the emission is generated .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the profile of the 0.8446 line correlates with that of pa 11 in a small sample of cttss , and therefore suggested that the lines were formed in a common region .",
    "furthermore , the lines in our spectrum of tw hya are unresolved at our resolution , which indicates that they are not arising from a region experiencing substantial infall or outflow , and therefore it is tempting to suggest that they are formed at the base of the accretion column , along with the h lines",
    ". however , production of the lines by ly @xmath12 fluorescence requires a high ly @xmath12 flux density in a region that contains neutral oxygen .",
    "the latter requirement is inconsistent with completely ionized h gas in the pre - shock region in the models of @xcite .",
    "a partially ionized region at the outer edge of the pre - shock region could be responsible for the emission .",
    "this region could also give rise to the [ ] 6300 , 6363 lines that are seen in the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , fluorescence also requires a large optical depth in the balmer transitions . using the equation given by @xcite for the escape probability of h@xmath11 , @xmath199 and that by @xcite for the optical depth @xmath200 in terms of @xmath199 , we derived a rough estimate of the h@xmath11 optical depth of @xmath201 .",
    "such a large optical depth in h@xmath11 seems incompatible with the finding that the observed h line strength ratios are well reproduced by the theoretical case b values ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "will be needed to resolve this puzzle .",
    "finally , our derived nir excess flux spectrum , usually interpreted as arising from the hot inner accretion disk , does not match that from any recent model of tw hya . while the h - band peak in our excess flux spectrum suggests a dust temperature of @xmath150k , which would be expected for dust in the inner disk , the sharp drops in flux at both shorter and longer wavelengths are not reproduced by current optically thin disk models .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , we suspect that most of this excess emission does not arise from the inner accretion disk , but is rather due to the lower h@xmath202 opacity in the star s atmosphere relative to that of an older , higher gravity field dwarf .",
    "therefore , during our observations , any nir emission from the hot inner accretion disk must have been very small , much smaller than either previous estimates or the predictions of current models .",
    "it is possible that previous values of the nir excess have been overestimated as a result of both the adoption of an incorrect spectral type for tw hya , as well as the spectral differences due to differences in the opacity , gravity , and age between tw hya and any comparison field dwarf .",
    "matching a library template with a spectral type earlier than m2v to the short wavelength end of the nir spectrum would yield substantially more excess emission at wavelengths @xmath203 @xmath2 m than we estimate .",
    "in addition , scaling earlier spectral type templates to match the observed tw hya flux levels between 0.95 and 1.34 @xmath2 m yields an excess spectrum for which synthetic photometry is in reasonable agreement with some of the models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , in these cases the resulting excess flux spectra appear to be unphysical ( because of negative values ) , and are certainly not the smooth blackbody functions characterized by a single dust temperature expected from the models or observed in other ctts sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we caution that any attempts to determine the nir excess emission arising from accretion disks around young stellar objects similar to tw hya must account for any possible differences in age and gravity between the target objects and the spectral templates .",
    "failure to do so could lead to spurious results .",
    "as we have shown here , the use of an old , higher gravity field dwarf as a spectral template can lead to an excess spectrum that primarily reflects differences in the h@xmath202 atmospheric opacity between the ctts and the template , not the emission from an accretion disk .",
    "we have presented new high signal - to - noise , moderate resolution nir spectra of tw hya obtained with spex at the irtf .",

    "the temperature and thickness values agree remarkably well with the predictions from the model of magnetospheric accretion developed by @xcite .",
    "we interpret the structure in the line profile as a reflection of the relative locations of the emitting regions : the narrow core arises from the base of the accretion shock column at the stellar photosphere , while the inverse p cygni absorption arises from the infall of gas in the accretion column and the extended wings arise from the outflow of material in a disk or coronal wind .",
    "analysis of the permitted lines indicates that they are generated by ly @xmath12 fluorescence .",
    "the location of the mostly neutral region generating the lines , however , is uncertain .",

    "<S> we present high signal - to - noise , moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath0 ) near - infrared ( @xmath1 @xmath2 m ) spectroscopy of the nearby t tauri star tw hya . by comparing the spectrum and the equivalent widths of several atomic and molecular features with those for stars in the irtf near - infrared library , we revise the spectral type to m2.5v , which is later than usually adopted ( k7v ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a substantially cooler stellar temperature than previously assumed . </S>",

    "<S> our derived physical parameter values agree with the predictions of the magnetospheric accretion scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the highest signal - to - noise h lines have profiles that indicate multiple emission components . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an excess spectrum ( above that of the m2.5v template ) that peaks in the h band . although our derived veiling values , @xmath10 , agree with previous estimates </S>",
    "<S> , the excess spectrum does not match that of current models in which this flux is generated by an inner optically thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the excess flux spectrum instead reflects the differences in atmospheric opacity , gravity , and age between tw hya and older , higher gravity field m2.5 dwarfs . </S>"
