    "the dynamics of the fluctuating magnetic field @xmath1 , is governed by the induction equation .",

    "( here @xmath4 , @xmath5 is some response time , and @xmath6 is the fluid density ) . assuming that the magnetic field is also gaussian random , subramanian ( 1997 , 1999 ; s99 ) derived closure equations for the longitudinal correlation function @xmath7 and the correlation function for magnetic helicity density , @xmath8 .",
    "the random @xmath2 has a longitudinal correlation function @xmath9 and a correlation function for the kinetic helicity density , @xmath10 .",
    "defining the operators @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , we then have , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the correlation function of the current helicity , @xmath15 is the effective induction . also @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions resembling the usual @xmath0-effect and the total magnetic diffusivity . here",
    "@xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 and @xmath20 the microscopic diffusion .",
    "note that at large scales @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0-effect suppression is similar to the @xmath0-suppression formula first found by pouquet et al .",
    "( 1976 ) ; @xmath24 is however enhanced by the growing field energy , as in ambipolar diffusion .      the ssd problem , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 has solutions with @xmath27 , and was first solved by kazantsev ( 1968 ) .",
    "a transformation of the form @xmath28 , maps the problem of getting @xmath29 modes , into a bound state problem in time - independent quantum mechanics ( qm ) . for turbulent motions on a scale @xmath30 , with a velocity @xmath31 ,",
    "bound states obtain provided the magnetic reynolds number ( mrn ) @xmath32 , and imply @xmath33 growing at rate @xmath34 .",
    "further , the bound - state eigen - function describes a field , which is strongly concentrated within the diffusive scale , @xmath35 , and curved on the scale @xmath30 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath20 is simply replaced by an effective , time dependent diffusion @xmath37 .",
    "so as the field ( and @xmath33 ) grows , the effective mrn @xmath38 is driven to the critical value @xmath39 .",
    "the final saturated state is obtained when @xmath40 .",
    "so at saturation , the average energy density @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a small fraction @xmath44 , of the equipartition value . if we intepret the saturated field configuration in terms of flux ropes with peak field @xmath45 , thickness @xmath46 , and curved on scale @xmath30 , @xmath47 . using @xmath48 , and @xmath42",
    ", we then have @xmath49 , where , remarkably , the @xmath50 dependence has disappeared .",
    "so the ssd could saturate with the small - scale field of equipartition strength , being concentrated into flux ropes of thickness @xmath51 , and curved on scale @xmath30 .      for helical turbulence with @xmath52 ,",
    "new generation terms arise at @xmath53 , due to the @xmath0- effect , in the form @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these lead to the growth of large - scale correlations on a scale @xmath56 , with a growth rate @xmath57 , as in the large - scale @xmath58- dynamo . a special wavenumber , @xmath59 , is also picked out for any quasi - stationary state . for such states , which obtain when one neglects slow resistive evolution ( see below ) , @xmath60 , implying @xmath61 . and",
    "if we define @xmath62 , the equation @xmath63 , can again be mapped to a qm potential problem , for the zero - energy eigen - state .",
    "however the modified potential now tends to a negative definite constant value of @xmath64 at large @xmath65 and so allows tunneling ( of the bound state ) ( see s99 ) .",
    "in fact for @xmath53 , one has an analytic solution @xmath66 , exactly as one would get if the large scale field , @xmath67 , was random and force - free with @xmath68 .",
    "the closure equations have also been solved numerically by brandenburg and subramanian ( 2000 ) ( bs2k ) , adopting forms for @xmath9 and @xmath10 to match closely with the direct simulation of brandenburg ( 2000 ) ( b2000 ) ( run 5 ) .",
    "one sees an initial exponential growth of the magnetic field , which terminates when its energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy .",
    "note that our closure equations satisfy the helicity constraint @xmath69 .",
    "the numerical solutions show that , after some time @xmath70 , the current helicity @xmath71 , is driven to a constant value which however is such that @xmath72 remains finite .",
    "a constant @xmath73 implies that the magnetic helicity @xmath74 grows linearly at a rate proportional to @xmath20 . during this phase",
    "the magnetic field correlations can extend to larger and larger scales .",
    "the corresponding magnetic energy spectra , @xmath75 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the resulting magnetic field is strongly helical ( cf .",
    "section 1.2 ) and the magnetic helicity spectra ( not shown ) satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "the development of a helicity wave travelling towards smaller and smaller @xmath77 , as seen in figure 1 , is in agreement with the closure model of pouquet et al .",
    "we have also checked that to a very good approximation the wavenumber of the peak is given by @xmath78 , as expected from section 1.2 , and it decreases with time because @xmath79 tends to a finite limit and @xmath80 increases .",
    "further , since the large scale field is helical , and since most of the magnetic energy is by now ( after @xmath81 ) in the large scales , the magnetic energy is proportional to @xmath82 , and can therefore only continue to grow at a resistively limited rate .",
    "these results are analogous to the full mhd case ( b2000 ) ; the helicity constraint is independent of the nature of the feedback ! in conclusion , our closure model with ambipolar diffusion type non - linearity provides a useful model , enabling progress to be made in understanding nonlinear dynamos .",
    "one now needs to think of ways , to relax the helicity constraint , ( cf .",
