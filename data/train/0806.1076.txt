    "secure authentication plays an important role in modern society , supporting various types of transactions .",
    "recently , there has been a surge in crimes involving skimming passwords in smart cards .",
    "in addition , computer viruses and criminals have led to authentication systems leaking customer passwords from certification agents which should be kept secret under normal circumstances .",
    "these issues expose the fragility of classical authentication methods .",
    "classical authentication is performed essentially by cross - checking classical secret information composed of alphanumeric characters and shared by two parties to identify each other .",
    "although improved methods have been developed which apply biometrics including fingerprints and iris codes , these can not stop skimming at a fundamental level .",
    "the root of the problem is that there exists no principle to prohibit the cloning of classical information .",
    "meanwhile , quantum authentication is a possible way to assure such safety by employing fundamental physics principles . under the no - cloning theorem wz of quantum information",
    ", there exists no physical process to perfectly copy quantum states non - orthogonal to each other .",
    "hence , by encoding secret information into non - orthogonal quantum states , it is possible to prevent perfect skimming .",
    "it is also known from the uncertainty principle @xcite that measurements for eavesdropping by an adversary can be detected by checking the change of quantum states .",
    "several quantum protocols for identification have been proposed .",
    "those methods can be classified into two basic classes of method . in the first method ,",
    "common secret keys are generated as classical information composed of alphanumeric characters @xcite-@xcite . in identification processes , shared classical information is converted into quantum information and sent from @xmath2 , who is a user , to @xmath3 , who is a certification agent . in the second method @xcite@xcite , secret keys are shared as quantum information from the start . for example , @xmath2 stores the information in a specific portable device , a quantum smart card , which is slotted into the quantum authentication machines of @xmath3 . though these quantum protocols have advantages over classical methods , several unsatisfactory aspects remain .",
    "for example , in the first method , clone leakage of classical secret keys from @xmath3 can not be prohibited in principle . for the second method",
    ", impersonation can not be prohibited when @xmath2 s quantum smart card is stolen .    in this paper , we propose a quantum protocol in which @xmath2 can require @xmath3 to identify herself under high security , overcoming the above disadvantages by using bell states and one - time - pad passwords together .",
    "@xmath2 s @xmath4qubits of shared bell pairs are stored in a quantum smart card . the password that @xmath2 determines",
    "is memorized only by @xmath2 and is not known by @xmath3 or others .",
    "the advantages of our protocol are the following .",
    "( i ) even if @xmath2 s quantum smart card is stolen by an adversary @xmath5 , @xmath5 can not impersonate @xmath2 without knowing her password .",
    "( ii ) no available information of the password is contained in the stolen card .",
    "( iii ) @xmath3 does not keep any information about @xmath6 s passwords , thereby avoiding the risk of clone - leakage from @xmath3 s storage by @xmath5 .",
    "( iv ) @xmath5 can not make perfect copies of the passwords by eavesdropping on quantum channels .",
    "moreover , by hiding quantum - mechanically encoded passwords behind many decoy qubits when sending to @xmath3 , a high rate of eavesdropping detection can be achieved .",
    "( v ) in identification tests of @xmath7by @xmath3 , entanglement between qubits of shared bell pairs and qubits of passwords is not generated .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 can use  @xmath2 s quantum - password qubits once and then throw them away .",
    "hence , @xmath3 must resend to @xmath2 only half of the qubits of the shared bell pairs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", typical protocols of quantum authentication proposed to date are briefly reviewed . in section 3",
    ", we propose a simplified protocol with quantum passwords by which we will explain the basic ideas of our full protocol . in section 4 , security analysis is given for the simplified protocol . in section 5 , an improved protocol with high security",
    "is proposed by extending the simplified protocol in section 3 .",
    "in this section , we characterize authentication by the following . ( a ) there exist two parties @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "( b ) the purpose of authentication is that @xmath3 identifies @xmath2 with high success probability .",
    "( c ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 have common secret keys that may be classical or quantum .",
    "( d ) authentication protocol are composed of the following phases .",
    "( d , i ) generation of secret keys .",
    "( d , ii ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 work upon those secret keys by local operations and individually store them .",
    "( d , iii ) in authentication , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are able to send their secret keys and other information using classical and quantum communication .",
    "( d , iv ) @xmath3 can check whether a user communicating with @xmath3 is a legitimate person , that is @xmath2 , using locally accessible information .",
    "if something is wrong with this check , the process stops .",

    "after that ,  the setup of ( d , ii ) is reproduced .",
    "if @xmath2 also wants to identify  @xmath3 , the above protocol applies with exchanged roles .",
    "the protocol is called quantum when it requires quantum information and quantum media . in the following , we briefly review some proposed protocols",
    ".    _ classical authentication _ : in ( c ) above , secret keys can be composed of bit numbers . in ( d , i ) ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 meet and share a sequence of numbers . in ( d , ii ) , they individually store the numbers without revealing them to any third party .",
    "for example , @xmath2 memorizes the secret key and @xmath3 stores the key in an electronic database . in ( d , iii ) ,",
    "@xmath2 encodes the memorized information by classical ciphers and sends it to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 decodes the information sent from @xmath2 . in ( d , iv )",
    ", @xmath3 compares the decoded result with her sequence of secret numbers .",
    "if the decoded information is consistent with the numbers , @xmath3 recognizes @xmath2 .",
    "if not , @xmath3 stops the process . in this protocol , there is no need for phase ( d , v ) because @xmath3 can discard the information sent from @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that this protocol can not eliminate the danger of undetected leakage by cloning the classical information .",
    "_ barnum 1 _ : barnum @xcite proposed two quantum protocols .",
    "the first method uses a sequence of qubit pairs in a fixed bell state as secret keys of phase ( c ) . in ( d , i ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 each share half of the bell pairs . in ( d , ii ) , @xmath2 stores her qubit pairs in a quantum smart card , while @xmath3 keeps hers in a quantum storage device . in ( d , iii )",
    ", @xmath2 sends the quantum states stored in the smart card to @xmath3 through a quantum channel . in ( d ,",
    "iv ) , @xmath3 performs a bell measurement of the qubits sent from @xmath2 and the qubits stored in @xmath3 s storage device . from the measurement results , @xmath3 verifies whether the two qubit states in the sequence are an original bell state .",
    "in general , entanglement states such as bell states exhibit purity properties only when all the entangled subsystems are gathered .",
    "a lack of some entangled subsystems leads to mixed states .",
    "if @xmath2 is a legitimate person , the two qubits measured by @xmath3 should be in a pure bell state to give an acceptable result . if an adversary @xmath5 attempts to impersonate @xmath2 ,  qubits sent from @xmath5 can not reproduce pure states with the qubits stored in @xmath3 s storage device .",
    "thus the bell measurement by @xmath3 detects inevitable errors for @xmath5 s qubits . in ( d , v ) , after @xmath3 recognizes @xmath2 correctly , @xmath3 resends half of the qubits of the bell pairs in the right state to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 then stores them again in her smart card . in this protocol",
    ", there is no danger of clone leakage of @xmath2 s secret information from @xmath3 , because @xmath3 s contracted quantum state of qubits is the maximal entropy state .",
    "this is a remarkable advantage over classical protocols .",
