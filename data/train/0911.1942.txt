    "the energy scale characteristic of the ew interactions , or the scale of electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , has not yet been experimentally explored in an extensive way , notwithstanding the results of lep and of the tevatron .",
    "its thorough exploration is the primary task of the lhc . in turn",
    "this suggests a cautious attitude in judging our level of understanding of the physics in the tev region and beyond it .",
    "broadly speaking , two alternative pictures can be thought of . in the first one ,",
    "the physics of ewsb is weakly coupled , a relatively light higgs boson exists ( as part of an extended system ) and , perhaps with the embedding of the standard model ( sm ) into a proper supersymmetric extension at the weak scale , the perturbative physics can be extrapolated to much higher energies without significant change . in the alternative case , the sm , with or without higgs boson(s )",
    ", can not be perturbatively extrapolated up to energies far above the fermi scale , because of new forces or new degrees of freedom or even new dimensions opening up nearby .",
    "these new phenomena are in a way or another responsible for ewsb .",
    "if it is allowed to characterize together all the different ideas belonging to the strong - coupling alternative , as opposed to the perturbative picture all the way up to the gut or the planck scale , it is clear that they suffer by a weaker calculative power .",
    "furthermore , explicit models are generally harder to accommodate with existing data , like the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) or the flavour tests .",
    "yet dismissing this broad alternative before seeing the lhc data would represent a severe unreasonable limitation .",
    "in fact we find it useful to take the following general attitude . rather than concentrating on any specific model of strong ewsb , it looks more useful to focus , whenever possible , on effective lagrangian descriptions of the new particles expected with the incorporation of the relevant symmetries , exact or approximate . among these particles",
    "there could be spin-0 , spin-1/2 or spin-1 states .",
    "the most obvious case is the one of a @xmath11-singlet scalar , i.e. a _ composite _ higgs boson @xcite .",
    "here we consider new spin-1 states .",
    "these states may be the lightest non standard particles and their discovery could provide the first clue of strong ewsb at the lhc .",
    "let us therefore make the assumption - pretty standard in this framework - that the new strong dynamics supposedly breaking the ew symmetry is by itself invariant under a global @xmath12 symmetry , spontaneously broken to the diagonal @xmath11 subgroup .",
    "we further assume that a vector state , @xmath13 , belonging to the adjoint representation of @xmath11 , exists as a physical degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath13 is sufficiently lighter than a cut - off scale @xmath14 tev , that its main properties can be caught by a suitable @xmath15 invariant lagrangian , also locally invariant under the sm gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "we shall ignore other spin-1 states that could occur below @xmath17 , although their incorporation would be straightforward and might be needed for a fully consistent picture .",
    "one or more vectors relatively light with respect to @xmath17 might be instrumental to keep the @xmath18 scattering amplitude from growing too much before @xmath17 @xciteand even , surprisingly enough and anyhow under suitable conditions , to provide consistency with the ewpt @xcite .",
    "if not too heavy , say below 1 tev , the single production , either by vector boson fusion ( vbf ) or by the drell  yan ( dy ) process , or its production in association with a standard gauge boson are very likely to be the first manifestations of @xmath13 at the lhc @xcite . to understand the underlying dynamics ,",
    "however , further measurements and observations will certainly be required .",
    "this motivates the study of the pair production of @xmath13 , which we are going to do in this work under the assumption that also this process at the lhc can be described by an appropriate effective lagrangian . from a phenomenological point of view , the pretty large number of different charge channels , from vbf or from dy , is of potential interest .",
    "we shall present the cross sections for @xmath13-pair production and the expected rates of multi - lepton events from the decay of such heavy vectors at the lhc , deferring to a further study a detailed investigation of the sm backgrounds , wherein acceptance cuts on final - state leptons and jets , as well as detector effects , are expected to play a role .",
    "we call these vectors _ composite _ since they should arise dynamically from the new strong interaction , which is left unspecified . as such ,",
    "the interactions of the composite vectors with the standard electroweak gauge bosons or among themselves are in general less constrained than if the new spin-1 states were the gauge vectors of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry .",
    "it is in fact interesting to study the constraints that would arise in this case , which we do by considering a gauge theory based on @xmath19 broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath20 by a generic non - linear @xmath3-model .",
    "this _ gauge _ model includes as special cases or approximates via deconstruction many of the models in the literature  csaki:2003dt , casalbuoni:1985kq , chivukula:2003kq , nomura:2003du , barbieri:2003pr , foadi:2003xa , georgi:2004iy . as foreseeable ,",
    "this proves useful in discussing the high energy behaviour of the production amplitudes of the spin-1 states . in turn",
    "this is important for a consistent description of a relatively light vector by an effective lagrangian approach , like the one attempted here .",
    "the starting point is the usual lowest order chiral lagrangian for the @xmath21 goldstone fields with the addition of the invariant kinetic terms for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bosons @xmath24 where @xmath25 the @xmath26 are the ordinary pauli matrices and @xmath27 denotes the trace over @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 gev . ] .",

    "the heavy spin-1 states are most often described by antisymmetric tensors @xcite . here",
    "we shall on the contrary make use of the more conventional lorentz vectors , belonging to the adjoint representation of @xmath11 , @xmath33    the @xmath34-invariant kinetic lagrangian for the heavy spin-1 fields is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath37\\,,\\qquad \\gamma_{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{2}\\big[u^{\\dag}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}-i{b}_{\\mu}\\right)u+u\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}-i{w}_{\\mu}\\right)u^{\\dag}\\big]\\,,\\qquad \\gamma_{\\mu}^{\\dag}=-\\gamma_{\\mu}\\ ] ] note that this covariant derivative transforms homogeneously as @xmath38 itself does .",
