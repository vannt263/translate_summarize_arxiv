    "optical interference is a very old technique which began with michelson s and young s experiments  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a beam of light is divided into two beams and , after traveling a distance long compared to the optical wavelength , these two beams are recombined at an observation point . if there is a small path difference between the beams , interference fringes",
    "are found at the observation point .",
    "the interference fringes are a manifestation of temporal coherence ( michelson interferometer ) or spatial coherence ( young interferometer ) between the two light beams .",
    "the interference experiments played a central role in early discussions of the dual nature of light , and the appearance of an interference pattern was recognized as a demonstration that light is a wave .",
    "the interpretation of the interference experiments changed with the birth of quantum mechanics , when corpuscular properties of light showed up in many experiments . according to the quantum mechanical interpretation , given by dirac  @xcite ,",
    "the interference pattern observed in the young s experiment results from a superposition of the probability amplitudes of a single photon to take either of two possible pathways .",
    "interference effects can be observed not only between two light beams but also between radiation fields emitted from a small number of atoms or even from a single multilevel atom  @xcite .",
    "the interest in quantum interference in atomic system stems from the early 1970s when agarwal  @xcite showed that the ordinary spontaneous decay of an excited degenerate @xmath0-type three - level atom can be modified due to interference between the two atomic transitions .",
    "the analysis of quantum interference has since been extended to multiatom systems and multi - level atoms .",
    "many interesting effects have been predicted and a very wide range of practical applications have been proposed .",
    "these are too numerous to detail here , but we may mention some of the ` traditional ' applications , such as control of optical properties of quantum systems , including high - contrast resonances  @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , lasing without inversion @xcite , amplification without population inversion   @xcite , enhancement of the index of refraction without absorption  @xcite , and ultra - slow velocities of light  @xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum interference has been recognized as the most significant mechanism for the modification and suppression of spontaneous emission .",
    "the control and suppression of spontaneous emission , which is a source of undesirable noise ( decoherence ) , is very significant in the context of quantum computation , teleportation , and quantum information processing .",
    "the effect of quantum interference on spontaneous emission in atomic and molecular systems is the generation of superposition states which can be manipulated by adjusting the polarizations of the transition dipole moments , or the amplitudes of the external driving fields .",
    "the spontaneous emission can also be controlled by manipulating the lasers phases @xcite . with a suitable choice of parameters",
    ", the superposition states can decay with controlled and significantly reduced rates .",
    "this modification can lead to subnatural linewidths in the fluorescence and absorption spectra  @xcite and population trapping  @xcite .",
    "although the trapping states have the common property that the population will stay in such a state for an extremely long time , they can however be implemented in different ways . in a multi - level system",
    "the population can be trapped in a linear superposition of the bare atomic states , or in a dressed state corresponding to an eigenstate of the atoms plus external fields , or in some cases , in one of the excited states of the system .",
    "in contrast to a simple theoretical picture of the effect of quantum interference on spontaneous emission in atomic systems , experimental work has proved to be extremely difficult , with only one experiment so far demonstrating the constructive and destructive interference effects in spontaneous emission  @xcite . in the experiment they used sodium dimers , which can be modeled as five - level molecular systems with a single ground level , two intermediate and two upper levels , driven by a two - photon process from the ground level to the upper doublet . by monitoring the fluorescence from the upper levels they observed that the total fluorescent intensity , as a function of two - photon detuning , is composed of two peaks on transitions with parallel and three peaks on transitions with antiparallel dipole moments .",
    "the observed variation of the number of peaks with the mutual polarization of the dipole moments gives compelling evidence for quantum interference in spontaneous emission .",
    "agarwal  @xcite has provided an intuitive picture for the observed spontaneous emission cancellation in terms of interference pathways involving a two - photon absorption process .",
    "berman  @xcite has shown that the experimentally observed cancellation of spontaneous emission involving a two - photon absorption process can be interpreted in terms of population trapping .",
    "although a cancellation of spontaneous emission is present with a two - photon excitation process , no variation of the number of peaks with the polarization of the dipole moments exist in the fluorescent intensity .",
    "recently , wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have presented a theoretical model of the observed fluorescence intensity which explains the variation of the number of the observed peaks with the mutual polarization of the molecular dipole moments .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the connection between quantum interference with optical beams and radiation fields emitted from atomic systems .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec2 ] by presenting basic concepts and definitions of the first- and second - order correlation functions , which are frequently used in the analysis of the interference phenomena .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] describes the master equation approach to quantum interference effects in atomic and molecular systems . in sections  [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss different methods to implement two transitions with non - orthogonal dipole moments . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    ", we derive general conditions for quantum interference in a two - atom system and discuss the role of the interatomic interactions .",
    "next , in section  [ sec6 ] , we discuss general conditions for a control of spontaneous emission from two coupled systems and explain the relation between population trapping and dark states . in section  [ sec7 ] , we present quantum dressed - atom models of cancellation of spontaneous emission , amplification on dark transitions , fluorescence quenching , and coherent population trapping .",
    "the phenomenon of optical interference is usually described in completely classical terms , in which optical fields are represented by classical plane waves .",
    "the classical theory readily explains the presence of an interference pattern in the first - order optical coherence . however , there are higher - order interference effects that distinguish the quantum nature of light from the wave nature .",
    "the simplest example for a demonstration of the first - order optical interference is the young s double slit experiment in which two light beams of amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , produced at two slits located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , incident on the screen at a point @xmath5 , whose position vector is * r*. the resulting average intensity of the two fields detected at the point @xmath5 can be written as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the first order correlation function ( coherence ) between the field at @xmath8 and the complex - conjugate field at @xmath9 , at times @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 is a constant which depends on the geometry and the size of the @xmath13th slit . here",
    "@xmath14 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the normalized first - order correlation function as @xmath15 satisfying the condition @xmath16 .",
    "the normalized correlation function  ( [ 3 ] ) is often called the degree of coherence and @xmath17 for two independent fields , whereas @xmath18 for perfectly correlated fields .",
    "the intermediate values of @xmath19 @xmath20 characterize a partial coherence between the fields .",
    "the average intensity @xmath21 depends on @xmath19 and in the case of identical slits @xmath22 and perfectly correlated fields @xmath23 , the intensity can vary from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , giving the so - called interference pattern .",
    "when @xmath26 , the total average intensity varies from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , giving maximal interference . for two independent fields , @xmath29 , and",
    "then the resulting intensity is just the sum of the intensities of the two fields , that does not vary with the position of  @xmath30 .",
    "the usual measure of the depth of modulation ( sharpness ) of interference fringes is the visibility in an interference pattern defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the intensity maxima and minima at the point @xmath30 .    since @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "we obtain @xmath36 thus , @xmath37 determines the visibility of the interference fringes . in the special case of equal intensities of the two fields @xmath38 ,",
    "the visibility simplifies to @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath37 is then equal to the visibility .",
    "for perfectly correlated fields @xmath40 , while @xmath41 for uncorrelated fields .",
    "when @xmath42 , the visibility is always smaller than one , even for perfectly correlated fields .",
    "this fact is related to the problem of extracting which way information has been transferred through the slits into the point @xmath30 ( _ welcher weg _ or_which - way _ information ) .",
    "the observation of an interference pattern and the acquisition of which - way information are mutually exclusive : a which - way measurement necessarily destroys the interference fringes .",
    "we can introduce an inequality according to which the fringe visibility @xmath43 displayed at the point  @xmath30 and an absolute upper bound on the amount of which - way information @xmath44 that can be detected at the point @xmath45 defined as the difference in the probabilities for taking either of the two paths , are related by  @xcite @xmath46 hence , the extreme situations characterized by perfect fringe visibility @xmath47 or full knowledge of which - way information has been transmitted @xmath48 are mutually exclusive . in order to distinguish",
    "which - way information has been transmitted , one can locate an intensity detector at the point @xmath30 and adjust it to measure a field of a particular intensity @xmath49 .",
    "when the fields coming from the slits have the same intensities , the detector can not distinguish which - way the fields came to the point @xmath30 , so there is no which - way information available @xmath50 resulting in perfect fringe visibility @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    ", when the intensities of the fields are different @xmath51 , the detector adjusted to measure a particular intensity can distinguish which way the field came to the point @xmath30 resulting in the disappearance of the interference fringes .",
    "this is clearly seen from eq .",

    "the same arguments apply to the frequencies and phases of the detected fields .",
    "information about the frequencies and phases of the detected fields is provided by the argument and phase of @xmath56 . moreover",
    ", the phase of @xmath56 determines the positions of the fringes in the interference pattern .",
    "if the observation point @xmath30 lies in the far field zone of the radiation emitted by the slits , the fields at the observation point can be approximated by plane waves which may be written as @xmath57 = { \\bf e}\\left ( { \\bf r}_{i},t\\right ) \\exp \\left [ -i\\left ( \\omega _ { i}r_{i}/c+\\phi _ { i}\\right ) \\right ] , \\quad i=1,2 ,   \\label{9}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the angular frequency of the @xmath13th field and @xmath59 is its initial phase .",
    "we can measure the frequencies from the average frequency of the two fields as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average frequency , and @xmath62 .",
    "since the observation point lies in the far field zone of the radiation emitted by the slits , i.e. the separation between the slits is very small compared to the distance to the point @xmath30 , we can write approximately @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the unit vector in the direction @xmath65 . hence , substituting eq .

    "let us analyze the physical meaning of the exponents appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the first exponent depends on the separation between the slits and the position  @xmath65 of the point  @xmath30 . for small separations",
    "the exponent changes slowly with the position  @xmath65 and leads to minima and maxima in the interference pattern .",
    "the minima appear whenever @xmath72 the second exponent , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , depends on the sum of the position of the slits , the ratio @xmath73 and the difference @xmath74 between the initial phases of the fields .",
    "this term introduces limits on the visibility of the interference pattern and can affect the pattern only if the frequencies and the initial phases of the fields are different . even for equal and well stabilized phases , but significantly different frequencies of the fields such that @xmath75 , the exponent oscillates rapidly with @xmath65 leading to the disappearance of the interference pattern .",
    "thus , in order to observe an interference pattern it is important to have two fields of well stabilized phases and equal or nearly equal frequencies .",
    "otherwise , no interference pattern can be observed even if the fields are perfectly correlated .",
    "the dependence of the interference pattern on the frequencies and phases of the fields is related to the problem of extracting which - way information .",
    "consider the case where the two fields have mean intensities : @xmath76 for perfectly correlated fields with equal frequencies @xmath77 and equal initial phases @xmath78 , the total intensity at the point  @xmath30 is @xmath79 giving an interference pattern with the maximum visibility of 100% .",
    "there are no features of the two beams which can be used to distinguish between them . for general frequencies and phases , the total intensity at the point @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath80 .",

    "of which - way information , a detector adjusted to measure a particular frequency or phase could distinguish between the two fields .",
    "clearly , one could tell which way the detected field came to the point @xmath30 .    thus , whether which - way information is available or not depends on the frequencies and phases as well as the intensities of the interfering fields .",
    "maximum possible which - way information results in destruction of the interference pattern , and vice versa , a complete lack of which - way information results in maximum visibility of the interference pattern .      the analysis of the interference phenomenon can be extended into higher - order correlation functions . the first experimental demonstration that such correlations exist in optical fields",
    "was given by hanbury - brown and twiss  @xcite , who measured the second - order correlation function of a thermal field .",

    "the second - order correlation function has completely different coherence properties than the first - order correlation function .",
    "an interference pattern can be observed in the second - order correlation function , but in contrast to the first - order correlation function , the interference appears between two points located at @xmath87 and @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , an interference pattern can be observed even if the fields are produced by two independent sources for which the phase difference @xmath91 is completely random  @xcite . in this case",

    "the coherence properties are discussed in terms of the negative and positive frequency parts @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the total field operator @xmath103 @xcite .    in the quantum description of the field ,",

    "<S> we discuss the connection between quantum interference effects in optical beams and radiation fields emitted from atomic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this connection by a study of the first- and second - order correlation functions of optical fields and atomic dipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the role of correlations between the emitting systems and present examples of practical methods to implement two systems with non - orthogonal dipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive general conditions for quantum interference in a two - atom system and for a control of spontaneous emission . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between population trapping and dark states is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we present quantum dressed - atom models of cancellation of spontaneous emission , amplification on dark transitions , fluorescence quenching and coherent population trapping . </S>"
