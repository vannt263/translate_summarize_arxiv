    "globular clusters ( gcs ) come in different colors , which are low - resolution diagnostics of the rich collection of astrophysical parameters that characterize their constituent stellar populations .",
    "it is well established that there are blue and red populations of gcs in every massive galaxy @xcite , which correspond to metal - poor and metal - rich stellar populations @xcite , and that their proportion depends on the environment , in particular , the mass of the host galaxy @xcite and the galactocentric distance @xcite .",
    "in general , the gc system color distribution of a more massive galaxy will be broader and its mean shifted to redder colors than in a less massive one .",
    "this trend is often interpreted as a radial metallicity gradient .",

    "such analyses were based on a single photometric color of rich gc systems @xcite .  those studies that used color - color planes as diagnostic tools were hampered by relatively small gc sample sizes to be able to assess any environmental dependence @xcite .    in this letter , we present a detailed color - color plane analysis of the gc photometric properties in the pilot region of the _ next generation virgo cluster survey _",

    "this sample contains objects with sextractor magnitude errors smaller than 0.06 mag in each band , typical magnitudes around 21 in @xmath5 , and typical masses of about @xmath8 .",
    "paper i provides limits on systematic photometric errors ( of order 2 - 3% in most bands , 5% in @xmath9 ) , and notes these would lead to global shifts in color - color diagrams . here , we apply the offsets @xmath10 mag and @xmath11 mag recommended in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 10 @xcite , that were discussed but not applied in paper i.  the gc sample was selected in a  modified @xmath12 diagram \" , that combines @xmath13 and @xmath14 color information with a compactness index measured on the ngvs @xmath5-band images ( i.e.  structural information of the sources ) .",
    "this ensures a very robust separation between gcs , stars and galaxies , in contrast to any separation one would obtain from optical colors alone .",

    "sub - sample * c * includes all the gcs located even further out from m87 , with the exception of those located around other relatively large galaxies , which are grouped in subset * d*.    we begin to analyze the optical @xmath24 color - color distributions of these four subsets in figure  [ 3ccd ] , and observe that they differ both in mean color and shape .  to guide the eye , and to recall the typical degeneracy between age and metallicity in the predicted colors of single stellar populations ( ssp ) ,",
    "we superimpose a set of models from @xcite with ages @xmath25gyr and metallicities @xmath26 .",
    "while this degeneracy is strong in all model sets with given abundance ratios , we caution that the actual loci and shapes of synthetic distributions remain strongly model - dependent , as illustrated extensively in paper i.    samples * a * , * b * and * c * demonstrate that the @xmath27 color - color distribution changes significantly with distance to the center of m87 .",
    "this is highlighted in the density plots of the bottom row of figure [ 3ccd ] : for the peak of the distribution ( usually referred to as the blue peak ) we report color differences of @xmath28 mag and @xmath29 mag between subsets * c * and * a*.  unlike sample * a * , samples * b * and * c * exhibit a shallower color - color relation and are increasingly offset towards bluer average colors .",
    "this evolution is consistent with * b * containing a composite of * a * and * c * gcs .",
    "we note that the color - color relation of the mw gcs ( black diamonds ) best matches subset * c*.    to characterize the influence of the environment , we have computed the maximum - likelihood linear relation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each gc sample . these fitted lines mainly help emphasizing the overall trend of the color - color distribution .",
    "sub - samples * d * and * a * share similarly steep slopes , whereas the computed mw gc color - color slope is shallowest but similar to that of virgo sample * c*.  however , we caution that the mw gc sample contains only 11 data points .  despite this limitation",
    "it can be stated that the gcs located nearest to m87 host stellar populations with significantly different properties than those in set * c * or in the mw sample .",
    "differences between gc color distributions have been discussed mainly in terms of metallicity distributions in the past .",
    "our results indicate that extra parameters are required .",
    "considering metallicity together with age remains insufficient , because of the strong degeneracy between age and metallicity predicted by old ssp models in the relevant color - color planes .",
    "at least a third parameter is necessary .",
    "we present in figure  [ 3ccde ] three additional color - color diagrams ( @xmath32 , @xmath12 , and @xmath33 along with the @xmath24 plane from figure  [ 3ccd ] ) comparing ngvs gcs ( colored dots ) with the mw gcs ( black diamonds ) .  the locus of m87 gcs ( subset * a * ) is impressively tight , although the dispersion around this locus is slightly larger than what is expected from random photometric errors . in general ,",
    "the color distributions of m87 and mw gcs are strikingly different , in particular in the @xmath32 and @xmath24 planes .",
    "the m87 clusters have redder @xmath34 and @xmath35 colors than mw clusters .",
    "moreover , the slopes of the trends differ for the two samples .    in the top right panel of figure  [ 3ccde ] , vectors show the shifts in the @xmath24 plane resulting from : the average extinction vector ; the change of the index of a power - law imf from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( the vector depends on age and metallicity , hence the ellipse ) ; an age difference of 10 gyr at @xmath38 , and the same at @xmath39 .",
    "none of these changes induces a variation that would reasonably explain the observations ( see section  [ discussion ] ) .    using the mw clusters in the @xmath32 diagram to guide the eye",
    ", we find that the virgo sample contains a subset of some 30 red gcs whose colors align with those of the mw gcs , rather than with those of m87 .",
    "we select the most obvious of these in the @xmath32 panel of figure  [ 3ccde ] ( inside the blue polygon ) and display them as blue dots in the other panels , referring to these as subset * e*.  it is worth noting that these particular clusters , like any other cluster with colors similar to those of mw gcs , would have been easily mistaken for stars on the basis of optical colors alone ( grey dots in figure  [ 3ccde ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12 diagram , however , clearly separates them from stars , as do their slightly extended radial profiles , which are akin to typical gcs , but about @xmath40 narrower than the ones expected for ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) at the virgo distance .",
    "moreover , four of the subset * e * objects are spectroscopically confirmed as gcs , whereas no data is available for the other 22 candidates .",
    "the subset * e * gcs are uniformly spread over the ngvs pilot field , with some of them clustered around m86 and ngc4438 ( figure [ radeca1 ] ) .  we do not observe any overdensity around m87 , which strongly suggests that they were formed in an environment other than the m87 host halo .  in a recent study , @xcite estimated that a significant fraction of the gcs in the virgo core may be inherited from infalling galaxies , that were themselves fully or partly shredded by tidal forces .",
    "it is thus plausible that the gcs identified here are born in an environment less dense than the virgo core .",
    "our data for virgo and mw gcs suggests that the dependence of gc color distributions on environment is more complex than previously thought .",
    "in particular , their discussion can not be restricted to the existence or absence of a bimodal metallicity distribution .",
    "gcs in different environments may have color - color distributions that differ in slope in addition to being offset from each other .",
    "this result puts the definition of the usual blue and red sub - populations in question , and calls for a larger variety of gc formation scenarios .    before examining physical parameters that may play a role in this complexity , we examine and eliminate potential observational biases .",
    "_ photometry _ : systematic errors in the photometry would not explain differences in the shapes of the distributions , nor would they produce differences between the subsets we have defined within the ngvs sample .  a size - color relation is known among gcs in various galaxies based on hubble space telescope data ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with blue clusters typically being @xmath41 larger than red ones .",
    "if the aperture corrections applied to ngvs clusters left size - dependent effects in the colors , we would expect those to be strongest at the blue end of the distribution , while we observe the largest internal deviations at the red end .",
    "there is also a known size - luminosity relation for bright gcs in massive galaxies @xcite and we might expect the color - color relations to deviate between bright and faint gcs .",
    "no such trend was found in our data either .",
    "finally , we have checked that the trends we describe within ngvs are not residual effects of seeing differences between the individual fields of view combined to cover the virgo core region .",
    "_ dust extinction _ : as the virgo core region is located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath42 ) , the extinction corrections are small @xcite :  @xmath43 mag and @xmath44 mag across the field .",
    "a change of the extinction law or a rescaling of the extinction vector would shift the color distributions without much changing their shape .",
    "we have found no spatial correlation between color - based subsets of clusters and the extinction map of @xcite .    _ size effects in the mw gcs _ : the observation areas of the mw gcs are restricted to @xmath19 around their respective centers .",
    "efficient mass segregation could have raised the relative number of massive stars around the center , compared to the cluster as a whole .  a changed proportion of a certain type of stars ( e.g. main sequence , blue straggler or red giant branch ) may cause a non - negligible color variation .",
    "we tested this by adding stellar spectra of relevant types to the x - shooter spectra of the clusters .",
    "the direction found for these variations is always roughly parallel to the mw sequence in the @xmath24 plane and , therefore , can not explain the difference with the gc locus around m87 .",
    "having found no observational bias to explain the observed color distributions , we consider physical causes . as age and metallicity",
    "are highly degenerate in the @xmath24 diagram , we consider parameters other than these two .    _ gc mass _ : mw gcs are typically about @xmath45 less massive than those in the virgo sample . if gc mass was driving the color differences in the @xmath24 diagram , the virgo clusters in subset * e * would be expected to have systematically lower masses than the other virgo gcs in our dataset .",
    "we have estimated virgo gc masses using ssp model inversion using predictions of 7 recent models ( powalka et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ ) .  the mean estimated masses of each of our virgo subsets are yet similar ( @xmath46 for * a * , * d * and for the clusters isolated as subset * e * in @xmath24 and @xmath47 for * b * and * c * ) .",
    "in addition , we show in figure  [ fig5 ] two extreme 10%-iles of the virgo gcs mass distribution , with masses @xmath48 ( q10 , similar to the mw gcs ) and @xmath49 ( q90 ) .  although there is a lack of low - mass virgo gcs at red colors - band fluxes of such low - mass , metal - rich gcs , which do not pass our photometric quality selection criteria .",
    "] ,  we find no significant correlation between gc mass ( or luminosity ) and the association with one or the other color - color sequence .",
    "this implies that the gc colors are mainly influenced by the global environment , rather than by the local environment set by the gc mass .",
    "however , a complete low - mass gc sample would be necessary to perfectly clinch this point .",
    "@xmath30 versus @xmath31 color - color diagram for three gc samples selected by their masses which provides evidence that mass is not the driving factor in the difference between virgo gcs in subset * e * or elsewhere . ]    _ initial mass function ( imf ) _ : models constructed with a range of extreme imfs produce a marginal modification ( see figure  [ 3ccde ] ) , dwarfed by the age and/or metallicity variations expected for the gc samples @xcite",
    ".    _ chemical variance _ : at this stage of the analysis , we attribute much of the dependence between the gc color - color locus and environment to abundance variations .  in massive mw clusters , detailed studies have shown that stars with a large range of chemical abundances may coexist , even when heavy - element stellar abundances are homogeneous ( see e.g.  the recent review of @xcite ) .",
    "several previous studies have also hinted at abundance variations in m87 gcs @xcite .",
    "abundance ratios influence the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , which strongly influences the relation between optical and near - infrared colors @xcite .  however , the tight locus of our virgo gc sample in the @xmath12 diagram is incompatible with wild variations of the hb morphology between clusters ( unless some other parameters conspire to counteract the effect of the hb variations ) .",
    "a similar argument also tends to exclude largely varying proportions of blue stragglers .    to explain our observations , a spectral effect localized in the range of the @xmath50 bands would be more suitable .",
    "molecular bands that depend on the surface abundances of cno - cycle elements , may produce such an effect .",
    "unfortunately , very few ssp models allow for cno abundance variations , mostly because stellar spectral libraries are incomplete .",
    "the computations recently started by @xcite are , as yet , sampled too sparsely ( e.g in metallicity and gravity for n - enhanced models ) to conclude whether or not cno abundances produce the required changes in color .  models that consistently vary light element abundances both in the stellar evolution tracks ( hb morphology ) and in the stellar spectra ( molecular bands ) are lacking .  finally , varying [ @xmath51/fe ] ratios might also play a role , for instance via molecular bands and the near - infrared caii triplet .",
    "self - enrichment via core collapse supernovae is very limited in mw clusters @xcite , but the story may be different at the masses of the virgo gcs studied here , as suspected in several studies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "we have briefly assessed this point using ssp model predictions from pegase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modified by mp , al , and p. prugniel ) with two stellar libraries at [ @xmath51/fe ]  @xmath52 and 0.4dex .",
    "the increase of [ @xmath51/fe ] produces a shift in the model predictions qualitatively from the mw towards the m87 gc sequence , but the amplitude of this shift is @xmath53 smaller than the observed offset .",
    "other studies such as @xcite found similar color offset amplitudes .",
    "in this letter , we conduct a comparison of the optical color - color properties of gc samples from different environments .  we find that previous descriptions of the effects of environment on gc color - distributions are insufficient to capture the actual diversity seen in color - color planes : the samples studied exhibit separate color - color relations unexplained by the commonly accepted age and metallicity variations .    with the environmental subdivision in the ngvs pilot field , we observe that the virgo subset * a * ( i.e.  gcs within 20kpc of m87 ) exhibit a steeper color - color relation than the mw and the virgo * c * sample ( i.e.  gcs located far from massive virgo galaxies ) .",
    "we note that a reduced subset of the ngvs gcs shares a color trend with the mw gcs .",
    "the spatial distribution of this subset lends credence to differences related to the environment .  however , a spectroscopic confirmation of a larger sample would be strongly desirable to support the identification of this subpopulation .",
    "we also confirm a relation between the mean gc color and the galactocentric distance to m87 .",
    "we find a shift towards redder average colors with decreasing galactocentric radius , @xmath54 times larger in @xmath31 than in @xmath30 , although they share similar dynamic color ranges ( i.e.  @xmath55 ) .      a possible explanation for the measured color - environment correlations might be the imprint of global elemental abundance variations in the stellar atmospheres of gc stars .",
    "the lack of correlation with gc luminosity and mass of the variance in the color - color relations implies that such changes might not be due to the local gc environment , but should have their cause in the global host galaxy environment .    to conclude , we believe that the complex relation between environment and chemical enrichment of gc populations could be a major constraint on galaxy formation models in the future decades .",
    "this result could modify our current vision of the formation and assembly of gc systems , mainly by considering gcs conjointly with their host galaxy .",
    "a more precise and quantitative assessment will be needed in the future to deepen our understanding of these observations .",

    "<S> our results demonstrate that stellar population diagnostics derived from model predictions which are calibrated on one particular sample of gcs may not be appropriate for all extragalactic gcs .  </S>",
    "<S> these results advocate a more complex model of the assembly history of gc systems in massive galaxies that goes beyond the simple bimodality found in previous decades . </S>"
