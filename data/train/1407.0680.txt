    "we have shown , that contrary to previous assumptions , a possible substantial increase in the localization length of two interacting particles in a random potential sets in at unexpectedly weak disorder values .",
    "this is due to a gradual restoring of momentum conservation in single particle eigenstates in the limit of vanishing disorder .",
    "that in turn enforces a highly inhomogeneous resonance network of matrix elements .",
    "the scaling of the overlap integrals along the resonant network is much weaker than predicted in previous papers because phase correlations and relative position shifts of eigenstates have to be taken into account .",
    "resonant links between fock states follow the resonance network .",
    "the connectivity in fock space grows substantially with weak disorder , indicating the possibility of the emergence of a new localization ength scale for two interacting particles .",
    "because this potential regime is setting in at anomalously weak disorder strength , previous numerical scaling tests are not conclusive ( too strong disorder ) .",
    "but even more , with current computers and exact diagonalization methods it is highly nontrivial to enter the desired potential scaling regime which starts at @xmath57 and should extend at least down to @xmath109 to estimate exponents .",
    "therefore we are in need of new computational methods .",
    "we also conjecture that a breaking of particle - hole symmetry by adding next - to - nearest neighbour hoppings will lead to a further supression of the delocalization trend by interactions .",

    "<S> we study the interaction - induced connectivity in the fock space of two particles in a disordered one - dimensional potential . </S>",
    "<S> recent computational studies showed that the largest localization length @xmath0 of two interacting particles in a weakly random tight binding chain is increasing unexpectedly slow relative to the single particle localization length @xmath1 , questioning previous scaling estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we show this to be a consequence of the approximate restoring of momentum conservation of weakly localized single particle eigenstates , and disorder - induced phase shifts for partially overlapping states . </S>",
    "<S> the leading resonant links appear among states which share the same energy and momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we substantiate our analytical approach by computational studies for up to @xmath2 . a potential nontrivial scaling regime sets in for @xmath3 , way beyond all previous numerical attacks .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction. _ the interplay between anderson localization @xcite and many body interactions @xcite has been for decades in the research focus of condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical results are not rigorous , and rely on physical intuition , independent computational studies , and of course experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the case of few interacting particles seems to be an exception , as computational approaches are expected to easily do the job here . for two interacting particles ( tip ) in a one - dimensional chain with weak diagonal disorder a number of studies over the past twenty years produced interesting yet contradicting predictions on the scaling of the largest two - particle localization length @xmath4 with the single particle localization length @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these range from @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite to @xmath7 @xcite , thus from the existence of a second length scale ( @xmath8 ) to the nonexistence of such a scale ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent computational studies of the tip eigenstates @xcite show that down to the weakest disorder values accessed by numerical diagonalizations @xcite , the largest tip localization length is @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the above scaling predictions are not supported by published numerical results . in another recent study , a surprising tip wavepacket subdiffusion on length scales </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 has been found for @xmath1 as large as @xmath11 @xcite , further fueling the request to understand the tip dynamics at weak disorder .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address the intrinsic reasons for the listed discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the single particle eigenstates ( spe ) and compute overlap integrals and connectivities in the fock space of two particle eigenstates ( tpe ) at zero interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show , that contrary to previous assumptions , the overlap integrals show a highly inhomogeneous distribution at weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> spe gradually restore standing wave phase relations that occur in the tight - binding model without disorder , @xmath12 @xcite leading to approximate momentum conservation selection rules in the overlap integrals . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> strongly connected tpe have to satisfy approximate energy conservation . </S>",
    "<S> large connectivities set in at previously unexpected low values of disorder - because of the combined action of momentum restoring and relative spatial shifts of the spe on the phase relations between interacting tpe . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the rigorous diagonalization of tip in the regime of strong connectivity is a matter of future computations , as present cpus are hardly capable of doing the job .    _ </S>",
    "<S> model. _ we consider the hubbard hamiltonian with disorder @xmath13,\\,\\ , \\\\ { \\cal \\hat h}_{int } = \\sum\\limits_l\\left [ \\frac{u}{2}\\hat a_{l}^+\\hat a_l^+\\hat a_{l}\\hat a_l\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and two indistinguishable bosons . </S>",
    "<S> note that the results are not changing when considering two distinguishable particles , e.g. two fermions with opposite spins .         </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ eq_hamilt ] ) consists of non - interacting and interacting parts , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are standard boson creation and annihilation operators on a lattice site @xmath18 and @xmath19 measures the interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> the random uncorrelated on - site energies @xmath20 are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath22 denoting the disorder strength .    _ </S>",
    "<S> one particle. _ in this case the interaction term does not contribute . using the basis @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites ) , the spe @xmath26 are defined through the localized eigenvectors @xmath27 @xcite of the eigenvalue problem @xmath28 the eigenvalues @xmath29 fill a band with a width @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the most extended spe correspond to the band center @xmath31 with localization length @xmath32 in the limit of weak disorder @xmath33 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average volume @xmath34 which an spe occupies is estimated to be about @xmath35 for weak disorder @xcite .    _ two particles. _ for @xmath36 we construct a complete basis of orthonormalized two - particle eigenstates which span a fock space as product states of spe @xmath37 tip eigenstates @xmath38 of the interacting particle problem @xmath39 can be represented in fock space as @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath41 satisfy the eigenvalue problem @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the overlap integrals . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 and therefore the noninteracting case @xmath36 yields an eigenenergy band with width @xmath45 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows straight from eq.([eq1511 ] ) that two fock states are strongly ( nonperturbatively ) coupled if @xmath46 where the energy mismatch is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 the interaction separates two particle bound states with double occupancy per site off a continuum of states with one particle per site @xcite . in that case , the bound states localize in space even stronger than the single particle states due to the energy separation cost to move one particle . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining states form a hilbert space of two noninteracting spinless fermions and yield no increase in the localization length as well ( as compared to the single particle case ) . therefore , the strongest effect the interaction can have on increasing the localization length is for @xmath49 which we will assume from here on .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from ( [ r_def ] ) that a strong link is realized when the energy mismatch @xmath50 is small ( ideally zero ) and the overlap integral @xmath51 is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of possible strong ( resonant ) links from a given reference fock state @xmath52 is finite . </S>",
    "<S> overlap integrals are exponentially small unless all four single particle states which define one integral @xmath51 are sufficiently close to each other in real space . </S>",
    "<S> thus a given reference fock state has at most approximately @xmath53 other basis states which form an interaction network , from which a resonant subset can be chosen .    _ overlap integrals and energy mismatch. _ we first numerically diagonalize the single particle problem ( [ aa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a single particle reference state with energy close to zero , and determine the subset of all neigbouring spe in the same localization volume @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we order them with increasing energy corresponding to increasing indices @xmath54 . the corresponding momentum can be well approximated as @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained two - dimensional momentum space is used to construct interacting fock states . </S>",
    "<S> next we choose a reference fock state with @xmath56 for @xmath57 and perform a disorder averaging of the overlap integrals @xmath51 with fock states with some given @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for the reference state being at the center , the diagonal , and the antidiagonal of the two - dimensional momentum space .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the overlap integrals are predominantly nonzero along certain straight lines . </S>",
    "<S> these lines follow simple momentum conservation rules for two interacting particles in a box of size @xmath34 @xcite , underpinning therefore that @xmath58 is a momentum index for weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the reasons why previous attempts to estimate averages of overlap integrals over the whole momentum space were not useful @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us minimize the energy mismatch ( [ dl_def ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle energy can be estimated as @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the energy mismatch is exactly zeroed if the condition @xmath60 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> it defines some curved line in @xmath61 space . </S>",
    "<S> the notable exception is the antidiagonal straight line in fig.[fig1 ] ( left and right plots ) which does conserve both the energy and the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> note that this coincidence of momentum and energy conservation for pairs of two particle fock states along the antidiagonal is the result of the restoring of a particle hole symmetry of the considered model in the limit of vanishing disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the tight binding model is a member of a family of models with hopping over odd distances in real space only , which allows the introduction of ab sublattices , and results ( for @xmath12 ) in the eigenvector property @xmath62 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the subset of fock states along the antidiagonal only with @xmath63 ( center ) and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> it is this tiny subset which is capable to set up the strongest resonant network and substantially delocalize two interacting particles , as compared to one . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the variation of the overlap integrals along the antidiagonal for @xmath65 and @xmath57 in fig.[fig2 ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( upper curve ) and @xmath57 ( lower curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reference fock state is at the center @xmath63 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we observe a peak at the center which corresponds to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> its value can be estimated using normalization properties of spe as @xmath67 . for @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> this yelds 0.013 and for @xmath57 respectively 0.0008 , which are reasonably close to the numerical data 0.03 and 0.002 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> their ratio is 16 from the estimate and 15 from numerics , showing that we correctly determine the scaling . off the peak we find a plateau at </S>",
    "<S> significantly reduced values @xmath68 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is due to relative shifts of spe in real space . for weak disorder , </S>",
    "<S> assume that each spe is given by @xmath70 for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 encodes the spatial position of the spe . </S>",
    "<S> the average of the overlap integral along the antidiagonal is equivalent to averaging @xmath73 over @xmath58 and over all possible values of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical prefactor @xmath76 originates from the relative shift of flat and constant distributions along the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling @xmath77 however is due to the phase mismatch of spe shifted relatively to each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling is much weaker than the @xmath78 law predicted in @xcite because the standing wave phase correlations were neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of the energy mismatch @xmath50 along the antidiagonal follow approximately a normal distribution with the characteristic energy scale @xmath79 @xcite , due to the central limit theorem already at work . </S>",
    "<S> a quick estimate of the probability of resonance ( [ r_def ] ) yields a number independent of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore fluctuations of the overlap integral values , and their correlations to the energy mismatch might be of decisive importance .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn to numerical data . in fig.[fig3 </S>",
    "<S> ] we show the observed locations of all resonant partner fock states ( @xmath80 ) for different reference fock states . </S>",
    "<S> for a reference state @xmath63 we nicely observe the grouping of all network partners along the antidiagonal ( fig.[fig3 ] left plot ) . for another reference state @xmath81 on the antidiagional </S>",
    "<S> the network partners still belong to the antidiagonal neighborhood , simply their number decreases ( fig.[fig3 ] right plot ) . for reference states off the antidiagonal ( fig.[fig3 ] right plot ) the network partners are located close to curved lines which are a manifestation of the single particle dispersion ( energy conservation , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mismatch ] ) ) , with even smaller partner numbers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we confirm that resonances are defined by momentum and energy conservation .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 which satisfy the resonance condition @xmath82 with the reference modes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 , @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are performed for @xmath57 and different pairs of @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( shown by filled circles ) located at the centre ( left panel ) and at antidiagonal , diagonal and arbitrary location of @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( right panel ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ connectivity. _ a central property of any network is the connectivity @xmath85 - the number of links from a given reference state to other partners . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath86 do not lead to any substantial increase of the localization length , as there is a high probability to terminate the path after one or two connections . for a given pair @xmath83 and @xmath84 the connectivity @xmath85 to all pairs of modes @xmath87 and @xmath58 residing the same localization volume , is defined as the number of connections for which @xmath88 fulfills the condition ( [ r_def ] ) ( if any ) . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluated its average @xmath89 for @xmath63 : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the potentially interesting regime of sufficiently large connectivity is accessed only for @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> all previous diagonalization studies were exploring @xmath95 . despite the fact that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the numerically accessed parameter interval turns out to be irrelevant for the study of a possible dramatic increase in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the above discussed smallness in the overlap integrals which originates from the relative shifts of spe with standing wave phase relations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the connectivity increase for @xmath94 happens also for other choices of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance for @xmath99 , @xmath100 we find @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> still it is much weaker than the numbers obtained for the antidiagonal , as shown in fig.[fig4](a , b ) . in fig.[fig4](c ) we show the distribution of @xmath85 for @xmath102 and two reference fock states - for the center and the diagonal in fig.[fig1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> larger values of @xmath89 do not necessarily lead to an enhancement of the localization length , since there can be closed loops in the resonant network in fock space , whose length simply increases . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of loops is enforcing a certain degree of correlations between the resonant links . </S>",
    "<S> assume the opposite - i.e. that the actual values of @xmath80 which define a set of links from a given reference state to other fock states , are not correlated . </S>",
    "<S> then , the connectivity @xmath85 must be binomially distributed because @xmath85 would be nothing more than a number of successful events @xmath103 in a sequence of @xmath104 independent yes / no experiments , each of which yields success with probability @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus one expects @xmath106 note , that the average coordination number @xmath89 for the binomial distribution is related to @xmath105 as @xmath107 . on the other hand , we know @xmath89 from the numerical simulations and therefore can easily calculate the success probability @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we test this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> results of the comparison of the numerically obtained @xmath108 and corresponding binomial distributions are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a strong deviation of numerical pdfs from the binomial distributions , concluding that resonances are not completely independent events . </S>",
    "<S> this might be a hint that resonant loops in fock space are formed , which could act against delocalization . </S>"
