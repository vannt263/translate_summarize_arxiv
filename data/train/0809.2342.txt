    "percolation  @xcite clusters are random fractals . due to their randomness , it is natural to characterize their properties , such as geometrical and transport properties , by means of probability distribution functions .",
    "the perhaps most basic of these distribution functions is the the percolation correlation function @xmath0 which measures the pair connection probability , i.e. , the probability that two sites located at space coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 are connected . for many applications , it is useful to consider percolation models that allow for additional processes to unfold on the clusters .",
    "the most prominent model of this kind is the random resistor network ( rrn ) where occupied bonds are viewed as resistors so that the clusters can transport electric currents .",
    "one of the typical questions that are addressed when studying the rrn is that of the total resistance @xmath3 between 2 leads located at points @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ on the same cluster_. because the underlying cluster is random , the @xmath3 is a random number governed by a distribution function , @xmath4 .",
    "experimentally , this distribution might be determined as follows : measure the resistance between all pairs of sites with separation @xmath5 using an ohmmeter . discard all measurements yielding an infinite value as these measurements probe sites belonging to different clusters .",
    "prepare a histogram that collects the measured finite values .",
    "then , @xmath6 corresponds to the number of points in the histogram between @xmath7 and @xmath8 divided by the number of measurements with finite outcome .",
    "a similar experiment has been performed , e.g. , some 20 years ago by rammal , lemieux and tremblay  @xcite .",
    "other interesting measurable quantities that are intimately related to the transport properties of percolation clusters include the masses ( the number of bonds ) of various fractal substructures of the clusters .",
    "the most prominent substructures of a cluster are perhaps the backbone ( the set of bonds that carry current ) , the red bonds ( the bonds that are singly connected and hence carry the full current ) as well as the shortest , the longest and the average self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on the cluster .",
    "their masses are random numbers , and the corresponding distribution functions can be measured in much the same way as described above for the total resistance .    in this paper , we study the distribution functions of the pair connection probability , the total resistance and the masses of fractal substructures by using renormalized field theory .",
    "our work is based on the harris - lubensky ( hl ) model  @xcite for the rrn and its nonlinear generalization by harris  @xcite . in this generalized model ,",
    "the bonds are assumed to have a nonlinear current - voltage characteristic of the type @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the main benefit of this generalization is that it allows to map out the aforementioned fractal substructures by taking the appropriate limits with respect to @xmath10 : the limit @xmath11 leads to the backbone , whereas @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 lead to the red bonds , the shortest and the longest self - avoiding path , respectively .",
    "of course , one retrieves the linear rrn for @xmath15 . via these limits , the distribution functions of the total resistance and the fractal masses are all related to one single distribution function , namely that of the total nonlinear resistance .",
    "regarding the average saw , the story is somewhat more complex . obviously , the length of the average saw lies between the lengths of the shortest and the longest saw . in a certain sense ,",
    "the average saw is concealed somewhere in the discontinuity at @xmath16 , and it not clear how to extract its length by taking a limit of the nonlinear rrn .",
    "recently  @xcite , we proposed a method to calculate the scaling form of this length via using our real - world interpretation of the feynman diagrams of the rrn , which we will explain below . in this paper , we use this method ( which is intimately related to a correct interpretation of the meir - harris model  @xcite ) to determine the distribution of this length .    in their seminal paper  @xcite",
    ", hl studied among many other interesting things the asymptotic form at criticality of the distribution @xmath17 of the linear total resistance for large @xmath7 .",
    "their calculation is based on the assumption that the _ unconditional _ probability @xmath18 for measuring @xmath7 , which differs from @xmath17 in that infinite resistances are not discarded , becomes independent of @xmath1 for large @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption is problematic , however , because large @xmath7 corresponds due to scaling to short distances , and in critical phenomena , short distances generically lead to extra singularities which has qualitative consequences  @xcite .",
    "our careful analysis , based on the so - called short - distance expansion as a field - theoretic tool , reveals that this assumption breaks down beyond mean - field theory , and hence the long - standing result by hl turns out being incorrect for dimensions @xmath19 .    before moving into the depths of field theory",
    ", we would like to summarize for the convenience of the reader the resulting picture of the various distribution functions .",
