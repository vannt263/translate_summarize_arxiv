    "michaelis - menten ( mm ) kinetics , that characterizes enzymatic reactions @xcite , is a well known example in biomathematics @xcite of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) characterized by two definitely different time scales .",
    "in fact , usually the complex reaches a _ quasi - steady - state _ of equilibrium with the substrate at the very beginning , whereas the generally experimentally observed part of the reaction happens on a time scale that can be as larger as several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the standard quasi - steady - state approximation ( sqssa ) @xcite , in which the independent variables are chosen to be the substrate and the complex , with the time derivative of the complex taken to be zero , is the routinely considered starting point for investigating the system s dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , different starting points are considered in the literature .",
    "actually , from the theoretical point of view @xcite , mm kinetics is an example of boundary layer problem .",
    "therefore , in the standard methods the solutions are approximated by the perturbation expansion ( pe ) , in an appropriate parameter @xmath1 , of both the inner and the outer components of the two chosen independent variables , _",
    "i.e. _ , of the solutions of systems of two odes with regular and singular perturbations , respectively , with the further imposition of the appropriate matching conditions ( mcs ) , at each order in @xmath1 . within this framework , both the sqssa and the _ total _ quasi - steady - state approximation ( tqssa )",
    "@xcite represent the 0th order terms of the outer solutions .",
    "noticeably , the pe beyond the tqssa , in which the independent variables are chosen to be the total substrate ( _ i.e. _ , the sum of the substrate and of the complex ) and the complex , has the advantage that the value of the expansion parameter is lower than 1 ( indeed , one has @xmath2 in this case ) , for whatever kinetic constants and for whatever initial condition values ( icvs ) @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in testing the correctness , in the case of mm kinetics , of the renormalization group approach to singularly perturbed differential equations ( spderg ) proposed by chen , goldenfeld and oono in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus on the simpler case of the pe beyond the sqssa , by moreover making the usual choice for the expansion parameter ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the initial enzyme concentration and @xmath5 the initial substrate one ) @xcite . it can be shown that in this case the approximated solution in the substrate / complex phase space converges rapidly to the exact one , for reasonably small @xmath1 values @xcite , and it was indeed proved that this pe ( for @xmath6 ) converges uniformly for all times @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problem is not obvious to be solved , because both of the practical difficulty in explicitly finding the outer components , and of the peculiarity in the mcs to be imposed , whose number of terms increases with the considered order in the expansion @xcite .",
    "these difficulties are shared by the other standard pe methods for mm kinetics considered in the literature , such as in particular the one beyond the tqssa @xcite .",
    "even more because of these difficulties , after recalling the sqssa and the main known results of the pe beyond it , we apply to mm kinetics the spderg alternative approach proposed in @xcite , that is based on the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "noticeably , a preliminary attempt to apply this approach in the present case , in the even more demanding case of the tqssa framework , has been presented in @xcite , but we follow here the different way of directly renormalizing the bare icvs ( for the sake of precision , the one of the substrate ) .    in fact , though this approach appears more generally applicable , it was in particular already shown successful for obtaining the leading terms of the uniform approximations ( uas ) of the corresponding pe in other cases of dynamics characterized by the presence of a boundary layer @xcite . from the point of view of the present application , in which we calculate in detail the solutions up to 2nd order , we anticipate that the work could appear quite technical and cumbersome , nevertheless the calculations do not imply particular difficulties . on the other hand",
    ", this application to the demanding situation of mm kinetics , within the sqssa framework , appears to allow to better understand both the working principles and the advantages / limits of the approach in similar cases , besides highlighting the analogies and the differences with the standard pe .",
    "indeed , the study appears to make possible to get some insights on the working principles of the pe itself , too .",
    "moreover , we obtain a more detailed knowledge of mm dynamics within the sqssa framework , even only from the point of view of the 2nd order contributions to the inner solutions , that are presented here for the first time to our knowledge . from this last perspective , it is to be noticed that the calculation of the 2nd order inner contribution is not merely a technical exercise , but is fundamental for an in - depth understanding of the spderg scheme in the present case , as we will show in the paper .",
    "the paper substantially consists of a first more introductive part , and of a second part in which we present and discuss our results . in detail ,",
    "in the first part , we recall : in section [ review1 ] , the basis of mm kinetics and the sqssa , by moreover introducing the particular values of the kinetic constants and the two icv sets that we consider ; in section [ review2 ] , the results of the standard pe beyond the sqssa , up to the known 1st order ; in section [ alter ] , the basis of the alternative spderg approach proposed in @xcite , with attention to the case of boundary layer problems . in the second part , we present and discuss : in section [ rdi ] , the derivation of the 1st order spderg uas ; in section [ rdii ] , the calculation of the 2nd order contributions to the spderg uas ; in section [ rdiiref ] , the refined 2nd order spderg uas that can be proposed ; in section [ rdcomp ] , the comparison between the different best uas that we considered .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] , we present our conclusions . the paper is moreover completed by three appendices : in appendix a and in appendix b we report the 1st order inner solution for the complex , and the 2nd order ones both for the substrate and the complex for partially general icvs , respectively ; in appendix c we verify that the ode obtained at the 2nd order from the study of the substrate is indeed the same ode that one finds from the study of the complex .",
    "the sqssa represents a milestone in the mathematical modelling of enzymatic reactions @xcite .",
    "here we just remind that the original paper by michaelis and menten dates back to more than one century ago @xcite , that the idea was already present in the previous paper by henry @xcite , and that the approach was further developed in particular by briggs and haldane @xcite .",
    "schematically @xcite , one is modelling the reaction between the enzyme @xmath8 , the substrate @xmath9 , the complex @xmath10 , and the product @xmath11 : @xmath12 that is reversible in the first part and irreversible in the second one , with associated kinetic constants @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "when introducing the concentrations @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , by using the mass action law , we arrive to describe the process by means of a system of four 1st order odes .",
    "then , within the standard framework @xcite , we start by using the conservation law @xmath20 , that implies that the enzyme concentration @xmath16 does only depend on the complex one @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the product concentration @xmath19 can be obtained from the complex concentration @xmath18 by integrating ( equivalently , one can use the other conservation law , @xmath21 ) .",
    "finally , we assume that the concentrations of the complex and of the product are zero at the beginning for simplicity ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence , we end up with the well known system of two 1st order odes that are to be obeyed by the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( with icvs @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 \\left [ c(t ) - \\frac{\\textstyle e_0 s(t ) } { \\textstyle s(t)+k_d } \\right   ] \\\\",
    "\\dot{c}(t)&=&-k_1[s(t)+k_m ] \\left [ c(t ) - \\frac{\\textstyle e_0 s(t ) } { \\textstyle s(t)+k_m }   \\right ] , \\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{mmineq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot means the time derivative . here",
    "@xmath26 is the so - called dissociation constant , whereas @xmath27 is the parameter that is generally known as michaelis constant .",
    "it can be further noticed that @xmath28 is the usual van slyke - cullen constant @xcite .",
    "though the original kinetic constants , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the key physical parameters for the studied system , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 turn out to be the experimentally measurable ones , usually in particular on the basis of the sqssa .    for the sake of clarity , a set of values for the kinetic constants can be chosen to be @xcite : @xmath32 as we will discuss in detail in the following , this choice already corresponds to a demanding case for applying the sqssa , thus it is appropriate for the present analysis . in particular , these kinetic constants give @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we will moreover consider two sets of icvs : @xmath36 where we are taking different values of the initial enzyme concentration @xmath4 , with @xmath37 , by labelling @xmath38 and @xmath39 the two corresponding sets .",
    "we plot in [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ mmineq ] ) , obtained by numerically integrating the system , for these two sets of values , respectively .",
    "the logarithmic scale in the figures enhances the typical presence of two definitely different time scales , with the concentration of the complex @xmath18 that evolves very rapidly at the beginning whereas it turns out to be in a _ quasi - steady - state _ or _ pseudo quasi - equilibrium _ in the second part , of definitely longer duration .",
    "indeed , the presence of a _ plateau _ , in which the complex is really roughly constant , is well more evident in case @xmath38 , and we will show in the following that this choice of the icvs corresponds to a situation in which the sqssa is expected to work better",
    ".    in fact , in the sqssa one looks at the second part , by directly taking @xmath40 in eqs .",
    "( [ mmineq ] ) ( which is obviously quite a coarse approximation , though it does not mean that the complex is assumed to be constant , but only that it depends algebraically on the substrate ) . therefore , the approximation is the more correct the more the time scale corresponding to the rapid transient phase for the complex , @xmath41 , is small with respect to the time scale @xmath42 , that rules the slow decay of the substrate .",
    "though one can argue about more refined time scale evaluations @xcite , the most intuitive choice in order to roughly get the @xmath41 order of magnitude corresponds to assume a constant substrate concentration in the first part , _",
    "i.e. _ , a complex concentration that approximatively approaches exponentially its _ plateau _ value at the beginning @xcite , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , that takes the same values @xmath45 in our case , for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 icv sets respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "when instead assuming @xmath40 in the second part , one finds @xcite @xmath46 , that approximatively describes the exponential decay to zero of the substrate in the end . correspondingly , the substrate decay time is @xmath47 , that takes instead the two different values @xmath48 and @xmath49 in our case .",
    "hence , the substrate decay time is well larger for the @xmath38 set of icvs than for the @xmath39 one .",
    "let us now look more in detail at the behaviours displayed by the present numerical solutions of the original problem ( [ mmineq ] ) when plotted in logarithmic scale .",
    "in fact , in the case of the substrate , one observes , both in [ fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ] and in [ fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ] , the presence of three inflection points . indeed , this feature appears to depend on the present choices of the kinetic constants and of the icvs .",
    "we checked in particular the case @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 with the @xmath38 set of icvs and the present case with a definitely smaller value of @xmath53 , and we found a ( not shown ) simpler behaviour , with only one inflection point in the curve for the substrate .",
    "it is therefore even more interesting that , as can be seen from [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] , though the used approximations for evaluating the time scales can look questionable , in logarithmic scale the obtained estimation of @xmath42 captures quite accurately the last ( _ i.e. _ , the third ) inflection point in the curve for the substrate , that therefore appears to be interpretable as the substrate decay time . on the other hand ,",
    "the obtained estimation for @xmath41 captures quite accurately the first inflection point in the curve for the complex , that therefore appears interpretable as the complex saturation time .",
    "in fact , the position of the third inflection point in the curve of the substrate roughly coincides with the one of the second inflection point in the curve for the complex .",
    "correspondingly , both of the inflection points in the curve for the complex are captured by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ( this is more evident in the case of the @xmath38 set of icv ) .",
    "moreover , the complex saturation time @xmath41 turns out to be quite near to the first inflection point in the curve for the substrate .    from this point of view , we notice that , in the previously recalled simpler considered cases , in which the ( not shown ) curves for the substrates display single inflection points in logarithmic scale , their positions are more accurately captured by the corresponding substrate decay times @xmath42 , and both @xmath41 and @xmath42 more accurately capture the positions of the two inflection points in the complex curves .    with the aim of deepening the analysis , we are led to the problem of adimensionalising the system in eqs .",
    "( [ mmineq ] ) .",
    "this involves the choice of the @xmath1 variable as the one giving the sqssa condition @xmath40 for @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , this @xmath1 variable is clearly also the candidate for pes that make possible to go beyond the sqssa .    at this point",
    ", we remind that there are different approaches , in which for instance one chooses a different expansion parameter @xmath1 @xcite , or different independent variables at the beginning , such as in the already recalled tqssa @xcite , that turns out to make possible to describe a larger range of experimental situations and that could be therefore particularly useful in many cases .    in the present work , in order to test the spderg approach to mm kinetics , we focus on the sqssa . in detail , within the two known possible adimensionalization schemes and the two corresponding different choices of the @xmath1 variable @xcite in this case , we study the one that is more largely considered in the literature @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 .    in detail",
    ", one introduces the adimensional variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and one scales the time of a factor @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the substrate concentration is made adimensional by taking @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , in the presently considered scheme , the complex concentration is made adimensional by taking @xmath61 ( which is a possible correct choice since , thanks to the first of the recalled conservation laws , @xmath62 ) .",
    "correspondingly , one obtains the ( singular with respect to @xmath1 ) system of odes : @xmath63 \\left [ \\tilde{c}^{out}(t ) -   \\frac{\\textstyle   \\tilde{s}^{out}(t ) } { \\textstyle \\tilde{s}^{out}(t)+m } \\right   ] \\\\",

    ", we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the two sets of icvs ( [ initialvalues ] ) yield two different values for @xmath57 and for the expansion parameter @xmath1 : @xmath66 thus , though the basic condition @xmath6 is verified in both of the cases , we are in the situation @xmath67 , that is expected to be the most appropriate for highlighting differences in the considered approximations .",
    "the sqssa corresponds clearly to take @xmath54 .",
    "in fact @xcite , it can be rigorously interpreted as the 0th order term of an asymptotic expansion in @xmath1 of this example of singular perturbation , in which the original system is reduced to one ode and one algebraic relation .",
    "for @xmath54 , one has : @xmath68 it is to be noted that , in the numerator of the ode to be obeyed by @xmath69 , the quantity @xmath70 is just the adimensionalized van slyke - cullen constant @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "we show in [ fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] our results for the two considered sets of icvs , in comparison with the numerical solution of the original problem ( [ mmineq ] ) ( the same curves as in [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] ) .",
    "we note qualitatively that the failure of the approximation is well more evident for the @xmath39 set of icvs ( [ fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ] and [ fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ] ) , as it could be expected , since @xmath67 . in both cases , in these figures the logarithmic scale highlights that the complex very short time behaviour is not captured at all , a well known failure of the sqssa ( that is shared by the tqssa , too ) . from this point of view , it is to be stressed that , as we already pointed out , whereas one can solve eqs .",
    "( [ qssa ] ) by choosing @xmath77 , the original icv for the complex concentration can not _ a priori _ be satisfied within the present context . therefore , the approximation is unable to predict the initial increase from zero of this quantity .",
    "noticeably , moreover , with the chosen kinetic constants and icvs , the presence of more than one inflection point in logarithmic scale in the curve for the substrate ( hence the short time qualitative behaviour of this quantity ) is not reproduced at all .",
    "in fact , also the maximum reached by the complex during its evolution is lower than the icv within the sqssa in both of the considered cases . in particular , this last qualitative feature of a complex maximum lower than the sqssa icv is not at all observed in the previously recalled simpler considered cases , in which the ( not shown ) curves for the substrates display a single inflection point in logarithmic scale , supporting the hypothesis that the various effects are related .",
    "reasonably , it is for this reason that , in case @xmath39 , it is naked - eye evident that the sqssa fails in reproducing the long time behaviour , too ( see [ fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ] and [ fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ] ) . indeed",
    ", this case is even more demanding because of the quite large @xmath82 . in detail",
    ", one observes here sqssa long time behaviours that tend to zero definitely more quickly than the numerical solutions of the original problem .",
    "thus , as anticipated , this is a particularly demanding situation for correctly approximating mm dynamics and studying the standard pe that goes beyond the sqssa .",
    "the standard pe method , also in the case of mm kinetics @xcite , is based on mathematical results for systems of odes with both singular and regular perturbations . precisely within this framework , system ( [ outer ] ) is a well known example of singular perturbation , that is to be obeyed by the outer solutions of the original system . in the same framework ,",
    "system ( [ outer ] ) needs to be considered together with the system that one obtains by taking @xmath83 , _",

    "one then imposes the appropriate mcs and takes , as uas to the correct solutions at a given order in @xmath1 , the sum of the inner and of the outer solutions at that order minus the common terms @xcite .",
    "the whole procedure appears therefore quite a standard pe method . for the sake of consistency",

    "moreover , a recent review of the general method , in a context that is instead different from the boundary layer one , is presented in @xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to recall in some detail the original discussion in @xcite , where the approach was generally proposed for multiple - scale problems , in the case of the boundary layer ones .",
    "indeed , in those works , the method was already shown successful in some of these last cases .",
    "as mm kinetics @xcite , these problems @xcite are generally characterized by a boundary layer of a given small thickness ( that is here @xmath125 , but that could also be , for instance , @xmath126 ) , in which the solution is rapidly varying .",
    "correspondingly , in order to predict the system s dynamics , one needs to solve singularly perturbed odes and one usually resorts to a standard pe method .    to start to sketch the general spderg procedure in these cases , one starts from the singular 2nd order ode for @xmath127 and makes the transformation @xmath83 , thereby studying the ode to be obeyed by the inner solution @xmath128 .",
    "the approach basically consists in focusing on the large @xmath90 behaviour of this solution , by outlining the secular terms , with the aim of proposing first of all the correct renormalization of the integration constants , that allows to eliminate them .    at this point",
    ", we anticipate that in the end one usually gets @xcite a physically meaningful solution , that also contains the leading terms of the outer expansion , and that is therefore to be interpreted as the ua within this approach , to be compared with the one of the standard pe methods .",
    "as we are going to verify in detail in the present application , this approximation is expected @xcite to work even better than the corresponding ua solution of the pe at the previous order in the matching region . moreover , as we are going to discuss , it appears possible to make an analogy between the basic mechanism of the spderg approach to boundary layer problems and the one that allows to impose the correct mcs in the standard methods .",
    "more precisely @xcite , one studies the solution @xmath128 with given boundary conditions at a given time @xmath129 and _ renormalizes _ the @xmath130 part of this solutions that contains the cauchy data , the other leading order terms and the terms that do not tend to zero or to a constant value at large times .",
    "this is obtained by renormalizing the corresponding _ bare _ integration constants ( _ i.e. _ , the cauchy data of the problem , though these integration constants can also more generally _ contain _ them in some given form ) , let us say @xmath131 and @xmath132 , as @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , the renormalization constants @xmath135 and @xmath136 depend both on @xmath129 and @xmath137 , their basic role being to change , in the part to be renormalized of the function , the initial dependence of the cauchy data on @xmath129 in a dependence on the arbitrary time @xmath137 .    in detail , they are assumed to have the expansion ( with @xmath138 ) : @xmath139 since one can always take @xmath140 , the secular terms in @xmath141 are correspondingly absorbable in appropriate redefinitions of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , that have to be made by correctly choosing the coefficients @xmath144 .",
    "as it will become clear in the application that we are going to present , one can usually safely expect to be able to absorb in the coefficients of the renormalization constants also other possible secular terms , for instance those corresponding to higher powers of @xmath145 .",
    "in particular , we will see in the present 2nd order calculations that , when writing @xmath146 , only the second term is to be absorbed , whereas the last one is cancelled by the previously chosen 1st order renormalization coefficients , in the same way as in a case that is considered in @xcite ( see section b in that work ) .    summarizing @xcite , the basic hypothesis , that is analogous to the scaling one in the renormalization group theory , is that the bare quantities need to be renormalized in such a way that the solution turns out to be independent of the arbitrary time @xmath137 , as it has reasonably to be .",
    "hence , @xmath137 plays a key role in the whole approach .",
    "intuitively , one can therefore think to @xmath137 as the equivalent of the _ unknown time _ at which the matching needs to be obeyed , and from this point of view there is an analogy with the imposition of the mcs in the standard pe methods .",
    "nevertheless , though this analogy can be useful , as we will show , it is not to be taken too rigorously , particularly in the present peculiar case in which the 1st order matching requires two term conditions , and one expects that the correct matching could require even more terms at higher orders @xcite .",
    "going back to the recalling of the main details of the approach in the case of boundary layer problems @xcite , the appropriate choice of the coefficients of the renormalization constants , and the appropriate redefinitions of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , turns out in the replacement of these bare quantities with @xmath147 and @xmath148 , and in the corresponding change of variable @xmath149 in @xmath130 .",
    "then , on this @xmath137-depending @xmath150 , one imposes the _ scaling _ condition @xmath151 , that allows to obtain the 1st order odes to be obeyed by @xmath147 and @xmath148 . finally , the change of variable @xmath152 in the renormalized @xmath150 , in which the integration constants are replaced by the solutions of these equations , and the imposition of the original boundary conditions of the problem , allow to get the physically meaningful result .",
    "here we use , for the first time to our knowledge , the spderg approach to study mm kinetics beyond the sqssa , whose known pe uas we already recalled in sections [ review1 ] and [ review2 ] . in order to make the presentation as clear as possible",
    ", we stress from the beginning that we introduce a procedure that is slightly different from the one considered in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we make explicit the dependence from the icvs in the solutions , thus outlining that , though in principle one can renormalize even general integration constants that contain them , the bare quantities that are basically to be renormalized are just the icvs of the problem .",
    "we notice first of all that one can rewrite the system ( [ inner ] ) for the inner solutions in the form of a 2nd order ode ( see in particular @xcite for the first study of mm kinetics in terms of a 2nd order ode ) to be obeyed by the adimensional substrate concentration : @xmath153 ^ 2 } { \\textstyle { \\tilde{s}}^{in}(\\tau)+m}+   \\left [ \\tilde{s}^{in}(\\tau)+m \\right ]",

    "correspondingly , the usual asymptotically vanishing solution behaviour that one finds when applying the recalled pe method to mm kinetics ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath225 ) , is not verified here ( one has @xmath226 ) .",
    "we will better discuss this failure of the present application of the spderg approach in the following , by proposing a way to bypass it , too .",
    "let us now study the complex .",
    "first of all , despite of the presence of a large number of terms in ( [ solcrg1 ] ) ( the formula given in appendix a ) , that describes the behaviour of the 1st order inner adimensional complex concentration within the spderg approach , @xmath188 , the part of the function to be renormalized up to the 1st order in @xmath1 is as manageable as in the case of the substrate .    in detail , we write the same kind of expression as in ( [ srgin1 ] ) : @xmath227 by collecting in @xmath228 all the sub - leading terms that tend to zero or to a constant value in the large time limit .",
    "correspondingly , we find : @xmath229    in fact , here we considered explicitly the terms that give the original icv , ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath230 ) .",
    "nevertheless , both the 0th order contribution and the 1st order one to it are exponentially suppressed in the large time limit .",
    "therefore , one can hypothesize ( see an analogous case in @xcite , section c ) that also @xmath231 , when renormalizing , should obey an ode of the kind @xmath232 .",
    "hence , one expects to find @xmath233 when imposing the icv ( fixed here to @xmath234 ) at the end of the renormalization procedure .",
    "moreover , one also expects @xmath235 , a result that is even more predictable at this order , since we already verified that @xmath215 gives no contribution in the case of the substrate .",
    "correspondingly , we assume that these terms can be neglected in the present application of the spderg approach to mm kinetics .",
    "therefore , the function to be studied is further reduced to : @xmath236 as already recalled , in the context of the standard method , the mc that is verified by the adimensional substrate concentration does consistently also satisfy the matching of the inner and outer adimensional complex concentrations .",
    "for this reason , on the basis of the previously sketched analogy , we find not particularly surprising that , when making the transformations @xmath237 , the scaling condition @xmath238 gives again the same ode to be obeyed by @xmath239 as the one that we just found in the study of @xmath240 ( _ i.e. _ , eqs .",

    "interestingly , the curves shown in [ fig .",
    "[ fig8]a ] not only make once more evident that , in the case of the substrate , the spderg 2nd order uas we considered works definitely better than the pe 1st order ones , both with and without the refinement , but it also allows to naked - eye evaluate the range in which this happens .",
    "in fact , this range corresponds to @xmath367 , hence it covers about the @xmath368 of the whole relevant time window in the case without refinement , whereas it corresponds to @xmath369 ( with the larger time being of the same order of @xmath370 ) , and hence it covers about the @xmath371 of the whole relevant time window , in the case with the refinement . on the other hand , for @xmath372 ( [ fig .",
    "[ fig8]b ] ) , the refined spderg 2nd order ua appears to tend to zero slightly too rapidly , with respect both to the correct solution and to the pe 1st order result , though it makes a smaller error than the same spderg approximation without the refinement .    in the case of the complex , as already anticipated , the curves shown in [ fig .",
    "[ fig8]c ] make clear that the pe 1st order ua slightly over - evaluates the value of the maximum of this quantity .",
    "in fact , it appears to over - evaluate the dynamical behaviour of this quantity in the whole range @xmath373 , that is a time interval roughly centered around the maximum abscissa . on the other hand , both of the spderg 2nd order uas that we considered are successful in correctly capturing the maximum value of the complex numerical solution .",
    "in particular , the refined spderg approximation turns out to be the one more in agreement with the correct result up to the larger time @xmath374 , _ i.e. _ , in about the @xmath368 of the whole relevant time window .",
    "it is moreover both as much correct as the 1st order result of the standard method ( though going to zero slightly more rapidly than the correct solution ) and definitely better than the same approximation without refinement at large times . in particular",
    ", this is true for @xmath375 , that covers about a remaining @xmath376 of the whole relevant time window .",
    "nevertheless , the refined spderg approximation turns out to be the one that makes the largest error , by over - evaluating the correct complex concentration behaviour , in the remaining part of the relevant time window ( in detail , for @xmath377 ) .",
    "thus , the refined spderg 2nd order uas we proposed successfully capture the correct dynamical behaviour in a large part of the relevant time window , despite of the considered case being very demanding .",
    "first of all , this further confirms both the correctness and the utility of the spderg approach in general .",
    "moreover , these findings support the correctness of the present proposed way for obtaining asymptotically vanishing solutions , that exploits as much as possible the results , too . at least within our kind of spderg application procedure ,",
    "the proposed refined spderg uas appear easily generalizable to other similar cases . at the same time",
    ", the present analysis makes clear that the remaining part , to be analytically calculated , of the 2nd order outer contributions would be important for an approximation to mm kinetics , beyond the sqssa , that could work in the whole relevant time window , whatever the kinetic constants are , for values of the expansion parameter as large as @xmath378 .",
    "in the present work , we start by recalling the standard pe method in the case of mm kinetics , beyond the sqssa @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the method that is generally used to deal with the problem . against this background , we are able to successfully apply to this case the alternative spderg approach to boundary layer problems @xcite , by clarifying similarities and differences .",
    "the procedure that we choose for applying the approach makes use of a basic observation in @xcite , that the bare quantities to be effectively renormalized are the icvs of the problem ( in fact , here , the substrate one ) . by starting from the 1st order odes to be obeyed by the inner solutions , with icvs given at a generic time , and by performing the calculations up to the 2nd order , besides generally outlining the contribution of the single terms in the functions to the behaviours captured by the obtained approximations , we are able to show that one gets exactly the same outer component , as in the standard pe 1st order ua , for the substrate ( thus , as expected , also for the complex ) .    first of all , this result was not to be taken for granted .",
    "in fact , in the context of the boundary layer problems studied in the original works @xcite , the approach turned out to be able to possibly give not exactly the same terms as in the corresponding pe ua , but anyway a better approximation in the matching region . therefore , we interpret the outcome of the present study also as a further confirmation , from a very different point of view , of the correctness of the known pe results up to 1st order .    at the same time , within our application , the spderg approach turns out to make possible to correctly manage both the secular terms and the constant ones , without the imposition of mcs ( that in the present case , already at the 1st order , need in fact to be two term conditions , that involve the first derivatives of the outer solutions , too @xcite ) .",
    "actually , one can see an analogy between the present approach and the mcs of the standard method , since the key ingredient here , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fact that the renormalized part of the solution has to be independent of the arbitrary time @xmath137 , appears similar to the imposition of the mcs at an unknown time .",
    "then , one notices that , when imposing the mcs in the standard pe method , the one for the substrate needs to apply to the complex , too .",
    "thus , within this context , it appears expectable that , as we verified , the ode to be obeyed by the renormalized substrate icv is the only one to be obtained . in detail",
    ", we verified that the one found from the study of the substrate is the same as the one found in the case of the complex .    on the one hand , within the spderg approach",
    ", it is necessary to perform the calculations up to the 2nd order for recovering the 1st order outer contribution of the standard pe method . on the other hand , this allowed us to present the 2nd order contribution of the inner solutions for the first time to our knowledge .",
    "moreover , this also allowed us to hypothesize , by assuming that the observed solution behaviours could be iterated , that the constant terms at a given order , not to be renormalized , play the role of a part of the outer component at the following order .",
    "indeed , this appears equivalent to both the imposition of the first term of the mc and the need for cancelling one of the constant terms that appear twice in the ua , within the pe . in fact , it is reasonable to expect that this is a general characteristic of the spderg approach to boundary layer problems , at least in the present kind of application procedure , in which one directly renormalizes the bare icvs . in particular , this observation allowed us to propose refined spderg 2nd order uas , that contain the parts of the 2nd order outer components that are predictable on the basis of our hypothesis , and that are thus asymptotically vanishing , too .    the conclusive comparison among the best different approximations that we considered , in the more demanding case that we studied ( the one with the larger value of the expansion parameter , @xmath82 ) , shows that the time region in which the spderg approach at the 2nd order works better than the pe method at the 1st order , definitely encompasses the matching region .",
    "in fact , the obtained spderg approximations are nearly indistinguishable , within our numerical precision , from the correct solutions of the problem in about the first @xmath368 of the relevant time window . in detail",
    ", the extension of this region is slightly different for the substrate and for the complex , and it is in both of the cases larger when considering the refined uas .",
    "moreover , in the case of the complex , this last refined approximation works at least as well as the pe 1st order uas in a part of the relevant time window that also includes the large times .    actually , we studied particular demanding cases of mm kinetics .",
    "in fact , with the present kinetic constant choice , in logarithmic time scale , the curve for the substrate displays three inflection points instead of a single one already for values of the expansion parameter as small as @xmath379 .",
    "this observation appears related to an icv for the sqssa to the complex behaviour that , apart from being as usual larger than zero , is even larger than the maximum reached by the correct solution for this quantity .",
    "indeed , these qualitative observations would deserve a more careful study , that could allow a better understanding of the parameter s dependence of the relevant time scales in mm kinetics .    from a different point of view ,",
    "an interesting advantage of the present procedure for applying the spderg approach is that , at the 2nd order , one needs to solve a simpler ode for the 1st order outer component than the corresponding one in the standard method ( just because the other part of the outer contribution is already known ) .",
    "this could turn out to be particularly useful when attempting to apply the same procedure within the different framework of the tqssa since , despite of this framework being more largely applicable from the experimental point of view , the outer solution is not known explicitly at the 1st order and at the 0th order ( in any event , it is not known in terms of the lambert function ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we notice that , despite of their being quite technical and cumbersome , there is no particular difficulty in the present calculations . the performed detailed verifications , apart from being possibly better formalized in the future , can be in any event taken for granted in other similar cases , too .",
    "thus , the present results definitely support further applications of the spderg approach to boundary layer problems .",

    "<S> our main results are : i ) the 2nd order spderg uniform approximations to the correct solutions contain , up to 1st order , the same outer components as the known perturbation expansion ones ; ii ) the differential equation to be solved for the derivation of the 1st order outer substrate component is simpler within the spderg approach ; iii ) the approximations better reproduce the numerical solutions of the original problem in a region encompassing the matching one , because of the 2nd order terms in the inner components , calculated here for the first time to our knowledge : iv ) the refined spderg uniform approximations , that we propose , give the correct asymptotically vanishing solutions , too , and allow to obtain results nearly indistinguishable from the solutions of the original problem in a large part of the whole relevant time window , even in the studied unfavourable kinetic constant case , for an expansion parameter value as large as @xmath0 .    </S>",
