    "pep - ii is an asymmetric b - factory that consists of two separate rings with different energies .",
    "the electron and positron beams are brought into head - on collisions at the babar detector as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pepii - ip ] . in order to separate the beams fast enough away from the interaction point ( ip ) to avoid the deteriorating effect on the luminosity due to adjacent parasitic collisions , the beams go through many strong magnets inside the solenoid with very large offsets from their center .",
    "these offsets can be as large as a few centimeters as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pepii - ip ] .",
    "the excursion of the design orbit introduces large uncertainty into the optics near the ip .",
    "most problematic , the optics changes , as recently seen in the beam - beam experiments  @xcite , when the local orbit varies .",
    "an accurate optical model requires a map of three - dimensional magnetic field in the region . that is rather difficult to compute because of the overlapping fields and complicated geometry . as a first step",
    ", we will use the hard - edge model for the fringe field to estimate the effects analytically in this paper .",
    "the magnetic field of a single normal harmonics , including its fringe field , in the cylindrical coordinate is derived by bassetti and biscari  @xcite . to study the single - particle effects of the fringe field using hamiltonian system , we need to know its corresponding vector potential .      in the coulomb gauge , @xmath1 , the potential can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 for a skew multipole , the expression can be obtained by an exchange between sine and cosine . the coulomb gauge is chosen because its potential becomes the conventional multipole expansion .      for the solenoid , due to its axial symmetry , it is more convenient to choose the axial gauge : @xmath5 .",
    "the vector potential is given by @xmath6 the potential satisfies maxwell s equation @xmath7 .",
    "any truncation of the series could violate maxwell s equation .",
    "the magnetic field is given by @xmath8 .",
    "in the cartesian coordinate system , the hamiltonian , using the distance @xmath9 as the independent variable for a charged particle moving in a static magnetic field , is given by  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 are scaled components of the vector potential along axis x , y , s , respectively ; @xmath12 are the transverse canonical momenta scaled by a reference momentum @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the path length .",

    "the maps are obtained by simply switching the sign of the lie generator of the map .",
    "if there is a design off - axis orbit : @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the horizontal plane , the non - linear effects of the fringe field of a quadrupole magnet will feed down to linear optical errors . by substituting @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 into eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quadrupole ] ) , and extracting the quadratic terms of @xmath53 , we find that the tune shifts are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the courant - snyder parameters at the position of the edge . for pep - ii ,",

    "the nonlinear fringe transformation at quadrupole edges has been recently implemented in the lego code  @xcite .",

    "these effects were observed in pep - ii dynamic aperture calculations . to maximize luminosity ,",
    "the pep - ii horizontal tune is moved close to a half - integer .",
    "however , the tune space in this region is limited by the effects of half - integer resonance and its synchrotron side bands .",
    "the effect of the quadrupole resonances on pep - ii dynamic aperture had been observed in earlier tracking studies  @xcite . in this case , the resonance condition is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the synchrotron tune .    after including the nonlinear fringe in quadrupoles",

    "one can see that the fringe effect increases the on - momentum aperture but reduces the horizontal off - momentum aperture at .510 tune .",
    "the on - momentum improvement is due to the fringe compensation of the amplitude dependent tune shift from sextupoles .",
    "the off - momentum effect was attributed to the 1st octupole side band of the half - integer resonance excited by the fringe . in this case , the octupole resonance condition @xmath64 yields the resonance tune at @xmath65 . moving the tune away from this resonance to 28.518",
    "restored the aperture above the @xmath63 size .",
    "we have found a new lie generator for the hard - edge fringe due to a solenoid magnet . it is a fourth - order generator and gives an octupole - like kick to charge particles .",
    "it can also provide additional x - y couplings through an off - centered orbit .",
