    "reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) has become part of the standard toolkit for investigation of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . detailed comparison of broad emission - line flux variations and the continuum variations that drive them can be used to determine the structure and kinematics of the broad - line region ( blr ) under a rather simple and straightforward set of assumptions ( see horne 1999 and peterson 2001 for primers on reverberation mapping ) .",
    "agn emission lines are observed to respond roughly linearly to continuum variations , each line having a different range of time delays , @xmath8 . since reprocessing times are relatively short , the time delays are dominated by light travel time , @xmath9 where ( @xmath0,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) are spherical polar coordinates with @xmath12 along our line - of - sight beyond the compact continuum source at @xmath13 .",
    "iso - delay surfaces slice up the geometry of the emission - line region on a set of nested paraboloids . in the simplest linear reprocessing model ,",
    "the relationship between the continuum light curve , @xmath14 , and the emission - line profile variations , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 the `` transfer function , '' or `` velocity - delay map '' , @xmath17 is the response at velocity @xmath18 and time delay @xmath8 in the flux of emission line @xmath19 .",
    "the velocity - delay maps of various emission lines code information on the geometry , kinematics , and physical conditions in the blr .",
    "the immediate goal of reverberation mapping is to recover @xmath20 for each emission line by detailed fitting to variability recorded in high - quality time - resolved spectrophotometric data .",
    "the ultimate goal is to unravel the geometry , kinematics , and physical conditions in the blr .    to date ,",
    "the great success of reverberation mapping has been determination of the mean broad - line response times for approximately three dozen agns , in several cases for multiple lines in a single source ( see the compilation of kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . by combining the response times ( or `` lags '' ) with line widths and assuming that gravity is the dominant force acting on the line - emitting gas , a virial mass for the central black hole can be deduced .",
    "two lines of evidence suggest that these reverberation - based masses are reasonably accurate and actually do measure the black hole mass :    1 .   for agns in which the lags and widths of multiple lines have been measured , there is a clear anticorrelation between doppler line width @xmath21 and response time @xmath8 that is consistent with the virial prediction @xmath22 since @xmath8 measures the light - travel time across the blr ( peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson 2002 ) .",
    "lines that arise in higher ionization - level gas ( e.g. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are broader and have shorter response times than lines that arise primarily in lower ionization - level gas ( e.g. , , ] @xmath25 ) .",
    "2 .   comparison of reverberation - based black - hole masses and host - galaxy bulge velocity dispersons shows a relationship that appears to be the same as the black - hole / bulge velocity - dispersion relationship seen in quiescent galaxies ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "on the other hand , reverberation mapping has not yet achieved the motivating design goal of determining the actual geometry and velocity field of the blr .",
    "this is not surprising since inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) to solve for the velocity - delay map requires large amounts of high - quality spectra , which are difficult to obtain for agns",
    ". published attempts include analyses of ngc  4151 ( ulrich & horne 1996 ) , and ngc  5548 ( wanders et al .",
    "1995 ; done & krolik 1996 ) , both of which yielded rather ambiguous results .",
    "nevertheless , pursuit of the science goal of determining the blr structure is important :    1 .",
    "the origin of the blr emission remains one of the major mysteries of agns .",
    "there is no widely accepted paradigm for the nature of the blr .",
    "the blr clouds may represent the cooler and denser component of a two - phase medium in pressure and virial equilibrium ( krolik , mckee & tartar 1981 ) .",
    "alternatively , the blr clouds might be in virial motion , but magnetically confined ( rees 1987 ) .",
    "compelling arguments have been made that the broad emission arises as part of a massive outflow ( e.g. , chiang & murray 1996 ; bottorff et al .",
    "others have suggested that the broad emission arises in the extended atmospheres of stars ( e.g. , alexander & netzer 1997 ) or at least in part from the surface of the accretion disk itself ( e.g. , collin - souffrin et al .",
    "knowledge of the blr structure and kinematics is necessary to understand the potential systematic uncertainties in reverberation - based black - hole masses .",
    "this is especially interesting if indeed the outflow models are correct since the virial relationship @xmath22 is unexpected in simple outflow models .",
    "reverberation - based black - hole masses are now being used to anchor secondary methods of mass determination ( e.g. , laor 1998 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; vestergaard 2002 ) and it is therefore essential to understand how the measurements are affected by systematics .",
    "successful reverberation mapping requires a combination of high time resolution , long duration , homogenous high signal - to - noise data , and reasonably high spectral resolution .",
    "precise specification of these quantities depends on physical time scales of the source ( e.g. , blr light - crossing time ) and the character of the variations , which are neither simple nor regular .",
    "this makes experimental design difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the first generation of reverberation experiments have provided a great deal of insight on the continuum and emission - line variability properties of agns , making it possible to model their behavior through numerical simulations .",
    "detailed simulations can then be used to determine the observational requirements to map the blr .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to describe a program we have undertaken to define the requirements for recovery of high - fidelity velocity - delay maps from data obtained with a small uv / optical spectrophotometer . for the sake of realism , we have used as a model detector system that of a proposed multiwavelength observatory ,  ( polidan & peterson 2001 ) .",
    "the wavelength range and resolution and achievable signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath26 ) in these simulations are set by the specifications for .",
    "we have carried out two series of simulations , a comparatively simple first series , and a more realistic and complicated second series .",
    "the first series of simulations , discussed in  [ sec : series1 ] , addresses the use of velocity - delay maps for a single line , for example the  line , to distinguish among several alternative and currently viable models for the geometry and kinematics of the blr .    the second series , discussed in  [ sec : series2 ] ,",
    "is intended to be more realistic and challenging .",
    "we chose a model with a complicated yet plausible structure , specifically an inclined keplerian disk with a 2-armed spiral density wave superposed on it .",
    "we then used a photoionization equilibrium model appropriate for ngc  5548 ( kaspi & netzer 1999 ) to compute the anisotropic emissivity in each line at each point in the disk . in this series of simulations",
    ", we considered the response of multiple lines and constructed a model spectrum at each time to determine how blending of closely spaced lines ( e.g. , @xmath27 and @xmath24 ) affect the experimental results .",
    "each simulation is based on theoretical velocity - delay maps for one or more emission lines corresponding to a particular model for the blr , and on fixed observational parameters , e.g. , the sampling rate or time resolution @xmath28 , the experiment duration @xmath5 , and the @xmath26 per datum .",
    "the goal of the simulation is to define the extent to which `` observed '' velocity - delay maps , reconstructed from the simulated data sets , match the theoretical velocity - delay maps .",
    "each simulation consists of a number of individual realizations , corresponding to different detailed variations in the driving continuum light curve and different observational errors . for each realization , we ( a ) generate a model continuum light curve , ( b ) produce the corresponding model emission - line light curve from the model continuum light curve and the theoretical velocity - delay map , ( c ) select a simulated data set from pairs of points in the model continuum and emission - line light curves , ( d ) apply a suitable noise model to the simulated data , and ( e ) analyze the simulated data set by attempting to recover the velocity - delay map from it .",
    "many such realizations are carried out , and the recovered velocity - delay maps are compared with the original model to assess the fidelity of the process .",
    "the individual steps in these simulations are described below .",
    "theoretical velocity - delay maps were constructed for a variety of models . in the first series of simulations , the velocity - delay maps were selected to be broadly consistent with proposed models for @xmath29 in ngc  5548 based on the 1993 intensive monitoring program with",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) , the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( ) , and optical ground - based telescopes ( korista et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the specific models we consider are :    1 .   a spherical distribution of line - emitting clouds in circular keplerian orbits of random inclination , illuminated by an anisotropic continuum source ( wanders et al .",
    "1995 ; goad & wanders 1996 ) .",
    "2 .   a flat keplerian disk of clouds .",
    "3 .   a hydromagnetically driven wind ( bottorff et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the velocity - delay maps for these models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a common feature of these models is the broad similarity of their delay maps , i.e. , the line response integrated over doppler velocity @xmath30 which underscores the importance of making use of both velocity and delay information in determining the blr structure .",
    "the irregular variations of agn continua can be described in terms of a power - law power - density spectrum @xmath31 in our first set of simulations , we generate random light curves with these characteristics by using the method described by white & peterson ( 1994 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for each realization",
    ", a random value of @xmath32 is selected from a parent distribution with mean value @xmath33 and standard deviation @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "collier & peterson 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "each model light curve is then normalized such that the root - mean - square amplitude of the variations on a one - month time scale is approximately 16% . for the second set of simulations , we used a single light curve generated from a power spectrum with @xmath35 , and normalized to a 30% root - mean - square amplitude on a 200  day timescale . in both cases",
    "the resulting model continuum light curves resemble the observed uv continuum variations of well - studied agns .",
    "the line response is computed by convolving the model continuum light curve with the model velocity - delay map , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) .",
    "this is straightforward provided the delay interval used to sample the velocity - delay map is the same as the time interval  of the model light curves .",
    "after the convolution , an appropriate number of points at the beginning of the light curve is then removed so that even the first point in the line light curve is fully responding to the continuum variations .",
    "the velocity sampling @xmath21 used for the velocity - delay maps should equal or exceed the spectral resolution of the data .",
    "for the first series of simulations , the spectral sampling used was 2  ( i.e , @xmath36  at @xmath29 ) .",
    "for the second series , we used a spectral sampling roughly matched to the proposed  spectrographs , namely 0.7  ( 1 pixel , @xmath37  at ) for the uv lines , and 2.6  ( 1 pixel , @xmath38  at ) .",
    "for the optical lines .",
    "the resolution actually achieved in the velocity - delay maps can not exceed @xmath21 and @xmath28 , and is limited by the @xmath26 of the data in comparison with the variations recorded on different timescales in the light curves .      for each realization ,",
    "an artificial data set is created by sampling the model data in such a way as to mimic a real observational program .",
    "our principal goal is to find the combination of time resolution @xmath28 and experiment duration @xmath5 that are required to recover velocity - delay maps at a high level of confidence , so most of the simulations considered various combinations of these two parameters .    in some simulations , we eliminated at random or in groups some fraction of the data points to try to realistically estimate the effect of data losses .",
    "we found that for the large data sets that we considered , the results are fairly robust to gaps in the data provided a majority of the data points are retained .      to simulate observational errors , each sampled data point",
    "is altered by a random deviate drawn from a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and appropriate standard deviation .",
    "we assume that the objects to be studied are the relatively bright agns that have already been fairly well monitored . for such objects ,",
    "background noise and readout noise are insignificant and photon shot - noise is the only source of statistical uncertainty . in the case of a small spacecraft - based observatory such as , the limiting photometric accuracy will probably be determined by pointing and guiding errors . we have therefore adopted a very conservative flux minimum uncertainty of 1% for each data point .",
    "in the first series of simulations , we assume uncertainties of @xmath39% in continuum and @xmath40% in the emission lines , about the highest precision obtained in previous agn experiments . in the second series of simulations ,",
    "the statistical errors are based on the photon - counting statistics for a one - hour exposure with .",
    "the final step in each simulation is to attempt to recover the velocity - delay map from the simulated data set .",
    "this involves solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) , a classical inversion problem in theoretical physics . in the case of agn broad - line reverberation ,",
    "the data are relatively sparse and noisy , and usually irregularly sampled : for this reason , the original fourier quotient method proposed by blandford & mckee ( 1982 ) has never been applied successfully .",
    "these complications motivated development of a number of techniques , superior to fourier deconvolution , for recovering the observed transfer function @xmath20 from relatively poor quality data . these include the maximum entropy method ( mem ) of horne ( 1994 ) , the regularized linear inversion ( rli ) method of vio , horne , & wamsteker ( 1994 ) and krolik & done ( 1995 ) , and the subtractive optimally localized averages ( sola ) method of pijpers & wanders ( 1994 ) .",
    "our simulations utilize the mem formalism as implememented in the software package ` memecho ` , described by horne ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use ` memecho ` to fit the data set , defined by the sampled @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with a linearized echo - mapping model @xmath41 \\ , d \\tau \\ .\\ ] ] this differs from the linear model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) by the inclusion of `` background '' fluxes @xmath42 for the continuum , and @xmath43 for the line profile .",
    "these backgrounds account for approximately time - independent contaminating fluxes , including the host - galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum and narrow emission - line flux in the core of the emission line profile .",
    "we set the backgrounds to the mean line and continuum levels in the data .",
    "the velocity - delay map @xmath20 in the above model then represents the marginal responsivity ( i.e. , relative to the background levels ) to changes in the continuum .",
    "the linearized echo - mapping model is thus insensitive to mild non - linear line responsivities and affords an improvement over the simpler linear model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) .",
    "the mem fit proceeds iteratively , by varying model @xmath14 , @xmath20 , and @xmath43 to fit simultaneously the observed @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the `` smoothest positive maps '' , i.e. , the maps which maximize the entropy , for which @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the number of line and continuum measurements , defines a satisfactory fit to the data . the `` observed '' velocity - delay map @xmath20 that is recovered from the simulated data",
    "is then compared with the original model velocity - delay map .",
    "our first series of simulations has been described in some detail in a conference proceedings ( collier , peterson , & horne 2001 ) , so here we report on some highlights that illustrate our general conclusions .",
    "our first general finding supports the `` rule of thumb '' ( e.g. , press 1978 ) that the time series should be at least three times longer than the maximum time scale to be probed .",
    "the blr models used here have an outer radius @xmath46 light days ( varying slightly for the particular models ) so the longest timescale for response is @xmath47days .",
    "the velocity - delay maps recovered from the simulated data became recognizable and distinguishable from one another only with @xmath48 days of data , regardless of how fine a sampling grid is used .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the `` observed '' velocity - delay maps recovered from a simulation with duration @xmath49days and time resolution @xmath50day ( i.e. , at total of @xmath51 observations ) . in comparison with the corresponding theoretical maps in fig .  [ fig:1 ] , these `` observed ''",
    "maps are clearly somewhat blurred in both the delay and velocity dimensions .",
    "the finite resolution of the reconstructed maps is a limiting factor in their ability to distinguish among alternative geometric and kinematic models of the blr .",
    "high resolution maps require good sampling in time and velocity , and a sufficient signal - to - noise in the observations to detect the possibly quite small brightness changes that provide the information that defines the maps .",
    "comparison of figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] indicates that the resolution achieved in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is about @xmath52 day in @xmath8 and a few hundred km  s@xmath53 in @xmath18 .",
    "we consider this to be adequate to distinguish among the three models shown .    for somewhat coarser time resolution ,",
    "longer durations are required to achieve comparable fidelity , though fewer data points suffice : for results similar in quality to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , @xmath54day requires @xmath55days ( @xmath36 observations ) and @xmath56day requires @xmath57days ( @xmath58 observations ) .",
    "however , further increases in @xmath28 resulted in unacceptable loss of delay resolution in the velocity - delay map ; in these simulations the shortest time scales of interest were of order 2 days , so the resolution of the monitoring experiment must be finer than this .    at first glance",
    ", it appears that these requirements have been _ nearly _ met in previous reverberation - mapping programs , most notably the 1996 campaign on ngc  7469 ( wanders et al .",
    "1997 ) , which arguably represents the current state of the art .",
    "we test the verisimilitude of our simulations by reproducing the characteristics of this previous observing campaign .",
    "we therefore carried out the same simulation process , with minor changes made to mimic the characteristics of the  data .",
    "specifically , we adopted the following parameters : ( a ) @xmath59days , ( b ) @xmath60days , ( c ) continuum and emission - line flux uncertainties of 3% and 7% , respectively , ( d ) spectral resolution @xmath61 , and ( e ) continuum variations normalized to an amplitude of 12% on timescales of 10 days .",

    "[ fig:3 ] , which should be compared with the corresponding models in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the delay resolution of these maps is now @xmath62 days , owing mainly to the lower @xmath26 compared with the maps in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the quality of the velocity - delay maps that we obtain in these simulations is similar to the quality of the velocity - delay maps recovered from the real data .",
    "it is clear that the recovered velocity - delay maps based on simulations using -like parameters do not have sufficient @xmath26 and/or duration to distinguish between these two competing blr models .",
    "the second series of simulations is intended to be more challenging : the simulated data are more realistic and the blr structure is chosen to be rather complicated .",
    "the precise nature of the blr structure is less important than the fact that it is complex : the desired demonstration is that a complex system can be successfully mapped .      in these simulations ,",
    "the blr model we adopted is a population of @xmath63 discrete gas clouds on elliptical keplerian orbits around a black hole of mass @xmath64 .",
    "the orbital semi - major axes @xmath65 are populated with gas clouds uniformly distributed in @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 light days . the orbits all lie in a plane inclined at @xmath69 to the line of sight .    to generate a spiral wave pattern on the keplerian disk",
    ", we make the orbits elliptical , in this case eccentricity @xmath70 , and we `` twist '' the orbits by advancing the azimuth @xmath10 of the major axis with @xmath66 : @xmath71 the orbiting gas clouds spend most of their time near the apbothron , at @xmath72 .",
    "the twisting set of elliptical orbits thus generates a trailing spiral wave pattern , with the surface density of clouds on the face of the disk enhanced near @xmath73 to produce two such spiral arms , we simply rotate the orientation of the orbit of each cloud by @xmath74 with 50% probability .",
    "physical conditions in the clouds vary with their radial distance @xmath0 from the nucleus .",
    "we adopt a power - law model similar to that which kaspi & netzer ( 1999 ) employed in their attempt to fit the observed behavior of ngc  5548 during the 1989 monitoring campaign by the international agn watch ( clavel et al .",

    "we normalize the cloud population by summing over all clouds to obtain a total solid angle @xmath93 , and set the total covering fraction to @xmath94 .",
    "this simply scales the model line fluxes to roughly reproduce those observed in ngc  5548 ( kaspi & netzer 1999 ) .",

    "obscuration of one cloud by another is also ignored .",

    ". furthermore , there are few agns that can be observed continuously for periods longer than @xmath139days with an earth - orbiting observatory without the target getting too close to the sun for observation .",
    "the major result of this investigation is a clear demonstration that with technically realizable observational programs reverberation mapping can successfully recover even complex emission - line velocity - delay maps .",
    "previous reverberation mapping programs have had comparatively modest goals : generally , the intent has been to measure the mean response time for various emission lines . from these programs",
    ", we have learned enough about agn continuum and emission - line variability characteristics to carry out realistic simulations , such as those described here , that will define future programs with more ambitious goals .",
    "these simulations show clearly that even the most ambitious previous programs could not be expected to yield the results we now seek , i.e. , a complete velocity - delay map that can be used to identify the detailed structure and kinematics of the blr .",
    "we also conclude from these simulations that while high - fidelity reverberation mapping of even a single line will be a tremendous step forward , this will not yield the complete structure of the blr .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where the vivid colors arise because different emission lines probe different ranges of physical conditions and ionization level . to acquire a complete picture of the blr",
    ", a variety of lines spanning a broad range of ionization level ( and hence mean response time ) need to be mapped .",
    "moreover , it is distinctly possible that the high - ionization and low - ionization lines arise primarily in physically distinct regions with different geometries and kinematics ( e.g. , collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1988 ) ; if this is true , the need for reverberation mapping of multiple emission lines is self - evident .",
    "once we have acquired the data to make high - fidelity velocity - delay maps for different emission lines , how can we produce a map of the blr ? perhaps the simplest approach is though inspired modeling : practitioners recognizing the structure in the velocity - delay maps can devise appropriate models with adjustable parameters to obtain the best fit of a model to the data .",
    "a more ambitious program aims to reconstruct a complete phase - space map from the velocity - delay maps of different lines , or even directly from the data .",
    "this may be problematic , however , because the `` observable '' velocity - delay map is a two - dimensional projection of the six - dimensional phase space , so there are degeneracies .",
    "these can be partially resolved by combining results from multiple lines with photoionization equilibrium models , and some success has already been achieved with simple geometries ( horne 2001 , horne , korista , & goad 2002 ) .",
    "such methods will succeed best if the blr structure has some degree of simplifying symmetry , as we expect from most current models .",
    "but even if the blr is completely chaotic with no symmetries , this could be concluded from good reverberation data , and would provide us with an important answer about the inner structure of agns .",
