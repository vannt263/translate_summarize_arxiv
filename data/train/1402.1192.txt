    "nearly a decade ago a group of solar - type stars with @xmath0 magnitudes between 5.9 and 8.1 was selected to expand a photometric program that was designed to detect long - term spot cycles in dwarfs similar to the sun @xcite .",
    "although most of these moderately bright stars had radial velocities published in the literature , many did not . to remove binaries from the photometric sample",
    ", we obtained spectra and measured radial velocities .",
    "our spectroscopic observations soon identified five single - lined binaries , hd  100167 , hd  135991 , hd  140667 , hd  158222 , and hd  217924 , which we continued to observe .",
    "the basic properties of these binaries are given in table  [ tbl - basic ] .",
    "during the course of our extended spectroscopic observing campaign , others have also identified these five stars as binaries . from our observations we determine spectroscopic orbits and spectral and luminosity classes , measure iron abundances and @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 values , and then briefly discuss the systems .",
    "from 2002 through 2012 we obtained observations at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) with the coud feed telescope and coud spectrograph .",
    "the vast majority were acquired with a ti  ccd detector , and those spectrograms were centered at 6430   , cover a wavelength range of 84   , and have a resolution of 0.21    or a resolving power of just over 30,000 .",
    "the ti ccd was unavailable in 2008 september , and so a tektronics ccd , designated t1ka , was used instead . with that ccd the spectrum was centered at 6400   . although the wavelength range covered by the chip increased to 172   , the resolving power decreased to 19,000 . beginning in 2010 september we acquired spectra with a ccd , consisting of a 2600@xmath34000 array of 12 @xmath4 m pixels , that was made by semiconductor technology associates and designated sta2 . with sta2",
    "the spectrum was once again centered at 6430   , and the much larger size of the detector produced a wavelength range of 336   .",
    "the spectrograph slit was set so that the sta2 spectra have the same resolution as those acquired with the ti ccd although there is some worsening of the resolution at both ends of the sta2 spectra .",
    "all our kpno spectra have signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of about 150 .",
    "starting in 2006 , we collected additional spectrograms with the tennessee state university ( tsu ) 2 m automatic spectroscopic telescope ( ast ) and a fiber - fed echelle spectrograph , situated at fairborn observatory near washington camp in the patagonia mountains of southeastern arizona @xcite . through 2011",
    "june the detector was a 2048@xmath34096 site st-002a ccd with 15  @xmath4 m pixels .",
    "@xcite have discussed reduction of the raw spectra and their wavelength calibration .",
    "the ast echelle spectrograms have 21 orders that cover the wavelength range 49207100   , and most have an average resolution of 0.17    although a few have a slightly lower resolution of 0.24   .",
    "the s / n ratios ranged from 30 to 80 , being affected in part by significant temperature fluctuations of the dewar .",
    "beginning in 2010 january , we made several upgrades to the tsu 2 m ast to increase throughput , sensitivity , and flexibility .",
    "first , an entirely new focal plane assembly and guide system were constructed and installed , including a replacement for the fiber optic links between the telescope s focal plane and spectrographs . the new system increases the number of available fibers from three to a maximum of 12 , each terminated with industry - standard sma connectors , and enables the switching between fibers to occur in a matter of seconds .",
    "this configuration expands our flexibility and allows us to host guest instruments .",
    "the fibers connect to custom 1-inch aluminum mirrors , and the connector tine is flush with the front mirror surface .",
    "a nonpolarizing cubic customized 70/20 beamsplitter is placed before the mirror / fiber tip to redirect the smaller portion of starlight to a small ccd camera for direct guiding ; starlight reflected back from the mirror / fiber connector is redirected by the beamsplitter in the opposite direction , where a second ccd camera can similarly be used as a `` slit monitor '' and for guiding on brighter stars .",
    "second , an aluminum secondary mirror replaced the telescope s existing metal mirror , because the latter s protective coating had very significantly eroded with time .",
    "third , in the summer of 2011 the site ccd detector and dewar were replaced with a fairchild 486 ccd having 4k@xmath34k 15  @xmath4 m pixels , which required a new readout electronics package , and a new dewar with a cryotiger refrigeration system , which is consistently cooled at @xmath5 .",
    "overall , these improvements have increased the throughput by at least a factor of 30 .",
    "the echelle spectrograms that were obtained with this new detector have 48 orders , covering the wavelength range 38008260   . because different diameter fibers were used at times , the resolution was either 0.24 or 0.4   , which resulted in s / n ratios that ranged from 60 to 130 at 6000   . finally , a new temperature controlled building has been constructed to host guest instruments .",
    "it has two rooms , one , which measures 6 feet by 30 feet , to house the electronics systems and a second , which is 11 feet by 30 feet , to accommodate optics systems .",
    "the kpno velocities were determined by cross - correlation with respect to iau radial velocity standard stars of similar spectral type , @xmath6  vir , hr  7560 , and @xmath7  psc .",
    "the velocities adopted for those standards are from @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the measurement of the radial velocities from the fairborn observatory ast spectra .",
    "unlike the kpno velocities those from fairborn observatory are absolute velocities .",
    "our unpublished velocities of several iau solar - type standard stars indicate that the fairborn observatory velocities taken with the site ccd have a small zero - point offset of @xmath80.3 km  s@xmath9 relative to the velocities of @xcite . starting in the fall of 2011 ,",
    "velocities from spectra obtained with the new ccd system have a zero - point offset @xmath80.6 km  s@xmath9 relative to those of @xcite .",
    "thus , we added either 0.3 or 0.6 km  s@xmath9 , depending on which detector was used , to each measured velocity so that the zero point of the fairborn velocities is the same as that of the kpno velocities .",
    "for each of the five stars we first found a preliminary orbital period with the program pdfnd , which uses the least string method , implemented by t. j. deeming @xcite , to identify the period .",
    "we then computed a preliminary orbit for each star with the program bisp @xcite , which uses a slightly modified version of the wilsing - russell method .",
    "we refined those orbits with sb1 @xcite , a program that computes differential corrections .    for each star we determined separate solutions of the kpno velocities and the fairborn observatory velocities . from the ratio of the variances of the solutions",
    ", we then determined weights for the velocities from the two observatories and produced a final orbital solution , listed in table  [ tbl - orbele ] , with the combined set of velocities .",
    "@xcite identified several luminosity - sensitive and temperature - sensitive line ratios in the 6430 - 6465    region .",
    "they employed those critical line ratios and the general appearance of the spectrum as spectral - type criteria .",
    "however , for stars that are hotter than about early - g spectral class , the line ratios in that wavelength region have little sensitivity to luminosity .",
    "in those cases we have used the entire 84    spectral region of our kpno observations to estimate just the spectral classes of the individual components .",
    "the luminosity class may be determined by computing the absolute visual magnitude with the _ hipparcos _ parallax and comparing that magnitude to evolutionary tracks or a table of canonical values for giants and dwarfs .",
    "such a luminosity class that is not derived from the actual spectrum we note as ` dwarf ' rather than with the roman numeral luminosity class .",
    "our classifications are summarized in table  [ tbl - spty ] .",
    "we have determined @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 values from our red - wavelength kpno spectra with the procedure of @xcite . following @xcite , for late - f and g stars",
    ", we adopted a macroturbulent broadening value of 3 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the resulting projected rotational velocities are listed in table  [ tbl - spty ] .",
    "those @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 values have estimated uncertainties of 1 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "we determined the iron abundance for each of the five stars from our fairborn observatory echelle specta .",
    "our line list was taken from @xcite and includes between 34 and 45 fe  i lines for each star .",
    "all abundances were derived from equivalent width ( ew ) measurements with the use of the iraf ` splot ` package .",
    "table  [ tbl - ew ] shows the line list for each star along with the excitation potential ( ep ) , oscillation strength ( log@xmath10 ) , and measured width for each line .",
    "we obtained stellar model atmospheres for the stars by interpolating non - overshoot models in the atlas9 grid @xcite .",
    "the initial effective temperature @xmath11 and log@xmath10 values are from @xcite .",
    "we adopted the solar abundance of iron as the starting value in the atmospheric model for each star and chose an initial microturbulent velocity , @xmath12 , of 1.5 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "we used the model atmosphere as input to the lte line abundance analysis code moog , developed by @xcite .",
    "we then refined the parameters iteratively until there was no trend in fe i abundance as a function of reduced equivalent width or as a function of ep .",
    "an increase of 100 k in the adopted temperature increases the abundance by 0.06 dex . the best fit model parameters for each star and the derived [ fe / h ] abundances and standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) values are listed in table  [ tab::atmosabund ] .",
    "all five of our binaries are included in the geneva - copenhagen survey of solar neighborhood stars @xcite , which provided basic properties , including abundance estimates .",
    "@xcite derived an improved photometric iron abundance calibration using strmgren photometry and redetermined the iron abundances for the stars in that survey . in table",
    "[ tbl - abundcomp ] we compare their adopted effective temperatures and revised [ fe / h ] values with our results . on average",
    "our effective temperatures are 155 @xmath14 18 k higher resulting in the [ fe / h ] values being 0.12 @xmath14 0.03 greater than those of @xcite .",
    "one of our binaries , hd  100167 , has a previously determined spectroscopic iron abundance .",
    "@xcite found @xmath11 = 5915 k and [ fe / h ] = 0.06 for that star , values which are essentially identical to ours .",
    "the two main theories of orbital circularization and rotational synchronization ( e.g. , @xcite ) disagree significantly on absolute time scales but do agree that synchronization should occur first .",
    "observationally , @xcite examined the multiplicity of solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "they determined that while systems with periods @xmath1510 days had circular orbits , longer period orbits are generally eccentric . with periods ranging from 60.6 to 2403 days",
    "it is not surprising that the five binaries have significant eccentricities , which range from 0.20 for hd  140667 to 0.845 for hd  217924 .",
    "obviously , in an eccentric orbit true synchronization can not occur .",
    "however , for a non - circular orbit @xcite has shown that the rotational angular velocity of a star will tend to synchronize with that of the orbital motion at periastron , a condition called pseudosynchronization .",
    "with equation ( 42 ) of @xcite , we compute pseudosynchronous periods of 10.4 , 41.8 , 781.6 , 97.0 , and 132.2 days for hd 100167 , hd 135991 , hd 140667 , hd 158222 , and hd 217924 , respectively .",
    "@xcite included hd 100167 [ @xmath16 = 11@xmath17 31@xmath18 53.91@xmath19 @xmath20 = 412621.8(2000 ) ] in a velocity survey of late - type stars . from two observations they found it to have a variable velocity with an average of @xmath827.6 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite listed hd 100167 in another extensive compilation , the geneva - copenhagen survey of solar neighborhood stars . from two coravel observations they determined an average velocity of @xmath828.1 km  s@xmath9 and also identified the star as a binary .",

    "based on a comparison with a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks , @xcite determined an age of 6.8 gyr for hd 100167 , while @xcite found a likely age of 3.4 gyr .",
    "@xcite obtained ca ii h and k emission measurements from high resolution spectra and determined an age of 2.3 gyr . from the more recent activity  age calibration of @xcite ( their equation ( 3 ) ) the age",
    "is slightly increased to 2.7 gyr . also using stellar activity indicators",
    ", @xcite assigned a younger age of 1.58 gyr for hd  100167 .",
    "with 142 fairborn observatory velocities all phases of the very eccentric orbit of hd  100167 are well sampled .",
    "however , our 23 kpno radial velocities only partly cover the orbit with much of the very eccentric portion of the velocity curve missing .",
    "thus , in computing an orbit for the kpno velocities we fixed the semiamplitude at the value from the fairborn observatory solution .",
    "the center - of - mass velocities of the fairborn and kpno solutions differ by just 0.1 km  s@xmath9 , and the other elements are also in very good agreement , so we combined the two data sets , assigning weights of 1.0 and 0.15 to the fairborn and kpno velocities , respectively , and computed a final orbital solution .",

    "such a value is large enough to suggest that lines of the secondary might be visible at red wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , upon careful examination of our fairborn and kpno spectra , no lines of a secondary were detected , indicating that the magnitude difference between the components is greater than 2.5 @xcite .    from a calibration of ca  ii h and k emission measurements",
    "@xcite obtained a rotation period of 16 days compared with our pseudosynchronous period of 10.4 days . with the basic parameters in table  [ tbl - basic ]",
    "we obtain a radius of 1.08  @xmath24 from the stefan - boltzmann relation .",
    "then the 16 day period results in a rotational velocity of 3.4 km  s@xmath9 , while the shorter pseudosynchronous period produces a larger velocity of 5.3 km  s@xmath9 .",

    "this value is very different from the average value of @xmath827.5 km  @xmath9 found by @xcite .",

    "@xcite obtained ca ii h and k emission measurements from high resolution spectra and used a chromospheric activity calibration to determine a much younger age of 4.1 gyr , while the more recent activity  age calibration of @xcite ( their equation ( 3 ) ) increases the age to 4.9 gyr .",
    "with 152 fairborn observatory radial velocities all phases of the moderately eccentric orbit of hd  158222 are well sampled .",
    "although the 25 kpno velocities do not cover a small phase region around periastron passage , they still produce a good orbit .",
    "indeed , the orbital elements of the fairborn and kpno solutions are in excellent agreement , and in particular , the center - of - mass velocities differ by less than 0.1 km  s@xmath9 . with weights of 1.0 for the fairborn velocities and 0.7 for the kpno velocities ,",

    "the pseudosynchronous rotation period for hd  158222 is 97 days , and from the stefan  boltzmann relation we estimate a radius of 1.09  @xmath24 .",
    "those values result in a pseudosynchronous rotational velocity of 0.6 km  s@xmath9 , and so hd  158222 , although slowly rotating , is rotating faster than that value .",
    "@xcite classified hd  217924 [ @xmath16 = 23@xmath17 03@xmath18 50.59@xmath19 @xmath20 = 213553.8(2000 ) ] as g0  v. like the previous four binaries @xcite included hd  217924 in their extensive survey of solar neighborhood stars . from three coravel observations they found an average velocity of 19.1 km  s@xmath9 but with a standard deviation of 3.8 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "they concluded from the velocity variations that hd  217924 is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "they also estimated [ fe / h ] = @xmath80.34 and @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 = 3  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "as a result of a comparison of the _ hipparcos _ and tycho-2 proper motions , @xcite also flagged it as a binary .",
    "given the very large eccentricity of its orbit , the phase coverage , and the small number of orbital cycles that have been observed , there are two possible periods for hd  217924 , 2648 and 2403 days , depending on whether the first kpno velocity is placed on the descending or ascending part of the velocity curve , respectively . with the longer period all the other kpno velocities that were obtained before",
    "the fairborn observations were begun have large systematic residuals from the orbital fit . comparing the velocity residuals for orbits with the above two periods ,",
    "the sum of the weighted square of the residuals decreases by 45% for the orbit with the shorter period .",
    "thus , we have identified the period of 2403 days or 6.6 yr as the correct one .",
    "this period is by far the longest of the five binaries that we have analyzed .",
    "our 109 fairborn velocities nearly cover one orbital period and are well distributed in phase except for the very rapid nodal passage , which mostly took place when hd 217924 was behind the sun .",
    "fortunately , two observations were obtained after the star began its rapid velocity change from maximim to minimum velocity , significantly constraining the orbital elements .",
    "the 17 kpno velocities extend over nearly 1.5 orbital cycles and provide moderately good orbital phase coverage , but unfortunately , they completely miss the maximum velocity peak and the rapid velocity decline through periastron passage . as a result , those velocities by themselves",
    "do not enable the orbital solution of the elements to converge .",
    "however , adopting the elements from the fairborn velocities results in an excellent orbital solution of the kpno velocities .",
    "the two sets of velocities are listed in table  [ tbl-217924 ] . with weights of 1.0 and 0.3 for the fairborn and kpno velocities , respectively , these data produce the orbital solution given in table  [ tbl - orbele ] . our radial velocities and the computed radial velocity curve are compared in figure  5 .",
    "our spectral type for hd  217924 is g2  v , in reasonable accord with the g0  v type of @xcite .",
    "our projected rotational velocity of 2.2  km  s@xmath9 is similarly consistent with the value of 3  km  s@xmath9 determined by @xcite . despite its 6.6 yr orbital period , the orbital eccentricity of hd  217924 is so large , 0.84 , that the pseudosynchronous rotation period is just 132 days .",
    "nevertheless , such a period is long enough that like all but one of the other solar - type stars in this work , hd  217924 is rotating faster than its pseudosynchronous velocity .",
