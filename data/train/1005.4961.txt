    "the list of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) that are associated with supernovae ( sne ) has grown in the last decade ( e.g. , grb 030329/sn 2003dh  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; grb 031203/sn 2003lw  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; grb 060218/sn 2006aj  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; grb 050525a  @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , indicating that at least some ( perhaps most ) long - duration grbs result from the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "however , as evidenced by the failure to detect sne associated with two nearby long - duration grbs ( grb 060505 at redshift @xmath2 and grb 060614 at @xmath3 : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we do not yet have a complete understanding of the progenitors of long - durations grbs and the apparent origin of the diversity of their associated sn properties .",
    "long - duration grb 091127 ( @xmath4s , @xcite ) , presented us with a new opportunity to investigate the grb - sn connection .",

    "burst alert telescope @xcite on 2009 nov .",
    "27 at 23:25:45 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prompt emission had a power - law index of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 s post - burst ) and a fluence of @xmath8 erg @xmath9 ( 15 - 150 kev ) @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray telescope observed the x - ray afterglow with a photon spectral index of @xmath10 and absorption column of @xmath11 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "_ swift _ could not immediately slew to the burst due to earth - limb constraints , but an optical transient ( ot ) was quickly identified using the robotic 2-m liverpool telescope @xcite .",
    "_ swift _ ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot , @xcite ) observations , beginning @xmath12 min post - burst , confirmed the existence of this ot at ra@xmath13 = @xmath14 , dec@xmath13 = @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "gemini - north multi - object spectrograph ( gmos , @xcite ) and very large telescope x - shooter spectra of the ot revealed emission features from the underlying host galaxy of the grb at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "because of this relatively low redshift , grb 091127 was an excellent candidate for follow - up observations in search of a grb - related sn .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present optical data that show a late - time rebrightening in the ot of grb 091127 .",
    "we interpret this extra component of light as being due to a sn ( sn 2009nz , @xcite ) associated with grb 091127 .",
    "the observations , data reduction , and photometry are reported in  2 . in  3 , we consider each component of light associated with the ot and note the absence of reddening in the burst s host galaxy .",
    "we conclude in  4 with a comparison of past grb - sne . throughout this paper , we assume the standard cosmological model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and a hubble constant of 71 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 .",
    "we began observing the field of grb 091127 on 2009 nov . 28 at 01:15 , @xmath20 hr post - burst @xcite , using andicam ( a novel dual imaging camera ) mounted on the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) 1.3-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "initial smarts observations were obtained in short exposures over andicam s full wavelength range ( _ bvrijhk _ ) ; as the ot faded , longer observations were obtained with fewer filters . a thorough analysis of the afterglow of grb 091127 , including the full - color smarts dataset , is available in troja et al .",
    "( 2010 , in prep . ) . over 11 epochs between 1.8 hr and 24 days post - burst ,",
    "dithered images were obtained and then reduced and combined using standard iraf tasks ( see table 1 , fig .",
    "the brightness of the ot of grb 091127 was measured using seeing - matched aperture photometry relative to a set of on - chip , nonvariable sources .",
    "relative magnitudes were converted to apparent magnitudes by comparison , on a photometric night , with rubin 149 landolt standard stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to the relative measurement error , there is a systematic error of 0.05 mag associated with the uncertainties in this photometric calibration .",
    "all photometry in this paper is corrected for a galactic reddening of @xmath21 mag @xcite .",
    "we obtained images of grb 091127 using gmos on the 8-m gemini - south telescope .",
    "five epochs of gmos @xmath22-band imaging were obtained between 9 and 102 days post - burst ( see table 1 ) .",
    "each set of gemini images consisted of dithered exposures reduced and combined using the standard ` gemini.gmos ` iraf package .",
    "seeing - matched , relative aperture photometry was performed on the ot of grb 091127 .",
    "the relative to apparent magnitude transformation utilized two stars common to both the smarts and gemini images .",
    "the @xmath22-band apparent magnitudes of the stars were determined with the sdss transformation equations of @xcite , utilizing the stars @xmath23- and @xmath24-band smarts magnitudes .",
    "these gemini @xmath22-band magnitudes were then transformed back into the @xmath23-band to match the smarts photometric system . while these transformations may introduce some systematic error into the gemini photometry",
    ", they do not affect the relative magnitudes .",
    "the match between smarts and gemini values measured at similar epochs suggests that no significant error has been introduced .",
    "isis @xcite kernel - convolved image subtraction was carried out on the gemini images ( fig .",
    "the image obtained 102 days post - burst was used as the subtraction reference frame .",
    "residual light is evident in each subtracted frame , indicating that the ot was dimmest in the final image .",
    "this is expected , of course , if the earlier images contain afterglow light .",
    "however , both the image subtraction and the photometry indicate that the transient _ brightens _ by @xmath25 mag between 9 and 18 days post - burst .",
    "as described in  3 , we interpret this brightening to indicate the presence of an underlying grb - sn .",
    "uvot observations of grb 091127 began on 2009 nov .",
    "28 at 00:19:29 , 53.65 min after the trigger , and the afterglow was detected in all utilized filters .",
    "count rates were measured using @xmath26 apertures on data taken with the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 filters , and were calibrated using the uvot photometric system described by ( * ? ? ? * see table 1 ) .",
    "the ot of grb 091127 consists of three distinct sources of light .",
    "the first source is the steady contribution from the underlying host galaxy , which dominates at late times ( @xmath30 days ) .",
    "the second source , most important at early times ( @xmath31 days ) , is the decaying optical afterglow ( oag ) of the grb .",
    "the third source is the rising and then decaying light from the putative sn associated with grb 091127 , sn 2009nz , which begins to contribute significantly to the system several days post - burst .",
    "below , we consider each of these contributions in turn .",
    "we assume that in the final gemini image ( @xmath32 days post - burst ) , all transient sources associated with grb 091127 no longer contribute significantly to the observed optical flux .",
    "therefore , we take the magnitude at that epoch ( @xmath33 mag ) to be the brightness of the host . if a small contribution of extra light from the oag or sn is still present in our images at this epoch , then we may have overestimated the brightness of the host ; thus , we will have oversubtracted the host contribution and slightly underestimated the peak brightness of the grb - sn associated with grb 091127 .",
    "we estimate that the systematic uncertainty in the sn peak brightness introduced by host - galaxy subtraction is @xmath34 mag .",
    "the host galaxy of grb 091127 exhibits a nonstellar radial profile ( full width at half - maximum intensity @xmath3510 when the seeing was 07 ) , with a slight elongation from northwest to southeast .",
    "the centroid of the ot is offset from the host - galaxy center by 0@xmath3601 west and 0@xmath3701 south .",
    "the position of the grb is , therefore , inconsistent with the center of the galaxy . at the distance of the host ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "@xmath38 is 6.02 kpc in projection .",
    "thus , the grb occurred @xmath39 kpc from the host center , which is a typical offset for a long - duration grb @xcite .",
    "smarts observations were obtained with a cadence designed to ensure that the final combined frames in each filter are referenced to the same mid - exposure time .",
    "images obtained during the first smarts epoch have a common mid - exposure time of 2.2 hr post - burst .",
    "the oag was brightest during this epoch , so we use these data to build the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the afterglow in order to evaluate whether there is significant extinction along the line - of - sight through the grb host galaxy .    to help constrain the host reddening ,",
    "we extend the sed blueward of the smarts _ b_-band filter using _",
    "swift_-uvot ultraviolet observations .",
    "the uvot light curve was best sampled in the @xmath27 filter , and a power - law fit to the data yield a decay slope of @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the transient s flux density and @xmath43 is the time since the burst trigger ) , consistent with the decay rates inferred from smarts @xcite and skynet / prompt @xcite observations at similar times . assuming this decay rate , uvot magnitudes were extrapolated to the common time of 2.2 hr post - burst ( @xmath44 mag , @xmath45 mag , @xmath46 mag ) in order to match the smarts epoch .",
    "figure 3 shows the smarts / uvot sed of the oag of grb 091127 .",
    "after correction for galactic extinction , the observed uv - optical - ir sed was fit assuming an intrinsic power law affected by an extinction screen at the host redshift of 0.49 .",
    "we examined several models , including milky way - like extinction , smc - like extinction , and lmc - like extinction using the parameterization of @xcite .",
    "the data were also fit to an unextinguished power law",
    ". fits with a small amount of host - galaxy extinction were statistically acceptable , as was the fit to the unextinguished case .",
    "given that the addition of host - galaxy extinction does not significantly improve the model fit , we suggest there is little to no significant extinction along the line - of - sight to grb 091127 .",
    "the @xmath47 upper limit on host - galaxy extinction is @xmath48 mag .",
    "if a small amount of extinction is present in the host galaxy , we will slightly underestimate the peak brightness of the sn associated with grb 091127 .",
    "the decay of the oag of grb 091127 is modeled by a broken power law . during the first three epochs ,",
    "the power - law decay index calculated from the smarts @xmath23-band observations is @xmath49 . at @xmath50 days post - burst ,",
    "the power law steepens to @xmath51 .",
    "this decay index is similar to that reported in other optical filters @xcite .",
    "observations taken up to 6 days post - burst are dominated by the oag .",
    "the transient s behavior in later epochs , however , deviates significantly from this power - law decay .",
    "this late - time deviation may , in part , be due to light from the underlying host galaxy , so we subtract the host - galaxy contribution ( see table 1 ) . at early times , this subtraction has very little effect on the brightness of the transient , but it does slightly steepen the later - time decay rate of the afterglow to @xmath52 . despite this subtraction , the transient",
    "still does not behave as expected for a very late - time oag . instead of following a power - law decay , the transient _",
    "brightens_.    it is not uncommon for an afterglow to brighten , though this usually occurs during its early - time evolution during or immediately after the prompt phase of the grb @xcite .",
    "optical flaring is also relatively common and is generally attributed to refreshed shocks or reverse shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the oag of grb 091127 shows no indications of significant brightening or flaring at early times @xcite .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of grb 091127 also shows no flaring activity at early times and does not deviate from a simple power - law decay when the ot brightens .",
    "the brightening occurs several weeks post - burst and , therefore , can not be easily attributed to grb central - engine activity . when a late - time rebrightening with a similar timescale to that of grb 091127 has been observed following a grb ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the light curve `` bump '' has been attributed to a sn that occurred concurrently with the grb .      to examine the late - time brightening component of grb 091127 ,",
    "both the host galaxy and oag contributions are subtracted ( see table 1 , fig . 1 , _",
    "inset _ ) . to account for possible errors , a range of subtractions",
    "was implemented assuming every possible permutation of a @xmath53 error on the host brightness and the afterglow model .",
    "this @xmath47 confidence region is shown as the gray area in the inset of figure 1 and likely overestimates the actual errors on the sn associated with grb 091127 .",
    "variations in the assumed host - galaxy magnitude most strongly affect the brightness of the late - time observations , while changes in the fit to the afterglow alter the earlier - time observations .",
    "regardless of the exact values assumed for the host galaxy and oag subtraction , the classic rise and then decay of a sn is clear .",
    "the observed peak magnitude of sn 2009nz is @xmath54 mag , which occurs at @xmath55 days post - burst . at the burst s redshift of 0.49 ,",
    "this is equivalent to an absolute peak magnitude of @xmath1 occurring at a rest - frame time of @xmath56 days post - burst . for these calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the k - correction of this grb - sn is similar to that of the prototypical grb - sn , sn 1998bw , and employ a time - dependent , generalized k - correction @xcite that utilizes the spectra of sn 1998bw from @xcite and the photometry of @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath23-band light curve of sn 1998bw at @xmath16 is shown as a curve in the inset of figure 1 .",
    "the sn associated with grb 091127 evolves faster than sn 1998bw , and reaches a slightly dimmer peak magnitude .",
    "this peak magnitude could be brighter if the sn has been reddened by its host galaxy ; the @xmath47 upper limit on reddening is @xmath48 mag and , therefore , extinction is unlikely to alter the peak magnitude by more than a few tenths of a magnitude .    given the resemblance between sn 1998bw and the extra component of late - time light in grb 091127 , alternatives to the sn explanation for the source of this light are difficult to support . while it was initially speculated that some late - time grb optical afterglow rebrightenings might be attributed to `` dust echos '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , later analysis concluded that these models could not fit the data and sne were much more natural explanations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , similar late - time `` bumps '' in the oag light curves of other grbs ( e.g. , grb 021211 , @xcite ; grb 050525a , @xcite ) have been shown spectroscopically to be grb - sne .",
    "hence , we consider our observations to be an extremely strong photometric case for a sn associated with grb 091127 .",
    "we compare the absolute @xmath57-band light curve of sn 2009nz with other grb - sne whose sn light curves can be separated from their oags ( sn 1998bw / grb 980425 , sn 2003dh / grb 030329 , sn 2003lw / grb 031203 , and sn 2006aj / grb 060218 ; see fig .",
    "4 ) . the grb - sne are globally very similar in terms of rise times and peak magnitudes .",
    "the grb - sne cluster fairly tightly in peak brightness , though sn 2003lw appears to be somewhat brighter than the others . the exact peak magnitude of sn 2003lw",
    ", however , depends on a large and uncertain amount of galactic and host - galaxy extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "depending on the reddening values assumed , sn 2003lw may be up to 0.5 mag dimmer than shown in figure 4 , thus making its peak brightness more in line with the other grb - sne .",
    "the light curve of sn 2003dh is also subject to some uncertainty because of the difficulty of separating the sn component of grb 030329 from its very bright oag @xcite .",
    "a significant variation among the grb - sne is their rise times , with sn 2006aj peaking the fastest and sn 2003lw taking the longest time to peak .",
    "there appears to be a trend toward brighter grb - sne evolving more slowly than fainter grb - sne @xcite .",
    "for every 0.1 mag of dimming ( brightening ) compared to the peak brightness of sn 1998bw , the grb - sne evolve @xmath58 more quickly ( slowly ) .",
    "this trend , however , has an unknown amount of associated error given the uncertainties associated with the light curves of sn 2003lw and sn 2003dh and the relative sparsity of @xmath57-band data points for sn 2003lw and , therefore , may not be significant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "considering the similarities in the light curves of sn 1998bw and sn 2009nz , it is likely that they ejected comparable amounts of @xmath59ni ( 0.50.7 m@xmath60 , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the similarities between these two sne are particularly interesting because of the large disparity between the gamma - ray energy associated with grb 980425 and grb 091127 .",
    "grb 980425 was a particularly subluminous grb , with @xmath61 ergs , while grb 091127 was a much more energetic burst with @xmath62 ergs @xcite .",
    "even if grb 091127 was highly collimated , the gamma - ray energy output of grb 091127 corrected for beaming is still at least a few orders of magnitude larger than that of grb 980425 . while there is evidence of a large population of local , low - energy , long - duration grbs without significant oags that are associated with sn 1998bw - like sne ( see @xcite ) , grb 091127 with its large @xmath63 and bright oag is not a member of this class . instead ,",
    "grb 091127 is much more similar to grb 030329 ( associated with sn 2003dh ) .",
    "the addition of another member to the class of grb - sne associated with `` typical '' energy , cosmological grbs provides strong supporting evidence that many , if not most , long - duration grbs are produced by the core collapse of massive stars .",
