    "mass accretion onto a black hole binary ( bhb ) produces energetic astrophysical phenomena .",
    "bhbs are largely classified into two distinct states : the high / soft and the low / hard state ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "mass accretion is believed to be provided by the stellar wind from the companion star for high - mass x - ray binaries , while it is caused by roche lobe overflow for low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "x - ray absorption features have been observed from both systems , and interpreted as the absorption by the disk wind , the stellar wind , or the hot spot on the disk .",
    "such an absorption feature can be crucial to probe the global structure of accretion flow that is presumably related to the differences between two states .",
    "cyg x-1 is a famous bhb , and belongs to one of the high - mass x - ray binaries ( oda et al .",
    "1971 , tananbaum et al .  1972 ) .",
    "it has an o9.7 iab supergiant , hd 226868 ( caballero - nieves et al .",

    "2011 , xiang et al .",
    "2011 ) , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( orosz et al .  2011 ) , respectively .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath10 days ( brocksopp et al .",
    "since hde  226868 almost fill its roche lobe in cyg x-1 ( gies & bolton 1986 ) , the stellar wind is not spherically symmetric but strongly enhanced towards the bh ( `` focused wind '' ; friend & castor 1982 ) .",
    "the stellar wind causes episodes of increased absorption , or `` dips '' , which are seen as a decrease in soft x - ray flux ( e.g. , pravdo et al .",
    "1980 ; kitamoto et al .",
    "1984 ) mostly at near the superior conjunction of the bh ( when the observer , the companion star , and the bh are lined in this order ) . in long - term continuous monitoring with _ rxte _ ,",
    "these dips have rarely been seen in the high / soft state in contrast to the frequent occurrence in the low / hard state ( wen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the detailed studies on the absorption feature have been realized with _",
    "chandra _ hetg observation of cyg x-1 in several orbital phases @xmath11 and states ; e.g. , @xmath12 ( schulz et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath13 ( hanke et al . 2009 ) in the low / hard state , @xmath14 ( miller et al . 2005 ) in the intermediate state , and @xmath15 ( chang & cui et al .",
    "2007 ) and @xmath13 ( feng et al . 2003 ) in the high / soft state . despite these observations ,",
    "the differences in absorbing matter between the low / hard state and high / soft state are poorly understood , due probably to fewer observations in the high / soft state .",
    "cyg x-1 usually stays in the low / hard state , though it recently has changed into the high / soft state since the middle of 2010 .",
    "thus , we observed cyg x-1 twice with _ suzaku _",
    "( mitsuda et al .  2007 ) in the high / soft state , and found clear absorption features at around the fe - k band in the latter observation performed at @xmath16 . in this letter , we report the detection of the he - like fe k@xmath0 absorption line with _ suzaku _ and its full evolution . unless otherwise stated , errors refer to 90% confidence limits .",
    "cyg x-1 was observed with _ suzaku _ on 2010 december 16 ( obs .  1 ; obsid=905006010 ) and 2011 october 5 ( obs .  2 ; obsid=406013010 ) .",
    "the corresponding orbital phases are @xmath17@xmath18 for obs .  1 and @xmath19@xmath20 for obs .  2 , assuming that an epoch of the superior conjunction of the bh is mjd@xmath21 based on brocksopp et al .",
    "the xis employed the 1/4 window option and a burst mode of 0.5 s ( koyama et al .",
    "2007 ; see serlemitsos et al .",
    "2006 on the x - ray mirror ) .",

    "although cyg x-1 was believed to stay mostly in the low / hard state , it has been in the high / soft state ( the hardness ratios @xmath22 ) over the last two years .",
    "the first and second observation were performed during the high / soft state as indicated in figure  1a .",
    "the data processing and reduction were performed by using the _ suzaku _ pipeline processing ver.2.7.16.30 .",

    "the reason that the exposure of the xis is shorter than that of the hxd is due to utilizing the burst option ( live time fraction of 25% ) and discarding the period that the telemetry of the xis is saturated .",
    "we subtracted the modeled non - x - ray backgrounds ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2009 ) from the hxd spectra , while did not subtract the background from the xis spectra because the background is less than @xmath24% in any energy bands below @xmath1 10 kev .",
    "we used a standard set of the response files and auxiliary files ; i.e. , ones generated by running xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen ( ishisaki et al .",

    "we estimated pileup effects on the xiss and excised the image core within a pileup fraction larger than 3% ( @xmath25 ) according to the empirical criteria ( yamada et al .",

    "we perform in this letter the analysis of the xis0 data in obs .  2 to concentrate on the absorption features .",
    "note that such an absorption feature can be seen in the xis3 and xis1 spectra , but the xis3 is operated on timing mode , and the xis1 is a backside illuminated ccd , which make it hard to treat all the xiss in a comprehensive manner , especially under conditions being affected by pileup .",

    "the similar trend is reported in the previous study ( e.g. , feng et al .",

    "as expected , the absorption line is gradually deepening from ew @xmath1 10 ev to ew @xmath1 60 ev towards phase  c , and then becoming to ew @xmath1 20 ev .    for a detailed analysis of the absorption line , we used a voigt profile implemented in xspec as a local model of kabs ( ueda et al .",
    "2004 , and see also kubota et al . 2007 ) which has three fitting parameters of the ion column density @xmath42 , the radial velocity dispersion @xmath43 , and a redshift for bulk motion @xmath44 . since the value of @xmath43 can not be well constrained by the line profile , we fixed @xmath43 at 100 km s@xmath27 .",

    "such a highly ionized fe - k absorption line has rarely been detected though the dips occurs more frequently than in the high / soft state .",

    "however , the number of the photons in energies above @xmath1 7 kev in the low / hard state is more than that in the high / soft state .",
    "this implies that there could be some geometrical effects , such as an accretion stream and changes in the scale heights of the x - ray emitting coronae ( wen et al .",
