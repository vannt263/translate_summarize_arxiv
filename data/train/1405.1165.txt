    ", @xmath138 has a positive limit @xmath261 at infinity .",
    "using the equation , we see that @xmath262 , hence @xmath263 .",
    "next , following  @xcite , we look at @xmath264 which solves the equation @xmath265 at infinity we have @xmath266 , hence @xmath267 , which easily leads to a contradiction .",
    "we conclude that @xmath244 vanishes and we denote by @xmath252 its first root .",

    "second , if @xmath270 , then @xmath244 is negative for small @xmath271 ( due to the fact that @xmath272 ) . since @xmath273 ( otherwise @xmath274 and @xmath138 is constant )",
    ", we see that @xmath138 must attain a local minimum at @xmath252 . from the equation  , this yields @xmath275 and hence @xmath276 , which implies @xmath253 .",
    "finally we prove that @xmath225 is open .",
    "we already know that @xmath277 .",
    "let then @xmath278 .",
    "for @xmath279 in a neighborhood of @xmath183 , @xmath280 possesses a local minimum at @xmath281 at which @xmath282 . since @xmath283",
    ", we get @xmath284 for all @xmath285 and some @xmath286 , and therefore @xmath287 .",
    "let now @xmath288 be the unique solution to @xmath289 the main remark is that @xmath290 is the variation of @xmath138 with respect to the initial condition @xmath217 , which implies the following result    assume that @xmath227 and that @xmath291 when @xmath292 .",
    "then there exists @xmath286 such that @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "this is  ( * ? ? ?",

    "choose first @xmath295 such that @xmath296 on @xmath297 , and then @xmath298 such that @xmath299 for all @xmath300 .",
    "finally , choose @xmath301 such that @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "for @xmath304 , we then have @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "the function @xmath307 is negative at @xmath308 with @xmath309 . if @xmath310 or if @xmath287 , then @xmath311 must tend to @xmath103 or become positive at some point , and therefore it must have a first local ( strict ) minimum at some point @xmath312 , with @xmath313 for all @xmath314 .",
    "from the equation   we can then write @xmath315 for some @xmath316 . here",
    "@xmath317 because of our assumption that @xmath318 and @xmath319 by choice of @xmath320 .",
    "now @xmath321 and @xmath322 , which is a contradiction .",
    "the argument is the same for @xmath323 .",
    "the lemma implies that any @xmath227 for which @xmath324 diverges to @xmath325 must be an isolated point .",
    "now , if we can prove that @xmath326 for all @xmath227 then we would clearly be done . indeed , we know that @xmath225 and @xmath230 are open and they can only be separated by points in @xmath327 .",
    "but the lemma says that points in @xmath327 can only serve as a transition between @xmath225 below and @xmath230 above .",
    "therefore , there can be only one such transition , and we conclude that @xmath327 is reduced to one point .",
    "so our goal will be to prove that all the points in @xmath327 have @xmath326 .",
    "our argument will be based on the wronskian identity @xmath328 for various functions @xmath329 s .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath332 these three test functions correspond respectively to variations of @xmath166 using multiplication by a constant , dilations and translations .",
    "[ lem : v_has_one_root ] for every @xmath227 , the function @xmath288 vanishes exactly once .    for simplicity",
    "we denote again @xmath236 and @xmath333 .",

    "as we have said @xmath345 vanishes at @xmath339 and it is decreasing , hence @xmath346 for @xmath343 .",
    "however @xmath347 decays exponentially at infinity and hence @xmath348 for @xmath271 large enough . using",
    ", this proves that @xmath349 .",
    "therefore @xmath350 diverges to @xmath325 exponentially at infinity , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath351 .",
    "next , the proof that @xmath192 can only vanish once is the same as in  @xcite",
    ". indeed , start with @xmath352 at which the solution @xmath353 is stationary .",
    "the function @xmath354 vanishes exactly once since @xmath355 decreases from @xmath356 to 0 .",
    "taking @xmath357 and using that @xmath358 can not have double zeroes gives that @xmath192 can vanish at most once .",
    "we are now able to show that @xmath192 and @xmath350 diverge to @xmath325 .",
    "let @xmath227 . then @xmath359 and @xmath360 diverge to @xmath325 as @xmath160 .    for simplicity",
    "we denote again @xmath236 and @xmath333 .",
    "let @xmath361 be the unique root of @xmath192 , at which we must have @xmath362 .",

    "then we have from   @xmath366 next we remark that the function @xmath367 vanishes both at @xmath339 and at @xmath368 .",
    "therefore , its derivative must vanish at least once on @xmath369 , that is , @xmath370 vanishes before @xmath361 . since @xmath138 is strictly decreasing , and since @xmath371 vanishes only once by lemma  [ lem : prop_f ] , we conclude that @xmath372 is negative for @xmath373 , hence @xmath367 is strictly decreasing after @xmath361 .",
    "in particular , @xmath374 since @xmath375 and @xmath376 go to 0 exponentially at infinity , we conclude that @xmath377 must diverge .",

    "@xmath214 is strictly decreasing , as we have shown before , hence @xmath215 can only have one root .",
    "the linearized operators at our solution @xmath400 are defined by @xmath401 and @xmath402 more precisely , the linearized operator is @xmath403 .",
    "the operator @xmath404 describes variations with respect to @xmath38 for real functions , whereas @xmath405 is related to the invariance of our problem under multiplication by a phase factor .",
    "it is easy to verify that both @xmath404 and @xmath405 are self - adjoint operators on @xmath115 , with domain @xmath406 and form domain @xmath37 .",
    "the main result of this section is    [ thm : non - degenerate ] in @xmath115 , we have @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "the operators @xmath404 and @xmath405 both satisfy the perron - frobenius property that their first eigenvalue , when it exists , is necessarily non - degenerate with a positive eigenfunction .",
    "this follows for instance from the fact that @xmath409 and from harnack s inequality  ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 , thm 5 ) which gives the strict positivity of eigenfunctions .",
    "since @xmath410 and @xmath38 is positive , we deduce that it must be the first eigenfunction of @xmath405 , and that it is non - degenerate .",
    "thus @xmath408 . next , in dimension @xmath47",
    ", we know that @xmath411 and @xmath412 has a constant sign . hence , @xmath103 is the first eigenvalue of @xmath404 and it is non - degenerate which implies @xmath413 .",
    "the argument for @xmath404 in dimension @xmath161 is slightly more complicated .",
    "a lengthy but straightforward computation shows that @xmath414 since @xmath415 , the multiplier @xmath416 is bounded away from @xmath103 and we deduce that @xmath417 if and only if @xmath418 . hence @xmath419 if and only if @xmath420 .",
    "the argument is now classical .",
    "the operator @xmath421 commutes with space rotations and it may be written as a direct sum @xmath422 corresponding to the decomposition @xmath423 with @xmath424 the @xmath425th eigenspace of the laplace - beltrami operator on the sphere @xmath426 . in dimension @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath427 where @xmath428 are the usual spherical harmonics .",

    "each @xmath429 has the perron - frobenius property .",
    "since @xmath433 and @xmath434 has a constant sign , we conclude that @xmath103 is the first eigenvalue of @xmath435 and it is non - degenerate , thus @xmath436 .",
    "next , for @xmath437 , we simply use that @xmath438 in the sense of quadratic forms , which shows that the first eigenvalue of @xmath429 must be positive and hence @xmath439 .",
    "finally , for @xmath431 , the operator @xmath440 was studied in theorem  [ thm : radial ] , where we proved that the unique solution to @xmath441 with @xmath442 diverges exponentially at infinity , hence can not be in @xmath443 .",
    "we have therefore shown that @xmath444 since @xmath445 , this says that @xmath446 which concludes our proof of theorem  [ thm : non - degenerate ] .",

    "the proof is tedious but elementary .",
    "it relies on the fact that @xmath99 is an algebra and that all the functions appearing in the definition of @xmath477 are polynomials in the unknowns @xmath484 .",

    "the operator is an isomorphism from @xmath99 to @xmath490 and the same holds in the radial subspaces @xmath486 and @xmath487 .",
    "similarly , the operator @xmath491 is the fourier multiplier with the matrix @xmath492 and we claim that @xmath493 for all @xmath494 and all @xmath495 .",
    "this estimate shows that the corresponding map is bounded on @xmath99 , as needed . in order to prove  , we recall that @xmath496 changing @xmath497 into @xmath498 , it suffices to show that x@xmath499 for all @xmath500 , with @xmath501 the matrix @xmath502 has two real positive eigenvalues @xmath503 and @xmath504 with @xmath505 .",
    "hence @xmath506 as a consequence , @xmath507 , for all @xmath494 and for all @xmath495 .",
    "finally , the fact that @xmath482 is also continuous can be proved with the same arguments .",

    "let @xmath514 a nontrivial solution to @xmath515 . then , since @xmath516 is bounded , @xmath517 and @xmath518 solves @xmath519 a calculation shows that the radial function @xmath329 solves @xmath520 where @xmath404 is the linearized operator defined in  . since the restriction of @xmath404 to radial functions is invertible by theorems  [ thm : radial ] and  [ thm : non - degenerate ] , we conclude that @xmath521 and @xmath513 is one - to - one .",
    "next , we observe that @xmath513 can be written as the sum of two linear operators @xmath522 as we have already said before , the upper part of the operator @xmath523 is a restriction of the dirac operator @xmath524 and it is an isomorphism from @xmath486 to @xmath487 , by definition of these spaces . on the other hand , @xmath525 is compact .",
