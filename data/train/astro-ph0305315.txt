    "the galactic bulge ( gb ) is the nearest bulge in which individual stars can be studied in detail .",
    "a study of stellar populations and stellar dynamics in the bulge may help us understand how bulges formed , what are their populations , gravitational potential and structure .",
    "the proper motions with precise photometry might make it possible to separate the observed populations based on their kinematics .",
    "such study has first been done by @xcite with photographic plates only for a few hundred of brightest red giants in baade s window .",
    "recently deeper study has been done by @xcite with _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst)/wfpc2 in baade s window .",
    "several groups have carried out gravitational microlensing observations toward dense stellar fields , such as the magellanic clouds , the galactic center and disc . until now ,",
    "hundreds of events have been found ( eros : @xcite ; ogle : @xcite ; @xcite ; macho : @xcite ; moa : @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thousands are expected in the upcoming years by moa , ogle - iii and other collaborations .",
    "it is well known that the gravitational microlensing survey data is well suited for numerous other scientific projects ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the studies of the galactic structure certainly benefit from this type of data .",
    "the microlensing optical depth probes the mass density of compact objects along the line of sight and the event time - scale distribution is related to the mass function and kinematics of the lensing objects . observed high optical depth may be explained by the presence of the bar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) there is substantial evidence that the galaxy has a bar at its center ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the parameters of the bar , e.g. , its mass , size , and the motion of stars within it , still remain poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite used the red clump giants ( rcgs ) to constrain the axial ratios and orientation of the galactic bar .",
    "these stars are the equivalent of the horizontal branch stars for a metal - rich population , i.e. , relatively low - mass core helium burning stars .",
    "rcgs in the gb occupy a distinct region in the colour magnitude diagram ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the intrinsic width of the luminosity distribution of rcgs in the gb is small , about 0.2 mag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . their observed peak and width of the luminosity function are related to the distance and radial depth of the bar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that there should be a difference in average proper motions of 1.6 masyr@xmath7 between the bright and faint rcg sub - samples , which are on average on the near and the far side of the bar , respectively , if their tangential streaming motion is 100 kms@xmath7 . following this suggestion , @xcite measured mean proper motion of bright and faint rcgs in one ogle - ii field in baade s window , and they found a difference to be @xmath9 masyr@xmath7 .    to expand this analysis we measured proper motions in all 49 gb fields observed by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ii ( ogle - ii ; @xcite ) for stars down to @xmath10 mag , which is sufficiently deep to include rcgs .",
    "there are several earlier proper motion catalogues of this general area ( c.f .",
    "usno - b:@xcite , improved nltt:@xcite and tycho-2:@xcite ) .",
    "though the area covered by our catalogue is relatively small , it reaches deeper and covers a wide range of proper motion ( @xmath11 masyr@xmath7 ) with the accuracy as good as ( @xmath12 1 masyr@xmath7 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data .",
    "we present the analysis method in  [ sec : analysis ] and [ sec : hpm ] . in  [ sec : catalog ] , [ sec : zeropoint ] and [ sec : problem ] we describe the property , zero point and problems in our catalogue .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we use the data collected during the second phase of the ogle experiment , between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "all observations were made with the 1.3-m warsaw telescope located at the las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the `` first generation '' camera has a site 2048 @xmath13 2048 pixel ccd detector with pixel size of 24 @xmath0 m resulting in 0.417 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "images of the gb fields were taken in drift - scan mode at `` medium '' readout speed with the gain 7.1 @xmath14/adu and readout noise of 6.3 @xmath14 .",
    "a single 2048 @xmath13 8192 pixel frame covers an area of 0.24 @xmath13 0.95 deg@xmath15 .",
    "saturation level is about 55,000 adu .",
    "details of the instrumentation setup can be seen in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use 138 - 555 @xmath4-band frames of the bul_sc1 - 49 fields .",
    "the centers of these fields are listed in table [ tbl : fields ] .",
    "the time baseline is almost 4 years .",
    "there are gaps between the observing seasons when the gb can not be observed from the earth , each about 3 months long .",
    "the median seeing is @xmath16 .",
    "we use the @xmath17 photometric maps of the standard ogle template ( @xcite ) as the astrometric and photometric references .    only about 70% of the area of the bul_sc1 field overlaps with the extinction map made by @xcite .",
    "the extinction map covering all ogle - ii fields has been constructed by @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to check our measurements we cross - identified stars in our catalogue with the tycho-2 catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "we selected from our catalogue objects with proper motions higher than 10 masyr@xmath7 and measured with a significance above 3@xmath18 , to avoid mis - identification .",
    "most high proper motion stars in tycho-2 are saturated in ogle images .",

    "dashed lines indicate @xmath21 , and solid lines represent best fit with fixed unit slope and a possible offset .",
    "a good correspondence between tycho-2 and ogle - ii proper motions gives us certain confidence in our measurements .",
    "slightly larger offsets in @xmath20 imply that the error in absolute proper motion is at a level of 1 masyr@xmath7 , which can be improved by using qsos in the near future .",
    "we also compared the measurements in bul_sc1 made by @xcite ( hereafter sc1@xmath22 ) with the proper motions presented in this paper , for which our measurements are above the @xmath23 level of accuracy .",
    "the two sets of proper motions for 1368 cross - identified stars are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossref_sc1old-1 ] together with the best fit line .",

    "large reduced chi square in @xmath24 are because @xcite did nt correct systematic distortions ( see  [ sec : analysis ] ) , though their systematic distortions have been reduced at a level of 2 masyr@xmath7 by dividing images into small chunks .",
    "we compared the measurements done by us in one of the overlap regions : between fields bul_sc1 and bul_sc45 .",

    "there can be various problems associated with proper motions of variable stars .",
    "our fields are very crowded , hence many stars may be blended . in the case of blending",
    "we measure an average position of a blend of several stars within a seeing disk . if a variable star is blended with other stars which have slightly different positions within a seeing disk , the average position of the blended image may change while one component of the blend varies .",
    "this change might mimic a proper motion .    as an example we present the time variation of the position of a very long timescale microlensing event candidate ( @xcite ) in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pmmicrolensing ] .",
    "the @xmath4-band light curve of this event is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pmmicrolensing ] ( id=2859 in variable star catalogue of @xcite ) . in the top panel",
    "we can see an apparent proper motion in the first year which is coincident with the apparent brightness fading , as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "after the second year the proper motion seems to be small , and the position data points are sparse , which coincides with the low brightness of the star and may reflect the presence of a blend  in poor seeing dophot can not resolve the two stars , hence there are very few data points in the upper panel .",
    "the blend was actually found in the higher resolution ogle - iii images in 2002 .",
    "a plausible interpretation is that the microlensed star was brighter than the nearby faint ` companion ' star in 1997 , but by 2000 it became the fainter of the two .",
    "the position of the ` companion ' is consistent with the direction of the apparent proper motion .",
    "the faint stars seem to have low proper motion .",
    "high resolution observations are needed to fully understand this object .",
    "as another example we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmvariable ] the time variation of the position of a star id=309705 in the ogle - ii field bul_sc39 .",
    "filled circles represent measured positions with type=1 ( used in this work ) , which were at a fixed location for the first three years but moved significantly in the fourth season .",
    "the star id=309705 identified these centroids at the edge of the search radius ( y=-1 ) for the first 3 seasons and at the center ( y=0 ) in the 4th season . on the other hand ,",
    "the neighboring star id=309653 which has a similar brightness of @xmath32 and position of 0.18 pixels east ( positive x ) and -1.89 pixels south ( negative y ) , identified the same centroids at the edge of the search radius ( y=-1 ) .    to see the details of this object , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmvariable ] we also plot the position measurements which are categorized as a star blended with other stars ( type=3 , which are not used in this work ) by dophot for this star ( crosses ) and for a neighboring star id=309653 ( dots ) , which are shifted by + 0.18 pixels in x and -1.89 pixels in y , i.e. these dots are as they are on the ccd , relative to id=309705 .",
    "we can see that these positions ( crosses and dots ) are identified around y=0 ( id=309705 ) and -2 ( id=309653 ) , respectively , with filled circles in - between them .",
    "we also show the @xmath4-band light curves of id=309705 ( middle panel ) and id=309653 ( bottom panel ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmvariable ] .",
    "we can see id=309705 is constant during four seasons but id=309653 suddenly faded during the 4th season .",
    "this is likely to be a r crb type variable .",
    "the simplest interpretation is as follows ; small number of data points in the seasons 1997 - 99 indicates that dophot found that object which is composite of these two stars only on the bad seeing frames as a single star with type=1 , in other cases they are separated but categorized as blended - type=3 . in 2000 when the star id=309653 faded , the centroid of the composite moved and finally the star id=309705 became a `` single '' star with type=1 .",
    "so the number of data points is large in 2000 .",
    "proper motions of variable stars may have their errors increased not only because of variable contribution of blending , but also because variable stars may change colours , and therefore the coefficient of differential refraction may also change . in rare cases of very long period variables this may be noticeable .",
    "note : we do not treat this kind of objects in a special way , so a reader must be careful when using our catalogue in studies of variable stars .",
    "the effect of blending changes with seeing may contribute to the scatter of data points , but it is not likely to have a seasonal effect .",
    "hence , we think that seeing variations are not a major problem .",
    "the probability of blending is much larger for fainter stars , in particular those close to @xmath33 mag .",
    "this may produce a bias in their proper motions , most likely reducing their formal proper motion , as the blended stars may have a different proper motion vector , so the average value is likely to be reduced .",
    "we also do not provide a special treatment for this kind of objects , so a reader must be careful when using our catalogue for faint stars .",
    "we have measured proper motions for 5,080,236 stars in all 49 ogle - ii gb fields , covering a range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our catalogue contains objects with proper motions up to @xmath34 masyr@xmath7 and @xmath4-band magnitudes in the range @xmath35 .",
    "the accuracy of proper motions in our catalogue is better than 1 masyr@xmath7 for @xmath36 .",
    "one should keep in mind that all measurements of @xmath0 presented here are not absolute , but relative to the astrometric reference frame which is roughly that of the galactic center ( gc ) with a small offset seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : muvsx ] .",
    "however , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : zeropoint ] , by using the crude estimation for the proper motion of the gc in our reference frame and formula equations ( [ eq : pma_inertial ] ) and ( [ eq : pmd_inertial ] ) , we can obtain crude proper motions in an inertial frame . from the comparison with these inertial values and the tycho2 catalogue",
    ", this transformation seems to work well with errors at a level of 1 masyr@xmath7 . from comparison of @xmath0 measured in the overlap region of fields bul_sc1 and bul_sc45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crossref_sc1 - 45 ] ) , this transformation works very well in the relative offset from field to field .",
    "these zero points for proper motions can be improved by using background quasars which may be detected in the near future using the ogle - ii variability catalogue ( @xcite ) .    as demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "the proper motions based on ogle - ii data can be used to clearly detect the presence of a strong streaming motion ( rotation ) of stars in the galactic bar .",
    "while the reference frame established from all stars is not well defined with respect to the inertial frame , the relative motions of groups of stars within a given field are well determined .",
    "though our primary goal is to constrain the galactic bar model with the future analysis of our catalogue , we provide proper motions for all stars with @xmath37 mag in all 49 ogle - ii gb fields because this catalogue might be useful for a variety of projects .",
