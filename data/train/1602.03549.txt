    "the consequences of the renormalization group theory ( rgt ) approach have been studied in exquisite detail in numerous regular physical models , typified by the canonical near neighbor interaction ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "it has been tacitly assumed that edwards - anderson ising spin glasses ( isgs ) , where the interactions are random , follow the same basic scaling and universality rules as the regular models .",
    "the binder cumulant  @xcite is an important observable which has been almost exclusively exploited numerically for its scaling properties as a dimensionless observable very close to criticality in the finite - size scaling ( fss ) regime @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the sample size and @xmath2 the second - moment correlation length at inverse temperature @xmath3 .",
    "here we will consider its scaling properties in the thermodynamic limit ( thl ) regime @xmath4 where the properties of a finite - size sample if normalized correctly are independent of @xmath1 and so are the same as those of the infinite - size model .",
    "( a standard rule of thumb for the onset of the thl regime is @xmath5 ) .    in ising ferromagnets , the second field derivative of the susceptibility @xmath6 in a hypercubic lattice",
    "is directly related to the binder cumulant , see eq .",

    "@xcite , through @xmath7    the susceptibility @xmath8 scales with the critical exponent @xmath9 , and the critical exponent for the second field derivative of the susceptibility @xmath6 ( also called the non - linear susceptibility ) , is  @xcite @xmath10 because of very basic rgt scaling and hyperscaling  @xcite relationships between exponents . @xmath11 and @xmath9 are the standard critical exponents for the correlation length and the susceptibility ; a textbook definition of hyperscaling is : `` identities obtained from the generalised homogeneity assumption involve the space dimension @xmath12 , and are known as hyperscaling relations . ''",
    "@xcite . explicitly quoting ref .",
    "@xcite : `` below the upper critical dimension , the following hyperscaling relations are supposed to be valid : @xmath13 , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gap exponent , which controls the radius of the disk in the complex - temperature plane without zeroes , i.e. the gap , of the partition function ( yang - lee theorem ) '' .",
    "thus in the thl regime the normalized binder cumulant @xmath16 ( or alternatively @xmath17 ) scales with the critical exponent @xmath18 , together with correction terms as for any such observable .    for high temperatures",
    ", it can be noted that in any @xmath19 ising system the infinite - temperature ( i.e. independent spins ) limit for the binder cumulant is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of spins ; @xmath22 for a hypercubic lattice so at infinite temperature @xmath23 .",
    "hyperscaling is well established in standard models , such as the ising models in dimensions less than the upper critical dimension , but many years ago hyperscaling relations were predicted to break down in quenched random systems  @xcite .",
    "two hyperscaling relations have been quoted above ; the first is well known and concerns the specific heat exponent @xmath24 .",
    "the breakdown of this hyperscaling relation in the random field ising model has been extensively studied @xcite . in the ising spin glasses which we discuss below @xmath24",
    "is strongly negative and so is very hard to measure directly ; we will be concerned only with the second hyperscaling relation which is less well known .",
    "we are aware of no tests of this hyperscaling relation in a system with quenched randomness such as a spin glass .",
    "first we outline the general scaling approach , which follows ref .",
    "the wegner scaling expression @xcite for an observable @xmath25 in the thl regime is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a temperature scaling variable which tends to zero at criticality @xmath28 ; @xmath25 diverges with the critical exponent @xmath29 . in order to cover the entire paramagnetic temperature range , the conventional rgt scaling variable @xmath30 can not be used as the temperature scaling variable because it diverges at infinite temperature . following wegner and high temperature scaling expansion ( htse ) studies",
    "@xcite it is appropriate to use for ising models the alternative temperature variable @xmath31 , which tends to @xmath32 at infinite temperature . for ising spin glasses ( isgs ) having an interaction distribution with symmetry between positive and negative interactions ,",
    "an appropriate scaling variable is @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to normalise all observables @xmath25 in such a way that the infinite temperature limit is @xmath32 , not @xmath34 or @xmath35 , as otherwise a diverging set of correction terms would be required .",
    "the observables @xmath36 and @xmath37 automatically obey this condition .",
    "the second moment correlation length @xmath38 fulfills the condition when normalized to @xmath39 in ising models and to @xmath40 in isgs  @xcite .",
    "as will be seen below , with this approach data can be fitted to high precision over the entire paramagnetic temperature range from criticality to infinity with a minimal set of wegner correction terms ( in principle there is an infinite set of correction terms but with these normalisations the higher order terms become extremely weak ) .",
    "assuming @xmath41 is known or can be estimated precisely , the true critical exponents for the various observables can be estimated quite accurately from thl data without the need to approach @xmath41 closely .",
    "we will first study two canonical ising models : the square lattice model in dimension @xmath42 and the simple cubic model in dimension @xmath43 , in order to validate our method for testing hyperscaling .",
    "we will choose as the thermal scaling variable in the ising models @xmath44 .",

    "@xcite , eq .",
    ". we will follow the `` extended scaling '' convention introduced above and take the normalized correlation length , @xmath47 .",
    "the thl normalized correlation length behaves as @xmath48 it diverges with the standard critical exponent @xmath11 at criticality , and tends to @xmath32 exactly at infinite temperature @xmath49 for any dimension @xmath12 .",
    "the term in @xmath50 is the leading wegner correction  @xcite . with the approach we follow , as thl correlation length corrections are relativly small for these ising models in either dimension @xmath42 or dimension @xmath43 @xcite the effective correlation length exponent @xmath51/\\partial\\ln\\tau$ ] is only weakly temperature dependent from criticality to close to infinite temperature .",
    "it is not necessary to go very close to criticality in order to observe an effective exponent @xmath52 very similar in value to the true critical value .",
    "when simulation data for different sizes @xmath1 are displayed together the thl regime can be identified by inspection as the regime where the observable becomes @xmath1 independent . a very detailed analysis of susceptibility",
    ", correlation length and specific heat data for the @xmath43d ising model following the present approach is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now consider the binder cumulant in the ising models . from the relations above",
    ", the normalized thl binder cumulant @xmath53 has an infinite - temperature limit which is strictly @xmath32 , and a thl regime behavior with a critical exponent @xmath54 if hyperscaling holds , together with wegner corrections as for other observables , so : @xmath55 once again if the correction terms are relatively weak an approximately assymptotic behavior , with an effective exponent very similar to @xmath54 , will set in well before true criticality .",
    "there is a hyperuniversal combination of critical amplitudes , the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant @xcite , which with the present conventions then can be written as @xmath56 .",
    "so , in an ising model if we plot the logarithm of the normalized binder cumulant @xmath57 $ ] and the logarithm of the normalized correlation length @xmath58 $ ] against @xmath59 , the thl negative slopes @xmath60 will tend to @xmath54 and @xmath11 respectively as criticality is approached ; for all @xmath1 the data will tend to @xmath61 at the infinite temperature @xmath49 limit .    for the ising model ferromagnets on the @xmath42d square lattice and the @xmath43d simple cubic lattice ,",
