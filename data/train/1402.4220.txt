    "functional models from analytic functions were developed by sz.nagy-foias @xcite and used for classifying contractive operators on hilbert spaces .",
    "a similar approach was used by popescu in @xcite for classifying row contractions by certain multi - analytic operators .",
    "these classifying objects were called characteristic functions . in @xcite and",
    "more explicitly in @xcite characteristic functions of liftings of row contractions were introduced and it was shown that they are complete invariants for unitary equivalence in a certain class of liftings . here",
    "we present an approach which is based on a systematic use of associated functional models which on the one hand exhibits popescu s characteristic functions as special cases of characteristic functions of liftings and which on the other hand fully discloses the additional potentials of our generalization .",

    "here @xmath19 denotes the standard basis vector of @xmath20 .",
    "we call @xmath15 _ contractive _ if @xmath21 .",
    "note that for @xmath22 and @xmath23 a contractive multi - analytic operator corresponds exactly to multiplication with a function in the schur class , i.e. , a bounded analytic function in the open unit disk with supremum norm at most @xmath0 .",
    "\\(2 ) a @xmath24-tuple @xmath25 of operators on a hilbert space @xmath26 is called a _ row contraction _ if it is a contraction from @xmath27 to @xmath26 or , equivalently , if @xmath28 .",
    "if a @xmath24-tuple @xmath29 on a hilbert space @xmath30 can be written in the form @xmath31 for suitable @xmath24-tuples @xmath32 and @xmath33 then @xmath34 is called a _ lifting _ of @xmath35 .",
    "the lifting is called _ contractive _ if @xmath34 is still a row contraction and it is called _ minimal _ if @xmath36 is the smallest @xmath34-invariant subspace containing @xmath26 .",
    "( by @xmath34-invariance we mean invariance for all @xmath37 . )",
    "we remark that it presents no particular difficulties to include sequences of operators ( @xmath38 ) but we write all formulas as if @xmath24 is finite .    to establish a correspondence between the two main players we start with a detailed discussion of functional models .",
    "we use the generalized setting introduced by popescu in @xcite to study row contractions .",
    "the case @xmath22 ( single contractions ) is of course of special interest and our results are new also for @xmath22 but these results work just as well for general @xmath24 .",
    "this observation is important because from the case @xmath39 there are promising applications to the dynamics of open quantum systems , see @xcite for an introduction to this topic and further references along these lines .",
    "the impact of our results on these applications will be worked out elsewhere .    in section 2",
    "we prove properties of functional models to be used later .",
    "the results about functional models which are new depend on observations about the geometry of an invariant subspace for a row isometry which we derive from a geometric lemma proved in an appendix to this paper .",
    "they establish relations between the positions of certain subspaces on the one hand and properties of the symbol @xmath40 of the multi - analytic operator on the other hand .",
    "section 3 is the core of the paper .",
    "based on the results about the functional model and extending ideas from @xcite , we work out a mapping @xmath41 which , for any given row contraction @xmath35 , maps contractive multi - analytic operators @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the defect space of @xmath35 , to contractive liftings @xmath34 of @xmath35 . in the converse direction",
    "we make use of the theory of the minimal isometric dilation for the contractive lifting @xmath34 to construct a mapping @xmath44 from contractive liftings @xmath34 of a given row contraction @xmath35 to contractive multi - analytic operators @xmath42 .",
    "suitably restricted , the maps @xmath41 and @xmath44 become inverses of each other and we obtain a one - to - one correspondence between unitary equivalence classes of minimal contractive liftings and equivalence classes of injective symbols .",
    "this justifies to call the corresponding multi - analytic operators characteristic functions of liftings , as has been done already in @xcite . with the theory developed here we provide a complete answer to the open problem posed at the end of section 3 in @xcite , namely to classify the multi - analytic operators which can occur as characteristic functions of liftings .",
    "the surprisingly simple answer , all that is needed is the easily checked property of injectivity of the symbol , shows that the connection with liftings is a very natural application of multi - analytic operators and makes it now much easier to develop the applications",
    ". we can always study minimal contractive liftings via the corresponding symbols .",
    "as an example of such an application we study the factorization of liftings with the help of the corresponding factorization of the characteristic functions ( compare @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in section 4 we revisit popescu s work in @xcite where he defined a characteristic function for a completely non - coisometric row contraction as a certain multi - analytic operator .",
    "we show that this can be considered as a special case of our theory in the sense that popescu s characteristic functions appear as characteristic functions of a special type of liftings and that the property of being a complete invariant for unitary equivalence follows from the corresponding result about liftings in section 3 .    in section 5",
    "we look at a class of examples : minimal contractive liftings @xmath45 of a single contraction @xmath46 such that both @xmath46 and @xmath45 have defect equal to @xmath0 . by our theory",
    "the unitary equivalence classes of these liftings are in one - to - one correspondence with non - zero schur functions on the unit disk ( up to unimodular complex factors ) .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to illustrate many of the previous results by easily computable examples .",
    "already in this case in the future there is a lot more to find out about these liftings by making a more systematic use of what is known about schur functions .",
    "for example , operator - valued schur functions have been used for commutant lifting , see @xcite and more recently @xcite .",
    "related work in different directions is done in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but the explicit parametrization of all minimal contractive liftings achieved here is new and provides an excellent basis for studying applications , for example the dynamics of open quantum systems mentioned earlier .",
    "in fact in the special case of the minimal isometric dilation it is long known and well studied how it describes the embedding of open into closed quantum systems , see for example @xcite .",
    "let us finish this introduction with a short reminder of the well known theory of the _ minimal isometric dilation _",
    "@xmath47 of a row contraction @xmath48 which appears in several places in this paper .",
    "it was first presented in @xcite , with small modifications we use the notation from @xcite . in both papers a lot of additional details can be found .",
    "recall that a @xmath24-tuple @xmath49 on a hilbert space @xmath50 is called a _ row isometry _ if @xmath51 or , equivalently , the @xmath52 are isometries with orthogonal ranges .",

    ". a row isometry @xmath66 with this property is called an isometric dilation of @xmath67 .",
    "it is easily seen that this is actually a very specific example of a contractive lifting in the sense introduced earlier .",
    "if we require minimality for an isometric dilation in the sense that the bigger hilbert space is the smallest closed @xmath66-invariant space containing @xmath53 then this determines @xmath66 up to unitary equivalence and we denote it by @xmath47 , on the hilbert space @xmath68 .",
    "there is a construction of the minimal isometric dilation analogous to the schffer construction for a single contraction : recall that the operator @xmath69 given by @xmath70 is called the _ defect operator _ , @xmath71 is called the _ defect space _ and the ( hilbert space ) dimension of @xmath72 is called the _ defect _ of @xmath67 .",

    "we refer to the row contraction @xmath75 as the _ canonical row shift _ and to @xmath77 as its _ generating wandering subspace_.

    "it can be extended to a canonical unitary from @xmath81 onto @xmath82 ( over all words @xmath56 , including the empty word @xmath64 ) intertwining the two versions of the minimal isometric dilation .",

    "note that by this construction we can think of @xmath15 as the orthogonal projection onto @xmath89 restricted to @xmath90 .",
    "further define the @xmath24-tuple @xmath49 on the hilbert space @xmath91 by @xmath92 it is easy to see that @xmath66 is a row isometry on @xmath93 .",

    "* @xmath15 satisfies the szeg condition ( see definition [ sz ] ) if and only if ( the spectral representation of ) @xmath40 satisfies the _ spectral szeg condition _ : @xmath464 * a schur function @xmath40 is the characteristic function of a completely non - coisometric contraction if and only if it satisfies @xmath463 and the spectral szeg condition .",
    "\\(a ) is obvious because @xmath465 is equal to the zeroth taylor coefficient of @xmath40 .",
    "with the considerations preceding this proposition we see that the szeg condition ( from definition [ sz ] ) holds if and only if the constant polynomial @xmath0 can be approximated in norm by analytic polynomials @xmath466 with @xmath467 in the hilbert space @xmath468 . here",
    "the non - negative function @xmath469 plays the role of a density for lebesgue measure . by a classical theorem of szeg",
    "this is the case if and only if the spectral szeg condition holds , see @xcite , chapter 4 .",
    "this proves ( b ) .",
    "now ( c ) is just the reformulation of theorem [ cnc ] in the setting of schur functions .",
    "it is a classical result that a schur function @xmath40 satisfies what we have called the spectral szeg condition if and only if it is an extremal schur function , see @xcite , chapter 9 .",
    "generalizations of this result for the case of operator - valued schur functions ( still with @xmath22 ) are given in @xcite , generalizations for @xmath39 are discussed in @xcite , section 1.4 , in connection with the notion of prediction entropy .",
    "note at this point that any non - zero schur function is the characteristic function of a lifting but only a very special subclass consists of characteristic functions of completely non - coisometric contractions .",
    "we give an example outside of this special subclass .",
    "again we start with the contraction @xmath433 on a one - dimensional hilbert space @xmath26 but this time we look at the schur function @xmath470 .",
    "clearly this does not satisfy the spectral szeg condition .",
    "again we want to construct the minimal contractive lifting @xmath471 .    in this case",
    "the model space is @xmath472 .",

    "further @xmath478 if and only if @xmath479 which is satisfied if and only if @xmath480 .",
    "so we have @xmath481 here @xmath482 for @xmath483 ( note that @xmath484 applied to a constant function yields zero ) and for @xmath485 we find @xmath486 the last equality can be checked by verifying that the difference @xmath487 is indeed orthogonal to @xmath163 .",
    "we note that any factorization @xmath488 among non - zero schur functions leads to a corresponding factorization of liftings , by theorem [ factor ] .",
    "in particular the lifting in the previous example can be factorized in many ways .",
    "but we postpone a detailed investigation of this phenomenon to another place .",
    "we finally remark that the general case of minimal contractive liftings for a single contraction ( the general case @xmath22 ) can be handled in a similar way .",
    "in fact , for @xmath22 a multi - analytic operator has a spectral representation by an operator - valued schur function , i.e. , a bounded analytic function @xmath40 on the open unit disk such that @xmath489 and @xmath490 for all @xmath182 in the open unit disk",
    ". then theorem [ char ] takes the form that there is a one - to - one correspondence between unitary equivalence classes of minimal contractive liftings @xmath45 with defect @xmath349 ( of a given contraction @xmath46 ) and operator - valued schur functions with values in @xmath491 , up to a unitary on @xmath10 ( the same for all @xmath182 ) , and with the following injectivity property : if @xmath372 then @xmath492 is not the zero function .",
    "in our analysis of functional models in section 2 we need a few technical results about how the kernel of the adjoint changes if we go to a restriction of an operator .",
    "we provide them in the following lemma .",
    "these are quite general observations , useful in particular to describe the geometry of invariant subspaces .",
