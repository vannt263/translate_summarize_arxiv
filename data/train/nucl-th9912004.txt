    "in the previous paper @xcite , referred here as i , the contribution of the core nucleons to the anapole moment ( am ) , arising from the core polarization effects , has been calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "recently , the first measurement of the am of cesium has been reported @xcite .",
    "the immediate application of this measurement was the attempt to deduce the pion - nucleon weak parity - non - conserving ( pnc ) coupling constant @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the measured anapole moment value with the one calculated using a pure single - particle model leads to a value for @xmath0 that exceeds by a factor 4 the value deduced from a parity violating measurement in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated comparison was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the results from @xmath1 , the am of @xmath2 , and the upper bound for the am of @xmath3 @xcite were used to deduce both @xmath0 and @xmath4 pnc coupling constants .",
    "the combination of the coupling constants was found which satisfies both @xmath1 and @xmath5 experiments and which is barely in agreement with theory .",
    "these values , however , are inconsistent with the constraint obtained from @xmath3 measurement .",
    "this situation , even independently on @xmath1 experiments , raises the question how accurate is the theory of nuclear anapole moments .",
    "here we address this question and present more accurate calculation of the many - body effects .",
    "there are different contributions to the value of nuclear am .",
    "the most significant and the least model dependent contribution comes from the valence nucleon .",
    "it is stable under variations of the single - particle potential @xcite . within the single - particle model",
    "it is often convenient to use the leading approximation ( la ) @xcite producing the simple analytical expression for the correction to the single - particle wave function @xmath6 due to the pnc potential .",
    "the la was used in i in calculations of the core nucleons contribution to the anapole moment .",
    "this is another contribution which is not negligible .",
    "the accuracy of the la was estimated to be within 20% in @xcite .",
    "we found , that although this is true for the upper level of the spin - orbit doublet , for the lower level the difference between la and the exact correction @xmath6 can be significant .",
    "this demands improving the calculation of the core nucleons contribution .",
    "another phenomenon that has to be accounted for is the pairing .",
    "the reason for this is that for @xmath5 nucleus there are single - particle states very close to the fermi surface .",
    "the transitions to these states produce large contribution to the core polarization . in the presence of pairing these transitions",
    "will be strongly reduced , thus affecting the value of the polarization effects and the nuclear anapole moment .",
    "finally , we discuss the constants of the short range effective pnc interaction used in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "these constants were obtained from the finite range meson exchange forces by comparing typical matrix elements both finite range and short range interactions @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 were found for @xmath9- and @xmath10-exchange forces .",
    "these values , however , were obtained for @xmath11-particle and the extension to heavier nuclei should be checked separately .",
    "we found using the same procedure that the factor @xmath12 is state dependent and it is different for @xmath5 and @xmath3 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the accuracy of the la .",
    "then , we present the exact calculations of the core polarization contribution and demonstrate the necessity to include the pairing . finally , we discuss the constants of the short range pnc interaction .",
    "for completeness of the discussion let us to remind the basic equations from i. there are several contributions to the am arising from different parts of the electromagnetic current .",
    "apart from magnetization current which gives the main contribution , there are contributions from the convection current , the spin - orbit current and the contact current arising from the momentum dependence of the corresponding parts of the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is anticommutator , @xmath15 is the proton mean squared radius , @xmath16 is the central nuclear density , @xmath17 - nuclear density profile , and @xmath18 is the proton - neutron constant of the effective spin - orbit residual interaction @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is the weak interaction fermi coupling constant , @xmath20 is the proton mass , and @xmath21 is the nucleon magnetic moment .",
    "the contact current contribution arises from the velocity dependence of the effective nucleon - nucleon pnc forces @xcite    the operators in eq .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) differ from the one used in i and @xcite . here",

    "the last term in eq.([e3 ] ) , see fig.1 ( ii c ) , is responsible for the renormalization of these contributions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the correction @xmath44 has the parity opposite to @xmath45 .",
    "the change in parity happens because @xmath44 is created from @xmath45 by the interaction that does not conserve parity . while am is e1 type operator ,",
    "the correction @xmath44 is m1 type .",

    "the single - particle value is small compared to the magnetization current contribution .",
    "let us note that it differs from the corresponding value cited in i. the difference , although small , comes from the center of - mass - motion that was not excluded in i. it is interesting to note that for the convection current , the polarization contribution has the same sign as the single - particle one .",
    "this is in contrast to the spin case where the polarization contribution has always the opposite sign compared to the single - particle value .",
    "the difference between these two cases lies in the polarization loop which is non - diagonal for the convection current case .",
    "it has the spin operator in one vertex and the convection part of the am ( see eq.([e1 ] ) ) in the other . for such non - diagonal loop",
    "the sign is not fixed .",

    "the summed value @xmath142 has decreased by 50% , as compared to its single - particle value .",
    "thus , the effect of the core polarization is considerable .",
    "in general , the pairing effects are important only for the transitions near the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , they can be neglected in calculations of @xmath6 and in the polarization loop in eq.([e18 ] ) where the transitions to at least next shell are involved .",
    "the situation is different for eq.([e19 ] ) where the transitions within the open shell are allowed .",
    "good example is @xmath5 where the polarization loop includes the transitions between the states with the excitation energy about one hundred kev .",
    "transitions to such close levels contribute significantly into polarization loop creating large response in @xmath44 .",
    "these transitions will apparently be suppressed by pairing correlations .",
    "for these reason the polarization loop in eq.([e19 ] ) should be modified in order to include pairing .",
    "the modification is straightforward and can be done similarly to @xcite .",
    "the particle - hole propagator for a t - odd channel in the presence of pairing has the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the bogolyubov factors , and @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the pairing gap and the chemical potential .",
    "below , we shall neglect slight state dependence of the pairing gap and put @xmath149 .",
    "let us divide the single - particle space into 3 regions .",
    "let @xmath150 be a projection operator onto the region near the fermi surface , where pairing produces a significant effect .",
    "it is convenient to include here all bound states above the fermi surface .",
    "let @xmath151 be a projection operator onto the hole states below the pairing region .",
    "in this region we neglect the pairing effects .",
    "the states in continuum will be projected by @xmath152 .",
    "introducing the identity @xmath153 into eq.([e25 ] ) we obtain the expression for the particle - hole loop as a sum of 7 following terms @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 in eq.([e26 ] ) we put @xmath158 in all terms containing @xmath151 .",

    "the normalization factors @xmath12 and @xmath187 were determined by comparing matrix elements of the interaction eq.([e4 ] ) and the finite - range ddh interaction of ref.@xcite for @xmath196 scattering at low energy .",
    "therefore , we hardly can expect them to be constant in a broad range of all bound single - particle states . in order to check the accuracy of this procedure we calculated @xmath12 as a ratio of typical matrix elements of the finite range ddh @xcite interaction and the zero range interaction eq.([e4 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.7 where the normalization factor @xmath12 is plotted as a function of a single - particle energy for the proton and neutron states .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is really state dependent . only near fermi surface @xmath197 . for the states with lower energy",
    "it becomes larger reaching the value @xmath198 for @xmath199 states .     as a function of bound state energy .",
    "proton states are connected by dashes .",
    "neutron states are connected by dots.,width=377 ]    for this reason one should not use such a simple relation as eq.([e27 ] ) for determination of the pnc meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "there is an additional reason why eq.([e27 ] ) should not be used to extract the interaction constants .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite strong renormalization of the pnc nucleon - nucleon interaction can exist in nuclear media . as a result ,",
    "the neutron pnc potential constant @xmath200 ( which is small when estimated using eq.([e27 ] ) ) can be comparable to the proton constant @xmath171 .",
    "( see also discussion of the subject in ref.@xcite . ) from this point of view , the measurements sensitive to @xmath200 would be extremely interesting",
    ". these could be the measurements of the anapole moment of a nucleus with an odd neutron or , another possibility , the measurement of the neutron spin rotation in helium @xcite .    in order to obtain the measured value of the am of @xmath5 the pnc interaction constants eq.([e5 ] ) should be increased approximately by a factor of 2 as compared to their eq.([e27 ] ) `` best values '' .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar conclusion has been obtained from statistical analysis of the pnc effects in compound nuclei @xcite .    in table 3",
    "we show the summarized results for a set of the proton odd and the neutron odd nuclei . here",
    "we list just the sum of all contributions . for ba isotopes the calculations",
    "were performed including the pairing .",
    "it is worth noting that for nuclei with an odd neutron due to the core polarization some contribution proportional to the proton coupling @xmath171 appears in the anapole moment . in case of small @xmath200",
    "it can be of the same order as the direct @xmath200 contribution .",
