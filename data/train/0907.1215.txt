    "in the context of current efforts to build quantum networks @xcite , a promising way to transfer quantum states reliably in the network is through the coupling of single photons and atoms in the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . for practical applications ,",
    "the coupling between a single atom located in an optical cavity and a single intercavity photon should be strong .",
    "the strong coupling condition requires that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the one - photon rabi frequency , @xmath3 is the atomic decay rate to modes other than the cavity mode , and @xmath4 is the decay rate of the cavity mode itself . this may be achieved using high - finesse optical cavities , with an extreme reduction in the cavity volume , and using atomic transitions with a large dipole moment .    using the cavity qed techniques , schemes for a number of operations of direct relevance to quantum information processing",
    "have been proposed , one of them being generation of single photons ` on demand ' . through strong coupling of a mode of the cavity field to an atomic transition , which is resonantly driven by the input single - photon pulse , an external control field of rabi frequency @xmath5 transfers one photon in the cavity mode to a long - lived atomic memory , which can then be released at",
    "will to free space through the cavity output mirror , leading to an output single - photon pulse as a collimated beam .",
    "the temporal structure ( both amplitude and phase ) of the resultant ` flying photon ' can be tailored by way of the control field @xmath5 @xcite , with the spatial structure of the wave - packet being set by the cavity mode .",
    "the basic scheme ( see figure 1 ) involves a three - level atom in a @xmath0-configuration with an excited state @xmath6 and two lower states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an optical cavity mode is strongly and coherently coupled to the atom on the @xmath9 transition with rate @xmath2 , and a strong classical field @xmath5 drives the @xmath10 transition . denoting by @xmath11 a state in which the atom is in state @xmath12 and there are @xmath13 photons in the cavity mode , reversible transfer of a state between light and a single trapped atom",
    "can be achieved through the mappings @xmath14 for the coherent absorption and emission of single photons by a procedure involving the ` dark state ' .",
    "the atom - cavity system coupled to a classical control field @xmath5 has an instantaneous eigenstate @xmath15 , given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( [ eq1 ] ) is called the ` dark state ' @xcite as it does not have any component involving the excited level @xmath6 , which can radiate .",
    "if initially the system is prepared in the state @xmath18 with @xmath19 , then a sufficiently slow increase of @xmath20 to @xmath21 leads the state to move adiabatically to @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , if initially the system is in state @xmath22 with @xmath23 , then decreasing @xmath5 adiabatically to zero leads the system to the state @xmath18 .",
    "the advantages of the dark state protocol are : ( a ) it minimizes the dissipative effects generic to two - level systems , and ( b ) it is reversible , i.e. , a photon that is emitted from a system a is efficiently transferred to another system b by applying the time - reversed ( and suitably delayed ) control field @xmath5 to system b. cirac _",
    "@xcite proposed a quantum network with nodes consisting of cavities each containing a three - level atom .",
    "the entanglement between atom - cavity states at each node is generated using the protocol described above .",
    "similar protocols involving adiabatic transfers using three - level atoms , either trapped in or passing through electromagnetic cavities , have also been proposed for other purposes .",
    "_ @xcite were the first to propose this kind of protocol to generate fock states and other nonclassical states of the cavity mode .",
    "@xcite proposed implementation of a two - bit quantum gate by putting two three - level atoms inside the cavity .",
    "the first experimental attempt of such a reversible mapping of a field to and from an atomic state has been made @xcite by using a single trapped cesium atom . in this example ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath7 represent internal states of the atom with long - lived coherence , namely , the hyperfine states in the 6s@xmath24 , f = 3 and f = 4 manifolds of atomic cs , and @xmath6 corresponds to 6p@xmath25 , f = 3 .",
    "intrinsically reversible and controlled single - photon sources have been demonstrated @xcite using the dark state based on stimulated raman adiabatic passage between two ground states of a single atom strongly coupled to a single mode of a high - finesse optical cavity . the above kind of adiabatic transfer has also been used with _ ensembles _ of three - level atoms in a pencil geometry , which lead to the well known phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and slow light @xcite . with atomic ensembles , the light pulses can be stored as collective atomic polaritons and recovered with high fidelity again by manipulating a control laser adiabatically @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed long - distance quantum communication and entanglement using nodes of atomic ensembles .",
    "very recently , _",
    "single - atom _ eit condition through a coherent dark state has been achieved in a high - finesse optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the single atom effectively acts as a quantum optical transistor , coherently controlling the transmission of light through the cavity .    though the various procedures outlined above have different physical features , underlying all of them is the assumption of adiabatic transfer through the dark state of a single three - level atom in the @xmath0-configuration .",
    "the adiabatic condition is taken to be fulfilled if the evolution time is significantly longer than the inverse of the frequency gap between the dark state and the other eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "but it is of utmost interest to understand the precise conditions , the fidelity and the experimental limitations of this procedure which allows transfer of quantum state information from the photon to an atom and vice versa .",
    "this question has received a lot of attention in several physical contexts . in general , the superadiabatic transfer procedure given by berry @xcite allows one to treat the non - adiabatic corrections in the quantum evolution for slow rates of change of the control laser in the absence of dissipation . for cavity - qed with a trapped atom , duan , kuzmich and kimble @xcite",
    "have presented a detailed analysis of schemes which require photon transfer between cavity mode and the mode of the external channel . here",
    "the non - adiabatic analysis requires inclusion of a large number of states , and the analysis has been carried out numerically .",
    "a drawback of this analysis is that the dissipative terms are put in the schrdinger equation for the amplitudes .",
    "this may suppress some important non - adiabatic elements of the quantum transfer process , and the issue needs to be examined , if possible , using a better formalism .",
    "the same problem has also been analyzed by yao _",
    "@xcite , but in their analysis , the coupling to the external channel has been treated in the wigner - weisskopf approximation , which may not hold for all the procedures of interest .",
    "we wish to address here the exact problem of the transfer dynamics in the context of a single atom in an electromagnetic cavity , for arbitrary rates of variation of the control laser and with the inclusion of dissipation in the form of spontaneous emission from the upper level . for a three - level atom in the @xmath0 configuration interacting with a single cavity mode",
    ", one can carry out a thorough non - adiabatic analysis as the hilbert space is small .",
    "as has been seen in @xcite , the effect of spontaneous photons from the excited atomic state on quantum computation is much more destructive than cavity decay .",
    "this is because after a cavity photon emission , the system is still in a dark state , which is not necessarily true for spontaneous emission .",
    "thus the atomic excited states can be populated , which gives rise to further spontaneous photons .",
    "furthermore , we work in the strong - coupling regime where @xmath26 . in this regime",
    "we neglect the decay of the cavity photon .",
    "thus our analysis is not directly applicable to cases where photon transfer to external channel is of comparable time scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first study the problem of an atomic system in a @xmath0 configuration interacting with photons in a cavity mode and a time - dependent control field , ignoring any dissipative effects .",
    "our simple considerations show that the non - adiabatic effects are large when @xmath5 is small .",
    "since during storage as well as retrieval , @xmath5 is made zero , the non - adiabatic effects are unavoidable , and the problem can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "accordingly , we study the problem numerically .    next ,",
    "in section 3 , we analyze the effect of dissipation by allowing for the possibility of spontaneous emission , which is inevitable in any realistic system .",
    "since spontaneous decay sends the system to the lower levels , one might expect that dissipation would mitigate the non - adiabatic effects .",
    "we study the impact of dissipation using a method in which the quantum evolution of the wavefunction is interrupted by spontaneous transitions of the state to the lower levels @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "spontaneous decays are governed by a stochastic poissonian process with a rate which we take to be the width of the level @xmath29 .",
    "though dissipation in quantum systems is naturally incorporated in the density matrix formalism , we believe that the wavefunction treatment is a fair approximation , and it has two distinct advantages . first , the physical picture of the system evolution and the role of dissipation is rather transparent .",
    "second , there is a numerical simplification of having to solve only three coupled time - dependent differential equations .    in section 4",
    ", we present our results on the dynamics of the fidelity of the storage and the retrieval process .",
    "different rates of variation of the control field at different signal strengths are explored , each in the absence and presence of dissipation .",
    "we compare our results in the absence of dissipation to the superadiabatic theory due to berry @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we present our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a , we compare the wavefunction approach with the density matrix approach and point out the nature of the approximation made in our analysis .",
    "we now consider the @xmath0 atomic system as shown in figure 1 , which interacts with the signal photon in the cavity mode and the control laser field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isolated atom - signal field system is @xmath30 , with @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the annihilation operator for the particular cavity mode of frequency @xmath33 , which couples to the transition between levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath34 . in the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the time - dependent interaction hamiltonian of the fields with the atomic system ( in one dimension ) is @xmath35 - \\hbar \\big [ \\omega_c ( t ) e^{-i \\nu t } \\vert a \\rangle \\langle c \\vert \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\omega_c^ * ( t ) e^{i \\nu t } \\vert c \\rangle \\langle a \\vert \\big ] , \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the frequency of the control field , and @xmath2 , the rabi frequency for the cavity photon is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the dipole moment between levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath39 the cavity volume , and @xmath40 the permittivity of vacuum .",
    "it is assumed that only transitions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dipole - allowed .",
    "the control field with a rabi frequency @xmath43 is treated classically .",
    "considering an @xmath13-photon quantum field , the wavefunction of the system of one atom+field can be expressed in general as @xmath44 .",

    "then * x * obeys the equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the rabi frequency of the @xmath13-photon signal field .",
    "we write the solution of the above equation in terms of the instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenvectors : @xmath55 at two - photon resonance , i.e. , with @xmath56 , the instantaneous eigenvalues are @xmath57 where @xmath58 the instantaneous eigenvectors of the atom - field system are @xmath59 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "now we can expand the solution in terms of these eigenvectors as @xmath63 the time - dependent coefficients @xmath64 obey the following equation : @xmath65 by making a change of variable to @xmath66 the evolution of @xmath67 is obtained as @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that the assumption of adiabaticity implies that the coefficients @xmath72s or @xmath73s are independent of time .",
    "the time - variation of these coefficients is governed by the terms @xmath74 , which essentially give rise to non - adiabatic effects . from the eigenvectors in eqs.(@xmath75 ) , we derive the following : @xmath76 where @xmath77 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\frac{d\\omega_c}{dt}. \\label{eq35}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all @xmath78s are zero , and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "then , finally we can express the coefficients @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 of our initial basis of the bare states in ( [ eq8 ] ) in terms of these solutions as @xmath83    from the above equations , it is quite evident that the non - adiabatic perturbation , which is proportional to @xmath84 , becomes large in the storage and retrieval process as @xmath5 becomes small . thus we solve eqs.([eq27 ] ) for @xmath73s numerically . for simplicity , we take the phase of the control field , @xmath85 , and the optical detuning , @xmath86 .",
    "the latter would imply that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , leading to considerable numerical simplification .",

    "the idea is to find the optimal parameters and develop an understanding of the dynamics of the transfer processes . a quantitative comparison with berry s superadiabatic theory is presented in section 4.2 ( see table 1 ) .      for the storage of a single photon from the cavity to the atomic memory with the control field of the form ( [ eq50 ] ) , figure [ stog005 ] shows the fidelity ( [ eqfidelity ] ) as a function of time ( in units of @xmath152 ) for a relative signal field @xmath153 without dissipation ( @xmath154 ) at ( a ) , and with dissipation at ( b ) @xmath155 , ( c ) @xmath156 , and ( d ) @xmath157 , for different rates of variation @xmath115 ( in units of @xmath119 ) = 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 and 0.8 of the control field in each case . figures [ stog01 ] and [ stog02 ] show the same set of results for higher signal field strengths , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "note that the variation of the control field ( [ eq50 ] ) ends as it drops to zero at @xmath160 , and indeed one finds that there is no change in fidelity values after this time .",
    "we first comment on the results without dissipation . in figure [ stog005](a )",
    ", one sees that the fidelities saturate to higher values as @xmath149 decreases , for example , @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "thus fidelity of storage is better with a slow variation of the control field , as expected from the adiabatic theory .",

    "next we examine how the fidelity depends on the signal strength .",
    "this variation is shown for a range of values of @xmath150 from 0.05 to 0.2 , in figures [ stog005](a ) to [ stog02](a ) for zero dissipation .",
    "it is seen that the fidelity increases with an increase of @xmath150 , leading to @xmath165 for @xmath166 at @xmath167 .",
    "this can be understood easily as the non - adiabatic perturbation ( proportional to @xmath84 ) becomes large when @xmath110 , and it is larger , smaller the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we now examine the effect of dissipation .",
    "this is shown in figures [ stog005]-[stog02 ] in panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) with increasing values of @xmath151 .",
    "we see that with dissipation , the fidelities decrease , though the difference becomes marginal as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath149 follows the same trend of decreasing fidelities with increasing @xmath149 , but is marginal for large @xmath3 .",
    "note that for a given system , @xmath3 is a fixed parameter ; however , here the dissipation rate is scaled by @xmath119 and hence its variation physically implies the inverse variation of the control laser power .    to give a detailed picture of the evolution of our solution for @xmath168 , the plots for the probability densities @xmath169 and @xmath170 of finding the system in the states @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively , are shown in figure [ stoabc ] in case of @xmath158 . on the left - hand side are the plots for no dissipation while on the right - hand side are those with dissipation at @xmath174 . in storage , as @xmath175 , the dark state approaches @xmath173 .",
    "thus @xmath170 should be large at the end of the process .",
    "however , without dissipation , this is marginally fulfilled for the smallest rate @xmath166 , and in the presence of dissipation , it is worse .",
    "next we turn to the retrieval of the photon from atomic memory with the control field of the form ( [ controlret ] ) .",
    "figure [ retg005 ] shows the fidelity ( [ eqfidelity ] ) of the retrieval process as a function of time ( in units of @xmath152 ) for a relative signal field @xmath153 without dissipation ( @xmath154 ) at ( a ) , and with dissipation at ( b ) @xmath155 , ( c ) @xmath156 , and ( d ) @xmath157 , for different rates of variation @xmath115 ( in units of @xmath119 ) = 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 and 0.8 of the control field in each case .",

    "thus the adiabaticity expectations are not quite fulfilled .",
    "this difference in the behavior of fidelity between storage and retrieval is easily understood by recognizing that for retrieval the non - adiabatic perturbation is the largest at the beginning of the procedure whereas for storage it is the largest toward the end of the procedure .",
    "as seen from figures [ retg005](b)-(d ) , with dissipation the behavior is complex . for low dissipation rates ( or high control power )",
    ", the fidelity improves considerably but the behavior is non - monotonic .",
    "the best results are achieved with @xmath155 and hereafter the results deteriorate with decreasing control power .",
    "surprisingly , for retrieval we find that in the presence of dissipation , the general wisdom of adiabaticity is not followed ; instead , the fidelity is better as @xmath149 increases ( except for very weak signal intensity , when @xmath176 , not shown here ) .    in figures [ retg01 ] and [ retg02 ] , we mark the effect of the signal strength .",

    ", there is an optimum value of @xmath3 ( or control power ) at which the best fidelities are achieved .",
    "the behavior with respect to @xmath149 shows the same unexpected trend .    again , to give a detailed picture of the evolution of our solution for @xmath168 , the plots for @xmath177 , given in ( [ eq30])-([eq32 ] ) with the coefficients @xmath148s generalized to the @xmath144s in ( [ eq79 ] ) , are shown for the retrieval process in figure [ retabc ] in case of @xmath158 . on the left - hand side",
    "are the plots for no dissipation while on the right - hand side are those with dissipation at @xmath174 . for retrieval , as @xmath178 , the dark state approaches @xmath179 ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "so , @xmath180 should be large at the end of the process .",
    "however , as we find in figure [ retabc ] , @xmath180 is quite small without dissipation , but improves on inclusion of dissipation and it is better for a fast variation of the control field .",
    "it is finally noted that for slow rates of change of the control laser , the non - adiabatic corrections in the quantum evolution _ without dissipation _ can be estimated from the superadiabatic transfer procedure given by berry @xcite .",

    "the non - adiabatic perturbations are strong and we do not expect the superadiabatic formula to give reliable results .",
    "in general , for small @xmath149 , the superadiabatic theory overestimates the fidelity , whereas at large @xmath149 , it underestimates the fidelity .",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the core problem of adiabatic transfer driven by a control laser for a single three - level atom confined to a high - finesse optical cavity .",
    "we have studied the problem numerically by using instantaneous eigenstates of the system , and obtained results with and without dissipation .",
    "the dissipation in our case is included by allowing for spontaneous decay of the uppermost level of the @xmath0-configuration . without the inclusion of dissipation ,",
    "our results concur with the adiabatic idea of increased fidelity for slower variation of the control field .",
    "the dependence on the rate @xmath115 of variation is much weaker for the retrieval of the photon than for its storage , especially for weak cavity - atom coupling .",
    "the fidelities of both the processes are better for higher coupling at any rate of variation of the control field .    in the presence of dissipation",
    ", the fidelity of storage still follows the adiabatic property ; however , it gets worse with higher dissipation , particularly at slow variations of the control field . for a given cavity - atom coupling ,",
    "the fidelity of the storage process is better for higher ratios of control powers ( rabi frequency ) to the spontaneous decay rate @xmath3 .    on the other hand , in the case of retrieval , the behavior with dissipation is non - monotonic . for an optimal control power @xmath119 ,",
    "whose value depends on the spontaneous decay rate @xmath3 of the system concerned , the fidelity with dissipation is , in fact , better than that without dissipation , the best being at @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , in the presence of dissipation , contrary to the adiabatic idea , retrieval fidelities are higher for faster rates of variation of the control field .    in general , we conclude that an optimal dissipation aids the retrieval process but not the storage .",
    "further , we find that the fidelity for storing is better , the stronger the control field and the slower the rate of its switching off . for the best fidelity of retrieval",
    ", however , there is an optimal power for the control laser dependent on the dissipation rate  the faster the switching rate , the better is the retrieval .",
    "our results lend themselves to experimental tests .",
    "this quantum state transfer protocol , of course , has other practical limitations of implementation , e.g. , residual atomic motion in the trap effectively reducing the atom - cavity coupling , imperfect preparation of the initial single - photon state in the cavity , etc .",
    "we have concentrated on the idealized model of a single atom trapped in a high - finesse cavity , which is relevant for studying the non - adiabatic issues discussed here in the presence of dissipation .    for various quantum information processing protocols",
    ", one needs to either couple the three - level atom to external photon channels or deal with several atoms .",
    "the full quantum mechanics of adiabatic transfer in such situations is highly complicated due to the enlarged hilbert space of quantum states as well as the more complex dissipative processes .",
    "we feel that our present analysis is a useful input for tackling such problems , and some work is in progress in this direction .",
