    "there are several different approaches to the fundamental concept of fractional poisson process ( fpp ) on the real line .",
    "the renewal  approach consists of considering the characterization of the poisson process as a sum of independent non - negative random variables , and instead of the assumption that these random variables have an exponential distribution , we assume that they have the mittag - leffler distribution ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite , the renewal approach to the fractional poisson process is developed and it is proved that its one - dimensional distributions coincide with the solution to fractionalized state probabilities .",
    "another equivalent approach is using inverse subordinator , a kind of fractional poisson process can be constructed @xcite .    in @xcite , following this method , the fpp is generalized and defined , obtaining a fractional poisson random field ( fprf ) parametrized by points of the euclidean space @xmath0 , as it has been done for fractional brownian fields , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our extension will be the set - indexed poisson process which is a well - known concept , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in this paper , we first present a martingale characterization of the fractional poisson process .",
    "we extend this characterization to fprf using the concept of increasing path and strong martingales .",
