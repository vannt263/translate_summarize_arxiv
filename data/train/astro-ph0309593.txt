    "consider quantum field theory in the presence of a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat geometry , @xmath0 by virtue of spatial translation invariance we can label particle states by their constant wave vectors , @xmath1 .",
    "however , the physical 3-momentum associated with this label is @xmath2 .",
    "and if such a particle has mass @xmath3 , its energy is , @xmath4 now consider the appearance , at time @xmath5 , of a pair of virtual particles with wave vectors @xmath6 .",
    "this process conserves 3-momentum but not energy .",
    "according to the energy - time uncertainty principle this violation of energy conservation will not be detectable provided the pair disappears back into the vacuum before a time interval @xmath7 such that , @xmath8 for any @xmath9 the integral grows without bound , so @xmath7 is finite for massive particles .",
    "however , if @xmath10 and the scale factor grows rapidly enough , the integral remains bounded even for @xmath11 .",
    "this means that massless virtual particles need never recombine .",
    "`` rapidly enough '' turns out to mean @xmath12 , which is a type of expansion known as `` inflation '' @xcite . whether or not inflation leads to a significant amount of particle production for a given species depends upon the rate at which virtual particles of that species emerge from the vacuum",
    "it turns out that the emergence rate for particles which are conformally invariant falls like @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this means that any conformally invariant and massless virtual particles which happen to emerge from the vacuum will become real , but not many emerge . hence there is negligible direct production of conformally invariant particles during inflation .",
    "most familiar massless particles possess conformal invariance .",
    "in particular , photons are conformally invariant in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions , and massless dirac fermions are conformally invariant in any dimension . on the other hand , neither massless , minimally coupled scalars nor gravitons",
    "are conformally invariant , and both are produced copiously during inflation .",
    "this effect is observable ; the production of nearly massless , minimally coupled scalars is believed to be responsible for the primordial anisotropies in the cosmic ray microwave background @xcite .",
    "one naturally wonders what happens when a massless but conformally invariant particle interacts with a massless particle which is not conformally invariant . the first step in answering",
    "this question is to compute the one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) 2-point function of the conformally invariant field .",
    "one next uses this 1pi 2-point function to correct the linearized equations of motion .",
    "the effect of inflation on the conformally invariant particle can be inferred by solving these equations for the plane wave mode functions .",
    "we have previously carried out such a study for photons interacting with a charged , massless and minimally coupled scalar @xcite .",
    "the result is that the mode functions of super - horizon wave vectors oscillate around a nonzero constant with increasing frequency and decreasing amplitude @xcite .",
    "this implies zero photon production and an enormous enhancement in the 0-point energy , roughly similar to what happens for massive photons in proca electrodynamics .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the inflationary production of charged scalars results in a diffuse plasma which inhibits the propagation of light .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study what happens when dirac fermions are made to yukawa - interact with a real , massless and minimally coupled scalar .",
    "we will show that although the fermion mass remains zero , the mode functions for super - horizon wave vectors grow in a manner that is consistent with the production of fermions .",
    "the physical interpretation seems to be that inflation alters the constraint of energy conservation to permit the spontaneous appearance of a scalar and a fermion - anti - fermion pair .    in section",
    "ii we compute the one loop fermion self energy . in section iii",
    "this is used to correct the dirac equation .",
    "although this equation is nonlocal , an asymptotic form is derived for the late time behavior of a spatial plane wave . in section",
    "iv we show that the particle production inferred from the mode functions is consistent with a 3-particle creation process .",

    "one gets a quite good approximation for the exponent of the wkb mode function  ( [ limform ] ) we found in section iii .",
    "we have found that the effect of inflation on yukawa - coupled , massless fermions is in some ways opposite to the effect on the photons of massless scalar qed . whereas the photon becomes massive , but suffers no significant particle production @xcite , we find that fermions remain massless but experience enormous particle production .",
    "the physical mechanism is simple : inflation alters the constraint of energy conservation so that three massless particles can spontaneously emerge from the vacuum .",
    "the yukawa interaction mediates this for a scalar and a fermion - anti - fermion pair , and the process has an appreciable amplitude when the scalar is minimally coupled .",
    "the mathematical analysis for yukawa - coupled fermions is quite different from that required for photons in scalar qed .",
    "although the mode equations of both systems are nonlocal , the integrals of the fermion system are dominated by their upper limits because the fermion mode function grows .",
    "this means that we need only drop exponentially suppressed terms and then differentiate to extract a local equation for the asymptotic form .",
    "the photon mode equations were much more subtle because the photon mode function approaches a nonzero constant  as do classical photons  and the asymptotic effect of vacuum polarization shows up in the increasingly rapid oscillations around this value .",
    "of course fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle , so at most one particle can be put in each momentum and spin state .",
    "the amplitude of the wave function can not really grow past that point .",
    "therefore the rate of production for any particular momentum and spin state must go to zero as the probability of this state being occupied approaches unity .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _",
    "pauli blocking_. we do not see pauli blocking because we are using only the one loop self energy .",
    "we expect pauli blocking to appear at two loop order .",

    "so the sign correction brings our results for yukawa into pleasant conformity with what charged scalars do to photons during inflation  @xcite . in each case",
    "inflationary particle production forces the scalar away from zero , whereupon the effect on other fields is qualitatively similar ( but not in every detail ! ) to what happens for nonzero scalar backgrounds in symmetry breaking .    note that the sign change reported here does not affect either the one loop yukawa scalar self - mass - squared or its impact on plane wave scalar mode functions  @xcite .",
