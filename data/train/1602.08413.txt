    "in many physical systems the state space , the space of all possible outcomes , changes with time . when the size of state space decreases as a function of time , the process is termed state ( or sample ) space reducing ( ssr ) . examples of such processes are quite common  @xcite and instances can be drawn from fields as diverse as material fracture  @xcite to sentence formation or predictive text algorithms in linguistics .",
    "the space reduction may be stochastic , and on occasion the size of state space may expand : such systems are referred as noisy ssr processes .",
    "current interest in ssr processes arises from the possibility of such dynamics offering an `` explanation '' of the origin of zipf s law  @xcite or other scale  invariant features observed in complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the widespread occurrence of scale invariant features in a variety of natural systems has prompted a number of hypotheses and theories , ranging from multiplicative random process  @xcite , self - organized criticality  @xcite , and , in the context of complex networks , preferential attachment  @xcite .",
    "our interest here is primarily on survival ",
    "time statistics in the stochastic ssr process . since the ssr problem is exactly solvable , the survival time probability distribution can be easily computed .",
    "the mean survival time is an important observable that quantifies physically relevant features of random events that are modelled by a stochastic process with an absorbing boundary condition .",
    "some examples include diffusive search with stochastic resetting  @xcite , diminishing record statistics  @xcite , and the plya urn process  @xcite",
    ".    the stochastic ssr process can be described as follows .",
    "denote the size of state space at time @xmath9 by @xmath10",
    ". the time evolution of @xmath11 can be through a discrete map or via flow equations , depending upon whether variables such as the time and the size of state space are discrete or continuous .",
    "if both are discrete , for example , then @xmath11 takes integer values and has the automaton dynamics x(t+1 ) = g[x(t ) ] , where @xmath12 is a random function . at initial time , @xmath2 , and @xmath13 if @xmath14",
    "the process stops at @xmath15 , when @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath5 is a random variable that corresponds to the survival time or life span of the process ; @xmath16 is a fixed point or an absorbing state since the state of system can not change when the size of the state space is 1 .",
    "the case of continuous time or real - valued processes can be analogously described .",
    "an interesting ( and subtle ) connection has been noted between the statistics of survival time of the ssr process and the _ record _ statistics of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables  @xcite . recall that an event is termed a record if it betters ( or exceeds ) all previous instances .",
    "the total number of records in a sequence of random variables has been of interest in many applications , and the record statistics of uncorrelated events such as a stochastic time series modelled by iid random variables is well understood . the striking feature in record events of such processes",
    "is the existence of power - law distribution for the probability that a record would form after @xmath17th time step in a sequence of length @xmath6 , namely , @xmath18",
    "it is here identified that the survival time of the ssr process is equivalent to the total number of records .",
    "the stochastic ssr process is therefore of wider consequence .",
    "our main result in this paper is an analytic expression for the survival probability in a model stochastic ssr process .",
    "both the mean as well as the variance of the survival time have a logarithmic dependence on the initial size of the state space .",
    "we also present simulation results that are in excellent agreement .",
    "the model that we study is presented in sec .",
    "ii and analytical results for the quantities of interest are also given here .",
    "subsequently numerical results for the survival time statistics of the ssr process are presented in sec .",
    "the equivalence between record statistics of iid random variables and the statistics of the survival times in the ssr process is discussed in sec .",
    "iv , and the paper concludes with a summary and a brief discussion in sec .  v.",

    "this can be visualised as a sequence of throws of fair dice with @xmath24 faces at time @xmath9 , with @xmath20 being the outcome of the throw ( see fig .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and it can be easily shown recursively that for integer @xmath5 , n _ = n-1 .",

    "further , in the large @xmath6 limit , with @xmath36 small , keeping the leading order term in the logarithmic expansion , we finally get the relation ~(1- ) +   o(^3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the scaling function has the form of the logistic equation in the variable @xmath37 .      to compute the survival probability distribution we proceed in the following manner .",
    "consider the case of @xmath39 for instance .",
    "for @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 there would be @xmath43 terms that need to be summed , giving @xmath44 .",
    "working upwards , one can deduce , @xmath45 .",

    "i=1^n__k=1 ^ -1p(k ) .",

    "the recursion relation in eq .",
    "( [ spr ] ) is the most useful .",
    "further , in the continuum limit of @xmath6 , the difference equation  ( [ spr ] ) can be expressed as a differential equation = . in order to solve this",

    "= 1^n_n ( ) z^-1 , [ gf ] and then in terms of the generating function the differential equation reduces as = ( z-1)f(n , z ) , [ gfdeq ] with initial condition @xmath56 , giving solution f(n , z ) = .",
    "[ gf1 ]    with the help of this generating function , it is easy to see that the normalization is @xmath57 , the mean survival time is -1 = |_z=1 = n , and the second factorial moment is ( -1)(-2 ) = |_z=1 = ( n)^2 .",
    "thus , the variance is given as _",

    "[ sd_pd ] the survival time is a discrete random variable with poisson probability distribution , but note that @xmath58 and the equation  ( [ gfdeq ] ) is only consistent when the upper limit of the survival time , i.e. , @xmath6 is large .",

    "we observe that these two curves do nt show a good agreement , suggesting that higher order corrections to the scaling function dominate .",

    "we have also checked these features through simulations that agree well with the theoretical results . a map between the survival time statistics of the ssr process and the record statistics of iid random variables has been found .",
