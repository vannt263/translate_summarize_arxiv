    "recently , the central exclusive charmonia production has attracted a lot of attention from both experimental [ ] and theoretical [ ] sides .",
    "such a process provides the unique opportunity to test the qcd diffractive khoze - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) mechanism [ ] based on @xmath2-factorisation incorporating nonperturbative small-@xmath3 gluon dynamics described by the unintegrated gluon distribution functions ( ugdfs ) against accessible data .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to analyze polarisation effects in the central exclusive charmonia production .",
    "such effects can be identified potentially by measuring the angular distribution of @xmath4 mesons from radiative decays of @xmath5 giving more detailed information on partial spin contributions . moreover",
    ", certain combinations of polarisation observables can be less sensitive to unknown nonperturbative effects leading to unique opportunities for model - independent analysis of diffractive processes .",
    "according to the khoze - martin - ryskin approach ( kmr ) [ ] , we write the amplitude of the exclusive double diffractive color singlet production @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions for `` active '' gluons with momenta @xmath9 and color indices @xmath10 , and the screening soft gluon with small fraction @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin and helicity of a produced meson with momentum @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 in the center - of - mass frame of colliding protons and @xmath16 axis directed along the meson momentum @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "hard subprocess parts @xmath18 were calculated previously in refs .",
    "[ ] , and we will not shown them explicitly here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chic ] we show differential distributions of the central exclusive @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath1 ( right ) production cross section in rapidity @xmath19 for different meson polarisations @xmath20 ( calculated with kmr ugdf [ ] ) .",
    "they exhibit maxima / minima in the central rapidity region @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly enough , these maxima / minima in partial helicity contributions cancel each other in the total ( summed over all meson helicity states ) cross section , which has a regular and smooth behavior around @xmath22 .",

    "this confirms that the appearance of non - maximal helicities is a kinematical effect absent in the spin - averaged cross - section .",
    "we do not take into account the absorbtive effects here as they can , in principle , differ for different meson polarisations .",
    "let us consider the central exclusive production process @xmath28 followed by the radiative decays @xmath29 .",
    "below we follow notations in ref .  [ ] .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the polar and azimuthal angles of the @xmath4 meson in the respective coordinate system of @xmath5 rest frame ( this is so - called helicity frame ) .",
    "then , the angular distribution of the @xmath4 meson from @xmath0 meson in the general form reads @xmath30 + \\rho^1_{1,1}\\left[r^1_0\\sin^2\\theta+ \\frac{r^1_1}{2}(1+\\cos^2\\theta)\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber & \\qquad\\qquad-\\sqrt{2}\\sin(2\\theta)\\left(r^1_0-\\frac{r^1_1}{2}\\right ) [ \\mathrm{re}(\\rho^1_{1,0})\\cos\\phi-\\mathrm{im}(\\rho^1_{1,0})\\sin\\phi]\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad-\\sin^2\\theta\\left(r^1_0-\\frac{r_1 ^ 1}{2}\\right ) [ \\mathrm{re}(\\rho^1_{1,-1})\\cos(2\\phi)-\\mathrm{im}(\\rho^1_{1,-1})\\sin(2\\phi)]\\biggr\\ } , \\label{jpsi-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the diffractive production density matrix , @xmath32 total ( summed over all meson polarisations @xmath13 ) production cross section , and @xmath33 corresponding expression for tensor @xmath1 meson is much more complicated , and we do not show it here .",

    "( [ jpsi-1 ] ) it follows that dependence on the polar angle @xmath23 is determined mostly by diagonal terms of the production density matrix @xmath35 , whereas @xmath24-dependence is given by real and imaginary parts of non - diagonal terms .",
